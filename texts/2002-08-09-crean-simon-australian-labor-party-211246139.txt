 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, ALP NATIONAL SECRETARIAT, CANBERRA - 9TH AUGUST 2002.

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 Subjects: ALP Party Reform; High Court decision of Refugee Tribunal.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean what do you rate your chances of success today?

 CREAN: I’m determined to push through the reforms that modernise the Labor Party by making it more inclusive, by making it easier to join, for Party members to have a greater say and ownership in their Party. And to define the relationship with the trade union movement based around policy and their input into policy. What I have today is a blueprint by which those reforms can be implemented and I’m determined to achieve those reforms.

 JOURNALIST: Have you prevailed in reducing union representation at the National Conference to 50%?

 CREAN: The recommendation is for 50/50 to replace 60/40 and that’s what I’ll be taking to the National Conference.

 JOURNALIST: Is your leadership relying on these reforms?

 CREAN: Look, the Party’s future rides on these reforms. I know that and I think a lot of people in the community and a lot of people in the Party understand that and we will have sensible discussions about the implementation of these recommendations. But the opportunity here is to modernise ourselves and to state our values to a broader community. Values of openness, values of honesty and values of equality and you can’t talk equality unless you’re prepared to implement it in your own Party.

 JOURNALIST: Your leadership does it also ride on these reforms?

 CREAN: I am determined to implement these reforms. I believe it’s important for the Party to present itself as a much more inclusive,

 connected, open Party and it’s leadership that I am giving to that direction that I’m sure we’ll prevail.

 JOURNALIST: Would you like to be a leader that saw more women representation?

 CREAN: Yes.

 JOURNALIST: … come into the Party?

 CREAN: Yes, I would. And I’m determined to get more women into Parliament. But in 1994 Labor introduced a target of 35% women, as a ceiling. We have been spectacularly successful in achieving that target. We’ve seen the number of women representing the Labor Party in parliaments around the country double. In the same period the Liberals have gone backwards. What the recommendation in the report does is to turn that ceiling into a floor. Now, I’m determined to get more women into the Parliament, but the question as to the best way of achieving that still requires some discussions and we will have those discussions.

 JOURNALIST: Wouldn’t it be best to stick with a proven … then if the 35% rule worked to there, why not go to 50 with it?

 CREAN: The 35% changed the culture, the culture has been changed, it’s time for that rule to be reviewed and it will be reviewed. But significantly what this Report does is to say, don’t go backwards go forward. See it as a floor not a ceiling and I think that is a significant recommendation upon which the Party must build.

 JOURNALIST: The Daily Telegraph has accused you of naval gazing, what did you think of that headline?

 CREAN: The only naval gazing that I’ve been doing is looking at a proper coastguard for this country. I am determined to implement good policy for the nation but if we’re to demonstrate our bonafides to the Australian people we’ve got to show that we’re intent on applying those principles internally first so that the nation can have confidence that what I lead the Party for I will also lead the country for.

 JOURNALIST: Have you got the numbers all stitched up for this executive meeting?

 CREAN: Well executives are always places for good input, good constructive discussion but I am determined to pursue the recommendations contained in this report. I expect to get the support of the Executive to take those recommendations forward.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean on another issue, yesterday’s High Court decision on asylum seekers, what’s your reaction to that?

 CREAN: Well I have consistently said in this debate, we need to have a system that processes more quickly and more fairly. What we’re now being told is that the Government who said it had all under control has got a system that seems to have some major problems. Now I haven’t seen the full detail of the decision, it’s a very long decision, as I understand it, I want to properly consider it. But for a Government that says it’s got the problem fixed, it’s another example of its solution coming apart at the seams.

 JOURNALIST: Could this become a bit of a disaster, I mean is it going to clog up the legal system again seeing these all reviewed?

 CREAN: I don’t know. I think that we need to have proper analysis of the decision. I think it would be silly to rush to judgement about it. But the point is, I’ve been arguing for the need for us to have a faster and fairer system for processing and one that works. If the High Court decision has the ramifications that people talk about clearly the current system isn’t working and it’s another reason why it needs an overhaul and we need to get a lasting solution. But I repeat my offer to the Prime Minister. I’m prepared to work with him to get that lasting solution and just look at what can happen when you work together. The LNG project, which was announced yesterday, was a great win for the nation and for both sides of politics, State and Federal, because all players in the game, in political and industry have been up lobbying in Australia’s interests. It’s a great example of bipartisanship, Government and industry, both sides of politics working together for the benefit the nation and I want to see more of that.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean if the reforms don’t get up in October will you stand down as Leader?

 CREAN: The reforms will get up. I’m determined to see them get up.

 ENDS.
