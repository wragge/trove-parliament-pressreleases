 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  Senator the Hon. Bob Carr  November 29, 2012    

 AUSTRALIA SUPPORTS VULNERABLE IN THE DEMOCRATIC  REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO   Foreign Minister Bob Carr today announced an additional $5 million to the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to help those fleeing conflict  in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).   Senator  Carr  said  the  funding  is  in  response  to  recent  violence  in  and  around   Goma in the DRC.  “Conflict between  the  M23  rebel group  and  the  National Army has triggered  an   upsurge in displaced people,” Senator Carr said.   “There are now 2.4 million internally displaced people across the country.  “There  has  been  widespread  abuse  of  civilians  including  murder,  rape  and  the   forced recruitment of children by armed groups.   “Australia’s  funding  will  help  support  an  expected  400,000  internally  displaced   people  by  providing  1,000  shelter  kits  and  water  and  sanitation  services  to   vulnerable people in North Kivu and Province Orientale in the north-west of the  country.  “Our support will also improve the safety of those most at risk, such as women  and children, by supporting protection initiatives that combat sexual and gender-based violence.  “The UNHCR is one  of  Australia’s key partners for the  delivery of  humanitarian  assistance.  “We  are  proud  to  support UNHCR’s work  in  delivering  assistance  to  more  than   33 million people most in need around the world.  “Last  year,  Australia  helped  UNHCR  to  support  more  than  740,000  people  in   desperate  need  in  countries  such  as  Afghanistan,  Pakistan,  Liberia,  Libya,   Myanmar and Somalia.”
