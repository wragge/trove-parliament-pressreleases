 Democrats Deliver A Fair Budget for Australians   

 The Australian Democrats today released a Budget delivering a fair go for all Australians with a  focus on the nation’s future. 

 Democrats’ Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, predicted John Howard and Peter Costello’s Tuesday  Budget would have the wrong focus and the wrong bottom line. 

 “The Democrats are concerned the Budget will look for short term political gain at the expense of  the future.  It will be a Budget for war and a war-chest for a possible early election,” Senator  Bartlett said. 

 “But it should be a fair Budget that delivers for families, where education and our hospitals are  properly funded, that keeps us all secure and protects the environment.” 

 Senator Bartlett released a costed, realistic, balanced Budget to fund such a vision. 

 “It is a responsible and viable alternative to the Budget we are likely to see Tuesday night.  I say to  Peter Costello: there is still time to make our ideas your own, we won’t mind. 

 “The Democrats’ Budget provides funding for paid maternity leave, better work and family  measures, education and health. 

 “It funds important environmental initiatives to head off a looming crisis in rural and urban water  and a national strategy to address invasive weeds and pests that are decimating our natural plants  and animals. 

 “It also provides for investment in regional development and infrastructure. 

 “Our Budget increases foreign aid, turning Australia into a better global citizen and lifting us from  near bottom of the international ladder for countries contributing overseas assistance. 

 “We have budgeted for a better deal for refugees on temporary protection visas. 

 “Spending on social services is increased to assist older Australians to receive home based care,  more funding is directed to affordable housing and services for people with disabilities. 

 “This sounds like a big agenda.  It is and it should be.  The Budget should be more than boasting  about the size of the surplus,” Senator Bartlett said. 

 “The Democrats recognise the money has to come from somewhere.  We have identified sources for  this revenue including reducing the unfair tax concessions on negative gearing, family trusts and  fringe benefits tax concessions on company cars. 

 “We also want to redirect the First Home Owners Grant to affordable housing for low to moderate  income earners and means test the private health insurance rebate. 

 “The bottom line is a Budget that is fairer and more sustainable than the Howard and Costello  Budget we are likely to see Tuesday night.”
