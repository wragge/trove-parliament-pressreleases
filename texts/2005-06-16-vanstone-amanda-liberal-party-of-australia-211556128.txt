 More Long-Term Detainees to be Considered for the Removal  Pending Bridging Visa 

 VPS 075/2005

 Minister for Immigration, Amanda Vanstone, announced today that regulations for the Removal Pending Bridging (RPB) Visa  had been revised.

 ‘This move has been taken to broaden the number of long-term detainees who can be considered for this visa,’ the Minister  said.

 ‘It is part of the Government’s commitment to constantly review the detention caseload to identify cases where alternative  arrangements could be considered.

 ‘The revised regulations come into effect today.’

 The Minister said that the visa was aimed at those detainees who, for a variety of reasons outside of their own control, could  not be removed in the near future.

 The RPB Visa, which came into effect on 11 May, was intended to create such a mechanism.

 ‘However, early experience with the visa has indicated that some requirements, such as that relating to litigation, limited my  opportunities to consider inviting some individuals to consider the visa,’ the Minister said.

 ‘Another requirement, that people sign an undertaking to cooperate with removal if and when it was possible, has been  removed. However, if people do not cooperate with removal once removal is possible, their visa is subject to cancellation.

 ‘Finally, I considered that if I had allowed a person to lodge a second visa application due to new information, they should  also be eligible for consideration for the RPB Visa,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘Consequently the requirements relating to subsequent application visa processing and litigation have been removed.

 The Minister said the Government was keen to ensure the RPB visa met its original intentions and was generally available  where removal was not yet possible.

 ‘The caseload is now being reviewed to identify which detainees potentially meet the revised criteria,’ the Minister said.

 ‘I expect to be able to announce initial estimates of those being considered under the new criteria in the near future.’
