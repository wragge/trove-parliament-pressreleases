  Reassessment of Afghani Nationals in Mainland Immigration  Detention 

  VPS 103/2004 

  Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone, today said the Department of  Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) was about to commence  reassessing asylum seeker claims by Afghani nationals in Australian mainland immigration  detention. 

  'I announced late last year that the claims of Afghani asylum seekers on Nauru would be  reassessed in light of new information, provided by the UNHCR, about changed  circumstances in parts of Afghanistan,' Senator Vanstone said. 

  'That reassessment has been completed and 139 of the Afghans on Nauru who were  assessed t o  be in need of refugee protection have been resettled to Australia. 

  'With that process now complete, it is appropriate to reassess the caseload on the Australian  mainland. 

  'The majority of the 86 cases to be reassessed are in immigration detention in Baxter, near  Port Augusta. 

  'Interviews with Afghani nationals in Baxter will commence next week. 'Interviews with other  affected Afghans in immigration detention will commence the following week.' 

  The Minister stressed the reassessments would be conducted on a case-by-case basis and no  one should pre-judge any outcomes. 

  'It should not be assumed that this process will lead to a different outcome for these people,'  Senator Vanstone said. 

  'However, I can give an absolute assurance that where people are found to now be in need of  protection, as a consequence of the changed circumstances in parts of Afghanistan, as  advised by the UNHCR, they will receive it. 

  'This is consistent with Australia's approach to ensuring people in need of protection receive it  under the Refugee and Humanitarian Program, which this financial year sees an increase of  2,000 in the number of refugees to be offered protection by Australia.

  'The reassessment does not apply to those who are excluded from refugee protection  because of issues such as character, or those who have had temporary protection visas  cancelled because they are Pakistanti nationals.'
