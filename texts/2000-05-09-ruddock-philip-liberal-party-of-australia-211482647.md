 New and Upgraded Detention Facilities MPS 048/2000 - Budget Media Release 3

 Immigration detention facilities are to be established in Darwin and Brisbane, and existing detention centres upgraded to accommodate the rising number of people in Australia illegally, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, announced today.

 "The number of unauthorised air and sea arrivals, and the number of overstayers located in the community, continues to rise each year," Mr Ruddock said.

 "The Government recognises that the problem of unauthorised air and sea arrivals needs to be addressed at the international level, and I have announced separately a range of initiatives in which Australia will assist and support source and transit countries to respond to the pressures they face.

 "In Australia, we need to make it crystal clear to those people who seek to abuse or avoid our border controls that they will be detained, as the law demands."

 Mr Ruddock said that last year the high number of unauthorised boat arrivals had led to the reopening of the Curtin centre in WA and the establishment of the Woomera, SA, facility. Other detention facilities had been operating close to capacity.

 "To relieve the pressure on existing facilities, the Government has decided to implement a long-term strategy that will see new centres established and older facilities upgraded.

 "This will ensure that there is sufficient appropriate accommodation for detainees in the future and that the Australian staff who have care of the people have satisfactory working conditions."

 Subject to a suitable site being available, work will start in 2000-2001 on a 500-bed

 Immigration Reception and Processing Centre (IRPC) at Darwin, primarily for unauthorised boat arrivals. Substantial additional capacity will be provided through flexible demountable accommodation, as required.

 Planning will commence in 2000-2001 for a new detention facility in Brisbane, to accommodate unauthorised air arrivals and overstayers. A 200-bed centre is expected to be operational in 2002-2003. Plans will include capacity for expansion in future years.

 "Brisbane is a major international airport with an increasing number of unauthorised arrivals. Currently there is limited detention capacity in Queensland. A small number can be detained at the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Facility in Brisbane, but the majority of detainees have to be flown at considerable expense to centres in other States. It is common sense to provide a detention centre locally," Mr Ruddock said.

 The Government has allocated $52.1 million over four years to establish the two new centres. The Minister said that the work associated with the long-term strategy was also in keeping with the Government's commitment to bring jobs and new businesses to rural and regional Australia.

 "Construction of the new facilities in Darwin and Brisbane will be undertaken by the private sector, with the centres being leased back to the Government, consistent with the Government's policy on property ownership.

 "This will result in major savings for the Commonwealth, while boosting local job opportunities," the Minister said.

 "We are also retaining the IRPC at Port Hedland and continuing to upgrade and consolidate the IRPC at Woomera. Both towns have experienced substantial economic and employment benefits from the detention facilities, now seen as major local industries.

 "As part of our comprehensive strategy, we expect that the current temporary detention facility at Curtin will close as we consolidate Woomera and develop the new Darwin centre."

 Mr Ruddock said that with unauthorised air arrivals and overstayer detainees increasing by 19 per cent and 26 per cent respectively in 1997-98 and 1998-99, the Immigration Detention Centres at Sydney, Melbourne and Perth were continually operating close to capacity.

 "We are refocussing the redevelopment of Villawood, Sydney - announced in the Budget of 1998 - to meet the new, emerging and changing needs of detention requirements in Sydney. "Maribyrnong in Melbourne will be refurbished in the next few years, resulting in increased accommodation and better facilities.

 "Our long-term plan for the small Perth centre is to replace it with a larger facility in the next few years," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Let me emphasise that the Government remains firmly committed to a policy of detention for people unlawfully in Australia.

 "It is important for people to understand that Australia is serious about protecting the

 integrity of its borders and that those who enter the country illegally or breach the terms of their visas will be detained."

 Budget Fact Sheet 2

 Long Term Strategy for the Provision of Detention Facilities

 Australia's Migration Act 1958 requires that any person unlawfully in Australia must be detained and that, unless they are granted permission to remain in Australia, they must be removed from Australia as soon as practicable.

 The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs administers the immigration detention function through the operation of immigration detention facilities.

 The Government has implemented a long-term strategy for the provision of immigration detention facilities to address the expected detention needs arising from unauthorised arrivals and the detection of overstayers or those who breach visa conditions.

 the Government will allocate $52.1 million over the next four years to build new immigration detention facilities in the Darwin and Brisbane regions including:

 the Darwin facility, which will incorporate core accommodation for 500 people with additional places provided through flexible demountable accommodation. The centre will be used primarily for unauthorised boat arrivals;
