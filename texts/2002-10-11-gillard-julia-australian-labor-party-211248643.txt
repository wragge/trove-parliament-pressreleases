 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 WHAT FUTURE FOR THE SO-CALLED PACIFIC SOLUTION?

 Papua New Guinea’s Foreign Minister, Sir Rabbie Namaliu, reportedly said today that he has reached agreement with Australia that the Manus Island detention facility will not be used to house any new boat arrivals.

 This curious news comes hot on the heels of a deal struck last month to extend the centre’s life by a year.  With Manus set to continue operating until at least October 2003, but an apparent deal that no new arrivals will be taken there, it is now even more vital that Minister Ruddock disclose all details of the new agreement.  The Minister refused to fully disclose the details of the initial 12-month agreement, but he must now come clean and confirm that Manus remains open only for existing detainees.

 There are only two conclusions to draw from this latest news when considered in conjunction with the one-year extension:

 1. The Minister is having a great deal of trouble finding resettlement places for those given the tick of approval as genuine refugees and wants to hold them there while he continues his charade of looking.

 OR

 2. The Minister knows he cannot effect returns of failed asylum seekers to Iraq and is detaining Iraqis indefinitely while he dithers.

 Either way, the so-called Pacific Solution continues to degenerate into a farce worthy of the stage.
