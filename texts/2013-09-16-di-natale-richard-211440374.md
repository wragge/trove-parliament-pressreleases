 Media Release   

 16/09/2013   

 Abbott turns his back on 21st century priorities   

 Australian Greens spokesperson, Senator Richard Di Natale, said today that the  announcement of Tony Abbott’s front bench ignores the major challenges of the 21st  century.   

 “Tony Abbott has made an art out of ignoring the science of climate change so it’s no  surprise that he has failed to include science or research in his front bench,” said  Senator Di Natale.    

 “It’s simply staggering that aged care, disabilities, housing and multiculturalism didn’t  warrant specific attention. Given Australia’s ageing population, the desperate situation  of worsening homelessness, the establishment of DisabilityCare and years spent  demonising refugees; one would have thought that each of these areas deserves to be  prioritised.   

 “Perhaps the most disappointing fact about Tony Abbott’s new Ministry is that he could  only find space for one woman in his Cabinet.    

 “He claims that there are many good and talented women knocking on the door of  Cabinet but he seems happy to keep the door locked. Both of the old parties could learn  something from the Greens, where almost two thirds of our party room are women.”
