  JOURNALIST: 

  

 Are you satisfied with the Treasurer’s explanation 
that the Government’s not providing cash for comment when it comes 
to charities and the GST?

  

  BEAZLEY: 

  

 Take a look at the contract. The code there is, ‘support 
us and you get the dud’. And this is classic cash for comments. The 
difference is, the cash, of course, comes from the taxpayer in this 
case, and the Treasurer can’t crawfish out of this one. This is yet 
another example of the Government misusing taxpayers’ dollars to advertise 
its own wares, and to effectively get people to advertise joyously being 
skinned.

  

  JOURNALIST: 

  

 But he says they’re free to criticise the policy.

  

  BEAZLEY: 

  

 Well, it’s always subliminal, isn’t it. It’s 
always pushing people in a particular direction, always making it a 
little bit harder for them. That’s what all this is about.

  

  JOURNALIST: 

  

 The Government’s suggesting that it’s a standard 
clause that was even used by Labor governments. Is that correct?

  

  BEAZLEY: 

  

 Take a look at what they’re doing with their advertising 
in relation to the GST. You have never seen such a cornucopia of government 
hands in the pockets of the Australian taxpayer to advertise its tax 
package and advertise the Government’s policy directions. This is 
unprecedented. There has been no government in this country that has 
been so willing to punish its opponents, so willing to use taxpayers’ 
dollars to push people to their point of view. This is just a part of 
it.

  

  JOURNALIST: 

  

 Has Meg Lees stuck her hand in the taxpayers’ pockets 
by agreeing to go on this junket to London?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, it’s escape from Alcatraz for the pair of 
them, isn’t it. They’ve got the sort of kapok vest out there. They’ve 
abandoned the citadel. The rest of us are left here paying the GST and 
off they go, GST-free, on the junket. I think it’s been pretty unwise 
for Meg to do that.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

  Bob Carr’s agreed to go. Is that wise?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 I think that the Premiers, of course, have got a capacity 
to sit up there and present their State’s wares. That’s, no doubt, 
the argument that they’ll make to defend their participation. But 
I think it’s all got a bit out of hand at the Commonwealth level, 
and I’m not surprised to see Meg wanting to be out of the country 
in July. It’s a very good month, if you’ve actually got part ownership 
of the GST, to be out of the country. But you know the great irony? 
It’s this: over here, we’ll all be paying the GST. Back here at 
home, you know, the old taxpayer is funding the trip. They’ll be paying 
the GST. Of course, in the UK, they’ll be paying the VAT. But the 
difference is, when they exit the airport, they reclaim the VAT. So, 
they’re having a GST-free week, while the rest of us launch gaily 
into that [GST] future.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 ... GST ... starting to sort of drip by drip into 
the system, and you’re thinking towards next July. Are you starting 
to lick your lips?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Look, I think the public is absolutely rock-ribbed 
against the Goods and Services Tax and, the more they find out about 
it, the more intrusive they find it, the more destructive they find 
it of the institutions which they value - like the charities - the more 
objection they’re developing. And this will only strengthen. Now, 
it won’t be enough, of course, for us simply to wander around saying, 
‘we’re opposed to the GST’. We’ll have to put forward policies 
on what we mean by ‘roll back’ and, of course, we have to put forward 
the policies that will deal with the next millennium. You know, the 
ones that John Howard skates away from - the things that create the 
knowledge nation, the things that ensure that our population is not 
of such a structure that we cannot afford out social security payments, 
the things that mean that our public health system works. These are 
the real issues of the next century. But, of course, the GST is going 
to be there, and that GST is fundamentally opposed by the Australian 
people, and rightly so.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 What do you think about Kerry Packer qualifying for 
free tickets to the Olympics, amid all of the ticket scandals we’ve 
seen so far?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, I’ve heard about that and I’m a bit surprised 
by it. But I don’t know the detail of it so, unless you know the detail, 
you don’t want to comment on these things. But I was a bit surprised 
that ... it was just mentioned to me as I came out that that was the 
case. But the Australian people, I think, have become all a bit sick 
of that ticket controversy associated with the Olympics. I just think 
they want to get on with it.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Are they more sick of the fact that they can’t get 
tickets ... like Kerry Packer can?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Oh, yes. Well, I mean, I think, I myself have turned 
down the free tickets that I’ve had, apart from where I think there’s 
official duty engaged, like attending the Opening and Closing ceremonies, 
and I think that’s the appropriate response. It’s particularly the 
appropriate response if you can afford it, and you don’t actually 
have a direct connection with the events that are taking place.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Is it fair enough for the Government to want to move 
all the East Timorese refugees into the one centre in Sydney, or are 
they being a bit tough with those out at the Leeuwin Barracks?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 They’ve got a Midas touch for heartlessness at the 
moment in this area. I mean, they’ve got so extreme in their rhetoric 
about illegal migrants and the rest of it, that they’re actually beginning 
to not be able to see the wood for the trees. We have got to take stands 
to ensure legality, as far as our immigration policies are concerned. 
But the wash-through now to the Timorese is completely unnecessary. 
They’re going home. The sensible thing to do is to send them home 
when the wet season is over. They want to go home, but they go home 
to nothing if they go home now. Now, when I was in Dili and these issues 
were raised with us by the CNRT, they have to get the folk out of West 
Timor. They must get them out of West Timor. They’re there in West 
Timor in life-threatening and health-threatening situations. And that 
is an enormous burden for them to bear. We can relieve that burden a 
little bit if we wait until the end of the wet season before we send 
these folk home. Why send them to Sydney? They’ve got 40-odd people 
who must stay in Perth for health reasons. Why not leave them all together?

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 So, withdrawing their privileges is a bit harsh?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Oh, look, it’s so typical, isn’t it, the schoolboy 
attitude of Ruddock. And, in this particular instance, it flies in the 
face of the charitable sense of the Australian people. He’ll gain 
nothing from this and he doesn’t deserve to.

  

  JOURNALIST: 

  

 And, just quickly, a 14 per cent monthly rise in new 
car sales. Are you still calling for better transitional arrangements?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Just ring the car dealers and ask them what’s going 
on. You’ll find that all of them are experiencing very substantial 
falls in their sales and they’re very worried. But they’re particularly 
worried about the early part of next year and the forward orders associated 
with that. The six-month lead up to the GST has got them very concerned, 
and they’re expecting very substantial falls.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 So, the 14 per cent rise is a one-off?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, I think everybody thinks that the first six 
months of next year is going to be the bad patch and they need appropriate 
transition arrangements for it. I think you’ll find when you inspect 
the innards of that 14 per cent, it ain’t quite what it seems.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Sir, relations between BHP and the mining unions in 
the West appear to be deteriorating over individual contracts. Have 
you got any advice for the parties over there?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Look, the Australian workers want to collectively 
bargain and the Australian workers want protection from awards. The 
Government’s industrial relations legislation is aimed at denying 
them, in real terms, the capacity for both. And it’s aimed at denying 
them the capacity to oblige companies to enter into those sorts of bargaining 
arrangements. If you want the answer of one of the fundamental reasons 
why many Australians now feel insecure and many Australians are expressing 
that insecurity through falling levels of home ownership and through 
a feeling that, even though the economy’s going reasonably well, they’re 
not benefiting from it. The answer lies in the industrial relations 
changes that this Government has put in place. And you’re just seeing 
small vignettes of it around the country now, and you’ve been seeing 
it for a while. And this is one of them.
