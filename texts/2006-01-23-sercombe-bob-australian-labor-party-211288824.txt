 Bob Sercombe MP  Federal Labor Shadow Minister for Overseas Aid   and Pacific Island Affairs   

 23 January 2006   

 West Papua 

 

 Labor’s Shadow Minister for Overseas Aid and Pacific Island Affairs has  proposed a new mechanism for encouraging dialogue between Australia and  Indonesia on West Papua.  

 

 “The arrival of West Papuan asylum seekers in Queensland is concerning, given  their claims of ongoing human rights issues in that province. Given these claims,  it is vital that Australia and Indonesia can discuss the situation in West Papua in  an open and transparent way,” said Mr Sercombe.    

 “When I visited Jakarta and Aceh in mid-2005, I suggested to President  Yudhoyono that the way ahead was to initiate a joint parliamentary visit to West  Papua.   

 

 “Such a visit would involve Australian and Indonesian parliamentarians, and  possibly also Papua New Guinean parliamentarians. It would promote  transparency and dialogue on the West Papua issue. The visit would be  premised on respect for Indonesia’s territorial integrity, but also the need to  ensure universal human rights standards are protected and promoted.    

 “Parliamentarians would gain a greater understanding of the realities in West  Papua, and the visit could serve as a catalyst for solutions on the ground.    

 “President Yudhoyono gave an encouraging response to my suggestion, as did  the Indonesian Ambassador to Australia when I raised it with him.   

 “In light of the arrival of the West Papuan asylum seekers, I believe that it is now  appropriate for the proposal to be more actively considered, so that Australia can  work with Indonesia on the issue of West Papua in a constructive way,”  concluded Mr Sercombe.   

 Mr Sercombe said he was impressed with the leadership of President  Yudhoyono, and believed that the Aceh peace package, which involves a  significant level of autonomy, is also encouraging.
