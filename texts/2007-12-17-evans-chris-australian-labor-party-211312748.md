 Four people detected at Ashmore Islands 

 Monday, 17 December 2007 

 Four people who arrived at Ashmore Islands in a small boat have been transferred to an  Australian Customs vessel, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans,  said today. 

 The boat was taking water late yesterday (subs: December 16) and the group was transferred  to the safety of the Customs vessel. 

 ‘In accordance with established procedures, the group will be transported to Christmas Island  for initial interviews and health checks,’ Senator Evans said. 

 ‘I am advised that all four people appear well. 

 ‘The group will stay on Christmas Island while the Department of Immigration and Citizenship  assesses their circumstances. 

 ‘The government stands firm in its commitment to close the offshore processing facilities on  Manus Island and Nauru. 

 ‘Unauthorised boat arrivals will continue to be processed on Christmas Island.’ 

 Senator Evans said the presence of the Customs vessel at Ashmore Islands is part of  Australia’s strong and effective whole-of-government border security arrangements. 

 ‘The handling of the group is consistent with the government’s firm but fair approach in dealing  with people who seek to enter Australia without authorisation,’ he said. 

 ‘This government will maintain an orderly migration system that encourages people to apply  through proper channels for visas to Australia,’ the minister added.
