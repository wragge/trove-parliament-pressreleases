 The Hon Julie Bishop MP 

 Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs 

 Deputy Leader of the Opposition 

 143 boats arrive under Labor 

 Monday, 05 July 2010  

 Since the Rudd-now-Gillard Labor Government weakened Australia’s border protection laws  in August 2008 there have been 143 boats carrying more than 6,700 people claiming asylum  in Australia.  

 The Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott was in Curtin with local Federal Member and  Deputy Leader of the Opposition Julie Bishop to unveil a mobile border protection billboard  following the latest boat arrival on Sunday. 

 “The Rudd-now-Gillard Government destroyed the integrity of Australia’s orderly immigration  program when they changed our border protection laws which put the people smuggling  trade back into business,” Ms Bishop said. 

 “Julia Gillard has admitted to being the principal architect and drafter of Labor’s border  protection policy, which has failed so monumentally. 

 “Under her policy the people smuggling trade has been reinvigorated and lives have been  put at risk as people seeking asylum make the dangerous ocean journey to Australia. 

 “The Rudd-now-Gillard Government’s failure to take responsibility for the surge in the people  smuggling trade and the record numbers of boats demonstrates that Labor cannot be trusted  to solve the problem. 

 “The Opposition have promised to reintroduce offshore processing, temporary protection  visas and to turn back the boats to restore order to our immigration system. 

 “Labor has changed leaders, but not its policies. 

 “The only way to restore integrity to our borders is to elect a Liberal Government,” Ms Bishop  said.
