 East Timorese Return Home from Temporary Safe Haven MPS 023/2000

 Almost 270 East Timorese who came to Australia under the temporary Safe Haven arrangements have returned home in the past week the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today.

 "Australians can be proud of our overall humanitarian and emergency response to the situation faced by the East Timorese," Mr Ruddock said.

 "In addition to the deployment of troops for peace keeping and the provision of humanitarian aid, we have provided temporary safe haven to about 16-hundred East Timorese, most of whom have now returned home to assist in the rebuilding of their nation.

 "Safe Haven was always provided on the understanding that people would return to East Timor when it was assessed safe for them to do so, and that time has come," Mr Ruddock said.

 The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) has provided assurances that it is safe for the East Timorese to return and some 128,000 Timorese have already returned to East Timor from around the region. East Timorese leaders, Xanana Gusmao and Jose Ramos Horta support the UNHCR and have also stated that it is time for the East Timorese to return.

 "We have encouraged those who are in a position to do so, to return home with their compatriots, but about 205 will remain in Australia for the time being, because they or someone in their immediate family are not ready for travel," Mr Ruddock said.

 Since Wednesday evening, four flights have left Sydney with 269 East Timorese from the East Hills Safe Haven on board. They connected with charter flights into Dili, arranged by the International Organization for Migration.

 On arrival, the East Timorese returning home are provided with an assistance package by the UNHCR to support them until they link in with aid agencies.
