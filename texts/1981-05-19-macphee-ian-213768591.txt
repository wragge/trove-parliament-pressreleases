 GRANT-IN-AID FOR LAO. REFUGEE. ASSOCIATION

 A grant of up to $50 000 over three years to the 

 Association of Lao Refugees in N.S.W. was announced today, by 

 the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee.

 The grant, made under the Commonwealth Grant-in-Aid 

 Scheme, will enable the Association to employ a social welfare 

 worker to deal with settlement and welfare difficulties faced 

 by Lao refugees in Fairfield-west of Sydney.

 Mr Macphee said that since. .1.97 5, nearly 5 000 Lao 

 refugees had come to Australia. Most of these had settled in 

 Sydney's western suburbs. ' r

 "Refugees have access to Australian community services, 

 but they often need additional settlement help.." Mr Macphee said

 "They often suffer from social isolation and emotional 

 trauma from their past experiences, as well as a lack of ability 

 to use the services available to them. The grant-in-aid 

 will help the people served to settle easily in the wider 

 Australian community." |
