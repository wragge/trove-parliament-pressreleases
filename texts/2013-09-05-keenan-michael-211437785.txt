 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling Over 5,000 illegal boat arrivals in less than 50  days under Rudd August 14, 2013

 Over 5,000 people have arrived by illegal boat in the less than 50 days since Kevin Rudd was reappointed Prime Minister,  following the latest illegal boat with 52 people on board.

 “More than 5,000 people have arrived on 64 boats since Kevin Rudd - the architect of Labor’s border chaos - resumed the  job and his failure less than 50 days ago,” Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said. 

 “This includes more than 2,300 people on 34 boats since Kevin Rudd announced his PNG election fix, barely 10% of  whom have actually been sent to Manus Island. 

 “More boat arrivals come as a senior Labor Senator today confirmed that Kevin Rudd’s PNG arrangement is just a political  fix to last until the election.”

 Labor Senator and former Tasmanian Labor Minister, Lin Thorp said she did not know anyone who was "completely  happy" with the PNG arrangement, saying:

 "I'm sure that any conversations in the party room, in the caucus room, post- election will be robust, and will lead to  changes in the future."

 “This is just the latest statement from a senior Labor Party figure criticising the PNG arrangement and shows yet again  that when it comes to border protection, Labor’s heart is just not in it,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “Labor have neither the resolve nor the competence to implement strong border protection policies to stop the boats and  end the cost, chaos and tragedy that have occurred on their watch.”

 Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said: "11 boats carrying 575 people have  arrived since Kevin Rudd announced the election date, proving once again that the people smugglers are still running their  daily ferry service to Australia.

 “The boats continue to arrive on our shores at a rapid rate and no amount of talk is going to change this while the Labor  Party is still in power.

 “This was a problem that had been solved by the Howard Government and it was only because of Kevin Rudd’s foolish  decision to abolish the Pacific Solution that the people smugglers went back into business.

 “The Coalition has a proven set of border protection policies that worked to stop the boats and will do so again.”
