 Regional students and universities need a competent  experienced minister for a change 

 

 The farce that the Gillard Labor Government has become is no laughing matter for  regional students and universities, as they have to wait in limbo for the Prime  Minister to appoint her third tertiary education minister since the beginning of the  term, according to Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Education, Senator  Fiona Nash. 

 “Regional universities and students can’t just grind to a halt while the Prime Minister  plays pick-up 52 with her ministers,” Senator Nash said. 

 “In Senator Evans we had a Minister seemingly bereft of interest or understanding of  regional education challenges; Chris Bowen was only there long enough to take a  breather from the caning he was getting over boat arrivals, and now we don’t have  any minister at all.” 

 “Only last week, the Regional Universities Network issued a carefully considered set  of policies for the Government to consider for their future, but there is no one home  in Canberra to read it - it is an absolute disgrace!” 

 “There are also large sums of unallocated funds from the Regional Education  Infrastructure Fund and the ongoing problems with unfair income support  provisions for regional students.” 

 “For a Prime Minister fond of boasting of her education credentials, this is  unbelievably shambolic.” 

 “Regional universities and students urgently need a competent experienced  minister," Senator Nash concluded.
