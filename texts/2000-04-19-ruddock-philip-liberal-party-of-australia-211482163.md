 New South Wales Settlement Plan 2000-2002 Launched MPS 040/2000

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today launched a plan designed to improve services to migrants in New South Wales, the state where most arrivals settle.

 Mr Ruddock, launching the New South Wales Settlement Plan 2000-2002 at the State Library of NSW, said the program was an opportunity for the three levels of government and the community to work together to better coordinate services for migrants to the state.

 "As NSW has the largest number of arrivals of any state in Australia - over 90,000 between 1996 and 1999 - it is vital that it has a plan for all levels of government to work together to achieve effective services for migrants," Mr Ruddock said.

 Since 1996, the majority of migrants in all categories settled in NSW. Overall, the state received 42.3 per cent of all migrants coming to Australia in the three years since 1996.

 Family stream arrivals represented that largest element of the total migration to NSW until 1998-99, when the number of skilled stream arrivals became the largest group, being 43.7 per cent of the intake for that year.

 The NSW Settlement Plan 2000-2002 offers a framework to improve strategic planning activities between government departments. It assists government to respond to changes such as those announced in the Migration Program 2000-2001.

 The NSW Interdepartmental Committee on Migrant Settlement (NICOMS) has designed the plan as a tool to assist in coordinating settlement services for migrants, refugees and other humanitarian entrants in NSW.

 It is the culmination of a process by NICOMS to develop a dynamic document that can incorporate new issues as they arise. It is the result of consultation between various Commonwealth and State agencies, as well as community representatives.

 The plan has focused on three key clients groups. These are refugee and other humanitarian entrants; recent arrivals with limited English language skills and groups with special needs; and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds for whom mainstream services are appropriate.

 The document is built on the principles of cultural diversity and reinforces the importance of those principles in the future planning of services for migrants in NSW.
