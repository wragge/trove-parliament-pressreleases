 MEDIA RELEASE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER          31  January  2006  

 

 AUSTRALIA BOOSTS AID FOR PEACE AND DEMOCRACY IN  AFGHANISTAN   

 The Australian Government, through its international aid agency, AusAID, will commit up to  $150 million over the next five years to support Afghanistan in its transition from conflict to  peace and democracy.   

 The funding will be used to make the country more secure, remove remaining terrorist threats,  rebuild government institutions, protect human rights and deliver critical health and education  services. As well as improving the lives of Afghan people this funding will contribute to  building national, regional and global peace and security.   

 This new commitment comes as I have joined world leaders gathered in London for the  signing of an Afghanistan Compact which provides a road-map for international donors and  the Government of Afghanistan to work together to rebuild the country into a stable and  democratic state.   

 Australia’s new pledge supports the goals of this Afghanistan Compact and builds on the  $110 million we have spent since September 2001 on projects which have helped to stage  democratic Presidential and Parliamentary elections, re-establish law and order and provide  essential food security, health and education services.   

 For example, Australia’s aid has supported the provision of surgical, obstetric and paediatric  hospital services to 50 health clinics in urban, regional and provincial areas. We have also  provided refugees with shelter and water assistance as well as support for their return,  reintegration and protection through the United Nations.   

 Australia has also previously committed around 300 military personnel and two helicopters to  Afghanistan, and is willing to consider contributing up to 200 further personnel for Provincial  Reconstruction Team activities.   

 This new pledge includes a budget commitment of $55 million up to the end of June 2007,  with additional funding after that date depending upon the ability of the Government of  Afghanistan to perform against benchmarks contained in the Afghanistan Compact.   

 Australia’s commitment at this London Conference demonstrates our continued support to the  Afghan people and their Government as they work towards realising their aspirations for  peace, stability and democracy.
