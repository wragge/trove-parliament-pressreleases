 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Scott Morrison 

 Minister must answer questions over alleged assault by asylum seekers 

 Friday 10th May 2013 

 Two Sri Lankan men arrested for the alleged indecent assault of women in Sydney on Thursday night were 

 reportedly on bridging visas having arrived in Australia illegally by boat, once again raising serious 

 questions the Minister for Immigration, Brendan O’Connor must urgently answer about his community 

 dumping policy for asylum seekers on bridging visas who have arrived illegally by boat, Shadow Minister 

 for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today.  

 

 “This further distressing incident follows an earlier incident in February this year and is one that Brendan 

 O’Connor must urgently address,” Mr Morrison said.  

 

 “Today the Minister must first confirm whether the individuals who are subject to these charges were 

 asylum seekers on bridging visas as reported by NSW Police.  

 

 “Minister O’Connor must then answer:  

 â¢ whether the men have been taken back into detention and have had their bridging visas revoked pending 

 their trial and if not why not;  

 â¢ how often the Department of Immigration or any service providers on their behalf had made contact with 

 the two men and the last time that contact was made;  

 â¢ whether his Department had a current residential address for the two men arrested and whether they 

 were still living in accommodation provided under the Department of Immigration’s Community Assistance 

 Support (CAS) program.  

 

 “Minister O’Connor must also detail what actions he took after an asylum seeker on a bridging visa was 

 charged for an alleged assault in February to prevent such incidents re-occurring, other than dismissing the 

 incident and attacking the Coalition for raising the alarm.  

 

 “The previous incident was an important warning signal about the lack of protocols and guidelines for this 

 programme. At the time the Coalition was attacked for demanding an urgent review of the scheme to 

 ensure safeguards were put in place, not just for the sake of community, but also to ensure proper 

 safeguards for those, now including children, who are subject to this programme and can be highly 

 vulnerable in the community.  

 

 “Minister O’Connor flatly rejected our calls for a review of the scheme, for reporting requirements for 

 bridging visa holders to be put in place, for a behaviour code to be established for those released into the 

 community and for appropriate accommodation standards to be developed, just to name a few 

 suggestions.  

 

 “Labor are dumping people into the community because they have been overwhelmed by their own border 

 failures with no thought for the consequences.  

 

 “Labor’s community dumping policy is irresponsible and has resulted in asylum seekers being charged with 

 serious offences, left them living in squalid conditions around the country and forced them to rely on 

 already stretched charitable service providers.  

 

 “Brendan O’Connor can’t wash his hands of this latest incident. He must get out from under his desk and 

 take some responsibility for his policy failures,” Mr Morrison said.
