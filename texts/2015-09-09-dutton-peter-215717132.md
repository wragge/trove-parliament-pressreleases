 JOINT PRESS RELEASE   

 

 THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MP, PRIME MINISTER  THE HON. JULIE BISHOP MP, MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  THE HON. PETER DUTTON MP,   MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION  THE HON. SCOTT MORRISON MP, MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SERVICES 

 

 THE SYRIAN AND IRAQI HUMANITARIAN CRISIS   

 Australia will resettle an additional 12,000 refugees who are fleeing the conflict in Syria and Iraq.   

 Our focus will be on those most in need - the women, children and families of persecuted minorities who  have sought refuge from the conflict in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.   

 A team of Government officials will depart for the region as soon as possible to begin identifying and  processing potential candidates for resettlement.   

 In addition, Australia will provide humanitarian support to more than 240,000 Syrian and Iraqi people who  have been forced to flee their homes or seek refuge in neighbouring countries. This is expected to cost $44  million.     

 This funding will deliver much needed food, water, healthcare, education, emergency supplies and  protection, including support for women and girls.   

 With this additional commitment, Australia’s contribution to help address the humanitarian crisis in Syria  and Iraq will be around $230 million since 2011.   

 Today’s announcement represents a significant contribution to the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East.  It  is a generous, prudent and proportionate response by a decent and compassionate nation.    

 It follows consultations with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian  agencies in Geneva.   

 Our officials will work with the UNHCR to resettle the refugees as soon as possible.   

 They will undergo normal security, health and character checks before coming to Australia and receiving  permanent protection.   

 The 12,000 places will be in addition to the existing humanitarian programme of 13,750, which rises to  18,750 in 2018-19.

 This decision represents a significant increase in Australia’s humanitarian intake.     

 We are able to make this contribution because the Coalition Government has stopped the flow of illegal  boats to Australia, easing the pressure on our humanitarian programme.   

 It will require the support of all Australian governments and community organisations.   

 We will engage State and Territory leaders and community organisations in coming days to discuss how the  nation can contribute to this effort.
