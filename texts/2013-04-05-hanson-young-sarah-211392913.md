 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 5 April 2013   

 Offshore centres must be closed as asylum  policy continues to harm  Sarah Hanson-Young   

 Criticism of the Manus Island detention centre from a member of the government’s own expert  panel on asylum seekers shows that Labor’s unravelling Pacific Solution needs to be shut down  immediately and children and families need to be brought to the mainland.   

 “Labor’s policy of offshore detention is hanging in tatters and it’s clear that these island prisons  need to be shut down,” the Greens immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young  said.   

 “Children do not belong in detention.   

 “The government’s practice of implementing only the harsh and cruel policies from the Houston  Panel’s recommendations without proper oversight or care shows that they have lost their way.   

 “Detention on Manus Island is making people sick, it is dangerous.   

 “The Government needs to listen to the chorus of criticism regarding their offshore detention  policy.   

 “We need an interim report into the implementation of the Houston Panel’s recommendations  and we need to get back to more humane, practical and cheaper refugee policies.   

 “Offshore detention and the senseless ‘no advantage’ test are not stopping the boats and,  tragically, not stopping the loss of life at sea.”
