 ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW TRIBUNAL BILL INTRODUCED

 I am pleased to announce today the introduction of legislation to establish the Administrative Review Tribunal. This is the most significant reform of the Federal merits review system in the past 25 years.

 The ART will review administrative decisions on their merits. It will replace the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. The six divisions of the new tribunal will reflect the jurisdictions of the tribunals being replaced.

 The ART will be headed by a President, assisted by executive members to run the divisions. There will also be senior members and members.

 A vast number of decisions made by government departments and agencies on a daily basis affect the rights and interests of individuals. The Government is committed to ensuring that people have ready access to independent and high quality review of decisions that is inexpensive, prompt, informal and effective. The creation of a single, independent tribunal will streamline and improve merits review, removing duplication and current inefficiencies.

 The new tribunal will be flexible and accessible. It will provide review that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. Where appropriate, the tribunal will review decisions in a non-adversarial way and use a variety of processes to resolve issues, including conferences, inquiries and informal hearings. It will also use video and telephone conferencing to help to give all Australians access to the tribunal, including those in rural and remote areas.

 The Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2000 will establish the ART and provide for its structure, membership and procedures. The ART (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill will confer jurisdiction on the ART. That Bill is not yet finalised. I have decided to introduce the main ART Bill now and the Consequential and Transitional Provisions Bill in the next parliamentary sittings, so that scrutiny of the ART Bill can commence immediately.

 Subject to the passage of the ART Bill and the Consequential and Transitional Provisions Bill through the Parliament, I hope that key staff will be appointed before the end of this year. The Government’s goal is to have the ART operational early in 2001.

 The Administrative Review Council will continue under the ART legislation, providing valuable expert advice to the Government on matters relating to the Commonwealth system of administrative review.
