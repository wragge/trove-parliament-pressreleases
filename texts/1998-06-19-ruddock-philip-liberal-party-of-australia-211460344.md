  MEDIA RELEASE

  

  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

  The Hon. Philip Ruddock MP 

  

  Contract signed for English language tuition in ACT

  

  MPS 69/98 

  

  Migrants will have access to more flexible and effective English language 
tuition in the ACT  following the signing of a new contract for 
the delivery of the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP), the Minister 
for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, announced 
today. 

  

 The five year, $5 million 
contract, between the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 
and the successful tenderer, the Canberra Institute of Technology, was 
signed today at a special ceremony at Old Parliament House, Canberra. 

  

 Mr Ruddock said English 
language ability is one of the key factors in the successful settlement 
of migrants into the Australian community. 

  

 "Studies have shown 
that migrants with a low level of English language skill tend to have 
a poor employment experience and can face social isolation." 

  

 "The new AMEP service 
delivery arrangements will provide better services for ACT clients including 
more flexibility in service delivery options and better pathways to 
further study or employment." 

  

 The ceremony also marked 
the achievement of an important milestone in the history of the AMEP 
in Canberra - the program's 50th Anniversary. 

  

 "It is fitting 
the celebrations are being held in Old Parliament House, as it is where 
Australia's post-war migration program began and where the Adult Migrant 
English Program was born," Mr Ruddock said. 

  

 "Since it began 
in 1948, the program has assisted about 1.5 million migrants and refugees 
settle in the Australian community." 

  

 "The AMEP provides 
nine million hours of English language tuition a year, and in 1997, 
it assisted 39,000 clients from 89 language backgrounds." 

  

 "It is acknowledged 
as a world-leading language program and is one of Australia's key migrant 
settlement services." 

  

 "The AMEP has made 
a major contribution to the successful settlement of non-English speaking 
migrants and refugees and the maximisation of Australia's cultural diversity".
