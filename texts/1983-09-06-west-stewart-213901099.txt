 From the Minister for Immigration-  and Ethnic Affairs.  he Hon Stewart West MP

 71/83

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Stewart  West, yesterday met with representatives of the New South  Wales Committee of Solidarity with Hunger Strikers in Turkey.

 "I abhor violations of human rights in any country, under  any regime" Mr West told the Committee.

 "But I also oppose the use of hunger striking as a weapon  to influence Government policy"..

 Mr West urged the Committee to persuade the hunger strikers  to use other means of drawing attention to their demands.

 Mr West said that Australia's migration program provided a  basis for a broad response to the needs of people wishing  to migrate to Australia.

 "The Government's Family Reunion Program, Refugee Policy and  Special Humanitarian Program are avenues open to people who,  for a variety of reasons, wish to, and are eligible to, come  to Australia" Mr West said.

 "Any requests for consideration of refugee status, from people  living outside their own country, would be dealt with under  established procedures".

 Mr West repeated to the Committee his previous public statement  that the Australian Government was opposed to. any pressure  being brought to bear on persons residing in Australia by  foreign Governments.

 "The Australian Labor Government does, not·*t'olerate such  interference with people residing in Australia" Mr West said. \  : '  . 

 "I have stated this before, and my position, and that of the Government, has not changed".
