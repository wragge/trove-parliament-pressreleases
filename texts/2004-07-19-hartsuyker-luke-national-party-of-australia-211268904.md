 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 

 July 19, 2004 

 

 Coffs Harbour and Yamba Ports a part of new  Customs waterfront CCTV network   

 The Coffs Harbour marina area and the Port of Yamba are two of 31 regional ports  that will now be connected to Customs national waterfront closed circuit TV network,  Federal Member for Cowper, Luke Hartsuyker said today.   

 Under new measures announced by the Prime Minister, John Howard, activities at  the port will be monitored by Customs around the clock without the need for a  physical presence, significantly increasing border security.   

 “Australia has a vast coastline with many ports and protecting our borders is a huge  task. To tackle this challenge, Customs has already connected 32 ports nationally to  its waterfront CCTV network,” Mr Hartsuyker said.   

 “This will be now be expanded to 63 ports and I am delighted that Coffs Harbour and  Yamba will be part of an extended network.”   

 The existing national network consists of more than 220 cameras at 95 wharf areas.   All the cameras are linked to local Customs Houses, Regional Monitoring Centres in  each state, and the National Monitoring Centre in Melbourne.   

 “Customs is Australia’s key frontline border protection agency and this new funding  will enable them to provide an even higher level of protection for Australia against  illicit drugs, illegal arrivals, disease and other threats to the nation’s welfare.”   

 In addition, an increase in operating hours at container examination facilities across  Australia will allow Customs to boost the number of containers x-rayed from 80,000  to 100,000 per year.  All containers are screened by Customs before arrival in  Australia, and Australia’s x-ray inspection rate of 7 per cent of sea cargo imports  means we are a world leader, putting us right up there with the US and ahead of  other countries.   

 Mr Hartsuyker  said the funding announced today, $17 million over four years  represented a virtual doubling of Customs ability to remotely monitor border activity  at Australian ports 24-hours a day, 365-days of the year.

 Automated video motion detection makes sure that activity on the waterfront, no  matter what time of the day or night, can be targeted and monitored.   

 “This greatly enhanced surveillance network will provide comprehensive monitoring  of Australia’s waterfront and deliver enhanced security to both Coffs harbour and  Yamba,” Mr Hartsuyker said. 

 

 Customs Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) system is acknowledged as a world leader in its  field.   

 “No other country has achieved the coverage Australia has through the linking of all  of its major international sea ports,” Mr Hartsuyker said.   

 “This solid commitment to border protection shows that the Howard Government will  not rest in ensuring that Australia’s borders are secure and protected against illegal  activity and the threat of terrorism,” Mr Hartsuyker said.
