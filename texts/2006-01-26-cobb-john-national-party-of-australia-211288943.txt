  Queensland Welcomes Over 4000 New Aussies 

 26 January 2006 

 More than 4000 people will become Australian citizens in more than 80  ceremonies across Queensland on Australia Day, the Australian Government  Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, John Cobb, said today. 

 ‘A record number of 14 000 people will become Australian citizens at ceremonies  around the country this Australia Day,’ Mr Cobb said. 

 ‘Over 600 conferees will attend a ceremony at the Brisbane Town Hall. They  come from more than 63 countries, including Belarus, Guatemala, Macau,  Portugal and the Russian Federation,’ the Minister said.  

 In a Gold Coast ceremony, New Zealand-born and prominent radio host Richard  Fowler will be joining the Australian family. 

 Pacifique Gakindi, who is the President of the Rwandan Association is also being  conferred today. Pacifique, his wife and four children are refugees from Rwanda  and will participate in the Lions Club of Moorooka citizenship ceremony.  Coincidentally, his youngest son born in Australia, and an Australian citizen,  celebrates his first birthday on Australia Day. 

 ‘There was no future in my country for my children. There was no justice in my  old country. Here I can enjoy justice, freedom and democracy which is missing  in Africa,’ Mr Gakindi said. 

 Mr Gakindi’s family will be taking citizenship alongside Lyn Ellison from the UK,  who happens to live in the same street and also assists new migrants to settle in  Australia. 

 ‘The Queensland conferees join the 3.5 million people who have become citizens  since Australian citizenship was introduced more than 55 years ago. 

 ‘I am delighted that so many people around the nation will become Australian  citizens on this national day of celebration and I warmly welcome them to the  Australian family. 

 ‘Citizenship is the unifying force in our culturally diverse society and I encourage  those who are eligible to take the step and become a citizen,’ Mr Cobb added.
