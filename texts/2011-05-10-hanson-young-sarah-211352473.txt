 Greens move a Senate motion condemning  Malaysian solution   

 The Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young has today tabled a motion against  the Gillard government’s plan to send 800 asylum seekers to Malaysia in exchange for 4,000 assessed  refugees being sent to Australia. 

 The motion, which will be debated and voted during Wednesday afternoon, states: 

 That the Senate condemns the Gillard Government's deal with Malaysia that would see 800 asylum  seekers intercepted in Australian waters and sent to Malaysian detention camps; and calls on the  Government to immediately abandon this proposal.
