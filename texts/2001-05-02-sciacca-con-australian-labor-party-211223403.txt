 Labor Welcomes Former PM's Calls For A Judicial Inquiry Con Sciacca - Shadow Minister for Immigration

 Media Statement - 2 May 2001

 Federal Labor today welcomed calls by former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser for a judicial inquiry into the management of Australia's immigration detention centres.

 Shadow Minister for Immigration Con Sciacca said that Labor had been calling for such an inquiry since allegations of abuse and mistreatment of asylum seekers, as well as general mismanagement of detention centres, surfaced late last year.

 "Since last November Labor has constantly called for a full independent judicial inquiry into the management and operation of Australia's immigration detention centres, so I certainly welcome Mr Fraser's contribution to the debate," Mr Sciacca said.

 "It is significant that a former Liberal Prime Minister should be so at odds with the current Minister for Immigration. It is further proof that the Howard Government is tearing itself apart and has lost support even from its formerleader.

 "While Federal Labor maintains a bipartisan policy on compulsory detention of asylum seekers to ensure that they do not constitute a health and character risk, an independent judicial inquiry is needed to investigate the many issues raised by credible witnesses and by reports from both the Commonwealth Ombudsman and Mr Philip Flood.

 "Only such an inquiry can test the veracity of the many allegations made and restore public confidence in the management of Australia's immigration detention centres.

 "I take this opportunity to again call for a full, independent judicial inquiry -- with powers to compel testimony, protect witnesses and subpoena evidence -- into the serious allegations that have been made by credible witnesses and, into the management practices of Australasian Correctional Management in Australia's immigration detention centres," Mr Sciacca said. Authorised by Geoff Walsh, 19 National Circuit, Barton ACT 2600.
