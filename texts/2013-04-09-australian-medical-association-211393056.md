 PRISONERS AND DETAINEES HAVE A RIGHT TO HUMANE  TREATMENT  AMA Position Statement on Medical Ethics in Custodial Settings   

 The AMA today released its Position Statement on Medical Ethics in Custodial Settings .   

 The Position Statement details the AMA position that prisoners and detainees in custodial  settings have a right to humane treatment, regardless of the reasons for their imprisonment, and  should be treated with respect for their human dignity and privacy.   

 AMA President, Dr Steve Hambleton, said that prisoners and detainees should have the same  right of access, equity, and quality of health care as the general population.   

 “Medical practitioners must have complete clinical independence in deciding upon the care of  a prisoner or detainee for whom she or he is medically responsible,” Dr Hambleton said.   

 “The doctor’s fundamental role is to alleviate the distress of his or her fellow human beings,  and no motive - whether personal, collective, or political - should prevail against this role.   

 “Participation in any form of torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading procedure is incompatible  with the doctor’s role as healer.”   

 The Position Statement addresses other issues including:  â¢ the role of treating and non-treating doctors in the custodial setting;  â¢ consent and confidentiality;  â¢ body cavity searches;  â¢ hunger strikes;  â¢ solitary confinement;  â¢ restraints;  â¢ medical research;  â¢ speaking out; and  â¢ capital punishment.

 Medical Ethics in Custodial Settings    

 2013    

 1. Preamble    

 1.1 Prisoners and detainees have a right to humane treatment, regardless of the reasons  for their imprisonment, and should be treated with respect for their human dignity and  privacy. They should never be denied treatment on the basis of their culture,  ethnicity, religion, political beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, the nature of their  illness, the reason for their incarceration, or their criminal history.   

 1.2 In accordance with the World Medical Association, doctors (medical practitioners)  must have complete clinical independence in deciding upon the care of a prisoner or  detainee for whom he or she is medically responsible. The doctor’s fundamental role  is to alleviate the distress of his or her fellow human beings, and no motive, whether  personal, collective or political, should prevail against this. Participation in any form of  torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading procedure is incompatible with the doctor’s  role as healer. 1    

 1.3 Prisoners and detainees have the same right of access, equity, and quality of health  care as the general population. This includes the coordinated and continuous health  care from a person’s first point of contact with the criminal justice system through to  successful reintegration into the community. This also includes continuity of care if a  prisoner or detainee is transferred from one custodial setting to another. 2    

 1.4 Governments and prison authorities have a duty of care to all prisoners and  detainees under their control, including those in private correctional facilities.  Governments must provide basic humane standards and should strive to achieve  world’s best practice in all Australian correctional facilities including police custody,  prison, juvenile detention centres, and other custodial settings. Correctional facilities  should accommodate the language, cultural, and religious needs of prisoners and  detainees.   

 1.5 This position statement highlights important ethical challenges faced by doctors  working with prisoners and detainees in custodial settings. It should be read in  conjunction with the AMA’s Position Statement on Health and the Criminal Justice  System 2012.  i   

 2. Professional autonomy and clinical independence    

 2.1 The primary duty of doctors working in custodial settings is to serve the health needs  of prisoners and detainees. In order to fulfill this duty, doctors require reasonable  professional autonomy and clinical independence without undue influence from  correctional facility management.

 3  At times, the doctor’s primary duty may conflict 

 with the priorities of the corrections authorities to enforce prison rules and  regulations. 4  Corrections authorities should afford doctors the freedom to exercise  their professional judgment in the care and treatment of their patients.  

 

 i  For the purposes of this position statement, ‘detainee’ refers to a person detained in a custodial setting, not  in immigration detention. For AMA policy on health care of ‘detainees’ in immigration detention, please  refer to the Position Statement on Health Care of Asylum Seekers and Refugees 2011.

 2.2 Corrections facilities must provide appropriate medical facilities and resources to care  for the health needs of prisoners and detainees.   

 2.3 Corrections facilities should provide adequate protection and security for doctors and  other health care personnel working in custodial settings.    

 3. Treating doctors and non-treating doctors    

 3.1 Doctors working in custodial settings may serve as treating doctors or non-treating  doctors. The treating doctor has a therapeutic relationship with the prisoner or  detainee. The treating doctor’s role is to examine, treat, and manage the health  needs of their patients (prisoners and detainees) while respecting the confidentiality  of information obtained in the course of the therapeutic relationship.   

 3.2 The non-treating doctor does not have a therapeutic relationship with the prisoner or  detainee. A non-treating doctor may be asked to conduct an independent medical  assessment to assess the prisoner or detainee on behalf of a third party such as the  corrections administration. 5 An independent medical assessment may be conducted  for a variety of reasons such as assessing a prisoner or detainee’s ability to work in  the corrections facility. A non-treating doctor may also be asked to conduct a medical  examination for judicial, evidentiary, or security purposes.    

 3.3 Non-treating doctors engaged to perform an independent medical assessment or a  medical examination for judicial, evidentiary, or security processes have an obligation  to ensure the prisoner or detainee understands the purpose of the examination and  its implications and has consented to the examination. The doctor should explain the  limits of privacy and confidentiality that may occur in relation to such an examination  and provide an objective, impartial opinion.   

 3.4 Both treating doctors and non-treating doctors working within custodial settings must  adhere to the principles of medical professionalism. 6   

 

 4. Consent and confidentiality    

 4.1 Like all patients in the general community, consent should be sought from prisoners  before undertaking any examination, diagnosis, or treatment unless the patient does  not have decision-making capacity and requires surrogate consent or the situation is  an emergency.    

 4.2 Trust is an essential component of any doctor-patient relationship. Confidentiality of  health information should generally be maintained unless the individual consents to  disclosure of that information. There may be certain circumstances where disclosure  in the absence of consent is appropriate; for example, where non-disclosure poses a  serious harm to others or where required by law.    

 4.3 Effective information management systems and other coordinating mechanisms  should be instituted to enable a person’s continuity of care (eg., from prison to prison  and from prison to the community). 2

 5. Body cavity searches    

 5.1 Body cavity searches for the sole purpose of obtaining evidence or to retrieve  substances for evidentiary purposes are not medical acts and should not be  undertaken by doctors.   

 5.2 Body cavity searches for medical purposes should be performed by doctors only.  Generally, the person’s consent should be obtained before such a search can be  undertaken. Doctors may perform body cavity searches on individuals who are  unable to consent (due to impaired capacity), only when the life of the person is likely  to be endangered.   

 5.3 Where possible, a doctor from outside the correctional facility should perform body  cavity searches.   

 6. Hunger strikes ii  

 

 6.1 Doctors should respect a competent individual’s decision to enter into a hunger  strike. Doctors should continue to provide care to the individual while respecting their  voluntary refusal of nourishment.    

 6.2 Where a prisoner or detainee refuses nourishment and is considered by the doctor to  be capable of forming an unimpaired and rational judgement concerning the  consequences of such a voluntary refusal of nourishment, the doctor should refuse to  co-operate in artificial feeding. Forced feeding contrary to an informed and voluntary  refusal is not justifiable. Artificial feeding with the hunger striker’s explicit or implied  consent is ethically acceptable.    

 6.3 The decision as to the capacity of the prisoner or detainee to form such a judgement  should be confirmed by at least one other independent doctor. The doctors must  explain to the person the consequences of the refusal of nourishment, ensuring the  person fully understands the information. The doctors should be confident the person  is entering into a hunger strike voluntarily.     

 6.4 Doctors should not apply any undue pressure on the person to suspend their hunger  strike. Treatment or care of the individual must not be contingent on them suspending  their hunger strike.    

 6.5 Doctors should communicate with a hunger striker on a daily basis to clarify whether  the individual wishes to continue with the strike and what they would like to be done if  he/she loses decision-making capacity. Advance refusals of treatment should be  respected if they reflect the voluntary decision of the person when competent.    

 6.6 Where a doctor conscientiously objects to a hunger striker’s refusal of treatment, the  doctor should make this clear to the person at the outset and refer the hunger striker  to another doctor who is willing to abide by the refusal.

 7. Solitary confinement and protective custody    

 7.1 Solitary confinement, where a prisoner or detainee is confined separately from other  prisoners or detainees as a means of punishment, is inhumane. Solitary confinement  is medically harmful as it may lead to a number of physical and/or mental disorders.   

 7.2 A prisoner or detainee may need to enter protective custody if at risk of self-harm or  of harm by other prisoners or detainees. A prisoner or detainee with a blood-borne or  sexually transmitted infection may need to be separated for infection control.  Prisoners and detainees should not be separated without adequate access to health  care and appropriate medical treatment for any medical condition.    

 7.3 Correctional facilities should be designed so that prisoners and detainees requiring  protective custody can be separated from others in an environment similar to that of  the other prisoners and detainees.   

 7.4 Where a prisoner or detainee in protective custody is isolated from others, the person  should be provided opportunities to have regular contact with people outside the  correctional facility, either face-to-face or by telephone.   

 8. Physical and chemical restraints    

 8.1 The use of force, physical, or chemical restraint solely for non-medical purposes is  not a medical act and doctors should not be involved in imposing such restraints.   

 8.2 Medical personnel should never proceed with medical acts on restrained people,  except for those with potential for immediate and serious risk for themselves and  others. 4  

 

 

 9. Torture, cruel, or inhumane treatment iii  

 

 9.1 Doctors must not countenance, condone, or participate in the practice of torture or  other forms of cruel, inhumane or degrading procedures, whatever the offense of  which the victim of such procedures is suspected, accused or guilty, and whatever  the person’s beliefs or motives, and in all situations, including armed conflict and civil  strife.   

 9.2 Doctors must not provide any premises, instruments, substances, or knowledge to  facilitate the practice of torture or other forms of cruel, inhumane or degrading  treatment or to diminish the ability of the victim to resist such treatment. Doctors  should not use nor allow to be used medical knowledge or skills specific to an  individual, to facilitate or aid an interrogation.    

 9.3 Doctors should not be present during any procedure during which torture or any other  forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is used or threatened.

 10. Medical research     

 10.1 Doctors must abstain from participating in any form of research involving prisoners  and/or detainees without prior ethics approval and adherence to research protocols  developed by organisations such as the National Health and Medical Research  Council.    

 11. Speaking out    

 11.1 Doctors have a duty to speak out to appropriate authorities when the health care  services or environment within correctional facilities are inadequate or pose a  potential threat to health.   

 11.2 Doctors should try to prevent coercion or maltreatment of prisoners and detainees  and should speak out if such actions occur.   

 

 12. Capital punishment    

 12.1  Doctors must not participate in capital punishment in any way, including facilitating  the importation or prescription of drugs for execution, planning, instructing, and/or  training of other persons to perform executions. 7
