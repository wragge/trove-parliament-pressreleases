 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR,  JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH HIS EXCELLENCY THE HON. MARCUS  STEPHEN MP, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF NAURU  NAURU   

 

 E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………   

 PRESIDENT MARCUS STEPHEN:   

 Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Nauru. I trust you had an enjoyable day-and-a-half in our country and  I hope that with the visit here you will see that Nauru is a lovely place and a place where it’s very friendly  with friendly people. Just on those words, again, welcome and I look forward to questions that you wish to  raise from our meeting.    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I’d just like to say what a pleasure it has been to be on Nauru for the last 36 hours and what an honour it has  been to be received so hospitably by His Excellency, President Stephen and his team. Obviously, the main  purpose of my visit, along with Scott Morrison, has been to canvas the possible reintroduction of a  processing centre here for boat people who come to Australia. I think that it’s pretty obvious from the  discussions that I have had with the Nauruan Government that they stand ready to assist Australia should the  Australian Government believe that this will be helpful. Perhaps the strongest message that I’ve had from  the Nauruan Government and people is their deep goodwill towards Australia and it really is encouraging  and gratifying to find another country, particularly a neighbouring country, which has this very strong bond  of affection and understanding of Australia. So, I really appreciate the warmth that the Nauruan Government  and its people have displayed towards me and Scott as, in our own way, representatives of the Australian  people.    

 I think that reopening the processing centre here at Nauru makes a lot of sense. I don’t want to get into  heavy duty party politics here with the President and Foreign Minister of Nauru but I think it makes a lot  more sense than the Malaysian people swap that is currently proposed. I think that compared to Malaysia,  reopening the processing centre here at Nauru is more humane, more cost-effective and certainly it’s proven  in the context of the Howard Government’s range of policies that did effectively stop the boats some years  ago.    

 Finally, I’d like to say that we did, Scott and I, canvas with the President, the Foreign Minister and the other  senior members of the Nauruan Government the possibility of Nauru signing and ratifying the UN Refugee  Convention. I think it would be welcome from our perspective if Nauru did ratify the convention and my

 understanding is that the Nauruan Government’s processes have been underway and that the ratification of  the Convention is imminent by the Nauruan Government.   

 So, finally, if I could again say just what an honour it is to have been here, to have been so well-received by  the Nauruan Government and people. I really have deeply appreciated the warmth of the welcome and I look  forward to coming back to Nauru again, hopefully perhaps in a more senior capacity.    

 Questions?   

 QUESTION:   

 If you’re going to be in government and the reopening of the Nauru processing centre is passed, are you  willing to build a new school for the students there, because students are currently attending there and one  other thing, if it’s more than 500 refugees, how about the rehab, will they be relocated?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, obviously, one of the unavoidable costs of reopening the centre at State House would be relocating  the primary school which is currently housed there. That would be one of the unavoidable costs. Now, this is  a project that could usefully be considered by the Australian Government anyway. There are a number of  projects which the Nauruan Government has in mind which are currently subject to applications for AusAid  funding and this is something that may well be part of that. As for the numbers, well, the State House centre  did cater for about 500 people. In the time of the Howard Government, there was a much larger camp at  Topside. Let’s see what happens. I mean, my confident expectation would be that a reopening of the  processing centre at Nauru, coupled with the reintroduction of temporary protection visas, would stop the  boats. So, let’s see how many boat people that would ultimately be necessary to house here in Nauru, but  certainly if it was necessary to reopen the Topside camp, a) that would take a little longer and b) that would  have some implications for the rehabilitation work. But, nevertheless, I’m confident that it would be a  deferral and not a destruction of that work.   

 QUESTION:   

 And so you would look to refurbish those camps rather than find and source new camps on the island?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well look, the physical infrastructure remains sound, certainly at the State House camp. Yes, there are some  broken windows. Yes, there’s been a little bit of decay. But the physical infrastructure remains sound. All it  would need to bring it back to action would be a coat of paint, some serious emergency gardening work,  some new windows and some new air conditioners. But apart from that, the basic infrastructure is there.    

 QUESTION:   

 But who owns that land at the moment? Is that something that needs to be considered? Was it handed back  to the government? Is it privately owned? Isn’t it more complex than just a coat of paint, is what I’m asking?   

 PRESIDENT MARCUS STEPHEN:   

 We do have a Lands Act. You must appreciate, also, that all land belongs to landowners here. Under the  Lands Act we’re allowed to lease land. Currently they are under lease to government and it’s still ongoing,  we’ve got another 20 year lease, it’s the standard lease we have.    

 QUESTION:    

 3 

 

 How confident are you, Mr President, in the support of the Nauruan people for more detention centres here  or reopening detention centres here?   

 PRESIDENT MARCUS STEPHEN:   

 Based on what we had in the past, the centre here was not a hindrance to the people. It was received openly,  it was welcomed. It was good to have on the island. Those people running the centres then, they just went  about their job while we did our job. Sometimes we didn’t even know that they were there, so basically the  people welcomed it and of course the Government at that time also welcomed it.    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Could I just make the point, Leo, that it’s a processing centre, not a detention centre as such, and one of the  points which has been well canvassed in the discussions with the Nauruan Government is that this would be  an open centre. There would be no barbed wire, there would be no locking people up as a matter of course. It  would be an open centre and people would have the run of the island as they did for most of the time under  the former government.   

 QUESTION:   

 The rest of the infrastructure around the island and everything is there to cater for the processing centre.  What is it that Nauru lacks that the Government of Australia has to bypass its reopening?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well I don’t think there’s anything that Nauru lacks. I think that as my tour of the island yesterday made  pretty clear, the boat people’s sense of Nauru would be well-housed, well-taught, well-protected if necessary  and well looked after if they were sick because facilities exist on the island. When the processing centres  were first established there were issues with power and water. The power and water situation is much, much  better now than it was ten years ago. In fact, the general condition of the island is far superior now then ten  years ago, thanks to the good work of successive Nauruan governments. So, I don’t think there’s any reason  why the processing centre can’t be reopened. I think there has been a reluctance by the current Australian  Government to act in ways which might be seen as reminiscent of the former Australian Government. I think  that there have been political factors in Australia rather than any infrastructure factors in Nauru that have  thus far prevented the Australian Government from formally approaching Nauru to reopen the centre but  given the difficulties that the Government is having with some of its other proposed options for dealing with  the boat situation, I certainly don’t think it’s impossible that the Government would finally accept that  Nauru is best and pick up the phone.   

 QUESTION:   

 President Stephen, the issue of recompense to landowners was raised. Would Nauru be looking at a financial  package in the future, if it was approached to open a processing centre again, if you’re looking at  recompense to landowners and building a new school and moving to a new school, what sort of dollar figure  would you put on sort of package?   

 PRESIDENT MARCUS STEPHEN:   

 To the first question about landowners being compensated, it’s like I mentioned earlier, we have a Lands Act  and that sets out the consistency, in terms of the compensation per hectare, you pay so much an amount. We  don’t have over and above because that would create problems for us; that means other landowners are  saying ‘well, if they’re getting more, why not us?’ So, we try to be consistent on that issue.  In terms of other major package as you call it, really, if you compare 2001 to today, we have most major  infrastructure in place. We feel that really there is not much else that we would be asking of Australia. We 

 4 

 

 have tremendous aid assistance through AusAid currently in place and over the last decade. We take the view  also that Australia, with our historical ties, we have a very good relationship. We do owe a debt of gratitude  to Australia and that’s why we’ve always said that if Australia asks for our assistance, we’re happy to help.  We’re not desperate. Things have really stabilised in our country now and we’re just happy to be part of the  solution if Nauru is any solution. So, we won’t be asking for much. I mean, we’re happy to help out  Australia if asked.    

 QUESTION:   

 Can I clarify one point under the Lands Act? You said there’s a lease already in place and so that is  providing the compensation. You wouldn’t have to go back to the landowners and say ‘we’re changing what  we’re going to use it for so we need to renegotiate the lease’?   

 PRESIDENT MARCUS STEPHEN:   

 That’s currently our law, so there’s not really much we can do about it apart from just applying the law. If  there are to be changes, then Parliament needs to change that law. So, currently we have certain fixed rates  on the lands.    

 QUESTION:   

 I’ve got one more question. What are you going to say to the Australian Parliament and people about your  trip to convince them that Nauru is a good place to reopen?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well I think that I’ve been saying quite a bit already and I think the words of the President today will be  very encouraging to the Australian people because Australians ought to be gratified to know that there is a  country in the Pacific that is as willing to help as Nauru is. It really is a sign of the deep reservoir of  goodwill by Nauruans for Australia that this is the case. So look, I will go back to the Australian Parliament.  I will let them know what I’ve seen and what I’ve heard, the warmth that I’ve felt here in Nauru and I will  tell the Australian Parliament that there is a better way; a better way than the failed East Timor solution, the  problematic PNG solution and the deeply flawed Malaysian swap deal. There is a better way and it’s here in  Nauru.
