 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 

 Asbestos means Villawood must close: Greens 

 Senator Nettle, 5th April 2006   

 Australian Greens Senator Nettle today called for Villawood immigration detention  centre to be closed after further revelations about asbestos contamination at the  detention centre.    

 Senator Nettle supported the call by the NSW Police Association to close the  detention centre and said that people in the detention centre could be housed in the  community while their immigration status is resolved.    

 "Villawood detention centre has always been a toxic environment for the health,  particularly mental health of immigration detainees, now we know it is worse than we  thought", Senator Nettle said.    

 "Exposure to asbestos now must be added to the list of harms caused by mandatory  detention at Villawood."    

 "The recent James Hardie scandal highlighted that exposure to asbestos is life  threatening."    

 "The medical consensus is that there is no known safe level of exposure to asbestos."    

 "The government must remove the Villawood detainees from further exposure to  dangerous asbestos."    

 "Asylum seekers and others could be placed on bridging visas in the community while  their immigration status is resolved."    

 "Minister Vanstone must ensure her Department undertakes health checks not only of  those currently in detention at Villawood but other former detainees who may have  been exposed to asbestos."
