 Media Statement  Tuesday 2nd October 2007

 

 SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT  Queensland Democrat Senator  QUEENSLAND’S ONLY INDEPENDENT VOICE IN THE SENATE 

 

 

 Anecdotes and Prejudice no basis for refugee intake change   

 Democrat Immigration spokesperson Senator Andrew Bartlett slammed the Immigration Minister’s disclosure  that the decision to reduce Australia’s intake of African refugees was made on the basis of anecdotal evidence.   

 “It’s outrageous that the Minister would be making changes to Australia’s refugee intake on little more than  prejudice and gossip,” Senator Bartlett said.    

 “Mr Andrews is pandering to a Hansonite view of African refugees in Australia, and seems happy to smear  them in the process of trying to snare a few votes.   

 “Our nation’s refugee policy must be based on something more substantial than anecdotes.   

 “If there are genuine issues in our emerging African migrant communities then these issues must be addressed  with appropriate settlement support services.   

 “For someone with such outspoken Christian beliefs the Minister’s attitude and actions are decidedly un-Christian,” Senator Bartlett said.
