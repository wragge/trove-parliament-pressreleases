 Flash choirs to mob regional Australia 

 25 May 2012  SC066/2012 

 Regional Australia is about to be taken over by a creative wave of festivals featuring  flash mob style choirs, claymation, circus acts, and puppets performing in a solar-powered 3D laser show. 

 Arts Minister Simon Crean today announced 33 festival arts projects in communities  around Australia will receive funding through the Festivals Australia program. 

 "Over half a million dollars will be going to support community arts and festival  activities from Albury in New South Wales to Barkly in the Northern Territory and  Queenstown in Tasmania," Mr Crean said. 

 "We have a huge wealth of creative talent in our regions as shown by the diversity  and quality of the successful applicants. 

 "In Queenstown, Tasmania, $25,000 will go to a project commemorating 100 years  since the Mt Lyell Mine Disaster involving a flash choir, a lantern parade and large-scale multi-media works. 

 "The Australian Government is committed to continuing to support opportunities for  creative and artistic expression in our regional communities. 

 "The Festivals Australia program is one way we are enabling our regions to develop  their own innovative arts projects and give community members the chance to be  part of a unique celebration of where they live." 

 The successful applicants include:
