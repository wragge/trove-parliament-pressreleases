 Wayne Swan MP  Federal Labor Shadow Treasurer   

 

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA  30 MAY 2005   

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY   

 SUBJECTS: Foreign debt, current account, Newspoll, John Anderson,  Amanda Vanstone, Georgiou Bill   

 SWAN: Well today the economic complacency of the Howard Government will be on  show for everybody to see.  We’ll have the foreign debt figures and we’ll have the  current account deficit published today.  The foreign debt has already doubled under  this Government, yet we’ve seen in the Budget no plan to deal with the long term  productive issues of the Australian economy.  So when we see those figures today  we’ll be able to have a debate about how we’re going to strengthen this economy into  the long term.  That’s the important debate; the long term prospects of the Australian  economy and how we make it much more productive for the future to guarantee  prosperity for future generations.   

 Journalist: Are you at all concerned about the poll today that shows that the  popularity of the Labor Party has dropped since you opposed the Budget’s tax cuts?   

 SWAN: Well I’m not actually.  These polls bounce around from poll to poll.  We took  the right decision, we took a tough decision, and we took it in the long term national  interest.  The Liberal Party are taking their decisions in their short term interest.   

 Journalist: But they seem to have won over the public.   

 SWAN: Well, I seem to recall at this time last year, after the last Budget, that the  Labor Party primary vote dropped seven points.  That was a Budget which also had a  huge spend in it.  Both those Budgets had huge election spends.  It’s not surprising,  therefore, that you might see some change in the polls shortly after that big spend.   But what we’re interested in here is the long term; we’re interested in the long term  national interest.   

 Journalist: (Inaudible.)   

 SWAN: Well Labor’s ideas are to invest in the productive capacity of the economy, to  put some incentive in the tax system, which is what our tax package does.  It invests  in participation.  To invest in the skills of our work force and provide some national 

 leadership on infrastructure bottlenecks.  This is the long term national debate we  need to have.  Opportunities for doing these things were squandered in the recent  Budget.    

 Journalist: (Inaudible.)   

 SWAN: It certainly is and when we talk about national infrastructure water is part of  that equation. But I’ll leave detailed comment on that to my colleagues.   

 Journalist: Are you concerned about the allegations and the report that’s been  around for some six months or thereabouts on smuggling and an alleged drug ring  and the like in Sydney airport?   

 SWAN: We have been raising our concerns about airport security in the Parliament  continuously through this session of Parliament because this Government has been  negligent in this area.  We’ve seen the whole debate in the Parliament about the  absence of a key official from his task of securing airport security.   

 Journalist: John Anderson’s said he’s been aware of the issues in this, since the  report was out.   

 SWAN: Frankly, John Anderson has been pathetic in his administration of this area of  public policy, but once again I’ll leave that to my colleagues to talk about.   

 Journalist: What do you think will happen in the Party room today in terms of  detention?  Do you want to make any projections?   

 SWAN: Well I hope Petro Georgiou gets substantial support in the Liberal Party room  today.  Certainly we share his objective of getting the kids out of detention.  We  certainly share that objective, but I’m not so sure that too many of Petro Georgiou’s  colleagues share our objectives.   

 Journalist: What about the changes that Immigration Minister Vanstone has made …  (inaudible) … ?   

 SWAN: As I said last week, Amanda Vanstone should be removed from that portfolio  immediately.  She has no credibility or standing or authority.   

 ENDS.
