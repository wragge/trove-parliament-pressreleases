 Migration and Refugee Review Tribunal Reappointments 

 21 June 2006 

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Amanda Vanstone today announced the  reappointment of 25 existing members to both the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and the  Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT). 

 “The cross-appointment of full-time and part-time members, which began two years ago, is  now complete,” Senator Vanstone said. 

 “The process allows the tribunals to operate more effectively and efficiently by providing  them with the flexibility to allocate members to address changes in workload in each  tribunal. In particular, it will increase the RRT’s capacity to respond to the Government’s  recently proposed time limit of 90 days for RRT reviews.” 

 Each of the reappointed members will be serving a three-year term, from 1 July 2006 to 30  June 2009. 

 As at 1 July, the tribunals will have a total membership of 82, all of whom are cross-appointed to both tribunals (a principal member, six senior members, 13 full-time members  and 62 part-time members). The deputy principal member position for the RRT is currently  filled by a senior member on an acting basis. 

 “The reappointment of the existing members will enable the tribunals to continue to deliver  merits review in a fair, just, economical and timely manner,” the Minister Vanstone said. 

 The MRT provides independent merits review of general migration decisions and the RRT  provides independent merits review of decisions relating to protection visas.
