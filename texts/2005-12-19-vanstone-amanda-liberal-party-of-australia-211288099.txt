 Migration and Refugee Tribunal Appointments

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, today announced the re-appointment of Bruce  MacCarthy and Giles Short as senior members of the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT), and their cross-appointment to the Migration Review  Tribunal (MRT). 

 Mr MacCarthy and Mr Short have been appointed to the tribunals for a three-year term, from 1 January 2006. 

 Senator Vanstone also announced the cross-appointment of three existing senior members and five full-time members of the MRT to the RRT, and  three existing senior members and 10 full-time members of the RRT to the MRT, for the duration of their current terms of appointment. 

 The cross-appointment of tribunal members, which began last year, is now complete. The process allows the tribunals to operate more effectively  and efficiently by providing them the flexibility to allocate members to address changes in workload in each tribunal. In particular, it will increase  the RRT’s capacity to respond to the Government’s recently proposed time limit of 90 days for RRT reviews. 

 There will now be 93 members appointed to the MRT (a principal member, seven senior members, 15 full-time members and 70 part-time  members), and 94 members appointed to the RRT (a principal member, a deputy principal member, seven senior members, 15 full-time members  and 70 part-time members). 

 ‘The cross-appointment of all members will enable the tribunals to continue to deliver merits review in a fair, just, economical and timely manner,’  Senator Vanstone said. 

 The MRT provides independent merit reviews of general migration decisions and the RRT provides independent merit reviews of decisions  relating to protection visas.
