  Media Release

  The Hon Philip Ruddock, MP

  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

  

  

  New Book 
Shows People Smugglers Can   
Charge $40,000 Per Passenger

  MPS 176/99 

  The Minister for Immigration 
and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today laun  ched a publication which reveals that people smugglers 
can demand up to $40,000 per passenger for arranging illegal travel 
to Australia. 

  Launching   Protecting 
the Border: Immigration Compliance  in Canberra today, Mr Ruddock 
said the book gave information about the routes, last ports of embarkation 
and staging points for people being smuggled, mainly from the Middle 
East. 

  "People smuggling and trafficking can be lucrative 
for the organisers and is increasingly the work of sophisticated criminal 
networks," he said. 

  "Australia is determined to keep the pressure 
on people smugglers as part of our commitment to protecting the integrity 
of Australia's borders and migration programs. 

  Mr Ruddock described the book as a quick and comprehensive 
reference for anyone needing figures and background information about 
his Department's law-enforcement and intelligence activities, including 
those carried out in cooperation with other agencies. 

  "Increasingly, Australia has become a target 
for people who attempt to abuse immigration law in many different ways," 
he said. "For example, in 1998-99, over 400 people were stopped 
from travelling to Australia illegally and close to 10,000 people were 
made to leave Australia following compliance action. 

  "Over 13,000 people were caught in breach of 
their visa conditions or as overstayers, and 2,335 people were discovered 
working in breach of their visa conditions. 

  The publication includes figures and information 
about other aspects of immigration law enforcement, including people 
entering into contrived marriages for the purposes of gaining residence 
in Australia, couriers who assist unauthorised people to enter Australia, 
and trafficking of women working in the sex industry. 

  Protecting 
the Border   also outlines the comprehensive measures Australia 
has set in place, including recent initiatives such as: 

  â¢   improving Coastwatch, Customs and Navy capabilities; 

  â¢   increasing penalties for people-smugglers; 

  â¢   extra resources to detect and deter unauthorised 
travellers; 

  â¢   an overseas information campaign aimed at people-smugglers 
and their targets; and 

  â¢   excluding unauthorised arrivals from accessing permanent 
residence by giving genuine refugees a three-year temporary protection 
visa or a short-term safe haven visa. 

  The book will be wi  dely distributed to law enforcement agencies, community 
organisations, schools, universities and libraries. It is also available 
on the Department's Internet site at    www.immi.gov.au/illegals/border.htm  .
