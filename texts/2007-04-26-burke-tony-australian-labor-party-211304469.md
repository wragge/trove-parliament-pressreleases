 MEDIA STATEMENT 

 TONY BURKE MP  Member for Watson 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration,  Integration and Citizenship 

 

 26 April 2007  

 

 ANDREWS FAILS THE COMMON SENSE TEST … AGAIN   

 Shadow Minister for Immigration, Integration and Citizenship, Tony Burke today said  the Minister Kevin Andrews hasn’t got a clue when it comes to deterring people-smugglers.     

 The Minister today attacked Labor for its plans to abolish the temporary protection visa  (TPV).  Tony Burke hit back, saying the Government should read its own statistics.      

 “When temporary protection visas were introduced, the number of boats actually  increased.  There were 12,000 unauthorised boat arrivals between 1999, when TPVs were  introduced, and December 2001.      

 “However, at the end of 2001, something changed. Since December 2001, the number of  unauthorised arrivals has plummeted to 153.     

 “What changed was the excision of Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Island, and  Ashmore Reef from the migration zone in September 2001 - which Labor supported.”    

 “TPVs were introduced in 1999 with bipartisan support in good faith that TPVs would  stop people-smugglers.  Well, the results are now in.”    

 Tony Burke also said another compelling reason to abolish TPVs is the Government’s  own statistics that show almost 9,000 are later provided with a permanent protection  visa[1].     

 “There is no greater barrier to integration than accepting refugees into our country but  telling them, ‘don’t make yourself at home just yet’.    

  “That is why I want to be able to say after tomorrow that Labor believes it’s better for  Australia to make a decision.  If someone’s not a refugee, they get on a plane and go  home.  If they are, they should get on with their new life as part of the Australian  community.”

 [1]  In Senate Estimates (12 February 2007), the Department of Immigration stated: “Broadly speaking,  about 10,800 people since 1999 have been granted temporary protection visas or other kinds of temporary  humanitarian visas. To date, about 8,900 have received a permanent visa. There are some 660 awaiting a  decision on a further protection visa from the department or the Refugee Review Tribunal.”
