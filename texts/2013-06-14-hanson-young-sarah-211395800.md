 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 14 June 2013   

 Level heads needed in immigration debate   

 An important and reasoned discussion regarding the case of an Egyptian man accused of crimes  by the Mubarak regime was made impossible by the hyperbolic rhetoric of the Coalition which is  more interested in whipping up fear and hatred than dealing with the facts, the Australian Greens  have said.   

 "This situation should have been handled delicately, but the Coalition's relentless fear mongering  against refugees made that impossible,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young said.   

 "Their eagerness to exploit situations for their own political gain means they shoot first and ask  questions later, ruining any chance of a rational debate on important issues.   

 "The reality is many of the people who are seeking protection around the world have fled  oppressive regimes, where they do not have basic rights under the law which we take for granted  here in Australia.    

 "No one who understands the realities faced by refugees who have fled abuse and persecution at  the hands of oppressive regimes would be surprised that claims made by those regimes are not  always correct.   

 "The Greens’ essential role in the Senate is becoming increasingly clear as the Coalition's  relentless fear campaign reaches its climax in the lead up to the election.”
