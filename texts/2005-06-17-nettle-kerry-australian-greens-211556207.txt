 Vanstone peddles half truths to primary  school kids 

 17th Jun 2005 

 Green Senator Kerry Nettle has criticised the educational materials  launched today by Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone as 'half  truths' that insult kids and teachers who deserve to know the full story  about this government's treatment of refugees.  "Because these materials avoid mention of detention centres, or  temporary protection visas they can only be seen as propaganda  cynically directed at the most impressionable in the community,"  Senator Nettle said.   "The materials ignore the fact that some refugees are kept in  detention centres for years or that on their release they are not given  full rights and assistance but left to suffer on Temporary Protection  Visas.  "It's clearly misleading only to talk about refugees settled in Australia  via the Humanitarian programme because that excludes refugees who  have come through the onshore programme and made claims whilst in  immigration detention.  "The Greens are concerned that the government should spend tax  dollars producing 'educational' materials for school children which are  little more than propaganda.  "If the Minister is genuinely concerned to educate primary school  students about how Australia helps refugees then she should issue a 

 brochure detailing why some refugees have their rights curtailed via  Temporary Protection Visas and why so many refugees suffer mental  health problems as a result of their cruel treatment in immigration  detention centres."
