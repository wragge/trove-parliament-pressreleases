 Media Statement: 30th March 2007

 SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT Queensland Democrat Senator

 QUEENSLAND’S ONLY INDEPENDENT VOICE IN THE SENATE 

 

 IMMIGRATION MINISTER SHOULD FIX MIGRATION LAW FLAWS,  NOT RE-RUN OLD SCARE CAMPAIGNS ON REFUGEES   

 

 Democrats Deputy Leader, Andrew Bartlett has criticised the Immigration Minister’s proposal to have Indonesia  assessing asylum seekers, saying the Minister should focus on fixing up our ridiculously bureaucratic migration  laws, not using refugees as pawns in pre-election stunts.   

 “It is time to bring some common sense and balance back into our migration debate, and focus on the real  issues which affect Australia’s future, rather than re-running scare campaigns from the past,” Senator Bartlett  said.    

 “Our Migration Act currently has 147 distinct visa classes and sub-classes, which has produced a ridiculously  complex system and serious problems with logjams and inconsistencies.”   

 “The unnecessary complexity of our migration laws is leading to lost economic opportunities and social  benefits, and costing taxpayers millions of dollars due to unnecessary red tape.”   

  “Saber rattling about sending asylum seekers to Indonesia just shows the Howard government has no new  ideas and no vision on how to improve our migration system.”   

 “Any suggestion Australia should expand the practice of forcing asylum seekers to other countries also makes  a mockery of the four hundred million dollars which has just been spent on a new, maximum security detention  centre on Christmas Island.”
