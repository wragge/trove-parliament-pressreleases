 Australia becomes a target destination for people smugglers   

 A suspected illegal entry vessel carrying 63 people  was intercepted by Australian Customs and Border  Protection south west of Ashmore Island last week.   

 Dr Sharman Stone, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship said this is the third vessel holding  over 50 people in the past four weeks, with a boat intercepted just last Thursday in the Torres Strait and  another on the 15 of March on the north shore of the Northern Territory.    

 “It is very concerning that this boat again carries a larger number of people and that smugglers are  sending larger vessels to get to Australian waters.”   

 “Australia is fast becoming a target destination for people smugglers. These smugglers have a complete  disregard for human life, as they continue to dangerously bring desperate people into our country,” Dr  Stone said.   

 “Quite clearly the message received by the people smugglers is that this is a lucrative market with strong  chances of success. “   

 “Unfortunately each asylum seeker accepted via Christmas Island, replaces one of the asylum seekers  currently stranded in a war zone or hell-hole on a boarder, where there is no prospect of raising the cash  or finding the contact to engage people smugglers to sail you into Australian waters.”   

 “There is a real confusion of the responsibilities of Minister for Home Affairs, Bob Debus, Minister for  Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans and Minister for Defence, Joel Fitzgibbon.”   

 “These three ministers need to be in the same place at the same time to discuss the strategy ahead, save  lives, and to restore Australia’s reputation as a country that takes boarder security seriously,” Dr Stone  said.
