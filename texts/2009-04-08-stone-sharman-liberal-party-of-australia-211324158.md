 THE HON DR SHARMAN STONE MP  Federal Member for Murray  Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 

 Wedneday 8 April 2009 

 Go directly to Christmas Island, don’t wait to be found 

 Another boat load of 40 suspected asylum seekers has literally delivered themselves to Christmas  Island yesterday morning, this time with reports suggesting the boat arrived completely  undetected. 

 Dr Sharman Stone, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship said it was appalling to think  that the re-badged Australian Customs and Border Protection Authority is so inept and under  resourced that our people smugglers are literally delivering their customers direct into detention  on Christmas island. 

 “It would seem this boat was not spotted by aerial or on water surveillance,” Dr Stone said. 

 “This is the third boat in the last five days and in all three cases, we have seen bungling and  ineptitude including leaving one boat of over 50 people stranded on a reef for over four days. 

 “This is the twelfth boat since August when the Rudd Labor Government softened border  protection federal funding policies. There have also been 17 boats intercepted by the Indonesian  Government on our behalf. 

 “ While it is very good news that this boat, including women and children, has been brought safely  to  Christmas Island, it remains the case that unknown numbers of smuggled people have already lost their  lives. In the latest surge since August, bodies have been reported washing up on Indonesian beaches.  

 “People smuggling continues to be a heinous and inhumane practice,” Dr Stone said. 

 “I have called for an urgent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the stranding of more then 50  people on a reef for four days on the Torres Strait. Clearly the terms of reference now need to be  expanded so we can determine exactly why this government is failing in border protection so  comprehensively.”  

 “There is also growing alarm in Northern Australian waters about the increase in illegal fishing. In  particular the illegal poaching of Beche-de-mer detected but are 50 of the 80 fisherman involved escaped. 

 “I again call on Mr Rudd to call all on Senator Debus, Minister Evans and Minister Fitzgibbon, the three  ministers involved in immigration, customs and border security protection. This minister must be told  they have to do much better on behalf of all Australians.
