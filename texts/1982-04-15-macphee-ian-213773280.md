 STUDY ON ECONOMIC IMPACT OF IMMIGRATION

 A three-year joint research project on the economic impact  of immigration has commenced this month, the Minister for  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee, and the  Chairman of the Research and Policy Committee of the  Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), Mr  Jack Curtis, announced in Perth today. Mr Macphee was in  Perth to address a meeting of CEDA on the new migration policy.

 The project,· to cost $240 000, will be funded jointly by the  Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and CEDA. It  is expected to be completed by-the end of 1984. .  '  -

 A special feature of the project is the joint funding and  administration by Government and business.

 CEDA is an independent organisation of business leaders and  academics concerned with the economic advancement of Australia.-

 "CEDA is committed to concentrating research effort into  important areas of national economic development. The project  - on the economics of immigration is seen as one of the subject  areas warranting deeper, research. CEDA is not committed to 

 abstract academic research, but to a no-nonsense analysis of  public and business policy issues," Mr Curtis said. .  -

 Mr Macphee and Mr Curtis said that both Government and business  recognised the present sensitivity of the Australian economy  to external influences. Even though the objectives of the  immigration program were social and humanitarian, as well as  economic, it was vital that the scale and composition of the 

 intake was such that migrants are absorbed smoothly into the .   economy. .

 The project will start with macro-economic modelling, so  that the economic effects of varying the net immigration  rates can be simulated.' Different econometric models will  be used so that a wide range of assumptions can be  explored. The modelling phase will enable a number of  questions of concern to Government and business to be 

 specified in more detail. .

 The major part of the research work would be to address these  questions through a series of special studies.

 .Thus the project will explore the overall impact of migrants  on national economic growth, the labour market, investment  and consumption, structural change, scale economies, technological  change and innovation. At the same time the special studies  recognise that the impact of the immigration program is not 

 spread evenly across the economy. Migrants tend to concentrate  in certain industries and regions. Moreover, the different  categories of migrants - family, labour shortage and business,  refugee, independent and special - vary widely in their skills  and economic characteristics.

 Mr Macphee and Mr Curtis said that both Government and business "   recognise the significant impact immigration.has upon the  economy. Although CEDA usually pursued its research activities "  independently, it saw particular advantage in pooling resources -  

 and effort with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs ·   for this project. The research would provide valuable input  to Government in formulating its long term policies for  immigration and settlement, and to the business community in 

 its investment and manpower planning.
