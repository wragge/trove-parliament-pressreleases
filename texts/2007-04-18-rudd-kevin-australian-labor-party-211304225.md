 FEDERAL LABOR LEADER  KEVIN RUDD MP   

 TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW, SYDNEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT,  18 APRIL 2007   

 E & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:  Visit to the United States of America; Industrial  Relations; Newspoll; Asylum Seekers Transfer; Migration Report;  Traveston Crossing Dam   

 RUDD:  Well, I leave for the United States today and I’m very much  looking to travelling to Washington and New York.  I’ve travelled to the United  States as a visitor and as a guest many times over the last 15 years.  In 

 Washington, I’m looking forward to a series of working level meetings with the  State Department, the Pentagon, the National Security Council and the Treasury.   These are important because we like to maintain in regular dialogue with our  American friends and allies on the common challenges we face as strategic  partners in the century ahead.  Challenges which relate to our nations’ future  security and strategic stability.  Challenges, also in terms of the global economy  and the future of the international trading regime.   

 I also will be travelling to New York and having meetings with a range of  representatives from the business community and I look forward to that as well.   I’ll be away for three days altogether.     

 I notice Mr Howard has been responding today to the announcements I made  yesterday about our new proposal for an industrial relations system for Australia.   What we want to do is to restore the balance in industrial relations because Mr  Howard has gone too far.  That’s the truth.  And we need to restore that balance  so that it is a fair balance between employers and employees so that we get the  balance right between fairness and flexibility and the workplace.  That’s why, for  example, I’ve taken a strong stand in providing greater flexibility for small  business right across Australia.  Small business are doing a lot for this country’s  long-term economic development and therefore they are important drivers of our  long-term economic growth and many of them grow into bigger businesses and  they also then take on the international market place as well.    

 So, because of small business I’ve taken this new policy of unfair dismissal to  look after their interests during the first year that they have employees working  for them.  We think that small business needs a fair go when it comes to making  a judgment about the people they’ve got working for them for the first year of  their employment.  After that of course, both employees deserve other levels of 

 protection and we’ve built that into our policy as well.  Small business is critical  for the future of the economy.  It’s critical that they have flexibility in their  workplaces and we think we’ve got the balance right for small business when it  comes to the future arrangements we put in place for unfair dismissal laws.   

 Finally, I’ll say this: at the end of the day you can’t please everybody when it  comes to industrial relations laws.  I notice there’s been some criticism from  various trade union leaders today.  I understand there’s been some criticism also 

 from elements of the business community.  I understand that, but my job as the  alternative Prime Minister of Australia, is to get the balance right between  fairness and flexibility for every Australian workplace.  And that’s what we intend  to do.  Over to you.   

 JOURNALIST: Isn’t it true that you have given the unions too much,  everything they wanted, (inaudible) scrapping AWAs (inaudible)?   

 RUDD:  Many trade union leaders did not want us to proceed with a  national uniform industrial relations system for the private economy, they would  prefer to have a return to State based systems across large parts of the country.  

 We’ve said no to that because we believe the national economy demands that  level of national reform.  Secondly, very few trade union leaders would welcome  what we have done in terms of insisting on mandatory secret ballots for industrial  action.  That is new policy for us and I see already negative comments from trade  union leaders about that today.  Thirdly, on the question of strike pay, again we  think that’s important because taking industrial action is a serious step for  families, for businesses and for the economy overall.  We say that there should  be no such thing as strike pay for some sweetheart deal between the employer  and the employee.  All of these things require leadership and all these things are  very controversial amongst the trade union leadership of Australia.  I think if you  go through the detail of those, it’s quite plain that we’ve made our decisions in  the national economic interest.   

 JOURNALIST: Doug Cameron called (inaudible)  Is there any room for  debate.  Will you debate it at the National Conference next weekend before  (inaudible)?    

 RUDD:  Well, Doug Cameron gets it right sometimes and Doug  Cameron gets it wrong sometimes - I’ll have a look at what Doug’s had to say.  We believe we’re going to get the balance right between now and the election.   We have other elements of our industrial relations policy still to be finalised and  still to be released, but I’m confident we are going to get the balance right for  working families.  Working families are under financial pressure across Australia  at present.  Mr Howard has said that working families in Australia have never  been better off and that’s after four interest rates rises, the impact on their  mortgage and that’s in addition to these new unfair industrial relations laws that’s  he’s brought in.  We intend to restore the balance. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Mr Howard calls your plan, though, old-fashioned and says  it’s already (inaudible) unfair dismissal laws.  How will you placate the concerns  of small business (inaudible)?    

 RUDD:  We believe we got the balance right between fairness and  flexibility.  We believe we’ve got the balance right when it comes to the legitimate  needs of small business to have that flexibility in the first year that they employ  new staff - we’ve think we’ve got that right.  But can I say this: Labor’s message  is that we can build long-term prosperity for the economy without throwing the fair  go out the back door - that’s Mr Howard’s script, throwing the fair go out the back  door.  We believe we can balance this and we believe the policies we put forward  head us in that direction.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you have any concerns, though, there are some small  business people are this week concerned about that it could lead to returning to  the go-away money (inaudible) to pay off workers to leave?   

 RUDD:  We have made our unfair dismissal regime lawyer-free,  okay?  And one of the problems in the past may well have been that if you have  lawyers involved it actually increases those risks.  Therefore, by a streamlined  system, by making it lawyer-free and also by exempting small business from  unfair dismissal laws for the first 12 months of a person’s employment, we  believe we’ve got the balance right for small business.  Will this make everybody  perfectly happy?  Of course not, that’s what national leadership is about.   National leadership is about getting the balance right between prosperity, long-term prosperity and the Australian fair go.  Mr Howard has happily thrown the fair  go out the back door and I say this:  [If] Mr Howard was confident about the  statistics and the data about the operation of his Australian Workplace  Agreements, why is it that he refuses to release that data publicly.  We had a  release of some of it in an unauthorised fashion through the Sydney Morning  Herald yesterday.     

 I would say that Mr Howard has a case to answer.  Mr Howard if you are so  proud of the impact of workplace agreements on peoples’ working conditions,  their overtime rates, their penalty rates and their shift allowances, why not  release all the data on the 12 months or so that these laws have been in 

 operation: do you know why?  Because he’s afraid of what the data will say and  yesterday we had a report that the AWAs were generating all sorts of negative  implications for peoples’ basic working conditions.  He want’s to conceal that  data between now and the election.   

 JOURNALIST: How can you have lawyer-free laws? What are you going to  do to keep them away?   

 RUDD:  Well, you make the laws as simple as possible and it’s the  way in which we design the statute around it as well. Julia Gillard has done a lot  of detailed work on this and I’m sure when we come to negotiating also our unfair  dismissal code with the small business sector, all that will be made clear in the  detail as well. We want to get small business out there doing their best for the  economy, for themselves and for the people who work for them and we think  getting rid of this unfair dismissal threat in the first twelve months of a person’s  employment with small business is a step in the right direction.   

 JOURNALIST: Just on another issue on the refugee …   

 RUDD:  Just one point further on IR and then I’ll happily take that. Mr  Howard of course argues this other thing about industrial relations.  He says that  employment growth in this country’s because he’s employed these unfair  industrial relations laws. There is not one element of proof of that produced by  the Commonwealth Treasury. He has not produced any data to back that up. The  Treasury were not asked in the first place to model the employment impact of his  new industrial relations laws. What Mr Howard’s doing is plucking these  arguments out of the air. If you want some data, produce it. Show us what the  Treasury has said. Show us what the Office of the Employment Advocate has  said about the impact on individual working conditions. I also say this, Mr  Howard’s industrial relations laws, have generated two hundred thousand-plus  jobs in the economy since they’ve come in. Well guess what? Some three  hundred thousand-plus jobs were generated in the economy in the year following  Labor’s introduction of enterprise bargaining in the early to mid nineties. I mean,  this argument that Mr Howard has put forward basically lacks any element of  evidence and proof and needs to be confronted in those terms.    

 JOURNALIST: Elements of the union movement are claiming that you’re,  literally, becoming more Liberal than John Howard, that you’re turning your back  on Labor values …   

 RUDD:   Which  elements  are you talking about?   

 JOURNALIST:  (inaudible)  

 

 RUDD:  OK, I haven’t seen those remarks this morning. My job as  the alternative Prime Minister of Australia is to get the balance right between  employers and employees, the balance right between flexibility and fairness and  everyone knows that Mr Howard has gone too far with his unfair industrial  relations laws. But our job overall is to stick up for working families, whether they  are in unions or not in unions. Our job is to stick up for their interests and making  sure we get the balance between fairness and flexibility right and we think we’re  well equipped to do that.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Rudd, are you going to Washington to listen or to tell  them?   

 RUDD:  I often go to listen, and in the case of the United States,  primarily to listen, because there are many things that our countries have as  common challenges in the period ahead. Obviously, we’ve just increased, for  example our troop deployment to Afghanistan. I’m particularly interested in US  analyses of how they see Afghanistan unfolding over the next 12 months-plus.  Similarly developments in Iran are of deep concern to me as well. Our respective  positions on Iraq are well established and I had those discussions in great detail  recently with Vice-President Cheney when he was here in Australia.    

 JOURNALIST: Next time you go will it be on your own jet?   

 RUDD:  My objective over the next six months is to convince the  Australian people that we have a better alternative for their future than Mr  Howard offers. If the Australian people choose to support us at the next election,  I will do everything in my power to work as hard as I can to live up to their  expectations. But there is a lot of hard work over the next five months or so to do 

 that and I’m under no allusions about how tough it will be to beat the most clever  politician this country’s ever seen, Mr Howard.   

 JOURNALIST: What did you think of the poll today that said that 42 per cent  of people had decided, were of the opinion that all State and Territory  governments and a Federal Labor government would not be a good idea? 

 

 RUDD:  Well, Mr Howard is very comfortable with the old politics of  the blame game between Canberra and the States. I’m on about the new politics  of ending the blame game. If the Australian people vote for me at the next  election then I am faced and presented with a unique opportunity to fix the blame  game. In fact, if under those circumstances I didn’t fix the blame game and saved  the amount of money that is currently being wasted on duplication and overlap  between Canberra and the States, I would have no excuse. So, I’d turn this 

 argument completely on its head. That presents me with an alternative to fix the  blame game, the blame shift, the cost shift between Canberra and the States,  save billions of dollars and invest that money instead in hospitals, schools and in  transport. That’s what I want to do.   

 JOURNALIST: Pizza, chocolate pizza making and dancing, anything to do  your credentials and might be something to do with the US (inaudible)?   

 RUDD:  When it comes to pizza, it’s the first time I’ve had any  experience with chocolate pizza, of course they tasted pretty good. No, I think  when it comes to discussions in Washington it’s very unlikely to be pizza- based 

 but I had a bit of fun this morning, it was good and she’s, Kerry-Ann’s a very  good teacher of the rumba. 

 

 JOURNALIST: What topic do you want to cover in your meeting with US  Treasury?   

 RUDD:  Oh well, I am concerned about their prognosis for the future  of the international economy. I also want to look at where they see the forces  across the world going in terms of protectionism. I also want to talk to the  Americans about how they see the impact unfolding over time of the economic  cost of climate change. This is a global challenge requiring a global solution and  that is an important area for discussion with the Americans as well. But the  Treasury, the US Treasury, is a formidable institution and I look forward to those  discussions very much.   

 JOURNALIST: And your thoughts just in regards to Kevin Andrews’ refugee  exchange (inaudible) with the US?   

 RUDD:  I’ve read this report this morning and I haven’t had a chance  to talk to Tony Burke about it yet, the Shadow Minister, but it strikes me as  passing strange that we now will be playing ‘swapsies’, you know, maybe there’s  something in this that I’m not seeing and I make no commentary whatsoever on  the American side of this negotiation, that’s a matter for them. But what is seems  that Mr Howard is doing is saying, come here to Australia as an asylum seeker,  be processed offshore, be sent then possibly to America to receive the same  number of asylum seekers back here. I mean I’m struggling with where all that  goes in terms of the logic, maybe there’s some that I just don’t get at the  moment. Of course there’s an argument which Tony Burke I think has put himself  today is that, in effect, is Mr Howard also saying to anyone seeking to come here  as an asylum seeker Australia becomes a halfway house to the United States?  But I look forward to reading the full detail on this.  It just strikes me as a little  passing strange from the report that I’ve just seen.   

 JOURNALIST: And you’re inclined to raise it when you go to Washington?   

 RUDD:  No I’d just like to get to the bottom of the detail of it. There  may be some element of this from the American’s side that I just haven’t got  across at this stage. I’d rather have these discussions first from the Australian  side though, sending 200 from, let’s call it the Pacific Solution to America to get  200 back, is Mr Howard’s ultimate interest this? When Tampa happened Mr  Howard said not one of these asylum seekers will set foot in Australia. Guess  what happened afterwards? More than half of them did. That’s the truth of it. I  think Mr Howard is stung by that and, therefore, what he wants is some formula  so that when people come to Australia, or seek to come to Australia as asylum  seekers, he can say they’ve actually then set foot in another country as opposed  to Australia, despite the fact that the same number from a different country of  origin end up here.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Rudd just for our Queensland colleagues, what do you  think of the Traveston Crossing Dam?   

 RUDD:  This is a very controversial proposal for South-East  Queensland and it is controversial in the eyes of local landholders in the area,  also controversial environmentally. That’s why it’s important to study carefully the  detail of the environment impact assessment which is currently underway. Of  course the Federal Government has a key role in this through the Federal 

 Environment Minister, Mr Malcolm Turnbull. And so we had the Queensland  National Party campaigning against the Traveston Dam, but the Queensland  Liberals, it seems, remaining remarkably silent on the Traveston Dam and where  Malcolm Turnbull is on the Traveston Dam, who knows? Thank you.
