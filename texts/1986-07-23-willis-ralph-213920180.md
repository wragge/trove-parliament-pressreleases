 CEP BOOST TO PEGASUS RIDING FOR THE DISABLED

 The Pegasus Riding for the Disabled centre at Holt is to receive 

 a grant of $23,047 to employ two people as trainee insructors 

 under the Federal Government's Community Employment program 

 (CEP).  -

 The Pegasus Centre is one of 24 new CEP projects in the ACT 

 announced today by the Minister for Employment and Industrial 

 Relations, Ralph Willis, and the Minister for Territories, Gordon 

 Scholes.

 Pegasus began its work for the disabled in 1973 when it took two 

 young disabled people for their first rides on horseback. It 

 became an incorporated charitable organisation in 1975 and in 

 1978 the centre was granted the lease of a 28 hectare farm which 

 has since been developed into a large centre for the disabled.

 Mr Willis and Mr Scholes said the CEP projects, which would 

 receive a total of $742,605 in funding, were labour intensive and 

 had been sponsored by a wide range of community-service 

 organisations, the NCDC, the AND and the Department of 

 Territories.

 They said the projects would employ a total of 86 people for 

 between 24 and 26 weeks.

 The projects would benefit the ACT community while providing 

 participants with new skills and work experience which would .  

 assist them in finding secure employment in the future.
