  THE INFORMATION KIT, AUSTRALIAN IMMIGRATION: THE FACTS

  

  STAGE 2: AUSTRALIAN IMMIGRATION: THE FACTS

  

  Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

  â¢  Today I want to talk about a number of issues.

  

  â¢  I want to tell you about my national campaign aimed at putting 
some truth back in to the immigration debate and showing how migration 
benefits all Australians. I am also going to announce a second phase 
of the campaign, but more on that later.

  

  THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE

  

 There is no doubt that seriously flawed information 
is being spread about the migration program - and ideas and policies 
are being circulated which have more to do with slick rhetoric than 
substance.

  

  - Clearly in many 
cases the people propagating this rhetoric have either very  little 
knowledge of how programs work or, and perhaps more to the point - don’t 
want to know.

  

 - Why 
let the facts stand in the way of a good story.

  

  â¢  And the facts speak for themselves.

  

  â¢  Just this week I read a newspaper report in which an ANU 
professor was quoted as saying people   “failed to recognise that migrants generated more jobs than they 
take”

  

  â¢  Research in Australia and overseas has consistently shown 
that skilled migrants have a highly positive impact on the economy, 
government finances and employment levels as they create more jobs than 
they take.

  

  â¢  Recognising this, the Coalition has shifted the balance 
of the migration program towards skilled migration from around 30 per 
cent in 1995-96 to more than 50 per cent in 1998-99.

  

  â¢  The results of recent research undertaken or commissioned 
by my Department demonstrate that this shift will deliver significant 
economic benefits to Australia creating jobs and providing money for 
investment.

  

  â¢  Let me give you some examples.

  

  â¢  The research organisation, Access Economics recently surveyed 
nearly 1500 business migrants who arrived between 1992 and 1996. It 
assessed their efforts in Australia 24 and 36 months after their arrival.

  

  - As a matter of 
interest, those business people surveyed came mainly from  South 
East and North Asia, the U.K., South Africa, the U.S. and Kenya.

  

  â¢  The organisation found that business migrants are highly 
successful in the areas of exports, job generation, net worth, business 
survival and technological innovation.

  

  - In additio n, 
business migrants tended to employ a slightly larger number of employees 
on average than equivalent Australian firms - each new business created 
6.5 jobs while existing businesses created 6.2.

  

  â¢  They were also more likely to remain viable in business 
than Australian firms - an exit rate of 5.6 per cent per year compared 
with 7.7 per cent for Australian businesses.

  

  â¢  Here are some more   facts :

  

  - Each firm had 
an average net worth of $600 000.

  

  - Just under 70 
per cent were exporting, with annual export  sales averaging $365,000 
per firm. Those with between 5 and 99 employees exported twenty per 
cent more than Australian firms.

  

 - 36 
per cent were undertaking some form of technological innovation in the 
previous three years compared with 26 per cent for Australian firms.

  

 - A 
staggering $962 million dollars worth of funds and assets had been transferred 
by this group of business migrants and their families.

  

  â¢  Over 4500 business people - not including their families 
- have arrived as business skills migrants since the scheme was introduced 
in 1992.

  

  â¢  Who could doubt that their presence has benefited Australia?

  

  â¢  If only those responsible for propagating myths about migrants 
took more notice of the benefits migrants bring!

  

  â¢  Instead, they continue to spread misinformation and wilfully 
distort the facts without reference to easily available information 
and without being accountable.

  

  â¢  These myths and distortions prey on community anxieties 
and create unnecessary fear of Australia’s migration program and the 
good people who arrive here to make Australia their home.

  

  â¢  Such divisive tactics should be condemned as un-Australian.

  

  â¢   I believe our immigration program   does  have the support of most Australians.

  

  â¢  And I have been determined to present the facts.

  

  â¢  I have ensured that all available data and information about 
Australia’s migration program is widely distributed and discussed 
in numerous forums — 

  

  - Including by 
holding two of the first public meetings on immigration matters ever 
held in this country.

  

  â¢  And I have been resolute in promoting the benefits of past, 
present and future migration to this country — 

  

  - Including the 
launch of several information packages on productive diversity.

  

  â¢  I will continue this approach.

  

  â¢  I am visiting every State and Territory to launch three 
important initiatives which underline the government’s commitment.

  

  â¢  These initiatives 
will help ensure the protection and safekeeping of Australia’s migration 
heritage and the present reality of its cultural diversity.

  

  â¢  These products 
are my Department’s Client Service Charter, the Charter of Public 
Service in a Culturally Diverse Society and the information kit,   Australian immigration  the facts.

  

  â¢  Among other 
things they will help ensure that no Australian, whatever their background, 
has to face any barriers to full participation in our society.

  

  â¢  This is 
not only because it is the right thing to do - it is the Australian 
way to give everyone “a fair go”.

  

  â¢  By using 
the skills and expertise of all Australians, including migrants, we 
develop as a nation - both socially and economically - in which all 
Australians can reap the benefits.

  

  â¢  Let me now talk about these three products in more detail:

  

  THE CLIENT SERVICE CHARTER

  

  â¢  My Department’s Client Service Charter was developed to 
ensure clients receive high quality service.

  

  â¢  The charter 
sets out standards which clearly explain what clients can expect from 
us and what, as a Department, we need from clients so that we can do 
our job.

  

  - That is, to deal 
with inquiries and applications in an informative, helpful and efficient 
mann er and without discrimination.

  

  â¢  A key element 
of the new charter has been to give clients a voice:

  

  - They will be 
able to make suggestions or complaints or, for that matter, compliment 
staff on the provision of good service;

  

  - While clients 
will be enc ouraged to resolve issues with the person who provided 
the service, if this does not work they will be able to take the matter 
up with a complaints officer;

  

  - These officers 
are based in all states and territories and at most overseas posts.

  

  â¢  Importantly, 
clients need to know that if they make a complaint it will in no way 
impact on the outcome of their application.

  

  â¢  Clients 
also need to know what the charter does not do, in particular it does 
not give clients access to review of unfavourable decisions.

  

  â¢  The charter 
is about the quality of service delivery - not decision outcomes.

  

  - This is a very 
important distinction.

  

  - Good client service 
doesn’t always mean saying ‘yes’.

  

  - In fact, in order 
to deliver a balanced migration program that is in Aus tralia’s 
best interests we often have to say ‘no’.

  

  - But when we say 
‘no’, we must do so in a clear and courteous manner.

  

  â¢  As a final point, it is important to remember that some 
services are provided through the private or community sectors.

  

  - Even so , 
the government remains responsible for the quality of all of these services 
- such as English language tuition provided under the AMEP.

  

 - While 
the standards for these services are set out in the contracts, complaints 
arrangements still apply.

  

  â¢  I see the Department’s new charter as an important step 
in bringing down the barriers to government services and full participation 
in Australian life.

  

  THE CHARTER OF PUBLIC SERVICE IN A CULTURALLY DIVERSE SOCIETY

  

  â¢   The Department’s charter is linked to a whole of government 
commitment which is set out in the Charter of Public Service in a Culturally 
Diverse Society.

  

  â¢  This charter 
applies to the whole public service and aims to ensure that all Commonwealth 
Government services are responsive to the needs of our culturally diverse 
society.

  

  â¢  Already 
many federal and state government departments are pursuing policies 
and programs consistent with this charter.

  

  â¢  At the Commonwealth 
level there’s been considerable progress in ensuring all government 
services are planned and delivered with the needs of our culturally 
diverse society in mind.

  

  â¢  This whole 
of government approach specifies the values and standards of client 
service that people can expect from particular government agencies.

  

  AUSTRALIAN IMMIGRATION THE FACTS

  

  â¢  These two charters are, among other things, about delivering 
consistently high quality, professional services in a non-discriminatory 
way.

  

  - Which brings 
me to the third and final product - Australian immigration the facts 
- and how it sets out some factual information abou t our non-discriminatory 
migration program - something Australia should be very proud of.

  

  â¢  It might be a tough program with strict objective criteria.

  

  â¢  It is a 
program with health and character requirements.

  

  â¢  It is a program that emphasises skills and encourages people 
to settle in regional Australia.

  

  â¢  It is definitely a program that seeks to benefit all Australians.

  

  â¢  And it is 
a program under which migrants come to Australia to realise their dreams 
and aspirations - to create work and build a nation; to generate goodwill 
for increased tourism; to benefit business by creating links in an increasingly 
competitive world.

  

  â¢  The kit 
sets out the facts about these issues.

  

  â¢  In recent 
times, it has become difficult for people to distinguish fact from fiction 
in the debate about immigration and cultural diversity.

  

  â¢  This concerns me, and as a result I sought to have the kit 
I launched last year updated so that I could directly address community 
concerns.

  

  â¢  The first 
edition was a ‘sell out’. Over 15,000 copies were distributed, and 
even now, the kit’s internet site alone averages 800 ‘hits’ per 
week.

  

  - I can tell you 
that in the few weeks this new kit has been available my Department 
has been inundated with requests for bulk copies - even from people 
i n states which I had not then visited. We have already increased 
the print run by several thousands.

  

  â¢  Who is asking? Schools; politicians; community organisations; 
individuals; migration agents; diplomats; universities — and the list 
goes on.

  

  â¢  The message is getting out and it is being heard.

  

  â¢   So, what 
makes this new kit so popular? Quite simply, it addresses the myths 
that have been repeatedly given public voice in recent times.

  

  â¢  It sets 
out the facts so that people can make informed judgements about the 
issues.

  

  â¢  And these 
are facts not as the government sees them - but the facts as they are.

  

  â¢  For example 
there has been some debate about the need for migrants to speak English.

  

  - The fact is that 
75 per cent of migrants have a high level of Eng lish and of those 
who don’t many are in fact refugees.

  

  â¢  Many people seem to believe that migrants go straight on 
to welfare.

  

  - Wrong. Most newly 
arrived migrants are not allowed to access welfare until they have been 
in Australia for at least two years.  One of the main exceptions 
is refugees who have come to Australia often in desperate circumstances.

  

  â¢  The truth is that migrants have made, and continue to make, 
major contributions in the fields of medicine, science, primary industry, 
mining, sport, education, the arts and culture and business.

  

  â¢  As I said earlier, migrants are good for Australia.

  

  AUSTRALIAN IMMIGRATION THE FACTS: STAGE TWO

  

  â¢  The release of the kit in Canberra today signals the drawing 
to a close of the first stage of this campaign.

  

  â¢  As I have 
toured Australia I have become increasingly aware that many Australians 
recognise the benefits of our culturally diverse society.

  

  â¢  But I have 
also become aware that many people are unsure of how to voice that support 
and what impact a lone voice might have.

  

  â¢  The first 
stage of this campaign has been about getting the facts out in to the 
community.

  

  â¢  It is the 
success of this first stage - and the confirmation that the public really 
want to know the truth about the issues - that led me to the decision 
just this week to extend my current campaign.

  

  â¢  I have decided that there will be a second phase in the 
campaign; details of which I will announce at a later stage.

  

  â¢  What I can 
tell you now is that it will give people a voice.

  

  - To stand united 
against the threats to Australia’s multicultural soci ety and 
to speak with one voice.

  

  â¢  It will include a speaker’s kit that will enable every 
Australian, whether at home or at work, to convey the truth about immigration 
and the success of our culturally diverse society.

  

  â¢  Over the 
next few weeks I will be sending it to all Members of Parliament, regardless 
of their political persuasion, so that they can play their part to ensure 
the truth is out there.

  

  â¢ CONCLUSION

  

  â¢  I would now like to move to the less formal part of the 
day.

  

  â¢  In 1987 
founding member of the famous singing group The Seekers and Australian 
of the Year in 1967, Bruce Woodley, wrote the song   I Am Australian . His daughter Claire is with us today.

  

  â¢   I understand 
from Bruce that the song started with the belief that it is possible 
to talk about national unity particularly in a country with such a diverse 
ethnic background as ours.

  

  â¢  Since 1987 
the song has found its way into the homes and hearts of millions of 
Australians and has become art of community life and helped create a 
deep sense of belonging.

  

  â¢  I now invite 
you to join me in listening to Claire Woodley and members of the Woden 
Valley Youth Choir sing   I Am Australian .

  

  â¢ Thank-you
