 ABBOTT GREEN LIGHT SEES THE BOATS KEEP COMING    

 Tony Abbott’s aggressive negativity continues to play into the hands of people smugglers,  with another asylum seeker boat intercepted overnight - the 45th since the Coalition rejected  the Government’s offer to implement offshore processing.   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said Mr Abbott had backed up his negativity by voting against  offshore processing in Parliament last week.   

 “This Government is committed to breaking the people smugglers’ business model with a  genuine deterrent, but any offshore processing solution - Nauru or Malaysia - requires  legislation,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “Tony Abbott and the Coalition continue to block this legislation in the Parliament.   

 “This increased people smuggling activity again clearly makes the case for the Government’s  Malaysia Arrangement, which all expert advice says can smash this vile trade.”   

 Mr Clare said it was time for Tony Abbott to stop standing in the way of offshore processing.   

 “We can help stop people dying at sea, but this requires Mr Abbott to stop blocking the  legislation in the Parliament,” Mr Clare said.   

 “If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must stop voting against offshore  processing and pass the legislation in the Parliament to allow asylum seekers to be  processed offshore in Malaysia and Nauru.”
