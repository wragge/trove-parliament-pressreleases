 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  HON ALEXANDER DOWNER, MP   

 

 TRANSCRIPTION: PROOF COPY E & OE   

 

 DATE: March 5 2004 

 TITLE:   Doorstop, Mayo Electorate Office   

 Downer: This is to say something about Nauru and the relationship between Australia  and Nauru.  We’ve now concluded a new memorandum of understanding with Nauru, which  provides for the continuation of the asylum seeker processing centre on Nauru until June  2005.  It also includes a commitment by the Australian Government to support Nauru at this  very difficult time for the country.  We’ll be spending about $22 million over a two year  period in support of Nauru.  That will involve helping them with their health and education  services and their infrastructure, which has some substantial problems.  We’ll also be sending  a police commissioner, or else a very senior police office to assist with the administration of  the police in Nauru.  And we’ll be sending an Australian, probably from our Treasury, to be  the Secretary of Finance.  We are deeply concerned about the financial situation of Nauru.   There needs to be a proper audit of their net assets.  We need to have an understanding of  what Nauru’s net assets are.  And also the turnover as well, that the country has, so that we  can make assessments of what future options there might be for Nauru in terms of the  livelihoods of the 10,000 or so people who live there.  I think Nauru’s coming to a very  challenging time in its history, and the people of Nauru, the Government of Nauru, and  Australia need to keep talking about what the long-term destiny for Nauru will be - where  they’ll be able to generate sufficient income to maintain their living standards.  If they can’t  how else will they get by?  These sorts of questions are going to have to be considered.  And  sending in a Secretary of Finance as an initial step I think is an important way of helping them  get on top of their financial situation.  Once we’ve been able to do that, we’ll be able to look  at further options for how we might be able to help the people of Nauru in the future.   

 Journalist: So how do you think beyond that cut-off date they…   

 Downer: First of all, in terms of the processing centre it’s our view that the offshore  processing centre system works extremely well.  It’s been a very good idea.  And it’s been  one of the reasons why we’ve been so successful in reducing the number of illegal migrants  we’ve had coming to Australia.  Of course there have been other factors as well.  But this has  been an important component of that.  The people smugglers know that they can’t get people  to Australia to stay.  They can only get people to the excised islands.  But if those people are  then to be processed as asylum seekers then they’ll be taken to Nauru for processing.  It’s a  very different situation from being able to get into the country and being able to stay here and  clog up the courts, in order to be able to stay as has been proven to be the case so often in the  past.

 Journalist:  Inaudible.  

 

 Downer: No we’re not planning to close it.  We’re keeping it open until June 2005.  And  beyond that we’ll just wait and see.  We’ll see where we’re at by June 2005.   

 Journalist: The additional arrival of boatpeople, will they be sent to Nauru?   

 Downer: It’s too early to know the answer to that because we need to know more about  these people.  If of course they turned out to be asylum seekers, well then their applications  would have to be processed, and it’s possible that they could be processed in Nauru.  If they  turn out to be people who have come from a ship-wreck, or something like that, then we  would obviously restore them to where they want to go back to.  If on the other hand, this is  one other third option, they’re simply people who have been trying to come to Australia  illegally, as illegal migrants, and are not seeking asylum, if for example they’ve come from  Indonesia which is a possibility, it’s possible they could have just come from Indonesia -  Indonesians from Indonesia - and trying to get into Australia illegally, then we would return  them to Indonesia.  So there isn’t a short answer to this because we don’t know enough about  them at this stage and we’ll have to wait the reports from the Navy and the Customs Service  as to who they are, what they’re doing.  But they got to Ashmore Reef and there’s no sign of  any boat there.  An interesting question.   

 Journalist: How long have they got before they have to apply for asylum?   

 Downer: I think I’m right in saying you can apply for asylum at any time.  I don’t think  there’s a time-frame there.  But I don’t know what they are going to do.  Let’s suspend  judgement about these people until we know more about them.  For all we know they could  be from a ship-wreck.  They could be asylum seekers.  They could just be straight-out illegal  migrants.  As we know the people who came late last year from Turkey, the 14 Turks weren’t  asylum seekers - well they may have sought asylum, there’s some debate about that - but in  any case they turned out not to be refugees at all.  They were simply illegal migrants and were  sent back to Turkey.  That’s where they are now - all of them.   

 Journalist: Now there are suggestions that the surveillance failed in not picking these  people up.   

 Downer: I think we did pick them up.  I think the fact is there are 36,000 kilometres of  Australian coastline.     

 Journalist:  Inaudible.  

 

 Downer: Well we don’t know what their circumstances were.  So I think we would be  able to suspend judgement about that.  The Australian Customs Service boat found them.  So  it’s worked.  They’ve been picked up.  They are being transferred to a naval ship.  I think they  would have by now been transferred to a naval ship, HMAS Cessnock.  And they’ll be  interviewed on board the Cessnock and we’ll get a better idea of who they are.  But the  system’s worked perfectly well.  The Customs boat has picked them up, they’ve been  transferred to a naval vessel.  Because we have vessels in that part of the area we’re able to

 handle this with the greatest of ease.  If the Labor Party makes these suggestions - we’ll take  up the Labor Party’s point here - the Labor Party’s idea is to bring these people immediately  to Australia.  And if these people were illegal migrants, and they had been assisted by people  smugglers, then the people smugglers would have successfully delivered for those people.   And they would be able to go back to other people in Indonesia or wherever and say ‘look, we  got those 15 people into Australia, we can get you in to’.  Now, we don’t operate on that  basis.  We operate on the basis that if people try to come illegally to Australia, courtesy of  people smugglers, they’re not going to make it.  It’s not going to work.  And that’s why we  have had so few of these people come, particularly in the last two and a half years.  Because  we’ve been tough, and we’ve been effective.  But look, in this particular case we don’t know  enough about the people yet to be able to make too many hard and fast judgements.   

 Journalist: If they do fall into that category they won’t be going to Nauru obviously,  they’ll have to ….   

 Downer: They fall into which category?   

 Journalist: As illegal migrants.   

 Downer: If they’re just illegal migrants they’ll go back to Indonesia or wherever they’ve  come from.  As simple as that.  They wouldn’t go to a detention centre.  Alright, I’ll run  through it again.   

 Journalist: If they go into detention they won’t be going to Nauru, they would be coming  to Australia because they arrived at Ashmore Reef.   

 Downer: If these people turn out to be asylum seekers, who have come courtesy of  people smugglers, it is possible, it’s not certain, it’s possible they could go to Nauru for their  applications to be considered.  They could of course go to Christmas Island as well.  It’s  possible they could be sent to Nauru.  But if they are just straight-out illegal migrants and they  don’t apply for asylum, and they come from Indonesia, that’s a possibility.  But in those  circumstances they would just be sent straight back to Indonesia.  Finally, if they’re ship-wrecked people then we’ll have to return them back to their home port somehow.  We’ll  certainly find a way of doing that if that’s the category.   

 Journalist: This announcement to day of the $22.5 million extra.  How much has already  been provided for it?   

 Downer: We would have provided each year slightly different amounts.  This obviously  amounts to an average of $11 million a year because it’s $22.5 million over two years.  I think  in the last year we’ve provided around $13 million.  So it’s slightly less per year than we’ve  provided before.  But look if we didn’t provide this support for Nauru, we wouldn’t be able to  keep power and water going in Nauru.  They simply wouldn’t have any health services there,  or education services.  We just at the end of the day have an obligation to keep Nauru going  and to ensure that the people of Nauru have some livelihood.  But I think it makes sense for us  to sit down with the Government of Nauru and the leaders more broadly in Nauru, and talk  about the long-term future of the country.  The extent to which they have net assets in order  top provide the people of the country with support, and where their cash flow is coming from.

 They’ve generated money mainly from phosphate. And there’s some debate about how much  phosphate there is left in Nauru.(inaudible)  But the fact is it’s going to run out.  It has a very  finite life.   

 Journalist:  Inaudible.  

 

 Downer: Not so much the money they’ve received - we haven’t sent them money, we  run programs.  There’s a different debate.  There’s a debate about what has happened to the  enormous quantities of money that they’ve earned over very many years.  Nauru, not all that  long ago, was in per capita terms one of the richest countries in the world.   

 Journalist:  Minister,  Andrew  Wilkie has decided that he’s going to run against Prime  Minister John Howard in the election.  How do you think his chances will be?   

 Downer: Well he’s running against John Howard in Bennelong.  And he runs as a  Green.  I would have thought in the end, most Australians who favour moderation over excess  would regard a vote for the Greens as a vote for a political party which was an extremist  political party.  So he’ll get some votes, but I don’t think he’ll win.   

 Journalist: But do you think he’ll be a thorn in the Prime Minister’s side?   

 Downer: I don’t think so, no.  I wouldn’t have thought so for a minute.   

 Journalist: What about the polling, internal party polling that we’ve seen today in The  Australian, about people being panicked….   

 Downer: I don’t think that at all.  I think at the end of the day the Government has nine  or ten months to go, whatever it will be until the election.  We’ll just have to wait and see  when the election’s called.  I think we have a very strong foundation for winning the election.   Never has a Government had a better record on economic management than this Government.   It’s been very strong in defence and foreign policy.  It’s been creative in many other areas of  domestic policy.  And when the election comes those things will be the things that count.  Not  gossip.  Because people don’t vote on the basis of gossip or what somebody’s polling may or  may not have showed.  In the great sweep of history, I promise you, there’s a story one day  and it’s wrapping for fish and chips the next.  But the big policy questions are the questions  that the Australian public are influenced by.  They are the issues that will matter when the  election comes.  Bob Hawke - I wouldn’t always agree with Bob Hawke, but he had a great  saying, which is you should never underestimate the intelligence of the Australian people.   And when the election comes I think, it’s going to be the crucial issue - that the public will be  concerned about the great issues of economic management, of national security.  They’ll be  concerned about their own personal security, law and order issues.  They’re not going to be  concerned about what somebody said in some newspaper about some opinion poll.   

 Journalist: Well what do you think the Australian public will think of Peter Costello not  answering whether there’s a leadership challenge?   

 Downer: The public see that sort of thing as political gossip.  I think in the end, the  public know, just as the Parliamentary Party knows, that Peter Costello is simply saying he’s 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 

 

 just not commenting on an issue.  It’s perfectly obvious why he doesn’t comment on it.  He  doesn’t comment on it because there isn’t going to be a change of leadership in the Liberal  Party.  And people know that.  Even people in the press gallery in Canberra know only too  well that we’re not on the eve of a change of leadership in the Liberal Party.  And it’s just not  going to happen.  And so I think political gossip only has a finite life.  Gossip is always a  matter that entertains the Canberra press gallery.  But I think it doesn’t entertain the public to  the extent…   

 Journalist: Will it die as an issue?   

 Downer: I don’t think it’s a big issue, I really don’t.  I don’t think it’s an issue because  there’s no - these things, of course leadership issues as I well know rise from time to time.   But there has to be some foundation for the issue.  There has, in other words, to be a sense  that there is a chance of there being a change of leadership to make it a sustainable and  significant issue, and in this case there’s no prospect of there being a change in the Liberal  Party leadership.  The Parliamentary Party knows that.  The Canberra press gallery knows  that.  And I’m sure the Australian public know that.  The Australian public have enormous  confidence in John Howard.  And he’s done a great job for the country.  And I don’t think  people believe that that is about to change.  And that’s not to diminish what Peter Costello has  done as the Treasurer.  He’s been a tremendous part of the Government team.   

 Journalist:  Inaudible.  

 

 Downer: I think all of us have made it pretty clear that it’s obvious John Howard is  going to lead the Coalition to the next election.  No amount of gossip is going to change that.   

 Journalist: But what do you think - wouldn’t it be easier to stop the gossip by Mr Costello  simply ruling out a challenge?   

 Downer: He’s just saying he’s not talking about the issue.  And the only people who are  talking about it are the media.  It’s a great issue for the media apparently, even though the  media know only too well that there isn’t about to be a change in the leadership of the Liberal  Party.  Everyone knows that.   

 Journalist: What about - obviously it comes down to seats as well - say Chris Gallus’ seat  in Hindmarsh? Are you disappointed she has retired?   

 Downer: I would say two things about that.  I’m disappointed because Chris has been a  great MP. She’s my Parliamentary Secretary.  She’s Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign  Affairs.  And I’ve been very close to her for quite some time.  And she’s been a very popular  local member.  So I’m disappointed that she’s chosen to retire.  But look, everybody has to  retire at some point.  And you can’t expect people just sort of go on and on and on until they  drop dead in politics.  I mean, poor woman, give her a chance.  She’s sixty.  It’s time as she  sees it, and her husband sees it, for her to retire.  And I think it’s entirely understandable.  And  well, nominations close today for the preselection.  I just had a look at the list of the  preselection candidates. It’s a very strong list, and we’ll have a good candidate there and we’ll  have a good chance of winning the seat.   

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 

 

 Journalist: Who would you support?   

 Downer: Whichever one is the winner.  I’ll be supporting the winner.  And the reason I  say that is not just to be glib.  We actually don’t do a factional deal to decide who’s going to  win it.  The only way you can win a preselection in the Liberal Party is to get the local people,  local members of the Liberal Party to support you.  There’s no deal that’s going to be  concocted in Canberra or on Greenhill Road, which is where the Liberal Party’s head office  is.  You can’t concoct a candidate out of that.  You’ve got to get the local people, the local  branch members to support people, support candidates.  And anyway, whoever they decide  they want to as their candidate will get my 100 per cent support.   

 Journalist: …given she had the highest personal rating..enormous personal support?   

 Downer: She had a high personal rating and she’s been a popular and hard working  member.  Look everybody has a right one day to retire.  Even people in politics. They are  either going to be defeated, retire, or die in office.  One of those three things is going to  happen.  And if I could put it to you, out of those three choices, I would choose retirement.  And Chris did choose retirement.  Whether I’ll be able to get my wish remains to be seen.   

 Journalist: …revert to being a marginal seat?   

 Downer: It’s a marginal seat.  I mean it’s not going to revert to be - it is a marginal seat.   And she’s done extraordinarily well to hold that seat since I think 1990.  But she’s done an  extraordinary job.  On the other hand, the Liberal Party loses the advantage of incumbency  there - nevertheless a good candidate, a good strong campaign, an election that’s fought on  the issues, the Government’s record and what the Government offers for the future in terms of  economic and national security stability - I think we have a good chance of holding it.  But it  won’t be easy.   

 Journalist: This is seen as one of the toughest elections for the Liberals ...with Mark  Latham now as Leader and criticism about the war?   

 Downer: I think in the case of the Iraq War, most people think that we went to war and  we won.  And we overthrew Saddam Hussein’s regime and that’s a great thing.  Now the anti-war lobby are out there trying to revisit history, trying to recreate scandals and whatever it  may be.  And I think the more they go on about it the better for us.  Because the more it gives  us the opportunity to remind people that we did go to war against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq.  We  won.  And we are proud of the fact that we overthrew Saddam Hussein’s regime.  And if the  anti-war lobby had their way, then Saddam Hussein would still be strutting the streets and the  palaces of Baghdad.  We’re happy to have that debate with anybody.  And I think the public  understand that. I think it explains why the Labor Party spokesman on Foreign Affairs, who is  a Mr Kevin Rudd, why I think he might have asked me only one question on Iraq and  weapons of mass destruction since June the 23rd last year.  So, I don’t think they want to  concentrate on that issue too much, as a matter of fact.  Some commentators do, but I think for  the Government, we’re happy to have that debate every day of the week.  And overall, well the next election will be tough.  The last election was tough.  The 1998  election - the result of that was extraordinarily close.  Remember in the two party preferred  terms, not the basis on which elections are fought - they’re fought seat by seat, but in two

 party preferred terms across the country Labor got more votes than the Coalition in the 1998  election.  So they’re always tough.  There’s no such thing as an easy election in Federal  politics.  State politics it can happen, as you just saw in Queensland.   

 Journalist: How do you feel about your own seat?   

 Downer: Well it’ll be tough.  It’s always tough.  And there’ll be strong candidates that  will run against me.  And I’ll just do my best.  I’m hopeful that I’ll be able to win again but  you never know.  I don’t take it for granted and I’ve been already out there campaigning and  making sure that I have the best chance of being able to win.  But, no I think it’ll be close and  it’ll be difficult but I’ll just do my best.   

 Journalist: Are we going to see any ads on television with images of September 11 in  New York and battlefields in Iraq like Bush’s?   

 Downer: I don’t think we’ll be running President Bush’s ads…no reflection…I haven’t  seen them.  You in the media have had the morning to look at them. I haven’t.  I’ve been  working.   You’ve been working as well but different sort of work.  So we will have some ads  when the election comes.  I’ll give you that forecast.  But what they’ll be, I guess they haven’t  been considered and designed yet.  It’s a bit far away.  Remember we’ve still got a quarter of  the Parliamentary term left.  And a lot of things will happen between now and the time the  election is called.  There’ll be a lot of events that occur that you just can’t, and I can’t 

 anticipate.  We just have no idea what is going to happen over the next 7 or 8 months before  the election is called.  So we’ll wait and see.  All elections are tough though.  That’s why we  enjoy them, enjoy the challenge.
