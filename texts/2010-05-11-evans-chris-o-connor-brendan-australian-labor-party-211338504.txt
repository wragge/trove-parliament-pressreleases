 Senator Chris Evans  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 Budget 2010-11—Strengthening Australia's  border security  Joint media release with Brendan O'Connor - Minister for  Home Affairs 

 Tuesday, 11 May 2010 

 The Australian Government will invest $1.2 billion to bolster Australia's border  security with a range of measures including eight new border patrol vessels and  strengthened aviation security. 

 The measures underscore the Government's commitment to securing Australia's  borders and airports, screening incoming passengers who may be a security risk,  and boosting our engagement with our regional partners. 

 Protecting Australia's borders from threats of terrorism, people smuggling, organised  crime, including the trafficking of illicit goods and illegal foreign fishing, is a top  priority for investment by the Rudd Government. 

 The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that Australia's law  enforcement and border agencies have the best possible capability to confidently  respond to existing and emerging threats to our border security. 

 The measures include: 

 Border and Aviation Security 

 â¢ $69.4 million over four years to introduce  biometric checks of international passengers in  overseas posts to strengthen Australia's  capacity to verify the identity of foreign nationals 

 â¢ $24.9 million for Stage 2, Enhanced Passenger  Assessment and Clearance (EPAC) to ensure a  larger number of passengers can be assessed  faster and earlier and to ensure that travel  histories can be collected for the purpose of  identifying passengers who may pose security  risks 

 â¢ $11.4 million over four years for the Next  Generation Border Security Initiative to allow the  Department of Immigration and Citizenship to  undertake advanced data analysis and risk  profiling to more effectively identify visa  applicants who may represent national security  risks for referral to ASIO 

 â¢ $9.2 million over four years to continue to  support and maintain the Regional Movement  Alert System (RMAS) which enables automatic  verification of passports issued by each  participating country 

 â¢ $17.8 million additional funding over four years  to increase the number of Australian Federal  Police firearms and explosive detector dogs at  major international airports 

 â¢ $759.4 million will be provided over four years  for continued policing at Australian airports as  part of the Government's commitment to  strengthened aviation security 

 â¢ $12.3 million additional funding for one year in  2010-11 for the Australian Federal Police  presence at 11 major airports, in line with the  Beale review's recommendations on airport  policing to deliver more responsive and better  coordinated policing at these vital gateways. 

 Border Protection 

 â¢ A major investment in the purchase of eight new  patrol vessels with improved surveillance and  response capability and greater range, to  replace the current ageing Bay Class vessels.  The Government will also provide additional  funding of around $42.6 million over four years  to meet project implementation and enhanced  operating costs 

 â¢ $163.2 million over four years to continue  initiatives to combat illegal foreign fishing  â¢ $32.9 million over four years for investment in  work with Indonesia to better manage the issue 

 of people smuggling within Indonesia and the  region  â¢ $15.7 million over two years to ensure the  continued presence of a dedicated vessel at 

 Ashmore Reef  â¢ $800 000 additional funding over two years to  the Commonwealth Ombudsman to ensure the 

 fairness of detention and immigration processes  on Christmas Island. 

 The new Customs patrol vessels will be able to travel further than the existing craft  and the capacity to conduct operations in all parts of Australia's waters. The first  vessel is expected to come on line in 2012-13 with the full new fleet being  operational by 2015-16. 

 Additional funding for the management of irregular migration in Indonesia will help  improve conditions and security in immigration detention centres and enable the  UNHCR to provide faster refugee status determinations. A network of outreach  offices will be funded to help Indonesian authorities better manage irregular  migration flows and people smuggling activities. 

 The measure recognises the pressures on Indonesia as a transit country for people  seeking to enter Australia without a valid visa or seeking asylum. 

 The collection of biometric data will substantially improve verification of the identity of  foreign nationals seeking to enter Australia by obtaining fingerprints and facial  images from visa applications in 10 overseas posts. 

 The measures announced in the 2010 Budget build on the $654 million border  protection and anti people smuggling package in the 2009 Budget.
