 TURNBULL DOORSTOP - THE RUDD GOVERNMENT’S RECKLESS  SPENDING AND BORROWING, CONGESTION TAX, ETS, BORDER  PROTECTION, ASYLUM SEEKERS 

 The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP  

 Leader of the Opposition 

 E&OE  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well Australians are starting to pay the price for Labor’s reckless spending and borrowing. We’re seeing higher 

 interest rates and yesterday the Reserve Bank Governor, in his strongest and most forthright statement about 

 future rate rises, saying he would not be timid about winding back the monetary stimulus that he provided quickly 

 by reducing rates.  

 So Glenn Stevens is saying he is going to respond to the changed economic conditions by quickly putting rates 

 up again. And we’ve seen Ken Henry, the Treasury Secretary, out canvassing new taxes, in this case a 

 congestion tax. We saw in the Parliament not so long ago the Government refusing to confirm or deny that they 

 were contemplating new taxes on the family home.  

 At the beginning of this year we said that Labor’s borrowing and spending, reckless borrowing and spending, 

 would mean higher interest rates and higher taxes. And those economic chickens are coming home to roost for 

 Mr Rudd because we’re starting to see both. And yet last night the Finance Minister, Mr Tanner, said that the rate 

 of spending would not be slowed.  

 So at the same time as the Reserve Bank Governor, recognising the economic strength in our nation, our 

 growing economy, is winding back the monetary stimulus by increasing interest rates, the Federal Government is 

 fuelling that growth, pushing up interest rates by continuing to spend unabated and the consequence of that is 

 going to be higher interest rates and higher taxes.  

 If Mr Rudd won’t listen to the Opposition who warned of this at the beginning of the year, if he won’t listen to 

 young home buyers who are anxious about paying higher interest rates, and if he won’t listen to the Governor of 

 the Reserve Bank Glenn Stevens, when will he start listening and stop this reckless spending?  

 QUESTION:  

 What’s your position on the idea of a congestion tax?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well a congestion tax is not a good idea. It can only be feasible in circumstances where there is a readily 

 available public transport alternative. I mean it could only ever be equitable in those circumstances. And you take 

 a city like Sydney, which probably has the best public transport of the major cities in Australia, and there are vast 

 areas of Sydney which have little or no public transport availability.  

 So a congestion tax in the absence of a widespread public transport network, as you have in London, would be 

 very, very unjust and that’s why we would not agree to it.  

 QUESTION:  

 On a different note, do you have any comments to make on the emissions trading scheme and the call for a 

 secret ballot in the party on that?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 We don’t have secret ballots on policy matters in the party room, it’s not our practice.  

 QUESTION:  

 Are you concerned about a leadership spill on Sunday?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 No.  

 QUESTION:  

 You don’t think it’s on the agenda and you don’t think…  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 No, it isn’t. It isn’t and I’m not.  

 QUESTION:  

 On another matter again, do you support Kevin Andrews’ idea of a new temporary protection visa system for 

 asylum seekers?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Let me just say this about the asylum seekers and the situation at the moment. Unlike Mr Rudd I did see the 

 pleas of the little girl on the boat in Indonesia and it was heart-breaking. Every Australian who saw those people 

 would have been deeply moved by it.  

 But the tragedy is that she and her parents were invited on to that boat by a people smuggler, by someone who 

 believed that because Mr Rudd had softened our border protection policies they would be able to promise to 

 those unfortunate passengers a certain passage to Australia.  

 So the reality is that Mr Rudd unpicked the fabric of a border protection policy that had worked, that had proved 

 its effectiveness by substantially eliminating this vile trade of people smuggling. And Mr Rudd can talk about 

 being hardline and tough and making no apologies as often as he likes, but the apology he should make is to the 

 Australian people because he unpicked a policy, a suite of policies that had worked and had proved their 

 effectiveness because the boats had stopped.  

 He said by changing those policies it would have no effect on the boats, nothing would change. He said we’d be 

 able to eliminate those policies of the Howard Government and we’d still have no boats - and yet we now have 

 nearly 2,000 arrivals, illegal arrivals since he changed the policy - with the expectation that there will be 

 thousands more.  

 This is a comprehensive failure in policy. Mr Rudd has recklessly opened up our borders in a way that is placing 

 the integrity of our whole immigration system and our whole program, our generous program of humanitarian 

 assistance, at risk. He must recognise that he has failed the Australian people and he must hold an urgent inquiry 

 into the situation, getting the utmost intelligence advice, specialist advice, both from the region and domestically, 

 to examine the impact of his policies and what measures can be put in place to rectify this problem.  

 There is no quick fix to this. Mr Rudd has recklessly unpicked a suite of policies which worked and there is no 

 silver bullet to resolve the situation in a moment.  

 QUESTION:  

 There’s not a quick fix but there’s a very immediate crisis with the Sri Lankans now refusing to take food. What do 

 you think we should do? What action should we take?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 The Sri Lankans are on board a vessel in an Indonesian port so it is quite properly and factually the responsibility 

 of the Indonesians.  

 The hunger strike is a reckless and self-destructive act, it is putting lives at risk and I have no doubt the 

 Indonesian authorities will be doing - just as we would be doing if the boat was in an Australian port - doing 

 everything they can to ensure that the hunger strike comes to an end by persuading the hunger strikers to stop 

 and by ensuring that they leave the vessel peacefully and then can be dealt with and processed in the usual way 

 by the UN High Commission on Refugees.  

 QUESTION:  

 They are saying they won’t back down though until they can come to Australia so really it is partly our problem 

 too, isn’t it?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well, look, there are not thousands, there are millions of people who would like to come to Australia and who 

 could claim the asylum status as refugees, millions of people, and we have a very generous humanitarian 

 program, one of the most generous in the world relative to the size of our population. But it is fundamental that 

 we choose the refugees that we admit into Australia based on criteria, our criteria - in particular, criteria of those 

 that are in the greatest need.  

 We cannot have a humanitarian program which is self-selecting. We take 13,000 a year in total. We have already 

 had 2,000 illegal arrivals since last August. If that became 4,000 or 5,000, you can readily see that the program, 

 the quota if you like, the number, becomes more and more filled out by people smugglers.  

 You cannot outsource your humanitarian program, your humanitarian refugee program to the people smuggling 

 industry. That is not in Australia’s interest and it isn’t in the interest of the thousands and indeed millions of 

 refugees who are seeking Australia’s assistance. We cannot help everyone. We help a large number, a large 

 number particularly relative to other countries, so we are generous but we have to be able to make those 

 judgments. We cannot allow Mr Rudd to outsource our humanitarian program to the people smugglers.  

 Thanks very much.
