 MEDIA RELEASE â AUSTRALIAN GREENS   Greens Congratulate Dr. Cynthia Maung on  Sydney Peace Prize  

 Australian Greens Senator Scott Ludlam, spokesperson on Burma, 21  August 2013    

 Senator Scott Ludlam visited the clinic Dr. Cynthia Maung founded on the Thai Burma  border in 2010 and 2012.    

 “The Sydney Peace Foundation have made an excellent choice in honouring Dr. Cynthia  Maung with the Sydney Peace Prize.  I look forward to congratulating her personally at  the 6 November lecture and 7 November award ceremony,” said Senator Scott Ludlam,  Greens spokesperson on Burma.      

 “Dr. Maung’s Mae Tao clinic was established in 1988 with a handful of medical  professionals in two small buildings.  It is now a large complex that treats 150,000 people  living on the Thai-Burma border per year with 700 staff, including visiting specialists  from all over the world.    

 “The Mae Tao clinic provides health care and hope for those who do not receive any  services from their own government or aid efforts channelled through Rangoon cannot  reach.    

 “Dr. Maung travelled to Canberra in 2009 to inform policy makers about the crisis in the  eastern part of Burma and the need for aid to be channelled to people in need.     

 “She convinced the Greens that change was needed.  We joined with many civil society  and aid organisations to push the government to change its cross border aid policy  which it finally did in 2012.     

 “Unfortunately in 2013 the government diverted some of the aid budget to Burma to pay  for its expensive and indefensible policy of indefinitely detaining asylum seekers, slicing  a quarter of its support to Dr. Maung’s clinic.   

 “The Greens believe the Burmese people are not yet free from the grip of the brutal  military regime that has controlled Burma since 1962 due to a deeply flawed pro-military constitution that allows the military control of the parliament, resources and  state functions.     

 “Human rights violations including military attacks on ethnic groups are ongoing and  hundreds of political prisoners languish in Burmese jails.  While this remains the case, 

 Australian businesses should not be profiting on the misery of the Burmese people,”  Senator Ludlam concluded.
