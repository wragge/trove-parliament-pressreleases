 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON KIM C BEAZLEY MP   

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, BOX HILL SOUTH, MELBOURNE,   4 APRIL 2006   

 E & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:     Nuisance Phone Calls; Industrial Relations; Medibank Private;  Indonesian/Australia tensions; Uranium; Taiwan   

 BEAZLEY:  We’re here to claim victory today, in particular, to claim  victory for Anna Burke.  We have secured, from Helen Coonan, the relevant  Minister, a great backflip, and that is getting rid of nuisance calls from Australian  households.  Anna has got every reason to claim victory.  We have been  advocating this for three years now.  She’s had a Private Member’s Bill in the  Parliament for six months and finally now, the Minister acts.     

 We welcome this backflip but we ask this question.  Why is the Minister not going  to implement this until 2007?  That means despite the fact the Minister has taken  welcome steps to remove nuisance calls, Australian households are still going to  get a billion of them between now and when the cut-off point is finally reached.   But nevertheless, it’s a very good victory for us to have the Minister, after  repudiating our suggestion, finally changing her mind.     

 We want to change her mind on something else, too.  Now that she’s done it on  nuisance calls, she can do it to get pornography off the screens of kids using our  computers, when they use the net.  We want a clean feed for all Australian  households with the service providers obliged to get rid of the pornography  unless somebody deliberately decides to opt in.  Our kids are entitled, and our  parents are entitled to expect that what they get on their computer screens,  through the net, is wholly useful to them and is not shocking and pornographic.     

 She said that was impossible, too.  Well, having said it was impossible on the  nuisance calls and changing her mind, she can now change her mind on that.     

 There is one other thing I want to talk about which is unrelated to this but a story  from today then I’ll be very happy to take your questions.     

 Overnight, a lawyer who was responsible, or one of those responsible, for  drafting the Industrial Relations laws for Freehills has had something to say on  the Industrial Relations bills.     

 What Freehills, the drafter of the bills said, is this: “… that the protection of the  workers under this legislation is all smoke and mirrors”.  Well, we agree it is all  smoke and mirrors.  There is no protection for Australian workers now in the  Government’s legislation.  That’s why I’m going to rip it up and put in place a  system of fairness that protects the rights and protects the job security of  Australians.  It’s another day, another horror story in the saga of the Howard  Government’s ideologically blind pursuit of ordinary workers’ living standards  through their industrial relations legislation.     

 Now I’m going to give Anna a word to claim victory herself.   

 BURKE:  I just want to say thank you to Helen Coonan for finally  seeing sense, but it’s taken her too long.  Something needed to be done sooner.   Families can’t wait until 2007.  She said it was impossible, she said it was too  hard, she said it was too costly, and the day we’re going to make our  announcement, at 8.20 this morning she puts out a press release.  Well, it  obviously isn’t too hard, it isn’t too complicated, and she should have done it  before now to save families from the annoyance of these calls.  So,  congratulations and thanks, but it’s our victory - she’s taken our policy.   

 BEAZLEY:  And 2007 is too late.  She should do it now.   

 JOURNALIST: Why wait until 2007?   

 BEAZLEY:  I cannot fathom why she would do that.  Quite frankly, this is  something that you could do in very short order.  We’ve got Parliament sitting  again, what, in about four or five week’s time, you could put the legislation  through.  We’d give it urgent passage.  We could have this in place in a couple of  months.  Instead, we’ve got to wait until 2007.  There is no reason.   

 JOURNALIST: How do you feel about the possible sale of Medibank  Private?  What are your thoughts on that?   

 BEAZLEY:  The Government should not do it.  Medibank Private belongs  to those of us who are members of it.  I happen to be a member of it.  I signed up  in no small part due to the fact that it was a government-owned entity.  That’s 

 one of the reasons why I took that decision.  Before they do anything on it, they  owe it to the people who are the policy holders to talk to them.  They failed to do  that.   

 

 JOURNALIST: Is there a concern if the government-owned entity isn’t there  keeping prices down that private companies will just let prices skyrocket even  more than they are now? 

 

 BEAZLEY:  There’s all of that.  There’s also a sense of security, I think,  for many Australians that when they went into a product that they were very 

 cautious about, because they’re very cautious about private health insurance,  there was some certainty, some guarantee by virtue of the fact the Government  was in the industry.  Now, the Government just said willy-nillly it wants to pull out.   Well, quite frankly, if they’re going to sell Medibank Private, they ought to talk to  the people who are, in effect, the policy holders in it.   

 JOURNALIST: On the issue of Indonesia, we’ve seen tensions further  increase overnight.  How do you think Australia’s relationship with Indonesia  stands at the moment? 

 

 BEAZLEY:  Well, this is a serious problem.  Now, we supported the  Government in the arms-length process which determined people’s refugee  status - we did that.  But Alexander Downer is out there saying that we can all sit  back and relax on this one and it doesn’t matter all that much.  It matters a lot.   Border security is not something that you take lightly and, quite frankly, Howard  and Downer have got to start to earn their money and get our relationship back  on an even keel.   

 JOURNALIST: How would you do that?  What are you suggesting they do?   

 BEAZLEY:  Part of the problem is who they are, you know.  Howard and  Downer have, over the years, made a huge song and dance of the fact that they  determined who came into this country. And they did it largely for political  reasons, but the Indonesians believed them, that’s the point.  Now, when they  started saying that that’s what they were doing, the Indonesians believed that  they had absolute control over it, or wanted absolute control over it.  So, now  they are hoist with their own petard, frankly, but we’re all hoist along with them.     

 They’re going to have to redouble their efforts to explain in very great detail the  fact that they didn’t quite mean what they said during that election campaign and  that we did appreciate what the Indonesians did, and the megaphone that we  took out on them, when we put in place the original policy of keeping refugees  away from our borders, had the intention ultimately that they’d end up in  Australia.  So, the policy that applied to them also applied to the people from  West Irian.  So, what Howard and Downer have got to do now is get out and do a  bit of work.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, now Australia’s signed the uranium deal with  China, should we go about opening more mines?   

 BEAZLEY;  I think that the Australian people are very cautious about the  nuclear industry, very cautious about all aspects of it - nuclear power, exports of  uranium, proliferation of weapons.  From the Labor Party’s point of view, as we  review our policy on this, we have the time and the opportunity to hasten slowly  and get it right.  That’s what we’ve got to do in anything that we do with our policy  in this area, we have to get it right.  There is one urgent problem, and that’s non-

 proliferation. Urgent, as we can see, with the situation in Korea and the situation  in Iran.  We have put out very detailed policy on that and the Government ought  to be taking note of what we’ve suggested.   

 But in terms of the mines, well, what we now know about the production at  Olympic Dam, what we know is there available from Honeymoon, there’s more  than enough uranium on offer to fill the Chinese orders.  So, we’ve got enough  out there for the current levels of demand.  We’ve got time to get the policy right.   I will not be pressured by John Howard’s fake urgency on this matter.  We know  what John Howard’s up to.  He’s about a nuclear power industry for this country  and that’s an entirely different matter, as far as we’re concerned.   

 JOURNALIST: How much of a concern is the Cowra Abattoir dispute?   

 BEAZLEY:  It’s of enormous concern.  Here we see what Freehills was  talking about - the protection for workers is “smoke and mirrors”.  Under John  Howard’s legislation, your workforce can be sacked then re-employed at a cut  rate.  There are all sorts of other tricks they can get up to, too.  They can get out  there now and look around, see what workers are available to work for 20 per  cent less than what you’re prepared to work for, and then sack you as soon as  they’ve brought them on board.  We saw that in the Triangle Cables issue a week  or so ago.  We’re getting an issue a week of people who are being unfairly  dismissed and having their job security threatened.  Now, Howard is out there  saying that this is possibly a breach of their laws.  No, it’s not, unfortunately.  But  it will be a breach of the ones I’ll put in place.   

 JOURNALIST: Back to uranium, how do you feel about uranium being sold  to Taiwan?   

 BEAZLEY:  That’s one of the surprises, I think, that the Australian people  got today.  The situation in Taiwan is that they were signatories to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  They were once members of it when they were in the United  Nations.  Now, they’re being removed from the United Nations but they still  conform rigorously to the terms of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  I suppose that’s  reflected by the fact that the Chinese, who, of course, have a very strong  argument in relation to Taiwan, or with the Taiwanese often, are quite relaxed  about the sale of uranium to that Territory.   

 

 So, I think, given the fact that they signed up to rigorous standards, I think, given  the fact that they are implementing rigorous standards, then it’s acceptable.  But  it, nevertheless, shows how much more detailed thinking we need to give about  non-proliferation issues when something like this pops up overnight.
