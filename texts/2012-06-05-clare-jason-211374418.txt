 ANOTHER BOAT AFTER ABBOTT VOTES AGAINST  OFFSHORE PROCESSING   

 Another asylum seeker boat was intercepted today as a direct consequence of Tony Abbottâs  decision to vote against offshore processing, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship,  Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said today.   

 Last week Tony Abbott voted against legislation to implement offshore processing.   

 The boat is the 44th since Tony Abbott rejected the Governmentâs offer to work together to  implement offshore processing.   

 Mr Bowen said the difference in boat numbers from May last year and May this year  highlighted the positive effect of the Malaysia arrangement on reducing asylum seeker  arrivals in Australia.   

 “In May 2011, after the Malaysia arrangement was announced, we had a total of we had a  total of six boat arrivals with 304 asylum seekers, as people knew there was no guarantee of  resettlement in Australia,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “In contrast, in May this year we had 14 boats with 1,176 asylum seekers arrive. This shows  that the Coalitionâs wrongheadedness on this issue is encouraging boats to come to our  shores.”   

 Mr Clare said it was time Tony Abbott stopped voting ânoâ and allowed offshore processing in  Malaysia and Nauru.   

 “Let's remember what this is all about - 200 people died off the coast of Indonesia and  another 11 died off the coast of Malaysia,” Mr Clare said.   

 “We can help stop people dying at sea. It requires legislation. That means it requires us to  work together.”
