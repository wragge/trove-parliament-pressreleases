 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 RUDDOCK RESPONDS TO LABOR’S CALL FOR INDEPENDENT EXPERTS TO VISIT WOOMERA

 The Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration, Julia Gillard, today welcomed Minister Ruddock’s decision to have the Independent Detention Advisory Committee visit the Woomera Detention Centre.

 Yesterday, Labor called on the Minister to allow independent experts to visit Woomera and to publicly report on how many asylums seekers are involved in a hunger strike, how many have sewn their lips together, in what way children are involved, what other acts of self harm have occurred and what are the main issues motivating asylum seekers to engage in such conduct.

 Minister Ruddock has responded to this call by arranging for the Independent Advisory Committee to visit Woomera today.

 It is vital that the Committee be allowed to publicly report its findings from the visit.  The public is entitled to know precisely what is going on rather than being caught in a cycle of claim and counter claim.

 Labor calls on Minister Ruddock to facilitate public reporting by the Committee.

 In addition, Labor reiterates its call that on an on-going basis medical services in detention centres should be provided by independent medical professionals who are free to publicly report on detention centre issues.

 Tuesday 22 January 2002
