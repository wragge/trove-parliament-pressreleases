 Greens demand halt to WA technology aiding  Burmese military repression   Media Release | Spokesperson Scott Ludlam   Tuesday 5th January 2010, 3:40pm 

 in Burma   

 The Australian Greens are calling on the Commonwealth to immediately freeze the supply of Australian 

 radio encryption technology to the Burmese military.  

 

 Senator Scott Ludlam, who has just travelled to the Thai-Burma border to meet pro-democracy 

 campaigners and refugees, says the scandal underlines the need for an immediate review of the loose 

 Australian sanctions regime. 

 

 According to monitors of the sanction-shrouded country the radio sets, made and supplied by Barrett 

 Communications of Perth, have been deployed in recent months to help the Burmese Army's brutal wars 

 against ethnic minorities and pro-democracy forces.  

 

 "I find it unconscionable that we should allow Australian companies to aid and abet this regime's repressive

 crackdown ahead of the sham 2010 election," said Senator Ludlam.  

 

 "Foreign Minister Stephen Smith must explain why military-grade communications equipment isn't caught 

 up in our arms embargo.  All shipments of this equipment must be frozen while our sanctions regime is 

 reviewed. 

 

 "The tide is turning against the brutality of Burma's regime and Australia should be leading that chorus, not 

 aiding it with the transfer of vital technology," he concluded.
