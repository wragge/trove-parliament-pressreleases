  Media Release  Senator the Hon Amanda Vanstone  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

  129.06 Tuesday 23 May 2006 

  Strike rate improves on 90-day protection commitment 

  As promised, both the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) and the  Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) continue to process more Protection Visa applications  within the 90-day time limit. 

  The second statutory report by DIMA on Protection Visa Processing Taking More than 90  Days for the Reporting Period 1 November 2005 to 28 February 2006, was tabled in  Parliament today 

  “The report shows my department has successfully continued to clear applications for  further protection visas and has significantly improved its processing times for people  applying for protection for the first time, in accordance with the Government’s commitment  of June 17 last year,” Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone,  said. 

  “Of the 504 applications finalised in more than 90 days, 472 of those were delayed for  reasons outside the department’s control. 

  “Of the 763 applications that were not finalised, 758 were attributed to factors outside the  department’s control.” 

  The RRT has cross-appointed members of the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) as part of  its commitment to meeting the 90-day deadline. 

  The second report on the RRT indicates a significant reduction of reviews being finalised  outside the 90-day requirement. According to the report, 67 per cent of the 1122 reviews  being finalised in the reporting period were completed within the required timeframe. 

  “The tribunal has made significant progress in bringing down the number of cases on hand  - 523 cases were active before the tribunal at the time of this report, down from 1146  active cases at July 31, 2005,” Senator Vanstone said. 

  “This reduction is due to the virtual elimination of a significant backlog and provides a way  forward to speedier reviews. 

  “At May 12, 2006 there was one case on hand that was older than 12 months, one case  older than nine months and 22 cases between six and nine months old. This indicates that  the tribunal is succeeding in meeting the requirement that reviews be finalised within 90  days.”
