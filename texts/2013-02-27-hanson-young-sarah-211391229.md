 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 27 February 2013   

 Visa freeze not the answer   

 The opposition’s attempt to link an alleged indecent assault to refugees living in the community is  irresponsible, the Australian Greens said today.   

 “It‘s clear that indecent assault is unacceptable and I am concerned for the young woman involved,”  the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said today.   

 “An appropriate response to this incident is to let the legal system deal with it, it is a matter to be  left to the courts.   

 “A freeze on refugees living in the community is not a practical response and any review of bridging  visas should be used as an opportunity to give people back their right to work so that they can be  self-sufficient.   

 “A lot of the difficulties surrounding the housing of refugees, including the shortage of available  accommodation, could be answered by letting these skilled people work.”
