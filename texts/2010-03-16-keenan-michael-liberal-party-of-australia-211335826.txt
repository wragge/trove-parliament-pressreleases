 Rudd runs and hides as Darwin prepares for first arrivals   

 Tuesday, 16 March 2010 

 

 The Rudd Government used its numbers in Parliament today to silence a debate on the  current state of Australia’s border protection system, following reports that asylum  seekers will now be processed on Australia’s mainland.  

 

 Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection was denied the opportunity  to participate in a fair, informed debate over how Australia’s border protection had  reached crisis point when the Government called for the debate to be ended.  

 

 “The Government is continuing to run and hide on this issue, instead of facing up to the  Australian people and explaining how they have let us get to a position where we are  seeing 6 boats arrive in 8 days,” said Mr Keenan.    

 “Today’s reports that more boats are on their ways, and that their passengers will be  processed in Darwin, are an inevitable consequence of the Rudd Labor Government’s soft  policy,   “There is no doubt that people smugglers use Rudd’s ‘with open arms’ policy in their  sales pitch to potential boat people,    

 “If the Government doesn’t act now, the boats will continue to come and in greater  numbers,
