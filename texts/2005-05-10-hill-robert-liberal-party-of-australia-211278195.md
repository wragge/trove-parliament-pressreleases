 FIRST ARMIDALE CLASS PATROL BOAT ARRIVES   

 The first of the Armidale Class Patrol Boats being used to protect Australia’s  northern coastline will arrive in Darwin today after completing most of its mission  trial, Defence Minister Robert Hill announced today. 

 NUSHIP ARMIDALE, which was designed and built in Australia, is the first of 12  Armidale Class Patrol Bboats to have advanced systems and excellent sea-keeping  capability for coastal surveillance and protecting Australia’s coastline.   

 Senator Hill said these vessels will replace the Navy’s Fremantle Class Patrol Boats.   

 “This project is demonstrating the ability of Australian industry to design, construct  and deliver an important class of ships for the Navy on time, on budget and with  excellent capability,” Senator Hill said. 

 “The Armidale Class Patrol Boats are at the leading edge of international patrol boat  design and construction, combining endurance, improved sea-keeping and  advanced onboard systems,” Senator Hill said. 

 Defence Maritime Services (DMS) subcontracted Austal Ships to build the vessels at  its Henderson shipyard in Western Australia. As well as the supply of 12 ships, the  contract with DMS also provides for integrated maintenance, logistic and crew-training support to the vessels throughout their operational lives.   

 This first boat was launched on 5 January 2005 and formally named NUSHIP  ARMIDALE on 22 January.  Since that time NUSHIP ARMIDALE has been  undergoing extensive harbour and sea trials.   

 The mission trial is the final activity under this trial program, which saw the vessel  sailing from Henderson, Western Australia on 22 April 2005, initially undertaking a  passage to 40 degrees south to test the ship and procedures in cold and potentially  rough environments before sailing north with port calls in Dampier and Broome.   

 “In effect the vessel has been tested for its ability to conduct surveillance, patrol  and response operations in Australia’s Maritime Jurisdictional Zones,” Senator Hill  said. 

 “The prime contractor, project officers and military personnel have all been involved  in the mission trial, which demonstrates the boat’s suitability for operational use  against the requirements in the ship build and support contract.   

 “Over the coming week DMS will fine tune equipment and systems following the  trial, prior to presentation to the Commonwealth for formal acceptance on 17 May  2005.”   

 Following acceptance from the contractor, NUSHIP ARMIDALE will formally be  commissioned as an operational ship of the Royal Australian Navy at a ceremony in  Darwin on 24 June 2005.  She will then undergo crew evaluation before  commencing operational patrols to protect Australia’s borders.

 Following the completion of the design work in early 2004, the production work  began in April 2004.  Construction of the second and third Armidale Class Boats is  progressing well and the construction of follow-on boats has commenced.
