  RUDDOCK CLARIFIES EVENTS SURROUNDING  THE RESCUE OF SURVIVORS BY MV TAMPA 

  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, refuted claims  that Australia was responsible for organising the rescue of the unauthorised boat  arrivals currently aboard the container ship, Tampa. 

  “There has been a lot of public comment recently that Australia is responsible for  landing these unauthorised boat arrivals on the basis that we co-ordinated and took  responsibility for the search and rescue effort,” he said. 

  “It was the Indonesian Search and Rescue Authority that accepted its responsibility  for coordinating the rescue of the unauthorised boat arrivals by Tampa. Consistent  with normal international search and rescue procedures, the Australian Search and  Rescue authority, AusSAR, issued a distress relay to shipping in the vicinity. 

  Mr Ruddock described the sequence of events leading up to the rescue: 

  SATURDAY 2!jTH AUGUST  3.45pm, Coastwatch advised the Australian Search and Rescue (AusSAR) of a  sighting of a vessel 55 nautical miles west-northwest of Christmas Island. The  vessel appeared to have in excess of 80 people on board and seemed to be 

  “dead in the water”. 

  6.30pm. AusSAR received a further report from the Coastwatch aircraft that the  35 metre Indonesian vessel was apparently broken down and drifting north-west  of Christmas Island, well inside the Indonesian search and rescue region.  Coastwatch estimated some 200 people or more on board and the vessel 

  appeared to be in distress. 

  7.00pm. As the vessel was located in the Indonesian search and rescue area,  details were passed to the Indonesian Search and Rescue Authority in Jakarta  for coordination. 

  SUNDAY 26 AUGUST  12.30pm. Airservices Australia relayed a message to AusSAR from a  Coastwatch aircraft that the vessel was now displaying “SOS” and “HELP” signs  on the cabin roof. AusSAR contacted the Defence Attache at the Australian 

  Embassy in Jakarta who arranged for information about the vessel to be passed  on to the Indonesian Search and Rescue Authority. AusSAR sent another  facsimile asking Indonesia to accept coordination of the rescue. 

  At around 2.00 pm the Indonesian Search and Rescue Authority confirmed  by telephone that the fax had been received and that Indonesia has  accepted coordination of the incident.

  In accordance with normal procedures, AusSAR issued a distress relay at  around 1 .OO pm to shipping in the area. Several merchant ships, including  Tampa, responded. 

  At 1.45 pm the Tampa Captain advised that it had altered course in response to  the distress relay. The ship was asked to coordinate further action with the  Indonesian Search and Rescue Authority. 

  9.40 pm. The Tampa Captain advised that he had arrived at the vessel at 5.30  pm and embarked 434 survivors which had taken about 2 hours. 

  At the same time, the Captain also advised that on the advice of the Indonesian  Search and Rescue Authority he was proceeding to the port of Merak on Java  to disembark the survivors. 

  The ship was steaming towards Indonesia when it advised AusSAR that five  survivors "strongly expressed their desire that they all be taken to Christmas  Island, and nowhere else." The master advised AusSAR that he was changing  course to Christmas Island "in the interest of the safety of my crew". 

  Monday 27 August  6.00pm The Indonesian SAR Authority advised Rescue Coordination Centre  Australia that "MV Tampa is proceeding to Merak and will arrive at 0600 on  Tuesday 28". The Captain of the MV Tampa advised that he was aware that  the Indonesian authorities were expecting him to arrive on Tuesday. 

  Minister Ruddock said that these events prove that Australia did not have  responsibility for co-ordinating the rescue of the survivors and hence could not have  responsibility for landing them on Australian soil. It further shows that the Indonesian  authorities were willing to accept the MV Tampa and its passengers as late as 28th  August.
