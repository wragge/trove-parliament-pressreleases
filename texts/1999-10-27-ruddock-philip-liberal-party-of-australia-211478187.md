  MEDIA RELEASE

  

  The Hon. Philip Ruddock MP

  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

  

 MPS 152/99

  

  

  MORE BOAT ARRIVALS ON AUSTRALIA’S 
NORTH WEST COAST

  

  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today confirmed that 16 8 boat people were located in just 3 days 
from 22-25 October.

  

 “I welcome the ‘in principle’ support offered 
by the Opposition for recent reforms, including the introduction of 
temporary protection visas for unlawful arrivals” Mr Ruddock said. 
“Any suggestion that these measures are excessive and unnecessary, 
or that the Opposition is wavering on its support, is of great concern, 
in light of further unprecedented arrivals.”

  

 The Minister was speaking on the transfer to mainland 
Australia today of 143 unauthorised boat people who landed at Ashmore 
Reef on Friday 22 October.

  

 “On Friday 22 October two boats arrived at Ashmore 
Reef - one vessel had 140 unauthorised arrivals on board and the other 
had 3 unauthorised arrivals on board. In addition, on Sunday 24 October, 
25 unauthorised arrivals were located on the north-west Kimberley Coast.

  

 “In the first four months of the current financial 
year - that is, from July to October this year, a total of 926 people 
arrived in Australia illegally on 28 boats.

  

 “In the same period last year, 20 people arrived 
in Australia illegally on five boats.

  

 “If this current rate of arrivals continues, it 
is estimated some 2800 illegal boat people could arrive in Australia 
this year.

  

 “This estimate is more than the total number of 
Vietnamese boat arrivals in the period from 1976 to 1981, when 2,200 
people arrived on 55 boats.”

  

 Mr Ruddock said that while the recent influx of illegal 
boat arrivals were from a number of countries, all of the boats originated 
in Indonesia.

  

 “The 28 boats that have arrived illegally in Australia 
since July this year have all come from Indonesia,” Mr Ruddock said.

  

 “Twenty of the 28 arrived at Ashmore Reef, a small 
uninhabited island, which is part of Australia about 400 kilometres 
off the north west coast of Australia. The reef is only about two days 
boat travel from Indonesia and is a prime target for people smugglers.”

  

 “These people smugglers are actively targeting Australia, 
and it is imperative that we attempt to remove incentives for unauthorised 
arrivals, so that Australia is not seen as a soft target.
