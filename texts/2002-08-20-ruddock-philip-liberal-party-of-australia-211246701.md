 Immigration Detention Housing Project a Success MPS 075/2002

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, has asked the department to explore the viability of extending the alternative detention arrangements for women and children following a successful trial in the South Australian township of Woomera.

 The success of this project justifies extending the existing arrangements in Woomera and my department will consider expanding the number of residents able to be accommodated within the township under similar arrangements.

 Participants have clearly benefited from the living conditions provided and it has been possible to maintain security with residents living in the town environment.

 While there will be community consultation on an expansion, one Woomera resident said, the presence of the detainees in town has been noteworthy for its 'unremarkableness'.

 Staff, and regular visitors to the project commented on how quickly women's self esteem grew as their role as mothers in the family was reinforced and they took control of managing their homes, their time and the priorities and activities of their children in a more normal domestic environment than was possible in the IRPC.

 I have agreed to expand the criteria for eligibility for women and children who participate in the alternative detention arrangements. This means that women and children may be eligible for participation in the project while their cases are being considered by the Refugee Review Tribunal or the Courts.

 I have also given approval for assessment on a case by case basis, which would include special needs cases and those who are vulnerable or at risk and who could otherwise not be accommodated appropriately in an immigration detention facility.

 Only those volunteers who have undergone health assessments are eligible to participate in the project.

 Participants in the project were under 24-hour supervision by officers from Australasian Correctional Management and any movements outside the perimeter of the house and yard are accompanied by an officer.

 These arrangements mean that project participants still remain in immigration detention.
