 Greens’ motion to grant visas to grieving family passes Senate 

 17 June 2014  

  A Greens’ motion calling on the Minister for Immigration to grant visas to the family of deceased  asylum seeker Leo Seemanpillai so that they can attend his funeral, has passed the Senate.  

 “Today the Senate has called on the Minister to urgently intervene in the case to ensure that Mr  Seemanpillai’s family are able to pay their last respects to their son, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young  said.   

 “It’s time for the Minister to have a heart and show some compassion towards a grieving family.  

 "This young man took his own life after living in limbo and with the constant fear of being deported  back to Sri Lanka, the least the Minister can do now is allow his family the opportunity to pay their  respects.  

 “The Minister has the power to grant visas to the family for the purpose of attending the funeral, but  has so far refused to do so.  

 “This family deserves better and the passing of this motion today shows that now is the time for the  Minister to change his mind, and to do the right thing so that they can say goodbye one last time.”
