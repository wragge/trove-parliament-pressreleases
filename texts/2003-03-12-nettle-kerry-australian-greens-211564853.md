 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 

 MEDIA RELEASE  12.03.03   

 From razor wire to electric fences   

 Senator Kerry Nettle has cautioned against celebration at the closure of the infamous  Woomera detention centre noting “There is little to celebrate from the transfer of  asylum seekers from razor wire to electric fences,” Senator Nettle said.   

 “In fact this move represents a step backwards in conditions for these detainees.”    

 The Baxter detention centre is;    Ã  surrounded by a 9000volt electric fence,   Ã  divides and isolates detainees roughly by ethnic group,   Ã  does not allow for appropriate schooling   Ã  has no residential housing programme for women and their children. 

  

  “This ‘Out of the frying pan into the fire’ situation serves to highlight the fundamental  moral bankruptcy of the mandatory detention system.   

  “This is a particularly bad outcome for those families in the Residential Housing  Programme. Mothers and their children will now be put back into a detention centre  or their partners will have to travel 6 hours (through the desert handcuffed in the back 

  of a police van?) to visit.   

  “The Greens have been calling for the closure (not mothballing) of Woomera IDC for  years, but as part of an improvement in conditions for detainees not a step backwards.   

  “Nothing in today’s announcement indicates any change in the Minister’s  commitment to the coercive and punitive asylum seeker policy.   

  The Greens Refugee and Asylum Seeker Policy calls for an end to mandatory  detention in favour of a community based model that respects the human rights of  asylum seekers and refugees.
