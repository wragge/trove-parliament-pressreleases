 Australian aid to assist homeless in Sri Lanka

 Australia is to provide funds totalling $250,000 to assist hundreds of thousands of people  made homeless by the conflict in Sri Lanka, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and  Trade, Neal Blewett, announced today.

 The funds are to be donated to Australian and international organisations working in Sri  Lanka to purchase shelter materials, clothing and medical supplies for an estimated  900,000 people.

 "Many families have been forced to flee their homes with virtually no possessions. Most  are now dependent on the Sri Lankan Government for food, and on international aid  donors for their other basic needs," Dr Blewett said.

 After the breakdown of the truce between the Sri Lankan Government and the Tamil  Tigers in June last year, Australia provided $200,000 in emergency assistance to purchase  and distribute food and medicines for families most in need.

 Dr Blewett said that, because of the continuing conflict, it was appropriate that the  Australian Government should now make another contribution. The funds would  significantly support NGO relief efforts to assist both Moslem and Tamil families.

 $82,000 of the Australian Government's contribution will go to Australian Catholic  Relief, to provide temporary and permanent housing to refugees in Mannar, Kurunegala  and Chilaw districts.

 $68,000 will be donated to Community Aid Abroad to support its relief program in  eastern Sri Lanka, which focuses on the provision of milk, protein supplements, basic  shelter, cooking utensils, agricultural implements, seed and fertiliser.

 Save the Children Fund will receive approximately $50,000 of Australia's contribution to  purchase solar powered fridges to store vaccines. The fridges, which are manufactured by  BP Solar (Australia), meet standards laid down by the World Health Organisation.

 A further $50,000 will be provided to UNICEF to support its major program of assistance  throughout Sri Lanka, and to provide essential medical supplies, basic needs and  sanitation. ·'-â 

 Australia's emergency assistance to refugees in Sri Lanka forms part of the Australian  Government's program of development co-operation administered by the Australian  International Development Assistance Bureau.
