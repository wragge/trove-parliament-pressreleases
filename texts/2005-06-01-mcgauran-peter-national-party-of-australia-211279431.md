 Media Release 

 Record Funding for Settlement Services

 1 June 2005

 A record $3.5 million has been allocated to help people from Arabic backgrounds to settle in their new Victorian  communities, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Peter McGauran, said today.

 ‘In contrast to claims made by the Victorian Arabic Social Services, nine Victorian organisations have been granted  funding for 20 projects to provide settlement services to Arabic communities,’ Minister McGauran said.

 ‘It is a nonsense to suggest that Arabic ethno-specific organisations should receive preferential treatment when allocating  grants. The funding must be directed to the organisations which have the skills and expertise to provide the best service to  migrants with an Arabic background.

 ‘To claim that a quota of Arabic ethno-specific organisations should receive funding is an insult to Arabic communities,’  Minister McGauran said.

 Approximately 7000 Arabic speaking settlers have arrived in Victoria over the last 5 years with a further 2000 expected in  2005-06. 

 The additional $3.5 million will assist new arrivals to access the full range of services available to all Australians. The  successful grants include programs to: 

 â     assist newly-arrived families from Iraq, Kuwait, Sudan, Albania, Somalia and Afghanistan to increase engagement 

 in their new communities â     work with mainstream service providers to break down the barriers for Arabic-speaking refugees and family 

 migrants â     encourage organisations to deliver culturally and linguistically appropriate services for humanitarian entrants from 

 Afghanistan.

 ‘Like all new arrivals, Arabic speaking migrants will receive world leading settlement services so that they can realise  their hopes and ambitions for themselves and their family.

 ‘This support will assist them to develop a sense of belonging and to contribute to their new community socially and  economically as soon as possible,’ Minister McGauran said.
