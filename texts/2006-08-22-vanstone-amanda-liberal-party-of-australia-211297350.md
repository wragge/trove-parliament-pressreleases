 Planning Tools for Migrant and Refugee Settlement  Organisations 

 22 August 2006 

 A range of new publications that paint a picture of refugee and humanitarian settlement  throughout Australia and separate publications to assist those providing services to such  entrants were released today by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs,  Amanda Vanstone.  

 “The publications were developed as part of a new settlement planning framework  introduced by the Government to help improve settlement services for newly-arrived  refugees and humanitarian entrants,” Senator Vanstone said.  

 “The publications show who has arrived in the past and who is expected to arrive over the  course of the next year, where they are settling , the make up of their families, level of  English abilities and details particular needs they may have to help them settle into life in  Australia.  

 “The publication also contains information on the cultural background of the countries from  where most of Australia 's humanitarian and refugee entrants are drawn.  

 “This information is important to a range of organizations, governments and service  providers.  

 “Not only does it paint a detailed picture of those arriving under our generous refugee and  humanitarian programme, which currently provides 13,000 places a year, it will help service  providers ensure their services are meeting the need.  

 “In the past five years, Australia has settled 176,472 permanent arrivals under the  Humanitarian, Family and Regional Skilled Stream who do need, or may need, some  settlement assistance.”

  “There are a number of challenges affecting the successful settlement of these groups,  including housing, community development, education/training, employment, English  language skills, provision of medical care and education, and these publications will help  those providers ensure their services are geared towards the people arriving in Australia  wherever they may settle,” Senator Vanstone said.  

  “Australia has a strong track record in helping new entrants to become self-sufficient as  soon as possible so they can participate fully in Australian society.”
