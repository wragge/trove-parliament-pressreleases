  Palestinian Elections 

  I have today, on behalf of the Australian Government, sent a message to Yasser Arafat  congratulating him and other members of the new Palestinian Council on their victories in the  historic elections held last Saturday. 

  The Palestinian people have for the first time a Government in which they have a direct stake,  and a leader whose position has been overwhelmingly endorsed. The voter turnout of around  75 percent was also a resounding endorsement of the peace process by the Palestinian people  and a demonstration of their determined commitment to the vision of peace being pursued by  Mr Arafat. 

  Despite some reports of irregularities in the conduct of the poll, Australian observers led by  the Hon. Mr Justice Dowd of the New South Wales Supreme Court, and other members of the  international observer team, are satisfied that the electoral process has overall resulted in a  valid democratic outcome. 

  The election itself represents a major achievement for the IsraellPalestinian peace process and  underlines its growing strength as it approaches the critical stage of permanent status  negotiations on Jerusalem, refugees and security . Both sides may now proceed to this next  and final stage of the peace process, confident that they have the support of their respective  peoples. 

  The successful conduct of the Palestinian elections is also a tribute to both sides who have  worked so hard to bring about concrete results from the peace negotiations.
