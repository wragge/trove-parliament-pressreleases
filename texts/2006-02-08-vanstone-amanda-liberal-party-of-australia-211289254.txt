 Australia to Welcome 680 Refugees in February

 Australia will welcome 680 refugees this month - the most for any month this year, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda  Vanstone, said today.

 ‘These people have fled persecution and have lived through events and circumstances most Australians could scarcely imagine,’ the Minister said.

 ‘Many have fled persecution and violence and the group includes children who have known no other life than in a refugee camp. Australians  should be proud that they are giving these people a new life and a future.

 ‘The 680 refugees arriving this month are among the 13 000 refugee and humanitarian entrants who will be resettled in Australia this financial  year.

 ‘The refugees have been referred to Australia for resettlement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

 ‘They come from a number of countries including Burma, Burundi, Liberia, Iraq, Rwanda and Sudan.

 ‘They are being resettled in Canberra, Launceston, Hobart, Darwin, Perth, Adelaide, Townsville, Cairns, Brisbane, Wagga Wagga, Coffs Harbour,  Sydney and Melbourne.’

 Australia is one of the top three countries in the world with a dedicated refugee and humanitarian resettlement program.

 ‘We spend about $500 million a year on support and services for those in most desperate need of resettlement. That’s $2 billion over a four-year  budget cycle,’ the Minister said.

 ‘The Australian Government’s integrated humanitarian settlement strategy will help these refugees to become self-sufficient and participate in the  community as quickly as possible.

 ‘Assistance provided includes torture and trauma counselling, intensive reception and case management services, accommodation support, help in  establishing a household, health and psychological services, and links to essential services such as Centrelink, Medicare and banking.’
