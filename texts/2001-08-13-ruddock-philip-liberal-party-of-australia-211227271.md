 Legislative Provisions Restore Integrity to Refugees Convention MPS 117/2001

 "Proposed legislative changes to the Migration Act will restore the application of the Refugees Convention in Australia to its generally accepted interpretation, promote integrity in protection visa applications and strengthen the international protection system," Philip Ruddock, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, announced today.

 "The Government has been concerned for some time that the 1951 Refugee's Convention has become so widely interpreted that it is in danger of failing the very people that it was designed to protect," Mr Ruddock said.

 "We are in a situation today where grossly differential outcomes on refugee determination occur depending upon the country in which protection is being sought. For example, the UNHCR assessing the protection claims of asylum seekers intercepted in Indonesia en route to Australia, is achieving a acceptance rate of 14.6% for Afghanis and 59.6% for Iraqis. In Australia, the same caseload achieves acceptance rates 84% for Afghanis and 94% for Iraqis.

 "It is unacceptable that people who are able to pay a people smuggler and make their way through several countries where they may avail themselves of protection, are getting a more favourable outcome than people languishing in the most appalling circumstances in refugees camps around the world," Mr Ruddock said.

 "The Australian government has re-iterated its commitment to support the Refugees Convention, however we cannot support the continued expansive interpretation of the application of the Convention which is contributing to the abuse of the asylum system to achieve migration outcomes," Mr Ruddock said.

 Mr Ruddock said that the legislation will also include measures to discourage fraudulent claims by asylum seekers, including in relation to identity and nationality, and will discourage asylum seekers from committing offences in Australia or deliberately taking action in Australia that would generate refugee claims.

 "In introducing these measures the Government will ensure that they do not put us in breach of our international obligations, and we have already been in discussions with the UNHCR over these proposals," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Australia has a strong commitment to its international obligations under the Refugees Convention framework," the Minister said, "but it is critical that we continue to support this important work on all levels - by targeting fraud and misuse of Australia's domestic refugee protection arrangements as well as making vigorous efforts to help address refugee problems at their source, and I will be making further announcements in relation to these matters in due course."

 The legislative amendments will include the following:

 Provide a test for persecution as "serious harm", which is expected to include the elements of threat to life or liberty, or significant physical harassment or ill-treatment, or significant economic hardship that threatens a person's capacity to subsist, where the persecution feared is part of a systematic or discriminatory conduct directed against the person.

 1.  

 Provide that "persecution" must have occurred "by reason of" a Refugees Convention ground for protection obligations to be owed to a person, by requiring that the predominant motivation for the persecution must be for a Refugees Convention reason;

 2.  

 Define "a particularly serious crime", for the purpose of excluding people who are convicted of such crimes and who constitute a danger to the community from the benefit of Australia's protection under the Refugees Convention, as identified types of offences carrying the penalty of death, life imprisonment or a maximum sentence of at least three years imprisonment;

 3.  

 Provide for a Ministerial public interest intervention power following Administrative Appeals Tribunal decisions in relation to Refugees Convention exclusion issues under Articles 1F, 32 and 33(2) of the Refugees Convention and protection visa decisions under character grounds under the Migration Act 1958;

 4.  

 Provide that any action by a person in Australia shall not be used or taken into account in determining whether Australia owes them protection obligations unless they satisfy the Minister that any such actions were done in good faith and not to strengthen the protection claims;

 5.  

 Ensure that a person is not granted a permanent protection visa for four years after the date of any conviction in Australia, whether during detention or while in the community, for a criminal offence carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment of twelve months or more;

 6.  

 Provide that unauthorised arrivals and protection visa applicants may be required to provide information on which they rely on oath or affirmation, and that the Minister 7.  

 may draw adverse inferences as to the veracity of such evidence or claims should an applicant, when required, fail to provide evidence on oath or affirmation or in a form appropriate for any religious persuasion; Provide that in a claim for a protection visa, the Minister may, in the absence without reasonable explanation of acceptable identifying documentation, draw adverse inferences as to the veracity of claimed identity and/or nationality;

 8.  

 Provide that a person may be granted a protection visa on the basis of being a member of the family unit of a person who is owed protection obligations, that the bar on repeat protection visa applications would bar such people from making a repeat application for a protection visa, and that the repeat application bar would also cover people whose protection visas have been cancelled;

 9.  

 Provide that a temporary protection visa holder is to notify the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs of any change of address within 14 days; and 10.   Provide that a former TPV holder who has had their visa cancelled for any reason

 will, if they apply again for protection, be eligible for grant only of a TPV in the first instance.
