  Release 

  The Hon Philip Ruddock MP Parliament House, Canberra ACT 2600 Minister for immigration and Multicultural Affairs Telephone: (02) 6277 7860 Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation Facsimile: (02) 6273 4144 MPS 042100 STATES ARE WRONG, IMMIGRATION MINISTER SAYS Contrary to comments by SA and Queensland State Premiers Olsen and Beattie, temporary protection visa holders moving from detention centres into the community should not incur a cost to States and Territories, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today. “I am very surprised that Mr Olsen is raising this issue now, shortly before our Ministerial Council meeting on immigration matters in New Zealand later this week, as earlier this year I sent a letter to all Premiers and Chief Ministers explaining the temporary protection visa arrangements. “This stated quite clearly that temporary protection visas holders (TPVs) were entitled only to a limited range of benefits entirely funded by the Federal Government. * A copy of the letter is attached. “These meet our international obligations to these people who have been found to be in genuine need of protection, “ he said. . “They are able to work, and are eligible for special benefit (which is stringently means tested), rent assistance, maternity and family allowances and family tax payment and Medicare. “There has been a great deal of confusion surrounding the release of people from detention centres into the community. These people arrived undocumented and illegally on Australia’s shores, largely by boat, in the last six months of 1999. “In the normal course of events, people who arrive in Australia illegally and make a claim to remain as a refugee are detained until their claims are processed. If they cannot mount a successful claim to remain in Australia they are returned to their country of origin as quickly as possible. “Australia’s border control arrangements are very strict and are applied rigorously and consistently, regardless of country of origin.” Mr Ruddock said. “The people who are currently being released into the community with temporary protection visas, have been able to establish successful claims to refugee status under the Refugee Convention. However, because they arrived illegally and undocumented, they are not entitled to permanent residence status - this will only be granted if, after three years, they are able to demonstrate that they are still refugees.” Australia has a proud record of resettling refugees, through a structured and appropriate Humanitarian Program which has resettled over five million people since 1945. “Temporary protections visas, giving three-years temporary residence and limited benefits, rather than permanent residence, were introduced to make Australia a less attractive destination for people smugglers and their victims, while meeting our international obligations, “ he said. “They are deliberately less attractive than the services we provide for those people in need who settle here lawfully through our Humanitarian Program. Immigration information is also available on the Internet: www.immi.gov.au

  “While we must look after the health and welfare of TPV holders, we have built in a   number of disincentives to discourage their unauthorised arrival. For example, they   are unable to sponsor their families to join them; they are not eligible for on-arrival   accommodation, English language tuition or material assistance under the   Community Refugee Settlement Scheme.” 

  “If the States then decide to pick up the tag for some of these services, Australia will   once again appear an attractive destination.” 

  Mr Ruddock also said that it presumptuous to assume that hundreds of TPV holders   would “descend” on Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane. 

  “Processing of the some 1300 detainees at Woomera is still proceeding and it is   premature to guess how many people will be released into the community. 

  “It is also our experience that after a short while in the first place of destination, they   often to move inter-state to join their ethnic communities.” 

  “Let us also not forget that the presence of the detention centre at Woomera has   resulted in the establishment of a major industry for the town, with a number of local   job opportunities,” he said.

  The Hon John Olsen 

  Premier of South Australia   gKh Floor   Terrace Towers   178 North Terrace   Adelaide SA 5000 

  Dear Premier 

  The Commonwealth Government has taken a number of measures to stem the   flow of unauthorised boat arrivals to Australia following significantly increased   numbers of arrivals during 1999. My purpose in writing is to inform you of the 

  measures taken and to enlist the co-operation of your State in adopting a 

  common approach to this matter. 

  The new measures taken to reduce Australia’s attractiveness as a destination   for unauthorised arrivals do not conflict with our obligations towards refugees   under the International Convention. The measures extend to refugees temporary   (rather than permanent) protection for a 3 year period but deny them access to 

  family reunion over that period, to any automatic right of return if they leave 

  Australia, to any consideration of claims for permanent residence for at least 30   months and to the specialised suite of humanitarian settlement services. 

  The Government is requiring refugees with a temporary protection visa to accept   primary responsibility for meeting their own living requirements during the visa   term or until permanent residence is granted. 

  In line with our International Convention obligations, however, the refugees have   been accorded the right to work. They will be able to access Medicare, Special   Benefit including exemption from the newly arrived resident’s waiting period,   Rent Assistance, Family Allowance, IVlaternity Allowance, Family Tax Payment 

  and will be eligible for referral to the Early Health Assessment and Intervention   Program. 

  While it would not be appropriate for these refugees to be denied any basic   rights, it would be consistent with the Commonwealth’s intentions if State   assistance to these refugees were restricted to essential or basic services. 

  I understand that a number of State service access issues have been raised in 

  discussions at officer level and there are no doubt more. My officers will be 

  pursuing these issues through the dppropriate channels with the relevant State   officers. 

  Yours sincerely 

  Signed by

  63. TEMPORARY PROTECTION VISAS 

  This fact sheet gives information about   Australia’s Temporary Protection Visa (TPV)   which came into force on 20 October 1999 with   changes to the Migration Regulations. 

  The reason for the TPV 

  From 1994 until the regulation change in   October 1999 all refugees in Australia, including   unauthorised arrivals found to be refugees, had   immediate access to a permanent protection   visa. 

  This visa provided permanent residence and   immediate access to the comprehensive   settlement support arrangements provided to   refugees resettled from overseas. 

  These arrangements are far more generous than   required by Australia’s international obligations. 

  As 1999 progressed, it became clear that they   were attracting increasing misuse of Australia’s   onshore protection arrangements by organised   people smuggling rackets. 

  Large numbers of people, many of whom were   abandoning or ignoring existing protection   arrangements were travelling to Australia   unlawfully to try to gain residence in Australia. 

  The regulation changes on 20 October 1999   keep in place the fundamental protection   arrangements needed to meet our international   obligations for unauthorised arrivals found to be   refugees. 

  The regulations remove the additional benefits   which had been encouraging misuse of the   protection process by unauthorised arrivals. 

  Under the new regulations unauthorised arrivals   found to be refugees have access only to a three   year temporary visa, in the first instance. 

  What the TPV confers 

  Compared with the permanent protection visa,   the TPV provides no rights for unauthorised   arrivals to: 

  l bring their families into Australia; 

  l return if they leave Australia; 

  l access the generous settlement services   provided to refugees who enter Australia   lawfully; or 

  0 access the mainstream social welfare   system to obtain pensions and newstart   allowance. 

  To meet Australia’s international obligations   towards refugees, temporary protection visa   holders are: 

  able to work; 

  eligible for Special Benefit, Rent Assistance,   Maternity and Family Allowances and Family   Tax Payment. (Any Special Benefit   entitlement is stringently means-tested and 

  is reviewed every 13 weeks); 

  able to gain access to Medicare benefits; 

  eligible for referral to the early health   assessment and intervention program; 

  eligible for torture and trauma counselling; 

  able to apply for a permanent protection visa   which may be granted after 30 months if   they still need protection. 

  Temporary protection is granted only to those   unauthorised arrivals who are found to be   refugees. All other unauthorised arrivals are   removed from Australia as soon as reasonably 

  practicable. 

  People who arrive legally in Australia and   successfully seek asylum continue to be able to   access permanent residence (See Fact Sheet   41, Seeking asyhm in Australia and Fact Sheet   46 Australia’s international protection 

  obligations) . 

  Recent boat arrivals 

  In 1999, 86 boats brought 3728 passengers   without authority to Australia (plus 101 crew).   Only 200 people arrived by boat in 1998. To date   in 2000, three boats have arrived with 187 

  passengers (plus 14 crew).   Unauthorised arrivals are detained, as required   by law, at Immigration Reception and Detention   Centres (IRPCs) at Port Hedland, Curtin and   Woomera. The detainees mainly claim to be   from Iraq or Afghanistan. 

  Assistance with protection claims 

  All unauthorised arrivals are interviewed in   detention to establish identity, reasons for 

  coming to Australia and if they have claims 

  which, prima facie, may engage our protection   obligations. 

  Where Australia’s protection obligations may be   engaged, these people are offered publicly   funded assistance from registered Migration   Agents under the Immigration Advice and   Assistance Scheme (IAAAS). 

  This service covers assistance with preparation,   lodgement and presentation of claims for   protection to the departmental decision maker   and the preparation and lodgement of any   application for review by the Refugee Review   Tribunal (RRT). See Fact Sheet 70, immigration 

  advice and application assistance scheme. 

  Health issues 

  DIMA has a comprehensive process for   checking the health of unauthorised arrivals in   detention. All medical, dental and specialist   treatment is routinely made available as 

  medically required. 

  All unauthorised boat arrivals undergo health   screening within 24 hours of their arrival at   IRPCs. 

  The medical officer assesses any health   problems identified from this screening process   as soon as practicable, depending on the   urgency of the problem. 

  Where any serious communicable diseases are   suspected or confirmed, formal notification   procedures are followed with Commonwealth   and State/Territory health authorities. 

  Those whd are found to be refugees are   required to undergo further health and character   checks before the grant of the visa. This   includes a health examination and chest x-ray. 

  Once a person has met all the criteria for grant   of a TPV, including having undergone health   checks, he or she is entitled to be granted a   TPV, and by law, must be released from   detention. 

  Follow up and monitoring of persons with a   health condition is undertaken by state health   authorities in accordance with routine practices.   DIMA assists by passing contact details of the 

  person to health authorities. 

  All released TPV holders are given a post-   release information sheet in their own language.   This includes information on how to obtain a   Medicare card and how to find help and   treatment for medical problems. 

  For example, the sheet tells them that they are   eligible for the early health intervention-and   assessment service which provides a full health   assessment, as well as referral for any medical   treatment needed. 

  The service also provides advice for TPV   holders on the need for referral, the referral   process, and gives assistance with making initial   appointments with appropriate service providers. 

  Why not return the unauthorised arrivals? 

  Australia has international obligations not to   return a refugee to face persecution or death in   their homeland. This obligation applies   irrespective of whether Australia’s Migration laws 

  have been broken by the individual. See Fact   Sheet 46, Australia’s international protection   obligations. 

  Where unauthorised arrivals are found not to be   refugees, the Migration Act requires that they be   detained and removed as soon as reasonably   practicable. However there is no guarantee that   the country from which they left or those through   which they travelled will take them back. 

  Developing return and readmission agreements   with other countries is a complicated issue and   will require considerable international effort to   resolve. 

  People smugglers are preying on these people   with false promises of a warm welcome in   Australia for unauthorised arrivals. 

  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural   Affairs, Philip Ruddock, travelled to China in   October 1999 and to Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Iran   and Pakistan in January 2000 to meet officials in 

  those countries and seek co-operation in   addressing people smuggling issues. 

  Information on Australian Immigration matters is   available through the Internet on   http://www.immi.qov.au and through the Department’s   fax on demand facility by telephoning 1902 242 5088. 

  The Department also operates a national telephone   inquiry line on 131 881 for the cost of a local call 

  anywhere in Australia.
