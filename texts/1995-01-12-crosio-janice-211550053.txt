 CROSIO TAKES TOUGH STAND ON BOAT ARRIVALS.

 Federal Member for Prospect, Janice Crosio, has welcomed the tough stand taken by  Immigration Minister, Nick Bolkus, in clamping down on illegal entries into Australia.

 “I am a strong supporter o f giving assistance to refugees. But in recent weeks we have  seen the system abused by arrivals undermining the integrity o f our humanitarian  programs." Mrs Crosio said.

 After a spate o f illegal arrivals, the Federal Government recently announced that it  would tighten the law to ensure there can be no confusion as to who is to be classified aa 6 refugee.

 Legislation will be introduced in the Federal Parliament to make it clear that claims for  refugee status can not be made under China’s one child policy. The legislation will  also deal with repeat applications, persons subject to prior protection and other  unfounded claims for refugee status.

 "These changes actually strengthen our commitment to offer protection to genuine  refugees.

 “Over the past year 13,000 genuine refugees have been accepted in Australia. The  measures we are taking are aimed at doing away with costly abuse o f our system.

 "These new measures are aimed at stopping illegal arrivals imposing themselves on  Australia’s open society and undermining the integrity o f both our migration and  humanitarian programs.

 "It is necessary to send a strong message to people in China who may be considering  departing: People abusing the system will be sent back, genuine cases will be  welcomed.

 “In this way we will be able to stem the tide o f arrivals we have recently experienced."  Mrs Crosio said.
