 ADDRESS BY THE HON JOHN KERIN MINISTER FOR TRADE & OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT TO AUSTRALIAN OVERSEAS DISASTER RESPONSE ORGANISATION

 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

 SYDNEY, 16 NOVEMBER 1992

 GENERAL SHARP, MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

 I NOTE THAT AODRO HAS JUST CELEBRATED THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS FOUNDATION.  CONGRATULATIONS, AND THANK-YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY.

 SINCE BECOMING MINISTER FOR OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT AND TRADE, I HAVE BEEN KEEN TO RAISE THE PROFILE OF THE DEBATE ON AUSTRALIA'S OVERSEAS AID AND TO SEE THAT THE ISSUES ARE EXPLORED IN GREATER DEPTH. I BELIEVE THERE IS NO GAIN TO AUSTRALIA OR TO THE PARTNERS IN THE DEBATE IF AID ISSUES ARE ONLY EXAMINED AS A KNEE-JERK REACTION TO MEDIA STORIES.

 THE IMMEDIATE EMOTIONAL DEBATE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES PRODUCES A LOT OF SMOKE WHICH CAN OBSCURE AND DISTORT THE REAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES AND THE REAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS.  THE CHALLENGE IS TO BUILD ON THIS INITIAL INTEREST BY PROVIDING

 INFORMATION IN A DIGESTIBLE FORM TO ENRICH THE DEBATE AND FEED INTO THE POLICY PROCESS.

 WITH THIS IN MIND, LAST WEEK I PRESENTED IN PARLIAMENT CHANGING AID FOR A CHANGING WORLD, WHICH EXPLAINS THE ISSUES THE GOVERNMENT IS ADDRESSING IN AID PROGRAMS IN THE 19905.

 SOME ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE HAS INDICATED THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED BY THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE PAPER. I WELCOME SUCH DISCOVERY.  THE DEVELOPMENT/AID DEBATE HAS FREQUENTLY BEEN OVERSIMPLIFIED.

 THE FUNDAMENTAL GOAL OF THE AID PROGRAM REMAINS THE SAME: THE PROMOTION OF SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ADVANCEMENT OF PEOPLE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE APPROACH THIS IN MANY WAYS: FROM DISASTER RELIEF AND EMERGENCY FOOD AID, TO LONG TERM EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT.

 TO ENSURE WE ARE MOST EFFECTIVE IN OUR WORK, WE MUST REASSESS THE METHODS OF ACHIEVING OUR GOAL AS THE WORLD AROUND US CHANGES ECONOMICALLY AND POLITICALLY.

 AT THE UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT IN RIO DE JANEIRO IN JUNE THIS YEAR, THE NATIONS PRESENT AGREED THAT FOR DEVELOPMENT TO BE SUSTAINABLE IT MUST INTEGRATE ECONOMIC, ECOLOGICAL, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ASPECTS OF DAILY LIFE. THERE ARE CLEAR, TWO-WAY LINKS BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND POVERTY, BETWEEN SUSTAINABLE ECOSYSTEMS AND

 SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH. IN THE AREA OF DISASTER RELIEF THE ENVIRONMENT PROVIDES AN ADDED DIMENSION IN THAT SO MUCH OF THE WORE IS CONCERNED WITH NATURAL DISASTERS.

 THIS IS AS TRUE FOR THE DRAMATIC CYCLONES AND THE VOLCANOS AS IT IS FOR THE IMPACT OF MORE REGULAR EVENTS WHEN CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED IN THE DAILY LIVES OF THE PEOPLE AFFECTED.

 AFRICA PROVIDES MANY EXAMPLES. WE SAW IN THE SAHEL SOME YEARS AGO THAT AS RAINS FAIL THERE IS INCREASING PRESSURE ON THE ENVIRONMENT. AS TREES ARE FELLED FOR FUEL AND EVERY AVAILABLE PLANT IS HARVESTED FOR HUMAN OR ANIMAL CONSUMPTION, THE DISASTER GETS WORSE. VICTIMS ARE TEMPTED TO MOVE OFF THEIR LAND TO FEEDING CENTRES WITH THE RESULT THAT THE NEXT

 CROP CANNOT BE PLANTED. THE DESERT SPREADS AND THE DAMAGE BECOMES PERMANENT.

 IN SOUTHERN AFRICA AND THE HORN OF AFRICA TODAY, THE SAME PROBLEMS CAN BE SEEN. FOOD RELIEF IS NEEDED BUT THIS IS ONLY A SHORT TERM SOLUTION. WHAT IS REALLY NEEDED IS A MULTIFACETED APPROACH WHICH ADDRESSES NOT ONLY THE IMMEDIATE

 SURVIVAL PROBLEM BUT ALSO THE LONGER TERM RECOVERY NEEDS.

 I AM PLEASED THAT THE AGENCIES WORKING IN SOMALIA AND SOUTHERN AFRICA ARE MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO HELP PEOPLE TO REMAIN ON THEIR LAND. THE NGO PROGRAMS PROVIDING RECOVERY ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN AFRICA ARE PARTICULARLY USEFUL AND I COMMEND THIS APPROACH.

 THIS MULTIFACETED APPROACH IS VITAL.  TIME AND AGAIN WE SEE EVIDENCE THAT DEVELOPMENT IN ONE FIELD, AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS, LEADS TO PROBLEMS - POSSIBLY EVEN TO A DETERIORATION OF CAPABILITY WHICH CAN BE DESCRIBED AS ANTI-DEVELOPMENT.

 SUCCESS REQUIRES CAREFUL COORDINATION AND A COMMITMENT TO COOPERATION BETWEEN ALL THE AGENCIES INVOLVED. NO SINGLE AGENCY CAN EXPECT TO HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS.  EACH MUST EXAMINE THE FIELD WITHIN WHICH IT IS WORKING AND HOW THIS

 FITS INTO THE TOTAL DEVELOPMENT PICTURE, THEN COOPERATE WITH OTHER AGENCIES TO SEEK COMPATIBILITY OF AIM AND ACTIVITY.

 I STRESS THIS BECAUSE OF MY CONCERN ABOUT THE POOR INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION OF DEVELOPMENT AID AND EMERGENCY RELIEF. IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA, COORDINATION SOMETIMES SEEMS TO BE THE EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE RULE.

 THE APPOINTMENT OF A UNITED NATIONS UNDER SECRETARY GENERAL FOR HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS WITH A MANDATE TO COORDINATE EMERGENCY RELIEF ACTIVITIES INDICATES THAT MY CONCERN IS SHARED IN THE WIDER INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  UNFORTUNATELY THE FULL BENEFITS OF THIS APPOINTMENT HAVE STILL TO BE REALISED AND WE CONTINUE TO SEE, AS IN SOMALIA, FRAGMENTATION AND CONFUSION.

 EVEN SUCH AN AUGUST FIGURE AS MR MOHAMED SAHNOUN, WHO WAS THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL'S SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR SOMALIA, STATED PUBLICLY THAT A WHOLE YEAR SLIPPED BY WHILE THE UN AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, SAVE FOR ICRC AND A FEW NGOS, WATCHED SOMALIA "DESCEND INTO ... HELL".

 THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO THE SOMALI CRISIS RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS, EQUITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE - AND

 ABOUT ITS ABILITY TO RESPOND PROMPTLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO A FOOD EMERGENCY IN A LAND OF NEGLIGIBLE STRATEGIC VALUE OR INFLUENCE.

 IN THEIR FULL CONTEXT, THE DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN COORDINATING AND DELIVERING AID IN SOMALIA ALSO RAISE THE ISSUES OF GOVERNANCE, SOVEREIGNTY AND THE LIMITATIONS ON THE

 INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, NO MATTER HOW WELL-INTENTIONED IT MAY BE.

 IN THE PACIFIC, IN MUCH LESS COMPLEX SITUATIONS, WE CAN SEE THE PROBLEMS OF UN COORDINATION.  AS CYCLONE VAL STRUCK WESTERN SAMOA LAST DECEMBER, THE LAST SHIPMENT OF UN CO-ORDINATED FOOD AID IN RESPONSE TO CYCLONE OFA HAD JUST ARRIVED IN THE COUNTRY. IT CAME IN USEFUL, BUT CYCLONE OFA HAD PASSED BY 22 MONTHS BEFORE!

 TOO OFTEN THE UN HAS FAILED TO MEET ITS RESPONSIBILITIES AS A RESULT OF INTERNAL RIVALRIES, INEFFICIENCY OR LACK OF PRACTICALITY. TO IMPROVE THIS PERFORMANCE IT NEEDS THE FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL SUPPORT OF ITS MEMBERS - BUT IT MUST EARN THIS SUPPORT. AS THE WORLD'S PEAK CO-ORDINATION BODY

 IT SHOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF EXCELLENCE.

 WE ARE WORKING ON THIS AND, AS YOU KNOW, AUSTRALIA IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO UN ACTIVITIES AROUND THE WORLD.  DONORS WILL BE RELUCTANT TO CHANNEL FUNDS THROUGH ANY ORGANISATION WHICH THEY PERCEIVE TO BE USING MORE MONEY TO DO LESS THAN THEY CAN DO THEMSELVES. ONLY BY STRIVING TO EXCEL AND DEMONSTRATING THAT IT CAN DO BETTER WILL THE UN GAIN THE SUPPORT IT NEEDS.

 WITH THIS IN MIND, I WELCOME THE UNDERTAKING MADE DURING THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN BY INCOMING PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON THAT THE UNITED STATES WILL BE MOVING TO PAY THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UN WHICH HAVE BEEN HELD BACK OVER RECENT YEARS.  SUCH A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE BY THE NEWLY-ELECTED LEADER OF THE WORLD'S MOST

 POWERFUL COUNTRY IS A VERY POSITIVE ENDORSEMENT OF THE UN'S ROLE IN THE WORLD.

 I AM GLAD TO SAY THAT IN THE EMERGENCY RELIEF FIELD IN OUR OWN REGION WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO BETTER COORDINATION IN THE FUTURE. OFFICIALS FROM AIDAB MET RECENTLY WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS FROM NEW ZEALAND AND FRANCE TO DEVELOP ARRANGEMENTS FOR BETTER COOPERATION AND COORDINATION IN

 DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC.

 EARLY THIS YEAR IN VANUATU WE SAW AUSTRALIAN AND FRENCH ARMY HELICOPTERS MAKING COMPLEMENTARY RELIEF DELIVERIES SUPPORTED BY A ROYAL NEW ZEALAND AIR FORCE AIRCRAFT.  IN THE FUTURE, I HOPE TO SEE SUCH ARRANGEMENTS MORE FREQUENTLY.

 WITHIN AUSTRALIA,  OUR CO-ORDINATION ARRANGEMENTS ARE EFFECTIVE. THE LINKS BETWEEN AIDAB, THE NATURAL DISASTERS ORGANISATION (ACTING AS AIDAB'S AGENT), THE DEFENCE FORCE, AND NGOS ARE GOOD AND AUSTRALIAN RESPONSE TO REGIONAL DISASTERS IS FAST AND WELL TARGETED.

 WE MUST ALSO RECOGNISE THAT AID NEEDS ARE CHANGING RAPIDLY AND OUR APPROACH TO THE PROVISION OF AID MUST CHANGE WITH THEM. FLEXIBILITY DOES NOT COME EASILY.  IT IS NECESSARY FOR THOSE INVOLVED TO PARTICIPATE IN DETAILED NEGOTIATIONS TO

 ENSURE THAT CHANGES ARE MADE SMOOTHLY AND WITH MINIMUM DISRUPTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.

 THIS IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE. AS CHANGING AID FOR A CHANGING WORLD POINTS OUT, AUSTRALIA IS MAKING CHANGES TO ITS AID PROGRAM. IN THIS DECADE WE LOOK FORWARD TO A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT CHANGES:

 IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA, THE LARGEST RECIPIENT OF AUSTRALIAN AID, TRANSFERRING OUR AID PROGRAM FROM BUDGET SUPPORT TO PROGRAM AID;

 CONCENTRATING OUR AID TO AFRICA IN SECTORS WHERE AUSTRALIA HAS SPECIAL EXPERTISE;

 FOCUSSING OUR AID TO SOUTH EAST ASIA AND CHINA MORE CAREFULLY SO AS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE DIFFERING GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS AND LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT.

 INCREASING THE EMPHASIS OF OUR AID TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES TO IMPROVE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE RURAL SECTOR .

 IN ALL PARTS OF ITS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, AUSTRALIA WILL BE PLACING INCREASING EMPHASIS ON INITIATIVES THAT WILL INVOLVE WOMEN IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND ON PROGRAMS THAT HELP TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT.

 IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC, AUSTRALIA HAS A SPECIAL POSITION AS THE LARGEST DEVELOPED COUNTRY IN A RAPIDLY DEVELOPING REGION. SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES ARE SMALL BY WORLD STANDARDS AND AID FUNDS PROPORTIONATELY LARGE. AS A MAJOR REGIONAL DONOR, AUSTRALIAN ACTIVITIES COME UNDER SPECIAL SCRUTINY.

 OUR AID FORMS THE BACKBONE OF DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE TO THIS REGION. WE MUST ENDEAVOUR TO GET IT RIGHT SO AS TO MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF BOTH THE REGIONAL COUNTRIES WE ARE HELPING AND OF OTHER DONORS WHO WILL LOOK TO US FOR COOPERATION AND EXPERTISE WHEN THEY WORK HERE.

 THE GOVERNMENT'S COMMITMENT IS CLEAR: AFTER YEARS IN WHICH THE RATIO BETWEEN OUR AID FUNDING AND GNP HAS BEEN REDUCED, WE HAVE TURNED THE CORNER. WITH THE INCREASE IN THE AID BUDGET FOR 1992/93 TO $1.38 BILLION, WE HAVE RAISED THE RATIO

 TO 0.36% OF GNP, SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE OECD AVERAGE.

 WE ARE NOT COMPLACENT AND THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS ITS COMMITMENT TO REACHING THE UN'S TARGET RATIO OF 0.7% WHEN BUDGET CIRCUMSTANCES PERMIT.

 $1.38 BILLION IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT, BUT IN THE WORLD AID PICTURE, IT IS SMALL. AUSTRALIA CONTRIBUTES ROUGHLY 2% OF THE TOTAL WORLD AID FROM INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES.

 NEVERTHELESS OUR CONTRIBUTION IS AMPLIFIED BY OUR COMMITMENT TO A QUALITY AID PROGRAM WHICH TARGETS OUR AID WHERE AUSTRALIA CAN APPLY ITS SPECIAL SKILLS AND RESOURCES TO BEST EFFECT. WE REJECT ANY SUGGESTION OF A ISCATTERGUNI APPROACH

 TO AID.

 WHILE THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED OVER $11 BILLION TO ASSIST THE DEVELOPING WORLD IN THE LAST DECADE, AUSTRALIANS HAVE PRIVATELY CONTRIBUTED ABOUT $1 BILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD THROUGH THE MANY NON-GOVERNMENT ORGANISATIONS INVOLVED IN OVERSEAS AID AND DEVELOPMENT.

 THE SUCCESS OF THE CONTINUING APPEALS FOR SOMALIA SHOW THAT, FAR FROM SUFFERING 'AID FATIGUE', THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC REMAINS A GENEROUS PUBLIC.  ISOLATED CALLS TO REDUCE AID AND LOOK AFTER OURSELVES FIRST MUST BE REJECTED IN THE FACE OF SUFFERING THAT HAS NOT BEEN EXPERIENCED IN OUR WESTERN SOCIETY FOR A LONG TIME - POSSIBLY FOR CENTURIES.

 BOTH GOVERNMENT AND NON-GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IN DEVELOPMENT AID HAVE THEIR STRENGTHS AND ABILITIES AND THESE MUST BE USED TO BEST ADVANTAGE. JUST AS AID SHOULD BE WELL COORDINATED

 INTERNATIONALLY, SO SHOULD IT BE WELL COORDINATED AMONG AUSTRALIAN AGENCIES.

 IN CHANGING AID FOR A CHANGING WORLD WE OUTLINE SEVERAL MEANS WHEREBY AIDAB AND NGOS CAN WORK IN A MORE INTEGRATED WAY. I ALSO HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT I WILL ESTABLISH AN ADVISORY COUNCIL ON AID POLICY WHICH I WILL CHAIR. THROUGH THESE INITIATIVES WE CAN IMPROVE COORDINATION AND CONSULTATION FROM THE POLICY

 LEVEL THROUGH TO OPERATIONS ON THE GROUND.

 IN THE FIELD OF DISASTER RESPONSE AND MITIGATION, THE CO-OPERATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND NON-GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IS NOW VERY GOOD. AS IN THE WIDER FIELD OF DEVELOPMENT, EACH HAS ITS STRENGTHS, WITH NGOS WORKING AT GRASS ROOTS LEVEL AND GOVERNMENT, WITH ITS GREATER RESOURCES, IN THE WIDER FIELD OF ASSISTANCE.

 THE GOVERNMENT FREQUENTLY FUNDS NGO DISASTER, REFUGEE AND EMERGENCY PROJECTS AND ALLOCATIONS FOR THESE PURPOSES HAVE FORMED THE LARGEST CATEGORY OF AID FUNDS PROVIDED TO NGOS IN

 RECENT YEARS.

 IN OUR OWN REGION OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC, DISASTERS ARE SMALL BY WORLD STANDARDS AND MAY EXCITE LITTLE INTEREST OUTSIDE THE REGION. WHAT IS RARELY APPRECIATED, EVEN HERE IN AUSTRALIA, IS THAT IN PROPORTION TO THE SIZE OF POPULATIONS AND THE

 ECONOMIES, THESE DISASTERS MAY BE CONSIDERED AMONG THE MOST DEVASTATING IN THE WORLD.

 A WORLD BANK TEAM VISITING WESTERN SAMOA EARLY THIS YEAR AFTER CYCLONE VAL STATED THAT THEY HAD NEVER SEEN A COUNTRY ON WHICH A SINGLE EVENT HAD HAD SUCH A DEVASTATING EFFECT. WHEN YOU REALISE THAT OVER 80% OF THE HOUSES IN THE COUNTRY SUFFERED MAJOR DAMAGE, THAT OVER 60% OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED REPAIR AND THAT EVERY FAMILY IN THE COUNTRY WAS AFFECTED, YOU CAN SEE THAT THE SCALE OF THE DISASTER WAS HORRIFIC. APPLY THOSE EFFECTS PROPORTIONALLY TO AUSTRALIA AND THINK HOW WE WOULD COPE IN THIS COUNTRY.

 IT WAS TO COORDINATE THE NGO RESPONSE TO DISASTERS OVERSEAS, SPECIFICALLY IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC, THAT AODRO WAS FORMED IN 1982. THROUGHOUT ITS EXISTENCE IT HAS RECEIVED THE GREATEST PART OF ITS CORE FUNDING FROM GOVERNMENT, A TOTAL OF OVER $3 MILLION HAVING BEEN COMMITTED FOR THIS PURPOSE.  IT IS ENCOURAGING TO HEAR THAT IN THE LAST YEAR, THE MEMBER NGOS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE THEIR PROPORTION OF CORE FUNDING TO 10%.

 FORTUNATELY, COORDINATION FREQUENT. CONTRIBUTED THE REGION.

 ALTHOUGH AODRO HAS BEEN CALLED ON TO PERFORM ITS FUNCTION REGULARLY, THE NEED HAS NOT BEEN IN PERFORMING THIS FUNCTION, AODRO STAFF HAVE TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE AUSTRALIAN RESPONSE IN

 I AM AWARE THAT AODRO'S FUNCTIONS, ITS EFFECTIVENESS, AND ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER ORGANISATIONS WERE REVIEWED THIS YEAR AND THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE REVIEW TEAM ARE THE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSIONS AND CONSULTATIONS WITH INTERESTED AGENCIES. I UNDERSTAND THAT AIDAB EXPECTS TO SUBMIT ITS

 FINDINGS TO ME FOR DECISION BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR.

 IN OUR CHANGING WORLD, INCREASING POPULATIONS EXACERBATE BOTH THE EFFECT AND THE FREQUENCY OF NATURAL DISASTERS. INCREASED USE OF MARGINAL AND UNUSED LAND, LARGER CONCENTRATIONS OF PEOPLE IN URBAN AREAS, AND DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT ALL CONTRIBUTE TO THE LIKELIHOOD THAT NATURAL HAZARDS WILL AFFECT COMMUNITIES MORE FREQUENTLY AND MORE SEVERELY THAN IN THE PAST.

 FOR THIS REASON, THE 1989 UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY DECLARED THE 1990S THE INTERNATIONAL DECADE FOR NATURAL DISASTER REDUCTION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE DECADE IS TO REDUCE, THROUGH CONCERTED INTERNATIONAL ACTION, THE LOSS OF LIFE, PROPERTY DAMAGE AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DISRUPTION CAUSED BY NATURAL DISASTERS, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

 WHILE TO SOME EXTENT THE DECADE HAS BEEN DEVELOPING INTO AN INTERNATIONAL "TALKFEST", AUSTRALIA HAS BEEN AT PAINS TO MAKE A PRACTICAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE DISASTER MITIGATION CAPABILITIES OF COUNTRIES IN ITS OWN REGION.

 SOME YEARS BEFORE THE DECADE WAS DECLARED, AND BEFORE AIDAB INITIATED ITS OWN PACIFIC DISASTER PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM, AODRO AND THE AUSTRALIAN RED CROSS SOCIETY IDENTIFIED A GAP IN THE READINESS OF NON-GOVERNMENT ORGANISATIONS IN SOUTH

 PACIFIC NATIONS TO WORK TOGETHER DURING AND AFTER DISASTERS. IN 1985, WITH AIDAB FUNDING AND SUPPORT, THE TWO ORGANISATIONS BEGAN A SERIES OF IN-COUNTRY NGO DISASTER PREPAREDNESS WORKSHOPS WHICH AODRO CONTINUES.

 THE WORKSHOPS HAVE PROVIDED REGIONAL NGOS WITH USEFUL TRAINING AND HELPED THEM TO DEVELOP ORGANISATIONS AND PLANS FOR CLOSER COOPERATION IN THE RELIEF OF DISASTER EFFECTS IN THEIR COUNTRIES.

 I COMMEND THOSE INVOLVED FOR THEIR INITIATIVE IN THIS FIELD AND FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO REGIONAL DISASTER MITIGATION CAPABILITIES.

 THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY, AND I WISH YOU ALL A USEFUL AND PRODUCTIVE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING.
