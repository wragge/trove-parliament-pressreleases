 Media  release       26  May  2005  

 GRANT FUNDING BOOST FOR GRIFFITH MULTICULTUAL COMMUNITY  COUNCIL INC.   

 

 The Nationals Member for Riverina, Kay Hull, today announced that Griffith Multicultural  Community Council has been granted $64,803 to help with an information, referral and advocacy  service to migrants and humanitarian entrants in the Griffith area.   

 Griffith Multicultural Community Council will assist migrants and refugees, from some of the  poorest and most war-ravaged countries in the world, settle in the local area.    

 “This year the majority of the 13,000 humanitarian entrants to arrive in Australia will have a limited  knowledge of western culture, and speak very little English,” said Kay Hull.    

 Griffith Multicultural Community Centre plays an essential role to help migrants and refugees  develop a sense of belonging in their new community while providing them with every opportunity  to realise their ambition for themselves and their families,” Kay Hull said.   

 “Organisations such as Griffith Multicultural Community Council assist migrants and refugees to  find accommodation, employment and provide English language training and health care.   

 In 2005/ 06 the Australian Government will spend a record $30 million on programs to help  migrants and refugees settle as quickly as possible in their new homes.   

 Australia is internationally recognised as a world leader in settlement services with dedicated  resettlement programs delivered by organisations such as Griffith Multicultural Community  Council to help our recent arrivals to settle into their new home.   

 A full list of grant recipients and general information about the new grants is available at  www.immi.gov.au/grants.
