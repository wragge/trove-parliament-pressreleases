 Boat Arrival Numbers Stabilise MPS 087/2001

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock said today that he was encouraged that the number of unauthorised arrivals reaching Australia by boat in the past year had stabilised.

 "In the past 12 months we have seen a slight drop in the number of people arriving by boat and also a drop in the number of boats arriving on our shore, suggesting the Government's policies are having an impact," Mr Ruddock said.

 "At a time when many countries are seeing a growth in the insidious trade of people smuggling, the number of people arriving in Australia by boat has dropped marginally from 4,175 in 1999-2000 to 4,141 last year.

 "In 1999-2000 we saw 74 boats arrive on Australia's shores, but in the year just ended, that number dropped to 54," Mr Ruddock said.

 The fall in both boats and people could be attributed to a range of measures from the Government both in Australia and overseas.

 "There is little doubt that the cooperation from countries in the Middle East and throughout Asia in disrupting the activities of people smugglers, is having an impact," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Indonesia has detained more than a thousand people attempting to unlawfully transit its borders, bound for Australia and countries in the Middle East have also worked closely with us to identify people travelling on false documents.

 "The drop in the number of boats arriving follows the introduction of higher penalties imposed on people smugglers and powers to seize vessels involved in bringing people to

 Australia.

 "Because of the penalties, it is likely the organisers are finding it more difficult to attract crew and to arrange boats.

 "The Government will continue to focus on cooperation with source and transit countries and will be stepping up its efforts to return people when they have no lawful right to remain.

 "Australia has been working closely with international agencies and other countries to arrange for returns, because this sends a strong signal to those considering engaging people smugglers," Mr Ruddock said.
