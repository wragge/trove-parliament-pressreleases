  EXTENTION OF COMMUNITY SETTLEMENT SERVICES SCHEME FUNDING ANNOUNCED

  

  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, 
Philip Ruddock announced at the FECCA Conference on Saturday that current   Community Settlement Scheme (CSS)  
worker-based awards will be extended for another twelve months until 
30 September 1999.

  

  “I have responded to advice from the Refugee Resettlement 
Advisory Council and a range of community views regarding the duration 
of funding by extending the current worker-based awards for another 
year,” Mr Ruddock said.

  

  “New applications for worker-based awards will 
therefore be considered in the 1999-2000 funding round.

  

  “From next year CSS Scheme grants will be awarded 
for 12, 24 or 36 months, providing funded organisations with more scope 
for longer term planning and service provision”.

  

  Mr Ruddock also announced that community organisations 
can now apply for funding for project-based awards to assist migrants, 
refugees and humanitarian entrants effectively settle in Australia under 
the   Community Settlement Services 
(CSS) Scheme.

  

  Administered by the Department of Immigration and 
Multicultural Affairs, the new project-based awards will make funding 
available from 1 October 1998 for one year.

  

  “The Government is committed to providing services 
which help migrants, refugee and humanitarian entrants to settle in 
their new country and quickly become contributing members of our community,” 
Mr Ruddock said.

  

  The Minister said priority would be given to applications 
which focus on projects or services aimed at addressing the settlement 
needs of recently arrived migrants, in particular:

  

  *   isolated individuals such as the aged and women in 
difficult situations; and

  

  *   new arrivals belonging to emerging communities who 
have a demonstrated settlement need arising from their pre-arrival experiences, 
and/or the cultural and language difficulties they face on arrival in 
Australia.

  

  “I also encourage joint 
submissions from community-based agencies and organisations which address 
priority settlement needs and foster broader communi  ty interaction.

  

  “Consideration will also be given to applications 
for continued development of existing projects as well as innovative 
new proposals.”

  

  Total funding provided in 1998-99 for the CSS Scheme 
project-based and worker-based awards is $14.74 million.

  

  Funding under the CSS Scheme 
project-based grants was advertised in Saturday's press (28/3/98). Application 
forms are available from DIMA offices in each State and Territory and 
will close on Wednesday 29 April 1998. Final decisions will be m  ade by July 1998.
