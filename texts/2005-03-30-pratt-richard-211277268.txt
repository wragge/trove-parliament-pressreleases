  RICHARD PRATT, WATER SUMMIT SYDNEY, MARCH 30 2005 

  GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY 

  WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I’M GLAD TO SEE THAT SO 

  MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ATTRACTED TO THIS SUMMIT TO 

  DISCUSS A SUBJECT WHICH IS OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO 

  THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY - WATER. 

  HOPEFULLY I CAN SHED SOME LIGHT ON JUST HOW AND  WHY I’VE BECOME SO PASSIONATE ABOUT WATER. AND 

  THEN I’LL TRY TO OUTLINE SOME OF THE THINGS I’D LIKE 

  TO SEE HAPPENING IN WATER BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE. 

  THE FIRST THING TO SAY IS THAT I CAME TO THE WATER  ISSUE IN A ROUNDABOUT WAY. 

  IT WAS ACTUALLY AS A RESULT OF MY EFFORTS TO HELP 

  PROMOTE A MUCH HIGHER POPULATION FOR AUSTRALIA. 

  AS A PERSON WHO CAME TO THIS COUNTY AT FOUR 

  YEARS OF AGE WITH HIS REFUGEE PARENTS, I’VE ALWAYS  BEEN GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES IT HAS GIVEN 

  ME. 

  EN THROUGH TH EYES OF AN IMMIGRANT WHO  DOESN’T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED, AUSTRALIA IS A LAND OF 

  U N L I M ITE D 0 P PO RTU N IT1 ES . 

  1 

  EXPLOITING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH HARD 

  WORK AND PERSISTANCE PAYS OFF HANDSOMELY. 

  THE VlSY BUSINESS FOUNDED BY MY PARENTS AND TWO 

  OTHERS IN 1948 NOW EMPLOYS ABOUT 6000 AUSTRALIAN§. 

  AND WE CAN STILL SEE MANY MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR 

  GROWTH THAN WE’LL EVER BE ABLE TO TAKE UP. 

  AS MY OWN BUSINESS HAS GROWN OVER THE DECADE§, 

  I’VE DEVELOPED A PASSIONATE BELIEF IN THE POTENTIAL  FOR AUSTRALIA. 

  WE HAVE ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITIES TO ADD MORE 

  VALUE TO OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AND BECOME ONE 

  OF THE WORLD’S LEADING COUNTRIES OF THE 2IST 

  CENTURY. 

  IT’S TRUE THAT  IN MANY WAYS - LIKE QUALITY OF LIFE - 

  WE’RE ALREADY THE ENVY OF THE WORLD. 

  BUT IT’S ALSO TRUE THAT OUR COMPARATIVELY SMALL 

  ECONOMIC SIZE AND POPULATION BASE MAKE US 

  LARGELY IRRELVANT ON THE GLOBAL SCENE. 

  FOR ALMOST AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER I’VE HELD THE  VIEW THAT FOR AUSTRALIA PO ACHIEV 

  POTENTIAL WE NEED TO DOUBLE OUR POPULATION 

  GROWTH RATES TO 2 PER CENT A YEAR. 

  2 

  THIS WOULD NEED TO COME THROUGH NATURAL GROWTH 

  AND IMMIGRATION. AND IT WOULD GIVE US A POPULATION 

  OF ABOUT 50 MILLION BY 2050. 

  I’VE BEEN ACTIVELY PROMOTING THESE VIEWS FOR MANY 

  YEARS. A FEW YEARS AGO I HELPED FOUND THE  AUSTRALIAN POPULATION INSTITUTE TO FURTHER 

  DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE POPULATION 

  LEVEL FOR THIS COUNTRY. 

  POPULATION IS AN EMOTIVE ISSUE AND THERE ARE MANY 

  DIFFERENT VIEWS. FOR EXAMPLE MANY IN THE 

  ENVIRONMENT MOVEMENT ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO A 

  DRAMATIC POPULATION INCREASE. 

  MY COMPANY HAS LONG ENJOYED A GOOD WORKING 

  RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ENVIRONMENT MOVEMENT. 

  WE’VE ALWAYS WORKED TO EXPLORE AREAS OF COMMON 

  INTEREST RATHER THAN POINTS OF DIFFERENCE. 

  REDUCING WASTE, DOING MORE WITH LESS, AND 

  OPERATING AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE ARE BUSINESS 

  GOALS WHICH ARE TOTALLY CONSISTENT WITH GOOD 

  ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICE. 

  ALWAYS HAD THESE GOALS. TH 

  DOWN TO M 

  DEPRESS ION. 

  R WHO LIVED THROUGH THE 

  3 

  ANYWAY, AS THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT POPULATION 

  BEGAN TO FIND TRACTION, I GOT THE CLEAR MESSAGE 

  FROM THE ENVIRONMENT MOVEMENT THAT IT WOULD 

  NEVER SUPPORT HIGHER POPULATION RATES FOR 

  AUSTRALIA UNLESS WE FIX OUR WATER SITUATION FIRST. 

  SO I BEGAN TO EXPLORE WATER AS AN ISSUE. AND THE 

  MORE I LEARNED THE MORE FASCINATED I BECAME. 

  I QUICKLY CAME TO THE VIEW THAT AUSTRALIA’S WATER 

  CHALLENGES HAVE MUCH MORE TO DO WITH 

  MANAGEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION THAN WITH ACTUAL 

  WATER SHORTAGES. 

  WE MAY BE THE DRIEST CONTINENT, BUT GIVEN OUR 

  SMALL POPULATION WE ACTUALLY HAVE QUITE A LOT OF  WATER PER HEAD. 

  OUR WATER CRISIS ARISES FROM OUR FAILURE TO MAKE 

  BETTER USE OF THE WATER RESOURCES WE HAVE. 

  HISTORICALLY WE’VE TREATED WATER LIKE A FREE GOOD 

  WITH UNLIMITED SUPPLIES. ONLY RECENTLY HAVE WE 

  COME TO REALISE HOW DAMAGING THIS HAS BEEN. 

  COMPARED TO SOM 

  S WHO REGARD 

  WATER AS A PRECIOUS RESOURCE TO BE CONSERVED, 

  REUSED AND RECYCLED AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY, WE’VE 

  SQUANDERED IT. 

  4 

  EARLIER THIS YEAR I ATTENDED THE WORLD ECONOMIC 

  FORUM IN SWITZERLAND WHERE I WAS INVITED TO SPEAK 

  ABOUT AUSTRALIA’S WATER CHALLENGES. 

  DURING THAT SESSION I LEARNED THAT IN SINGAPORE,  LOSSES FROM THEIR URBAN WATER SYSTEM ARE JUST 

  2%. IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, 

  LOSSES ARE RUNNING AT MANY TIMES THIS LEVEL AND IN 

  SOME CASES CAN EXCEED 50%. 

  FOR A DRY CONTINENT, AUSTRALIA HAS BEEN QUITE 

  PROFLIGATE WITH WATER. WE’VE OVER ALLOCATED IT, 

  OVER USED IT, OVER TREATED IT AND UNDER 

  APPRECIATED IT. 

  IN THE PROCESS WE’VE STRESSED OUR RIVERS. SOME 

  PEOPLE THINK THAT IF WE DON’T TAKE DRASTIC ACTION 

  SOON WE’LL DO OUR ENVIRONMENT IRREPARABLE 

  DAMAGE. 

  I’M NOT SO PESSIMISTIC. BUT I DO KNOW THAT IF W E  

  WANT TO SUSTAIN AND GROW OUR POPULATION, OUR 

  AGRICULTURAL BASE, OUR QUALITY OF LIFE AND PROTECT 

  OUR ENVIRONMENT, WE HAVE TO DO A LOT MORE THAN 

  WE’RE DOING AT THE MOMENT. 

  HAVING TAK ASSIONATE INTEREST IN WATER FOR 

  ABOUT FIVE YEARS NOW, I’M DELIGHTED TO SEE THAT 

  WATER HAS BEEN ELEVATED INTO THE NATIONAL DEBATE. 

  5 

  BUT I STILL CAN'T HELP WORRYING THAT OUR APPROACH 

  TO WATER IS LIKE MARK TWAIN'S QUOTE ABOUT THE 

  WEATHER: "EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT IT, BUT 

  NOBODY'S DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT." 

  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE URGENTLY NEED TO STOP 

  TALKING AND START DOING. YES, I KNOW THAT THINGS  HAVE STARTED TO HAPPEN. BUT THERE IS JUST SO MUCH 

  THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. 

  AS YOU ALL KNOW, THE VAST MAJORITY OF AUSTRALIA'S 

  28,000 KILOMETRES OF IRRIGATION AND STOCK SUPPLY 

  CHANNELS ARE OPEN. THEY LOSE VAST QUANTITIES OF 

  WATER TO EVAPORATION AND SEEPAGE. 

  SOME OPEN STOCK AND DOMESTIC SUPPLY SYSTEMS 

  LOSE UP TO 80% OR MORE THROUGH EVAPORATION AND  SEEPAGE. 

  LOSSES IN IRRIGATION SYSTEMS ARE SOMEWHAT LESS. 

  BUT THEY CAN STILL BE UP TO 40% - A MASSIVE AMOUNT  IN VOLUME TERMS. 

  ON OUR IRRIGATION FARMS MORE THAN 70 PER CENT OF  THE 2.5 MILLION HECTARES UNDER IRRIGATION STILL USE 

  FLOOD OR FURROW M 

  IF THEY SWITCHED TO THE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT DRIP, 

  SPRAY OR OTHER METHODS THEY COULD CUT WATER USE 

  BY BETWEEN 20 AND 90 PER CENT IN SOME CASES.  6 

  WHEN PEOPLE FROM COUNTRIES LIKE ISRAEL COME TO 

  AUSTRALIA AND SEE HOW MUCH WATER WE WASTE 

  THROUGH FLOOD AND FURROW IRIGATION THEY ARE 

  HORRl FED. 

  BUT IT’S NOT JUST AGRICULTURE - ALTHOUGH THAT IS  WHERE THE BULK OF OUR WATER IS USED. 

  IN OUR CITIES THERE’S VIRTUALLY NO WATER RECYCLING. 

  WHAT’S MORE WE’RE SPENDING A FORTUNE TO TREAT 

  OUR URBAN WATER TO POTABLE - OR DRINKING -  STANDARDS. 

  THEN WE’RE USING MOST OF THAT HIGH GRADE WATER TO  FLUSH OUR TOILETS, WATER OUR GARDENS AND WASH 

  OUR CARS. 

  LESS THAN 5 PER CENT OF THE WATER WHICH COMES  INTO OUR HOMES NEEDS TO BE OF POTABLE QUALITY. SO 

  THAT EXTRA TREATMENT IS A MASSIVE WASTE OF 

  RESOURCES. 

  BUT YOU DON’T NEED ME TO TELL YOU FACTS LIKES THESE 

  TODAY. YOU ALREADY KNOW THEM. 

  YOU ALL KNOW THERE ARE HUGE GAINS TO BE MADE 

  FROM BETTER MANAGEMENT AND A “FOCUS AND FIX” 

  APPROACH TO OUR WATER SYSTEMS. 

  THESE GAINS COULD PRODUCE ENOUGH WATER SAVINGS 

  TO MEET OUR RIVERS’ ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS AS WELL 

  AS ENSURING SUSTAINABLE GROWTH OF OUR 

  POPULATION AND OUR AGRICULTURE INDUSTRIES. 

  AT THE SAME TIME TH RE ARE MUCH NEEDED 

  REGULATORY REFORMS WHICH ARE BEING MADE. THESE 

  REFORMS WILL HELP REMOVE WATER SQUABBLING 

  BETWEEN STATES AND ENSURE THAT WATER FLOWS TO 

  THOSE AGRICULTURAL USES WHICH MADE THE MOST 

  ECONOMIC SENSE. 

  FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU CAN GET  $50,000 A HECTARE OR 

  MORE FOR HIGH VALUE CROPS LIKE CHERRIES, YOU 

  AREN’T GOING TO WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT PAYING THE 

  RIGHT ECONOMIC PRICE FOR WATER. 

  I’M PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERMENT, AND 

  ESPECIALLY JOHN ANDERSON HAS RECONFIRMED IT’S 

  COMMITMENT TO WATER POLICY AND REFORM OVER THE 

  NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. 

  THE NATIONAL WATER INITIATIVE, ABOUT WHICH JOHN 

  ANDERSON AND KEN MATTHEWS HAVE JUST SPOKEN,  IS A 

  BUT I REMAIN SCEPTICAL THAT POLICY ALONE WILL FIX  THE PROBLEM QUICKLY ENOUGH. 

  8 

  IN SHORT WE NEED A MAJOR NATIONAL WATER 

  INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING PROGRAM. THE $2 BILLION 

  FLOWING UNDER THE WATER INITIATIVE IS A START, BUT 

  NOT NEARLY ENOUGH. 

  IN TRUTH WE NEED A NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE 

  SPENDING PROGRAM IN A LOT MORE AREAS THAN WATER. 

  AND I'VE BEEN LOBBYING FOR THAT TOO. AND NOW THE 

  BUSINESS COUNCIL HAS TAKEN UP INFRASTRUCTURE AS A 

  MAJOR ISSUE FOR THE NATION. HOPEFULLY THE MESSAGE 

  IS STARTING TO GET THROUGH TO OUR POLITICIANS. 

  BUT BACK TO WATER WHICH IS THE TOPIC FOR THIS 

  MORNING. 

  TO HELP FOCUS ATTENTION ON THE WATER ISSUE I'VE 

  BEEN CALLING FOR A NATIONAL PROGRAM TO PIPE  - OR 

  LINE AND COVER - THE MOST INEFFICIENT OPEN 

  IRRIGATION CHANNELS, AND SAVE THE WATER LOST TO 

  EVAPORATION AND SEEPAGE. 

  I'VE SUGGESTED THAT THIS PROJECT MIGHT BE FUNDED 

  BY THE GOVERNMENT ISSUING SPECIAL WATER BONDS 

  THAT OUR SUPERANNUATION FUNDS COULD INVEST IN. 

  THAT WOULD RAlS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHICH TH  GOVERNMENT WOULD MAKE AVAILABLE TO THE VARIOUS 

  WATER AUTHORITIES TO CARRY OUT THE WORK. 

  9 

  I’VE TRIED TO CONVINCE THE GOVERNMENT THAT GETTING 

  WATER RIGHT WILL NOT ONLY BE THE BEST THING WE CAN 

  DO FOR THE LONG TERM FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY, IT 

  WILL BE A SHORT TERM VOTE WINNER WITH THE 

  ELECTORATE. 

  OF COURSE IT WON’T BE WITHOUT PAIN. DESPITE THE 

  NATIONAL WATER INITIATIVE, THE WATER POLICY REFORM 

  PROCESS STILL HAS A VERY LONG WAY TO GO. 

  FOR EXAMPLE  I THINK WE STILL HAVE WAY TOO MANY 

  WATER AUTHORITIES TRYING TO SERVE COMPETING 

  INTERESTS. 

  BUT WE DO APPEAR TO BE WELL ON THE WAY T O  

  ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR INALIENABLE 

  WATER RIGHTS AND AN OPEN WATER TRADING SYSTEM T O  

  ENSURE THAT WATER GOES TO THE MOST APPROPRIATE 

  ECONOMIC USE. 

  THAT’S REALLY THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN 

  PUT A PRICE ON OUR RIVERS’ ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS 

  AND BUY WATER BACK FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IN CASES 

  WHERE THAT’S DEEMED NECESSARY. 

  NOW OF COURSE YOU ALL KNOW THAT I’M NOT TH 

  PERSON WHO’S TAK N A PASSIONAT ST IN WATER 

  AND THE FUTURE OF AUSTRALIA. 

  10 

  EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DISCOVERED IN MY STUDY OF THE 

  TOPIC HAS BEEN KNOWN PREVIOUSLY. 

  WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DO IS TO BRING FOCUS TO THE ISSUE 

  AND HELP RAISE ITS PROFILE ON THE NATIONAL AGENDA. 

  IT'S FINALLY STARTING TO GET THROUGH. 

  TO ASSIST THIS PROCESS MY COMPANY JOINED THE 

  FEDERAL AND NSW GOVERNMENTS IN A FEASIBILITY 

  STUDY OF POTENTIAL WATER SAVINGS IN THE 

  MURRUMBIDGEE VALLEY. 

  THE STUDY  IS NOW COMPLETE AND IS WITH THE FEDERAL 

  AND NSW GOVERNMENT'S FOR REVIEW - AND HOPEFULLY, 

  FOR ACTION. 

  THE REPORT AND IT'S ASSOCIATED RESEARCH RUNS INTO  MANY THOUSANDS OF PAGES. I'LL TRY TO GIVE A BRIEF 

  OVERVIEW THIS MORNING. 

  THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE SHOULD 

  GO TO THE WEB SITE WHICH YOU WILL FIND AT "WWW, DOT 

  PRATT WATER, DOT COM" 

  ESSENTIALLY THE PROJECT EXAMINES THE BUSINESS 

  CASE FOR SAVING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS  OF WATER IN 

  MURRUMBIDG 

  11 

  AT THE SAME TIME IT ALSO IDENTIFIES WAYS OF 

  BOOSTING REGIONAL PROD U CTlVl TY AND 

  ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY WITH THE WATER SAVINGS. 

  FIRSTLY SOME BACKGROUND: 

  THE MURRUMBIDGEE RIVER RISES SOUTH OF CANBERRA 

  AND RUNS WEST FOR SOME 1,700 KM BEFORE ENTERING  THE MURRAY RIVER NEAR BALRANALD. 

  THE VALLEY REGION COVERS SOME 84,000 SQUARE  KILOMETRES AND THE RIVER CONVEYS SOME 4,300 

  GIGALITRES OF WATER ANNUALLY. 

  OF THIS, 

  IRRIGATION AND OTHER HUMAN USES. 

  ABOUT 65% IS LICENCED FOR DIVERSION FOR 

  THE VALLEY’S WATER USERS FACE MANY CHALLENGES. 

  THESE INCLUDE: 

  PROBLEMS WITH AGING WATER SUPPLY AND 

  DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE; LIMITS ON CURRENT 

  WATER ALLOCATIONS; FUTURE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING 

  CLIMATE; TH NSURE SUSTAINABILITY; 

  AND, GROWING COMPETITIVENESS FROM GLOBALISED 

  MARKETS FOR THE REGION’S PRODUCTS. 

  12 

  TO UNDERTAKE THE STUDY WE SOUGHT A VERY WIDE 

  RANGE OF EXPERTISE WITH THE AIM OF ARRIVING AT A 

  "WHOLE-OF-VALLEY'' SOLUTION TO THE WATER 

  SUSTAI NAB I LlTY CHALLENGE. 

  SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WE POSED AND ANSWERED 

  INCLUDED: 

  e WHAT IS THE SCALE OF THE VALLEY'S WATER 

  LOSSES AND WATER SAVING OPPORTUNITIES? 

  0 HOW CAN WE CAPTURE OR MlNlMlSE THOSE 

  LOSSES? 

  e WHAT INVESTMENTS CAN WE MAKE TO 

  TACKLE WATE R-SAVI N G S? 

  e HOW CAN WE HARNESS SAVED WATER TO 

  PROVIDE SUSTAINABLE REGIONAL BENEFITS - 

  BOTH HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL? 

  e HOW CAN WE REDUCE THE COST OF WATER- 

  SAVING INFRASTRUCTURE.? 

  e HOW CAN WE FINANCE WATER-SAVING 

  INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS? AND, 

  e WHAT REFORMS CAN GOVERNMENTS ADOPT 

  TO BOOST INVESTMENT IN WATER-EFFICIENCY 

  AND MAKE IT A PRIORITY ON THE NATION'S 

  ACTION AGENDA. 

  SOME HIGHLIGHTS OF THE REPORT ARE: 

  13 

  e WE FOUND SOME 1,300 GIGALITRES PER YEAR 

  OF LOST OR UNACCOUNTED FOR WATER IN 

  THE SYSTEM - THAT'S MORE THAN 30% THAT'S  NOT ON THE BALANCE SHEET 

  e THERE ARE SOME $824M WORTH OF POSSIBLE 

  NEW INVESTMENTS TO HELP SAVE MUCH OF 

  THAT WATER; 

  0 THOSE WATER SAVING INVESTMENTS AND 

  NEW WATER-EFFICIENT PRODUCTION IN THE 

  VALLEY CAN PROVIDE SOME 4,500 NEW JOBS 

  AND BOOST VALLEY-WIDE GDP BY UP TO $245 

  MILLION.. 

  AS AN EXAMPLE, ONE OF THE PROPOSED INVESTMENTS IS  TO INSTALL AND PROPERLY MANAGE, NEW WATER 

  MEASURING AND MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY. 

  ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN MANAGEMENT CLICHES GOES 

  THAT "IF YOU CAN'T MEASURE IT, YOU CAN'T MANAGE IT" 

  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HOW CAN WE MANAGE WATER IN 

  NSW WHEN  QF THE 80,000 OR SO WATER EXTRACTION 

  OINTS ACROSS TH STATE, ONLY 20% HAV 

  OF MEASURING DEVICE FITTED? 

  14 

  AND OF THESE 20%, ONLY ABOUT A QUARTER ARE 

  ACTUALLY MONITORED ON A REGULAR BASIS? 

  THE REPORT ALSO RECOMMENDS SEVENTEEN SPECIFIC 

  “ACTION STEPS”. 

  15 

  ONE OF THE MAJOR STEPS IS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO 

  ISSUE WATER CONCESSION DEEDS IN ORDER TO FINANCE 

  AND OPERATE NEW REGIONAL WATER INFRASTRUCTURE 

  T H RO U G H PRIVATE- P U B L I C B U S I N E S S ALL I AN C E S . 

  RIGHT NOW, ATTRACTING INVESTMENT FOR REGIONAL 

  WATER-SAVING INFRASTRUCTURE IS DIFFICULT. THIS IS 

  BECAUSE MOST WATER SYSTEMS INVOLVE A 

  COMPLICATED MIX OF LAND HOLDINGS, WATER USER 

  TITLES, AND LAND MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES. 

  WE NEED A MORE BUSINESSLIKE APPROACH TO  ATTRACTING PRIVATE INVESTMENT TO WATER SAVING 

  PROJECTS. 

  ONE WAY OF DOING THIS WOULD BE FOR GOVERNMENTS 

  TO ISSUE CONCESSION DEEDS, TO PACKAGE REGIONAL 

  WATER-SAVI NG OPPORTUN ITlES INTO INVESTMENT 

  PROJECTS. 

  THIS  IS NOT UNLIKE THE TOLL ROAD CONCEPT WHERE A 

  PRIVATE INVESTOR FUNDS THE PROJECT AND HAS THE 

  RIGHT TO COLL CT TOLLS FOR A C 

  THE ASSET RETURNS TO PUBLIC OWNERSHIP. 

  16 

  NOW NOBODY PARTICULARLY LIKES TOLL ROADS. BUT 

  THERE IS A GENERAL ACCEPTANCE THAT THEY ARE AN 

  ESSENTIAL PART OF FUNDING MAJOR ROAD 

  INFRASTRUCTURE. 

  GOVERNMENTS JUST DON'T SEEM TO HAVE THE MONEY. -  ALTHOUGH, I AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN ARGUING THAT 

  FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS' OBSESSION WITH 

  DEBT REDUCTION HAS GONE TOO FAR AND IT'S TIME TO 

  START SPENDING. 

  BUT, ASSUMING THE GOVERNMENT WILL STILL LOOK FOR 

  PRIVATE MONEY TO FUND WATER INFRASTRUCTURE WE 

  CAN SEE WATER FUNDING NOW IS NOT UNLIKE ROAD  FUNDING WAS 20 OR MORE YEARS AGO. 

  JUST AS A TOLL ROAD OPERATOR GETS TO KEEP THE TOLL 

  COLLECTIONS FOR A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD, A WATER 

  CONCESSION DEED WOULD GIVE A PRIVATE INVESTOR THE 

  RIGHT TO KEEP OR TRADE, WATER SAVED FROM A WATER 

  SAVING PROJECT WHICH THE PRIVATE INVESTOR 

  FINANCED. 

  RNMENT WOULD BE RESPONSI 

  IT COULD BUY 

  OR TAKE AN OPTION ON, SOME OF THE SAVED WATER FOR 

  ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS WHEN THEY ARE NEEDED. 

  17 

  AFTER A DEFINED PERIOD OF TIME, WHCH IS ENOUGH TO 

  GIVE THE INVESTOR AN ADEQUATE RETURN, THE PROJECT 

  WOULD REVERT TO PUBLIC HANDS. 

  TO HELP MAKE THIS VIABLE, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD 

  NEED TO CREATE A NEW TITLE TO SAVED WATER TO  REWARD WATER EFFICIENCY INVESTORS WITH FUTURE 

  WATER SECURITY. 

  SAVED WATER SHOULD BE RECOGNISED AS A NEW 

  CATEGORY OF WATER. IT SHOULD HAVE ITS OWN SECURE 

  WATER TITLE AS REWARD FOR THE INVESTMENT EFFORT 

  TAKEN TO PRODUCE THE SAVED WATER. 

  THIS  IS BECAUSE PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT IN WATER 

  EFFICIENCY WILL NOT OCCUR UNLESS IT'S ACCOMPANIED 

  BY A CLEAR AND UNEQUIVOCAL PROPERTY RIGHT TO THE 

  WATER SAVED. 

  THIS RIGHT MUST TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER EXISTING 

  WATER SECURITY LEVELS TO PROVIDE MORE 

  GUARANTEED ACCESS TO THE SAVED WATER DURING 

  CARCITY. OTH 

  TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT. 

  18 

  THE REPORT ALSO RECOMMENDS THE INTRODUCTION OF 

  A WATER EFFICIENCY CERTl F I CATE PROGRAM. 

  THIS IS A SPEClFC MARKET-BASED INCENTIVE FOR  DRIVING WATER EFFICIENCY INVESTMENT. IT WOULD 

  WORK IN A SIMILAR WAY TO THE WAY RENEWABLE 

  ENERGY CERTIFICATES CURRENTLY WORK IN THE ENERGY 

  SECTOR. 

  WATER EFFICIENCY CERTIFlCATES WOULD BE TRADABLE 

  INSTRUMENTS BASED ON APPROVED AND VERIFIABLE 

  WATER EFFICIENCY ACTIONS AND TARGETS. 

  FOR EXAMPLE, JUST AS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR, 

  GOVERNMENTS COULD SET WATER AUTHORITIES SPEClFC 

  WATER USE REDUCTION TARGETS. 

  A REGULATOR COULD THEN ISSUE A TRADABLE 

  CERTIFICATES FOR EVERY MEGALITRE  OF WATER SAVED 

  WATER USERS UNDER THE SCHEME. 

  IN ORDER TO MEET THEIR GOVERNMENT MANDATED 

  DUCTION TARGETS, THE WAT R AUTWORlTl  R CARRY OUT WAT R SAVING WORK 

  THEMSELVES OR PURCHASE WATER EFFICIENCY 

  CERTIFICATES FROM OTHERS WHO HAD SAVED WATER 

  ELSEWHERE. 

  19 

  THE ISSUING OF EFFICIENCY CERTIFICATES WOULD ALLOW 

  ACCREDITED SAVED WATER TO BE TRADED FREE FROM 

  ANY PHYSICAL BOUN DARl ES. 

  SUCH A SCHEME WOULD HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON 

  WATER EFFICIENCY ACROSS THE NATION. 

  HOPEFULLY IT WOULD HELP LEAD TO MUCH MORE TAKE 

  UP OF NEW ON FARM IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGY. 

  TO HELP SUPPORT OUR IRRIGATIBN FARPAERS I’VE 

  PERSONALLY PLEDGED UP TO $100 MILLION TO HELP 

  UNDERWRITE INVESTMENT IN NEW ON-FARM IRRIGATION 

  TECHNOLOGY BY FARMERS. 

  THOSE FARMERS WHO’VE MADE INVESTMENT IN MORE 

  EFFICIENT ON-FARM IRRIGATION ALWAYS SING ITS  PRAISES. 

  AS THE PRICE OF WATER RISES - AS IT MUST - THE COST  BENEFITS OF WATER SAVING IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGIES 

  WILL IMPROVE DRAMATICALLY. 

  SOMETIMES IT CAN YEAR PAYBACK. 

  BUT MANY OF OUR FARMERS LACK THE FUNDS TO 

  PROCEED. OR THEY SEE THE RISKS AS TOO GREAT. 

  20 

  SO PRATT WATER HAS TEAMED WITH THE ANZ BANK ARM, 

  ESANDA TO OFFER SPECIAL LEASING PACKAGES TO 

  FARMERS WHO WANT TO SWITCH TO DRIP IRRIGATION. 

  BY USING SOME OF MY $100 MILLION PLEDGE AS 

  SECURITY, THE BANK CAN OFFER FARMERS A MORE 

  COMPETITIVE RATE AND PROVIDE FINANCE TO SOME 

  FARMERS WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET IT 

  ANYWHERE ELSE. 

  WHY WOULD I DO THAT? BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S  IMPORTANT TO SET AN EXAMPLE AND TO DEMONSTRATE 

  WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED IF WE SET OUR MIND TO DO 

  SOMETHING. 

  AND BESIDES, I THINK THERE'S VERY LITTLE DOWNSIDE  RISK. 

  THIS YEAR WILL BE THE FIRST FULL YEAR THAT THE 

  PRODUCT HAS BEEN MARKETED IN THE MURRUMBIDGEE. 

  SO FAR THE LEVEL OF INTEREST HAS NOT BEEN HIGH AND 

  WE'VE ONLY MADE A FEW LOANS. WE'LL SOON BE 

  REVIEWING THE PRODUCT TO SEE JUST WHY THAT IS AND 

  HOW IT CAN BE MAD 

  21 

  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I SAID IT'S TIME TO STOP 

  TALKING AND START DOING BEACUSE THERE IS SO MUCH 

  TO BE DONE. 

  BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE CASE FOR 

  ACTION TODAY ON A PROJECT WHICH HAS BEEN TALKED 

  ABOUT FOR 30 - YES 30 - YEARS 

  FOR THAT LENGTH OF TIME THE NSW GOVERNMENT HAS 

  BEEN DISCUSSING WHAT I'LL CALL THE "MENINDEE- 

  DARLING-ANABRANCH WATER-SAVING OPPORTUNITY'' 

  IT'S WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE IS SCOPE FOR  HUGE WATER SAVINGS WITHIN THE LOWER DARLING 

  SYSTEM. 

  BUT DESPITE 30 YEARS OF TALKING, NO SIGNIFICANT  WORK HAS COMMENCED. THE MAIN REASONS ARE A LACK 

  OF POLITICAL WILL AND THE ABSENCE OF A ROBUST 

  MECHANISM TO FUND AND MANAGE THE WORKS. 

  BASED ON PRATT WATER'S WORK IN THE MURRUMBIDGEE 

  VALLEY, WE'VE DEVISED A MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE  PACKAGE TO HELP MAKE THIS PROJECT HAPPEN. IT 

  INCLUDES: 

  0 IMPROVED WATER SUPPLY SECURITY FOR 

  THE CITY OF BROKEN HILL 

  0 HIGHER SECURITY FOR THE REGION'S 

  HORTICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT AND,  22 

  0 MAJOR WATER SAVINGS FROM AN 

  ANABRANCH STOCK & DOMESTIC WATER 

  SUPPLY PI PEL IN E 

  A GOVERNMENT ESTIMATE FOR THE COST OF THE  ANABRANCH PIPELINE ALONE IS $52 MILLION. 

  BUT PRATT WATER HAS SHOWN THAT THE PIPELINE 

  DESIGN CAN BE GREATLY IMPROVED AND BUILT FOR WELL 

  UNDER $40 MILLION. 

  MORE IMPORTANTLY THERE WOULD BE A MAJOR WIN FOR 

  REGIONAL JOBS AND INVESTMENT IF AN INTEGRATED,  PUBLIC-PRIVATE INVESTMENT APPROACH WAS TAKEN. 

  OUR PROPOSED PROJECT HAS THREE COMPONENTS: 

  FIRSTLY, IT WOULD PROVIDE A STOCK AND DOMESTIC 

  WATER SUPPLY PIPELINE FOR THE DARLING ANABRANCH 

  PASTORAL COM M U N IT1 ES. 

  CURRENTLY THIS SYSTEM RELEASES MORE THAN  50 

  GIGALITRES A YEAR BUT THE PASTORAL REQUIRMENT IS 

  ONLY 3 GIGALITRES. LOSSES IN THE SYSTEM ARE A 

  MASSIVE 94%. SO PIPING THE SYSTEM WOULD SAVE 

  47 GIGALITR 

  THE SECOND COMPONENT IS TO PROVIDE A SECURE 

  WATER SUPPLY FOR THE CITY OF BROKEN HILL. 

  23 

  THE THIRD COMPNENT IS TO UNDERTAKE 

  INFRASTRUCTURE WORKS IN MENINDEE LAKES TO BETTER 

  UTlLlSE THE AVAILABLE WATER RESOURCES. 

  THIS THIRD STEP ALONE WOULD SAVE 6 TO 10 GIGALITRES  ON AVERAG , AND UP TO 100GIGALITRES IN THE DRIEST 

  YEARS. 

  OUR BUSINESS CASE IDENTIFIES NEW WAYS OF 

  SIGNIFICANTLY LEVERAGING GOVERNMENT FUNDS WITH 

  ADDITIONAL PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT TO CREATE 

  SUSTAINABLE WATER SAVINGS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT 

  AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES. 

  THE PROJECT  IS STRUCTURED AROUND A CONCESSION 

  DEED FRAMEWORK SUCH AS I OUTLINED EARLIER. 

  THE VALUE RELEASED IN THE MORE THAN 50 GIGALITRES 

  OF SAVED WATER EACH YEAR WOULD BE USED TO HELP 

  MEET CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS. 

  THE PROJECT RISKS WOULD BE SHARED BETWEEN THE 

  PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS WITH THE PRIVATE 

  SECTOR SPONSOR TAKING THE CONSTRUCTION AND 

  OPERATING COST RISKS. 

  THE WATER SAVINGS COULD BE ALLOCATED BETWEEN 

  ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS AND NEW WATER FOR REGIONAL 

  DEVELOPMENT. THE VAST MAJORITY WOULD  GO TO THE 

  ENVl RON M ENT. 

  24 

  THE REMAINING REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT WATER COULD 

  BE AVAILABLE VIA PUBLIC OFFER, FOR USE WITHIN THE 

  LOWER DARLING REGION. 

  A NUMBER OF FINANCING SCENARIOS AND SENSITIVITIES 

  HAS BEEN MODELLED. THE BASE CASE INVOLVES PRIVATE 

  EQUITY OF $10M AND PUBLIC SECTOR CAPITAL OF $26M 

  INVESTED FOR A 15-YEAR CONCESSION PERIOD. 

  THIS WOULD PRODUCE A RATE  OF RETURN ACCEPTABLE 

  TO AN INVESTOR WHO CAN BENEFIT FROM THE VALUE- 

  ADDING OPPORTUNITIES OF GAINING ACCESS TO SOME OF  THE WATER SAVINGS SUCH AS THROUGH AGRICULTURAL 

  PRODUCTION. 

  THE CONCESSION DEED MODEL I’VE OUTLINED WOULD 

  DELIVER A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF GOVERNMENT 

  FUNDS, PLUS SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL AND 

  REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT BENEFITS COMPARED WITH A 

  CONVENTIONAL “GOVERNMENT GRANT” APPROACH. 

  IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BENEFIT FROM 

  THE TRANSFER OF CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATING 

  COSTS TO TH 

  25 

  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I’VE OUTLINED THAT PROPOSAL 

  AS A WAY OF ILLUSTRATING THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND 

  THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE 

  WATER SAVINGS, BENEFIT THE ENVIRONMENT AND 

  STIMULATE THE REGIONAL ECONOMY. 

  HOPEFULLY IT PROVIDES A MODEL FOR GOVERNMENTS 

  AND WATER AUTHORITIES TO STOP TALKING AND START 

  DOING. 

  BECAUSE IF AN ELEGANT PROJECT SUCH AS THIS ONE 

  CANNOT GET OFF THE GROUND, THEN HEAVEN HELP THE 

  MULTITUDE OF OTHER WORTHY WATER SAVINGS 

  PROJECTS WHICH ARE JUST WAITING FOR A SPONSOR 

  AND SOME POLITICAL WILL. 

  THERE’S A LOT MORE TO SAY. BUT TIME  IS SHORT SO I DO 

  WANT TO SAY ONE FINAL THING. SINCE I’VE FIRST 

  STARTED TALKING ABOUT WATER, LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE 

  TRIED TO WORK OUT MY MOTIVATIONS. 

  SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED I WANT TO SELL PLASTIC  PIPES. 

  LET ME SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT. MY COMPANIES 

  PLASTIC PIPES. 

  26 

  MY TEAM HAS HELPED ONE COMPANY, GALE PACIFIC, 

  COME UP WITH LOWER COST PLASTIC PIPES WHICH 

  DRAMATICALLY BRING DOWN THE COST OF INVESTING IN 

  WATER SAVING INFRASTRUCTURE. 

  I DON’T WANT TO SELL PLASTIC PIPES. BUT I DO HAVE A 

  VESTED INTEREST IN ENSURING THE LONG TERM GROWTH 

  AND SUSTAl NAB1 LlTY OF AUSTRALIAN AGRl CU LTU RE. 

  MY COMPANIES HAVE BEEN BUILT ON SUPPLYING A WIDE 

  RANGE OF PACKAGING TO THE AUSTRALIAN FOOD AND 

  BEVERAGE INDUSTRIES. 

  ANYTHING  I CAN DO TO PROMOTE THEIR GROWTH WILL BE 

  GOOD FOR MY BUSINESS. 

  OF COURSE IT WILL HELP MY COMPETITORS AS WELL. AND 

  I DON’T SEE THEM CAMPAIGNING ON THIS ISSUE. 

  MY MAIN MOTIVATIONS ARE GENUINELY ALTRUISTIC. THIS 

  COUNTRY HAS BEEN GOOD TO ME. I’D LIKE TO THINK I’D  HELPED MAKE A LASTING POSITIVE DIFFERENCE TO IT 

  BEFORE I FALL OFF THE TWIG. 

  BUT I WILL SAY THIS. I’VE LEARNED ENOUGH TO KNOW  THAT TH 

  OPPORTUNITIES IN WATER AND VALUE ADDED 

  AGRICULTURE ONCE WE GET THE BASICS RIGHT. 

  BUT THAT’S NOT WHAT’S MOTIVATING ME.

  I’M MOTIVATED BECAUSE I’VE BECOME CONVINCED THAT 

  ALL AUSTRALIANS REALISE THAT WATER IS ONE OF THE 

  BIGGEST CHALLENGES FACING THIS COUNTRY FOR THE 

  FUTURE. 

  I BELIEVE THAT IF WE GET WATER RIGHT, OUR RURAL 

  REGIONS CAN LOOK FORWARD TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE 

  THAN AT ANY TIME IN THEIR HISTORY. 

  OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY OTHER THINGS WE HAVE TO  DO. BUT GETTING WATER RIGHT ISN’T JUST ONE OF THOSE 

  THINGS. IT’S THE THING. 

  THANKS FOR LISTENING.
