 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - outside  Australian Uranium and Rare Earths Conference  Fremantle  July 17, 2013 

 

 E & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:         Carbon Price, Uranium, James Price Point, Asylum Seekers   

 QUESTION:  What about the new transition on the carbon price? What’s expected to  impact on the mining industry in your eyes?   

 GARY:           What we’ll see is from July 1 of next year a move to the ETS on the model  that had been previous described.  So what we’ll see is the carry-through of  the carbon price to a floating price which will more closely match the current  European price, one would imagine, and which will precisely match the global  price come July 1 next year.  That will see a reduction in the price of carbon  that will pass through to lower power bills for industry, for families, for the  community, and it will be a good thing.   

 QUESTION:   The Coalition has described the removal of the fringe tax benefit concession  as a huge blow for the industry. What’s your take on that?   

 GRAY:            Well the Coalition would describe an initiative by the Labor Government in  dire and diabolical terms. These are proportionate measures that are  designed to raise revenue for a good purpose. And that good purpose is to  bring forward the carbon price float to July 1 next year. It’s been done in a  responsible way and it’s been done in a way that fairly shares the burden  across our community. 

 

 QUESTION:   So you don’t think it will impact on the car industry?   

 GARY:            I think that where you’ll find the impacts are in family power bills and in utility  prices that businesses and customers face throughout the country. That’s a  good thing. And the call which the Cabinet made to fund the $4 billion cost of  the more rapid transition to a floating price for carbon is one that I think will be  broadly supported by the community, who are wanting to see lower power  prices and this does that.   

 QUESTION:   Mr Gray each year a group protests out the front of this conference - not  wanting uranium. This year they’ve decided not to protest; they’ve decided to 

 hold their own conference and have a renewable energy conference. How  does that make you feel that they are rivalling it and the fact they are going to  do everything they can to stop Toro Energy from mining uranium?   

 GRAY:            I attended a uranium conference today; I was invited to do so many months  ago. And I usually do attend the Fremantle uranium conference. Yesterday, I  attended a renewable energy conference hosted by Murdoch University.  Renewable technologies are critically important to energy supply, in our  nation and in our world, for future generations.  This isn’t a matter of one or  the other. It’s a matter of how do we meet growing global demand for  electricity to build better lives, to build better communities, and also reduce  the carbon footprint that people have on our globe. We do it through a  sensible, careful consideration of our energy options. That must include  renewables and it also includes nuclear options. 

 

 QUESTION:   (WA Premier) Colin Barnett says there’s a conflict with the Federal  Government over the Browse licence renewals. What happens there if  Barnett simply refuses to agree to changing the conditions there? 

 

 GRAY:            I have made very clear throughout my time as Minister that I both respect  Premier Barnett’s position and I understand it. I understand it from the point of  view of a preference for an onshore development for the Browse gas fields.  And the original retention leases were specific in requiring the Joint Venture  to develop the Browse gas fields onshore at James Price Point. The operator  and the Joint Venturer then concluded that that was not the most commercial  option available to them. As the Federal Minister, and as the person  responsible for the management of retention leases in Commonwealth  waters, I need to take note of that reality. It’s my view that the great  opportunity for the Kimberley coast; for Western Australia; and for our nation;  is to ensure the timely development of the Browse hydrocarbons fields. 

 

 QUESTION:   But can that happen without the state on board?   

 GRAY:            I believe it should happen for the interests of the Kimberley coast; Western  Australia and Australia and I believe that in Colin Barnett we have a good  premier who does his work very well; whose interests are acutely the interests  of Western Australia. My interest, as the Commonwealth Minister for  Resources, has to be the Kimberley coast’s interests, Western Australia’s  interest and also the national interest and we must ensure the development of  that resource in a timely fashion. Our customers are seeing gas come to them  now through a range of other sources. We have massive discoveries off East  Africa; and the availability of pipeline gas into Asia out of Russia. With those  threats to our market from both the supply and the demand side, and with the  commerciality of James Price Point onshore falling over, it’s necessary for the  Commonwealth to look to other solutions to ensure that the retention lease  allows the project proponents the broadest possible set of options to ensure  a   development in the Browse. 

 

 QUESTION:   You said you welcomed Cameco’s position on foreign ownership of uranium  mines in Canada, is there any lobbying going on behind the scenes by  yourselves in that regard? 

 

 GRAY:            I met with the Canadian High Commissioner shortly after taking on this job;  that followed a lot of work that my predecessor Martin Ferguson had done;  that followed direct lobbying and engagement in Canada by my predecessor  Martin Ferguson. So we’ve continued a position that says there should be 

 reciprocity in the way in which our two governments encourage and welcome  investors into uranium.   

 QUESTION:   Do you agree there needs to be a streamlining of the approvals process at the  state and Federal levels?   

 GRAY:            Approvals processes vary depending on the environment in which we  operate. We’ve already made moves, which I announced at APPEA in May,  to better align the approvals process in the offshore Commonwealth waters  and state waters environment. And I’m sure that that work will produce a  better and quicker way of both getting approvals in place but also ensuring  that those approvals protect the environment in the most effective possible  way. What we also see in different mineralisations, in natural gas from coal  seams, or natural gas from shales, or coal mining or iron ore mining or  uranium mining as we’re discussing here, that there are interactions between  the Commonwealth and the state that should be done as efficiently and  effectively as possible. 

 

 QUESTION:   On another note, Tony Abbott has declared the issue of asylum seekers as a  national emergency and wants to recall Parliament to discuss the issue. Do  you agree it’s an emergency and would recalling Parliament solve anything? 

 

 GRAY:            The last time the Parliament was recalled to debate these issues; Mr Abbott  refused to cooperate with the government in order to implement the  recommendations of the report that had been done by Angus Houston into  the best measures that the Parliament could take to ensure this issue is dealt  with. I find it disappointing that Mr Abbott would once again seek just to find  political opportunity and mileage out of this issue. So often in the life of a  parliamentarian you see things that uplift you and that allow you to be really  optimistic about our future. And then along comes Tony Abbott.  

                         Thank you very much.
