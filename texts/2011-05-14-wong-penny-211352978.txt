 TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, BRISBANE   

 SUBJECT: BUDGET 2011-12.   

 E  & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 

 WONG: Thanks very much for coming. It’s great to be here in Brisbane, enjoying a bit of  Queensland sun. Today I’m here in Brisbane to come to a Labor Women’s Conference and  that’s been great to see women from all over Australia - from Cairns, from Adelaide, from  Western Australia talking about issues important to women.    

 But what I want to talk about today is the Budget because this week the Gillard Government  handed down a budget that was all about what’s right for the country. This is a budget that  was good for the country. A budget that gets Australia back in the black. It’s a budget all  about jobs, about creating jobs, about training more Australians for jobs and getting more  Australians into work. A budget that’s good for the country.   

 What did we see from Mr Abbott this week? Well we saw that Mr Abbott likes a fight and  he’s a pretty good fighter. But enjoying fighting is not the same thing as leading. And liking  a fight is not the same thing as putting forward a plan for the nation. So we have the  Government with its budget, all about jobs and getting Australia back in the black. And we  have Mr Abbott who just wants to throw punches. Happy to take questions.   

 JOURNALIST: The Galaxy poll this morning wasn’t too nice to the budget. What are your  thoughts on that?    

 WONG: The only numbers I’m focused on are the 500,000 jobs that will be created in the  years ahead and getting the Budget back into black by 2012-13 as we promised. And that’s  what this budget will deliver.    

 JOURNALIST: Is that how you’re going to win people over then?    

 WONG: We’ll just keep doing what’s right for the country. And what’s right for this country is  this budget, getting more Australians into work, creating more jobs and getting Australia  back in the black.

 JOURNALIST: So the poll doesn’t concern you?    

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible) Worried less than 50 per cent of Labor voters said it was good  for you?    

 WONG: As I said, there’s really only one set of numbers I’m worried about. That’s making  sure we get back into surplus by 2012-13 and that’s what this budget will do. Of course, the  concern is what the Opposition will do. This is the most economically irresponsible  Opposition the nation’s seen. They haven’t even committed to bringing the budget back to  surplus and we know what that would do is put costs of living pressures on Australian  families.    

 JOURNALIST: The Government is hell bent on restoring the budget back to surplus by  2013. And at the same time restoring its reputation as good economic managers. But the  Galaxy poll shows that people are not convinced at all.    

 WONG: All I can say is this: we put forward a budget about what is good for the country.   We put forward a budget that is about creating jobs. We put forward a budget that’s about  training more Australians for those jobs and getting more Australians into work. And we put  forward a budget that has us back in the black. That’s positive policy. That’s the right thing  for the nation.    

 JOURNALIST: Is there any room to actually train refugees for these skilled positions, or  asylum seekers?    

 WONG: We have made clear our priority is to train Australians first and that’s why this  budget invests in the skills of Australians. Invests in working with industry to make training  more relevant to what industry needs. And invests in getting more Australians into the  workforce. These are all good things for Australian families.    

 JOURNALIST: You mentioned Tony Abbott brought up the (inaudible) giving ideas for the  skills shortage in his budget reply speech?    

 WONG: I don’t think Tony Abbott did anything in his budget reply speech other than throw  punches. And like I said, he’s a very good fighter, he clearly enjoys fighting but that’s not  the same thing as leading. That's not the same thing as doing the right thing for the country.    

 JOURNALIST: So you're not at all concerned by the poll results today?    

 WONG: As I said, we're focused on the key numbers, which is coming back to surplus and  the jobs that are going to be created on top of the jobs we've already seen been created  under this Government.    

 JOURNALIST: There's a lot of talk at the women's conference about the gender pay gap  and legislating to eliminate it. It's a pretty hard thing to legislate away given it's caused  mainly by women having lower paid jobs and (inaudible) to raise children.    

 WONG: Ensuring that we have pay equity in Australia is something Labor has fought for  many years. The Prime Minister delivered the pay equity provisions in the Fair Work Act

 and we removed the legislation - the WorkChoices legislation - which was bad for working  people and bad for working women; legislation that remember, Tony Abbott was a very  strong supporter of.    

 JOURNALIST: Anne Summers says that child care arrangements in Australia are still  keeping women out of the workforce. What do you say to that?    

 WONG: I understand that people will keep advocating for more services but I just remind all  of us that the Labor Party has put more money, invested more into childcare than any  previous government. We've increased the childcare rebate and we've done it because it's  the right thing to do for Australian families and the right thing to do to support women,  particularly returning to the workforce.    

 JOURNALIST: Does more still need to be done?    

 WONG: I'm sure there are always more things governments would like to do. But first, we  always have to find the money to fund them. We are not about making promises that we  can't fund. And that's why we've put forward a budget that makes sure we can fund the  promises we've made and gets Australia back into the black.    

 JOURNALIST: A Labor MP has criticised the (inaudible)?    

 WONG: Absolutely. I think the approach that Tony Burke has outlined makes clear that this  is more than a matter of simply a number. This is about making we have sustainable  communities and sustainable cities and we've put forward a range of policies to achieve  that.    

 JOURNALIST: There was a lot of talk at the women's conference by women there about  the advances made for women under Labor governments. Has there been any talk about  the recent crackdown on benefits for supporting single mothers in their teens?    

 WONG: Well I don't accept the way in which your question is put. What is our motivation  when it comes to reforms around teen parents? It's about giving those mothers, those  women, a better chance and it's about giving their kids a better chance. It's about getting  more people into work, about supporting teen mums - not just in parenting but in finishing  school or finishing the training they need so they have a better chance later in life and so do  their kids. It's the right thing to do.    

 JOURNALIST: Why does it have to have a punitive condition that their be benefits will be  withdrawn if they don't comply?    

 WONG: I don't think there's anything wrong with ensuring people also take responsibility. I  don't think it is a progressive thing, a good thing for those children or those parents to  simply accept that people should stay on welfare for years. We need to do all we can to  give those families opportunities in life and that's what we'll do. Thanks very much.
