  Thank you John (Kerin).   

  I am very pleased to be able to speak to you on the occasion of your 2004 Annual  General Meeting (AGM).   

  Racial Respect is composed of academics, former diplomats, former public servants, and  people generally concerned with issues of race and human rights.  Trevor Boucher was  your first chairman and I understand John Kerin was recruited for that role by Prof Jamie  Mackie, who no doubt saw John as someone well known to favour tolerance in our  diverse multicultural society and as a member of Bob Hawke’s Government which had a  good record in that respect.   

  I also understand that some of the founding members go back to the anti-White Australia  campaign of the 1960s, which no doubt underlines Racial Respect’s commitment to the  elimination of racial discrimination, racial prejudices and bias in public policy against  ethnic minorities.   

  It’s important to get a good AGM under your belt early in the year.  Labor’s equivalent is  our National Conference, held recently.  I’ll start there, by letting you know what we  decided.   

  As part of our platform we resolved to adhere to some basic, but sound and important  principles so far as human rights are concerned.  These include   

  â¢ Respect and support for internationally recognised human rights is fundamental  to an equal, just, democratic, inclusive and tolerant society, and inherent to the  dignity of each and every Australian.   

  â¢ Human rights are enjoyed not only by individuals but collectively by all  Australians.  Respect for the individual and collective rights of others is essential  to the protection and promotion of human rights.   

  â¢ Human rights are essential for the maintenance and enhancement of democracy  and peace.  Labor wants Australia to reassert its role as a world leader in the  promotion and protection of fundamental human rights both domestically and  internationally.   

  â¢ Labor is committed to supporting the international human rights instruments to  which Australia is a signatory including:  - the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;  - the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights;  - the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;  - the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination 

  against Women;  - the International Convention on the Rights of the Child; and  - the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial  

  2 

  Discrimination.   

  â¢ Labor supports both the promotion of human rights internationally and the  development of international standards and mechanisms for the protection and  enforcement of these rights.  Labor will adhere to Australia’s international human  rights obligations and will seek to have them incorporated into the domestic law  of Australia and taken into account in administrative decision making.   

  In this context of our international obligations, so far as immigration is concerned, we  resolved as part of our platform principles that:   

  â¢ Labor will ensure that Australia’s international obligations towards asylum  seekers and refugees are met, and Labor will positively promote the rights of  refugees and asylum seekers.     

  In the immigration, multicultural and ethnic affairs area generally, our platform principles  include the following touchstones:   

  â¢ Australia is a multicultural society.  Labor recognises that it is part of the  Commonwealth’s responsibility to assist all Australians to live together  productively and have an equal sense of opportunity and belonging to the nation.   

  â¢ Labor will positively promote the strength that Australia gains from recognising  and valuing our diversity and will combat prejudice and discrimination aimed at  any migrant community through community education programs and anti-  discrimination legislation.   

  â¢ Labor will ensure immigration levels are set within the framework of a population  policy fashioned in Australia’s interest and consistent with international and  humanitarian commitments.  The system of setting immigration targets year by  year without any underlying rationale or long term policy framework has  contributed to declining public confidence in the program.  Moving to long term  planning will achieve greater stability and confidence.   

  â¢ Labor is committed to maintaining a non-discriminatory immigration policy.   Labor recognises the economic and social contribution that has been made by  immigrants and refugees throughout our nation’s history.  Labor regards  Australia’s diversity as a source of national strength and nation building and will  consistently oppose those who seek to poison Australia’s social cohesion by  fostering extremism, hatred or ethnic division.   

  Our platform principles also detail our approach to asylum seekers and refugees:   

  â¢ Labor will administer a fair and flexible refugee and humanitarian program.   While acknowledging that Australia has one of the world’s most generous  humanitarian programs, Labor will ensure that unforeseen world events that 

  3 

  necessitate special responses can be accommodated.  Labor will examine  immigration intake consistent with a population policy for nation building and  will work with regions seeking population growth to find options to assist  additional immigration.  Labor will ensure that Australia’s non-refoulement  obligations under international law are met.   

  â¢ Labor’s refugee and asylum seeker policy will be in accordance with the  following principles:   

  Ù  That Australia should comply with the letter and the spirit of the obligations  Australia has voluntarily assumed by signing the Refugee Convention and  other relevant international instruments;   

  Ù  That a Labor Government should seek to lead world debate on the new  agreements and understandings required to ensure that the Convention and  the international protection system function effectively over the long term,  including encouraging countries in our region to become signatories to the  existing Refugee Convention;   

  Ù  That a Labor Government should develop further multi-lateral solutions,  recognising the importance of regional neighbours, with the aim of  eradicating people smuggling, deterring secondary movement and enabling  genuine refugees to access processing and appropriate settlement outcomes;   

  Ù  That Australia should seek to eradicate people smuggling, which is an  organised criminal activity that costs lives, by effective law enforcement as  well as relevant international agreements;   

  Ù  That, as a matter of fairness, Australia should seek to assist the world’s most  vulnerable whether those persons are within or beyond our immediate line of  sight;   

  Ù  That Australia should take its fair share of refugees for resettlement and  contribute a fair share to international aid efforts and to UNHCR to alleviate  the pressing humanitarian needs of displaced persons;   

  Ù  That asylum claims made in Australia should be assessed in a manner which  is both fast and affords procedural fairness, with those found to have genuine  claims and not able to be resettled in other Refugee Convention signatory  countries provided with appropriate settlement outcomes and services, while  those without genuine refugee or humanitarian claims are quickly returned;   

  Ù  That mandatory detention be used for the proper administrative purposes of  ensuring the health, identity and security checking of all unauthorised  arrivals, enabling the expediting of processing and ensuring that those whose 

  4 

  claims have failed are locatable and available for removal from Australia;   

  Ù  That the conditions of detention be humane and appropriate to needs of  asylum seekers, with appropriate arrangements made to meet the needs of  unaccompanied children and family groups;   

  Ù  That the length and conditions of detention be subject to review and that  detention centres be managed by the public sector.   

  â¢ Labor will review the current asylum seekers’ appeal mechanism to ensure that  its decision making and operation is both cost efficient, fair and consistent.  While  the rights of asylum seekers to seek judicial review must be maintained, it is  important that a streamlined and more formal system of appeal is instituted to  provide a better filter and alleviate the higher courts’ immigration caseload  burden.   

  â¢ Labor recognises that the Refugee Convention has always envisaged that the  protection of the Convention might not be required on an ongoing basis.   

  â¢ Accordingly, Labor will maintain a Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) system for  unauthorised arrivals.  Labor will introduce a one-off TPV period of two years,  after which, consistent with the Convention, if ongoing protection is still required,  permanent protection will be provided.   

  â¢ Labor will ensure that in addition to existing services, TPV holders have access to  English language training and employment assistance.  Labor will also ensure  appropriate settlement support and alleviate the financial and organisational  burden borne by the States, Territories, welfare and volunteer organisations.   

  These platform commitments were underlined by a National Conference Resolution  entitled ‘The Implementation of Labor’s Refugee and Asylum Seeker Policy in  Government’.   

  That resolution, which will be the guide for Labor in Government, is as follows:   

  Labor believes in an orderly immigration system, a system based on the rule of law, a  system of integrity which the Australian people will have confidence and trust in.   

  For the Australian people to have confidence in the administration of our immigration  system, it must be built upon rigorous procedures and processes, which protect our  national interest and our national borders.   

  We must also treat individuals fairly and with dignity.  To treat individuals fairly requires  that they are dealt with in a speedy and efficient manner, where decisions are based on  fair procedures and subject to appropriate review.   

  5 

  Protecting our national interest and our national borders requires zero tolerance for  people smugglers, who will be subject to harsher penalties to deter their activities and  stop unauthorised boat arrivals.   

  It is also in our national interest to conduct ourselves as a good international citizen, to  do our fair share for those who are subject to persecution and who need protection.   

  Labor in Government will ensure that our borders are secure and that the processing and  detention of asylum seekers is fair.   

  In Government, Labor will:   

  1. Protecting our borders   

  (i) Create an Australian Coastguard   

  (ii) Implement harsh penalties for people smugglers, including life  sentences for the worst of the people smugglers   

  (iii) Effect strong international and regional arrangements to deter  secondary movements of asylum seekers   

  (iv) Continue the excision of Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands  and Ashmore Reef from Australia’s migration zone   

  (v) Introduce a Foreign Worker ID Card to crack down on illegal workers  and protect Australian jobs and conditions, with tough new penalties  for employers who knowingly hire illegal foreign workers   

  

  2. Mandatory Detention  (vi) Maintain mandatory detention as an essential part of Labor’s  approach   

  (vii) Provide open hostel style supervised accommodation for those with  prima facie claims who are not a health, security or absconding risk   

  (viii) Remove children from detention centres and care for unaccompanied  children through foster or community care arrangements, with  children and their family members (subject to health and security  risks) in open hostel style supervised accommodation.   

  (ix) Return detention centres to the public sector, with centres managed by  Commonwealth Officers   

  6 

  (x) Provide access to detention centres for the media and independent  medical professionals   

  (xi) Create an independent Inspector General of Detention to monitor  detention conditions and to deal with complaints   

  3.  Better Processing   (xii) End the so called “Pacific Solution”, with its huge cost to Australian  taxpayers   

  (xiii) Determine 90% of claims within 90 days   

  (xiv) Provide an independent review of those claims not determined in 90  days, with a goal of processing all claims within twelve months   

  (xv) Process claims quickly through a new Refugee Determination  Tribunal, with appeals to Federal Magistrates   

  (xvi) Provide a processing and detention facility on Christmas Island    

  4. Temporary Protection Visas  (xvii) Maintain a Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) system for unauthorised  arrivals with a one-off TPV period of two years, after which, if  ongoing protection is still required, provide permanent protection    

  (xviii) Immediately upon coming to office, conduct a review of the  circumstances of each existing TPV holder of two years or more  duration, giving priority to those who have been on a TPV for the  longest period.  Where a TPV holder has been in the community  longer than two years, if ongoing protection is required, provide  permanent protection  If ongoing protection is no longer required, offer permanent residence  to a TPV holder who passes a rigorous public interest test where it is  found the person is the sort of person who Australia would otherwise  select for a migration program - someone who has made, and can  continue to make, economic , social, community and family  contributions beneficial to the Australian community, particularly  within rural or regional Australia. 

  

  (xix) Enable TPV holders to access English language training and  employment assistance in addition to existing services   

  (xx) Ensure asylum seekers and refugees in the Australian community have,  either through Commonwealth, State or community based services,  appropriate health, income and settlement support, as well as alleviate 

  7 

  the financial and organisational burden currently borne by the States,  Territories, welfare and volunteer organisations   

  Labor’s Minister for Immigration will report to the first National Conference after the  election of a Labor Government on the progress of the implementation of Labor’s refugee  and asylum seeker policy.   

  Having detailed that as the policy framework for a Labor Government, let me now deal in  more detail with one of our very important international human rights obligations, the  Refugee Convention.   

  That Convention arose out of the events of WWII, and the horror of the Holocaust.   

  As well, the Refugee Convention arose out of the start of the Cold War, where people  displaced by the war feared to return to live under Soviet domination.   

  This history saw the colloquial notion of “once a refugee, always a refugee”.   

  Since that context of the 1950s and 1960s, nation states have reconsidered their role and  responsibility to assist with the movement of people seeking protection.   

  In the post Cold War era, new forms of armed conflict flared up and countries who had  previously accommodated refugees no longer received assistance from wealthier donor  states, who viewed that assistance as in exchange for political support pivotal to their  strategic influence during the Cold War.   

  Since the end of the Cold War, the scale and speed of refugee movements has increased  significantly.  You only have to consider the violence and displacement in a number of  African nations to comprehend this, let alone Iran, Iraq or Afghanistan.   

  The aid had dried up.  Countries were struggling to feed their own or maintain order and  good government, let alone sustain movement from neighbouring countries.     

  As a result there was little choice but for refugees to keep moving.    

  As well, arguments for a change of approach associated with the Convention itself have  emerged as new forms of armed conflict saw people requiring the temporary but not  necessarily the permanent protection of either the international community or the  provisions of the Convention.    

  Neither our international political arena nor our international legal framework has yet  adjusted to this new forced mobility of asylum seekers, which has seen the recent public  policy arguments about temporary and complementary protection now emerging as part  of the national and international debate.   

  8 

  Developed countries like Australia have a managed and coordinated migration program  which this secondary movement stands in conflict with.   

  The secondary movement of asylum seekers is a real problem for the modern day.  It  needs addressing, with a coordinated response regionally and internationally, both by the  UNHCR and by individual nation states.   

  Australia has a refugee and humanitarian migration quota of 12,000 each year, which is  currently 10% of our annual migration intake.  Through this quota the UNHCR has  settled thousands of refugees in Australia.     

  The number of people settled in Australia by the UNHCR has increased over the decades  as Australia’s own population has grown, along with our capacity to accommodate  refugees.     

  Humanitarian and refugee intake is but one component of Australia’s immigration  program.  

  The size of the 2003-04 humanitarian program is 12,000 places. 

  

  Our migration program has developed over decades under Federal Governments of both  political persuasions.  Bipartisan support for this program has been seen in the migration  policies of both the Labor Party and the Coalition, so much so that over the years there  have been claims there is no real substantive policy difference between the two major  parties.   

  While that claim can be made about the size and nature of our offshore humanitarian  programme, it certainly can not be made when we talk about the treatment of asylum  seekers who arrive in an unauthorised fashion.   

  This is even more so the case after our National Conference decisions.   

  Labor believes in an orderly immigration system, a system based on the rule of law, a  system of integrity in which the Australian people will have confidence and trust.   

  For the Australian people to have confidence in the administration of our immigration  system, it must be built upon rigorous procedures and processes, which protect our  national interest and our national borders.   

  We must also treat individuals fairly and with dignity.  To treat individuals fairly requires  that they are dealt with in a speedy and efficient manner, where decisions are based on  fair procedures and subject to appropriate review.   

  Protecting our national interest and our national borders requires zero tolerance for  people smugglers, who will be subject to harsher penalties to deter their activities and  stop unauthorised boat arrivals.   

  9 

  It is also in our national interest to conduct ourselves as a good international citizen, to do  our fair share for those who are subject to persecution and who need protection.   

  Labor in Government will ensure both that our borders are secure and that the processing  and detention of asylum seekers is both civilised and fair.   

  So far as mandatory detention is concerned, Labor proposes to maintain mandatory  detention, to ensure that in the first instance people who come here in an unauthorised  way are checked for identity, health, quarantine and security.     

  But we say you can also have graduations of detention.     

  And the best example of graduations of detention is no children in detention, kids out.     

  And you can also ensure with sensible graduations that we can have families living in  residential style hostels with discreet supervision and discreet security, on the model that  you can see at Port Augusta.       

  And we believe it is essential that if the Commonwealth has to detain people, they are  detained by Commonwealth officers on Commonwealth territory.  The best way of  ensuring accountability and transparency is to ensure the Commonwealth is responsible  and accountable and that accountability is transparent.  That’s why as well we say we  need an Inspector General of Detention and sensible media access, and sensible access to  medical services as well.   

  And we believe we can do 90% of claims in 90 days with a target of all claims done in 12  months and an independent review of all claims that aren’t processed or successfully  completed in 90 days.     

  So far as Temporary Protection Visas are concerned, John Howard believes that  Temporary Protection Visas somehow operate as a form of deterrent to unauthorised  arrivals.  If it is such an effective deterrent, why then have we had nearly 9,000 people  come here on his watch who are now out there in the Australian community?   

  We say there is a role for Temporary Protection Visas, but only if that role is consistent  with the Refugee Convention.     

  While this point is often forgotten, the Refugee Convention always envisaged that there  would be circumstances where the ongoing protection of the Convention was not  required.     

  Under Labor’s model, an unauthorised person who comes here and is determined to be a  refugee, will go on a Temporary Protection Visa for a one-off period of two years, after  which if the ongoing protection of that person is required, and the onus of that will be on  the Commonwealth, then that person has a pathway to permanency.   

  10 

  We also have to deal with John Howard’s TPV backlog.  What do we do with the 9,000  people out there on a Temporary Protection Visa?     

  Now it would be easy for us to ignore that issue but we have to front it and confront it.     

  At the moment of those almost 9,000 people on Temporary Protection Visas nearly 4,000  have been in the community for 3 years.  By the end of this year, over 7,000 people will  have been in the Australian community on a Temporary Protection Visa for three to four  years.     

  We say two years is an appropriate time to make a judgement.  Two years is an  appropriate period to give protection, but after that period a different public policy  consideration comes into play.     

  And so we say that if the ongoing protection under the Refugee Convention is not  required, in the case of those people who have been here on a Temporary Protection Visa  for two years or more, you can make a judgement which is, are these people who have  been out and about in the Australian community making their family, community, social  and economic contacts, are these the sorts of people who in any event Australia would  want as part of our migration intake?     

  The Refugee Convention requires that we give protection to people who have a well  founded fear of persecution, either because of the group or class of people they come  from, or because of their religious beliefs or because of their political opinion.     

  The test is not is it safe to go back to a country.  That is the test we use when we  determine whether a failed asylum seeker can be returned to their country of origin.  Our  commitment is not to send someone back when there is a fear or threat to their livelihood  or life.     

  But the TPV test is if the ongoing protection under the Convention is required because  there is a fear of persecution.  And if there is a fear of persecution they will not go home.   They will stay here.  That is the Convention obligation and that it what we will do.     

  Another element of this debate that has to be confronted is the so called Pacific Solution.     

  Labor says the Pacific Solution has to go.   

  The Government has backed itself into a corner but it now needs to acknowledge that  there is no longer any viability for the so-called Pacific Solution.   

  That is certainly the case with Manus Island, with Papua New Guinea (PNG) Prime  Minister, Sir Michael Somare, confirming last week that there will be no extension of the  Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) between PNG and Australia at the end of this  year.   

  11 

  Let’s hope it doesn’t take that long to end the extraordinarily expensive farce which sees  the Government outlaying $216,000 per month to keep one asylum seeker on Manus  Island.  One asylum seeker who now has the run of the island.   

  It would make more sense to close the detention centre and make a modest contribution  to his hotel bill!   

  And this week there have been reports that the lone asylum seeker on Manus Island,  Aladdin Sisalem would prefer to go to Nauru than remain alone in Papua New Guinea.   

  The Government has got itself into such a ludicrous mess over the Pacific Solution that  I’m sure they would prefer to leave Manus Island detention centre empty of detainees  rather than admit it has been a waste of tax payers money.   

  The Government argues that the Pacific Solution is a deterrent to people smugglers and  unauthorised arrivals.  This is frankly a complete nonsense.  We note that the boats have  stopped, because firstly, Saddam Hussein who was once a tyrant in Iraq is now a prisoner  of war, the Taliban have effectively been banished from many or most regions of  Afghanistan.  That’s why the boats have stopped coming.     

  As well, the boats have stopped coming, because after doing nothing for four or five year,  the Government finally sat down with our neighbours, in particular Indonesia, and  entered into agreements so far as secondary movements and people smuggling are  concerned.     

  I don’t think that the good folk in the coffee shops of Kabul or Bagdad are sitting there  saying we’re not proposing to come to Australia because there’s a lone fellow on Manus  Island.   

  While acute embarrassment about the cost to the taxpayer may shame the Government  into closing Manus Island, it will in my view be the actions of the UNHCR that propels  the Government into action in closing Nauru.   

  As you may be aware, on Christmas Eve the UNHCR announced that it would reassess  the cases of 22 Afghans it had previously determined not to be refugees on the basis of  changed circumstance in various regions of Afghanistan.   

  The UNHCR visited Nauru last week and conducted interviews with detainees.  While I  have no especial or indeed any information or knowledge about these interviews, the  Melbourne ‘Age’ has reported that of the 22, 9 had been reassessed as refugees.  I  understand the remaining assessments are now awaiting further advice from the  UNHCR’s country report of Afghanistan and other relevant information necessary to  finalise the assessment process.   

  I would hazard a guess that whatever the number, the UNHCR would assess some of the  Nauru Afghan asylum seekers as refugees, some not refugees but failed asylum seekers, 

  12 

  who would fall into two categories: those whom it was safe to return home, whether  home was Afghanistan or Pakistan, and those in respect of whom it was not safe to return  to their respective regions of Afghanistan.   

  Presumably those assessed as refugees will be resettled by the UNHCR and the  Australian Government in a similar fashion to previously assessed refugees from Nauru  and Manus Island - namely the vast majority settled in Australia and New Zealand, and  small numbers settled in third countries.     

  It is already the case that 379 refugees from Nauru and Manus Island have been settled in  Australia, 370 in New Zealand, and 37 people settled in Sweden, Canada, Denmark and  Norway.   

  On the basis that those who can be safely returned home are returned home, what then  does the Howard Government do with those failed asylum seekers in respect of whom it  is not safe to return to relevant regions in Afghanistan?     

  Keep them on Nauru until it is safe for them to return?  (And by the way, to continue to  leave them on Nauru on the pretence that that somehow provides a deterrent to  unauthorised arrivals, an assertion that is now beginning to defy credulity).   

  Move them to Christmas Island?     

  Find a third party nation state happy to take them on a humanitarian basis?     

  Or bring them to mainland Australia on a transitional basis pending further developments  in their country of origin?   

  This issue will shortly seize Minister Vanstone and the Howard Government.   

  While it took Minister Vanstone nearly three weeks to do it clearly, the Australian  Government has faithfully undertaken to reconsider the 182 Afghans on Nauru originally  assessed by DIMIA officers on the same basis as the UNHCR reconsideration.   

  Presumably that will lead to a similar outcome - some refugees, same not and of those,  some not safe to return home.   

  Minister Vanstone and the Government should now play smart - accept that Nauru is  over and put in place the necessary transitional arrangements to effect that.   

  If they do so, no one will welcome it more than Labor.     

  We will respond positively and favourably to whatever transitional arrangements or  measures the Government sensibly wants to put in place, whether that’s a move to  Christmas Island, a third party nation state or mainland Australia.   

  13 

  As well, it also follows logically that if the Australian Government has agreed to  reconsider the cases of Afghans on Nauru on the basis of changed circumstances in  certain areas of Afghanistan, then presumably those changed circumstances will apply  equally to the cases of any relevant Afghan asylum seeker currently in immigration  detention on the Australian mainland.   

  In addition to the Afghans on Nauru, the Government is also confronted with the logical  dilemma of the remaining Iraqis on Nauru.  On its own admission, the Government has  frozen consideration of any Further Protection Visa applications made by Iraqis on  Temporary Protection Visas in Australia.  It seems happy to do that for an indefinite  period, but it can’t leave the Iraqis on Nauru in a state of suspended animation forever.   

  When it comes to asylum seekers Labor:   

  Stands for a fair refugee and humanitarian program;    

  Supports the Refugee Convention and voluntary acceptance of the need to comply with  it;   

  Will do our fair share in humanitarian services as a good international citizen;   

  Supports the deterrence of secondary movements;   

  Supports the eradication of people smuggling;   

  Supports the speedy processing with procedural fairness; and   

  Wants mandatory detention maintained in a humane way, not in a punitive way, and  managed by Commonwealth officers on Commonwealth territory.   

  Labor understands you’ve got to ensure that people are dealt with fairly, that they are  dealt with dignity, and that they are dealt with civility.   

  You can have an immigration system which protects the national interest, which secures  our border, but at the same time treats people who come here with civility and fairness.   

  Labor’s policy is well founded in general terms on three principles, three principles that  Labor has always attached itself to.   

  The first principal is formulating policy on the basis of protecting and defending the  national interest.  Protecting and defending and securing our borders.  That is a principle  that we have held dear as a Party.  It’s also something that is very important to the  Australian community.   

  The second principle is adherence to international obligations.  And that we do through  our adherence to the Refugee Convention.   

  14 

  15 

  

  And the third principle, is the simple, well founded basis that whoever comes to us,  whoever comes to us seeking our protection, is dealt with civilly, dealt with dignity and  dealt with fairly.   

  Without going into the detail of John Howard’s policy, the fundamental difference  between our approach and Howard’s approach is that Howard wants to use this issue  politically, operating on the fear of people and demeaning those people who come here  seeking our protection.     

  Our approach is not to operate on fear.  It is to operate on a good public policy basis.   And to treat people with civility, dignity and respect.
