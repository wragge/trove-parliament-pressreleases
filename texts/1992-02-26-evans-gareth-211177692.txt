  Emergency Funds to Assist Rohingya Refugees 

  Australia will provide emergency relief funds worth $250,000 to assist Rohingya  refugees in Bangladesh, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator  Gareth Evans, announced today. 

  The Rohingyas, an Islamic minority from Burma (Myanmar), are arriving in  Bangladesh at an estimated one thousand a day. They claim to be fleeing their  homeland in fear of persecution. 

  Australia has made strong representations to Burma, calling on the Burmese  authorities to observe internationally accepted human rights standards in its  treatment of the Rohingyas and other minority groups. 

  Up to 55,000 Rohingya refugees are currently living in five camps in the Cox's  Bazar region of Bangladesh, according to current reports. 

  "Conditions in the camps are reported to be grim. The situation is expected to  worsen as the present influx of refugees continues or increases. With the arrival of  the monsoon rains in a few months' time, conditions can be expected to deteriorate  still further," Senator Evans said. 

  Australia's contribution will be channelled through non-government organisations  and United Nations agencies working in the camps. The funds will be used for  medicines, water supplies, sanitation and shelter. 

  Australian support for Rohingya refugees forms part of Australia's official  program of overseas development cooperation administered by AIDAB, the  Australian International Development Assistance Bureau.
