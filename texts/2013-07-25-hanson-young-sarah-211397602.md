 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Thursday, 25 July 2013   

 Race to refugee cruelty in overdrive   

 The Coalition’s asylum policy is simply a dressed up version of the same old cruelty and neither  of the old parties are offering the new way on refugee policy that this country needs, the  Australian Greens have said.   

 “It’s not people smuggling that’s being smashed here, it’s Australia’s global reputation,” the  Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The old parties’ war on refugees is totally unacceptable and shows just how far they are willing  to go to win the race to the bottom.   

 "Both Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott have lost touch with what it means for Australia to be a decent and  caring country.   

 “The gulags on Nauru and Manus Island are a disaster now and will be future humanitarian time bomb.   

 “Tony Abbott's military rhetoric is deliberately inflammatory and grossly irresponsible.   

 “This is not a national emergency, it’s a humanitarian emergency.   

 “What we need to see is  a  commitment to a  genuine regi onal approach that cares for refugees with the  kind of political leadership shown after the Vietnam War.   

 “The Houston Panel recommended Australia take 3,800 refugees out of Indonesia, giving them a  safer pathway to protection.   

 “The Greens care for refugees and want to see them given a safer way to reach protection than  a dangerous boat journey from Indonesia.”
