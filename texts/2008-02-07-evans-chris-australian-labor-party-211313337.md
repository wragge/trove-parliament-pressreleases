 Minister refuses protection visa for people smuggler 

 Thursday, 7 February 2008 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans today refused an  application for a Protection visa by an Iraqi asylum seeker convicted and jailed for people  smuggling. 

 Senator Evans said he had refused the application by Ali Al Jenabi on character grounds  due to the serious nature of his crime. 

 'The Rudd Government deplores people smuggling. It is a heinous crime that puts lives at  risk, undermines Australia's border security and weakens our immigration system,' Senator  Evans said. 

 'For those reasons I have refused Mr Al Jenabi’s application for a Protection visa on  character grounds.' 

 Australia has protection obligations to Mr Al Jenabi under the Refugees Convention which  means he cannot currently be returned to Iraq. 

 Senator Evans said to avoid holding Mr Al Jenabi in indefinite detention he had granted Mr  Al Jenabi a Removal Pending Bridging visa. 

 'Indefinite detention is an unacceptable option,' Senator Evans said. 

 Mr Al Jenabi has spent almost 20 months in limbo in the Villawood Immigration Detention  Centre after serving four years of an eight year prison term in Darwin. 

 He was transferred to Villawood after being released from prison in June 2006 when he  then made an application for a Protection visa. 

 The former Minister failed to deal with Mr Al Jenabi’s application within the required 90 day  timeframe and the matter became subject to protracted litigation. 

 Senator Evans said that while people smuggling was an abhorrent crime, Mr Al Jenabi  could not be detained at Villawood indefinitely and the matter had to be resolved. 

 'The previous Government put Mr Al Jenabi’s case in the too hard basket and failed to deal  with it for 18 months despite being required to make a decision within 90 days,' Senator  Evans said. 'In fact, the Federal Court described the former Government’s indecision on  the matter as an ‘egregious failure by the (then) minister’.' 

 Senator Evans said that although Australia had protection obligations to Mr Al Jenabi, the  serious nature of his crimes had to be balanced with those obligations. 

 'Mr Al Jenabi’s people smuggling activities showed a blatant disregard for Australian law,'  Senator Evans said. 

 'His conduct in repeatedly bringing boatloads of illegal immigrants into Australia, the  expectations of the Australian community that a person who commits crimes of this nature  not be rewarded with a visa, and the general deterrence factor in discouraging others from  engaging in similar conduct weigh heavily against Mr Al Jenabi.' 

 Senator Evans said he was seeking legal advice on how best to strengthen the provisions  for dealing with people smugglers in the Migration Act and the seriousness with which the  offences are considered for the purposes of the Refugees Convention. 

 Mr Al Jenabi was extradited from Thailand to Australia on 22 February 2003 to face  charges under the Migration Act of facilitating the bringing into Australia of a group of five  or more people, knowing they would become, upon entry to Australia, unlawful non-citizens.  

 He was convicted in September 2004 and sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment for the  first count and six years for the second charge with a non-parole period of four years,  backdated to June 2002.
