 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 Greens support those who defend human rights 

 25th Jan 05 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle attended a rally outside Downing  Centre Local Court in support of three people accused of helping  escaped refugees attain passports.    

 "The Greens have no qualms in supporting those who act in defence  of human rights," Senator Nettle said.    

 The activists facing court today are some of a group of 5 refugee  activists who had their homes raided by federal police late last year.  One of whom was not charged and another has already has his  charges dropped.    

 Of the three who faced court today one has had their case  dismissed whilst the two others await further consideration by the  judge as to whether there is enough evidence to proceed.    

 "It is the federal government who should be on trial today, for their  ongoing breaches of international law and shameless abuse of the  rights of those who come to Australia seeking asylum.    

 "The mandatory detention regime is a cruelty that motivates many  Australians to speak out and act against it. Those who do are people  of courage and compassion who should be thanked not hounded by  the government.    

 "History will judge this episode as another desperate attempt by the  Howard government to quash dissent.    

 "The Greens will continue to call for an end to the policy of  mandatory detention so that Australia can again be proud of its  welcoming attitude towards asylum seekers."
