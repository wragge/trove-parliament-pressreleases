 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 FIRST DECISIONS

 ON EAST TIMORESE PROTECTION VISA APPLICANTS

 Labor is concerned that Minister Ruddock appears to be prejudging appeals from the first group of East Timorese asylum-seekers to have their claims assessed.

 Labor believes that the East Timorese asylum-seekers are a very special case deserving of the utmost compassion. Most of these asylum-seekers have lived in Australia for over a decade and fled East Timor at a time when executions, torture and arbitrary arrest were common.

 There are around 1,700 claims from East Timorese asylum-seekers, with 168 in the first group.  Each of the 168 claims in the first group was rejected.

 The asylum-seekers involved are now entitled to appeal to the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT).  Should the RRT reject their claims, the asylum-seekers involved are able to approach the Minister on the basis that they have compelling humanitarian reasons to stay and the Minister, in an exercise of discretion, may grant a special humanitarian visa.

 I am disturbed to note that in his media release, Minister Ruddock appears to be prejudging both the outcome of the RRT appeals and precluding an exercise of Ministerial discretion in favour of these asylum-seekers.  In the final two paragraphs of his release, the Minister asserts that it is reasonable to expect these asylum-seekers to return home to East Timor and that it is now time to move on with their lives.

 Both the then-Labor Government and the current Coalition Government failed to respond with real compassion to their plight.  In particular, the hearing of their claims was substantially delayed.

 Today, East Timor has fundamentally changed and it is true to say that if these asylum-seekers returned to East Timor they would not be subject to persecution.  In that sense, as todayâ€™s decisions reflect, the asylum-seekers are no longer refugees under the Refugee Convention.

 However, these asylum-seekers do deserve our compassion.  They fled real persecution, the delay in the resolution of their claims was due to the actions of the Australian Government, they have lived for a very extended period of time in Australia, and many have no real ongoing connection with their former homeland.

 Labor therefore urges the Minister to resolve this long-running sore by creating a special visa class for these individuals.  There is no reason to fear the setting of a precedent that could be used by others, because the circumstances of these asylum-seekers are truly unique.

 Through their support for the deployment of Australian forces in East Timor, Australians showed their real concern for the East Timorese.  Many Australians understand the debt of gratitude we owe them from World War II.  Many other Australians believe that as a nation we waited too long to help them in their time of need.

 I urge the Minister to reflect the views of Australians, their compassion and kindness to the East Timorese by resolving this issue through a special visa class.
