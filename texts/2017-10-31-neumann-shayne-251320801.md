 SHAYNE NEUMANN MP 

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR    

 CLOSURE OF MANUS ISLAND REGIONAL PROCESSING CENTRE   

 Manus Island and Nauru were set up as regional transit processing facilities but have  become places of indefinite detention because of Malcolm Turnbull and Peter Dutton’s  failure to negotiate other third country resettlement options.   

 Peter Dutton’s failure to answer basic questions about arrangements in PNG after the  closure of the Regional Processing Centre has fuelled refugees' uncertainty about  moving to new accommodation.   

 The Turnbull Government has known about the closure of Manus Island RPC for more  than six months but has been unclear and unwilling to explain how refugees will  continue to have their basic human needs met - including access to security, health and  welfare services.   

 It is incumbent on Turnbull Government to do what they can to de-escalate tensions on  Manus Island and work with PNG authorities to ensure the safety of refugees, staff and  locals.                                                                                                                    

 Transferring refugees from one centre to another is not a long term solution; these  people urgently need viable third country resettlement options.    

 Peter Dutton must make clear what the Turnbull Government’s plans are for eligible  refugees who are not resettled as part of Australia’s agreement with the United States  and immediately secure other third country resettlement options.
