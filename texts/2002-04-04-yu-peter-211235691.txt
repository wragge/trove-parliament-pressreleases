 ABORIGINAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNANCE A KIMBERLY PERSPECTIVE

 Indigenous Governance Conference 3-5 April 2002 Canberra

 Peter Yu

 INTRODUCTION

 I acknowledge and respect that we meet here today on Ngunawal people’s land.

 I  congratulate  Reconciliation  Australia  for  convening  this  conference  on  Indigenous Governance  for  it  is  timely  that  Aboriginal  people,  government  and  industry  discuss  and debate this issue in Australia.

 In eight weeks time Australia will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the High Court’s Mabo decision.   That  decision  created  the  legal  foundation  for  recognising  the  special  place  of Aboriginal people in Australia’s social fabric.

 The  tragedy has  been  that  Australian  governments  have  not  been  able  to  respond  in  public policy terms to make that recognition a reality.

 Aboriginal victories in the courts have not translated to victories in the political process.  For the  most  part,  Aboriginal  people  have  not  been  able  enjoy  these  meager  won  rights,  even though they offered more in expectations by our communities.

 My  talk  today  concentrates  on  the  Kimberley  region’s  experience  since  native  title  was recognised.  And  while  I  will  rake  over  some  old  ground  -  for  my  essential  position  on Aboriginal self-determination has changed little over the past decade - I argue that there are opportunities now that the Aboriginal political movement must take advantage of so that the our people can get relief, enjoyment and benefit out of exercising these rights.

 But before I do that I want to briefly refer to Minister Ruddock’s speech at the ATSIC policy conference last week.  In attempt to stimulate debate on a new policy direction the Minister presented a five point agenda.

 FIRST,  HOW  DO  WE  SHIFT  THE  POLICY  EMPHASIS  TOWARDS  INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES?

 SECOND, REPLACE WELFARE DEPENDENCY WITH ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE.

 THIRD,  RECOGNISE  THAT  THERE  IS  A  PARTNERSHIP  OF  SHARED RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE.

 FOURTH, MAKE SUBSTANCE ABUSE A CENTRAL FOCUS OF OUR ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE ABORIGINAL HEALTH.

 HIS  FIFTH  AND  FINAL  PROPOSITION  CONCERNS  REFORM  OF  PROGRAM FUNDING SO THAT INDIGENOUS-SPECIFIC RESOURCES CAN BE TARGETED TO AREAS OF GREATEST NEED.

 You can see the problem we have. The implied assumption of the Minister’s agenda is that he views  ATSIC  and  the  Indigenous  leadership  as  defenders  of  the  status  quo.  He  wrongly thinks that the current chaotic arrangements where public funding is drip fed to the plethora of Aboriginal service delivery organisations is self-determination.

 There are two things clear to me that require immediate change for there to be any significant shift in the path in which we are currently heading.

 Firstly the nature of our leadership and the functional responsibility of our many institutions and  organizations  have  to  be  critically  assessed  and  reevaluated  in  terms  of  our  objectives within  the  framework  of  our  internal  corporate  and  cultural  governance  and  secondly Minister  Ruddock  and  the  Howard  Government  must  have  meaningful  dialogue  with  the Indigenous leadership to reevaluate their misconstrued ideological push for assimilation.

 While this Government dismisses a policy of investing in Aboriginal governance as a vehicle for  self-determination  it  is  they  who  are  the  defenders  of  the  status  quo  of  appalling Indigenous disadvantage.

 The  Harvard  Project  in  North  America  proves  with  irrefutable  empirical  data  what  many Aboriginal  Australian  people  have  intuitively  known.   That  the  deplorable  economic  and social circumstances in our communities will change for the better only when the Aboriginal communities can construct their own systems of governance and plan for their people’s long-term development.

 This country has two choices with respect to the relationship between Aboriginal people and the Australian State.  Indigenous public policy can be based on self-determination principles and  rely  on  good  governance  arrangements  or  it  can  be  continue  to  be  assimilationist  and suffer the consequences and burden that comes with dependency.

 The  challenge  for  Indigenous  people  in  this  country  is  to  articulate  our  position  and  assert through  self-determination  our  personal  and  collective  rights.   We  cannot  afford  to  be complacent and passive participants in the bureaucratic processes of governments whose sole agenda is assimilation.

 The Kimberley in the aftermath of Mabo

 The experience of the Kimberley over the past decade is instructive in this regard.

 When the High Court recognised native title in June 1992 many Kimberley Aboriginal people saw  it  as  a  legal  foundation  to  negotiate  a  new  relationship  with  the  State  and  Federal Government.

 Throughout 1992 and 1993 the Kimberley Land Council embarked on a consultation program of bush meetings throughout the region. We weren’t distracted by the legal complexities of whether  native  title  was  extinguished  by pastoral  leases,  which  covered  the  majority of  the Kimberley.  Such an outcome was unthinkable to Kimberley Aboriginal people who continue to practice their law and culture regardless of a land tenure system designed for white people in far away Perth.

 And on this we were vindicated by the Wik decision a few years later.

 There are over twenty distinct language groups in the Kimberley region; it is entirely likely that all will potentially be successful in their claim for recognition of their native title rights and interest to land and sea, as many continue to practice their laws and customs.

 But  native  title  common  law  rights  are  benign  and  symbolic  if  those  that  possess  it  do  not assert them.

 The  consequence  of  native  title  being  asserted  mean  that  governments  can  no  longer  treat Aboriginal people living  in the region’s six major towns and 200 incorporated communities as a population block with special economic and social needs.

 An  Aboriginal  right  to  negotiate  and  informed  consent  emerged  to  replace  the  discredited practice of consultation.

 The  issue  of  governance  for  a  sovereign  group  whose  members  are  bound  together  by  a system of law and custom as opposed to an incorporated Aboriginal body set up to manage funds and deliver services, is for the first time firmly on the agenda.

 This scenario was then and remains today a huge threat to governments and industry that will now have to negotiate their interests with Aboriginal people instead of imposing their agenda.

 It threatens also an army of government bureaucrats whose positions and authority depends on a relationship where Aboriginal people are mendicant recipients of largesse.

 As  well  it  threatens  many  Aboriginal  people  and  their  employees  who  gain  economic  and social benefit from a system that entrenches inequality and welfare dependency.

 In  the  aftermath  of  Mabo  Kimberley  Aboriginal  reformists  advocated  for  a  fundamental change to the political relationship between Kimberley Aboriginal people on a regional basis as a necessary pre-condition for the emergence of new Indigenous governance arrangements based on the recognition of native title.

 Despite  the  fact  that  the  Kimberley  region  incorporates  over  twenty  distinct  Aboriginal cultural  groups,  common  historical  experience  -   such  as  forced  removal  and institutionalization and the economic circumstances of the pastoral industry -  has created a region of social, economic and cultural connectedness.

 But  the glue that  holds  this  wider Aboriginal  Kimberley region  together is  respect  for each other’s traditional ownership, cultural responsibility and local autonomy.

 In the early 1990s the KLC and other Aboriginal organisations attempted to create a regional Aboriginal political and service delivery structure that could ensure an orderly development plan for the region.

 We  formed  a  Coalition  of  Kimberley  Aboriginal  Organisations  involving  the  land  council, the  Kimberley  Law  and  culture  Centre,  the  Kimberley  Language  Resource  Centre,  the region’s  seven  Aboriginal  resource  agencies,  The  Kimberley  Aboriginal  Medical  Services Council and the Aboriginal broadcasters.

 Our  arguments  for  a  regional  approach  to  the  development  of  a  sustainable  co-existence regime were compelling and backed up by comprehensive research.

 In  a  partnership  with  academics  from  ANU  the  Kimberley  organisations  commissioned  a study  into  the  Aboriginal  participation  in  the  Kimberley  regional  economy.   That  study showed  that  the  public  funding  of  the  region’s  Aboriginal  community  based  organisations and other funding targeted for Aboriginal benefit was the mainstay of the regional economy.

 Yet  the  study  showed  that  the  Kimberley  was  a  welfare  economy  with  public  money circulating in a chaotic manner via Aboriginal organisations and government agencies with no real linkages and little hope of changing the appalling impoverishment of the vast majority of Kimberley people.

 We  used  this  study -  widely recognised  as  the  most  comprehensive  regional  analysis  of  an Aboriginal economy undertaken in Australia - to argue for the need for an integrated regional approach to Aboriginal social and economic development.

 Central  to  our  proposal  was  the  need  for  a  Kimberley  Aboriginal  Authority  that  could integrate many of the Aboriginal organisations into a coherent regional approach under a new fiscal arrangement. The idea for a tripartite agreement involving the Aboriginal community and  the  State  and  Federal  Government  was  based  on  a  partnership  where  roles  and responsibilities could be clearly defined and outcomes measured against investment.

 We  proposed  the  negotiation  of  a  regional  framework  agreement,  which  could  enable  the orderly recognition of native title and the development of Aboriginal governance structures.

 We  also  recognised  that  there  was  a  huge  problem  in  the  capacity  of  Aboriginal  people emerging  from  a  colonised  relationship  to  take  on  the  responsibility  of  asserting  self-determination through self-governance structures.

 Aboriginal  people  as  an  urgent  priority  have  identified  a  comprehensive  education  and training strategy involving a partnership with the Aboriginal community and governments. In collaboration  with  the  Northern  Territory  University  we  commissioned  a  major  study  on Aboriginal training in the Kimberley, which was completed in 1994.

 The study found vast Commonwealth and State training funds floating around the Kimberley that were not responding to Aboriginal people’s needs and priorities.  It found that there were little  linkage  between  mainstream  training  and  education  providers  and  the  CDEP  workers that numbered of 6,000 through out the region.

 Building  the  capacity  of  Aboriginal  communities  through  linking  CDEP  with  a  regional training strategy was an important component of the regional approach that Kimberley people advocated several years ago.

 So much of what Kimberley Aboriginal reformists advocated 10 years ago as a consequence of the recognition of native title was ridiculed as heresy and a re-invention of apartheid by the State and Federal Government and by ATSIC.

 Many in ATSIC believed that we were deliberately dividing the Aboriginal community and attacking the authority of ATSIC.

 New Opportunities in Aboriginal Policy

 It  is  interesting  to  note  that  so  much  of  what  the  Kimberley  Coalition  of  Aboriginal Organisations advocated then is now part of mainstream policy thinking.

 The  recent  Commonwealth  Grants  Commission  Inquiry  into  Aboriginal  service  delivery recommended  that  new  fiscal  arrangements  should  be  negotiated  on  a  regional  basis involving a whole of government approach.

 The  COAG  National  Reconciliation  Framework  Agenda  emphasises  capacity  building, partnerships and re-engineering programs at the local level.

 The  Western  Australian  Government  is  committed  to  negotiating  comprehensive  regional agreements as the cornerstone of its Statement of Commitment Agreement it has signed with ATSIC.

 And  ATSIC  has  adopted  the  development  of  Regional  Authorities  as  formal  policy  and selected the Kimberley as a pilot project.

 2  major  issues  have  impeded  the  development  of  a  regional  approach  to  Indigenous  self-determination in the Kimberley.

 Firstly the opposition to native title by the Court State Government supported by the Howard Government meant that the resources and energy of the Aboriginal political movement was directed at defending people’s legal rights rather than asserting them and negotiating a new relationship with government.

 Secondly, ATSIC itself was at first clearly threatened by the assertion of native title rights in the  Kimberley.  Some  in  the  ATSIC  elected  arm  and  senior  officials  attempted  to  overtly resist the regional proposals advocated by the Kimberley Organisations.

 Eventually  the Kimberley ATSIC Regional Councils  took over responsibility to establish a Regional Authority in the Kimberley,  supported by the ATSIC Board.

 There is now an ideal opportunity to advance Aboriginal self-determination in the Kimberley.

 The Gallop  Government  in  Western  Australia is  committed  to  negotiating the settlement  of native  title  claims.  Since  it  came  to  power,  2  large  Kimberley  claims,  Tjurabalan  and Karrajarri, have been recognised by consent determination.

 My understanding is that the Bardi claim is also at an advanced stage of negotiation and there are now greater prospects for negotiating a Framework Agreement over Broome.

 I believe that once the High Court has resolved the question of whether a fence extinguishes native title on a pastoral lease pressure will mount on all parties to speed up the recognition of native title in the Kimberley.

 As  well  the  State  Government  is  committed  to  negotiating  comprehensive  regional agreements as formal policy and has identified Tjurabalan in partnership with the Tjurabalan native titleholders, ATSIC and the Kimberley Land Council as a pilot to advance a “new and just relationship” between the State of Western Australia and Aboriginal people.

 Tjurabalan

 With a combined population of approximately 1200 people and 26,000 square kilometers of land and waters of the Tanami Desert, the Tjurabalan region encompasses the communities of Ringers Soak, Billiluna, Mulan and Balgo.

 The broad process as I understand it is that Tjurabalan, assisted by the KLC, will undertake a scoping exercise to identify the issues in preparation for negotiations with government over a comprehensive agreement.  Issues will include;

 â¢ land title and land management, â¢ economic dividend from the use of Tjurabalan land such as mining, â¢ economic development, â¢ management of tourism, â¢ construction and management of housing and infrastructure, â¢ education and training, â¢ health services, and â¢ law and order issues.

 I have  known  many of  the  Tjurabalan  people  for  over  two  decades.   I had  the  privilege  of working  with  their  great  leaders  in  the  1980’s.  For  a  time  they  lived  as  refugees  in  Halls Creek having been evicted by a racists pastoralist, but it was their determination to return to their  traditional  country  and  establish  their  communities  on  their  terms  which  has  been  a source of inspiration to me ever since.

  I know that these people want to radically change their relationship with government and the wider  Australian  community.   They  are  not  interested  in  incremental  change  whereby ATSIC’s  CDEP  or  CHIP  program  can  be  rationalised  and  combined  with  State  services  to achieve a more effective delivery of service.

 This is a chance for government, ATSIC and supporting agencies such as the land council to re-write history. Not simply to add to the chaos of what already exists.

 I see Tjurabalan is similar terms to the nation building exercise in East Timor. There we have a new independent nation recognised as such by the whole world. And the world represented by the United Nations is committed to rebuilding East Timor so that it can enjoy its status as an independent state after a long history of colonisation and violent occupation.

 Tjurabalan is a nation of Aboriginal people who have responsibilities and obligations to each under a common system of law and culture and land ownership.

 Following the recognition that the Tjurabalan people own their country through native title, it is appropriate that governments should commit to a process of nation building.

 But this will only happen through the effective leadership of the Tjurabalan people.  A totally new governance structure will need to be built that goes way beyond what is legally required by the Native Title Act.

 The holding of land title, the distribution of economic benefit and the management of future acts, which are the core responsibilities of a Prescribed Body Corporate, will only be a part component of the potential governing responsibilities.

 Without  an  effective  Aboriginal  governance  structure  the  proposed  Tjurabalan Comprehensive  Agreement  may  result  in  more  efficient  welfare  service  but  the  essential dynamics of the current neo colonial relationship will remain entrenched.

 The  challenge  to  develop  Indigenous  governance  structures  is  daunting.  Within  the Tjurabalan  nation  there  are  four  sizable  communities  each  with  a  community  council  that manages ATSIC funds and other public funding.  The existing governance structures do not relate  to  the  cultural  integrity  of  the  community.  They  exist  for  the  requirements  of government accountability systems and the management of largesse. They are not Aboriginal structures.  Yet  they  are  what  Aboriginal  people  have  lived  with  over  the  past  twenty-five years or so and it is the corner stone of the ATSIC funding processes.

 Conclusion

 Governments  cannot  impose  the  new  Aboriginal  governance  arrangements.  It  must  come from  the  Aboriginal  community.  But  ATSIC  has  a  vital  role  to  play  in  enabling  the emergence of the new Aboriginal governance structures by re-directing resources to capacity building for Indigenous governance as an urgent priority.

 I feel confident that the people of Tjurabalan can build a governance structure and negotiate a new relationship with government. But I don’t believe that the State Government or ATSIC will be able to contain this new policy approach to selective pilot projects and manage it on their terms.

 Karajarri, Bardi, Walmajeri, Mirriwung/Gajjerrong and a range of other Aboriginal nations of the  Kimberley  will  assert  their  rights  and  demand  to  negotiate  own  relationship  with government.

 But governments and ATSIC will not be able to negotiate new arrangements from Perth and Canberra.  And that brings us back to the proposal for a regional Framework Agreement for the Kimberley as a whole to enable the orderly development of self-determination.
