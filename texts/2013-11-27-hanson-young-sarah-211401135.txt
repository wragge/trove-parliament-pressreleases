 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Wednesday, 27 November 2013    

 UN reports reveals slum like conditions  on Nauru and Manus Island    

 The UN’s damning report into the conditions in the Nauru and Manus Island detention  camp show why indefinite detention and the transfer of children and pregnant women to  Nauru must be stopped, the Australian Greens have said.    

 “The government’s secret war on refugees is going into overdrive, but the world is  watching on,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young  said.    

 “Dumping children, families and pregnant women into hot, cramped detention camps on  remote Pacific islands is unthinkably cruel and is hurting Australia’s international  reputation.    

 “In the future our children will look back at this point in time, shake their heads and  wonder how on Earth this was allowed to happen.    

 “The transfer of children, families and pregnant woman to Nauru must be stopped  immediately and time limits need to be placed on detention for all refugees.”    

 After failing to answer questions about the government’s refugee policies in Senate  Estimates hearings, the Greens will move to have the Immigration Department recalled  to face further interrogation.    

 “The detention network is shrouded in secrecy, just like the government’s Operation  Secret Boats, but the Australian people deserve to know about the cruelty that is being  carried out in their name,” Senator Hanson-Young concluded.
