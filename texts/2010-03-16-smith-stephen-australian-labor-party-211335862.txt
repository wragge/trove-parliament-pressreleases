 Engagement with Africa 

 Media release 

 16 March 2010 

 The Australian Government is committed to broadening and deepening engagement with Africa and the 

 African Union across the full spectrum of our relationship: trade and investment, peace and security, and 

 humanitarian and development assistance. 

 In January 2009 in Addis Ababa, I was the first Australian Foreign Minister to address a meeting of the 

 African Union Foreign Ministers' Executive Council. 

 Today I will meet HE Mr Erastus Mwencha, Deputy Chairman of the African Union Commission to continue 

 the dialogue I began last year with AU Chairman HE Mr Jean Ping. 

 The African Union is playing a vital role in advancing Africa's economic prosperity and peace and security 

 objectives.  

 In January this year, I also conducted the first visit to South Africa by an Australian Foreign Minister in more 

 than seven years. 

 Australia is determined to enhance high-level political engagement with South Africa, which is Australia's 

 most important economic partner in Africa.  

 Today I will meet South African Deputy Foreign Minister Susan van der Merwe.  

 We will discuss ways of boosting the bilateral relationship and exchange views on common interests, 

 including bilateral trade and investment and education links, as well as cooperation in the WTO, the G20 

 and the United Nations. 

 We will also discuss the situation in Zimbabwe and our continued trilateral cooperation in support of 

 recovery efforts in Zimbabwe. 

 Regrettably, a number of African countries continue to experience protracted and complex humanitarian 

 difficulties as a result of on-going armed conflict, political crises, people movement and drought. 

 Australia is committed to assisting African countries deal with these challenges.  

 Today I announce an $11 million package of humanitarian assistance to Somalia, the Democratic Republic 

 of the Congo (DRC) and Kenya. 

 This funding will support the provision of urgent food and humanitarian assistance, and protect vulnerable 

 and displaced people. 

 In Somalia, Australia will provide $3.5 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross to protect 

 civilians affected by conflict and $500,000 to the United Nations Department of Safety and Security. 

 In the DRC, Australia will provide $3.5 million through the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to 

 protect women and children in displaced persons camps.  

 Another $1.5 million through the World Food Programme will support maternal and child nutrition programs, 

 rehabilitation of rural infrastructure and capacity building for women farmers' groups in the DRC. 

 Australia will also provide $2.5 million will support the World Food Programme's operations in Kenya.  

 These include a relief operation providing food assistance to Somali and Sudanese refugees in Kenya, and 

 a livelihoods program for the arid and semi-arid areas of Kenya.
