 SENATOR THE HON. ERIC ABETZ  LIBERAL SENATOR FOR TASMANIA   

 

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Abetz welcomes news of no children in immigration detention centres   

 Liberal Senator for Tasmania, Eric Abetz, has welcomed reports that there are now no children in  detention following the success of the Liberal Government’s immigration policies.   

 “When we came to office, there were more than 2,000 children in detention - today that number is at  zero. This is an outstanding achievement and shows what can be done when you have an orderly  border protection policy,” Senator Abetz said today.   

 "This shows yet again that sound and fair policy translates into good social outcomes.”   

 "This should be an occasion for celebration and recognition that those who claimed some bizarre  moral rectitude in opposing the Liberal policy approach on Border Protection were actually the ones  responsible for seeing children in detention in the first  place."   

 Under the Liberal Government:  ï· 13 of 17 detention centres have been closed;  ï· It has been more than 600 days since the last boat arrived in Australia; and  ï· Now there are zero children in detention. 

 

 “This is in stark contrast to the record under the Labor/Green Immigration policies which saw more  than 800 boats carrying more than 50,000 illegal maritime arrivals and more than 1,200 people die at  sea.”   

 “Further, under Labor, border protection policies under Labor saw a budget blowout of $10 billion.  Under the Liberal Government we’ve been able to better invest that money in building the roads of  the 21st century, including the Midland Highway upgrade.”   

 “This is an excellent achievement which will be welcomed by many Tasmanians,” Senator Abetz  concluded.
