Cabinet has agreed, in principle, to amalgamate the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Veterans' Review Board,
the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal into a
single tribunal, the Administrative Review Tribunal.

 The
amalgamation would streamline administrative structures and enhance
operations.

 It is envisaged that separate divisions of the
proposed ART would develop and maintain flexible, cost-effective and
non-legalistic procedures relevant to their jurisdictions.

 An
interdepartmental committee comprising senior Commonwealth officers will
devise a strategy for implementing the amalgamation.

 The basis
and scope of administrative review, designed to reduce the number of
applications, the overall costs of merits review and excessive legalism,
will be examined.

 Detailed implementation of the
recommendations for improvements to process and procedures of merits review
tribunals contained in the Better Decisions Report of the Administrative
Review Council will also be considered.
