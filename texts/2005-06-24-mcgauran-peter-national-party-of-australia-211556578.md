 Media Release 

 Citizenship for 42 Refugees

 24 June 2005

 More than 40 refugees will celebrate World Refugee Day by becoming Australian citizens at a special ceremony held at  the Red Cross headquarters today.

 The Australian Government Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Peter McGauran, said the conferees were  refugees who have built new lives in Australia.

 ‘Our newest citizens have come from countries such as Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Ethiopia and former Yugoslavia. I am delighted  they are taking the final step in becoming full participants in the Australian community,’ Minister McGauran said.

 ‘The theme for World Refugee Day 2005 is ‘Courage’ and this citizenship ceremony is a celebration of the spirit, courage  and determination that characterises humanitarian entrants. 

 ‘Australia has one of the largest dedicated refugee and humanitarian resettlement programs in the world. In the past year  Queensland has welcomed 1180 arrivals under the Refugee and Special Humanitarian programs,’ Minister McGauran said.

 ‘Citizenship is the unifying force in our culturally diverse society. I encourage all those who are eligible to apply for  Australian citizenship.’

 Citizenship information is available at www.citizenship.gov.au or from the Citizenship Information Line on 131 880.

 The ceremony will take place today at the Red Cross Headquarters, 397 Adelaide Street, Brisbane. It will commence at 6pm.
