 ATTORNEY-GENERAL   THE HON. DARYL WILLIAMS AM QC MP 

 

 TRANSCRIPT 

 Doorstop 

 Tangney electorate office, WA 

 10.30am WST, 31 December 2002 

 Subject:  Detention centre fires, national security……………………………………e&oe   

 ATTORNEY: 

 Well thank you for coming out today. As you are aware, overnight there were further fires in  immigration detention centres, this time at Woomera. An extensive array of buildings was  destroyed. That is totally unacceptable. But what is utterly unacceptable is that the detainees  in the compound, who lit the fires, should actively seek to prevent the fire and emergency  service people from putting the fires out. That is just unacceptable and I think all Australians  are entitled to be very angry about that behaviour. Three-quarters of the detainees at  Woomera, Baxter and Port Hedland, have all been assessed as not refugees and have  exhausted their appeal processes. So they are all ready for deportation. The Government is  taking active measures to expedite the deportation of those people. There’s been a number of  other measures taken. There’s been a review of the fire safety procedures, there’s been  additional staff deployed, at Woomera and Baxter, South Australian police have been  assisting by supervising the perimeter, allowing the ACM staff to work within the centres.  There’s a range of other measures. The detainees at Baxter have been screened and their  belongings screened and there’s been a review of the policy in relation to cigarette lighters  and matches.  

 REPORTER: 

 Given the nature of the last 48 hours, does it look as if it is getting out of hand in terms of  detention staff, do you need to bring in extra staff? 

 ATTORNEY: 

 Extra staff have been brought in as appropriate. 

 REPORTER: 

 You said there was heightened security yesterday and yet this has happened again. 

 ATTORNEY: 

 This happened at Woomera. The previous fires were Port Hedland and Baxter and they were  under control. There was very extensive.. 

 REPORTER 

 (inaudible)..security at all the detention centres across the (inaudible) 

 ATTORNEY: 

 Yes, there were reviews of the security at the detention centres where there hadn’t been fires  but this still occurred at Woomera. We have a situation where detainees are engaging in  totally unacceptable behaviour. But what is extraordinary is that there are non-government 

  2

 organisations who are in effect accepting that this is appropriate behaviour. Now that is just  wrong. What it is doing is encouraging detainees to engage in this sort of action. It suggests to  detainees that the Government is likely to bow to violence and vandalism. The Government is 

 not going to bow to violence or vandalism. 

 REPORTER: 

 Does it also suggest a failure in management, to be able to keep this under control knowing  that its likely to happen? 

 ATTORNEY: 

 There is a range of measures that can be taken but you can not supervise every individual in a  detention centre on a 24-hour, seven day a week basis. They must at some time be able to be  free of supervision. What you can do and what is being done is to provide that they do not  have access to the sort of thing that will create damage, like matches and cigarette lighters.  

 REPORTER: 

 Channel 10 in Brisbane actually did a poll last night, asking the public whether they thought  the detainees should be deported. Ninety-nine per cent of those people said yes they should be  deported. That was 20,000 people that responded to that survey. What is your response to  that? 

 ATTORNEY: 

 Well I think its understandable that people react in that way by supporting deportation of  people who are deliberately damaging taxpayers’ property and deliberately putting lives and  safety of innocent people at risk. People going about their everyday job are having to fight 

 fires and then having to fight off the people who lit the fires. 

 REPORTER: 

 Is it true that some of these detainees are from countries who just won’t accept them back? 

 ATTORNEY: 

 There is a relatively small proportion of them where there are no existing arrangements for  deportation but in the main and as I said, three-quarters approximately of residents in each of  the three main centres have been cleared for deportation. They have exhausted all of their  avenues for appeal.  

 REPORTER: 

 But if they can’t actually be deported, what’s going to happen to them? Are they going to stay  in detention forever? 

 ATTORNEY: 

 Well that relatively small proportion will remain in detention until appropriate arrangements  can be made. What those arrangements are I’m not able to say at this time. 

 REPORTER: 

 (inaudible)..what can you say now about what has been put in place to prevent this happening  again? 

 ATTORNEY: 

 I’ve detailed a range of measures that have been put in place. There are additional staff at  each of the centres, the South Australian police are supervising the perimeters of Woomera  and Baxter so that the staff can be moved into the detention centres. There’s been a review of  the fire safety procedures at each place and there’s been a screening of the detainees and their  belongings.

 REPORTER: 

 Are the detainees going to be bussed out of Woomera? 

 ATTORNEY: 

 At the moment, all detainees are remaining in the centres at which they were prior to these  fires starting.  

 REPORTER: 

 Are you going to try and repair the damage at Woomera..(inaudible) 

 ATTORNEY: 

 That’s a decision yet to be taken. 

 REPORTER: 

 Given the damage that’s been done to each of these places, will the inmates actually get their  way and end up being sent close to the city ..(inaudible) 

 ATTORNEY: 

 Well at the moment there is accommodation available for all of those who are in the centres,  which has not been damaged. 

 REPORTER: 

 Will all the damage be repaired? 

 ATTORNEY: 

 Well in relation to Baxter I think the likelihood is that it will be. In relation to the other two  centres, I’m not able to say at this time. 

 REPORTER: 

 (inaudible)…Perth detention centre last night. Are we talking about copycats? 

 ATTORNEY: 

 I think that they are entirely unrelated. The events there seem to be related to the  arrangements within the centre. 

 REPORTER: 

 In relation to those people from Vietnam, what is the situation with repatriation to Vietnam. 

 ATTORNEY: 

 Well I can’t comment on the individual circumstances of the detainees. I’m not aware of  whether they have sought a visa or they are just being detained for deportation. Nor can I  comment on whether any arrangements have been made with the Vietnamese Government in  relation to those people.  

 REPORTER: 

 Just on another issue, what is being done to increase the security of national buildings,  including embassies? 

 ATTORNEY: 

 Well since September 11 we have been on a heightened security alert and that has resulted in  there being additional security measures in relation to buildings like embassies and  consulates, which are seen as being of greater risk than the others. In relation to Government  buildings in Canberra, there has been a Government-wide review of security measures and  additional steps have been taken by the individual departments to ensure the safety of the  buildings.

 REPORTER: 

 How many buildings do you consider to be your highest priority and how many will be put in  the back cupboard? 

 ATTORNEY: 

 Well I can’t comment on that. The buildings seen to be at the highest risk are generally those  related to the United States, to Israel and Jewish interests. 

 REPORTER: 

 If we have Australians working in and around any of those buildings, that..(inaudible)..a  sitting duck? 

 ATTORNEY: 

 I don’t consider any building a sitting duck. Appropriate security measures are taken in  respect of the relevant buildings on the basis of the assessed security risk. 

 REPORTER: 

 Well should any Australians working in those buildings or around them be concerned for their  safety? 

 ATTORNEY: 

 I think anybody working in those sorts of buildings should be alert but not alarmed. They  should act like any other Australian citizen in carrying on their daily work. We have an  increased threat of terrorism, something we haven’t had to live with prior to the last 18 

 months. Now in those circumstances, we need to be a little more alert than we have been. But  we should go about our daily lives, doing the things that we would do in the way that we  would do them. 

 REPORTER: 

 What kind of changes will be necessary to bring the standard of security up to the relevant  standard in the current climate of terrorism? 

 ATTORNEY: 

 To bring buildings up to the relevant standard of security, you must assess the risk and take  appropriate steps and that has been done. 

 REPORTER: 

 Can I just ask one last question in relation on Baxter, if you’re definitely going to repair this  (inaudible) over the others. Does that mean that, with the events of the last couple of days,  that the process is going to get speeded up, to move all the detainees from Baxter and speed  up the process of the management (inaudible)? 

 ATTORNEY: 

 That’s something that has yet to be decided. That hasn’t, so far as I am aware, been  determined, that Baxter will be repaired. But I suggested yesterday and I suggest today that  it’s highly likely given that it’s a new facility. Now, one thing that I think needs to be clear is  that it’s not the processing time that’s caused this behaviour on the part of the detainees. The  processing time is not relevant. What is relevant here is that people have been denied access  to Australia and they are seeking to put pressure on the Government to allow them to stay.  The Government will not be bowing to that pressure.
