 Kevin Andrews MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 

 

 Illegal arrivals transferred to Nauru, citizenship tests 

 Thursday, 15 March 2007 

 Doorstop: CPO, Brisbane 

 E&OE… 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Ladies and Gentlemen, the Australian Government has decided to transfer to  Nauru the illegal arrivals which were picked up by the HMAS Success in the  Indian Ocean.  The Government is committed to a strong border protection  policy, and we are also committed to sending the strongest possible message  of deterrence to people who would engage in the dangerous and unlawful  activity of people smuggling.  These people will be transferred to Nauru and  any claims that they have will be processed in the normal course there.   

 Can I say something about another matter, mainly citizenship; the Australian  Government is unapologetic about wanting people who wish to become  citizens of Australia to have knowledge of the culture, the values and  traditions of the Australian community.  Citizenship of Australia is a privilege  and we believe that people coming to Australia will better be able to integrate  into the broader Australian community if they understand and have a general  appreciation of culture and the values of the Australian people. 

 QUESTION: 

 Regarding the 83 asylum seekers, what will happen to the one in Perth at the  moment? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 The one who’s being treated in Perth will continue to be treated in Perth.  And  depending on the outcome of that treatment a decision will be made. 

 QUESTION: 

 Do you genuinely think that it will act as a deterrent or is this just a message  to the Australian population?  Is it permeating, that message, beyond  Australia? (Inaudible) 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Well these people smugglers presumably (inaudible) the passage which has  been reputed as being between $US5000-10,000 per head, or over $500,000  on the basis that they will get to Australia this group of people.  And our  message of deterrence to them and anybody else who might be considering  this is that we will process them in a way in which doesn’t involve entering into  mainland Australia.  We want to send the strongest possible message that we  possibly can. 

 QUESTION: 

 (Inaudible) of those people that are on Nauru, they’re getting health checks,  they’re getting looked after and seen playing cricket, do you think it really is  much of deterrence? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Well as I said, not coming to Australia is a great a deterrent than being landed  in Australia and then processed in Australia.  And that’s why we have this  option available to us.  We’re thankful to the government of Nauru for their  continued cooperation under out memorandum of understanding.  They will be  processed on Nauru and that sends a stronger message of deterrence than  allowing these people to come to mainland Australia. 

 QUESTION: 

 Do you have any intelligence to suggest that more boats are currently on the  way or alternatively that people are preparing to leave and head in this  direction? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 I can’t go into operational matters obviously that go to issues of security.  Let  me say this, Australia has continued to be vigilant in the terms of maintaining  a very strong border protection.  This is part and parcel of that, we’ve  remained committed to strong border protection and we’ll take whatever  measures we can to ensure that Australian borders are protected. 

 QUESTION: 

 (Inaudible) 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Well as I understand, the Prime Minister wasn’t aware this person was  attending a function (inaudible), I’m sure the Prime Minister would’ve had a  different outcome had he known prior to that. 

 [Ends]
