 The $6.6 million Migrant Community Employment Fund, secured by Mr Bandt through discussion  with the government, will assist employment agencies and community organisations respond to the  underemployment of new migrants and refugees.   

 “We’ve got taxi drivers with Masters degrees. We’ve got local University graduates who can’t even  get a job interview because their name is Mohamed or they wear a hijab. Something needs to  change and this is a good start” Mr Bandt said   

 “This very important jobs initiative that will make a big impact on employment of people from  refugee backgrounds across the country, including in my electorate of Melbourne.”   

 “I commend the work of the many African-Australians and members of the Melbourne Employment  Forum who have fought hard for this fund and thank Minister Shorten for tackling this important  issue.”
