 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH   

 4 September 2011   

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR,  JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH MR SCOTT MORRISON MHR,   SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP,  SYDNEY   

 E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 The first to point to make is that as of this morning the Government has no border protection policy  whatsoever. The Government’s policy to stop the boats was Malaysia and PNG and according to the  Government, the Solicitor-General’s opinion means that both Malaysia and PNG are now ruled out. The  second point to make is that I think the Government is seeking to use the Solicitor-General’s opinion as an  excuse to drop offshore processing altogether and this of course is a huge cave-in to the Greens and to the  left of the Labor Party.   

 I want to make the point - this is very important - that in the judgement of the Coalition the Solicitor-General’s opinion does no such thing. The Solicitor-General’s opinion does not rule out Nauru at all and I  make three points about Nauru. First of all, Nauru happened under the existing legislation. Nauru was  operating for many years under the existing legislation. The second point I make is that since then Nauru has  signed the UN Convention on Refugees and it’s made it very clear that it’s quite happy to adjust its domestic  law if necessary to fit in with the High Court’s decision. The third point I want to make and again, this is  very important about Nauru, is that Nauru’s legal system is essentially the same as Australia’s. Two senior  Australian judges sit on the Supreme Court of Nauru and the Court of Appeal for Nauru is in fact the High  Court of Australia. So any suggestion that there is some problem with the Nauruan legal system and the way  Nauruans are treated or people are treated in Nauru I think is just utterly implausible given the way the  Nauruan legal system works.   

 The next point I want to make is that if the Government wants to put offshore processing beyond legal doubt  by amending the Migration Act the Coalition is prepared to work constructively with the Government to  bring that about. We don’t want the Government to use the High Court’s decision, the Solicitor-General’s  opinion as an excuse to drop offshore processing because offshore processing is an essential part of any  effective plan to stop the boats.   

 The final point I make is that the Coalition’s policy is what it has always been. We will stop the boats and  we will stop the boats because we’ll do three things: first of all we’ll have effective offshore processing,  second we’ll have temporary protection visas and third, we will retain the option to turn boats around where  it is safe to do so.   

 Scott, over to you.

 SCOTT MORRISON:   

 Thanks Tony and just to reaffirm the points that the Leader has made; the only thing standing between  moving forward on border protection and for third country offshore processing, it’s not the Opposition, it’s  not the Nauruan Government, it’s not even the High Court, it is in fact Julia Gillard and her own test of  conviction when it comes to the issue of offshore processing. This is a government that has flipped and  flopped on this issue continually and I think they’ve showed no conviction or no consistency in how they  approach these matters and I think that’s one of the key reasons they’ve got themselves into so many  difficulties. So this is a test of the Prime Minister and the Labor Party’s conviction and commitment to  proper border protection measures that are proven and the Coalition, as the Leader has just said, would be  working with the Government if they choose to do so, in moving forward to ensure that we have an  appropriate border protection regime and immigration arrangements that address that need.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Ok. Do we have any questions?   

 QUESTION:   

 [Inaudible] have you actually seen that advice from the Solicitor-General [inaudible]?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, the Shadow Attorney-General George Brandis SC has seen the advice, he has carefully analysed it. He  has put out a statement and he has been interviewed about it and I reiterate, we don’t believe that there is  anything in the Solicitor-General’s advice that rules out Nauru, nothing that rules out Nauru.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, will you support changes to the Migration Act brought by the Government even if they don’t  reintroduce TPVs or are TPVs a necessary precondition?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Yeah look, that’s a good question. TPVs are necessary to stop the boats but we don’t want to obstruct the  Government in any way in making it absolutely crystal clear that third country offshore processing can  continue. So if the Government is serious about PNG, let alone Nauru, if the Government wants to continue  with its own policy in respect of PNG and they think there is a problem with the Act we will work  constructively with them to correct the Act.    

 Now, as I said, if they want to stop the boats we don’t just need third country offshore processing, we also  need TPVs and the option to turn the boats around. But, if the Government wants to continue with offshore  processing in PNG or in Nauru we will work them to amend the Act.   

 QUESTION:   

 Irrespective?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Yep, we’re not saying they’ve got to introduce TPVs but we certainly would if we were the Government.  We’re not saying they’ve got to because this is a good faith offer to the Prime Minister; if you want to

 resurrect something out of this mess, if you want to have what you think is a credible border protection  policy, we’ll work with you to bring it about.   

 QUESTION:   

 [Inaudible]   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well look, this is a test for the Prime Minister obviously but if she wants to continue with PNG, if not  Malaysia, well, this is a chance for her to do so.   

 QUESTION:   

 How would your [inaudible] policy for Nauru work [inaudible] unaccompanied minors [inaudible]?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well I don’t think that necessarily does. The fact that it’s reviewable doesn’t mean that it would be  problematic and I make two points, I reiterate the points I made earlier. First, Nauru happened under the  existing legislation. There was no challenge to Nauru under the existing legislation when Nauru was  previously operating. Second, and this is perhaps more germane; the Nauruan legal system is essentially the  same as Australia’s. Nauru’s legal protections are essentially the same as Australia’s. So, even if the  legislation wasn’t changed I am confident that we would be able to send people to Nauru for processing; but  the point I’m making today is that if the Government doesn’t think that we can continue third country  offshore processing in the light of the Solicitor-General’s opinion, we stand ready to help them. We stand  ready to allow them to return to PNG. If that’s what they still want to do, we’ll help them do it.   

 QUESTION:   

 How long is that offer going to be [inaudible]?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well look, I’m not demanding that the Prime Minister rush into accepting it today or tomorrow. What I’m  saying is that the Government doesn’t have a border protection policy as things stand. As things stand,  according to the Government, Malaysia and PNG have been taken off the table. If they want to put PNG  back onto the table, if they want to explore Nauru, we will allow them to do so because we will allow them  to make the legislative changes that they might think are necessary to put beyond any doubt the ability of the  Government to send people to PNG or Nauru.   

 SCOTT MORRISON:   

 Can I just make one point. The Prime Minister has some important opportunities ahead of her in the next  week or so. She has the opportunity to pick up the phone to the Leader of the Opposition, she has the  opportunity this week in Auckland to walk across the room and talk to the President of Nauru, who will be  there and will of course be in Australia in Perth in October for CHOGM. There is no shortage of  opportunity, should she resolve to go forward with offshore processing, take up these opportunities and  show her Government’s commitment to border protection. But that test is very much now before her.   

 QUESTION:   

 [Inaudible] just on another issue, [inaudible], the Gaddafi regime [inaudible]. When you were in government  under John Howard [inaudible]?

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I’m afraid I just have no knowledge of that.   

 QUESTION:   

 Do you know if the Government was part of the CIA [inaudible]?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I just have no knowledge.    

 QUESTION:   

 On the [inaudible] itself, the legislation [inaudible], when you take office you will have to rewrite aspects of  the Migration Act [inaudible]?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I suggest that you might want to look at George Brandis’ statement. Nauru is doable under this High  Court decision. I don’t believe that there’s anything in the Solicitor-General’s opinion today which shows  that Nauru is not doable. But the point I’m making today is that if the Government wants to resurrect its own  policy, its own policy included PNG as well as Malaysia. If they want to press ahead with PNG and if they  think that requires amendments to the Migration Act, we will work with them to bring that about. You see,  we want to secure our borders. We don’t want to get in the way of a government which is fair dinkum about  securing our borders and this is a test for the Prime Minister. If she is fair dinkum about her own policy she  will work with us to make what amendments she thinks are necessary to the Migration Act to allow her at  least to go ahead with PNG.   

 Thank you.
