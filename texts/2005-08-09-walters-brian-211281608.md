 Suing Into Submission: Using Litigation to Quell Dissent 

 

 Free speech is about giving a voice to the community. 

 

 Blue Wedgie 

 Last  week  the  Blue  Wedges  coalition  approached  the  Supreme  Court  to  

 challenge  the  legality  of  the  government’s  “trial”  dredging  of  Port  Phillip  

 Bay. Blue Wedges allege that the dredging is in breach of the government’s 

 own  laws,  particularly  because  it  is  being  conducted  without  any  

 environment  effects  statement.  Section  6(2)  of  the  Environment  Effects  Act 

 requires  that  “no  works”  be  carried  until  the  EES  has  been  considered  by  

 the Minister. The claim by Blue Wedges had, at the very least, real prospects 

 of success. 

 

 A challenge like this takes months to be given a full hearing by the Supreme 

 Court. By then the dredging could be finished, and there would be no point 

 in the Court ruling on the controversy. 

 

 For  this  reason,  the  Blue  Wedges  coalition  asked  the  court  for  an  

 interlocutory  injunction  to  prevent  works  until  the  issue  could  be  fully  

 argued. 

 

 In  such  cases  it  is  usual  for  the  party  who  seeks  an  injunction  to  give  the  

 court an undertaking to pay any damages caused by the delay in works if the 

 court ultimately rules against the legal challenge. If you want a court to stop 

  2

 

 something so you can bring a case, you must be prepared to cover the loss 

 caused if you fail. 

 

 In this case, the prospective damages from a delay in the dredging was said 

 to be some $32 million, accumulating at over $300,000 a day. There was no 

 prospect of a community group honestly giving an undertaking to pay such 

 a vast sum, and they sought to be excused from the requirement. 

 

 Justice  Mandie  would  not  excuse  them  from  this  requirement,  and  

 accordingly would not grant the injunction. 

 

 Whatever  you  think  of  the  merits  of  dredging  Port  Phillip  Bay,  the  Blue  

 Wedges  case  highlights  an  important  gap  in  our  rule  of  law.  If  the  

 government is acting unlawfully in this trial dredging, surely the rule of law 

 requires that it be held to account. But how? 

 

 The common law assumes that private individuals only take court action to 

 protect their private interests. The common law also assumes that the only 

 party  who  approaches  the  courts  to  uphold  the  public  interest  is  the  

 Attorney-General. Both these assumptions are now outdated and wrong. 

 

 The  common  law  model  does  not  take  account  of  community  groups  

 approaching  the  courts  not  for  any  financial  interest,  but  for  the  public  

 good. It is not unusual for community groups to be in stark conflict with the 

 Attorney-General of the day in doing so. When Liberty Victoria approached 

 the  Federal  Court  seeking  relief  for  the  asylum  seekers  on  the  Tampa they 

 did so in spite of strong efforts by the government of the day, including the 

 Attorney-General,  to  oppose  them.  But  if  Liberty  Victoria,  (and  other  

 concerned  members  of  the  public)  had  not  approached  the  court,  there  

  3

 

 would have been no one to speak for the asylum seekers whose rights were 

 being overridden. 

 

 And  yet,  when  the  courts  consider  cases  brought  by  such  community  

 groups, they generally apply rules designed for a different situation - namely 

 for those who come to court to defend their private interests. 

 

 The  safeguard  of  relying  on  the  Attorney-General  to  protect  the  public  

 interest  is  no  longer  enough.  It  is  true  that  the  Attorney-General  may  

 intervene  in  any  case  as  of  right,  and  may  give  his  “fiat”  for  an  issue  of  

 public interest to be litigated by another person. But what if the Attorney-General is himself party to the conduct in question? 

 

 In the Blue Wedges case, the Victorian Attorney-General has an interest. He 

 is  also  the  Minister  for  Planning,  who  administers  the  environment  effects  

 process.  He  has  made  public  pronouncements  in  support  of  the  trial  

 dredging.  He  is  not  to  be  regarded  as  a  genuinely  independent  law  officer  

 who would defend the public interest in this matter despite his own political 

 interests. 

 

 Whether in Victoria or elsewhere, this is the reality with Attorneys-General 

 in Australia today. They are no longer independent of the political fray, and 

 our  reliance  on  the  Attorney-General  to  uphold  issues  of  public  interest  is  

 unrealistic and ignores the political pressures to which they are subject.  

 

 In 1972, when the Attorney-General of Tasmania, Mervyn Everett, gave his 

 fiat to conservationists to challenge the lawfulness of the flooding of Lake 

 Pedder,  he  refused  to  accept  a  cabinet  directive  to  stop  the  litigation.  The  

  4

 

 Premier,  Eric  Reece,  sacked  him  and  assumed  the  office  of  Attorney-General himself. The courts were not permitted to decide. 

 

 Mt Etna Bat Caves 

 A  similar  case  to  the  Blue  Wedges  experience  occurred  in  the  litigation  

 surrounding  the  Mt  Etna  caves  in  Queensland.  These  caves,  apart  from  

 being very beautiful, contained breeding habitat for the ghost bat, which is 

 unique  to  Australasia  and  listed  as  vulnerable.  It  is  Australia’s  only  

 carnivorous bat and the second largest such bat in the world. It has the most 

 sensitive hearing of any land mammal, and has been the subject of specialist 

 hearing research. 

 

 One cave, Speaking Tube, was considered critical to the habitat of the ghost 

 bats in the area. 

 

 Central Queensland Cement was mining limestone at Mt Etna, which was in 

 a public reserve. Legal advice had been obtained that the mining was illegal. 

 

 When  the  Company  announced  that  it  would  blast  Speaking  Tube,  the  

 Central  Queensland  Speleological  Association  sought  injunctions  in  the  

 Queensland Supreme Court. 

 

 The  court  found  that  the  speleologists  lacked  standing,  and  did  not  grant  

 injunctions pending the full hearing. More importantly, it ordered that they 

 deposit $15,000 for security for costs in respect of the balance of the action 

 - that is, they had to put up money for Queensland Cement’s costs. 

 

 After a series of further hearings dealing with procedural issues, Justice De 

 Jersey  ordered  the  speleologists  to  give  further  security  in  the  sum  of  

  5

 

 $45,000 within a fortnight, failing which, the case would be struck out - and 

 the company would blast Speaking Tube. 

 

 The speleologists embarked on a fundraising campaign. They raised $20,000, 

 and had the balance guaranteed by a Brisbane woman. 

 

 However,  it  then  became  clear  that  if  they  deposited  the  $45,000,  the  

 speleologists would be met with a further application for yet more security 

 for  costs.  They  knew  they  would  not  be  able  to  raise  this,  and  then  they  

 would lose the $45,000. 

 

 The speleologists abandoned their action. 

 

 The  manager  of  Central  Queensland  Cement  had  admitted  that  the  

 limestone  around  Speaking  Tube  would  not  be  needed  for  ten  years.  

 Nevertheless, the following morning, 12 June 1989, a screen of trucks was 

 placed  in  front  of  the  cave  in  a  vain  bid  to  block  the  view  of  waiting  

 television  cameras.  The  company  then  dynamited  Speaking  Tube  out  of  

 existence. 

 

 Despite  several  court  hearings,  the  cave  was  destroyed  without  the  legality  

 of the mining ever being determined. 

 

 Access to justice is critical for the rule of law. There is no point having the 

 law  if  members  of  the  community  are  not  able  to  approach  the  courts  to  

 obtain  remedies  to  enforce  it.  It  is  an  affront  to  the  rule  of  law  to  leave  

 anyone - especially the government - free to break the law because no one 

 can afford to challenge them. 

 

  6

 

 Where issues of public interest are raised, particularly by non-profit groups 

 acting for what they perceive to be the public good, it is no longer enough 

 to  assume  that  such  matters  are  only  for  an  Attorney-General  to  pursue.  

 Rather,  courts  should  be  assiduous  to  ensure  that  the  merits  of  claims  of  

 unlawfulness by government authorities are determined as soon as possible.  

 

 It  is  time  for  a  comprehensive  approach  to  giving  community  groups  a  

 hearing in the courts. New procedures are needed. Where non-profit groups 

 approach  the  courts  in  order  to  uphold  the  public  good,  in  a  proceeding  

 with real prospects of success, generally they should not have to pay costs, 

 they should not have to give security for costs, and they should not have to 

 give undertakings as to damages. 

 

 Upholding the rule of law requires us to give the community a hearing. 

 

 Muzzling FIDO 

 John  Sinclair  was  named  Australian  of  the  Year  in  1976.  He  grew  up  in  

 Maryborough  in  Queensland.  He  had  studied  agriculture  and  had  been  a  

 district organiser for the Young Farmers. Having qualified at night school, 

 he worked as a teacher with the Queensland Education Department. 

 

 Sinclair had heard about Fraser Island from his parents, who honeymooned 

 there,  and  when  he  visited  the  place,  it  fulfilled  his  almost  mythical  

 expectations.  

 

 John  became  the  driving  force  behind  the  Fraser  Island  Defence  

 Organisation.  Without  FIDO,  Fraser  Island  would  have  been  logged  and  

 mined  to  the  point  where  it  lost  most  of  its  natural  values.  FIDO  is  

  7

 

 responsible for its status as a national park. The story of the Fraser Island  

 campaign is one of tenacity and ingenuity - and injustice.  

 

 During the course of the campaign, in which not only the mining industry 

 but  also  the  Bjelke-Petersen  government  attacked  him  relentlessly,  John  

 Sinclair’s wife received threatening phone calls. His children had the tyres on 

 their bikes slashed. He himself was booed when he led his scout troop into 

 the arena at the Maryborough Show. 

 

 In  the  Queensland  Parliament  Sinclair  was  repeatedly  vilified  by  National  

 Party MPs with false and scandalous allegations -for which he was given no 

 right of reply.  

 

 The  Education  Department  moved  him  without  warning  from  

 Maryborough to a specially created post in Brisbane, and then, again with no 

 warning, to Ipswich.  

 

 At  the  height  of  the  controversy,  Sinclair  published  in  his  newsletter  the  

 submission  he  had  made  to  the  Commonwealth’s  Commission  of  Inquiry  

 into  Fraser  Island  mining.  In  it,  he  attacked  the  mining  company  

 Murphyores  for  “corruptly  obtaining  its  leases  and  licences”.  The  

 Murphyores company.sued him for defamation.  

 

 Murphyores  had  tried  to  stop  the  Commonwealth’s  inquiry  -  taking  two  

 proceedings.  The  failure  of  its  challenge  to  the  constitutionality  of  the  

  8

 

 

 Commonwealth’s inquiry was one of the first great environmental victories 

 in the Australian courts - the High Court’s decision in Murphyores1. 

 

 But now Murphyores sued John Sinclair personally, and others with him. He 

 was  under  immense  pressure  to  do  something  to  relieve  the  burden  from  

 others  -  particularly  the  Hervey  Bay  Publishing  Company,  the  small  

 business which printed FIDO’s newsletter. Eventually, three days before the 

 hearing,  he  caved  in,  apologised,  and  paid  out  a  significant  but  indisclosed  

 sum to Murphyores. 

 

 Then  the  Education  Department  sent  him  on  another  sequence  of  

 unsolicited  transfers  and  he  resigned,  abandoning  $250,000  in  

 superannuation. His family life in tatters, and having filed for bankruptcy, he 

 moved to Sydney, where he was unemployed for six months, a refugee from 

 a State whose heritage at Fraser Island and Cooloola he had done so much 

 to protect. 

 

 Today  Fraser  Island  is  world  heritage  listed  and  a  mecca  for  people  all  

 around the world - a wonderful resource for refreshment and inspiration. It 

 would have been lost to Queensland and to the world if not for FIDO. And 

 yet the legal system did not protect those who spoke out to make the world 

 a  better  place,  and  the  cost  to  John  Sinclair  -  the  Australian  of  the  year  -  

 diminished all of Australia. 

 

 “Barwon Water - Frankly Foul”

 at Maryborough (1975) 132 CLR 473

 The  Bannockburn  Yellow  Gum  Action  Group  (“BYGAG”)  was  a  small  

 community group formed in 1997 to protect a local grassy woodland. The 

 woodland contained some magnificent specimens of Yellow Gum. The site 

 was assessed by Barwon Water’s consultants as being of State conservation 

 significance and was entitled to protection under four separate listings of the 

 Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act.  

 

 Barwon  Water,  a  public  authority  responsible  for  the  water  supply  and  

 sewerage of the greater Geelong region, under its then chairman, Frank De 

 Stefano, wanted to bulldoze the woodland for a sewerage farm.  

 

 Frank  De  Stefano  was  a  prominent  member  of  the  Geelong  community.   

 He  had  been  a  councillor  for  several  years  and  had  been  elected  the  last  

 mayor  before  council  amalgamations.  He  was  awarded  the  Order  of  

 Australia in 1988. Mr De Stefano ran an accountancy business with ten staff. 

 Initially  BYGAG  attempted  to  communicate  their  concerns  directly  to  

 Barwon  Water.  However  it  soon  became  clear  that  there  would  be  no  

 negotiation  on  the  Yellow  Gums.  Other  conventional  avenues  of  

 negotiation were cut off and they found it difficult to get space in the press.  

 BYGAG met to develop a strategy. Communicating to the community was 

 essential and making a bumper sticker was one small aspect of the strategies 

 chosen.  

 

 One man, experienced in the campaign to prevent the use of Albert Park for 

 a Grand Prix race track, offered to develop a slogan for a sticker. He came 

 up with ‘Barwon Water, Frankly Foul’ which alluded to Barwon Water’s bad 

 record  with  its  ocean  sewerage  outfall,  and  also  made  reference  to  its  

 Chairman. 

 

  10

 

 Frank  De  Stefano  could  have  laughed  it  off.  Or  he  could  have  created  his  

 own  bumper  sticker.  Or  he  could  have  used  his  influence  in  the  media  to  

 reply to his critics.  

 

 Instead he sued for defamation. 

 

 The seven defendants initially named in the writ were nominated based on a 

 copy  of  notes  taken  at  a  meeting  which  they  were  attending.  The  meeting  

 had no relation whatsoever to the Bannockburn Yellow Gum issue. It had 

 been called to organise an environmental festival. However the over zealous 

 note taker had recorded a conversational aside when someone remarked that 

 stickers had been produced. for the Bannockburn protest and identified the 

 slogans, including ‘Barwon Water, Frankly Foul’.  

 

 Desperate to put a stop to escalating protests that threatened to hold up the 

 development  of  the  sewerage  ponds,  Barwon  Water  retaliated,  on  Mr  De  

 Stefano’s behalf, by delivering writs on Christmas Eve. 

 

 Although  the  writs  named  Mr  De  Stefano  as  the  Plaintiff,  the  case  was  

 funded, at public expense, by Barwon Water. 

 

 In defamation cases, it is necessary to set out (“plead”) the imputations that 

 you allege arise from the statement you complain about. 

 

 Mr. De Stefano pleaded that the joke carried the imputations that: 

 â¢ Frank De Stefano was a foul person. 

 â¢ Frank  De  Stefano  was  a  person  smeared  with  the  sewage  that  the  

 authority of which he was Chairman treated. 

 â¢ Frank De Stefano was a person who smelt like sewage. 

  11

 

 â¢ Frank  De  Stefano  was  a  person  unfit  to  hold  the  position  of  

 Chairman of Barwon Water. 

 

 The Defendants were confronted by a dilemma. They could defend the case, 

 at great expense, and run the risk of losing their houses if they lost, and lose 

 a great deal of money even if they won. They were confronted by a person 

 who  was  using  public  money  to  run  his  case,  and  faced  none  of  the  same  

 risks. The defendants were not familiar with defamation legislation, fatigued 

 from running a demanding campaign and trying to keep up professional and 

 personal commitments. 

 

 Defending the case was likely to take a large investment of time, week after 

 week, for years. 

 

 The case became enmeshed in complexity and cost. Two of the defendants 

 opted for independent legal advice which further complicated taking a joint 

 approach to defending it. The remaining five stuck it out to the end with a 

 combination of pro bono (ie offered free of charge) legal advice and paid legal 

 advice. This was a lonely phase of the process as the writ had the effect of 

 intimidating the community and people were reluctant to be identified with 

 the action. 

 

 The group took their advice, apologised and paid $10,000. 

 

 The  case  was  an  enormous  setback  to  the  community  campaign  -  few  

 wanted to risk involvement if they were likely to be sued. 

 

  12

 

 Nevertheless  the  protest  continued.  A  committed  group  left  their  homes  

 and took up residence on site hoping to forestall the chainsaws. Impromptu 

 blockades of protestors’ cars held up the heavy machinery.  

 

 The  trees  were  numbered  and  photographed  so  that  Barwon  Water’s  false  

 figures could be reliably disputed. Brave individuals locked on to machines 

 or  trees.  Some  endeavoured  to  get  their  message  across  with  theatre  and  

 mime. A lone horseman broke police lines carrying a huge red flag bearing 

 the message ‘STOP’. 

 

 But  wider  numbers  and  the  consequent  political  pressure  that  this  would  

 involve were not marshalled. 

 

 In the end, Barwon Water felled the trees, witnessed by grieving members of 

 the community. 

 

 After  the  trees  were  felled  protestors  on  site  were  outnumbered  by  about  

 three to one by police and hired security guards.  

 

 Those members of the community had been silenced by the defamation writ 

 brought against them. 

 

 We are free to speak of the Bannockburn event because Mr De Stefano has 

 now  been  the  subject  of  far  more  serious  allegations  than  any  on  the  

 bumper sticker.  

 

 In February 2003 Frank De Stefano was sentenced to ten years’ jail, with a 

 minimum  of  seven  years,  for  stealing  $8.3  million  from  clients  of  his  

  13

 

 accountancy practice. This included a $5 million damages payout to a client 

 who had been made a quadriplegic. 

 

 One  of  the  features  of  this  case,  common  in  suits  designed  to  silence  

 community protest, is that the writs were served on Christmas eve - a time 

 when it is difficult to obtain legal advice, so that a pall of tension is cast over 

 the festive season. 

 

 Those who paid out $10,000 for this action will not see their money - or the 

 trees - again. As a result of the writ - which never came to court - the fate 

 of  the  Bannockburn  woodland  was  decided  without  the  community  being  

 able to make a full contribution to the issues. 

 

 A feature of this case, very common in SLAPP suits, was the service of the 

 writs on Christmas eve. This creates maximum impact, as the persons sued 

 will  have  difficulty  obtaining  legal  advice,  and  it  casts  a  pall  of  uncertainty  

 over the festive season. 

 

 Being Forest Friendly 

 My  own  journey  in  relation  to  SLAPP  suits  began  in  1999  when  a  friend  

 Alan Gray rang me. It was the Thursday before Easter, and I was about to 

 go  on  holidays.  I  could  hear  the  fear  in  his  voice.  He  sounded  devastated. 

 “Brian,” he said, “I’m not feeling good - all I have worked to build for my 

 family - my house and my business - could go down the drain.” 

 

 Alan  was  then,  and  still  is,  the  editor  of  Earth  Garden  magazine.  He  had  

 written  a  book  called  “Forest  Friendly  Building  Timbers”.  BBC  Hardware  

 had agreed to stock the book throughout Australia  

 

  14

 

 Just  before  the  close  of  business  for  the  Easter  holidays  (Easter  time,  not  

 Christmas,  this  time),  the  solicitors  for  the  National  Association  of  Forest  

 Industries  sent  him  a  letter  threatening  to  take  him  to  court  for  deceptive  

 and misleading conduct under the Trade Practices Act, because the book made 

 a number of statements about the logging industry which they disputed. 

 

 The statements were all sourced and quoted from government reports. They 

 were indisputable. And there were good statutory defences under the TPA 

 anyway.  But  this  would  not  matter  -  Alan  Gray  could  not  afford  to  

 bankrupt himself in order to prove he was right. Even a few days in court 

 would be crippling.  

 

 NAFI  demanded  the  shredding  of  all  copies  of  the  book,  and  an  

 undertaking  not  to  repeat  any  of  these  statements.  Otherwise,  off  to  the  

 Federal  Court.  Alan,  unable  to  face  the  prospect  of  even  a  short  Federal  

 Court hearing, was at the point of capitulation. 

 

 The irony was that the Trade Practices Act is meant to be about consumer 

 protection,  and  the  logging  industry  wanted  to  keep  information  from  

 consumers to protect its own interests. 

 

 It was the modern equivalent of a mediaeval book burning. 

 

 I arranged for Alan to send the letter and the book immediately.  

 

 I  said  to  him  that  the  letter  meant  the  book  would  enjoy  greatly  increased  

 sales,  and  not  to  worry.  We  prepared  a  reply  telling  NAFI  to  get  lost  and  

 then sent the correspondence to every journalist we could think of. 

 

  15

 

 

 It  got  a  run  in  every  paper,  and  eventually  Professor  Alan  Fels  (head  of  

 ACCC)  offered  the  public  opinion  that  the  NAFI  letter  itself  may  well  

 amount to deceptive and misleading conduct, because anyone who knew the 

 workings of the TPA would know that the threat they made was empty. 

 

 We taunted NAFI to bring proceedings. They didn’t. The book was at the 

 top of the non-fiction best seller list for months. 

 

 There was one dark aspect of the outcome. BBC Hardwares issued a press 

 release which said: 

 BBC  Hardware  Limited  today  withdrew  from  sale  in  its  stores  a  booklet  titled   “Forest-Friendly Building Timbers”.   

 This  follows  a  threat  of  legal  action  against  BBC  Hardware  by  the  National   Association of Forest Industries, which took exception to the publication.2  

 NAFI’s  threat  of  legal  action  was  baseless.  They  did  not  even  issue  any  

 proceedings.  But  still  their  threat  pushed  “Forest-Friendly  Building  

 Timbers” off the shelves of the major hardware chain which had supported 

 it. 

 

 It’s a good example of the way some big business operators misuse the court 

 system - frequently without even having to take proceedings. In this case we 

 called their bluff, and that’s a good lesson in how to deal with SLAPP suits - 

 stick together, go public, and don’t let them get away with it. 

 

 PETA 

 

 2   BBC Hardware Media Statement 8 April 1999 

  16

 

 People  for  the  Ethical  Treatment  of  Animals  (PETA)  has  conducted  a  

 public  campaign  against  the  wool  industry’s  practice  of  “mulesing”  sheep  

 and against live exports.  

 

 As  part  of  its  campaign,  PETA  approached  retailers  by  letter  urging  them  

 not to purchase Australian wool products until the two practices end. 

 

 As  a  result,  the  industry’s  promotional  organisation,  Australian  Wool  

 Innovation  Ltd  (AWI),  has  commenced  legal  action  against  PETA  in  the  

 Federal  Court,  relying  on  the  Trade  Practices  Act.  AWI  has  asked  the  

 Federal  Court  to  grant  it  an  injunction  preventing  PETA  from  publishing  

 material  that  would  be  harmful  to  the  retailers’  trade,  and  staging  anti-mulesing protest demonstrations at retailers’ premises. 

 

 Now that the dispute is before the Court, it is, of course, entirely a matter 

 for  the  Federal  Court  to  decide  what  the  parties’  legal  rights  and  

 responsibilities are and PETA will have an opportunity to present its case to 

 the Court in opposition to the grant of injunctive relief. 

 

 However, if the Federal Court decides that the Trade Practices Act enables an 

 industry organisation to sue in response to criticism of industry practices, it 

 will have serious adverse implications for public discussion of controversial 

 issues that are of interest to consumers.  

 

 On 22nd March last Hely J struck out the Statement of Claim in the PETA 

 case. It remains to be seen whether the case will be repleaded.  

 

 The Sunday Age made the following comment 

  17

 

 AWI  appears  to  agree  that  the  case  has  little  chance  of  proceeding  in  its   current form, but is prepared to drag out its campaign until it can sue for  damages in the US. 

 AWI’s chairman, the former Howard minister Ian McLachlan, suggests his  group will seek to wear PETA down financially.   

 The paper quotes Mr McLachlan as saying:  “If we have a massive bill, so have they got a massive bill, This industry is  extremely  well  financed  and  these  sorts  of  crises  are  catered  for.  The   Australian wool industry is not going to walk away from something it’s been  building up for 200 years.”   

 The  community  should  be  able  to  mount  and  hear  a  campaign  about  

 mulesing and about live sheep exports without the threat of litigation. 

 

 Don’t corporations have rights too? 

 What is the reality when large corporations sue their critics? 

 

 The  corporate  world  is  better  able  to  access  the  justice  system  than  

 community  groups  or  individuals,  because  litigation  is  expensive.  Not  

 merely court fees, which are considerable, but lawyers’ fees are such that the 

 average person has no chance of funding major litigation. 

 

 Developers and other commercial organizations enjoy tax advantages when 

 they sue their critics - the expenses are tax deductible because they are part 

 of  the  income-earning  enterprise.  But  for  the  community  group  or  

 individual  who  acts  altruistically,  without  seeking  a  profit,  there  will  be  no  

 tax-deductibility.  The  community  group  has  a  significant  financial  

 disadvantage  right  there.  The  corporation  will  achieve  a  significant  tax  

 benefit for each dollar it spends. The community group will have to pay its 

 own way. 

 

  18

 

 The average person sued by a corporation stands to lose their home. If they 

 win - the best they can hope for is to have some of their legal costs paid by 

 the corporation. Even if they are successful they will generally have to pay 

 thousands to their own lawyers to cover the shortfall ordered by the court. 

 Either way, the community group faces crippling financial risk. 

 

 The corporation and its officers are under none of these pressures. Indeed, 

 if  they  win,  they  have  the  prospect  of  being  awarded  substantial  damages.  

 Generally the person sued has no such prospect. 

 

 Another  factor,  quite  apart  from  the  cost,  is  the  time  litigation  takes.  The  

 ABC’s  “Moonlight  State”  4  corners  program  ran  in  1988.  It  led  to  the  

 Fitzgerald Royal Commission and a change of government in Queensland. 

 But  the  litigation  against  Chris  Masters,  who  put  the  program  together,  

 continued for over 13 years. During that time litigants cannot just leave it to 

 their  lawyers.  They  have  to  respond  to  detailed  legal  documents,  such  as  

 interrogatories,  which  take  enormous  time.  They  have  to  give  instructions  

 for a myriad of decisions to be taken along the way. It will hang over them 

 throughout that time. 

 

 Where  people  use  their  spare  time  trying  to  improve  the  world,  as  well  as  

 juggling  professional  and  family  responsibilities,  litigation  is  likely  to  

 completely  consume  their  time,  and  at  least  keep  them  away  from  further  

 campaigning. This in itself is a win for the corporation concerned. 

 

 When community groups or individuals are sued, they feel shame, there can 

 be  bitterness  and  falling  out  under  the  stress  of  the  litigation,  and  others  

 who see the dilemma they are in are deterred from speaking out themselves. 

 This chill effect is one of the main reasons for SLAPP suits. 

  19

 

 

 The  vast  majority  of  SLAPP  suits  are  not  decided  by  the  courts  on  the  

 merits. They are decided by the financial pressures. The person sued can no 

 longer pay for their lawyer, and a deadline is missed. The other side enters 

 judgment. Or the person sued just gives up and files for bankruptcy. 

 

 Taking SLAPP suits on is all very well, and can make a big difference - look 

 at McLibel. But what a cost to those who took it on - 10 years of their lives. 

 No income. Not a great career choice. 

 

 In the real world, people are silenced by the mere issuing of SLAPP suits.  

 

 Of course corporations should be allowed to approach the courts - but they 

 should  not  be  permitted  to  abuse  the  court  system,  using  their  corporate  

 power  to  exhaust  and  silence  their  critics  rather  than  to  have  the  court  

 redress genuine and legally recognized grievances. When they do that, they 

 should be stopped. 

 

 Internationally Recognised Human Rights 

 After  the  Second  World  War,  and  in  particular  the  barbarous  tyrannies  of  

 Nazism,  the  world  determined  to  learn  from  that  episode.  In  1948  the  

 United  Nations  debated  and  passed  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  

 Rights.  

 

 The first three paragraphs of the Preamble are as follows: 

 PREAMBLE 

 Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and  inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the  foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,  

  20

 

 Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in  barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind,  and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy  freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has  been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people,  

 Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have  recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and  oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of  law,  

 And let me also read article 19 of the Declaration: 

 Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this  right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to  seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media  and regardless of frontiers. 

 Since then the UN has also agreed on the International Covenant on Civil 

 and Political Rights, article 19 of which again confirms the right to freedom 

 of expression.  

 

 Australia  is  a  signatory  to  these  great  human  rights  documents,  but  apart  

 from  the  ACT,  which  last  year  passed  an  excellent  Human  Rights  Act,  we  

 have never given legislative force to the universally recognized principles of 

 human rights. Australia is the only western country not to have done so. 

 

 The importance of Free Speech 

 So why is free speech important?  

 

 Without open speech, there is no real democracy. Votes will be delivered in 

 information  blackout,  the  voters  deceived  by  those  who  control  their  

 sources  of  information.  Citizens  will  not  lobby  about  some  problems,  for  

 they will not know of them.  

 

  21

 

 Public opinion will be manipulated by the powerful, and the enrichment and 

 greater  wisdom  that  comes  from  reflection  through  communication  with  

 each other will be lost. 

 

 Our political system is predicated on the capacity of citizens to contribute. 

 Citizens  can  vote  for  representatives.  Citizens  can  themselves  stand  for  

 election. Citizens can become involved in lobbying over a particular issue or 

 to further the electoral standing of a particular party or community group.  

 

 The  theory  is  that  decisions  are  not  imposed  by  arbitrary  force,  but  by  

 citizens  learning  from  each  other,  persuading  each  other,  so  that  good  

 government may grow from a sharing of ideas. 

 

 But it is not just a question of our system of government. The community is 

 not  merely  some  ether  that  binds  us  together  -  it  is  the  conversations  

 between  us.  Our  discussions  together  -  our  communications  -  are  the  

 community. 

 

 At  a  deeper  level  this  concerns  the  well-being  of  members  of  our  society.  

 Many in our community - particularly young people with all their idealism 

 and all they have to contribute - are literally dying from alienation. One way 

 or  another,  they  are  repeatedly  told  -  this  is  not  your  world  -  your  

 contribution is not wanted. Conform, consume, or get lost. Many of them, 

 in  an  act  of  defiance  against  a  system  which  seems  so  alien  to  them,  or  

 perhaps  out  of  justifiable  indifference,  don’t  even  bother  to  vote.  SLAPP  

 suits  are  one  way  -  of  many  -  in  which  they  are  given  the  message  that  

 questioning entrenched interests will be crushed. We are all the losers.  

 

  22

 

 Since  democracy  depends  on  the  exchange  of  ideas  and  opinions,  and  

 community requires communication between its members, it is essential that 

 citizens  have  the  freedom,  in  any  medium,  to  engage  in  public  debate,  to  

 express  points  of  view,  and  to  make  their  own  responses  to  the  world  

 around  them.  Freedom  of  expression  permits  knowledge  to  flourish  and  

 prejudices to be challenged, and diminishes the alienation of those who are 

 not heard. 

 

 Legislation 

 Words  matter.  They  can  hurt  and  harm,  as  well  as  bring  wisdom  and  

 healing.  The  same  words  that  inspire  one  hearer  will  outrage  another.  To  

 silence speech is to stifle the good with the bad.  

 

 Australia  has  no  comprehensive  protection  of  community  members  when  

 speaking  about  matters  of  public  interest  or  lobbying  for  change.  

 Commentary  on  these  things  ought  to  be  the  function  of  citizens.  They  

 should  be  protected  from  vexatious  court  proceedings  designed  to  shut  

 them up. 

 

 The phenomenon of writs to stop discourse has received judicial recognition 

 in  Australia.  As  Sir  William  Deane  said  in  Theophanous  v  Herald  and  Weekly  

 Times (1994) 182 CLR 184 

 the  use  of  defamation  proceedings  in  relation  to  political  communication  and  

 discussion has expanded to the stage where there is a widespread public perception 

 that such proceedings represent a valued source of tax-free profit for the holder of 

 high public office who is defamed and an effective way to “stop” political criticism, 

 particularly  at  election  times.  (Indeed,  the  phrase  “stop  writ”  has  entered  the  

 language.) 

 

  23

 

 

 In  the  United  States  and  Canada,  SLAPP  suits  have  grown  to  the  point  

 where legislatures have enacted laws to protect public participation. Almost 

 every state in the US has now done so, and some Provinces in Canada3.  

 

 These laws have various forms, but three features are:  

 (a) they  protect  public  participation  -  the  exchange  of  ideas  for  the  

 purpose of democratic decision-making - and make statements in 

 that context privileged4,  

 

 3   For example:  Delaware Code Sections 8136 - 8138; Code of Georgia § 9-11-11.1; 

 Hawaii  Revised  Statutes,  Chapter  634F; Indiana  Code  34-7-7;  Louisiana  Code  of  Civil  

 Procedure  Art.  971;  Section  5-807  Annotated  Code  of  Maryland  (HB  930);  

 Massachussetts  Statutes  Chapter  231,  Section  59H;  Minnesota  Statutes  Annotated  

 Chapter  554;  Missouri  RSMo  Sec  537.528;  Nebraska  Revised  Statutes  §§  25-21,241  

 through 25-21,246; Nevada Revised Statutes §§ 41.635 - 41.670; New Mexico Statutes §§ 

 38-2-9.1 and 9.2; New York Civil Rights Law 70-a and 76-a; Oregon Revised Statutes §§ 

 30.142  -  30.146;   Tennessee  Code  Annotated  §§  4-21-1001  through  4-21-1004; 

 Washington RCW  4.24.500  -  4.24.520  (this  is  the  first  modern  anti-slapp  legislation,  

 enacted in 1989 - it was amended in 2002 to take account of several court decisions)  4  Drawing on those models, I would suggest defining public participation as follows: 

 “public  participation”  means  communication  or  conduct  aimed  at  influencing   public  opinion,  or  promoting  or  furthering  lawful  action  by  the  public  or  by  any   government  body,  in  relation  to  an  issue  of  public  interest,  but  does  not  include   communication or conduct  

 (a)   in  respect  of  which  an  information  has  been  laid  or  an  indictment  has   been  preferred  in  a  prosecution  conducted  by  the  Director  of  Public   Prosecutions, 

 (b)  that constitutes a breach of any enactment, 

 (c) that contravenes any order of any court,  

 (d)  that  intentionally  or  recklessly  causes  damage  to  or  destruction  of  real   property or personal property,  

 (e)  that intentionally or recklessly causes physical injury,  

  24

 

 

 (b) they empower courts at an early stage to strike out actions brought 

 with the purpose of stifling free speech, and 

 (c) they give the courts power to order plaintiffs who bring actions to 

 silence the community to pay damages by way of punishment.  

 The  statutes  have  now  been  applied  in  a  number  of  cases.  The  volume  of  

 SLAPP  suits  has  dropped  enormously.  Australians  deserve  the  same  

 protection. 

 

 With  the  growing  phenomenon  in  Australia  of  SLAPP  suits  designed  to  

 have  a  chill  effect  on  public  involvement,  it  is  high  time  similar  laws  were  

 enacted here. Give us laws which protect public. 

 

 Uniform Defamation laws 

 A small but important step towards protection of public participation is the 

 proposal  by  State  and  Territories  Attorneys-General,  in  the  context  of  

 developing uniform defamation laws, that corporations should lose the right 

 to sue for defamation. This is opposed by the Federal Attorney-General. 

 

 Historically,  defamation  laws  were  about  the  protection  of  the  reputations  

 of  individuals.  There  are  taxation  and  other  benefits  in  organising  as  a  

 corporation. Unless people can speak freely about them, corporations would 

 be  free  to  operate  without  regard  to  community  values.  So  often  when  

 corporations  sue  an  individual  they  are  outlaying  a  negligible  amount  of  

 

 (f) that constitutes trespass to real or personal property, 

 (g) by way of advertising for commercial goods or services; or 

 (g)  that is otherwise considered by a court to be unlawful or an unwarranted  interference by the defendant with the rights or property of a person;  

 

  25

 

 money on a tax-deductible basis, whereas the individual stands to lose their 

 home. If corporations are to be kept accountable, people should be free to 

 speak about them. 

 

 The  need  for  this  change  has  received  added  urgency  with  the  

 corporatisation  of  many  public  services.  Why  should  a  public  transport  

 company be able to sue patrons who criticise the way it provides services?  

 

 In  2003,  Victoria’s  Public  Transport  Users’  Association,  a  lobby  group  

 which promotes the interests of public transport users, was concerned about 

 the  removal  of  seats  in  trams  operated  by  Yarra  Trams.  They  published  a  

 pamphlet which contained a cartoon of a sardine can with “Yarra Sardines” 

 on it. They called for more services, not less seats, and wrote “As a private 

 operator,  Yarra  Trams  is  mainly  focussed  on  cutting  costs,  rather  than  

 providing a useful service.” 

 

 Yarra Trams wrote to the PTUA saying that these statements expose “our 

 company  to  ridicule”  and  were  “defamatory”,  and  threatened,  unless  an  

 undertaking was received within hours that the brochure would no longer be 

 distributed,  to  take  “appropriate  legal  action  to  prevent  the  offending  

 pamphlet from being published”. 

 

 The PTUA obtained legal advice, and refused to buckle. In fact, they called 

 the press and distributed the brochures in front of them. But until they had 

 that advice, they were very worried.  

 

 Yarra Trams is a company providing a service to the public. It should not 

 have  a  right  to  sue  to  stop  the  public  commenting  on  its  performance.  If  

 corporations could not sue, threats like this one would not be made. 

  26

 

 

 

 New  South  Wales  has  already  changed  its  defamation  laws  to  prevent  

 corporations  suing5.  The  legislation  provides  that  a  corporation  “does  not  

 have the right to sue for defamation of the corporation”. 

 

 Conclusion 

 I  mentioned  earlier  that  the  demand  for  pulping  of  Alan  Gray’s  book  was  

 the  modern  equivalent  of  a  medieval  book  burning.  Of  course,  there  are  

 more  recent  examples  of  this  kind  of  activity.  On  10  May  1933  in  Berlin,  

 students  from  the  Wilhelm  Humboldt  University,  all  of  them  members  of  

 right-wing  student  organizations,  took  books  from  their  university  library  

 and from other collections. Accompanying their actions with denunciations 

 of  the  authors,  they  proceeded  to  toss  thousands  of  volumes,  by  writers  

 famous  and  obscure,  foreign  and  native,  into  the  flames  of  a  bonfire.  It  

 lasted  for  hours,  interrupted  only  by  the  incantation  of  Nazi  songs  and  a  

 speech by Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. 

 

 They  burnt  the  books  of  Albert  Einstein  and  of  Thomas  Mann  and  of  

 hundreds more. They also burnt the books of Helen Keller, the deaf, blind 

 author who was a legend even then. In a wonderful gesture of reconciliation 

 after the Great War she had donated the royalties of her books for all time 

 to the German soldiers blinded in that conflict.  

 

 She wrote an open letter to the book burners, which I paraphrase: 

 History has taught you nothing if you think you can kill ideas. Tyrants have tried 

 to do that often before, and the ideas have risen up in their might and destroyed 

 them.

 You can burn my books and the books of the best minds in Europe, and you can 

 even  burn  the  writers,  but  in  the  end  their  ideas  will  seep  through  a  million  

 channels to quicken other minds, and your bonfires will be left a flickering, lurid 

 darkness in the splendour  of their united wisdom.
