 AMA CALLS FOR PERMANENT PROTECTION FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS   

 EMBARGOED UNTIL 12 NOON SUNDAY 1 OCTOBER   

 The AMA has renewed its calls for the Government to cease the use of temporary protection visas  (TPV) in light of new research showing TPV holders are more likely to suffer severe and varied  mental health problems than people residing on permanent protection visas (PPV). 

 

 The research results appear in the latest edition of the Medical Journal of Australia.   

 The research, by specialist trauma psychologists and psychiatrists in Sydney, shows anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression are much more severe for TPV holders than for  holders of permanent protection visas (PPV).   

 AMA Vice President, Dr Choong-Siew Yong, said today the study confirms the AMA’s view that  there is no role for TPVs and asylum seekers and refugees should be granted PPVs if they are  assessed as being in need of protection.   

 “The very nature of TPVs leads to uncertainty and anxiety, with poor living conditions and prior  detention experiences possibly exacerbating PTSD.   

 “Those in detention should be detained for the shortest possible period of time.”   

 Dr Yong also emphasised the need for asylum seekers and refugees to have access to quality health  care and support services.   

 “All asylum seekers and refugees should have equal access to Government support services  including entitlement to family reunion and settlement services,” Dr Yong said.   

 “They have the right to receive appropriate medical care without discrimination, including access to  health care services, Medicare, the PBS, counselling, and education.   

 “All States and Territories should ensure that no asylum seeker is charged for treatment in public  hospitals.”   

 Dr Yong commended the research, saying that it adds to a growing body of evidence that TPV  holders experience persistent and diverse mental health problems.   

 “Governments need to cease to use TPVs if they are to prevent the devastating rise of mental health  problems in asylum seekers and refugees,” Dr Yong said.   

 “Those seeking asylum within Australia, independent of their citizenship or visa status, should be  treated with compassion, respect and dignity.”
