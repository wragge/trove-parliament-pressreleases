 CHAOS ON GOVERNMENTS DETENTION & OTHER  IMMIGRATION PRACTICES

 The Federal Court's order today th a t a Chinese asylum-seeker whoso refugee  application has been refused be released from detention highlights the chaos  surrounding the Government's detention and adm inistration practices.

 Under current migration legislation, the Government can only detain people who  have arrived in Australia without entry documentation for a maximum of 273  days., In the case of Jie Xin Tang, the Federal Court found th at the 273 days has  expired, and the Government no longer has legal authority to keep him in 

 detention.

 Mr Tang will now be released into the community, and has been ordered to  report regularly to the Departm ent of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs until his  application for refugee status has been finally resolved in the courts.

 The Government's handling of the boat people is-a shambles. It confirms the  serious concerns the Coalition and others have had about the administration of  our immigration program as a whole,

 Now, some boat people will be released into the community while their cases are  resolved, but others will not. There m  no established arrangem ents to deal with  boat people released into the community other than the presumably ad hoc terms  set by the Federal Court.

 Some boat people have been in detention for more than three years without  resolution of their cases. This has been at considerable cost to taxpayers (some  $21 million to date), and also at the cost of Australia's international reputation  on handling refugees. The fact th at the Federal Court case decision today was 

 concerned with how the Departm ent of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs calculated  the 273 days, demonstrates clearly either th a t the Departm ent failed in its  administrative responsibilities, or th a t the existing legislation is defective - or  both.

 The Government was recently forced to agree to a full inquiry into Australia s  detention practices by the Joint Parliam entary Committee on Migration.

 However, there is also an urgent need for a much wider review. I have called for  this on several occasions in recent months. So far the Minister, Senator Bolkus,  has been cither totally negative, or provided a deafening silence, in response.
