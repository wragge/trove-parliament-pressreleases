 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 Remaining West Papuan asylum seeker should be brought to  Melbourne 

 Senator Nettle, 1st May 2006   

 Following the further delay in court today in the case of the remaining West Papuan  asylum seeker on Christmas Island Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today  called for him to be brought to Melbourne, while the Immigration Department and the  courts decide whether he is granted a visa.    

 "I understand that there is no question that this man is a genuine refugee and it is just  technical issues which are being decided in his case," said Senator Nettle.    

 "I met this man with the 42 other West Papuans when I visited Christmas Island in  January. It is a very remote place and his isolation should end.    

 "This man should be brought to Melbourne on the next flight while his case is  finalised. He should be with his fellow West Papuans, not isolated on a remote island.    

 "He should be able to live in the community with his fellow West Papuans and  supporters until his case has been decided.    

 "If the government insists on his ongoing detention, then he should still be brought to  Melbourne so he can be near his friends and supporters.    

 "This man's father died in an Indonesian prison after being jailed for raising the West  Papuan flag and yet we continue to treat him like a criminal behind razor wire.
