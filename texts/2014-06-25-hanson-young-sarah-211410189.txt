 Licence to deport to danger: Greens    

 Legislation introduced by the Abbott government today is an ideological and dangerous attack  on vulnerable asylum seekers already here in Australia, the Australian Greens have said.     

 “This Bill is all about reducing the number of refugees Australia resettles and setting up the  framework to deport people back to danger”, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.      

 “It is an ideological attack on vulnerable people who have already been living in limbo for a  number of years, without legal assistance, and forcing them to prove their case for protection.     

 “Asylum seekers will now be forced to prove that they have over a fifty percent chance of being  killed or tortured.    

 “If you can’t prove that you are more likely to be shot than not, then you will be on your way  home.     

 “This piece of legislation is a dog whistle that prevents people who are in genuine fear of being  tortured or killed getting the protection they deserve.     

 “The whole purpose of this bill is to give Minister Morrison the power to deport more refugees  than he accepts.     

 “I will be appealing to the new cross bench to vote to block this cruel and draconian piece of  legislation.”
