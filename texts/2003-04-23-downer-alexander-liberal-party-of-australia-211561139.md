  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  HON ALEXANDER DOWNER, IMP 

  TRANSCRIPTION: PROOF COPY E & OE 

  DATE: April 23 2003 

  TITLE: Doorstop Interview - Stirling, South Australia 

  Downer:  relation to Anzac Day was issued on the 9* of April. This is subsequent to the receipt of the  information that is referred to in the newspaper today about possible terrorists crossing the  border into Turkey. And we have assessed that information, we’ve discussed that information 

  with Turkish authorities some time ago, some weeks ago now. And officials from Australia  have been to Turkey to talk through these issues. With all of this intelligence you have to  assess the credibility or otherwise of the information. And anyway, on the basis of this  analysis, we have maintained our view that Australians should be very careful in visiting 

  Turkey. In relation to Gallipoli, the Gallipoli Peninsula and the towns around it such as  Canakkale, we hold the view that the Turks are making a very substantial effort to provide  security there. They’re putting a lot of work into it this year. We’ve had substantial  discussions with them about the security they’re providing and on the basis of that we think  that Australians, should they choose to go to Gallipoli for the Anzac Day ceremony, should  just do so with a high degree of caution. But particularly in other parts of Turkey, but also in 

  Gallipoli. And that is the assessment that we make on the basis of the intelligence material,  the credibility of some of those intelligence reports and the like. But, there’s no doubt about  it, as we’ve said for quite some time now, there are risks in Turkey because there have been  explosions in Istanbul in the not too distant past. And we, all of us, have to be wary of the 

  dangers that visits to a country like Turkey, which borders Iraq, poses. 

  First of all, the travel advisory that was last issued by my Department in 

  Journalist: How safe is it for Australians going to Gallipoli at the moment? 

  Downer: Well OUT assessment is that if they choose to go, they should exercise a high  degree of caution wherever they go in Turkey, including Gallipoli, but we haven’t come out  and advised Australians not to visit Gallipoli this year. We haven’t said that our assessment  of all the intelligence material we have is such that we think it’s simply too dangerous for  people to go. That’s not our assessment, particularly bearing in mind the Turks are making a  major effort in terms of enhancing their security. 

  Journalist: How credible is the information? 

  Downer:  onto us by some elements of the Turkish Gendmarie, and it’s been assessed very carefully  I don’t really want to get into that. This is information that has been passed 

  Inquiries: (02) 6277 7500 

  by our intelligence agencies, by Turkish intelligence agencies and by the British and the  Americans. And the conclusions we have drawn are there in our travel advisory. 

  Journalist: What safeguards is the Government putting in place over there? 

  Downer:  Australians. This is Turkish territory. And we are satisfied that the Turks have made an  enormous effort this year to shore up security. They’ve always made an effort with security at  Gallipoli on Anzac Day, but they’ve made a particular effort this year. And we’ve been  happy with the plans the Turks have made to provide that security. There will be further 

  restrictions on Australians this year. For example, we would say to Australians, the Turks are  unlikely to allow them to carry very much in the way of their own travel bags and the like into  the National Park area, and into the Gallipoli area, because of the security that will be  provided. There will be a lot of security checks. We’d also ask those Australian who are 

  going to Gallipoli to make sure that they respect local customs and obviously, being a Muslim  country, there are particular local customs in relation to alcohol and the like, that it’s  important that Australians respect them. 

  Well the Turkish Government provides security at Gallipoli, obviously, not 

  Journalist:  visiting Gallipoli? I mean should they perhaps tell their kids not to go?  Do you have any message for parents whose children may be over there 

  Downer: No, I don’t think they should tell their kids not to go. But I think they should  just remind their kids, and I remind all Australians who are either on their way there, or there  already and can be contacted, to be very cautious - not just by the way, in Gallipoli, in fact  more importantly I would say in places like Istanbul. A lot of Australians who go to Gallipoli 

  go via Istanbul. There have been bomb explosions in Istanbul in the not to distant past, so it’s  important that they make sure that they are very cautious in what they do. For example, as we  say in relation to a number of other countries, visiting bars and clubs and other congregations  of Westerners, that is something to avoid. 

  Journalist:  interests by the end of the month?  What about the threat of attacks on western interests, including Australian 

  Downer: We have to assess this kind of information very cautiously. And we can’t  overreact. On the other hand we can’t afford to under react. We have to make cautious and  balanced judgements about the information as it becomes available. Now, April is a time  when terrorist activity has been at a reasonably high level in Turkey historically. So there are 

  risks that this could happen. There certainly are risks. But the Turks are making a great deal  of effort to shore up their security this year. 

  Journalist: What about Peter Costello? Is he going to go? 

  Downer: I believe so, yes. I think he is going. 

  Journalist: Do you think he should? 

  Downer:  advice to him as we do to other Australians visiting. If it came to a point where we advised  Yes, he’s sought the advice of me and my department and we provide the same 

  Inquiries: (02) 6277 7500 

  J AUSTRALIA &  4?>>>3>\&<<<

  Australians not to go, well then I guess in those circumstances he wouldn’t go -but that’s not  the advice that we’re providing. 

  Journalist:  monitoring?  Can I ask you about the Vietnamese boats? What’s happening there? Are you 

  Downer: We are doing our best. Of course, the Indonesians in the main are monitoring  these boats. We understand that one of the boats has broken down near Singapore, and that  the engine of the boat is said to be irreparable. I don’t know, but we’ve had that information  passed on to us. And I understand the Indonesians are monitoring the progress of the other  boat. It would be very difficult for boats like that to make a journey so far to Australia. I t 

  would be very difficult for them. 

  Journalist:  going to have on the people smuggling conference coming up next week?  Minister, what sort of impact do you think Indonesia’s handling of this is 

  Minister : We don’t know very much about the people on these boats. First of all, we  don’t know whether they’re being smuggled, whether they’re part of some racket, or what the  circumstances surrounding these journeys are. We don’t even know for sure whether these  people’s destination is Australia. Judging by the sorts of boats they have it would be very 

  difficult for them to get to Australia. But, it just reminds us that this is an issue which the  international community needs to continue to address, I think is addressing it, but can’t claim  that, and we never have claimed that there will never be another boat that sets sail in the  history of humankind. But nevertheless every effort is being made by us to ensure that this 

  issue is effectively addressed at the regional level. And the fact of us co-hosting a second  people-smuggling conference with the Indonesians illustrates the seriousness with which the  Indonesians take the issue. Though, the other thing I would say is that these particular  situations raise very sensitive questions and it is extrernely important not to handle this  through a process of megaphone diplomacy. We have had discussions with the Indonesians 

  about these boats, about allegations that one or both of them may be heading to Australia.  The Indonesians are still doing work on that and they have been co-operative. It’s not true  that they have been un-cooperative. 

  Journalist:  Indonesia over this?  So the relationship you wouldn’t suggest is strained between Australia and 

  Downer: No not at all. I would absolutely emphasise it’s not strained between Australia  and Indonesia. We have a good relationship. We have a very strong relationship with  Indonesia. They’ve done an excellent job over the last seventeen, eighteen months, whatever  it is, in addressing this issue as best they can. But look, Indonesia is a very big and complex  country and I would encourage people who speak so enthusiastically about the relationship  with Indonesia as though they know Indonesia, to learn a little about Indonesia. This is a very  big country, it has over 200 million people, it covers an enormous area of land and see. It has 

  something like 6,000 different islands and it is not an easy country for Jakarta to manage.  And there are all sorts of regional issues there and there are all sorts of diplomatic issues too.  So it has to be handled carefully, but it has to be handled with understanding. But I’ve been  happy with the way the Indonesians have been dealing with this. They haven’t been negative 

  Inquiries: (02) 6277 7500 

  or offensive or difficult. But they need to work through these issues in their own way, and  they’ve got their own way of doing these things. . 

  Journalist:  what’s happening in the Labor Party at the moment?  On another issue, as a former Opposition Leader, what are your views of 

  Downer:  Liberal Party has an outstanding Leader, it has an outstanding Leader-in-waiting. The Labor  Party doesn’t have any leadership at the moment and it has a Leader-in-waiting who has lost  two consecutive elections. I think the contrast is quite dramatic. But, the Labor Party will  have to work its way through these things. I think they are for us nothing more than  something to watch very cautiously. We make no judgements about how their leadership  issues are going to be resolved. That’s a matter for them. 

  The point I suppose about the Liberal Party and the Labor Party is that the 

  Journalist: Any advice for Mr Crean or Mr Beazley? 

  Downer: No, I don’t really offer them any particular advice. I know we have, over the  last twenty years, had some interesting experiences in the Liberal Party. But we’ve reached a  point now where we have an outstanding Leader and an outstanding Leader-in-waiting. As I  said, they have no Leader and they have a failed Leader-in-waiting, who has lost two elections  in a row. So it’s an interesting situation for them to work through. I give them no advice. 

  Journalist: Who’s your tip for the incumbent Leader? 

  Downer:  The impression I get - I’m not an expert on the Labor Party, though I know a fair bit about it  - but they seem to be very divided amongst themselves. You’ve got on the one hand Mr  Crean and his supporters of course, you’ve got on the other hand the Beazley group, but then  you’ve got a lot of opposition to Mr Beazley fiom people who think he’s lost two elections,  what chance him achieving a hat-trick? You’ve got the sort of people like Mr Rudd and Mr 

  Swan and Mr Latham who are all the time rushing around the Press Gallery promoting their  own causes. It’s an untidy situation - I’d say that. 

  Who do I think will lead the Labor Party to the next election? I don’t know. 

  Journalist:  the ball very firmly back in . . .  Does Mr Beazley have the ticker to challenge? I mean Simon Crean has put 

  Downer: You’ll have to ask him. Does he have the ticker to do a doorstop? 

  Journalist: Minister, you’ve been talking about terrorism and security. They’re very much  global and regional issues, but we’ve become very closely identified with the US, particularly  in Afghanistan and Iraq recently. Does that mean that we have any fences to mend, or bridges  to rebuild within the region to give us a better ability to respond to terrorism? 

  Downer: I think that argument, which I’ve heard on many occasions, is quite wrong.  First of all, in the region, many of the countries of the region strongly supported what the  Americans did in Iraq. Let’s not underestimate that. Secondly I think the Indonesians and to  some extent the Malaysians, but particularly let me pay credit here to the Indonesian  Government for the way it handled the Iraq issue through the Iraq War. I had discussions 

  Inquiries: (02) 6277 7500 

  with, not just of course the Indonesian Government in the period leading up to the war, which  I did, including with the President - but also discussions with religious leaders in Indonesia.  And I emphasise too the religious leaders there, the leaders of NU and Muhamnadiyah, the  two main religious Muslim organisations in Indonesia, that if there was to be a war against 

  Iraq this would not be a war against Islam and it’s very important to remember that. And I  think whatever the Indonesian leadership may have thought of the war - and they were critical  of it, there’s no question of that - but I think they managed the issue very well at home by  emphasising that whilst they disagreed with the war it was important to understand this wasn’t 

  a war against Islam. And I pay tribute to President Megawati and her Ministers for the  excellent job they did. And also to the religious leaders, the Muslim leaders of Indonesia as  well, for handling this issue very well. The demonstrations in Indonesia turned out to be  smaller than was expected and less violent than was feared. And I think the Indonesian 

  Government and the religious leaders have done a very good job in managing what in  Indonesia is a very difficult issue. And in terms of our relationship with them, I’m off to  Indonesia on Monday to co-host the 2nd people smuggling meeting. It simply illustrates the  strength of our ties with Indonesia that we could have, in the couple of weeks or so before the  war broke out a Ministerial Forum with Jakarta in Jakarta, with a record number of Ministers  on both sides, and within two weeks of the end of the war we’re co-hosting a regional  meeting. So, no, I think they’ve handled this issue well and I think in terms of our  relationship, we’ve handled it pretty well. 

  Journalist:  over our geography in pursuing our strategic relationships?  You don’t think the perceptions in the region is that we’ve chosen our history 

  Downer:  history, we have geography, we have interests. And let me make this point. I would have  thought the instability on the Korean Peninsula, the dangers of North Korea, illustrate to  Australians a very simple and a very clear point - that our alliance with the United States is 

  fundamental to the security of this nation and fhdamental to the security of the Asia-Pacific  region. And I think there are an awful lot more leaders in the Asia-Pacific region who  understand that simple point than there are critics amongst leaders. Yes, there are one or two  leaders in the region - there are only one or two - who take a swing at the United States fiom  to time. But overdl, there is a very great understanding in the region that the United States  plays a key role in the stability of the Asia-Pacific region. An absolutely central role. Take  the United States out of the security architecture of the Asia-Pacific region and imagine - who 

  would then deal with the problems of North Korea? Who would then provide, underwrite the  security of South Korea, and of Japan? How would those countries respond in that sort of  environment, and how would their neighbours respond? A tremendously important issue, the  presence of the United States in the security architecture of the Asia-Pacific region. And it’s  why critics of Australia’s close relationship with the United States simply don’t get it. They 

  simply do not understand the central role of the United States to the security of the region.  And you shouldn’t pursue foreign policy as some kind of a political game - ‘oh we’ve got to  be seen to be criticising the United States, we’ve got to be seen to be distancing ourselves  fiom the United States’. We will if it’s in our national interests. And we won’t if it isn’t.  And a lot of those people are more interested in their anti-American rhetoric that they are in  their national interest. I mean people in Australia, I’m not referring to people in the region. 

  No we choose our interests. That’s what drives our foreign policy. We have a

  Journalist: Can I just ask you, back to the cooperation of Indonesia with the current boat  situation? I know you just said it’s not confirmed whether they’re asylum seekers, but  there’ve been reports that a (inaudible) fi-om Jakarta says they’re not obliged to deal with the  situation. 

  Downer:  have been. And they have never indicated that they propose to be. I can’t think of another  ASEAN country which is a signatory to the Refugee Convention. But it’s something that  western countries tend to have done, in the main, but not only. Anyway I may be wrong, 

  there may be one or two, but in the main they are not signatories to that Convention. But  they’ve started to put together legislative reforms to address the problem of people smuggling  and they’re working their way through these issues. But as I said, you’re dealing with a  different type of country fiom Australia, it’s a more complex kind of situation. And I think 

  the Indonesians are handling the issue as best they can in the circumstances. 

  They’re not signatories are they, to the UN Refugee Convention. They never 

  Journalist:  find nothing, will you be embarrassed?  Can I ask you, just quickly about Iraq? If weapons inspectors go back in and 

  Downer:  fact that Iraq has been a country which has possessed and used weapons of mass destruction,  and the regime of Saddam Hussein has been strenuously endeavouring to try to deceive the  United Nations inspectors, and to hide his weapons of mass destruction capability and that’s a  point we’ve made all along. Now we’re endeavouring to track down what they’ve hidden and  we will succeed. It will take some time, but we will succeed in that task. That work is a work  in progress. 

  Well I don’t think they’ll find nothing. Look there’s just no argument with the 

  Journalist: Just one more, leading on fi-om Greg’s question earlier. Do you think that we  have a bit of rebuilding to do in terms of our reputation in the region as a key player in Asia-  Pacific security, given that the United States has taken such a leading role? We’ve been  positioning ourselves for so many years to be a major influence in the region, do you think  that we may have lost a bit of ground there? 

  Downer: No. On the contrary, I think most leaders in the Asia-Pacific region, if not all  - probably all leaders in the Asia-Pacific region recognise the fundamental importance of the  United States to regional security architecture. And there are a series of alliance arrangements  that the United States has in the region which enable it to provide that stabilising role. 

  There’s the alliance with Japan, there’s the alliance with Australia, and it also has alliances  which are less robust alliances, but alliances all the same nevertheless, with the Philippines,  Thailand, very close arrangements with Singapore. You shouldn’t underestimate these things.  You shouldn’t underestimate the perception in the region of the importance of the United 

  States to the region. Now, in the region they have different views on the issue of Iraq. But  many countries in the region did support the United States and very few countries criticised  the United States. Some did, but not many countries criticised the United States. And quite  apart fi-om anythmg else, I think the close relationship Australia has with the United States in 

  the region is an enormous benefit to Australia. The United States is not just some passing  nation. The United States is by a very very big margin the world’s most powerful nation. It’s  the world’s biggest economy, by a massive degree. It has the world’s most sophisticated  military, by a massive margin. And the close relationship that Australia has with the United 

  Inquiries: (02) 6277 7500 

  States, the fact that we have access to the President and to senior officials in the United States  Administration to the extent most other countries on earth don’t have, is an enonnous bonus  to Australia. And if we were to walk away fi-om the American alliance, and by that I mean a  strong American alliance, not just a bit of loose rhetoric about it -but fkom a strong 

  commitment to that American alliance, I think it would in the end very severely damage our  standing in the region, because we’d be seen as a much less significant player than we are.  We are one of the major players in the international community and the way we achieved that  is partly through the very nature of Australia, but it’s partly through our very close and 

  influential relationship with the United States - a relationship that few other countries have.  Journalist: Just about Bougainville - I understand the Peace Monitoring Group are  coming out on June 30. There are claims on the ground up there that there will be a power  vacuum that could lead to unrest. Is there any . . . 

  Downer: We’re very conscious of this, and I really do want to get the peace Monitoring  Group out by the end of June, and we’re doing everytlung we can to make that happen. But  whether there will be some other arrangement that will replace it we’re still having a look at.  But the Peace Monitoring Group as it’s currently structured we want to have out of there by  the end of June. The weapons collection process, the disarmament process, has been very 

  successful in Bougainville. Let’s not underestimate that. It’s estimated that about 91 per cent  of weapons have now been collected in Bougainville and containerised. That is a very good  outcome. Now there are still some left, but we hope that the United Nations official in  Bougainville, Mr Sinclair, will sign off on this weapons collection process fairly soon. And I  think once that’s happened, then the role of the Peace Monitoring Group will be substantially  less significant than it has been in the past. 

  Journalist: Could any government officials or anyone stay there just to keep a watch? 

  Downer:  Monitoring Group in its present format we would like to see out of there by the 3 0 ~  of June.  Whether anybody else would go in there, whether we would have any body from Australia  there playing a sort of watching role, we would have to look at that - we’re giving some 

  consideration to that. But it depends on the situation on the ground when we get to the end of  June. It’s not very far away I appreciate, but as you can tell listening to me, we’re very  focused on this issue. 

  It’s conceivable. But, we’ll have to wait and see. Certainly the Peace
