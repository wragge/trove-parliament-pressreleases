 Show some compassion for the children Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, today condemned the lack of compassion being shown for the children held in Australia’s detention centres by the Howard Government.

 Senator Stott Despoja called for a more responsible and humane approach to be adopted and reiterated the Democrats’ call for Immigration Minister, Philip Ruddock, to resign over his continuing inability to properly manage the centres.

 “Children are witnessing horrific acts within these centres.  Not only have they had to deal with leaving their homeland to travel to Australia, they are now being subjected to the trauma of imprisonment,” said Senator Stott Despoja.

 “The situation at Woomera detention centre appears to be getting more desperate. We cannot imagine the psychological damage the continuing unrest and protests are having on the children.

 “The Democrats call for all children to be removed from detention. At the least, unaccompanied minors must be removed.  Children should be relocated into the community while their claims are being assessed.

 “In an ideal world, children and their mothers should be placed into group homes outside of detention centres and unescorted minors should be released into the care of church and welfare agencies in the community.

 “Minister Ruddock is missing the point if he thinks this is about being pressured into granting visas.

 “This is about treating children with respect and humanity.

 “Children are innocent victims of the Howard Government’s hard-hearted approach to immigration. The fact is that most of these children are likely to qualify for refugee status,” said Senator Stott Despoja.

 “Minister Ruddock today has flagged children being separated from their parents if it is proven their parents coerced them into protests.  We call on the Minister to provide more detail on this proposal,” concluded Senator Stott Despoja.

 As of 7/9/01 there were 633 minors in Australian Detention Centres, including 111 unaccompanied minors.
