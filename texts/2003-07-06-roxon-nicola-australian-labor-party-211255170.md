 ADMINISTRATIVELY MORE CONVENIENT   OR POLITICALLY MORE CONVENIENT?   

 

 Minister Ruddock stated on the Sunday Program this morning that it was  “administratively more convenient” to process 54 people who arrived by boat this week  on Christmas Island, rather than at Port Hedland. M

 E D I A  R E L E A S E  

 

 Who is the Minister kidding?   

 Perhaps the Minister would like to explain just how his bungled decision to transport  people to Christmas Island who were already in Australia’s migration zone is  “administratively convenient,” particularly given the cost involved.     

 Now that the Minister has confirmed these people will have the same rights as they  would in Port Hedland, can the Minister make public the cost of transporting, housing  and processing these 54 people on Christmas Island?     

 In particular, can he advise:  â¢ The cost of transporting people using the frigate HMAS Canberra  â¢ The cost of flying 29 DIMIA staff to Christmas Island on Friday  â¢ The cost of preparing and re-opening the facility and Christmas Island  â¢ The cost of flying food and medical supplies to Christmas Island for the staff 

 and the detainees. 

 

 Can the Minister also confirm reports from the Parliamentary Committee that returned  yesterday from Christmas Island that at the time of their inspection of facilities there was  only one bed in the medical centre and no medical supplies or food?   

 What assurances can the Minister give that the 54 people (including 8 children and an  infant) are being detained in appropriate conditions and will have access to adequate  medical facilities and food?
