  IA RELEASE 

  Peter Slipper MP 4 !%&9 . Federal Member for Fisher $#e Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration   Fraser living in fantasyland 

  Federal Member for Fisher, Peter Slipper has today condemned former Prime Minister Malcolm Fra:;er   for labelling Australians concerned about illegal immigration as “rednecks”. 

  Mr Slipper said Mr Fraser’s comments were offensive and out of touch and showed he was living in   fantasyland if he thought ordinary Australians were “rednecks”. 

  “The fact that a huge number of Austrahans are deeply concerned about the behaviour and cost of illegal   immigrants, does in no way, shape, or form, make them ‘rednecks’,” Mr Slipper said. 

  Mr Slipper said Malcolm Fraser should apoiogise to the Australian public for his offensive comments. 

  “If Mr Fraser believes he is in touch with ‘those in the middle ground’ on this issue, he is kidding himself. 

  “In my view, Mr Fraser has led the good life for too long, and I don’t really think he has any idea of how   ordinary Australians think on these matters,” Mr Slipper said. 

  Mr Slipper also said that the way some illegal immigrants had been behaving in detention centres WLS   overshadowing Australia’s efforts to help those genuinely seeking refuge. 

  “The Government is working hard to assist refugees and others with real humanitarian needs. It is &t-y   hard, however, to paint a positive picture of this work, when a small number of queue jumpers and other   illegals with no right to be here, cause trouble and create violence. 

  “Unfortunately, people like Malcolm Fraser are sending a message that suggests Australians should   tolerate the behaviour of illegal immigrants and turn a blind eye to their disgraceful and sometimes   criminal activities.”
