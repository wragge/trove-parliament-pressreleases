 A.L.P. Moves for Parliamentary Committee  Examination of New Arrival Rules The Federal Opposition will move for a detailed parliamentary examination o f the  Government's legislation which denies new arrivals to Australia access to normal  welfare entitlements for two years.

 “There are a number o f ambiguities and potential savage consequences which need to  be looked at carefully when the legislation is introducedShadow  Immigration  Minister Duncan Kerr said. .

 "We will be proposing that the legislation be referred to the joint parliamentary  committee on immigration matters.

 “Our key concerns include making sure that there is no breach o f the Government's  pre-election pledge that the new changes will not be retrospective, and that there is an  adequate and sound safety net provided for people whose circumstances change after  their arrival which are beyond their control. »

 “The Government also promised to exempt refugee arrivals from these changes, but  there are fears that the exemption will not cover the immediate family o f the refugee,  who may arrive later.

 “So while an individual may be covered, his or her family could be left in abject  poverty.”

 M r Kerr said the Government bad failed to consult with the wider community either in  the development o f the policy or in the drafting o f the legislation. ..72

 “No one has seen the legislation, and it needs a  dose examination to make sure that  those affected are not made destitute.

 “The only way all the consequences o f the legislation can be thought through, is to  allow for a  process o f public examination by allowing a parliamentary committee to  hear submissions on the matter.”

 Mr Kerr called on the Government to make available an exposure draft o f its  legislation as soon as possible.

 “The Opposition will seek support from the Democrats, Greens and Independent  Senator Brian Harradine to force a  parliamentary examination if  the Government  refuses to take this initiative itself.”
