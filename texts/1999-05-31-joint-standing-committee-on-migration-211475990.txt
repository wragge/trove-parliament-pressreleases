  Media Release

  JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON MIGRATION

  Chair:

  Mrs Chris Gallus, MP

  

 31 May 1999

  

  Committee finds refugee review fee should stay

  

  The Joint Standing Committee on Migration has recommended maintaining 
the $1,000 fee on unsuccessful applicants  to the Refugee Review 
Tribunal, the Chair of the Committee, Mrs Chris Gallus, announced today.

  

 Mrs Gallus was speaking at the conclusion of the Committee’s 
inquiry into Migration Regulation 4.31B.

  

 “The regulation forms part of a package of measures 
to deter non-genuine applicants,” said Mrs Gallus.

  

 “The Minister asked us to examine the regulation 
on 6 January 1999. This followed a commitment in 1997 that the fee would 
be reviewed within 2 years.”

  

 During the inquiry that collected 24 submissions and 
over 100 pages of transcript evidence, some groups expressed concern 
that the fee could be stopping genuine refugees from appealing.

  

 “The groups who suggested this failed to produce 
appropriate cases that would have supported their claim,” Mrs Gallus 
said.

  

 “The Department of Immigration provided evidence 
that the numbers of refugees from countries where refugees had traditionally 
come had not decreased; but the numbers from traditionally low refugee 
producing countries had gone down.”

  

 “However, we felt that 2 years had not been long 
enough to provide unequivocal evidence and for this reason we recommended 
that the regulation be looked at in another three years.
