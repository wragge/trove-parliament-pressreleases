 Australia commits an additional $24 million to Pakistan flood  relief 

 Media release 

 

 17 August 2010 

 

 Over recent days the flood disaster in Pakistan has worsened. 

 The Pakistan Government now estimates that more than a third of Pakistan is being directly impacted on 

 by the floods. Up to 20 million people have been adversely affected and over 750,000 homes have been 

 damaged or destroyed. Dehydration and water borne diseases such as Cholera are of increasing concern. 

 In response to the United Nations and the Pakistan Government’s appeal for further international 

 assistance, Australia will provide an additional $24 million to support emergency humanitarian relief efforts 

 in the worst affected provinces. 

 This brings total Australian assistance to date to $35 million. 

 The additional assistance announced today will include: 

 â¢ $10 million to the World Food Programme to provide food to two million people over the next 

 fortnight and feed a further six million people by the end of September  

 â¢ $5 million to UNICEF to provide clean water and sanitation services to two million people to halt 

 the spread of disease  

 â¢ $3 million to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to provide emergency shelter and 

 blankets for the estimated 300,000 families who have lost their homes  

 â¢ $2.5 million to the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to deliver 

 emergency shelter and supplies to more than 175,000 people and help evacuate families at risk  

 â¢ $2.5 million to Australian Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) for food, shelter and other 

 emergency relief to help at least 250,000 people  

 â¢ $1 million to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to coordinate 

 and support the Pakistan Government’s response to the crisis.  

 Australia was one of the first donors to respond to the emergency. 

 As the disaster unfolded in the first week of August, Australia announced $10 million in humanitarian relief, 

 of which:  

 â¢ $4 million has been provided to the World Food Programme  

 â¢ $4 million has been provided to the Pakistan Emergency Response Fund and Red Cross/Red 

 Crescent Movement  

 â¢ $2 million has been provided to Australian Non-Government Organisations, including $500,000 to 

 Oxfam Australia; $500,000 to Save the Children; $500,000 to Care Australia; $350,000 to World 

 Vision Australia; and $150,000 to ActionAID.  

 Australia is also providing $1 million in relief supplies airlifted to Pakistan by the Australian Defence Forces. 

 The first Australian C-17 Globemaster defence aircraft landed in Pakistan on 14 August and delivered 

 tents, tarpaulins, water purification supplies, birthing kits and generators to the Pakistan National Disaster 

 Management Agency and the UN Population Fund. 

 These relief items are being airlifted by the Pakistan Military to affected populations in the south of the 

 country. 

 A second flight carrying tents, tarpaulins, and water storage and purification supplies left the RAAF base at 

 Amberley yesterday. 

 A third relief flight is scheduled to depart Amberley on Thursday 19 August. 

 In addition, 10 Australian humanitarian experts are being sent to Pakistan to join the relief effort. Two 

 people will work with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to coordinate 

 relief efforts. Two people will join the World Food Programme to assist with food distribution. Six personnel 

 will work with the Australian Red Cross to provide affected communities with safe drinking water and 

 primary health care. 

 Australia is also participating in the United Nations Disaster Assessment Mission currently underway in 

 Pakistan and is prepared to support the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to undertake 

 damage and needs assessments. 

 Australian officials remain in close contact with United Nations agencies and the Pakistan Government to 

 assess what more can be done. 

 Australian NGOs have called for public contributions to their Pakistan appeals and I encourage people to 

 give generously.
