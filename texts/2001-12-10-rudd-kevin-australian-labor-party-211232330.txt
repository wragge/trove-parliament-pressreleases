 KEVIN RUDD M.P. Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs

 MEDIA RELEASE

 RUDD TO VISIT ISLAMABAD AND PAKISTAN / AFGHANISTAN BORDER

 Shadow Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd will depart this morning for Islamabad for a four-day visit co-ordinated by the Government of Pakistan and the United Nations agencies in Islamabad.

 Mr Rudd said the purpose of his visit was three-fold:

 â¢ To investigate the quantum of the humanitarian crisis both within Afghanistan and Pakistan arising from the war;

 â¢ To analyse the operational and resource capacity of the UN agencies (and the Government of Pakistan) to meet the humanitarian needs; to identify gaps between resource commitments of the donor countries and the needs profile; and to examine additional resources which may be needed from the international community - including Australia;

 â¢ To examine the proposed reconstruction program for Afghanistan being put together by the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs; the timetable for implementation; and the impact of reconstruction on the early re-settlement of displaced persons.

 “The international community, including Australia, has fundamental humanitarian obligations to assist persons displaced by war,” Mr Rudd said.

 “Furthermore, unless the international community acts to address the refugee problem at source, both in Afghanistan and Pakistan, then other policy responses aimed at dealing with the problem elsewhere in the region will never be adequate.

 “Apart from being briefed by Pakistani and UN officials in Islamabad, I will also be visiting refugee camps along the border.

 “My intention is to produce a report on my findings for the Parliament and for the Australian Government, should they be interested in it.”

 Media outlets will be advised of contact details for Mr Rudd in Islamabad during the course of today.

 Mr Rudd’s itinerary will be as follows:

 â¢ dep Brisbane: 0910 (Brisbane time), Monday 10 December (Flight QF 517)

 â¢ arr Sydney: 1140 (daylight saving time), Monday 10 December

 â¢ dep Sydney: 1330 (daylight saving time), Monday 10 December (Flight QF 123)

 â¢ arr Islamabad: 1755 (local time*), Tuesday 11 December.
