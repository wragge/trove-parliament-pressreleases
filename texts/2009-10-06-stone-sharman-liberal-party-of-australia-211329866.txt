 Rudd's Sri Lankan PR campaign: too little, too late 

 The Hon Dr Sharman Stone MP   Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 After having been in denial for over a year, the Rudd Government has finally conceded its  softening of immigration policies has led to over 1800 people being smuggled into Australia.  

 Unfortunately the Government action seems to be little more than a public relations campaign  with street theatre, book marks, posters and seminars.  

 This begs the question, why only a public relations campaign and why only in Sri Lanka?  

 Why not run campaigns in Indonesia, Afghanistan, Pakistan or Malaysia? These countries are  where the majority of smugglers operate and run their most lucrative trade.  

 We are told the campaign has been five months in the making and will cost many millions of  dollars.  

 These millions should have been spent earlier and on the sharper end of deterrence.  

 Since the Rudd Government began softening immigration policies in August 2008, 39 boats  carrying 1873 people have been intercepted in Australian waters. There have been both  deaths and terrible injuries over that time.  

 At this rate the people smugglers will have more control over our refugee/humanitarian  intake than the Rudd Government.  

 Every unauthorised arrival is included in Australia’s annual 13,500 humanitarian/refugee  intake, which means those people wanting to enter Australia legally and through the proper  channels are unfairly disadvantaged.
