 13TH BOAT SINCE TONY ABBOTT REJECTED  AGREEMENT THAT WOULD STOP THE BOATS   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said today’s boat arrival is further evidence of the consequences of  the Coalition’s stubborn refusal to accept the Government’s offer to work together to  prevent people from risking their lives at sea.    

 The latest boat, carrying 43 asylum seekers, was the 13th since Tony Abbott refused to work  in the national interest to implement offshore processing.   

 “The Coalition can’t have it both ways,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “They want to deny the Government the ability to limit or stop boat arrivals and at the same  time attack the Government for the number of boat arrivals.”   

 Mr Clare said it was time for Tony Abbott to put Australia’s interests ahead of his own  political interests.    

 “It’s time for Tony Abbott to stop standing in the way of the Malaysian Agreement,” Mr Clare  said.   

 “It’s time for Tony Abbott to stop saying no and pass our legislation to allow offshore  processing in Malaysia and Nauru.”
