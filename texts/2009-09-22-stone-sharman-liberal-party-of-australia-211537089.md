 NO ROOM FOR BOAT ARRIVALS 

 The Hon Dr Sharman Stone MP  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 According to Sharman Stone, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the Darwin Detention Centre is 

 adequate for the short term accommodation of the men and boys who are arrested as illegal fishers in northern 

 Australian waters.  

 The facility, which Dr Stone inspected today, consists of a collection of pre-loved demountables that are enclosed 

 into a comparatively small space and embedded within the Berrimah Defence Force Compound in Darwin.  

 While Dr Stone was allowed to inspect the Darwin facilities, she continues to be denied official access to 

 Christmas Island.  

 “Because the Illegal fishers are only accommodated for days at a time, they have not needed a great deal of out 

 door space, recreational facilities, exercise facilities, places to learn English and certainly there are no places for 

 women and only 16 beds for minors, “ Dr Stone said.  

 “Clearly Minister Evans expects to see Darwin Detention Centre take up the extra thousands now queuing in 

 Indonesia. A major refurbishment of this facility will be required.  

 “A far better alternative for the Rudd Labor Government would be for them to urgently address the factors which 

 are now enticing the people smugglers to bring record numbers of paying clients from Indonesia down to our 

 migration exclusion zones.  

 “As long as the Rudd Government continues to unravel what were once strong border protection and immigration 

 policies, then we can expect to see these numbers of boat arrivals continue.”  

 Dr Stone said in this last wave of 6 boats in 8 days, we are told the voyagers were significantly stressed and 

 dehydrated in one boat.  

 “We may not ever know if these boats were in fact lost at sea,” Dr Stone said.  

 “Indonesian officials are working hard to intercept the waves of asylum seekers now moving off their shore.  

 “The Rudd Labor Government seems paralysed; they must most urgently restrengthen the strategies that put 

 people smugglers at bay in the past.  

 “It is certainly no comfort for the people of Darwin and Western Australia to know that the only strategy under 

 consideration by the Rudd Government is where to house the new arrivals who manage to survive the journey,” 

 Dr Stone said.
