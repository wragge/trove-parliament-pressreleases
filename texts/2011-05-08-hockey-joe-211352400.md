 ABC INSIDERS - INTERVIEW WITH BARRIE CASSIDY 

 8TH MAY 2011 

 E&OE………………………………………………………………………………… 

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 Joe Hockey, good morning.  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Good morning Barry and happy mothers’ day.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY:  

 Well. 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Or to my mum, happy mothers’ day.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 What do you make of that initiative that is virtually a swap with Malaysia?  

 JOE HOCKEY:  

 Well, I must say, when I first heard about it I thought kids in the schoolyard would do a better trading deal than  this but this is trading human beings. It seems like it is a panicked reaction to a failed border protection policy.  Quite frankly, it illustrates the fact that this Government has no sense of having a consistent policy on border  protection.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 This is the first time, though, that any government has introduced something that might be a really effective  deterrent in that these people will know that if they make the trip, they will end up at the back of a queue in  Malaysia.  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Hang on, we set up the Pacific Solution but it also had temporary protection visas as well. This is a temporary  solution. On the one hand Wayne Swan says this is the first step with Malaysia, on the other hand, the High  Commissioner for Malaysia has said this is a one-off. This illustrates the panic of the Government, the fact that  under them border protection policies have failed. There are more than 11,000 people that have come on boats  since this Government was elected, Barrie, and they are spending close to a billion dollars on this. This year  alone, they are spending three-quarters of a billion dollars trying to manage centres, for example, like Villawood,  that are on fire. It is just bizarre politics, it is bad policy. I think it illustrates what a failed government it is.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 You said you did something like this in Nauru, the difference is almost all of those people ended all of those  people ended up in Australia out of Nauru.  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 That is actually not right, according to Chris Evans, less than 50% actually ended up in Australia out of Nauru. 

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 Well you know the number with this plan is zero.  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 No, it isn't. It is 4,000 refugees coming here. 4,000 refugees are going to come to Australia, this time through  Malaysia.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 They are people who have stood in the queue and done everything right.  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 In Malaysia. 

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 Why shouldn't they be given entry to Australia?  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Because it is a trade-off. We are sending them 800 people on boats, which is about 12 boats, so it is a temporary  solution.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 But you are constantly saying people should do the right thing and stand in the queue. These people in Malaysia,  the 4,000 they will take have done that. Why shouldn't they be shouldn't they be rewarded in that way?  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 From our perspective, it means the Malaysians are having an influence on our refugee program, rather than our  own Government.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 Can we use the 4,000? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Our strong view is that you have to manage our own borders, that means managing the policy of your own  borders. That means Malaysia doesn't say it is going to send 4,000 people here, it means our Government says  we are going to take people from these parts of the world under these circumstances. We are not going to have  anything defined by the Malaysian government. From our perspective you need to retain control. With Nauru we  retained control. Under this circumstance, it is a bi-lateral deal with another country and even today they appear  to be at odds with us on policy.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 Let’s talk about the Budget. What do you think should be the government’s main aim? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Well it has to get back to surplus, Labor will never deliver a surplus Budget Barrie.  They never will.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 2012-13?  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 They won’t deliver it. Labor has always talked about surplus Budgets, they never will deliver a surplus Budget.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 But there is a massive political imperative this time around, if not an economic one. You still doubt they will get  there in 2012-13?  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 On Budget night when they claim to deliver a surplus in 2012-13 there will be a gaping hole and the hole will be  the carbon tax. The revenue figures in 2012-13 will be wrong because there is no carbon tax. The expenditure  figures will be wrong. The inflation figure will be wrong. The growth figure will be wrong.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 It is true that the carbon tax figures won't be there but isn't it generally accepted that the figures will be broadly  neutral in that first year? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 No, because revenue will be higher, we want to see the government keep to its own fiscal goals that it doesn’t  talk about anymore. That it is going to have revenue at no more than 23.5% of GDP - the level at the last year of 

 the Howard government. Secondly, it is not going to spend more than 2% in real terms in growth. Thirdly, they  said they were going to have a Budget surplus over the fiscal cycle. I say to you, if the carbon tax is in there I  would expect that all the rules would be broken. Obviously, when it comes to revenue and expenditure, the  numbers will be wrong on Budget night because it does not include the carbon tax. To make this point, on Budget  night, in 2012-13, the mining tax will be in the Budget, the carbon tax will not and they both start on exactly the  same day.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 You are saying that you can get the Budget back into surplus before 2012-13.  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 I said we would try to do it, yes.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 Could you? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 I don't know what the numbers are. We will see on Tuesday night. We outlined before the last election over $50  billion of savings including reducing the Commonwealth public service by 12,000. They were hard measures,  Barrie, but we are determined to do it. If you want to take pressure off families, if you want to take upward  pressure off interest rates, you have to get back to surplus as quickly as possible...  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 Just on that $50 billion figure you mentioned, was discredited immediately after the election.  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Well it was so discredited that the government itself used some of the measures they discredited.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY:  

 What about cost of living pressures, what should they be doing about that?  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 The best thing you can do is take upward pressure off interest rates at this moment. The starting point has to be  to stop spending so much money. This week we have seen the government spending enormous amounts of  money. Julia Gillard got off the plane and she decided to smoke her credit card with the Australian people - over  $1.5 billion they committed. Even today they are handing out set-top boxes to pensioners. The secret to getting  into surplus is to stop spending so much money.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 You wouldn’t be handing out the set top boxes?  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 We wouldn’t be spending so much money.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 Would you be handing out the set top boxes?  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Can I tell you Barry, there will be instances where you have an initiative here and an initiative there. The bottom  line is this government said it was going to have a tough Budget. It is not having a tough Budget because all it  has done in the last five days is announce expenditure items. It illustrates that Wayne Swan has lost control of his  own Budget. It couldn't be better illustrated than the fact that this morning on TV Wayne Swan said he would not  confirm cuts to the defence Budget. But, in fact, Stephen Smith went on radio and confirmed $300 million of cuts  - his own defence minister!  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 It was to the civilian arm of that.  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 The fact is the Defence Minister is out there announcing cuts in the Budget and now the Treasurer won't confirm  them - and his own defence minister went out and announced them. It is a confused message. What it illustrates  is the Government has no direction and can't be trusted at its word.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY:  

 I just want to explore the cost of living thing one more time. The Herald Sun this week published some research  they commissioned from the University of Canberra that shows the average household is $23 a day better off  than five years ago. Do you accept that?  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 No, I think cost of living is the biggest issue for Australians.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 They have done the work, they have done the research, that has to beat political rhetoric anytime.  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 If you go and speak to every day Australians, they are doing it tougher, their electricity prices are up, their  housing costs are up, the cost of food and vegies is up.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 No, that is anecdotal evidence. This is research.  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 It is not anecdotal evidence, it is reflected in the CPI numbers. What comes through in the CPI numbers - which is  fact - is that the things people want, like televisions and computers, are cheaper but the things people need are  more expensive, like fruit, vegetables and petrol.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 What politicians - who are constantly telling people that they have never had it so bad before - what you ignore is  that wages have gone up, taxes are down and welfare benefits, in a lot of cases, are up as well.  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 I don’t accept that taxes are down. This is the first time in eight years that there will be no income tax cut for  everyday Australians.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 But retrospectively over the last five years they have come down.  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 They have come down because we put in place a system of tax cuts system of tax cuts that delivers real benefits  to everyday Australians. We did it because we could run Budget surpluses.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 That is why in cost of living the pressure has gone off not the other way around.  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 I don’t accept that. From my perspective, speaking to every day Australians, they do not understand why  everyone tells them life is so good - the government tells them life is so good - yet they are facing higher costs in  their everyday life. It is the paradox of modern politics that the economists say things are great and we have the  best terms of trade ever, but for everyday Australians life is harder. It shows the government is out of touch  because they don't understand it. They believe the economists. What we are doing is listening to the people.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 Let us have a look at some of the initiatives announced. Set-top boxes, we will take that as a no, you wouldn’t  support it?  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 I want to see the context of it. I don't know if there is a warehouse full of all these set top boxes for people. I don't  know. What I do know is that in the days before the Budget, they are announcing another $300 million.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 Alright, teenage mums, the initiative there to get them back into school or back into the work force.  

 JOE HOCKEY:  

 It is good to get people into the work force provided there is a right support network. There is no use putting the  pressure on teenage mums, in a pilot program, I might add, if they can't get childcare.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 They are saying they will provide the childcare, at least under the pilot program.  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 But I understand the childcare they are referring to is under an existing scheme. Again, we will look at it.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY:  

 That is a maybe. What about this payment of $10,000 for families with teenage kids to get them through to year  12? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Again, I am curious as to why the government is proceeding with this and handing out so much money at this  point of time. It is an extraordinary way to ease the pressure on families. Even more so I am not convinced that  giving money to parents is going to prevent a child going off and becoming a plumber or an electrician and  leaving school early.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 So that is a don’t know or a maybe?  

 JOE HOCKEY:  

 We don’t know the details. Every time we are asked about these sorts of issues we find out, when we get into the  detail that it is a very different initiative.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 

 Every time you are asked about these, you never get a yes.  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 You will see a yes or no in Parliament.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 Alright. What about the fringe benefit things for people who are lucky enough to have a car as part of their  employment? The changes that are proposing there. 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 I don’t accept lucky enough, mate. I just don’t. For a tradie, for a sparkie, for people that are on building sites, for  a whole lot of Australians, their car is their business. I suspect this is going to make their motor vehicles a whole  lot more expensive. We want to see the details on that. If you live outside of Melbourne in Geelong and you drive  to Melbourne for work, your car is your business and your livelihood. This idea of making it more expensive  through higher taxes seems to me a little bit rich.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 Just finally on the banks, the inquiry concluded this week and recommended a review of the banking system, they  want to see a break-up of the dominance of the four banks. Do you support that?  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 I have warned that exit fees will affect non-bank players and that has been reflected in the Senate inquiry  outcomes. Wayne Swan needs to listen to the Senators that have done the hard work that he never did and look 

 at how smaller players are not going to be disadvantaged by the cumbersome policy of the government on exit  fees.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 This was called when the banks raised the home loan rates by more than the Reserve Bank’s cash rate, and  there was hell to pay from politicians on both sides. Yet the inquiry now found the banks acted in response to  higher funding costs. That's embarrassing for politicians everywhere.  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 No, not at all, because I don’t accept that the banks didn't have capacity to cut slack to their customers. When  some of the banks went much higher than other banks, it reflected the fact that some were listening to their  customers and others weren't.  

 BARRIE CASSIDY: 

 Alright, thanks for your time this morning.  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Thanks Barrie.
