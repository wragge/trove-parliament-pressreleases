 HAINES SLAMS HOWARD'S "CYNICAL"MOVE ON IMMIGRATION DEBATE.

 Senator Janine Haines, Leader of the Australian Democrats, today-  slammed John Howard and the Opposition for distorting the  immigration debate in Australia.

 "This is no more than a cynical attempt on John Howard's part  to capture the "bigot" vote Senator Haines said.

 "What on earth do they mean by "one Australia" and which  Australian culture do they think we should be committed to."

 "Do they mean pre World War II culture or the multiculturalism  of the 1980s? Are they suggesting that we get rid of all  Italian restaurants, all Greek festivals and return all Asian  refugees to their countries of origin? "

 "I can only say that the Opposition's approach on immigration  sits very uncomfortably with their approach to foreign investment."

 "They seem to be quite willing to sell Australia to foreign  owners but quite unwilling to let people with skills come to  Australia. "

 "It is extremely regrettable that the Opposition has introduced  this unpleasant element into the debate on immigration" Senator  Haines concluded.
