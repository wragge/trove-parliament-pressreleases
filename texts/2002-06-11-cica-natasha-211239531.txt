 EDUCATION AND CIVICS

 ‘Uppity Wogs -

 A Conversation about Disenfranchisement and Formal Equality’   (abridged version)

 Padma Raman and Natasha Cicaâ

 Address to Women’s Constitutional Convention Canberra, 12 June 2002

 PR: Our presentation today addresses an issue which we’ve talked about, off and on, as friends, privately, for a few years now.

 NC: More correctly, it’s an issue we’ve talked about how best to talk about in public. It’s an important issue, and we are both people for whom public statements and activity are important and in many ways defining.

 PR: While this conversation between ourselves has not been difficult (in fact entirely the opposite), dealing with the issue itself has been more than difficult.  So … what is this mystery issue?

 NC: I’ll start answering that question by telling a story.

 Something I’ve been doing in my spare time recently is being one of the moderators of a public online discussion forum called ‘ALP Review’, a forum for debating many of the themes and questions likely to be canvassed by the Hawke-Wran review of the ALP.

 Early in my time as moderator I raised my long-held concern that current ALP culture ‘is actively hostile to true diversity - of opinion, of influence, and of participatory membership.’  I did this in the context of inviting list members to comment on how they thought race, class and other variables (including gender, of course) did, or should, intersect to shape policy content and processes.  And also in the context of explaining that recently I had been unable to renew my ALP membership because of its (continuing) position on asylum seekers.

 This was one of the responses, from a woman in Western Australia:

 It would be nice if we could have an honest discussion on the issue of multiculturalism/diversity without being accused of racism or xenophobia every time we express some misgiving about it. I have no problems at all with a multiracial society, having a number of people of other races in my own family, but there are some cultures which do not embrace our liberal egalitarian democratic ideals and I do not see why they must be considered as having equal value to our own. As a feminist I have particular objections to any culture that treats women as second class citizens. We fought long and hard for equal rights in this country and I am not about to backtrack in that department. This, I believe, lies at the heart of the concerns about large-scale immigration from the Mid-East - the objections were cultural not racial.

 Diversity is fine and to be welcomed - to a point. When it starts to affect national cohesion  then it must be called into question. A number of books … have addressed recent migration to the USA and have found that immigrants of the past decade or so are not seeing themselves as Americans first but rather, they retain their original identity. They are not integrating into American society. That is exactly what will happen here if multiculturalism is taken to the extreme.  We will lose our cohesion as a nation.

 I have many points of disagreement with Pauline Hanson but she understood the fears in ordinary Australians about this potential loss of national identity/unity/cohesion. Should the ALP dismiss these fears by calling it racism or xenophobia, it will simply extend its time in the political wilderness at national level.

 When I read this email (and a few others like it) I felt sick. And angry. And depressed. And  - worst of all for me - completely unable to respond.  I wrapped up this unhappy, unhealthy bag of emotions, turned off my computer and started to ponder a way forwards.

 After a while I worked out that what upset me most about this message was the yawning gulf between how this woman understood multiculturalism and race issues in Australia, and how I understood them.  Yet, like me, a she was a self-proclaimed feminist.  And like me, she was apparently genuinely interested in advancing what is often called a ‘progressive’ social and political agenda.

 Clearly, at some level she viewed people with a cultural background ‘like mine’ as a potential if not actual threat to Australia’s national cohesion, and indeed identity. (For the record, it’s partly Serbian, almost as dangerous as Indian these days, isn’t that right Padma?)

 (PM: Yes!)

 NC:  Clearly, there would be ‘a point’ where my public statements about race issues would be seen to have ‘gone too far’ and in need of being reined in.   Clearly, if I said what I really thought about her take on race issues, she would see me as somehow un-Australian, or less Australian, or somehow ‘other’.  Accusing her of racism, of xenophobia, or even ‘cultural chauvinism’ clearly would get me nowhere.

 Clearly, she viewed people with a cultural background ‘like hers’ as having a more legitimate claim to be players in shaping Australian identity, and a more legitimate claim to be directors of the agenda and content of public discussions about race.

 Clearly, somewhere, and for some time, something had gone horribly wrong in public debate and education in Australia on race issues.

 Clearly, I needed Padma’s help to make some theoretical and political sense of all this.

 PR:

 Formal equality through enfranchisement and citizenship masks substantive, and persisting, inequality and racism in Australia.

 The project of citizenship, as currently practised and widely understood in Australia, is largely about erasing difference.  It is about universalising the experiences of the dominant racial and cultural groups within society.   In the process the experiences of the so-called ‘other’ are marginalised, silenced and rendered invisible.

 Those experiences are also rendered - literally - rootless and groundless.

 As Australian legal scholar Margaret Thornton points out, ‘[w]ithin legal discourse, ‘the citizen’ is not only an individual who is de-sexed, de-raced and de-classed but he or she is also de-historicised. The one characteristic of identity that the juridical concept of citizenship purports not to suppress is that of nationality. Citizenship is therefore grounded in a very distinctive way. It signals homogeneity and a sense of belonging but the community to which the citizen belongs is exclusively determined in relation to the nation state’.

 ‘Historicizing Citizenship: Remembering Broken Promises’ (1996) MULR 1072.

 The Australian project of citizenship then is essentially, and increasingly, nationalistic. Citizenship is predominantly about policing our borders.  Those borders are national, psychological and cultural.

 Being ‘let in’ - physically or legally - to the Australia polity does not mean that we automatically ‘become Australian.’  We only ‘become Australian’ when we can and do

 reflect back to wider Australian society an acceptable image  - one which fits and sits comfortably with the universalised experiences, and interests, of the dominant racial and cultural group (i.e. Anglo/Celts).  In other words, when we convincingly assimilate.

 Our Australianness is questioned when we send back to that group a different image, one that that is more true to our lived experience as so-called ‘other’.  We will be punished, and disenfranchised, to the extent that we deviate too often or too much from the acceptable image.  Along the way, we are likely to internalise mainstream society’s fundamental contempt for our own so-called ‘otherness’.

 In the words of gay black American novelist James Baldwin:

 It is a peculiar triumph of society- and its loss- that it is able to convince those people to whom it has given inferior status the reality of that decree; it has the force and the weapons to translate its dictum into fact, so that the allegedly inferior are actually made so, in so far as the social realities are concerned. This is a more hidden phenomena than it was in the days of serfdom, but it is no less implacable. Now, as then, we find ourselves bound, fist without, then within, by the nature of our categorisation. And escape is not effected through a bitter railing against this trap; it is though this very striving were the only motion needed to spring that trap onto us. We take our shape, it is true, within and against that cage of reality bequeathed us at our birth; and yet it is precisely through our dependence on this reality that we are most endlessly betrayed.

 Everybody’s Protest Novel (1949)

 NC: That’s not very optimistic, Padma.

 PR: Well - no and yes. It does take us forward, because it points by contrast to a better way of approaching citizenship and substantive equality.

 That better way should draw upon the hard-learned lessons of feminism.  The best theory and politics of feminism has been about fighting against women being defined as the lesser, invisible, silenced ‘other’, in relation to men.

 That better way should also draw upon the many and varied struggles against social and economic marginalisation according to class.  The best theory and politics of class struggle has been about fighting against people being defined as lesser, invisible, silenced ‘other’, because of the situation of their birth, wealth and/or education.

 But that better way must also fully embrace and be grounded in the racial and cultural diversity of our society. Not just for reasons of ideological comfort or consistency. There’s a strong practical imperative too - Australia is in fact already a national community comprised substantially, not marginally, of immigrants and their children.  So if our theory and practice of citizenship does not fully embrace all these people - and also if it is not open to embracing more so-called ‘others’ like us - we are doomed to be a place and a people internally divided and perpetually unequal. Because we so-called ‘others’ are here to stay.  Like it or not.

 NC: And that’s where better leadership comes in.

 Australian leaders might choose to keep using citizenship as a tool to reinforce our borders, to draw the circle of ‘us’ ever tighter and meaner, and paint the spectre of ‘them’ as ever more threatening.

 Or, they might choose to start the process of better civics education - of our children, and of the wider community.

 At a minimum, that education must be informed by, and inform about:

 â¢ A better understanding of the history of this place and its communities, grounded in a better understanding of the dispossession of Australia’s indigenous peoples, and which better embraces the evolving history of their relationship with later human arrivals;

 â¢ A deeper understanding of the evolving complexities, allegiances and animosities within the NESB communities in Australia, including around issues of multiculturalism; and

 â¢ A continuing awareness of the importance of constructive optimism, and of the fact that in so many ways the ties that bind us remain stronger than the wedges - and factions - that divide us on race issues.

 PR:  And it seems that leadership on this issue won’t come from ‘the top’ just yet.

 So for now it just has to come from the bottom, from the middle, from the side, from wherever.

 From people like you and me.  We all have an obligation to speak out.

 Even if it means we’re ‘uppity wogs.’
