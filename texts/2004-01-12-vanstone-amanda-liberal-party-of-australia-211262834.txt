 Senator Amanda Vanstone  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 

 More Migrants Settle in Regional NSW

 VPS 018/2004

 From Wollongong to Lismore and Coffs Harbour to Narrabri - more and more migrants are choosing to settle and remain in  regional New South Wales. 

 But we need to do more and the initiatives I announced today with the Acting Prime Minister, John Anderson, will help to  attract more migrants and refugees to Australia's regional areas. 

 At the last Census, some 41,618 people living in Wollongong were born overseas. Of those, a majority was born in England  and Macedonia. 

 In Lismore, some 3,324 people were born overseas. Of those, a majority was born in England and New Zealand. 

 Some 6,579 people living in Coffs Harbour were born overseas, of whom the majority was from England and New Zealand. 

 Some 543 people living in Narrabri were born overseas. Again England and New Zealand topped the list. 

 In 2002-03, some 620 visas were granted to people under State-specific and regional migration initiatives for New South  Wales. 

 This is an increase of approximately 171 percent over the 2001-02 financial year. 

 Since 1997-98 some 1,870 visas have been granted to people planning to settle in New South Wales under various programs. 

 Visa grants for regional areas are steadily increasing, but more can be done to assist regional Australia to get the people they  want and this is what the measures being announced today aim to do. 

 From 1 July, qualified people who want to come to Australia as skilled migrants will be able to obtain a three-year temporary  residence visa if they commit to living and working in regional Australia. After two years they will be able to apply for  permanent residency. 

 There is also a new visa for self-funded retirees to encourage them to settle in regional areas. 

 Under this visa, participating state and territory governments will be able to sponsor self-funded retirees settling in regional  Australia. 

 Self-funded retirees provide an opportunity for Australia to benefit both from their capital investment and the money they  spend while in Australia.
