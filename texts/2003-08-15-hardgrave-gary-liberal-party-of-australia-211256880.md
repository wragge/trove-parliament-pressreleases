 Gary Hardgrave MP   Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs 

   Media Release H110/2003 - 15 August 2003

 

 New Settlement Services for Footscray

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, today launched new  settlement service arrangements for migrants in the Western region of Melbourne. 

 Attending the opening of the new office at Footscray, Mr Hardgrave said the western  suburbs of Melbourne was an area which attracted high numbers of new migrants.

 The new Adult Multicultural Education Service (AMES) initiative, known as Footscray  Settlement Services, is part of a range of services that will replace the Inner Western Region  Migrant Resource Centre, which closed recently. 

 Mr Hardgrave said funding of $552,427 would ensure the overall level of funding to region  would be maintained. 

 'AMES has played an important role over many years in delivering educational programs to  recently arrived migrants and refugees. This gives Footscray Settlement Services a solid  foundation from which to deliver a range of important services,' Mr Hardgrave said. 

 Mr Hardgrave said that the recently released 'Report of the Review of Settlement Services  for Migrants and Humanitarian Entrants' encouraged more innovative and flexible service  delivery arrangements to help migrants make a smooth transition into Australian society.

 Apart from providing general settlement services, staff will be able to facilitate contact with  other key mainstream service providers in the areas of health, employment, education and  housing. Footscray Settlement Services is staffed by a team leader and three case workers,  all of whom bring valuable experience to this new service. 'I am confident these initiatives  will increase significantly settlement service outcomes for the western suburbs of  Melbourne,' Mr Hardgrave said. 

 'A reference group for Footscray Settlement Services will review and monitor the services  provided to ensure that any gaps are addressed effectively,' Mr Hardgrave said.

 Mr Hardgrave acknowledged the important additional role to be played by the Horn of Africa  Communities Network, North West MRC, Westgate MRC, South Central MRC and  Maribyrnong City Council in providing additional settlement services following the closure of  the Inner Western Region Migrant Resource Centre.

 'These arrangements will be for a 12 month period ending 30 June 2004 and will be  monitored closely to ensure that settlement needs continue to be met,' he said.
