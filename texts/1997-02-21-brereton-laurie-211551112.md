  Today is a very timely opportunity to review where Australia stands in tlie field 

  of foreign policy. It is nearly a year since the change of Government in 

  Canberra and in the next couple of months the Howard Government will release 

  two major foreign policy documents - the Simons Review of our overseas aid 

  programs and a White Paper on foreign and trade policy. In Opposition, Labor 

  has commenced its own process of foreign policy review. Indeed in Melbourne 

  yesterday I attended the first meeting of the Party's National Security and Trade 

  Policy Committee which will conduct a comprehensive review of Labor's 

  approach to foreign policy, trade policy and defence policy in the run up to next 

  January's national conference. Against this background, now is an excellent 

  time to address how Australia has been travelling in international affairs, to take 

  stock and to see where we might be going. 

  So where do we stand? In fairness to the Government, it can be said at the 

  outset that they have had a hard act to follow on the international stage. Foreign 

  affairs was widely recognised at home and certainly abroad as one of the main 

  policy strengths of the Hawke and Keating Labor Governments. 

  Labor held office for thirteen years through a period of quite extraordinary 

  change - globally, with the end of the Cold War, and here in our own region, 

  with the rise of East Asia as the most dynamic economic region in the world. 

  We held office, moreover, at a time when the globalisation of markets and the 

  revolutions in communications and information technology were fundamentally 

  changing the way in which governments, businesses and peoples around the 

  world relate to each other. 

  .. . 

  In response to these challenges we conducted an activist foreign policy, 

  confident in Australia's capacity as a middle power with a strong Asia-Pacific 

  3 

  focus to firstly advance our national interests and secondly contribute towards 

  the development of a more cooperative and just international order. We were 

  realistic about the limits of Australi a's influence but determined to maximise our 

  opportunities at all levels - global, regional and bilateral - and we did so, I think, 

  with some flair and panache. 

  In the Asia-Pacific region, the primary but certainly not exclusive focus of our 

  diplomatic efforts, we took a lead in the establishment of APEC and in driving 

  forward the process of regional trade liberalisation and growing political 

  cooperation and dialogue. Recognising that Australia must seek security in Asia 

  rather than from Asia, we played a key role in the negotiation of the Cambodian 

  peace settlement and strongly supported the development of the ASEAN 

  regional security forum. We worked hard to develop strong defence links with 

  neighbours like Singapore and Malaysia, as well as new partnerships with 

  countries like the Philippines and Vietnam. To the same end we concluded the 

  Australia-Indonesia Agreement on Maintaining Security, a serious and 

  important step for both Australia and Indonesia which demonstrated the 

  confidence each country has in the other and the fundamental commitment of 

  both to a cooperative and peaceful relationship. 

  Labor's diplomacy was not confined to our region. On the contrary we were 

  globally active in our pursuit of Australia's economic and security interests. In 

  international trade we were instrumental in the formation of the Cairns Group, a 

  remarkably diverse coalition of countries, and the successful conclusion of the 

  Uruguay Round. We played a leading role in the.'field of disarmament and non­

  proliferation; in particular establishing the South Pacific nuclear weapon free 

  zone; negotiating the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive 

  Test Ban Treaty; achieving indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-

  4 

  Proliferation Treaty; and establishing the Canberra Commission on the 

  Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. The report of the Commission has been 

  widely applauded for its key contribution to debate on future directions m 

  nuclear arms control and disarmament in this post Cold War world. 

  Labor also recognised and embraced the new internationalist agenda of issues of 

  environmental degradation and the management of global commons, the plight 

  of refugees, narcotics and terrorism; issues which had been largely regarded as 

  far outside the mainstream of diplomacy, but which are now seen as requiring 

  international cooperation if they are to be successfully tackled in an increasingly 

  interdependent world. As a consequence, for example, we played a central role 

  in the negotiation of the Madrid Protocol on Environment Protection in the 

  Antarctic. 

  In the broadest sense in Government, Labor was committed to "win a future for 

  Australia in the world". We were unapologetically nationalist and 

  internationalist, committed to building new economic and security structures on 

  the global, the regional and the bilateral levels; to finding new ways to protect 

  and advance our basic national interests, and in doing so make our world a better 

  and safer place. 

  Under Labor, Australia was a country which consistently punched above its 

  weight in international affairs. We were a country which in both our region and 

  beyond was widely seen not only to have much to contribute to the common 

  good, but which also had the political energy; diplomatic resources, and 

  determination to do so . 

  5 

  In contrast to this legacy of achievement in international affairs we now have 

  the experience of the first eleven months of the Howard Government. 

  In Opposition, of course, the Coalition attacked Labor for being too 

  preoccupied, indeed obsessed, with Asia to the cost of our relations with Europe. 

  But as soon at they took office, they rushed off to Asia to tell everyone that 

  nothing had changed, that they were just as committed to engagement with our 

  region as Labor. At the beginning, in the honeymoon period when it was all 

  smiles and polite words, they got a pretty good press for their efforts. Largely 

  on the basis of his airport transit lounge liaison with Prime Minister Mahathir, 

  Alexander Downer was lauded as a statesman in the making. Since those early 

  days, however, things haven't gone well. For Mr Downer in particular you 

  could say they've gone from bad to worse. 

  Some of the foreign policy 'highlights' of the past eleven months have included: 

  The fiasco involving the axmg of the Development Import Finance 

  Facility ( DIFF) program. 

  One might have thought that Mr Downer would have at least 

  heeded the maxim he once expounded as Shadow Minister for 

  Foreign Affairs- "lying for domestic political gain is one thing, but 

  to lie internationally is downright ' damaging" - but that's exactly 

  what he did. 

  The DIFF debacle unquestionably dealt a fatal blow to the regional 

  standing and credibility of the Foreign Minister leaving him 

  indelibly tarnished in the eyes of our Asian neighbours. 

  .. 

  6 

  The 10 per cent cut to our overseas aid programs. 

  The unnecessary tension and conflict in our relations with China. 

  Prime Minister Howard's abysmal failure of leadership in last year's 

  controversy over Asian immigration - a failure not just here at home, but a 

  failure widely noted and commented on throughout our region. 

  The shocking failure of Australia's campaign for a seat on the United 

  Nations Security Council. 

  The final critical phase of that campaign was led, of course, by Mr 

  Downer who lobbied more than one hundred of his counterparts in 

  New York, including more than fifty one-on-one meetings, but had 

  absolutely no idea of the collapse of our support in the weeks prior 

  to the vote. 

  The breakdown of negotiations for the Australia - European Union 

  framework agreement - a high priority for a government committed to 

  further develop our relations with Europe - and over what - an utterly 

  unobjectionable clause on human rights! 

  The preparedness the Government to contemplate the demise of Radio 

  Australia and Australia Television with little regard to the consequences 

  for our standing and influence in the Asia: Pacific region. 

  and, just in the past week, the reaffirmation of Malaysia's veto over 

  Australian participation in the Asia - Europe summit meeting (ASEM) 

  process in spite ofMr Downer's supposedly 'highly successful' cultivation 

  of Prime Minister Mahathir. 

  7 

  The Howard Government declared participation in the ASEM process to 

  be one of its top priorities, yet we now face the real possibility of Burma, 

  Laos and Cambodia, even India, as full-fledged members while Australia 

  remains excluded. 

  It is not unreasonable to ask, I think, just how much more of Alexander 

  Downer's definition of international success can Australia afford? 

  Aside from the basic issue of competence, or more accurately incompetence, we 

  have also seen the clear reluctance of the Howard Government to embrace 

  significant elements of the Keating Government's approach to international 

  affairs. The DIFF shambles, the Hanson immigration debate, Mr Howard's very 

  pedestrian performance on his two visits to Asia, the axe poised above Radio 

  Australia and Australia Television, and a noticeable shift in rhetoric about 

  Australia's place in the world and our region, leave a heavy cloud of doubt and 

  suspicion over Australia's commitment to wholehearted engagement with Asia. 

  This is a very serious failure, unquestionably the most profound foreign policy 

  failure of the Government to date. We are all well aware that Mr Howard and 

  Mr Downer repeatedly proclaim the importance of engagement with Asia. First 

  impressions, however, are more often than not the ones that count, and in the 

  past eleven months the Government has managed to send so many wrong 

  signals to our region. From Asian capitals, the view of the Coalition's foreign 

  policy performance is pretty dismal and there's precious little confidence that 

  things are about to get better. Rather than "A Confident Australia", the title of 

  the Coalition's foreign policy platform, the impression the Howard Government 

  has conveyed to our Asian neighbours is that of a confused Australia. Given the 

  pattern that has emerged, one must question the Government's level of 

  8 

  commitment and ask precisely what, if any, strategy is behind its approach to 

  our region? Perhaps worst of all, there seems to be little awareness of the 

  magnitude of the task the Government now faces in putting things back on track. 

  The other major failure has been in the field of human rights. As Shadow 

  Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer spoke at length and with some passion 

  about his commitment to advance the cause ofhuman rights. In his first speech 

  as Shadow Minister he argued forcefully that the most important feature of any 

  human rights policy is consistency: "We cannot simply speak with a loud voice 

  when injustice occurs on the other side of the world, whilst whispering softly or 

  remaining silent when similar events take place within own region. Base 

  convenience must not be the lodestar which determines our activism." 

  Whatever criticism might be levelled against Labor's consistency on human 

  rights issues, base convenience is precisely the standard which has emerged as 

  the Coalition's benchmark these past eleven months. The issue of human rights, 

  including labor standards and child labour exploitation, has been very 

  significantly downgraded in our foreign policy priorities with the Howard 

  Government withdrawing from active participation in the International Labour 

  Organisation and openly arguing for a "softly, softly" human rights approach 

  designed to give no offence to authoritarian regimes in our region. 

  Deputy Prime Minister Fischer set the tone, of course, by acting as an apologist 

  for China's gross human rights abuses in Tibet,' declaring for good measure that 

  all he was concerned about was "trade, trade, trade". Nowhere is the banlauptcy 

  of the Government's human rights rhetoric more' evident, however, than in the 

  case of Burma. Last December, in response to the further deterioration of the 

  human rights in Burma, I called on behalf of the Labour Opposition for the 

  Howard Government to impose economic and other sanctions on Burma's State 

  9 

  Law and Order Restoration Council. The Foreign Minister's response- to the 

  SLORC' s renewed crackdown on the Burmese democracy movement has 

  amounted to nothing more than the expression of increasingly feeble platitudes. 

  Indeed Mr Downer has openly admitted that the Government's policy toward 

  Burma is totally ineffective, but he offers no alternative. He merely shrugs his 

  shoulders and says he can do no more. So much for any claims to consistency 

  or leadership on human rights. 

  So what next? What needs to be done to put things right? First, a modest 

  diplomatic post should be found without delay for Alexander Downer. I don't 

  say this lightly, after all Mr Downer is good for me - he's a shadow minister's 

  dream! But we must consider the national interest and the bald fact is that 

  Alexander rates a zero on the credibility meter. Sadly for someone who for so 

  long coveted the foreign affairs portfolio, he hasn't cut the mustard. The most 

  anyone can now expect from him is that he will continue to eke out his 

  ministerial existence until the Prime Minister eventually decides to reshuffle his 

  Cabinet. But further delay is something we can ill afford. No responsible Prime 

  Minister can afford to leave our national interests in the hands of a foreign 

  minister whose standing at horne and abroad has been so badly and irrevocably 

  damaged. 

  Another reason for Mr Downer's early departure is the forthcoming release of 

  the Government's foreign and trade policy Whlte Paper. Foreshadowed by the 

  Coalition prior to last year's election, the White Paper has the potential to make 

  a useful contribution to debate on the future course of Australia's international 

  policies. I hope that it will do so. The simple fact, however, is that an 

  Alexander Downer White Paper will be severely handicapped and many people, 

  particularly in our region, will write down its significance before they have even 

  10 

  glanced at its content. If Prime Minister Howard is senous about such an 

  exercise he ought to ensure that a more credible figure is in place as foreign 

  minister when the White Paper is tabled in Parliament next April. 

  The Labor Opposition will judge the substance of the White Paper on its merits. 

  According to the Government statement when it was commissioned in August 

  last year, its aim is to identify Australia's national interests, examine the 

  international environment in which Australia will in the future pursue those 

  interests and recommend appropriate strategies for their advancement. One of 

  the challenges to be faced in this review will be to accurately forecast the likely 

  international trends and developments into the first two decades of the next 

  century. It's a tall order. Some long term trends such as the rise of East Asia 

  and the increasing globalisation of markets are already widely recognised. At 

  the same time, however, diplomacy is a fast moving business subject to great 

  uncertainty- the future of Hong Kong and the role of China in the Asia-Pacific 

  region are only two inter-connected issues of great importance and the subject of 

  very lively debate. Assessments and predictions made one year can easily look 

  very dodgy come the next, and policy recommendations beyond the most banal 

  and obvious can all too quickly be consigned to the dust-bin of history. 

  One way to reduce these difficulties would be to ensure the widest range of 

  inputs into the review process. Unfortunately, Mr Downer's approach has been 

  to rely almost exclusively on the Foreign Affairs and Trade bureaucracy and an 

  advisory panel largely drawn from a narrow range of conservative business and 

  academic opinion; opinion more likely than not fo· define our national interests 

  in traditional and narrow terms. The advisory panel has held all of its meetings 

  in private with no opportunity for public participation or input.. 

  11 

  It remains to be seen whether this behind closed doors process will come to 

  grips effectively with the very diverse challenges Australia is likely to face next 

  century. It is particularly doubtful whether it will give proper consideration to 

  non-strategic and non-economic interests such as the promotion of universal 

  human rights. Whatever the final outcome, it is a matter of regret that the 

  Government has not made provision for a more democratic process with 

  contributions from a much wider range of community opinion. By contrast, the 

  development of Ireland's 1996 foreign policy White Paper involved submissions 

  from a large number of non-government organisations and a series of well­

  attended public seminars on a diverse range of foreign policy issues. That 

  process could have provided a useful model for Australia, but such an inclusive, 

  participatory approach apparently found no favour with Mr Downer. 

  Ultimately Australia's approach to international affairs must reflect our national 

  character and the aspirations of ordinary Australians. The exclusive process 

  adopted by the Government in the preparation of the White Paper is hardly 

  likely to contribute to a sense of ownership of foreign policy by the Australian 

  people. A real sense of ownership of foreign policy is essential to underpin a 

  domestically sustainable approach to the challenges ahead; challenges which 

  include the increasing globalisation of markets and the rapidly accelerating 

  internationalisation of Australia's economy and society. The Coalition could 

  have learned this from Labor's experience. Certainly it is something I have 

  taken to heart and which should characterise the development of Labor's future 

  approach to foreign affairs. 

  . .. 

  Such things said, the White Paper should still allow the Howard Government to 

  put its best foot forward in foreign policy. It should provide a real opportunity 

  for the Government to make a clear statement of its approach to international 

  12 ·. 

  ' 

  affairs and to re sol ve some of the uncertainty and doubt that has clouded its 

  early stewardship of Australia's foreign policy. Above all the White Paper 

  should proclaim an unequivocal commitment to engagement with Asia - the 

  region where our nation's future lies and where our vital interests - strategic and 

  economic - must be pursued without reservation if we are to enjoy a secure and 

  prosperous future. 

  At the same time the White Paper must reaffirm Australia's involvement on the 

  wider, global diplomatic stage. Here it is not so much the rhetoric of good 

  international citizenship which counts, though that is very important, but our 

  real preparedness to play a global role, a role commensurate with our standing 

  and influence as a middle ranking power whose interests inevitably extend far 

  beyond our region. 

  In this regard I must say that I was concerned, but not surprised, to read in the 

  press earlier this week that Mr Downer is reportedly dissatisfied with the drafts 

  of the White Paper prepared by the bureaucrats in Foreign Affairs and Trade. A 

  self-confessed fan of Henry Kissinger and keen student of nineteen century 

  European diplomacy, Mr Downer is reported to have demanded what he calls an 

  unambiguously "realist" foreign policy framework with bilateral and regional 

  diplomacy given a very clear priority over multilateral initiatives, and 

  prominence given to the concept of the balance of power. One can understand 

  that Alexander would want to leave some mark before he departs the foreign 

  policy stage. It is also understandable that he should display some lack of 

  enthusiasm for multilateral processes and forums ·after the embarrassment of our 

  Security Council candidature. That said, the crude imposition of an International 

  Politics Grade I concept of power politics and a downgrading of our multilateral 

  13 

  commitments IS unlikely to Impress our friends and neighbours or serve 

  Australia's national interests. 

  The fact is that Australia must be active in pursuing our national interests at all 

  levels and in all appropriate forums. Our diplomacy is not a zero sum game in 

  which multilateral initiatives and good international citizenship in the broadest 

  sense can only be pursued at the cost of bilateral or regional commitments or 

  vice versa. Good bilateral and regional relationships underpin our multilateral 

  initiatives. At the same time our efforts in the United Nations and other global 

  forums can and do contribute directly to our bilateral and regional objectives. In 

  the field of disarmament and non-proliferation, for example, Australia's 

  contributions to the multilateral negotiation of the Chemical Weapons 

  Convention and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty were nowhere more valued 

  than in the United States. Similarly our active involvement in multilateral 

  disarmament and non-proliferation negotiations and processes has been a key 

  element in our contributions to the establishment and development of the 

  ASEAN regional forum. Multilateral, regional and bilateral diplomacy are 

  inextricably entwined. 

  Mr Downer's concept of "realism", of crude power politics with a marginal role 

  for cooperative multilateral solutions, is naive at best and a plainly inadequate 

  basis for sophisticated diplomacy as we move into the twenty-first century. It is 

  a recipe not to maximise, but to minimise Australia's influence; and not only 

  globally but regionally and in our bilateral relationships as well. Not for the first 

  time, the Coalition and Mr Downer in particular ' appears to be falling into the 

  trap of trying to be different for the sake of it. Alternatively, aware of his 

  incapacity to defend his portfolio from a another round of savage budget cuts, 

  the Foreign Minister may be simply scratching about for a formula to justify a 

  14 

  further contraction of Australia's diplomatic efforts. Either way it isn' t creative. 

  It ' s just plain dumb. 

  It will be interesting to watch the response of the United States to Mr Downer' s 

  so-called "realism". In his farewell speech last month, Secretary of State 

  Warren Christopher highlighted what he saw as the principle foreign policy 

  legacy of the Clinton Presidency, namely the high priority given by the 

  Administration to addressing emerging global issues · like the proliferation of 

  weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, international crime, drug trafficking and 

  damage to the environment. Such transnational issues cannot be adequately 

  addressed by traditional country-to-country diplomacy, or even on a regional 

  basis. As Secretary Christopher said: "Global problems require global 

  solutions." 

  Recognition of that fact saw the Clinton Administration appoint an Under 

  Secretary of State for Global Affairs in 1993. Secretary of State Madeleine 

  Albright recently reaffirmed the Administration's commitment to continue the 

  integration of global issues, in particular environmental issues, into the 

  mainstream of United States diplomacy. She is absolutely right to do so. The 

  threats of global warming, pollution, deforestation and loss of biodiversity may 

  not be as dramatic as those posed by nuclear proliferation or terrorism, but 

  countries such as Australia and the United States will surely pay the price in 

  terms of lost jobs and deterioration of our qualitY of life if they are not addressed 

  with determination and vigour. Here Australia cannot be a free rider in any 

  sense. We must be fully engaged in the development of new solutions to global 

  problems. If we are not, global solutions will in any case be worked out without 

  us and very probably at our cost instead of to our benefit. This is not a time to 

  15 

  be pulling back from the wider world. On the contrary our national interests 

  demand our wholehearted participation on the global stage. 

  As I said earlier Labor will judge the Government's White Paper on its merits, 

  but I can't say I'm very optimistic. At the end of the day I suspect it will largely 

  be a domestic political exercise, limited to banalities, using words such as 

  "realism" and "finite resources" allow a further contraction of our foreign policy 

  objectives and diplomacy. It will amount I fear to what one commentator has 

  rightly called the Coalition's "Little Australia" policy in international affairs -the approach of an opinion poll driven government with few international 

  ambitions and even less will or ability to pursue those ambitions. Instead of 

  punching above our weight, Australia is now sadly sliding into the bantam­

  weight class in international affairs. The Howard Government seems 

  determined to do less with less. In doing so they will sell Australia short.
