 Media release   

 Christine Milne  Australian Greens Senator for Tasmania 

 International day of Action on Climate Change  Senator  Milne          3rd  December  2005  

 Message from Montreal  Australian Greens Senator Christine Milne  

 

 Congratulations for turning out today to Walk Against Warming. You are being joined by  thousands of people from right around the world, from Romania, the UK, France, Italy,  the United States and Canada to name a few, as people everywhere stand up for the  climate. Ten thousand people have arrived here for the talks and I will take your voices  raised today right into the heart of the meetings here in Montreal. 

 There are moments in the history of the world that really matter; moments that set in train  events from which there can be no going back, moments that determine the future of life  on Earth as we know it and the first meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol here in  Montreal is one such moment.  

 Climate Change is the greatest threat to global security facing us all. The world's climate  is already changing with permafrost melting, wild storms and hurricanes ravaging our  coasts, sea levels rising, droughts and fires intensifying, the ice caps retreating and people  having to leave their homes as environmental refugees. 

 Our children and grandchildren can expect to grow up in a world without polar bears, or  pygmy possums unless drastic action is taken now.  

 In Montreal people are speculating about what role Australia will play. Australia and the  United States of America must not be allowed to frustrate or stall global action on  mitigation and adaptation to climate change. 

 Send a strong message to Prime Minister Howard that the people of Australia want to be  responsible global citizens; We want to take radical action to save the world's climate;  We want to ratify the Kyoto Protocol; We want to commit to strong reduction targets for  the 2013- 2017 period; We want huge investment in renewable energy and energy  efficiency; 

 Tell Prime Minister Howard that we think climate change is so serious that we do not  want to put off until tomorrow what we can do today; 

 Say 'Yes' to Renewables and 'No' to Nuclear Now! 

 Tell the Prime Minister that we are ashamed of Australia's current role as a spoiler and  that we will not tolerate Australia playing the Deputy Sheriff role to George Bush in  Montreal.
