 Laurie Ferguson MP  Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services 

 Jewish Australians celebrate Rosh Hashanah 

 Monday 29 September 2008 

 At the blowing of the ram’s horn or shofar tomorrow, Australia’s Jewish community  will gather for Rosh Hashanah, marking the creation of all life and the beginning of  the new year. 

 Sending his best wishes, the Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and  Settlement Services, Laurie Ferguson, said for a community who represent less than  1 per cent of the population, the contribution Jewish Australians have made to our  nation has been remarkable.  

 The 2006 Census recorded almost 89 000 people of Jewish faith in Australia, an  increase of almost 6 per cent since the 2001 Census. 

 ‘Judaism came to Australia with the first European settlers and is an important part of  Australia’s heritage,’ Mr Ferguson said. 

 ‘Leading Jewish figures in Australian history have included the first Australian-born  governor-general, Sir Isaac Isaacs, and the commander of Australian troops in the  First World War, Sir John Monash. 

 ‘As well, businessman and philanthropist Sir Sidney Myer arrived in Australia in 1899  as a Russian Jewish refugee with only three-pence to his name.  Originally peddling  door to door, he engineered a retail revolution.  

 ‘There has been much work done by the Jewish community to involve the wider  Australian community in promoting interfaith dialogue and to build a better, fairer and  more compassionate Australia.   

 ‘The Jewish community’s involvement in activities such as the Living in Harmony  program’s Together for Humanity project assists in building greater respect, unity  and understanding between people.   

 ‘This project will involve at least 8 000 students and engages schools and education  communities, including Indigenous Australians and Pacific Islanders.  

 ‘I wish all Australia’s Jewish community a very happy new year,’ Mr Ferguson added
