 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY    EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY

 SPEECH BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THE HON SIMON CREAN MP POPULATION SUMMIT 2002 MELBOURNE

 25 FEBRUARY 2002

 I believe that Australia needs a population policy and that we should develop population targets.

 We need to decide what is the optimum population for Australia and how we get there.

 Population policy is a key tool for creating greater economic prosperity, planning social policies, strengthening the regions and ensuring that we protect the environment.

 It also provides the framework in which our immigration and refugee policies should be understood.

 Developing a population policy will involve widespread public debate but it demands political leadership.

 While much attention was focused on the twelve new faces on my front bench, the modernization of my shadow ministry went much further.

 I used the structure of the front bench to emphasize what I believe should be the policy priorities of a Federal Labor Government.

 One of my decisions was to appoint a Shadow Minister of cabinet rank not just for Immigration, but for Population and Immigration.  I appointed Julia Gillard to the post, with Laurie Ferguson as the Shadow Minister for Multiculturalism.

 Population policy is about more than immigration, but I want to begin with some comments about immigration.

 I believe that immigration has been unambiguously good for Australia.   Good for us economically, good for us socially and good for us culturally.

 I have always supported relatively high levels of immigration and believe that over the long term we should continue to do so.

 But it is obvious to everyone that public support for our immigration program is under strain.

 Good leadership means the development of a comprehensive national population policy that spells out the benefits of immigration to every Australian.

 Currently the Federal Government argues that Australian does not need a formal population policy.  That we already know what our future population levels will be.  They want our population level to be defined by standing back and letting population trends take their course.

 If we take this do-nothing approach it means:

 â¢ Our population will peak at about 25 million in the next 50 years and then decline.

 â¢ The populations of Tasmania, South Australia and our country towns will contract, while those of our major capitals will expand.

 â¢ And the proportion of the population over retirement age will rise dramatically.

 Doing nothing gives us precisely the population policy we don’t want: an ageing and declining society concentrated in a limited number of sprawling cities.

 Australia’s thinking must change.

 We must set population targets as part of a comprehensive population policy.

 In the past I have rejected the setting of specific targets because the targets would become the issue.

 While we don’t want the targets to become the only issue, I’m now convinced that to advance the debate we have to talk about targets.

 3

 That’s why I want Australia to develop population targets, but as part of a comprehensive population policy developed after a thorough and informed public debate.

 This conference will, I hope, give a renewed start to that debate.

 ***

 Population growth is critical to the long-term economic health of this nation.

 It directly affects the size of the labour force, the level of economic demand and the level of productivity.

 It is obvious that immigration expands the size of the workforce, but it can also improve its quality.

 Immigration enhances productivity and innovation because it is about the free movement of human capital, knowledge and skills.

 A good population policy will bring more skilled people here, re-skill our existing population and stop the “brain drain” of our talented people overseas.

 We also need to reverse the declining trend in our fertility rate.  Increasing the fertility rate is not about forcing women to stay at home.  It’s about making it easier for those who want to have children to do so, be it through maternity leave, childcare or other policies that support the raising of children.

 Given current birth rates, our ageing population poses significant problems for labor force growth in the medium term.

 This pressure on the growth of our labour force means that growth in productivity must be even greater than otherwise to ensure that our economic growth does not fall.

 One of the reasons why Australia’s economic growth was so high in the 1980s and 1990s was our relatively high level of immigration.

 Critics of immigration often complain that immigrants take jobs, but this is not supported by the facts.

 In the 13 years between 1983 and 1996 1.3 million immigrants -- or about 100,000 per year -- settled in Australia.  At the same time over 2 million jobs were created.  This was one of the fastest rates of job growth in the world, contributing to a big step up in multifactor productivity in the 1990s.

 It was a period of strong immigration and strong jobs growth. But we’ve dropped the ball since then.

 4

 In the four years since 1997, not once has migration exceeded 100,000 per year, and the average intake has been below 85,000 per year.

 The Government has undershot its skilled migration targets by 20 percent.

 Workforce growth, productivity and economic growth will suffer as a result. A strategically developed population policy can mean more jobs and higher incomes by raising demand and productivity levels.

 I want to emphasize, though, that improving the nation’s skill levels through immigration programs has to be developed as part of a broader commitment to skill formation.

 We can’t just rely on immigration.  We must develop the knowledge and skills of all our people.

 ***

 Population policy will also be of particular benefit for the regions.

 Population policy is essential if we are to avoid the twin problem of declining regional communities and sprawling cities.

 The population of Tasmania has now been falling for two years while the population of South Australia is stagnating.

 Our national government cannot sit back and watch as some parts of our federation face long-term economic and social decline while others such as New South Wales, particularly in Sydney, come under pressure due to rapid growth.

 The positives that national and international migration brings - skills, capital and local demand - are the very things that are needed to revive regional communities both socially and economically.

 Every community, whether it is in the city or the country, deserves and demands the attention of the Federal Government in developing to the full their economic and social potential.

 We need to encourage migration to where it can benefit the nation most; we need to re-skill local residents; and we need to give every community access to the modern infrastructure they need to build a successful future for themselves.

 What is needed is a constructive partnership between the states and the Commonwealth to help plan economic and social revival in every community.

 5

 It needs a whole of governments approach through a heads of governments commitment.

 It’s an urgent national priority and a key element of population policy.

 That’s why I challenge the Prime Minister to put the development of a population policy on the agenda of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG).

 All state and territory governments are willing to sign a protocol to advance this agenda.  But it needs the same commitment from the Commonwealth.  I urge the Prime Minister to give it.

 Under my leadership the federal government would work with the states to develop such a policy.

 ***

 People are rightly worried about the impact of higher population levels on the environment.

 I believe, however, that we can have an increased population without damaging the environment if we adopt more sustainable practices.

 That’s why a good population policy must go hand-in-hand with modernizing our economy and making our industries and services more sustainable, not just in economic terms but environmentally as well.

 We must use technology and know-how to reduce the ecological footprint we all make.

 We are already amongst the world leaders in the development of efficient, clean green industries.

 If we can harness this advantage we can support more people while protecting the environment and creating flourishing export industries in areas such as green technologies and environmental management.

 ***

 All of these benefits of population policy rely heavily on one thing - increasing the public’s confidence in the benefits of immigration and multiculturalism.

 Obviously that confidence has been shaken by recent events, including the controversy surrounding asylum seekers.

 Rebuilding that confidence will be a long and difficult process.

 But  rebuild  it  we  must.   It  is  critical  to  our  future  and  our  standing  in  the international community.

 6

 We must review our refugee policies.

 We  can  develop  a  response  that  is  both  tough  on  border  protection  and compassionate, in which we take our fair share of refugees in the context of a broader population policy.

 I fully understand community anger about “queue jumping”, but we must work cooperatively with the international community to tackle the problem of people smuggling and refugee movements at their source.

 Labor is already working on a comprehensive proposal to tackle this issue, but this week the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Coolum provides an immediate opportunity to help develop such a framework.

 Seven countries that have not yet signed the 1967 Protocol on Refugees are members of CHOGM.  They are: Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Burma, Malaysia, Singapore and Bangladesh.

 These non-signatories represent the chain of countries between the Middle East and Australia and are the pipeline through which the majority of refugees flow to our shores.

 It would be an important start to have them sign on and become part of the international solution to this issue.

 I urge the Prime Minister to put this issue on the table and pursue it at CHOGM.

 Furthermore, Indonesia also hasn’t signed the Protocol, and clearly the Bali Conference on people smugglers provides an opportunity to pursue the matter with them.

 ***

 I have spoken already about the need to outline to the Australian people the economic benefits of immigration.

 Another way we can help rebuild public confidence in immigration is through strengthening and modernizing the concept of multiculturalism and thinking constructively about how we enhance citizenship.

 If we develop a greater understanding of what rights and duties all Australians owe to each other, we can tackle the reluctance in some quarters to embrace immigration more widely.

 7

 So population policy should also encompass a new examination of what we mean by multiculturalism and what rights and duties we all owe each other as citizens. ***

 I want to congratulate Premier Bracks for initiating this conference and placing the issue of population policy on the agenda once more.

 A population policy is vital for the nation’s future.

 But we must move the argument forward.

 Let’s rebuild the bipartisanship to underpin an approach that was until recently the envy of the rest of the world.

 Let’s get the nation behind a long-term and lasting solution.
