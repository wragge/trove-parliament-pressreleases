 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/1158 FRIDAY 24 DECEMBER 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT DEPUTY LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS BARTLETT URGES HOWARD TO HEED HIS OWN CHRISTMAS MESSAGE - Time for an Act of Grace Queensland Senator Andrew Bartlett has urged the Prime Minister to act on his own Christmas message to the Australian people to not forget those less fortunate than themselves. "Mr Howard is right in saying that for some people Christmas can be a time of stress and loneliness. He can do his own bit to reduce some of that stress by freeing the innocent people he has kept locked up in detention for over 5 years and allowing refugees in Australia to reunite with their families." "Christmas is the ideal time to acknowledge that doing what we can to end suffering is more important than being seen to be right or wrong in a policy debate. The Government could easily end the suffering of these people tomorrow without having to acknowledge a mistake or set any legal precedent.  "While I disagree with how it was achieved, the fact is that there has been a drop in the number of asylum seekers arriving in Australia. Showing an act of grace at Christmas time to those still enduring torment will end this running sore on the Australian political scene and help the whole nation move forward. "While there will always be debate about how best to deal with asylum seekers, there can be no question that these people have suffered enough." Christmas Day will see the latest changeover in the 'rolling strike' of people fasting for three days in support of asylum seekers still in detention. The people who took over from Senator Bartlett's fast last Wednesday will 'pass on the baton' to others in Brisbane on Christmas Day. This action is part of similar actions in support of end to the suffering of asylum seekers that continue to take place around Australia, including a Christmas Day fast in Melbourne. Media Contact - Rowena Bew - 0400 729 555 WHAT:     People ending a three day fast will hand over to others starting up their fast in support of justice for asylum seekers and refugees. Senator Bartlett will also be available for comment. WHERE:   Under the Christmas Tree in King George Square, outside City Hall in Brisbane WHEN:      11am Christmas Day
