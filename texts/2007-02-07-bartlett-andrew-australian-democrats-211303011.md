 TEST FOR NEW IMMIGRATION MINISTER TO CONTINUE  DEPARTMENT'S CULTURE CHANGE   

 Media Statement   Wed 7  Februar th y 2007

 Democrat Immigration spokesperson Senator Andrew Bartlett says the release of the latest  Ombudsman's report into people in long-term detention shows there is still a need for the newly  appointed Immigration Minister to continue pushing for a culture change in the Department.  

 "The Ombudsman's report shows that suffering is still continuing for many people, and repeats the  ongoing pattern of major trauma and harm faced by asylum seekers in detention," Senator Bartlett said. 

 "Many of these people have been in detention, having limited contact with the wider community, for as  long as 4 - 6 years and some still face an uncertain future.  

 "The report shows that in many cases their suffering has been exacerbated by ongoing poor treatment  by the Department.    

 "In one case examined by the Ombudsman, an asylum seeker was finally granted a Temporary  Protection Visa (TPV), but is still left in limbo on this class of visa despite repeated recommendations  by the Ombudsman that he be granted permanent asylum. 

 "People deserve to have their cases finalised promptly to allow them to move forward with their lives  with as little trauma as possible.  

 "The new Minister, Kevin Andrews, faces a major test to ensure that changes to the culture of DIAC  continue and the unnecessary cruelty and suffering of asylum seekers and detainees ends," Senator  Bartlett said.
