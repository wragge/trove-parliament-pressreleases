  BOAT PEOPLE PROCESSING CENTRE TO BE MOTHBALLED 

  The reception and processing centre for unauthorised boat arrivals at RAAF Base Curtin near  Derby in Western Australia, will be mothballed, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus said today. 

  "The very successful operation to remove Vietnamese refugees to China under the Safe Third  Country Legislation means there is now ample accommodation at Port Hedland for all  remaining boat people," Senator Bolkus said.  , 

  In January agreement was reached between the Department of Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs and the Department of Defence to use the facilities at RAAF Base Curtin until the  end of March 1996. 

  "The base was activated in April this year after the arrival of a significant number of boats  made the processing centre a cost-effective response to boat people accommodation, " Senator  Bolkus said. 

  "The situation has been under review for the past month and because there are only 30  people being held at the centre, plans are being made to transfer them to Port Hedland and  to wind down the operations at Curtin. " . 

  The Curtin centre. which can accommodate 270 people, will not be fully shut down until  March next year when it will be handed back to Defence. 

  "The Curtin centre could be re-activated in about a week should we require additional  accommodation," Senator Bolkus said. 

  The cost of commissioning the centre was approximately â‘ half a million dollars and running  costs were just under half a million dollars a month, although they have dropped with the  lower numbers being held at the centre in recent months. 

  The Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre houses about 430 people,  which is well below its effective capacity. 

  The Department has investigated a wide range of potential short-term and long-term facilities  for boat people. It is continuing to examine a number of possible sites for longer term  accommodation, should it be required.
