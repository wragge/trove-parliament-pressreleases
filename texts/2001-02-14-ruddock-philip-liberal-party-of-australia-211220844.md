 ALP Undermines Efforts to Deter Illegal Migration MPS 013/2001

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock said today that Labor State Governments are funding incentives which will be used by people smugglers to encourage unlawful arrivals to Australia.

 The Tasmanian Labor Government has joined the Victorian Government in giving incentives to unlawful arrivals released on Temporary Protection Visas.

 The Tasmanian Labor Government has just provided $5000 direct support to local councils to support TPV holders.

 The Bracks Labor Government in Victoria has given direct support of over $100,000 to TPV holders, as well as claiming to be providing housing and other services totalling $625,000.

 The Queensland Labor government gives TPV holders priority placement on the public housing list. This means that some Queenslanders could see their entitlement to housing given to an unlawful arrival ahead of them.

 "This is yet another queue that the ALP is encouraging unlawful arrivals to jump," Mr Ruddock said.

 "The Commonwealth Government provides TPV holders with exactly the same level of support that it provides Australian residents in similar circumstances.

 "When TPV holders are released into the community they are entitled to apply for Special Benefit, Medicare, torture and trauma counselling, parenting allowance, rental assistance

 and other family payments.

 "What the ALP is saying is that these people are entitled to a higher level of support than ordinary Australians. That is a clear signal to the people smugglers that Australia is softening its stance on their nefarious activities.

 "The Commonwealth Government is determined to halt this gruesome trade. Reducing incentives that make Australia the destination of choice for people smugglers is only part of a broader strategy.

 "Other measures include supporting refugees in countries of first asylum and working co-operatively with source and transit countries to ensure people are informed about the legal and safe opportunities for resettlement or repatriation, rather than resorting to using people smugglers."

 "The ALP seems to be deliberately sabotaging the Government's efforts and I would ask the federal leadership of the ALP whether they will bring their state colleagues into line," Mr Ruddock said.
