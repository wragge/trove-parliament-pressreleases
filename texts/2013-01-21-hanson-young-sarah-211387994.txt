 Senator to tour Manus Island detention centre  amid legal challenge   

 Amid growing concerns over conditions in the Manus Island detention centre, Australian Greens  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young announced today that she plans to tour the facility next week.   

 “We have heard many reports of substandard facilities and attempted self-harm at the Manus Island  detention centre, but I want to see it for myself,” the Greens immigration spokesperson, Senator  Sarah Hanson-Young said today.   

 “I will be travelling to Papua New Guinea next week and intend to inspect the detention centre on  Manus Island and will seek to meet with refugees and detention centre staff.   

 “Billions of tax payer dollars are being spent on offshore detention and the Australian public  deserves to know exactly what is happening on Manus Island.   

 “I am extremely concerned for the welfare of the children who are currently being detained there.   

 “We will watch the current legal challenge in PNG with interest but what we know already is that the  Australian Government is acting outside of the Refugee Convention.   

 “Punishing refugees for seeking protection is a breach of international law.   

 “Surely, as a nation, we can see that adopting a more humanitarian approach, which will save the tax  payer billions of dollars, is the only right and Australian thing for us to do.”
