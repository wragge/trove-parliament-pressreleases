 Labor Hears Young Voices After serving her time on the supermarket check out, Nicola Roxon and her Labor colleagues Michelle O’Byrne and Kirsten Livermore, presented their report today to Labor leader Simon Crean.

 A Snapshot of Youth 2002 is a report which combines the hands on experiences of Labor MPs during National Youth week plus the results of Labor’s survey of over 2000 young people across the country.

 The report shows that the top five things that young people said they would do if they were Prime Minister are remove the GST, fix poverty, increase (or reduce) the number of refugees, improve the environment and increase education spending.

 The report lets you hear the voices of young people directly: â¢ Get rid of the GST.  Have more youth activities to keep youth out of trouble, Michael, 21, Boyne Island QLD â¢ I would build more skate parks and bike jumps and since I’ve

 taken John Howard’s job I would send him to Afghanistan and he would not be allowed to enter the country, Male, 11, Broadmeadows, Vic â¢ I would make the world a more safer place to live in and no violence to continue in the world and get Osama! Male, 16, Huntingdale, WA â¢ Create jobs for every unemployed person and remove the GST, Tanya, 20, Bundaberg QLD

 Young people have great contributions to the debates on how this country should be run.  The Report gives Simon Crean and Labor some solid material to use as part of our consultation and policy development process in the future.

 The report includes collated survey results and many direct quotes from young people.  The full text is available at  www.nicolaroxonmp.com 12 April 2002
