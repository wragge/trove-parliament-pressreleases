 Press Release Ref: 787 Published: 2/9/2002 Title: $8,240 Federal grant for South Coast Migrant Services 

 Queanbeyan Multilingual Centre has been given a financial boost to help carry out important  work on the South Coast for the next 12 months.

 Federal Member for Eden-Monaro, Gary Nairn, today announced $8,240 funding under the $16-million Community Settlement Services Scheme.

 “This money will be used to assist migrants, refugees and humanitarian entrants to settle  quickly and effectively into the local community,” he said.

 The funding application was made by the Queanbeyan Multilingual Centre to enable the  organisation to provide an information and referral service to small and emerging communities  in the Eurobodalla, Bega and Eden regions. 

 Mr Nairn added, “Migrants moving into regional areas are often faced with unique hurdles to  overcome and support services may be harder to access. In cities, migrants often have family  networks and friends who have migrated before them for support.

 “This grant will assist those who come to the South Coast to settle into the community,  contribute their skills, and share their unique culture for the benefit of the whole region.

 “The principle objective of settlement services is to contribute to the adjustment by migrants and  humanitarian entrants to life in Australia so that they can achieve independence and participate  fully in Australian society soon after their arrival.

 “Queanbeyan Multilingual Centre will play an important role in this process, by providing their  clients with the advice and support which will equip them to enter the broader community  confidently, and to avail themselves of the opportunities and services open to all Australians,”  Mr Nairn concluded.
