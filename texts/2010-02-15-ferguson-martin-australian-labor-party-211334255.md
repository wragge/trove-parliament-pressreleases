 Laurie Ferguson MP 

 Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services 

 Funding boost for newly arrived migrants and refugees in the ACT 

 15 February 2010 

 Canberra’s migrant and refugee settlement services will receive essential funding  under the Australian Government’s Diverse Australia Program, the Parliamentary  Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services, Laurie Ferguson,  announced today in the lead up to Harmony Day on   March 21. 

 ‘The Diverse Australia Program promotes a sense of belonging for everyone in a  practical way - delivering funding to groups and organisations that make a real  difference to Australian communities,’ Mr Ferguson said.  

 Member for Fraser Bob McMullan said that, under the program, Migrant and  Refugee Settlement Services of the ACT will receive $26 600 to establish and run  the Harmony Players Project. 

 The project will offer about 25 young men a range of social and cultural activities  such as sports, mentoring and leadership training with organisations like ACT  Scouts. 

 ‘Many of these young men have already overcome considerable odds to escape  hardship in their former homelands and begin their new lives in Australia,’ Mr  McMullan said. 

 ‘Yet they still face many difficulties in being able to get involved in our community  because of their limited English skills and unfamiliarity with Australian customs and  culture.’ 

 Activities will also include skill development through coaching, participation in  mainstream basketball competitions, referee training courses and social activities  involving families, friends and communities. There will be mentoring and  presentations at local primary schools, and interaction with ACT Police. 

 More information on the 2009 Diverse Australia Program can be found at the Diverse  Australia Program website.  See: www.harmony.gov.au
