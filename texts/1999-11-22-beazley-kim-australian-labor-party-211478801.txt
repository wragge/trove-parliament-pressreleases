  LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

  

  

  TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,

  22 NOVEMBER 1999

  

  Subjects: Illegal immigrants, business tax, Cheryl Kernot

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Mr Beazley, would it be hypocritical for the Opposition 
to say the Government’s immigration legislation will have no effect, 
and then support it?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, I think there’s a couple of things that need 
to be said about the immigration legislation. Firstly, we are opposed 
to illegal migration and have supported all this year a series of steps 
the Government has taken to increase punishment upon those who traffic 
in human sadness. And that remains our position. We demand only one 
thing of Government legislation, as far as this is concerned, and that 
is effectiveness. So, we’ll be taking a careful look at the Government’s 
propositions over the next day or so to determine whether or not we 
think they are effective. I raise this question: If it is suggested 
to some person that they’re going to get easier passage into a three 
year visa with, effectively, the right to continue it after that, is 
that actually going to stop illegal Immigration, as the Government says 
it will? I think the Government has talked up a storm around this, and 
is likely to be disappointed by it.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 At the end of the day, though, are you more inclined 
to support the Democrats motion or not support it?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 As I said, we’re going to take a look at this with 
one criteria in mind: will this stop illegal migration, or assist substantially 
in the process of stopping illegal migration. That is our principal 
concern with it.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Your own spokesman seems sure that it won’t, that 
these measures are ineffective. He knows this already, yet he says that, 
you know, you’re still thinking about supporting it despite the fact 
you think they’re ineffective?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, there’s a lot of people out there with an 
argument around it. But I ask you this question, contemplate this situation: 
Is a hard-pressed officer of the Immigration Department likely to take 
a more or less severe attitude to somebody’s claim of a refugee status 
if they’re able to clear the decks with a three year proposition, 
knowing that it will get reviewed down the line? Albeit, the likelihood 
of anyone being sent home in that arrangement is pretty remote. Is it 
going to make it more likely that the Immigration official will be tough-minded, 
or less likely? These are the things that we’re going to work on over 
the course of the next couple of days.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Should these measures be much tougher, then? I mean, 
can you propose some measures that could be brought into this arrangement 
that could be tougher?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 I think the best signal that we could send the rest 
of the world, apart from visits to countries of origin and those who 
are engaged in this illegal trafficking, would be to form an Australian 
coastguard. That would be an Indication that we regarded these and other 
illicit activities seriously, and would be a marvellous signal to the 
rest of the world, it would be far more effective than anything I’ve 
seen so far emanate from the Government.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 How much would that cost?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, that is something that we’d need to sit down 
and work our way through. There would obviously be assets that are currently 
In place that could be Incorporated within a coastguard, but there’s 
no doubt It would cost it would mean you’d have to develop specialised 
ships and aircraft, as well as using existing assets. But you could 
build up to that. The actual creation of a coastguard service would 
be a very substantial signal to the rest of the world that we are closed 
for business, as far as illegal activities are concerned.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Why do you think the Government’s refusing to look 
at that option?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 I think they probably think it’s expensive. I think 
they’ve probably got bureaucratic internecine warfare on this matter 
between a serious of Departments. That’s always been an inhibition 
on the development of the coastguard. Is it a police responsibility? 
Is it Immigration? Is it Customs or Defence? These are all the sorts 
of issues that get raised when you talk about a coastguard. And general 
bureaucratic wrangling makes it hard to put in place But the job of 
governments Is to cut through that sort of problem, and the Government 
ought to.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 On business tax. Are you worried that if a report 
comes out today that the proposals aren’t revenue-neutral. Will you 
still support the proposals?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 We regard one of our tasks as making them revenue-neutral. 
If here’s clear-cut evidence that they are not revenue-neutral we 
say to the government,   ‘you undertook that they would be. Make them revenue-neutral. Take 
the steps that you need to take to ensure that that happens’.  
As I said...actually, we’ve been saying for a very substantial period 
of time now, we have got an open mind on the Government’s business 
tax proposals with a disposition to support them, a disposition to support 
them provided they keep their undertakings. And there are very good 
reasons why they should keep their undertakings. We have a problem in 
Timor. It’s costing us money. We have a starved education system. 
It needs more money. There are a whole range of activities that this 
Government needs to undertake if we are to be a society, as opposed 
to simply an economy, for which resources are needed. There is not the 
slightest justification, not the slightest justification, for a business 
tax package which is not revenue-neutral. Hence, we will take that seriously. 
And I would advise the Government to take it seriously, too, if It wants 
its legislation passed.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Is that more anti-avoidance measures, then?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Well, the anti-avoidance measures that they have foreshadowed, 
which, incidentally, many of them not directly related to the business 
tax package but to their undertakings in regard to the GST package - 
cracking down on avoidance associated with the dollars that have been 
spent on that -we have not seen the legislation that is associated with 
that. And all we see on a day-to-day basis is pressure upon the Government 
from their allies to backslide. 56, we want to see a bit of evidence 
on that front, too. We’re not opposed to the business tax changes 
that have been put up, per se. What we are opposed to is any slippage 
in Commonwealth revenue when we have crying needs: in education, health, 
and defence.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Are you going to be seeking any talks with Mr Costello 
this week, or is Mr Crean?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Mr Crean’s constantly talking ... well, seeking 
talks with Mr Costello and he’s had a number of conversations with 
Mr Costello and his officials. We remain open to that all the time.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Mr Beazley, what’s the latest on Cheryl Kernot?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 She’s ill, and she’s still in hospital, and I 
hope she takes all the time that she needs to get herself thoroughly 
well, because she has a big task to perform for us over the course of 
the next couple of years.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 And you’re happy for her to take whatever time it 
needs for her to recover?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Absolutely, absolutely. We’re a couple of years 
away from an election. Despite the fact that we’ve got Peter Reith, 
It seems to be the case, wandering around hospitals in Brisbane in pajamas 
trying to find her and deliver flowers. We note the fact that the election’s 
still a couple of years away. Plenty of time to put down good policy.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Just one more thing on the coastguard proposal. Do 
you think that putting this thing forward, one of the reasons the Government 
might not be supporting it at the moment is because it shows some lack 
of confidence in the people that are doing the job at the moment?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 No lack of confidence in them at all. But the point 
is, you’ve got about four different agencies operating in protecting 
our coastline, and you have obvious substantial problems related to 
the movement of illicit drugs and related to the movement of illegal 
migrants. Now, more and more, defence, these days, is not simply about 
the classic requirements of being able to mount countermeasures to an 
invasion. More and more, it is, these days, dealing with problems of 
illegalities right the way up. I suppose, at the lowest level, from 
the movement of Illegal migrants up to, at the highest level, meeting 
the possibilities of well-armed international terrorists. In these sorts 
of circumstances, very clear signals need to be sent. And. for a maritime 
country like Australia, one of the clearest signals you can send is 
a coastguard.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Are we doing enough diplomatically in regard to third 
countries, perhaps, particularly, Indonesia on this issue?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 Whatever we’re doing diplomatically, we’re falling. 
There is no question about that. And under previous governments we succeeded. 
So, this is Mr Ruddock’s problem. Instead of Mr Ruddock setting up 
this perpetual scream for the Opposition to support him as he flaps 
his hands looking for easy solutions to this difficult problem, Mr Ruddock 
Is the person responsible. And the simple fact of the matter is, we 
were able to deal with these issues diplomatically prior to Mr Ruddock 
holding this portfolio, and it appears at the moment we are unable to. 
Now, that may not be all Mr Ruddock’s fault, but Mr Ruddock, Instead 
of chattering away about what the Labor Party might do in Parliament, 
he might actually have recourse to thinking about the fact that he’s 
the bloke with the salary to deal with it.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Any suggestion Indonesia might be turning a blind 
eye in the fall-out from East Timor?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

 If they are, Mr Ruddock should deal with it.
