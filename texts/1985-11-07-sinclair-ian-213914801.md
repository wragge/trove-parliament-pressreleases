 ADDRESS BY THE LEADER OF THE NATIONAL PARTY, THE RT HON. IAN SINCLAIR, M.P., AT THE 1985 NORTHERN AUSTRALIA DEVELOPMENT  CONFERENCE, "COMMONWEALTH PERSPECTIVE OF THE NORTH": CINEMA DARWIN - THURSDAY, 7TH NOVEMBER 1985 '

 "NORTHERN AUSTRALIA 2000"

 Over the last few months there has been a great deal of planning 

 and preparation - not without some administrative problems, of 

 course - for the 1988 Bicentennial celebrations.

 The aim of the program is not just to -celebrate the event, but to 

 ensure worthwhile community goals are achieved.

 In Opposition, the National Party sees it worthwhile to look 

 forward,  to define the environment we want to see then set the 

 mileposts by which these goals can be achieved.

 Of course, even in the short term, looking into the future is 

 difficult.

 Those who return to northern Australia today after serving here 

 during World War II, for example, note your enormous progress.

 There is population growth, a healthy mix of peoples of varied 

 race and background, economic progress and vibrant new towns and 

 cities from the Indian Ocean to the Great Barrier Reef. *

 Although Northern Australia is the envy of the nation, however, 

 it has problems.

 Without the Government's impossible uranium policy, the mining 

 industry would be even more significant in the North and creating 

 even greater optimism about the region's future. â

 The sugar industry,  which until a few years ago employed directly 

 or indirectly more than half of Australia's population north of 

 the Tropic of Capricorn, is heading backward because of , 

 international marketing problems resulting from the Common 

 Agricultural Policy of the European Community. .  '  _  â 

 In the Northern Territory, although self-government has brought a 

 new identity in local administration, Federal policies on *

 Aboriginal land rights have led to the progressive alienation of 

 an important part of the Northern Territory population. Often 

 the pastoral and mining industries are frustrated in pursuing new 

 investments.

 In Western Australia, the Ord River Scheme conceived as a basis 

 for intense agricultural development, has not yet realised the 

 full potential of sunshine and water.

 Where to then Northern Australia? Looking forward to the year 

 2000, what does Northern Australia seek?

 i

 Let me identify the environment as I see it.

 Darwin today is one of Australia's most rapidly growing _

 communities. .

 In the ten years since Cyclone Tracy,  the population of the 

 Territory as a whole has grown by over 51,000 - an increase of 

 55 per cent.

 Similarly, Cairns in North Queensland is exploding as its tourist 

 attractions make it a mecca for holiday makers from USA to Japan 

 and elsewhere around the globe.

 New communities have been established from Kununurra in Western 

 Australia to Pine Creek and Nhulunbuy in the Territory and 

 Karumba and Weipa in north Queensland.

 By the year 2000 it is reasonable to expect the population of 

 north Australia will approach one million people, if the 

 potential of new mining development, particularly uranium mining 

 and the benefits of off shore natural gas and hopefully oil, are 

 realised.

 New population centres will be established and processing and 

 production will generate new jobs.

 :  .  I

 There will be a new urban aggregation around Katherine, with the 

 completion of Tindal as a major RAAF base.

 I see Tindal as part of a wider defence complex,' with its 

 potential for joint service training and exercise areas adjacent 

 to it.

 The mix of races that is the unique population blend of the north 

 will continue.

 A new wave of migration is needed to take advantage of the 

 diverse natural resources of the north' and to facilitate 

 population growth faster than natural increases in these days of 

 one or two child families would allow.

 Abundant off shore natural gas and possibly oil gives promise of 

 cheaper power, easier processing and greater industrialisation. 

 With this, the north in more ways than geographically will become 

 Australia's gateway to Asia.

 The fishing industry will continue to grow with proper resources 

 management contributing significantly to Australia's export 

 earnings.

 Prawn farming will ensure that marine resources increase to meet 

 demand and maintain the industry’s throughput.

 5

 Crocodile farming, pearling and tropical agriculture will add 

 their diverse contributions to the region's economy.

 With people will come the progress essential to the realisation 

 of the aspirations of the north.

 There must be a new Alice Springs to Darwin railway. The 

 nonsensical industrial restraints on Australian flag merchant 

 vessels must either be removed to offer an economic transport 

 alternative or domestic shipping routes opened to overseas flag 

 vessels. .  â   -

 Tindal aside, defence will play its part in northern development.

 The naval base in Darwin needs a berth for frigates and the new 

 generation submarines.

 Naval facilities at least for patrol boat operations need to be 

 developed in or about Port Hedland to mirror those at HMAS 

 Cairns.

 The Norforce concept of an integrated permanent/reserve army 

 element needs to be extended with at least company size 

 detachments in the North of West Australia and North Queensland.

 > = ?

 $

 Norforce in the Northern Territory needs to be further expanded 

 with regular exercise co-ordination with the ODF from Laverack 

 Barracks in Townsville.

 Not only will the RAAF base at Tindal be a major FA18 facility 

 and Darwin a continued staging base for US long range military 

 aircraft but new RAAF airfields will be in use in Derby in West 

 Australia and Weipa or thereabouts in North Queensland.

 Darwin will be the capital of Australia's 7,th State (is it to be 

 "Northern Australia"?) offering a diverse educational oportunity 

 for its predominantly young population at tertiary, secondary and 

 primary levels . . . . .

 The inept step which saw the handing over of Ayers Rock to a few 

 Aboriginals with uncertain claim to that title will have been 

 reversed, and will be only a distant memory.

 The new State Government will be administering all National Parks 

 within the borders of what is now called the Northern Territory, 

 and will be ensuring a proper relationship between pastoral 

 country, mineral resources and Aboriginal land.

 Aboriginals will be integrated into the Australian community, not 

 isolated from it, while preserving their native culture and 

 traditions.

 Of course, there will still be significant areas in the Territory 

 set aside for Aboriginals but not denying economic progress or 

 resource development.

 The new State .cannot afford to be divided with large tracts of 

 land unable to contribute to its peoples' well-being in the way 

 of those now set aside in Commonwealth administered National 

 Parks and for Aboriginal collective ownership.

 For young people, education opportunities will provide better 

 trade and professional skills to help industry growth, getting 

 jobs, and building a richer and better local future.

 Prosperity will still depend critically on the attitudes to 

 northern development of the Federal Government of the day and its 

 economic and industrial policies.

 There will have to be a fair and equitable financial agreement 

 not wilfully and politically manipulated as the Hawke 'Government 

 is today manipulating the Memorandum of Understanding exchanged 

 after self-government.

 Transport - road, rail, sea and air - needs to be competitive and 

 not hampered either by antediluvian industrial practices or the 

 Federal Government's failure to adequately fund developmental· '

 8

 In industrial relations, the Mudginberri lesson must be learned.

 The Federal Government must legislate for reasonably negotiated 

 contractual arrangements between employer and employee to be 

 legally enforceable by either party and widened to facilitate . 

 arrangements negating penalty rates and other inequitable 

 on-labour costs.

 In North Queensland the sugar industry must be able in the future 

 to contribute still to employment and export earnings.

 John Kerin's persistent failure to accept normal Commonwealth 

 responsibility for immediate financial help to this important 

 export industry, however, makes me pessimistic about the 

 industry's future.

 The National Party believes that Federal help must be provided 

 urgently so that long term solutions can be found.

 For the Ord scheme and other closer settlement projects in the 

 north by the year 2000 surely, there will be a way to enable 

 viable crop production in spite of animal, bird and insect 

 predators, distance from markets and input costs.

 Certainly, adequate research must be funded to overcome agronomic 

 problems and production difficulties.

 9

 If this is to be the scene by 2000 a great deal of present 

 inertia must be overcome.

 Tomorrow will not just happen if we forget about today’s 

 realities.

 There are a number of obvious challenges.

 Hotel licensees, moteliers, tour operators, restaurateurs and 

 entrepreneurial services must be encouraged to provide an 

 internationally competitive tourist environment where 'service 

 with a smile'  is routine and reasonable profits possible.

 If people,  progress and prosperity are the domestic goals, peace 

 is essential abroad.

 Defence and foreign policy are always judged more sensitively in 

 Northern Australia where proximity, like the hangman's noose, 

 seems to sharpen the mind. .

 In my view no one of us can be sanguine about developments in 

 Papua New Guinea and its border problems with Irian Jaya.

 Transmigration has generated -fears among the highlanders and they 

 a r e .voting with their feet. Darwin was in the ’front line’  in

 the reception of the boat people 

 be with Irian Jayan refugees.

 from Vietnam. So too will you

 - 10

 The position has been exacerbated by Bill Hayden's questioning of 

 Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor and his usurping of 

 Indonesia's perceived role in negotiations with Vietnam about the 

 future of Kampuchea.

 -The souring of Indonesian/Australian relations makes the 

 negotiations on the Irian Jayan refugee question more difficult.

 An open door policy could encourage an unwanted flood while a 

 harsh and absolute refusal would be a denial of our humanitarian 

 responsibilities. -  :  .

 I doubt Labor's ability to negotiate through these sensitive 

 diplomatic shoals. .  â 

 Elsewhere in ASEAN and in the South Pacific, our regional 

 responsibilities, common sense and prospects for instability 

 suggest a no less responsible and sensitive roles.

 New Caledonia, the succession in the Philippines and the 

 significant and increasing presence of Soviet armed forces in Cam 

 Ranh Bay are important regional issues requiring a response that 

 the Government's passive acceptance to the ending of ANZUS 

 ignores.

 Mr Chairman, .

 At least as importantly, economically Australia today is living 

 beyond its means.

 So to 1  people, progress, prosperity and peace', let me add 

 'Profit'. '

 We are borrowing extensively overseas to maintain our standard of 

 living while denying the chance of survival to the rural and 

 mining export industries whose overseas earnings are essential to 

 regain our international solvency.

 The Treasurer's hasty visit to the United States and the United 

 Kingdom to talk up the Australian dollar is not a substitute for 

 strong economic management, cutting Government spending (at all 

 levels), restricting overseas borrowing unrelated to potential 

 export returns or new expertise, and forgoing this week's 

 national wage increase.

 Keating's latest tax package is a farce and brings little relief 

 to hard-pressed Australian taxpayers.

 > -  '

 12

 There needs to be adequate reward to the traditional Australian 

 family with dependants,  and choice in health care and in 

 education. .

 This it ignores. Imputation of dividends is offset by Company 

 tax increases. Capital Gains tax, fringe benefits tax, 

 entertainment tax, non-offsetting farm losses and the ending of 

 negative gearing do nothing for investor confidence.

 Present zone"allowances no longer provide the equal work 

 environment the system intended.

 For some, the north is seen as Australia's California. To 

 achieve that title it needs positive encouragement from Canberra, 

 not hindrance.

 I recognise the record of Commonwealth assistance to the North 

 has been patchy.

 The Aboriginal land rights policy here in the Territory of the 

 former Coalition Government and the uranium policy of the present 

 Government are two good reasons for the North's distrust of 

 Canberra and all it stands for.

 Even when Commonwealth intervention has been well-intentioned, 

 performance has not always equalled promises.

 The fact that the only north-south rail link in Central Australia 

 now ends abruptly in Alice Springs, instead of continuing on to 

 Darwin, is evidence of that.

 The Commonwealth brought in the chief executive of a State rail 

 system which manages to lose a fortune in taxpayers' money each 

 year to provide it with an excuse to welch on its promise.

 It might be argued that someone used to running an uneconomic 

 rail system was well gualified to recognise the problems,  but 

 Mr Hill's report on the Darwin to Alice Springs rail link 

 reminded me of the professor who was lecturing on cause and 

 effect. .

 Placing a flea on a lectern,  he called on it to jump, and it did. 

 Then,  producing a scalpel, he cut off the flea's legs.

 When he again called on it to jump, of course it could not.

 The professor announced the results gravely.

 "We have proved conclusively," he said,  "that when the legs of a 

 flea are amputated the creature is rendered completely deaf." ,

 Mr Chairman,

 The National Party does not base its policies on the kind of 

 logic which argues that legless fleas are deaf.

 I think our view could be summed up in the verse from Proverbs, 

 chapter 29: "Where there is no vision, the people perish".

 The National Party believes that Northern Australia is the area 

 of single greatest potential to the nation. .  _-

 We believe that Commonwealth policies must reflect that, and be 

 aimed not only at the present", but the future as well. .

 Consistent with all our policies, we believe that the best people 

 to make the decisions about Northern Australia and to put them 

 into action are those who live here and who have the greatest 

 stake in the region's future.

 Like the States, you must be placed in the position to accept 

 responsibility for the decisions you take. ,

 The Federal Council of the National Party met in Canberra last 

 month and debated a number of issues of importance to Northern 

 Australia.

 I want to draw two of them, in particular, to the attention of

 this Conference. -

 The first called for the establishment on the return of a

 Coalition Government of a Northern Development Task Force.

 Our Party's Federal Council believes the priority areas for

 investigation are:

 - the adverse effects of inadequate representation of the North 

 in Federal Parliament;

 - the deterrent effect of present taxation policy on Northern 

 Development;

 - the North's need for adequate road,  rail, air and sea 

 transport; and

 - the need for further development of defence facilities, 

 tourism, mining and primary and tertiary industries in the ' 

 North.

 This proposal deserves the closest examination.

 j

 U\

 16

 It is vital that there is a coherent approach along these lines 

 by the next. Coalition Government to the problems and potential of 

 the North.

 And it must closely involve the people of Northern Australia and 

 their representatives at all stages of formulation.

 That brings me to the second resolution of the Federal Council of 

 the National Party.

 It is short, so I shall read it in full. It states:

 "That this Council recognises and supports the desire of 

 the Government of the Northern Territory to progress the 

 Northern Territory to full Statehood under the 

 Constitution of Australia as expeditiously as possible 

 and requests our Party in Federal Government to pursue 

 this objective vigorously."

 It is significant that the motion was moved by the President of 

 the National Party in Queensland, Sir Robert Sparkes, and 

 seconded by the President of the National Party in Victoria,

 Mr Stuart McDonald.

 This demonstrates the broad support the resolution attracted.

 17

 On behalf of my Party colleagues in Federal Parliament, I have 

 pleasure in assuring this Conference and all the people of the 

 Territory that in the next Coalition Government, we will be doing 

 just what this motion calls for.

 The National Party and the previous Coalition Government started 

 the Territory on the path to Statehood - the next Coalition 

 Government must finish this important task.
