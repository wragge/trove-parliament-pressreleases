  Labor’s Secret Plan to Abandon Mandatory Detention 

  Labor MP, Anna Burke has let the cat out of the bag in regard to Labor‘s secret plans to  abandon mandatory detention, Senator Amanda Vanstone said today. 

  ”The Labor Party is not rebuking her because Labor’s secret plan has always been to  get rid of mandatory detention for unauthorised arrivals. 

  “They want to hold the door open for people smugglers. 

  “Ms Burke and the Labor Party want to let the world know that Australia open for  business to people smugglers. 

  Labor plans to have a coastguard to ‘meet and greet’ the boats and bring them to shore. 

  Once they get to shore Labor will reward people smugglers with exactly the result they  wanted for their paying customers, access to Australia’s legal system and generous  health and welfare system. 

  Until there is a flood of people that is. 

  Labor wants to pretend it would provide a firm hand for Australia’s future but its MPs say  otherwise. 

  Under the Howard Government boat arrivals through people smugglers have been  dramatically reduced. Our policies work.
