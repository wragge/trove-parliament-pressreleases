 MINISTER WELCOMES COMMITTEE REPORT ON REFUGEE AND  HUMANITARIAN SYSTEM

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Gerry Hand today welcomed the release of the Report  on Australia's Refugee and Humanitarian System by the Joint  Standing Committee on Migration Regulations.

 Mr Hand said he was pleased that the report generally  endorses major refugee policy directions taken by the  Government.

 "This report deals with one of the most difficult and  sensitive policy challenges of our time, and it is  reassuring to have a bipartisan report of this kind," he  said.

 A number of the Committee's recommendations have already  been addressed by the Government:

 - my recent announcement on the establishment of the  Refugee Review Tribunal[RRT] answers most of the  concerns of the Committee relating to review  mechanisms;

 - likewise, the proposal to enable humanitarian  consideration by the RRT has already been adopted;

 - short extended stay for people affected by civil unrest  is already provided for;

 - recently announced legislative changes will simplify  the law affecting border claimants for refugee status;

 - faster processing for boat people has been achieved for  recent arrivals processed under new procedures;

 - permanent residence for torture trauma victims:  an  earlier provision to enable this has been withdrawn and  is currently under revision. It will be examined as a  matter of urgency;

 - support for the continued operation of the Port Hedland  processing centre is particularly welcome.

 Mr Hand said that while the recommendations relating to PRC  Temporary Entry Permit holders were likely to attract most  of the media attention, this part of the report should be  kept in perspective. |  ______ ______

 "The Government position on this issue has been stated many  times. It is a very complex one and it will take some time  to consider both the majority and the two minority  recommendations in detail," he said.

 A detailed reponse to all recommendations will be prepared  for tabling in Parliament as required for all Committee  reports.
