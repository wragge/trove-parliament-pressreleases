 MEDIA RELEASE  

                                                                                         23 June 2011  

 IMPROVED AND EXPANDED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR  SURVIVORS OF TRAUMA AND TORTURE    

 

 Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mark Butler, and Parliamentary  Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Kate Lundy, today  announced improved and expanded mental health services are now available  to refugees arriving in Australia who have experienced trauma and torture.    

 The new Program of Assistance for Survivors of Torture and Trauma (PASTT)  consolidates existing mental health services into one seamless program to  assist refugees successfully settle in Australia.      

 The Gillard Government will provide $55 million in funding to the PASST over  the next four years and almost $300,000 funding to the Forum of Australian  Services for Survivors of Torture and Trauma for information and training 

 resources to support GPs in the delivery of care to refugees who have  experienced torture and trauma.    

 “In many cases refugees have suffered the brutality of torture and other  traumatic experiences in their countries of origin, while fleeing or while living  in refugee camps,” Mr Butler said.    

 "Together, these two measures will help people struggling to cope with the  effects of such experiences to recover and rebuild new lives in Australia.”        

 Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator  Lundy, said the consolidated program would ensure greater consistency in the  delivery of torture and trauma services for refugees.    

 “Australia leads the world in the provision of settlement services and these  changes will ensure new refugees receive the care and support they need to  successfully build a new life in Australia,” Senator Lundy said.      

 “Given the hardships many humanitarian entrants overcome, they display  remarkable resilience in rebuilding their lives and contributing to Australian  society.”    

 The consolidated PASTT combines short term counselling services previously 

 funded through the Department of Immigration and Citizenship with longer  term assistance available through the Department of Health and Ageing into  one seamless service.    

 “This removes the need to transfer clients between different government  agencies ensuring they receive continuity of care and improved linkages with  other mainstream mental health and health services,” Mr Butler said.    

 An executive member of the Forum of Australian Services for Survivors of  Torture and Trauma, Mr Paris Aristotle said that “Australia now has one of the  most extensive and effective programs to care for refugees who were tortured  and traumatised anywhere in the world".      

 "These two measures will provide people who have survived horrific human  rights violations with the support they need to overcome their trauma and  establish a brighter future in safety and with dignity" Mr Aristotle said.    

 PASTT will provide counselling services and a range of other assistance to  more than 5,000 individuals and their families per year.  It will also assist other  services working with refugees through the provision of training, secondary  consultation and wider health network development.    

 Services provided through the new consolidated service include:  

 â¢ direct counselling and related support;   â¢ specific services to assist children and young people;   â¢ education and training to mainstream health and other services;   â¢ rural, regional and remote outreach services to enable torture and 

 trauma survivors to gain access to comparable services outside  metropolitan areas; and   â¢ development of resources to support and enhance provision of  specialist counselling and related support services. 

 

 “The Government is delivering on its ongoing commitment to continually  improve the range and quality of mental health services available to all  Australians, particularly for some of the newest and most vulnerable members 

 of our community,” Mr Butler said.      

 Through this year’s Budget, the Gillard Labor Government is delivering $2.2  billion in new measures - the single largest investment in mental health  services in this nation’s history.
