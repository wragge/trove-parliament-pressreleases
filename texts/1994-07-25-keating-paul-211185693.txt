 EMERGENCY RELIEF FOR RWANDA

 The humanitarian crisis in Rwanda deepens each day. Australians have  been shocked by the pictures of horror and suffering in the refugee  camps on the Rwandan borders.

 The refugees of Rwanda have issued an international distress call, and  Australia must respond.

 There are two challenges facing Australia and the rest of the  international community. The first is to deal with the crisis on Rwanda's  borders. The second, equally important, is to create the circumstances  inside Rwanda which will encourage the refugees to return home.

 Federal Cabinet has today decided to respond to both these challenges  by boosting Australia's total humanitarian relief to $10 million, and by  providing an Australian Medical Support Force of more than 300  personnel to support the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda  (UNAMIR).

 The Cabinet decision provides an additional $6.5 million aid package,  on top of the $3.5 million already committed to humanitarian assistance.

 Of the additional spending announced today:

 -- $3.25 million will be provided to Australian aid agencies working in the  field. Of this, $1.75 million will go to the public appeals conducted by  Australian aid agencies, with the remaining $1.5 million going directly to  specific relief programs.

 -  $3 million will be provided to the UN consolidated appeal announced  last Friday. This will address immediate humanitarian needs, the  repatriation of refugees, and the long-term rehabilitation of Rwanda.

 -  The Government has also arranged for the immediate despatch by the  first available plane of urgently needed medical supplies, including oral  rehydration kits, vitamins and anti-malarial drugs. These are valued at a  further $250,000. '

 In addition, the government will deploy as soon as possible two RAAF  C-130 aircraft to Rwanda with water purification and other aid  equipment.

 As I said, there is an equally urgent need to make it safe for the  refugees to return to their homes in Rwanda. The deployment of the  Medical Support Force is directed to this end.

 The force, based in Kigali Central Hospital, will be deployed for a period  of six months, with an option for a second six-month deployment.

 They will be supporting UNAMIR in its mission to contribute to the  security of civilians at risk in Rwanda, and to provide security and  support for the distribution of relief supplies and humanitarian  operations. The Australian Medical Support Force will also be able to 

 provide assistance to Rwandan civilians at the nearby King Faisal  Hospital.

 An advance party will be ready to leave Australia on 6 August, with the  remainder leaving two weeks later.

 In sum, this represents an appropriate response from the Government to  an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. It builds on the very generous $7  million already donated directly by the Australian community.
