  POPULATION POLICY: ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION 

  Speech delivered by the Hon Philip Ruddock MP, Minister for Immigration and  Multicultural Affairs , at the Urban Development Institute of Australia's 1997  National Congress on 4 March 1997. 

  Background 

  There has been considerable public discussion recently about population issues and  the question of a formal population policy. 

  The issue has been raised on a number of occasions by environmental and other  groups in my current round of community consultations on the 1997-98 immigration  intake. 

  The Federal Opposition has indicated that Australia should commit itself to the  development of a formal and active population policy: 

  Odd, isn't it that while in government, the now Opposition consistently  rejected calls for it to develop formal population policy. 

  The failings of the Labor Government notwithstanding , it is important that we can  discuss population issues. 

  In this speech to you today, I propose to outline some of the considerations that would  be relevant to such discussions and to the development of a formal population policy. 

  So what is a formal population policy? 

  Unfortunately , we have few useful international precedents that we can draw upon  to help us with this question. 

  We know that France and Singapore, for example, have in the past adopted policies  to encourage a higher birth rate. 

  Canada has had an annual immigration target of 1 % of its population although it has  never actually achieved the target: 

  Back in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Canada published 5 year projections of  its immigration intake although these have now been abandoned; 

  97-4793 Page 2 

  However, at no stage has Canada tried to link these immigration targets to a  formal population policy. 

  In 1993, the United States established the President's Council on Sustainable  Development: 

  In February 1996, the Council issued its report which recommends, amongst  other things, that the USA adopt a policy of stabilising its population as soon  as this is practical; 

  However, the report sets no time lines for this nor does it provide any details  on how this policy would be implemented; 

  There is no mention of the role of immigration in achieving this policy; and  I understand that the US Administration has not yet formally responded to  the report. 

  National Population Council Report 

  As far as australia is concerned, a better guide as to what a population policy might  be is contained in the 1992 report of the former National Population Council (NPC). 

  The NPC suggested that population policy can be many things including: 

  A general philosophical statement on population growth; or 

  A statement which is more specific, setting some future population growth  target or a population growth rate goal; or 

  A set of policies that address the integration of population change with  population distribution and other population characteristics; or . 

  A bringing together of population objectives with broader social, economic and  environmental goals; or 

  It might be all of the above. 

  The NPC considered all of these approaches. 

  It concluded and I quote: 

  That "a population policy is one whereby government seeks to anticipate and  respond to population trends and prospects in the light of their impacts and  anticipates impacts of public policy on population trends themselves. It also  directly seeks to influence the determinants of population in order to alter the  size and/or nature of the population." 

  The NPC argued that population policy has both a pro-active and a responsive  component; 

  The responsive component is about the arrangements Governments at all 

  97-4793 Page 3 

  levels have in place to deal with all aspects of population impact; 

  the NPC suggested that a critical element of the responsive component  is the development of a suitable demographic framework for  anticipation, monitoring and response. 

  The pro-active component deliberately seeks to influence population size,  location or characteristics although the NPC clearly rejected the idea that  governments should seek to influence such things as fertility levels, sex ratios  and ethnic composition. 

  I propose to now discuss these two components of population policy. 

  Pro-active population policy 

  A pro-active population policy would deliberately seek to change the directions that  Australia's population is currently projected to take. 

  A decision to adopt a pro-active population policy requires that we: 

  Have a clear understanding of the current directions of Australia's population; 

  Identify what realistic options there may be for moving away from these  current directions - that is options for a significantly higher or lower  population growth path; and 

  Decide whether any of these options would be better for Australia than the  current directions. 

  What are Australia's current population direction? 

  [Slide number 1] 

  This overhead illustrates past and possible future trends in Australia's population in  very broad terms. 

  It shows that Australia's population growth rate in 1995-96 was around 1.3 per cent: 

  While currently this is one of the faster rates of growth in the OECD, it is  projected to decline significantly over the next 50 years. 

  The projected decline in Australia's population growth rate is mainly due to a below  replacement birth rate and an ageing population. 

  In fact Australia's birth rate has been declining over the past 40 years from over 3  births per women in the 1950s to around 1.8 births per woman today. 

  Going on trends in other developed countries, this decline is likely to continue -Italy  for example has a birth rate as low as 1.2 births per woman while Japan's birth rate  is around 1.5 births per woman. 

  97-4793 Page 4 

  The current rate of natural increase in Australia's population is primarily due to the  large proportion of women who are of child-bearing age -that is the baby boomer  cohort. 

  As this cohort ages, the natural population growth rate will decline and eventually  become negative. 

  Approximately half of Australia's 1995-96 population growth rate was due to net  overseas migration. 

  Around 65 per cent of the 1995-96 net overseas migration was due to net permanent  movements while around 35 per cent was due to net long-term temporary  movements: 

  The long-term temporary people are predominantly working holiday makers,  overseas students and temporary skilled residents. 

  Net overseas migration to Australia has increased steadily since 1992-93 when it  was as low as 30,000. 

  In 1995-96, net overseas migration reached 114,000. 

  The increase since 1992-93 was due to a series of significant increases in the  immigration intake in the three years that followed as well as a steady rise in the  level of long-term temporary residents in Australia. 

  However, on the basis of the reduced intake announced by the Government for 1996-97, the ne permanent portion of net overseas migration is projected by the ABS to  decline in 1996-97 to 61,000 and to 56,000 in 1997-98. 

  It was around 70,000 in 1995-96. 

  From the projections produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, if the  permanent intake is held at around the current reduced levels, the rate of growth in  Australia's population will decline steadily. 

  The population is most likely to reach around 23 million in 25 to 35 years time and  would be growing only very slowly: 

  As I have said previously, I do believe that most Australians would not regard  that prospect with alarm although I am not suggesting that this is some kind  of population target that the Government intends to adopt; 

  As the NPC found, "population policy should be achieved not by specification  of any long-term optimum population number, since a large range of  determinants are subject to change". 

  So what are our population options? 

  The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee for Long-Term  Strategies titled "Australia's Population Carrying Capacity", the so-called 'Jones 

  97-4793 Page 5 

  Report' after its esteemed Chairman, provides a very useful starting point for  considering population options. 

  While the Jones Report acknowledges that "the search for an 'optimum' population  target or a 'magic figure' of a rubicon between safety and danger is chimerical", it  very usefully lists 6 options for long-term population change. 

  [Slide number 2] 

  The Report eventually rejects 2 of these options as "illusory , unattainable and  undesirable" and suggests that the remaining 4 are, in the Committee's VIew,  "politically and socially realistic". 

  The remaining 4 options are: 

  Option 1. Relatively high population growth with an eventual population,  presumably by around the middle of the next century or later , of around  30 to 50 million; 

  Option 2. Moderate population growth to a population of between 23 and 30  million; 

  Option 3. Population stabilisation at between 17 and 23 million; or 

  Option 4. Moderate to major population reduction at between 5 and 17 million. 

  Let's then assess these options 

  While the Jones Report does not indicate its criteria for deciding why these options  are 'politically and socially realistic', I personally find options 1 and 4 outside the  range of plausibility. 

  To achieve Option 4 by around the middle of next century would require that we  cease immigration altogether and possibly also pursue a policy of discouraging  fertility and/or encouraging higher levels of emigration. 

  I will come to immigration policy a little later but I think we can safely rule out  Option 4 on the same grounds that the Jones Report ruled out 2 other, even more  unlikely options. 

  Option 1 is at the other extreme. 

  To achieve Option 1 by the middle of next century would require an immigration  intake of more than double the current level, and/or require that Australia's fertility  levels increase significantly. 

  [Slide number 3] 

  I see little prospect of a rise in fertility levels ; 

  On current indications , Australia's fertility levels are likely to continue to decline as 

  97-4793 Page 6 

  people marry later in life and have fewer children. 

  Moreover, I agree with the NPC's view that "the role of government in the area of  fertility is only that of ensuring that couples are provided with the maximum extent  of informed choice in deciding whether or not they have children". 

  Certainly the Coalition has no intention of trying to influence fertility levels. Also, I  see no strong reasons why Australia should adopt a significantly higher level of  immigration: 

  While the Coalition is committed to an immigration intake that serves the  national interest in terms of our social, economic and humanitarian objectives ,  I see no need for the significant expansion of the intake that would be needed  to achieve option 1. 

  That leaves us with Options 2 and 3. 

  I am of the view that the lower end of Option 3 -that is around 17 million -and the  higher end of Option 2 -that is around 30 million -are also an unlikely outcome given  current circumstances. 

  As I mentioned earlier, based on projections of fertility, and the permanent  immigration intake also at or somewhat below current levels , Australia's population  is likely to reach 23 million in around 25 to 35 years time. 

  By that time, the rate of population growth will have slowed significantly. 

  In other words, the current direction of Australia's population is likely to see us with  a population in 25 to 35 years time at somewhere between the high end of Jones'  Option 3 and the low end of Option 2 and growing only very slowly at that time. 

  What we have to consider is whether Australia should be seeking to change this  broad direction , either to achieve a significantly higher population or a significantly  lower population . 

  My first reaction to this question is to ask whether there is evidence to suggest  Australia would in an overall sense, be better off with a significantly higher or  significantly lower population: 

  I am not aware of any evidence that provides a conclusive answer to this  question but I am quite happy to be persuaded otherwise. 

  My second reaction is that if it could be proved that we would be better off with a  significantly lower or higher population than the current directions suggest, whether  the social , environmental and economic costs involved in achieving this are  something we as a society would be prepared to bear. 

  I have my doubts whether Australians as a whole would be prepared to bear these  costs noting that immigration policy is generally accepted as the only practical tool  for influencing the directions of Australia's population. 

  97-4793 Page 7 

  With regard to immigration policy, I would note that there is relatively little  realisation of the limits to using immigration policy to influence the broad direction  of Australia's population. 

  This is something that I would now like to elaborate. 

  Immigration policy 

  The Government is committed to an immigration policy that does not discriminate on  the grounds of race, nationality, sex, religion, colour or creed. 

  In terms of the size and composition of the intake, we are guided by the principle that  immigration must serve the national interest in terms of Australia's social,  environmental, economic and humanitarian objectives. 

  We see no need for a significant expansion in the size of the intake above the current  reduced levels. 

  In any case, it is questionable whether we could afford some of the short-term costs  that would be involved even though I am aware that there can be long-term benefits. 

  Under current circumstances, the Coalition certainly has no intention of returning to  the high immigration intakes of the late 1980s or indeed of allowing large application  pipelines to build up in the more discretionary Independent and Concessional  Family categories as was the case under the previous Government. 

  [Slide number 4] 

  This would represent a deliberate policy of trying to influence Australia's long-term  population outcome. 

  In December 1995, the former Minister for Immigration is reported to have said that  we need to think big in terms of our population. 

  This view, together with his adoption of very low passmark levels in the Independent  and Concessional family categories (which is the most readily available means of  expanding the intake), should have been accompanied by a statement to the  Australian people on population policy. 

  The former Minister should have made clear why he believed that a much larger  population was appropriate for Australia and how a rapid increase in the population  growth rate was to be accommodated. 

  If any government adopts such an immigration policy, I believe that that government  should be obliged to develop a formal population policy. 

  Indeed, as Shadow Minister for Immigration I made this very point in the late 1980s. 

  While the Government may consider some further reductions in the intake, the idea  of a dramatic reduction is also unrealistic and would not be in Australia's interests. 

  97-4793 Page 8 

  I would say to those calling for a dramatic reduction in the intake -for example  adoption of policies such as zero net migration - that they need to examine the  components of the intake more closely as each of these components is designed to  meet very specific and very different needs. 

  The implications of a dramatic reduction in the intake need to be understood in terms  of these specific and different needs. 

  As a developed nation that is part of the international community, we maintain a  humanitarian intake that is appropriate to our role in sharing the international  burden of refugees. 

  While the size of this intake needs to be consistent with what we can accommodate  within budgetary constraints, polls have consistently shown that there is community  support for a reasonable sized humanitarian intake. 

  As a nation with almost 25 per cent of its population born overseas, as well as one  whose people travel extensively overseas and have international travellers come to  Australia, we will always have a family migration stream to cater particularly for  any overseas-born bona fides spouses and dependent children of Australians. 

  Most developed nations, including those without a formal immigration program,  have an on-going level of close family migration -that is spouses and dependent  children. 

  In Australia, almost 65 per cent of the family stream in 1995-96 was made up of the  spouses and dependent children of Australian citizens and permanent residents who  had chosen to marry someone from overseas. 

  In the more internationally mobile world in which we now live, a percentage of young  Australians will inevitably many people from overseas and will want to live with  their partners in Australia. 

  The immigration intake must cater for these people as long as the relationship is  genUIne. 

  However, the numbers in this stream need to be kept in balance and cannot be  allowed to dominate the overall intake. 

  To remain internationally competitive , we must ensure that our industries have  skilled employees. 

  These skills must, wherever possible , be obtained by training Australians. 

  However, there will be instances where urgently needed skills can only be obtained  from overseas. 

  Our immigration policies must be sufficiently flexible to enable industries to obtain  these people quickly and with minimum cost after checking that there are no  appropriately qualified Australian in the local labour market that could fill these  positions. 

  97-4793 Page 9 

  Our immigration intake should also be able to accommodate people with business  skills and capital who wish to settle in Australia. 

  We know from close monitoring of the Business Skills category, that these migrants  have a very good track record in setting up new businesses or revitalising existing  businesses. 

  Business migrants create significant numbers of new jobs, often In the  internationally tradeable goods and services sector. 

  Their contribution to our economic well being and competitiveness is substantial and  will continue to be so if we ensure that the integrity of the category is maintained. 

  Another important part of our immigration intake are New Zealanders who cam to  Australia under the Trans-Tasman Travel Agreement. 

  The free movement of people between the two countries has been a long-standing  arrangement that has benefited both countries in many different ways. 

  The Government sees no reason to abandon this arrangement. 

  To summarise then, the Government's position on immigration is to maintain the  overall intake at or slightly below the current relatively modest levels and to seek to  ensure an appropriate balance is maintained between the social, economic and  humanitarian objectives that immigration should serve. 

  Responsive aspects of population policy 

  There is a host of what the NPC described as the responsive aspects of population  policy that need to be considered. 

  These include: 

  The economic implication of a slowing rate of population growth; 

  The ageing of Australia's population; 

  The environmental impact of population; 

  The distribution of the population; and 

  The impact of a rising level of visitors, students and other temporary  residents. 

  Population and economic growth 

  There have been suggestions that a declining rate of population growth is something  that we should be alarmed about in terms of its implications for economic growth. 

  It is certainly true that population growth can fuel economic growth. 

  97-4793 Page 10 

  However, the more pertinent question is whether population growth is contributing  to an improved quality of life in Australia and a rising standard of living. 

  In terms of immigration led population growth, the consensus of expert economic  opinion seems to suggest a relatively neutral impact although this depends very  much on the extent to which the immigration intake has a skills and economic focus. 

  The experience of a number of developed countries with relatively low rates of  population growth but reasonable rates of economic growth -for example Japan -suggest that population growth is not essential to economic well-being. 

  I see no reason for alarm in Australia's slowing rate of population growth. 

  Ageing of the population 

  Australia's population is ageing as a result of declining birth rates and people living  longer. 

  However, this is not a new phenomenon. 

  Our population has been ageing for many years and will continue to do so for many  years to come. 

  Countries in Europe and Japan for example already have much older population  structures than Australia. 

  The key point about the ageing of the population is that, as the NPC found,  irrespective of any realistic level of migration, ageing will continue for the next forty  years. 

  It is something that we as a society must accept and learn to deal with. 

  The way to do this is to adopt policies that will ensure that as we age, we are not a  burden on our children . 

  Environmental impact of population 

  There is little doubt that, all other things being equal, a larger population is likely to  have a greater negative impact on the environment than a smaller population.  While Australia is well endowed in terms of natural resources, this is not something  that we can take for granted, particularly as the percentage of the continent that is 

  arable is relatively small. 

  However, we also need to keep this issue, important as it is, in perspective and in  balance. 

  We must remember that probably the most significant negative impact on  Australia's environment occurred in the 1800s when we had a much smaller  population. 

  97-4793 Page 11 

  Population size is not the only or even the most significant factor contributing to a  negative impact on the environment. 

  The key question is to what extent reductions in the immigration intake of various  levels, being the only realistic factor which the Government can use to influence  population levels, would contribute to a reduced negative impact on the  environmen t. 

  I suspect that the kinds of further reductions in the intake that could be made would  make relatively little difference in terms of long-term environmental impacts  compared to the benefits that can be achieved from small changes in the behaviour of  the whole population. 

  As long as the intake is not increased significantly above current levels, the focus  should be on our own behaviour and policies towards the environment. 

  Population distribution 

  Population in Australia is highly concentrated In a few major cities and  predominantly along coastal strips. 

  Over 65 per cent of the population lives in cities of more than 50,000 -the area of  these cities represents only 0.1 % of the land area of the continent. 

  There are major disparities between the population growth rates of different States  and Territories and the cities within these. 

  Population growth rates in the year to 31 March 1996 were fastest in: 

  Queensland, particularly south-east Queensland, which grew by some 2.5 per  cent; 

  Western Australia, particularly the area around Perth, which grew by some  1.8 per cent; and 

  The Northern Territory, particularly the area around Darwin, grew by around  2.2 per cent. 

  By comparison, the population of Tasmania was almost unchanged while the  population of South Australia grew by only 0.3 percent. 

  Although these relative growth rates reflect the impact of both internal and overseas  migration, NSW and Victoria continue to be the two major States for receiving new  immigran ts. 

  To some degree, these differences in population growth rates reflect the relative  strengths of the economies of the States and Territories and the availability of  employment. 

  While these factors will continue to dominate settlement location decisions by both  existing residents and new migrants, the smaller States and Territories are looking 

  97-4793 Page 12 

  to attract a higher percentage of skilled and business migrants as one of a number of  strategies to enhance economic development and jobs growth. 

  I have been eager to assist in this endeavour by developing immigration mechanisms  that individual States and Territories might use within the aggregate immigration  planning levels set by the Commonwealth. 

  I am aware, however, that these mechanisms can only ever make a modest  contribution and cannot succeed unless they are part of overall long-term State and  Territory development plans. 

  International visitors, students and temporary residents 

  Australia's visitor and temporary entry programs serve a number of vital Australian  interests. 

  International tourism is now a critical part of Australia's economy and contributed  some 14.1 billion dollars to Australia's export earnings in 1995-96. 

  This represented around 12.3 per cent of total export earnings. 

  In terms of jobs, we know that over 500,000 jobs in Australia are associated with  tourism, a considerable percentage of which are dependent on international tourism. 

  The overseas students industry is also becoming increasingly important to Australia. 

  It is currently valued at around 2.3 billion dollars annually and is expected to  increase in value to around 4 billion dollars annually by the year 2000. 

  The internationalisation of business, particularly the number of regional  headquarters of major international companies that have now been established in  Australia, means that business people are constantly moving into and out of  Australia. 

  While visitors and other temporary entrants deliver major economic and  employment benefits, they also have some negative impact on the environment. 

  The CSIRO through its Ecumene Project is looking to model these impacts. 

  This provide vital feedback to Government agencies at all levels with an interest in  these matters. 

  However, it is not clear that limiting numbers of visitors and other temporary  entrants is the optimum means of minimising the negative environmental impact. 

  It is more likely to be a question of better management of the impacts in order to  achieve a balanced outcome for the environment, the economy and employment. 

  Demographic framework for monitoring, anticipation and response 

  The NPC suggested that a critical element of a responsive population policy is the 

  97-4793 Page 13 

  development of a suitable demographic framework for monitoring anticipation and  response. 

  I strongly agree with the need for public availability of information on population  trends, prospects and impacts, both to inform the community of these important  matters, as well as to provide a critical ingredient to planning decisions. 

  Over the last few months, I have given great attention to promoting such  information, particularly through documents produced by my Department. These  include: 

  Population flows: Immigration aspects; 

  Settler Arrivals, and 

  Population Trends and Prospects. 

  Of course the Australian Bureau of Statistics also produces extensive material on  population including: 

  Long-range population projections that are updated regularly; and 

  Quarterly demographic statistics 

  Other Commonwealth agencies involved in monitoring, forecasting and reporting on  population issues include: 

  The annual State of the Environment Report by the Department of the  Environment which provides comprehensive environmental impact  assessments including the impact of the population; 

  Projections of the Australian Workforce by the Department of  Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs to the year 2005 provide  information on employment growth by occupation, numbers of people  undertaking different types of training and the supply and demand for  various skills; 

  The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare which makes projections of  the demand and supply of health professionals; 

  The Bureau of Tourism Research which provides projections of international  tourist number; and 

  Projections of housing demand and supply by the Indicative Planning Council. 

  A substantial and important amount of work on population forecasting at the State  and Territory level is currently being done by State and Territory Governments. 

  State and Territory departments of planning and urban development regularly  prepare reports on demographic and housing trends,and monitor land use and  population growth at the State, regional and local government levels. 

  97-4793 Page 14 

  They also coordinate planning on urban development and infrastructure and  produce projections of the population for the State capital city and each region and  local government area within the State, taking into account factors such as housing  trends, internal migration and land supply. 

  Recent State publications on population projections include: 

  Population Projections for NSW, 1991-2021 by the NSW Department of Urban  Affairs and Planning; and 

  Population Projections for Local Government Areas in Western Australia 1991-2011 by the Western Australian Planning Commission. 

  There is also an annual Commonwealth State Population Workshop at which  representatives of State/Territory planning departments discuss issues of mutual  interest with representatives of Commonwealth Government agencies with interest  in population matters. 

  A most interesting development in terms of our understanding of the long-term  impact of population is the CSIRO's Ecumene Project. 

  This project attempts to model the links between population, development and the  environment. 

  It will attempt to describe the impact of the human population on the Australian  environment in terms of a number of possible scenarios, including different levels of  net migration and the spatial distribution of the population. 

  I intend to obtain a more detailed briefing on this project from the CSIRO shortly and  will be following the results of the project with great interest. 

  Summary 

  To summarise, the key points I would like to leave you with are that: 

  The natural rate of population growth for Australia is projected to decline over  the next 50 years; 

  If immigration is held at or somewhat below the current very modest levels  (and there are very practical limits to how far immigration can be reduced or  increased), Australia's population is likely to be around 23 million in 25 to 35  years and growing only very slowly; 

  While I do not view this as a target, it is a likely outcome of current  demographics and current directions in immigration policy; and 

  While I do not view this as a target, it is a likely outcome of current  demographics and current direction in immigration policy; and 

  It is a prospect that I believe most Australians would regard as reasonable.
