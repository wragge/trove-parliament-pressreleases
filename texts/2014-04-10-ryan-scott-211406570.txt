 Outstanding young Australians recognised in 2014  National Youth Awards 

 Thursday 10 April 2014 Media Release    

 Senator the Hon Scott Ryan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education today  announced the winners of the 2014 National Youth Awards at a presentation dinner at the  National Gallery of Australia. 

 “The National Youth Awards recognise and celebrate the achievements of Australia’s young  people,” Senator Ryan said. 

 “The unique aspect of the Awards is that the finalists and winners are selected by a panel of  young people. This means the finalists were judged by a panel of their peers.” 

 There are seven Award categories - Health and Wellbeing, Creating Pathways, Community  Leadership, Safer Communities, Personal Courage, Cultural Understanding and Positive  Media. 

 This year’s winners in their respective categories are: 

 ï· Health and wellbeing:  Northern Territorian Evelyna Dhamarrandji, for her work  establishing a programme to engage Indigenous women aged 17-30 years in fitness,  healthy eating and good mental health. 

 ï· Creating Pathways:  Victorian Jonathan Brown, who gives young Australians access  to media platforms to help change the way they are represented in the media. This  includes providing media training and educational support via Radio Adelaide. 

 ï· Community Leadership Award: Western Australian Conrad Liveris, an advocate  and actor supporting diversity and disadvantaged Australians. Conrad co-founded  Street Smugglers, an initiative to link homeless people with services. 

 ï· Safer Communities Award: New South Wales’ Jayde Ellis, an advocate for sexual  and gender diversity who led the development of ‘Wear it Purple’ awareness day. The  awareness day is now a fully-fledged national campaign. 

 ï· Personal Courage Award: Queenslander Tylah Schmidt, who having experienced  the negative effects of bullying, developed a video presentation based on her  experience. The video has been well received and will be used in community anti-bullying campaigns. 

 ï· Cultural Understanding Award: New South Wales’ Arif Khan, a young Afghan-Australian refugee committed to helping culturally diverse and disadvantaged people.  Arif has established a media webpage to address cultural issues, which is now  followed by 4000 Australians. 

 ï· Positive Media Award: The winning article was ‘The Truth is Out There’ by  Victorian Jo Davy. The article appeared in the lifestyle and property magazine The  Weekly Review. Jo writes news features at the magazine and enjoys interviewing  fascinating people. 

 Senator Ryan said the awards reflect this year’s National Youth Week theme ‘Our Voice. Our  Impact.’ 

 “This theme was chosen by the young members of the National Planning Group after they  received suggestions from young Australians. 

 “Each of tonight’s winners, the finalists and all the young Australians involved in Youth  Week can be proud that their voices are being heard through the contributions they are  making to their communities,” Senator Ryan said.
