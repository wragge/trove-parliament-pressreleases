  SENIOR U~ OFFICIAL TO HEAD REFUGEE REVIEW TRIBUNAL 

  A senior United Nations official with personal experience in human rights and refugee  issues has been appointed the new Principal Member of Australia's Refugee Review  Tribunal. 

  The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus, said Mr Shun  Chetty would take up the position early next year for a term of five years. Mr Chetty is  currently based in Geneva as the Deputy Director of the United Nations High  Commission for Refugees' (UNHCR) Regional Bureau for Asia and Oceania. 

  "Mr Chetty has a personal understanding of the trauma which is part of the refugee  experience," Senator Bolkus said. "He was a lawyer in South Africa between 1974 and  1979, during which time he represented opponents of apartheid and was the instructing  attorney in the Steve Biko inquest. Mr Chetty was arrested and subjected to sustained  harassment and was required to leave South Africa for his own safety." 

  Senator Bolkus said Mr Chetty was an outstanding appointment with a high personal  profile as a result of his activities in South Africa and with the United Nations. "I think  his appointment will be widely welcomed and will add stature to the important office to  which he has been appointed," he said. 

  Mr Chetty, aged 54, was born in South Africa and has extensive government and legal  experience including more than 15 years with the UNHCR. His appointments include  Legal Adviser for Asia based in Bangkok in 1985-86 and Head of Mission in Beijing in  1989-90. In 1990-92 Mr Chetty worked in Genev?- as Deputy Director of the UNHCR's  Division of International Protection. 

  Mr Chetty succeeds Professor Leroy Certoma who resigned on 23 August 1995. 

  "I would like once again to thank Professor Certoma on his contribution as founding  Principal Member of the Refugee Review Tribunal," Senator Bolkus said. 

  Mr Murray Gerkens, the member administrator, will continue to be acting Principal  Member until Mr Chetty takes up his appointment.
