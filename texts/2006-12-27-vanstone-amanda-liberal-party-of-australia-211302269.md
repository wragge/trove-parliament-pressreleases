 Migrants head to the West 

 27 December 2006 

 Increasing numbers of migrants are choosing Western Australia to set up home, with settler  numbers at their highest since the Coalition came to government. 

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Amanda Vanstone today said 17 638 migrants  settled in the West in 2005-2006, up from 16 318 in the previous year. 

 ‘Migrants have voted with their feet to move to Western Australia and begin their new lives,  which is a remarkable vote of confidence in the state,’ Senator Vanstone said. 

 ‘The Western Australian community is to be congratulated for welcoming these people into their  lives so readily and willingly.’ 

 More than 6700 United Kingdom settlers led the charge to Western Australia, while other  source countries included Sudan with 441 new settlers, Singapore with 936, Malaysia with 751,  India with 558 and South Africa with 1086. 

 On the national front, more than 131 000 people arrived and settled in Australia in 2005-2006,  an increase of about 8000 on the previous year. 

 The largest number of settlers came from the United Kingdom with 23 290, up by about 5000  on last year. 

 Other European countries contributed about 7000 migrants, while the number of new arrivals  from Sudan fell almost 2000 from the last year to 3783. 

 Iraqi arrival numbers were up almost 500 to 2425, while more than 52 000 people from 34  Asian countries made Australia their new home during 2005-2006. 

 Senator Vanstone said the majority of new arrivals entered Australia through the family and  skill streams of the migration programme. 

 ‘Our migration target for 2006-2007 is about 140 000, including 97 500 in the skill stream and  that number does not include the 13 000 refugee and humanitarian entrants who will begin  new lives in Australia through our humanitarian programme.’     

 The full list of statistics can be found in Settler Arrivals 2005-2006, a Department of  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs publication that has been published on its website at  www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/index.htm.
