 Mr Michael Organ MP   

 RUDDOCK MUST GO   

 Cunningham MP Michael Organ says Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock's continual  mismanagement of the asylum seeker issue renders him unfit to hold Ministerial office.   

 "The revelations in last night's 'Four Corners' program on ABC-TV are deeply shocking  to any fair-minded person", Mr. Organ said.   

 "The claims of deliberate understaffing by Australian Correctional Management at the  Woomera detention centre, and the appalling toll that took on detainees, must have been  known to Ruddock's department.  As the Minister responsible, he should have taken  action to ensure that basic human rights were accorded to those unfortunate people; he  did not do so."   

 "Even today he is unapologetic, hiding behind suggestions that the claims stem from an  industrial dispute, and telling his Department to investigate itself over claims of fraud  allegedly perpetrated by ACM, the Australian arm of the U.S. Wackenhut Corporation."   

 "This Minister is the same man who was a party to the lies told to the Australian people  in the infamous 'children overboard' affair", Mr. Organ said.   

 "Ruddock's actions have stained our nation's reputation as a fair and compassionate  society.  He should resign forthwith, and if he doesn't the Prime Minister should sack  him."
