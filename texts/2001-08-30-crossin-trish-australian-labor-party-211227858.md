 Removal Allowance Must Be FBT Exempt For Coonawarra Naval Base Residents

  

 Northern Territory Labor Senator, Trish Crossin has called on the Federal Minister, Bruce Scott to exempt the removal allowance paid to those ADF personnel choosing to relocate from HMAS Coonawarra from the Fringe Benefits Tax reporting requirements.

  

 Senator Crossin said married couples at HMAS Coonawarra Naval Base had been given the option of moving off base due to the establishment of an unauthorised boat arrivals processing centre at the base.

  

 “While they have been told they will receive a rental allowance and a removals allowance if they choose to move off base, they still have not received clear advice on whether the removal allowance would be a reportable fringe benefit.

  

 “I have had a number of calls from personnel living at HMAS Coonawarra who have received conflicting advice on whether the removals allowance would be a reportable item or not.

  

 “The reporting of the removal allowance has the potential to financially impact on ADF personnel by up to $5000 a year through reductions in family allowance benefits and increases to income assessed payments such as child support payments.

  

 “My office has been in contact with the relevant Federal Minister, Bruce Scott, and all we’ve been able to find out is that they are still trying to work out whether the removal allowance should be subject to Fringe Benefits Tax reporting requirements. They couldn’t even inform us when a decision would be made.

  

 “Well frankly, that is not good enough. How can those families living on HMAS Coonawarra make up their minds as to whether they can afford to move off base if they don’t know what are the cost implications.

  

 “Given the unique circumstances I would urge Minister Scott to issue an immediate statement that the removal allowance for those personnel choosing to move of base would be exempt from the Fringe Benefits Tax reporting requirements.

  

 “The Labor Party’s position is clear. The removal allowance should be exempt or FBT purposes.

  

 “Come on, Minister Scott - the lack of consultation with HMAS Coonawarra residents about the establishment of the unauthorised boat arrivals processing centre was bad enough.

  

 “Surely now at least you can ensure that it doesn’t cost those service personnel to move off-base due to the establishment of the processing centre,” Senator Crossin said.
