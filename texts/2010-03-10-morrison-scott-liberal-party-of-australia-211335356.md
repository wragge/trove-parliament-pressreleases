 TEST OF PEOPLE SMUGGLING AGREEMENT WILL BE WHETHER IT STOPS  THE BOATS 

 Mr Scott Morrison MP  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 The success of an any agreement on people smuggling with Indonesia announced by the Rudd Government will 

 be judged on just one criteria - whether it stops the boats, according to Shadow Minister for Immigration and 

 Citizenship, Scott Morrison.  

 “International and regional cooperation will always be critical in the fight against people smuggling, but it is not a 

 substitute for Kevin Rudd to avoid addressing his own domestic policy failings that have created a viable product 

 for people smugglers to trade,” Mr Morrison said.  

 “While any agreement on people smuggling is welcome, the test will be whether it stops the boats. This is a 

 judgement Kevin Rudd will be unable to avoid,” he said.  

 “Since Kevin Rudd started rolling back the Coalition’s strong border protection regime in August 2008, there have 

 been 88 illegal boat arrivals carrying more than 4000 people.  

 “So far this year there have been 20 illegal boat arrivals carrying more than 1050 people, at a rate of more than 9 

 per month, 25% higher than the previous highest record in 1999.  

 “Any real discussion with Indonesia should begin with Kevin Rudd making a commitment to reverse his own 

 policy failings that are acting as a magnet for people smuggling.  

 “Kevin Rudd must also develop some real resolve on this issue, rather than the phony posturing we typically see 

 as a substitute for real action.  

 “A key example of action speaking louder than words was when the Rudd Government did their special deal for 

 the 78 passengers on the Oceanic Viking. Since then 40 boats have arrived.  

 “Instead of blaming everyone else, the Prime Minister should follow the Coalition’s lead and implement policies 

 that will actually stop the boats.  

 “This will be the true measure of success of any people smuggling agreement with Indonesia,” Mr Morrison said.
