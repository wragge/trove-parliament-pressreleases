 E&OE  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Unlike Labor, we have a plan for national recovery; one that will build the foundations  for Australia to recover with more jobs, with less debt, with real growth after this  downturn ceases. We have a plan for the future. Mr Swan seems to be just  apologising for more debt, bigger deficits, higher taxes. There is no coherence from  the Government in terms of its economic strategy. On the one hand, they’re handing  out cash like Santa Claus. On the other hand, they’re promising cut backs on vital  services and benefits for pensioners and benefits for self-funded retirees and  benefits under Medicare. Right across the board, this Government is promising a  confused economic message. They don’t know whether they’re spending, spending  big - they certainly are spending big - or whether they’re going to be cutting back.  They’re threatening to do that. There is no consistency; no plan. We have a plan for  national recovery.  

 I just want to say something else on another matter. There has been another boat of  unlawful asylum seekers picked up today. It’s the 19th boat since August since Labor  changed our border protection policies and this brings the total to 729. Now that is  nearly three times, three times the total number of arrivals as compared to what we  received in the previous six years. So in the nine months since August we’ve had  729, nearly three times as many arrivals as we had in the previous six years. Now  Labor’s border protection policy has failed. There can’t be any serious argument  about that now. It has failed to stop the dreadful business of people smuggling. Now  we know that the people smugglers have received the message that our policies or  Mr Rudd’s policies are soft and that we’ve become a soft target. We’ve heard it from  their potential passengers in Indonesia. We’ve heard it from the Indonesian  Ambassador. We’ve heard it from the International Organization for Migration. We’ve  been told that the Federal Police advised the Rudd Government that the change in  policies would have this effect.  

 Now we’ve asked Mr Rudd to have an independent inquiry into this policy failure. He  says this increase in arrivals has got nothing to do with the change in policy. He’s  entitled to say that but nobody accepts it and it defies common sense. What is he  afraid of an independent inquiry discovering? He should have the inquiry and then  the Australian people will know precisely who is responsible for this dramatic  increase in people smuggling.  

 QUESTION:  

 Mr Turnbull on that note, Bronwyn Bishop is quoted in The Manly Daily today saying  that you’ve gone soft on people smugglers. Do you think that that’s true?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Everyone knows I take a very strong position on all of these issues, be it border  protection, be it debt, be it protecting Australian jobs from a poorly designed and ill  thought out emissions trading scheme. The Coalition projects strength and  commitment. We are the ones that are standing up for Australia, standing up for  Australian jobs.  

 QUESTION:  

 With regard to the deficit, what level would you term as irresponsible?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 We need to see the budget papers next week. We just heard Mr Swan on the  television pleading with the Coalition to tell him what our budget would look like. Well  of course he’s got to produce his budget first and then, as one of the journalists  pointed out in the room, he’s got to produce his budget first and then we reply two  days later. So we’ve got to see what the numbers are.  

 The real problem with Mr Swan’s approach to this is that he says if you accept there  should be any deficit then you should accept a deficit of any level; if you agree that  the Commonwealth should borrow money then you agree that it should borrow any  amount of money. Now, Australians are not as silly as Mr Swan takes us for being.  The fact is, we know that every dollar the Commonwealth borrows, every dollar it  goes into deficit, has to be done in a way that delivers real value for Australians and  for taxpayers. They want to see something for this borrowing.  

 Now, what we’ve seen since the Rudd Government embarked on this spending  spree last October, is what we’ve seen, $23 billion borrowed and given away. And  what have we seen for that? Not a road, not a hospital, not a bridge, not a port, not a  railway, nothing. It’s just been given away, massive debt just given away in cheques  of $900 and $1,000 dollars.  

 So that’s really what Mr Swan and Mr Rudd have got to answer. What is the  message they are giving to Australians? It’s this Jekyll and Hyde approach. Is it the  extravagant Dr Jekyll handing out money left, right and centre - everybody getting a  cheque? Or is it mean Mr Hyde - clawing things back, depriving people of vital  services? They’re in a state of confusion and that undermines confidence and of  course it provides all Australians with a very deep concern that our ability to recover  from this downturn, our ability to spring out of this period of recession is going to be  hindered and held back by an unsustainable level of Labor debt.  

 QUESTION:  

 What’s your reaction to the latest Newspoll?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Look, everybody else in Australia, or everyone else in the political world, comments  on opinion polls but I choose to leave it to everybody else. The only poll I’m focused  on is the poll on Election Day and that’s a way off yet.  

 QUESTION:  

 What do you make of the Reserve Bank’s announcement today [inaudible] a wait-and-see approach?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well, I think it’s heartening in that the Reserve Bank is seeing signs of recovery. It’s  a cautious statement. They’re seeing signs of recovery around the world. They  particularly identified signs of growth in China, which is obviously very important to  us, and so they’ve, you know, they’ve got a steady-as-she-goes policy and they have  held rates steady and I think that should be seen as an encouraging sign by  Australians.  

 QUESTION:  

 Just back to the deficit. The Rudd Government keeps bandying about this term  ‘temporary deficit’. Is that a ridiculous notion?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well, Mr Swan said today that his temporary deficit was going to go on for a long  time. And the real question for Mr Swan to answer is when does a long-running,  temporary deficit become a long-term deficit? Really, he’s got to get his terms right.  There doesn’t sound as though there’s anything temporary about this deficit. And, in  fact, I have very grave doubts - very, very grave doubts - whether Mr Swan or Mr  Rudd will ever preside over a surplus budget. The way they are spending, the way  they are borrowing, the lack of discipline they’re displaying should give us no  confidence at all that they would be capable of returning the Budget to surplus.  Okay, thanks so much.
