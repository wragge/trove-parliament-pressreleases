 Greens Condemn Nauru, Solomon Islands Support for  Japanese Whaling Win 

 Senator Siewert, 20th June 2006 

 "The Minister for the Environment Ian Campbell owes Australia an explanation for  Nauru and the Solomon Islands' key role in Japan's win on a motion for the  International Whaling Commission to prioritise the consideration of commercial  whaling", Greens Spokesperson Rachel Siewert said today. 

 "It is outrageous that Canberra has failed to get Nauru and the Solomon Islands on-side for this crucial vote." "This motion tips the balance for future world meetings on  whaling from conservation to commercial whaling," Senator Siewert said. 

 In the Senate today, Greens Leader Bob Brown attacked Senator Campbell's failure to  stop Nauru and the Solomon Islands from backing Japan against Australia. 

 "How come Senator Campbell has failed to get these nations on side?" 

 "How come the Government has got Nauru to take West Papuan refugees but can't get  Nauru to stop Japan taking whales from Antarctica?" he asked.
