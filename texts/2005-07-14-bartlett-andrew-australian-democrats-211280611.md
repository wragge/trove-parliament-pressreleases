 More Than Just a Culture Change Required

 Democrats Deputy Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, says the Federal Government  continues to deny its own culpability in the immigration mess and is trying to shift the  blame onto public servants for having the wrong culture. 

 "The fact is, it is the law and the policy which informs that culture," Senator Bartlett said.  "And until that changes, all we will have is better administration of an unjust law which by  definition still produces injustices."

 In his report, released today, former federal police chief Mick Palmer found that DIMIA  operates with "instructions and requirements that inhibit or prevent effective performance,  rather than facilitate it". 

 "The most important of those "instructions and requirements" are the Migration Act, and  the Governments policy on how it should be implemented," Senator Bartlett said. 

 "Given the Government is continuing to ignore its own responsibilities and refusing to  commit to fix the situation, or call a Royal Commission to have a proper examination, it will  be up to the Senate Inquiry that is now underway to come up with solutions to once again  give Australia a functional and fair migration regime."

 "Mr Palmer makes clear at the outset that his report is not intended to call the  (Governments immigration) policy into question. This is appropriate, as the inquirys terms  of reference do not enable the adequacy of the policy or the law to be examined," Senator  Bartlett said. "However, it also means that his findings are unavoidably limited."

 "Despite this major constraint, his findings still reveal a total system breakdown and are so  damning, that it is clear that only a significant change in the policy and the law can  address them," Senator Bartlett concluded.
