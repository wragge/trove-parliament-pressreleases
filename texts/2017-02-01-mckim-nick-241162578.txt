 Media Release: End the US impasse, bring refugees to Australia   

 February 1, 2017   

 Malcolm Turnbull should end the uncertainty and confusion over the US refugee "deal"  and bring the people to Australia, Greens Immigration spokesperson Nick McKim says.   

 "It is now clear that the US deal relies on an unhinged, dishonest President," Senator  McKim said.   

 "People should be very concerned about what Mr Turnbull is prepared to do to get this  deal done."   

 "As we now know, the deal does not commit the US to accept a single person."   

 "Refugees are people, not political bargaining chips, and the men, women and children  in offshore detention remain Australia's responsibility."   

 "Having suffered so greatly at Australia's hands, they do not deserve more months of  uncertainty and angst."   

 "The easiest way to end the impasse is to bring them here."
