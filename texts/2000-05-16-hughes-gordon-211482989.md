 “Nuclear Testing to National Regulation:  A Broad Legal Agenda”

 WRITTEN VERSION ONLY.  CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY

 Introduction

 Mr Chairman, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen

 The  topic  of  my  speech  today—Nuclear  Testing  to  National  Regulation—

 demonstrates the diverse areas in which the Law Council is working at the turn of

 the century.

 It  reflects  the  fact  that  today’s  legal  profession,  chiefly  through  its  professional

 associations,  is  playing  a  strong  role  not  only  in  undertaking  reform  of  its  own

 practices, and that of the justice system.  The legal profession is also advocating

 the Australian community’s interests on a wide range of broader legal issues.

 The Law Council plays no role as a regulator of lawyers—rather it is the national

 representative group for approximately 38000 practising lawyers in Australia.

 In that capacity, it has increasingly provided a respected voice, and leadership,

 on issues relating to justice system and legal profession reform.  The Council has

 led  the  legal  profession  through  a  rapidly  changing  national  and  international

 environment,  which  has  seen  the  basic  structures  of  traditional  legal  practice

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 3/24

 being  scrutinised  in  light  of  national  and  multi-national  mergers,  and  the

 increasing globalisation of legal practice.

 But the Council has also provided a strong voice on wider, legal-social issues, on

 both  the  national  and  international  stages,  such  as  mandatory  sentencing,

 immigration  and  refugee  decision-making  processes,  drug  control,  French

 nuclear  testing  in  the  Pacific  in  1995,  and  advocacy  of  the  fundamental

 maintenance of the Rule of Law in overseas countries.

 Today,  I  will  discuss  the  Law  Council’s  most  recent  work  in  both  fields  of  its

 responsibility,  and  I  will  signal  a  major  step  forward  in  the  structure  and

 regulation of our profession.

 Justice System and Legal Profession Reform

 Let me first begin with justice system and legal profession reform.

 As the national representative body for the legal profession, the Law Council has

 always played a key role in this area, and recently it has been closely involved

 with—and  regularly  supported—the  Federal  Government’s  reform  initiatives  for

 both the civil and criminal law systems.

 In respect of civil law, the Australian Law Reform Commission has just this year

 completed its substantial, four year Inquiry into the Federal Civil Justice System,

 which  has  put  forward  many  suggestions  for  the  reform  of  the  legal  profession

 and the federal civil justice system.  The Law Council made a significant number

 of  submissions  to  the  Inquiry,  and  supports  many  of  the  reform  suggestions

 posed.  It will work actively with the Federal Government and the federal courts

 to implement the mooted changes over the next few years.

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 4/24

 Regarding  criminal  law,  the  Council  has—amongst  other  reform  initiatives—

 worked closely with the Directors of Public Prosecutions and the Directors of the

 legal  aid  commissions  to  establish  principles  for  the  reform  of  pre-trial  criminal

 procedure, particularly by the prosecution, in order to reduce unnecessary court

 time and client costs.

 But the primary focus of the Council’s policy work at present lies in facilitating the

 evolution of a truly national profession.

 National Cooperation Project

 The trigger for much of the Law Council’s legal profession reform work has been

 the  National  Competition  Policy  review,  a  fixture  on  the  landscape  of  the

 professions and the wider business community since 1995.

 This, in turn, gave rise to the Law Council’s National Cooperation Project, which

 has sought to develop a wholly national approach to the operation and structure

 of  the  Australian  legal  profession,  and  to  enhance  competition  within  the

 profession.

 In December 1998, the Law Council adopted three important policy positions on

 three issues stemming from the National Competition Policy review—these were

 policies in relation to multi-disciplinary practices, the reservation of legal work for

 lawyers, and federal professional standards legislation.

 Each  of  these  policies  has,  as  its  central  tenet,  the  protection  of  consumers’

 interests  and the  primacy of  maintenance  of  legal  ethics  and  accountability.   In

 relation to the reservation of legal work for lawyers, the Council has adopted the

 stance that it is only core areas of legal work for which the consumer-interest is

 best served by having a lawyer undertake the work.

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 5/24

 Other aspects of the National Cooperation project include the consideration and

 reform  of  fidelity  funds,  the  development  of  uniform  national  admission

 requirements,  the  development  of  uniform  trust  accounting  legislation,  and  the

 ongoing  development  and  introduction  of  uniform  model  professional  conduct

 rules.

 A National Legal Services Market

 The  linchpin  of  the  Law  Council’s  National  Cooperation  Project  has  been  the

 active  development  of  a  national  ‘travelling’  practising  certificate  scheme  for

 lawyers.

 In  1994,  the  Law Council  developed  its  Blueprint  for  a  National  Legal  Services

 Market—its  fundamental  basis  was  that  a  lawyer  admitted  to  practice  in  any

 State  or  Territory  should  be  able  to  practise  law  throughout  Australia  with  few

 restrictions.

 The national ‘travelling’ practising certificate scheme, when fully implemented in

 all States and Territories of Australia, will permit a form of national practice.  This

 will  bring  significant  benefits  for  lawyers’  clients,  who  often  require  legal

 assistance or advice across State borders.  It will also benefit lawyers, who will

 no longer need separate practising certificates in all jurisdictions.

 The  Law Council has  been  working since  1996  to  have  legislation  effecting the

 scheme implemented in each State and Territory.

 At present, the legislation has been implemented in New South Wales, the ACT,

 Victoria and South Australia.  The Law Council understands that in the Northern

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 6/24

 Territory  and  Tasmania,  introduction  of  the  legislation  is  imminent.   Western

 Australia is hopefully also introducing its legislation this year.

 Queensland,  however,  has  been  slower  to  support  adoption  of  the  scheme.   It

 has  been  considering  the  scheme  as  one  part  of  a  wider  Queensland

 Government  reform  agenda  for  the  legal  profession  which  initially  proposed

 radical  reforms  to  the  regulatory  and  disciplinary  systems  governing  legal

 practitioners in Queensland.

 The Law Council will continue to encourage the Queensland Government, and its

 two  legal  professional  associations,  to  implement  the  scheme,  given  the

 significant  benefits  it  would  bring  to  legal  consumers  and  lawyers  not  only  in

 Queensland, but elsewhere in Australia.

 The Need for National Regulation

 Whilst the national ‘travelling’ practising certificate scheme is a good example of

 one  part  of  national  cooperation,  it  will  none-the-less  leave  intact  the  disparate

 schemes of State and Territory-based regulation and discipline of lawyers.

 The question arises—is national regulation of lawyers feasible, achievable and, if

 so, really necessary?

 In  answering  this  question,  the  significant  changes  occurring  in  the  legal

 profession’s landscape in Australia must be considered.

 Australia  has  a  large  proportion  of  small,  regional  firms  and  sole  practitioners.

 The  larger  firms  have  begun  to  set  their  sights  on  truly  national  and  global

 partnerships.

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 7/24

 Some of the top-tier and middle-tier firms, which historically were based on State

 partnerships  loosely  joined  together  to  form  national  groups,  are  now  fully

 nationally-integrated partnerships.

 With this development, I believe it is logical to consider whether it is realistic, or

 outmoded, to have lawyers still being regulated on a State and Territory basis.

 Currently, there are regulatory discrepancies between the States and Territories

 as to:

 â¢ the decision-making processes for who should be admitted to practise law;

 â¢ the ethical standards lawyers should maintain;

 â¢ what disciplinary proceedings should be taken against those lawyers who do

 not uphold those standards;

 â¢ what content—and how—law students should be taught; and

 â¢  what  controls  and  requirements  should  be  placed  on  fidelity  funds  and

 uniform trust accounts.

 Last  year,  the  Australian  Law  Reform  Commission  raised  for  consideration  a

 national regulatory body in order to overcome such regulatory differencesi.  Since

 then, several of the Law Council’s constituent bodies have signalled that there is

 a  need  for  a  body  to  become  responsible  for  nationally  regulating  the  legal

 profession.

 The  Law  Council  has  not  yet  developed  a  firm  policy  on  this  issue.   Its  2010

 Taskforce—which  is  charged  with  anticipating  the  future  of  the  legal  profession

 and the law further into the 21st Century—is currently considering it.

 It is also due to be discussed at next month’s meeting of the Law Council, where

 initial consideration will be given to possible national regulatory models.

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 8/24

 Understandably,  there  are  many  complex  and  entrenched  issues  which  arise

 when  considering  national  regulation  and,  for  that  reason  particularly,  I  predict

 that various stages of regulation would need to be considered.

 Issues which would require close consideration would include:

 â¢  Constitutional  questions  and  limitations  arising  from  the  Commonwealth

 Government’s power and ability to nationally regulate the profession;

 â¢  the  structure  within  which  national  regulation  would  occur,  particularly

 whether any State-based regulatory activity would need to be retained;

 â¢  the  pivotal  and  fundamental  role  which  the  State  and  Territory  Supreme

 Courts  currently  play  in  admitting  legal  practitioners  to  practise  in  their

 jurisdictions, and the supervisory disciplinary role the Courts have in deciding

 which practitioners should be prevented from practising;

 â¢ the likelihood that, in establishing a national regulator, a referral of power from

 the States to the Commonwealth under Section 51 (xxxvii) of the Constitution

 would probably be required, with significant cooperation needed between the

 Commonwealth, State and Territory governments to effect this;

 â¢  the  question  of  funding  for  a  national  regulator,  given  that  the  current  State

 regulatory regimes often involve unique funding arrangements, with the cost

 of  regulatory  activities  supplemented  by  solicitors’  trust  account  allocations,

 State Government appropriations, and practising lawyers’ contributions.

 These issues cannot be resolved quickly and require extensive consultation with

 all  the  interested  participants,  including  the  Attorneys-General  (through  SCAG),

 the Supreme Courts, the State and Territory law associations and, of course, the

 profession as a whole.

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 9/24

 A  first  step  which,  in  my  view,  may  be  achievable  in  the  relatively  short-to-medium  term,  is  defining  those  areas  essential  for  national  practice,  and

 establishing a register of solicitors entitled to practise nationally.  Personally, I am

 keen  for  progress  to  be  made  in  this  area.   Such  an  approach  would  build  on,

 and develop, the work the Law Council has already undertaken for the national

 ‘travelling’ practising certificate scheme.

 The  State  and  Territory  legal  professional  bodies,  Governments  and  Courts

 would continue to be responsible for regulating lawyers’ compliance with agreed

 uniform standards.

 The areas most essential for national practice would seem to be:

 â¢ uniform entry standards for admission to legal practice;

 â¢ uniform professional indemnity insurance, minimum cover and terms of cover;

 â¢ uniform fidelity cover and terms of cover;

 â¢ uniform trust account requirements;

 â¢ uniform professional standards schemes which apply to federal law;

 â¢ the introduction of a proportionate liability regime for legal practitioners, rather

 than joint and several liability;

 â¢  the  ability  to  operate  nationally  through  a  variety  of  optional  business

 structures; and

 â¢ the establishment of a national register of practising lawyers.

 If the Law Council were disposed to go down this route, then a detailed proposal

 would need to be developed for the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General.

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 10/24

 Opening-up International Legal Markets

 Whilst the Law Council has led the way in structural reform of the Australian legal

 profession, it has simultaneously worked to facilitate the practice of foreign law in

 Australia, and to encourage overseas governments to allow Australian lawyers to

 practise Australian law in their countries.

 In  1992,  the  Law  Council  developed  a  policy  statement  on  international  legal

 practice,  which  set  down  a  recommended  regime  for  the  uniform  national

 regulation of foreign lawyers providing foreign law services in Australia.

 SCAG subsequently developed a Model  Practice  of Foreign  Law  Bill,  based  on

 the Law Council’s policy statement, for effecting a uniform regime in each State

 and Territory.

 The Council’s rationale in driving this reform has been two-fold.

 Firstly, both Australian and overseas consumers will benefit from having access

 to lawyers able to practise their laws within Australia, under appropriate national

 regulation.

 Secondly,  by  Australia  opening  its  doors  to  foreign  lawyers,  reciprocal

 arrangements  should  be  more  easily  obtained,  allowing  Australian  lawyers  to

 practise Australian law overseas.  This will be of significant benefit to companies

 and  individuals  requiring advice  on  Australian  law overseas,  and  it will  broaden

 the market for Australia’s lawyers and law firms.

 Legislation effecting the Model Practice of Foreign Law Bill has been enacted in

 the  ACT,  New  South  Wales,  Victoria  and  the  Northern  Territory.   The  other

 jurisdictions  need  to  enact  the  enabling  legislation  sooner  rather  than  later,  to

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 11/24

 make  the  uniform  regulation  of  foreign  lawyers  a  reality  in  Australia.   This  will

 greatly  assist  us  with  encouraging  the  liberalisation  of  foreign  markets  for

 Australian lawyers.

 The  Law  Council  and  the  Federal  Attorney-General  (with  the  assistance  of  the

 International  Legal  Services  Advisory  Council)  continue  to  cultivate  close

 relationships  with  governments  and  legal  associations  within  the  Asia-Pacific

 region particularly, to encourage foreign lawyers to practise their law in Australia,

 and to encourage the relaxation of market access barriers for Australian lawyers

 seeking to practise overseas.

 In  July last  year,  the  Federal Attorney-General led  a  very successful Australian

 Legal Services  Mission  to  China  and Thailand,  and  this  mission  resulted  in  the

 Chinese  Government  granting  two  further  licences  to  Australian  law  firms  to

 practise in China.

 While  there  have  been  such  successes,  there  are  other  markets,  such  as

 Singapore and Japan, where market access rights still remain relatively rigid, and

 where considerably more work is required to persuade a relaxation of barriers.

 Uniformity of Laws

 As the Law Council is considering a move to full national regulation of Australian

 lawyers, it is becoming increasingly obvious that there is an urgent need for the

 development of more uniform laws amongst Australia’s States and Territories.

 We  currently  see  a  lack  of  uniformity  in  laws  as  diverse  as  those  relating  to

 defamation, de facto relationships, real estate, crime and business.

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 12/24

 The  lack  of  uniformity  is  plainly  cumbersome  and  inefficient  for  the  Australian

 community, Australian business and the Australian economy.

 The  most  recent  example  of  the  imperative  for  more  constitutionally  sound

 national laws has been demonstrated in the Corporations Law field, following the

 High Court’s Re Wakimii decision last year.

 This  decision  found  to  be  constitutionally  invalid  a  scheme  which  had  been

 initially  established  to  address  the  many  problems  that  arose  from  having

 multiple jurisdictions in Australia.

 The decision has led to major uncertainty in the Corporations Law area.

 It  has  essentially  stripped  the  Federal  Court  of  most  of  its  jurisdiction  to  hear

 Corporations  Law  matters,  and  the  uncertainty  is  flowing  on  to  Australian

 businesses and international investors seeking to conduct business in Australia.

 Since Re  Wakim,  there  have  been  other  significant  High  Court  decisions—

 Byrnesiii  and  Bondiv—which  have  each  cast  further  doubt  on  the  viability  of

 maintaining the current Corporations Law scheme.

 In Hughesv, handed down earlier this month, further uncertainty was cast on the

 scheme.

 The  appeal  failed  to  prove  that  it  was  unconstitutional  for  the  Commonwealth

 Director of Public Prosecutions to exercise State powers in prosecuting offences

 against State Corporations Law.

 Justice Michael Kirby, however, indicated that “it remains to be seen whether, in

 other factual circumstances, such defects will prove fatal to other prosecutions”,

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 13/24

 and  that  “the  next  case  may  not  present  circumstances  sufficient  to  attract  the

 essential constitutional support.”

 Justice  Kirby’s  comments  clearly  indicate  that  the  existing  system  of

 Corporations Law in  Australia  may face  further  challenges  in  the  future,  unless

 remedial action is taken.

 The  Law  Council  acknowledges  that  the  Federal  and  State  Attorneys-General

 have been working cooperatively through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General—prior to the decision in Re Wakim—to find a pragmatic and achievable

 solution to the jurisdictional problems relating to Corporations Law in Australia.

 The  Law  Council  fully  supports  calls  by  the  Federal  Attorney-General  for  the

 States to now refer their corporations powers to the Commonwealth, in order to

 resolve the situation.

 The referral option has successful precedents—it does not require constitutional

 amendment,  and  would  resolve  the  jurisdictional  problems  which  have  now

 arisen in the Corporations Law area.  It could also be implemented quickly.

 The governments of Western Australia and South Australia appear to be the only

 State  governments  still  advocating  a  referendum  to  amend  the  Constitution  as

 the optimum solution.

 The  Law  Council  agrees  with  the  Federal  Attorney-General,  however,  that  a

 referendum is probably not attainable, given the large cost involved, the difficulty

 of explaining the issue to the Australian people, and the strong possibility that a

 referendum  to  amend  the  Constitution  in  this  regard  would  fail,  even  with

 bipartisan support.

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 14/24

 The  Law  Council  urges  the  Western  Australian  and  South  Australian

 governments  to  urgently  support  the  referral  of  powers  option,  so  that  this

 jurisdictional crisis can be remedied quickly.

 Referrals of power—or the cooperative achievement of uniform laws amongst the

 Commonwealth, State and Territory governments—are achievable resolutions to

 the problem of a lack of uniform laws in many areas.

 They  require,  however,  a  commitment  on  the  part  of  State  and  Territory

 governments  to  look  beyond  parochial  concerns,  to  the  wider  benefits  to  their

 constituency  and  to  all  Australians,  of  having  uniform  laws.   The  Law  Council

 sees  SCAG  as  the  most  appropriate  forum  in  which  to  further  develop  national

 laws, or nationally uniform laws.

 The  Law  Council  will  continue  to  support  SCAG  in  its  work,  and  to  make

 submissions to it where the Law Council considers uniformity of laws should be

 developed.

 Legal Issues with Social Impact

 Over the past five years, the Council has increasingly added its voice in a wide

 range of legal issues which have a significant social impact.

 Often,  these  issues  have  concerned  the  need  to  uphold  the  Rule  of  Law  and

 principles  of  natural  justice,  and  the  need  for  countries—including  Australia—to

 comply with their international treaty obligations.

 A good example of an international treaty obligation issue is the French nuclear

 testing debacle in the Pacific in 1995.

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 15/24

 The Law Council took the view that France’s resumption of nuclear testing would

 place  it  in  flagrant  breach  of  its  obligations  under  international  law  and  various

 international treaties.

 Along with other international legal associations, the Council called on France to

 resubmit itself to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, so that legal

 claims against France’s proposed actions could be determined.

 Then in 1998, the Law Council publicly indicated its concern at the detention of

 the former Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim, under Malaysia’s

 Internal Security Act.  It urged the Malaysian Government to ensure that Anwar’s

 trial was conducted in a fair manner, and under the highest principles relating to

 the Rule of Law and natural justice.  The Law Council, along with the Malaysian

 Bar Council, continued to monitor Anwar’s trial.

 In  May  last  year,  the  Law  Council  also  publicly  indicated  its  concern  that  the

 Belgrade court trial of the three CARE Australia aid workers, Steve Pratt, Peter

 Wallace and Branco Jelen, was highly unjust and in contravention of international

 fair trial standards.

 In  January  this  year,  the  Law  Council  expressed  its  concern  at  the  arrest  of

 prominent  Malaysian  lawyer,  Mr  Karpal  Singh,  on  charges  under  Malaysia’s

 Sedition Act.  Mr Singh was a high profile member of the defence team in the trial

 of  Anwar  Ibrahim.   The  Law  Council  called  for  the  maintenance  of  basic

 freedoms and the Rule of Law in Malaysia in relation to Mr Singh’s arrest.

 But  the  maintenance  of  fair  trial  standards,  upholding  the  independence  of  the

 judiciary,  and  ensuring  compliance  with  international  conventions  is  not  only  a

 requirement  overseas.   These  are  just  as  important  domestically,  and  the  Law

 Council sees it as essential that it should advocate Australia’s adherence to the

 standards.

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 16/24

 One  such  prominent  issue  this  year  has  been  mandatory  sentencing,  which

 relates fundamentally to the capacity of  our legal system to deliver fair and just

 outcomes for all parties.

 The  mandatory  sentencing  regimes  in  Western  Australia  and  the  Northern

 Territory represent bad  law,  and  the  Federal Government’s recently announced

 funding  for  additional  diversionary conferencing  programs  for  juvenile  offenders

 in the Northern Territory does nothing to remedy that.

 These  laws  take  away  from  our  judicial  officers  their  ability  to  hand  down

 appropriate  penalties  for  individuals,  after  taking  into  account  their  individual

 circumstances.   They  adversely  affect  both  adults  and  children  in  Western

 Australia and the Northern Territory.

 In this way, the laws arguably:

 â¢ breach the standards for fair trials;

 â¢ breach the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rightsvi, which states

 that  nobody  should  be  subjected  to  arbitrary  detention,  and  that  convicted

 persons have a right for their sentences (in addition to the cases themselves)

 to be reviewed by higher authorities;

 â¢  breach  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Childvii,  which

 stipulates  that  the  imprisonment  of  children  must  be  viewed  as  an  option  of

 last  resort,  and  that  the  best  interests  of  the  child  should  be  the  main

 consideration in sentencing; and

 â¢  breach  a  fundamental  requirement  of  the  Rule  of  Law,  that  being  the

 independence of the judiciary from the Executive Government.  This breach is

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 17/24

 occurring  because  the  Governments  of  the  Northern  Territory  and  Western

 Australia are essentially dictating to judicial officers in those jurisdictions the

 sentences they must apply for specific types of offences.

 The  optimum  solution,  in  the  Law  Council’s  view,  would  have  been  for  the

 Federal  Parliament  to  have  introduced  and  passed  legislation  to  override  and

 prevent  mandatory  sentencing  for  both  adults  and  juveniles  in  all  States  and

 Territories of Australia.

 The  Bill  put  forward  by  Senator  Bob  Brown,  the  Australian  Democrats  and  the

 Labor  Party—but  which  was  not  supported  by the  Coalition  Government—went

 part of the way towards that solution, in that it sought to override and prevent the

 mandatory sentencing of juveniles across Australia.

 Several  senior  Federal  Government  Ministers—including  the  Prime  Minister—

 and  a  number  of  Coalition  backbenchers,  while  denouncing  mandatory

 sentencing,  decided  not  to  support  legislation  which  would  override  the  laws  in

 Western  Australia  and  the  Northern  Territory.   The  Federal  Government  stated

 that it does not believe in overriding the States or Territories in areas of the law

 perceived to be the preserve of the States and Territories.

 The  Law  Council,  nevertheless,  maintains  that  mandatory  sentencing  has  no

 place  in  the  justice  systems  of  civilised  democracies  like  Australia.   It  is  unfair

 and,  in  the  Law  Council’s  view,  it  is  contrary  to  international  treaty  obligations

 which Australia has ratified.

 Whilst  I  have  mentioned  the  independence  of  the  judges  in  the  context  of

 mandatory sentencing,  I  make  the  observation  that  the  Law Council  finds  itself

 now and then defending the judiciary and the federal courts.  This has arisen at

 least twice during my Presidency, in respect of the Federal Court and the Family

 Court.

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 18/24

 Whilst  our  Chief  Justices  are  not  restrained  from  making  public  comment  on

 matters  directly  impinging  on  their  Courts’  operations,  they  are  constrained  in

 responding to unwarranted attacks.

 A good example of the former was the observation made by the Chief Justice of

 Australia,  the  Hon.  Justice  Murray  Gleeson  AC,  in  his  State  of  the  Judicature

 Address at last year’s Australian Legal Convention.viii

 In  his  Address,  the  Chief  Justice  highlighted  the  growing  problem  of

 unrepresented litigants in the High Court, and he linked this to insufficient legal

 aid funding.

 In contrast, an unfair attack was made in a newspaper editorial earlier this year,

 which  indicated  that  the  Federal  Court  had  an  employee  and  union  bias  in  the

 context of its Workplace Relations jurisdiction.

 I responded to that attack in a letter-to-the-editor, indicating that the editorial was

 “misleading  and  misinformed”,  and  was  an  “adverse  and  unfair  commentary  on

 what is widely considered a world-class court.”

 There  are  times  where  the  Law  Council  considers  that  it  must  take  action  to

 uphold the independence of the judiciary.  During my Presidency, this has been

 illustrated by the issue of the remuneration arrangements for the Chief Magistrate

 of the Northern Territory.

 The  Law  Council  called  for  the  Chief  Minister  and  Attorney-General  of  the

 Northern Territory, the Hon. Denis Burke MLA, to release publicly the complete

 details of the Chief Magistrate’s remuneration package.  In a letter which I sent to

 the  Chief  Minister  in  March,  I  indicated  the  Law  Council’s  concern  that  public

 confidence in the Chief Magistrate and the Magistracy may be undermined if the

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 19/24

 complete  remuneration  details  were  not  disclosed.   I  also  indicated  that  it  may

 cast  doubt  on  past  determinations  by  the  Chief  Magistrate,  and  may  raise

 questions as to the Chief Magistrate’s impartiality in future hearings, as he may

 be perceived, rightly or wrongly, as having a special affiliation with the Northern

 Territory’s Government.

 As  many  of  you  know,  this  issue  has  caused  considerable  controversy  both

 within  the  Northern  Territory  and  nationally.   We  are  now  left  with  the  position

 where legal challenges are being brought as to the Chief Magistrate’s capacity to

 hear cases on the grounds of perceived bias.

 In  addition,  there  has  been  a  challenge  to  the  capacity  of  one  of  the  resident

 Northern Territory Supreme Court judges to hear one such challenge.

 In  my  view,  this  is  very  unfortunate.   It  comes  close  on  the  heels  of  the  Chief

 Minister’s  statement  in  February  this  year  that  the  Northern  Territory’s  legal

 system  is  “corrupt”.   This  was  said  in  the  heat  of  the  mandatory  sentencing

 debate,  and  I  responded  to  that  statement,  through  a  press  release,  by  saying

 that such a statement was grave, and should never be made as a throwaway line

 without justification and substantiation.

 What can be drawn from this?

 There  is  no  doubt,  in  my  view,  that  the  recent  furore  in  the  Northern  Territory

 illustrates sharply that people in the public domain (and I am not only referring to

 politicians) and the print media in particular have to be extremely cautious in their

 criticism of, or commentary on, judicial officers and the courts.  This is because

 such  criticism  diminishes  the  standing  of  the  judiciary  and  public  confidence  in

 the judicial system.

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 20/24

 I am not suggesting, of course, that there should not be constructive debate on

 the effect and outcome of particular cases.  An excellent example of this recently

 has been the extensive commentary on Re Wakim.

 Apart from mandatory sentencing, there have been other legal issues of profound

 social significance which have been addressed recently by the Law Council.

 One  such  issue  has  been  the  attempts,  by  the  Federal  Government,  to  restrict

 the ability of refugees and asylum-seekers to seek the judicial review of tribunal

 decisions which deny them residence or visas to remain in Australia.

 Commonwealth  legal  aid  funding  is  now  virtually  unavailable  to  any  refugee  or

 asylum-seeker attempting to put forward their case to remain in Australia.

 This  has  been  coupled  with  draft  legislation,  introduced  by  the  Federal

 Government, to severely limit the ability of refugees and asylum-seekers to gain

 access  to  independent  legal  assistance,  or  to  have  tribunal  decisions  affecting

 them reviewed by the Courts.

 This  year,  the  Federal  Government  has  also  sought  effectively  to  ban  class-actions on matters concerning the rights of refugees and asylum-seekers.

 While  the  Law  Council  appreciates  that  the  influx  of  illegal  arrivals  has  been  a

 major  problem  for  the  Federal  Government,  refugees  and  asylum-seekers  still

 deserve a fair review of their cases through the proper judicial processes.  They

 also have a right to independent legal representation.

 There is a strong argument that, by the Federal Government attempting to limit

 the  judicial  review  of  administrative  decisions  involving  refugees  and  asylum-seekers, by denying legal aid and independent legal assistance, and by moving

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 21/24

 to disallow class actions in this area, it may be breaching a number of Australia’s

 international legal obligations.

 Most recently, the Law Council has adopted a policy on the ongoing problem of

 illicit drugs control.

 Many of  the practising lawyers  which  the  Law Council represents  observe  daily

 the  end  product  of  criminal  law-focussed  drug  control  policies.   The  legal

 profession sees the problem from all perspectives.  It sees the problem from the

 perspective of both prosecution and defence lawyers in drug use-related cases,

 and  it  also  sees  the  effects  of  drug-related  deaths,  drug-related  burglaries  and

 the effect on victims and families.

 At  its  Council  meeting  last  month,  the  Law  Council  adopted  a  four-pronged

 resolution on drugs, and called for the Federal, State and Territory governments

 to  consider  urgently  a  range  of  proposals  to  address  the  drug  problem  in

 Australia.

 The Council’s resolution calls for:

 â¢  the  immediate  re-establishment  and  commencement  of  the  cancelled

 ACT trial of medically prescribed heroin with a view to adopting harm

 minimisation  policies  similar  to  those  adopted  in  Switzerland  and  the

 Netherlands;

 â¢  the  immediate  establishment  of  a  network  of  supervised  injecting

 facilities in areas where there is a high incidence of chaotic intravenous

 drug use behaviour;

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 22/24

 â¢ the passing of legislation in all jurisdictions throughout Australia, giving

 courts the option of suspended or deferred sentences for drug addicted

 offenders who have a real prospect of rehabilitation; and

 â¢  the  immediate  decriminalisation  of  possession  and  cultivation  of

 cannabis  for  personal  use  with  the  short  term  goal  of  separating

 cannabis users from those who would sell them heroin, the long term

 goal being the adoption of policies similar to those so successfully put

 in place in the Netherlands.

 This  resolution  follows  the  Council’s  1995  resolution  supporting  the  then

 proposed ACT Heroin Trial.

 While the Law Council does not support illicit drug use, it believes that the

 Federal, State and Territory governments have a responsibility to trial other

 methods of illegal drug control, given that current prohibition policies are not

 working.

 Drug addiction should be treated more as a medical and health issue, rather than

 solely as a criminal law issue.  The current approaches to drug prohibition have

 been a tragic and expensive failure, and other avenues must now be trialled and

 tried.

 I  acknowledge  that  some  advances  have  been  made  recently  in  several

 jurisdictions,  with  proposals  for,  or  the  establishment  of,  a  small  number  of

 supervised injecting facilities, drug courts, and the decriminalisation of cannabis

 for personal use.

 But  the  Federal Government  should  urgently take  the lead  and  permit  a  trial of

 medically prescribed heroin to proceed in the Australian Capital Territory.  Such a

 trial is supported by the ACT Legislative Assembly.

 Dr Gordon Hughes, National Press Club Telstra Address, page 23/24

 Given  the  well-documented  success  of  programs  in  the  Netherlands  and

 Switzerland—in curbing heroin overdoses and deaths, and drug-related crime—

 the  Law  Council  believes  that  the  Federal  Government  has  a  responsibility  to

 ensure that the trial proceeds.

 Recently, it was announced by the Federal Parliament that a national inquiry into

 substance abuse would be held.  The House of Representatives Family and

 Community Affairs Committee’s Substance Abuse in Australian Communities

 Inquiry will investigate the social and economic costs of both legal and illegal

 drugs in Australian society.

 The Law Council welcomes the establishment of the Inquiry, which was referred

 to the Committee by the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon. Dr Michael

 Wooldridge MP.

 We  are  hopeful  that  this  Inquiry  will  closely  consider  alternative  strategies  for

 drug control.

 Conclusion

 As you will have gathered today, the Law Council finds itself in a very significant

 period of reform, both of the Australian legal profession and justice system, and

 of laws and issues directly affecting the Australian community.

 I have no doubt that, as we move further into the 21st Century, the Law Council

 will continue to develop its role of leadership in both these fields of reform, for the

 benefit  of  legal  consumers,  the  legal  profession,  our  justice  system,  and  the

 wider community.
