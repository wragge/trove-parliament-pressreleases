 The Greens have recognised World Refugee Day today, saying it should mark the start of better immigration 

 policy and protection of human rights in Australia, including the abolition of detention debts. 

 

 “Today on World Refugee Day we recognise struggle but celebrate survival, courage and humanity,” said Senator 

 Sarah Hanson-Young, Greens spokesperson for Human Rights. 

 “Whenever I listen to the stories of those who have sought refuge in Australia, from places as far away as Sudan, 

 Vietnam or Afghanistan, I am constantly inspired by the courage these people demonstrate to seek protection for 

 their families. 

 “Today we should celebrate the rich diversity of our community brought about by groups of refugees over the 

 years." 

 Senator Hanson-Young acknowledged the rise in displaced people around the world. 

 “Australia too has noticed the rise in people seeking refuge from around the world in recent months,” she said. 

 “Like all safe, secure, and lucky nations, we have a responsibility to offer protection to those seeking assistance. 

 “While we’ve seen a shift to a more humane approach to treating the world’s most vulnerable people, who are 

 prepared to seek refuge by risking a dangerous passage to our shores, Australia still has a long way to go. 

 “For example, we still punish people for seeking refuge via boat, even when they have no other choice but to do 

 so.” 

 Senator Hanson-Young said the Greens were looking forward to debating the Government’s legislation next week 

 to abolish debts for immigration detainees who are granted refugee status. 

 “I look forward to voting to remove this harmful policy, that simply adds insult to injury for people who have done 

 nothing wrong; done nothing but seek freedom and safety for their families,” she said. 

 “The Greens urge the Senate to make this year’s World Refugee Day the signpost to a more humane way forward 

 for Australia’s immigration policy.”
