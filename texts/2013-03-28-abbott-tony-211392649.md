 TONY ABBOTT:    

 It's terrific to be here in the electorate of Griffith this morning with Bill Glasson, our candidate, and with Joe  Hockey, the Shadow Treasurer. It’s great to be out and about in electorates right around Australia talking to  the Australian people. The Australian people know we are a great country. They know we are let down right  now by a bad government and they are waiting for a change in Canberra. They want positive plans. They  want real solutions. They want a better way and that's what the Coalition offers. We get rid of the carbon tax  and the mining tax, we cut red tape, we stop the boats, we give our country modern infrastructure with  things like the Gateway Motorway upgrade and we get the budget back into the black because if we can stop  the wasteful spending, there is more money to spend on the things Australians really need. So, people like  Joe and myself and here in Griffith, Bill Glasson, we are offering hope to the Australian people and that is  what people so want after five wasted years; after five years when our country has stood still or even in  some ways gone backwards.     

 Now, speaking of going backwards, yesterday we had the 600th boat under the current government. That's  35,000 illegal arrivals by boat. This government has no answers. Its only response is to make excuses for  itself and to blame others. Well, it’s just not good enough. It really isn't good enough. We know what needs  to be done. What needs to be done is that we have got to put back in place the policies that worked before.  Julia Gillard used to put out press releases when she was in Opposition saying "Another boat, another policy  failure". Well, there were hardly any policy failures under the Howard Government because there were  hardly any boats. We’ve had 600 policy failures under the current government. It’s just not good enough.  Effectively, this Government has surrendered to the people smugglers.     

 Finally, before I ask Joe and Bill to say a few words, look, Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson are right. The  Prime Minister should end the class war and the latest escalation on the class war is the Prime Minister and  the Treasurer's coming attack on your superannuation. I want to say to the Australian people - your  superannuation is safe under the Coalition. Your superannuation should be sacrosanct. There is no way that  your superannuation should be raided by a bad government to get itself out of a hole. The Government  should not be damaging your future to secure its future. The Government should not be raiding your money  to get money for itself. It is a sign of just how debauched this Government has got that when it is in a hole, a 

 hole of its own making, it should be seeking to trash your superannuation - trash, in fact, Labor's historic  legacy - to try to fix up a problem which it has caused. So, really, it’s high time for Julia Gillard and Wayne  Swan to listen to the elder statements of the Labor Party, Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson on this. The  Labor Party is deeply divided on superannuation and really it should listen to the people who know what  they’re talking about and in this case that's Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson.     

 I’m going to ask Joe to say a few words, then Bill, and then we’ll take some questions.    

 JOE HOCKEY:     

 Thanks, Tony. Great to be here with Bill Glasson. Look, I totally agree with what Tony has been saying and  we’ve been saying consistently now and that is Labor has a savings problem. They spend more than they  save in government. Now they want to make their savings problem your savings problem. They are going  after your savings in superannuation. Labor traditionally likes to lay claim to ownership of the concept of  superannuation. Now, Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan want to take a baseball bat to people’s superannuation  rather than take a baseball bat to their own waste. They want you to pay for their problems and it is all of  their own making. They blame everyone except themselves. The fundamental point is, Labor doesn't know  how to manage money, Labor doesn’t know how to live within its means and they are now going to hit  Australian’s superannuation accounts to pay for their problems. So, this is just another example of a  government that’s run out of ideas, run out of money and now asking the Australian people to pay for it.    

 BILL GLASSON:    

 Thanks Tony and thanks Joe. Just to say that it is a great privilege to be standing as the federal candidate for  the seat of Griffith. It is an opportunity, I suppose, to give back to a community which I have grown up in  and brought my family up in. Can I say that after the circus last week in Canberra, the clear message from  the electorate as I've walked from door to door is they are fed up to the back teeth with this bad government,  they are fed up to the back teeth with a government that's just purely focused on leadership rather than  focused on the problems of the people of Griffith; and they are the cost of living - talk to businesses around  here - the cost of the carbon tax, of putting power up and they have driven them out of business. So the cost  of living is a huge issue. The border protection issue is another one people raise continuously. It is the  sovereign responsibility of any government to make sure we protect our borders and really the other issue is  the debt. We have this spiralling debt and they are asking me who is going to pay for it, is it going to be me  or my children? Well the reality is, it’s probably going to be all of us.     

 Can I say it is a great privilege and thank you to Tony and Joe for coming to the seat of Griffith and we look  forward to a change in the member for Griffith hopefully at the upcoming election.    

 JOE HOCKEY:    

 Hear, hear.     

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Thanks mate, well said. Ok, do we have any questions?    

 QUESTION:    

 The Financial Review published polls in this morning's paper indicating a landslide 11 per cent swing  against Labor in Queensland. What's the dangers of the Opposition becoming too cocky?     

 TONY ABBOTT    

 Well, I don't think anyone looking at the way our candidates are working, candidates such as Bill Glasson,  would ever think we are taking anything for granted. All of our candidates are working very hard, they're at 

 bus stops, railway stations, shopping centres, school gates. They are out there working hard to demonstrate  to the Australian people that we have a plan. We have a Real Solutions plan for their future. All the  government has is excuses and attacks on everyone for its own mistakes.    

 QUESTION:    

 And if Labor makes changes to contributions to superannuation, can you guarantee that the Coalition will  repeal it?     

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I can guarantee that we are not going to launch sneak attacks on people's savings. We are not going to  launch a smash and grab raid on the savings of the Australian people. We think that the superannuation  savings of Australians, it is your money, it belongs to you. It doesn't belong to the Government and the  Government should keep its greedy hands off it.     

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, you say you won't make any adverse changes to superannuation. Would you consider making  changes that a lot of the over 50 cohort are calling out for, such as allowing tax concessions on funds that are  over $500,000 for example?     

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, look at our record in government. Our record in government was that we wanted to encourage  superannuation. So, we certainly don't rule out beneficial changes for superannuation but at the moment  there is a terrible budget hole that has been created by this government. We’ve gone from $20 billion  surpluses to $50 billion deficits. We’ve gone from the four biggest surpluses in our history under Peter  Costello to the four biggest deficits in our history under Wayne Swan. So, we’re not making positive  promises but we are saying there’ll be no unexpected adverse changes to your superannuation under a  Coalition government.     

 QUESTION:     

 Mr Abbott, the Queensland Government has recently announced that it’s not going to fund the Cape York  welfare reform trial after 2013. What do you think of your friend Noel Pearson’s call for the Federal  Government to takeover indigenous affairs?     

 TONY ABBOTT:     

 As you know, I am a big supporter of the welfare reform process. I think that the welfare reform process has  done a great deal for the people of Cape York, particularly for the four welfare reform communities. I thank  and congratulate Noel for the leadership he has provided to our whole nation on this. I acknowledge the  Federal Government's contribution starting under the Howard Government and continuing under the current  government. I thank the Queensland Government, the former government, the present government, for its  contribution. I want to see welfare reform spread beyond the four Cape communities where it is currently  focused. I want to see it spread throughout Queensland and hopefully throughout Australia. So, I’m happy to  work constructively with all levels of government and with Noel to try to make sure this happens.    

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, are you disappointed ACT Liberal Senator Gary Humphries' dumping was confirmed last night?     

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 The short answer is yes I am, but in the end I respect the right of the lay party to make these decisions. Zed  has been a very good Leader of the Opposition. Gary was a fine Chief Minister. But Zed has been a good  Leader of the Opposition and I think that gives him the necessary experience and the qualities to be a fine  Senator for the ACT in the years ahead.    

 QUESTION:    

 Back to this morning's polls, do you think it is realistic that your government could win most of the seats  here in Queensland, even Mr Rudd's seat?     

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 We want to be competitive everywhere. We don't surrender any seat to the Labor Party because we think the  Australian people everywhere want change. They want change for the better. The only way they are going to  get change for the better is if they change the government. The only way to change the government,  regardless of the seat, is to vote for the Coalition candidate and in Queensland, the LNP candidates. You  can't change the government by voting for your sitting Labor member, whether he or she is a good bloke or  not. You can't change the government by voting for an Independent. You can't change the government by  voting Green. You can't change the government by voting for a minor party. The only way you can change  the government is by voting for the LNP. That's why we are fighting very hard for the Australian people in  every electorate.     

 QUESTION:    

 On border security, Mr Abbott, are you confident that Indonesia would accept boats a Coalition government  has turned back?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I am confident we can have a much more constructive and candid and collegial relationship with Indonesia  than the current government has managed. The current government has trashed the relationship with  Indonesia through megaphone diplomacy, through the appalling disaster of the cancellation of the live cattle  export trade in panic at a television program. We would never do anything like that. We have spoken to the  Indonesian Government now on many occasions. I have met with President Yudhoyono on three occasions.  Julie Bishop has had many meetings with Foreign Minister Natalegawa and other senior officials of the  Indonesian Government. Scott Morrison has had many meetings with senior officials of the Indonesian  Government. We are confident that they know where we are. We know where they are. We are confident  that we can work together very constructively in the future the way we've worked very constructively  together under the Howard Government.    

 QUESTION:    

 Can I just ask Joe Hockey, can you also guarantee that you won't reverse the superannuation guarantee that  the Government has given from 9 to 12 per cent?     

 JOE HOCKEY:    

 Yes, we have already stated that we are going to continue with that programme to increase it to 12 per cent.  That is the only initiative out of the mining tax that we have committed to. So, nothing has changed.    

 QUESTION:    

 Is it unusual for something to become policy without going to Shadow Cabinet?     

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 

 Well, that's a hypothetical question. I don't answer hypotheticals.    

 QUESTION:    

 Scott Morrison says behavioural protocol is policy now. Are you comfortable with that?    

 JOE HOCKEY:    

 He is the Shadow Minister responsible for this area. It is our position to go ahead with that. He is perfectly  entitled to raise the issue and discuss it and from our perspective, our number one priority is to stop the  boats. We have to stop the boats to bring integrity back to our immigration programme and give Australians  confidence that the government is actually in charge of our borders.    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 All happy?    

 Good, thank you.
