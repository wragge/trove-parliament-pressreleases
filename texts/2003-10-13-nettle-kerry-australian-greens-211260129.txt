 Vanstone fails first test on Immigration   

 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today exposed the slack approach of the new  Immigration Minister, Amanda Vanstone, who failed to answer her first question  since taking on the portfolio.    

 Senator Nettle asked why Australia continues to dump non-Syrian asylum  seekers in Syria, and fails to monitor the fate of anyone they deport.   

 "Senator Vanstone has been Immigration Minister for a week but still appears to  know nothing about it. What has she been doing for the past seven days?"  Senator Nettle said. 

 

 "Syria clearly plays a pivotal role in the government's immigration strategy, but  Senator Vanstone could not clarify whether Australia has any agreement with  Syria regarding deportations. 

 

 "I will await with interest the answers that Senator Vanstone took on notice. The  government has to explain why it regularly deports non-Syrian asylum seekers to  a country with an appalling human rights record, which has not signed the  Refugee Convention.   

 "Senator Vanstone needs to make the monitoring of asylum seekers that  Australia has deported a priority. Without this monitoring the government remains  oblivious to the fate of these individuals and so cannot manage its responsibilities  under international law to prevent their return to face persecution.   

 "The report issued by the Edmund Rice Centre last week detailed numerous  examples of deportees suffering persecution, and oppression when dumped in  Syria. The immigration department appears indifferent to this human tragedy. 

 

 The Greens will continue to question the new Immigration Minister in the pursuit  of urgent reform of our national immigration policies which continue to abuse the  human rights of those seeking a better life in Australia.
