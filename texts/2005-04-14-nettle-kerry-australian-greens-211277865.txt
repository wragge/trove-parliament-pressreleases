 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 Vanstone immigration priorities all wrong 

 14th Apr 05 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle has criticised the Immigration Minister Amanda  Vanstone, who today announced a plan to boost immigration by seeking 20,000  skilled migrants, as 'getting her immigration priorities wrong."  "If there is to be an increase in immigration then the first priority must be  humanitarian and compassionate," Senator Nettle said.  "The Minister should give permanent status to the thousands of genuine refugees  currently languishing on Temporary Protection Visas (TPVs). TPV holders are often  highly skilled but are prevented from using their skills by their visa restrictions.  They should also be allowed family re-union rights.  "The immigration system is not the best tool to address skill shortages. Its  effectiveness in providing sustainable long term solutions to labour market  problems is questionable at best.  "The government's first priority should be to end the horror of mandatory  detention. To grant residency to the few hundred people still in detention and on  Nauru would be a drop in the ocean of the 20,000 extra migrants the Minister is  proposing.   "Skilled people like Amir Mesrenijad, a fisheries management expert, would love to  contribute to Australia but instead languish behind the razor wire in immigration  detention.  "Twenty thousand extra migrants represent an increase of about 15% to our  immigration programme at a time when this government continues to lock up  hundreds of asylum seekers.  The Minister for Immigration also announced that she would be abolishing  provisions that allowed adults who have grown up in Australia in families without  valid visas to apply for permanent residency.  "The Minister's decision today to make it harder for children of families without  valid visas to gain permanent residency is yet another example of this government  willingness to punish the innocent for the actions of others."
