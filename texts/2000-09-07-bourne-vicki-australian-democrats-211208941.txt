 Senator Vicki Bourne Party Whip and Senator for New South Wales

 Press Release Dated: 7 Sep 2000 Press Release Number: 00/576 Portfolio: Human Rights (Domestic) Related: Human Rights (International)

 Democrats demand a "fair go" for all Australians The Australian Democrats’ spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, Senator Vicki Bourne, said today that the Prime Minister has glossed over the real implications of his Government's "strategic engagement" in his statement to the United Nations.

 "The Prime Minister said that the "ideals a nation holds for itself are often found more in the everyday speech of its people than in the rhetoric of politics and diplomacy.”

 "How true this is, and how true it is for the people in our country who do experience human rights violations. Not everybody in this country gets a "fair go," Senator Bourne said.

 "Indigenous people, whose every day existence is coloured by our failure to protect them from racial vilification, mandatory sentencing, poverty and ill health, are not getting a fair go.

 "People who have been incarcerated in refugee centres for years are not getting a fair go and people who have been vilified on the grounds of gender, sexuality, race, colour and age are not getting a fair go.

 "Nobody is disputing that the United Nations needs reform, even Kofi Annan acknowledges this. But let's play a constructive role and reform from within," Senator Bourne said.

 "Withdrawing from the committees, refusing to sign the First Optional Protocol of CEDAW and attacking Non Government Organisations is petulant and damaging to Australia's credibility.

 "Rather than working constructively to effect change the Government has spat the dummy.

 "I urge the Prime Minister to open his mind in New York and work with the

 International Community to strengthen and validate the United Nations system by bringing about real and constructive reform," Senator Bourne concluded.
