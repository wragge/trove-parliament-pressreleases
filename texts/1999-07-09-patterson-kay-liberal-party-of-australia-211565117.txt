  ASYLUM SEEKERS ADVICE SCHEME EXTENDED FOR ANOTHER 
TWO YEARS

  

  Senator Kay Patterson, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  
for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, today announced that the 
scheme to assist asylum applicants in Australia will continue for a 
further two years from 1 July 1999.

  

 “The Immigration Advice Application Assistance Scheme 
(IAAAS) provides application assistance by registered migration agents 
to all asylum seekers in immigration detention and to asylum seekers 
and other visa applicants in the community who can demonstrate that 
they are in financial need and that their cases have merit,” Senator 
Patterson said.

  

 “The extension of this scheme has resulted in greater 
choice of service providers for disadvantaged visa applicants.

  

 “A total of 17 contracted service providers have 
been selected, through open tender, to provide IAAAS services across 
Australia. These providers are from private legal firms and community 
based non-profit organisations.

  

 “The new IAAAS contracts commenced operation on 
1 July 1999 and will run for a period of two years,” said Senator 
Patterson.

  

 “The maintenance of the funding for IAAAS this financial 
year reflects the Government’s continued commitment to providing immigration 
advice and assistance for disadvantaged visa applicants at the primary 
and merits review stage.”
