 Work For The Dole Boosts Job Opportunities In SA

 New Work for the Dole projects in SA will offer 282 unemployed people the chance to develop worthwhile work skills and give their job hunting opportunities a real boost. The Minister for Employment Services, Mal Brough, announced 26 new projects for SA today.

 "Work for the Dole is a national success story and it continues to grow. Getting people into the workforce, or back into the workforce, benefits the whole community," Mr Brough said.

 Among the new projects are:

 In the Flinders Ranges, based at Hawker, activities include revegetation, fencing, plant and animal control, trail repair and constructing a 4WD camp site. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Helping the St Vincent de Paul Society’s Family Centre in Whyalla to collect, sort and distribute goods to needy people. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Sprucing up main entrances to Port Pirie on Warnertown Road and Port Germein Road. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Giving the Seacliff Youth Centre a face-lift, including painting and varnishing, landscaping and planting native shrubs. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 "Work for the Dole benefits not only unemployed people. Local communities benefit though enhanced services and facilities provided by the project sponsors," Mr Brough said.

 This month’s new projects bring the total number in SA since Work for the Dole began in late-1997 to 614. A total of 15,320 places have been open for SA job seekers to take part and improve their chances of finding paid work.

 Mr Brough announced a total of 539 new projects nationwide today with 7554 places. This brings the overall number of Work for the Dole projects since 1997 to 10,433, with places for 197,207 job seekers.
