 ATTORNEY-GENERAL   THE HON PHILIP RUDDOCK MP 

 

 TRANSCRIPT   

 27 October 2003  

 

 PRESS CONFERENCE ANNOUNCING A REVIEW OF MIGRATION  LITIGATION & ANSWERING QUESTIONS ON DEPORTATION OF  FRENCH NATIONAL 

 

 PHILIP RUDDOCK: The substantive issue I wanted to talk to you about this morning is the  migration  litigation  review  that  has  been  initiated,  and  today  that  review  will  commence  its   operation.   The  purpose  of  it  is  to  get  a  better  and  more  efficient  management  of  the   immigration  caseload.   The  fact  is  that  at  the  moment  the  immigration  case  load  is  so   significant in relation to the workloads of the High Court of Australia and the Federal Court  of Australia and the Federal Magistrates, that the greater part of the workload of all the courts  is now immigration-related issues.   

 I  think  one  of  the  less  understood  nature  of  the  caseload  is  that  it  occurs  in  large  part  not   because  people  are  seeking  a  just  outcome  from  a  court,  but  they  can  in  fact  obtain  a   migration outcome of remaining in Australia.  The longer the matters that they are involved in  are listed before a court, they can obtain a bridging visa.  I don't think there is any other area  of Commonwealth litigation where a litigant derives an advantage simply because they have  filed an application in the court.    

 I  think  one  area  where  it's  sometimes  argued  is  in  relation  to  tax  liabilities  that  you  might   delay the time in which you have to pay your tax debt.  And you can have it as a matter listed  before a court and under review, but it's the only area.  Generally speaking, people do not get  an advantage by getting involved in litigation.   

 The  litigation  caseload  I  think  …  the  Minister  for  Immigration  and  Multicultural  Affairs  at   the moment is in the order of 4200 active cases.  And during the course of the last year we  were looking at something like 5000 cases being dealt with by the courts during the course of  the year.  And that of course is having a very significant impact upon Australians who have  an  expectation  that  they  will  be  able  to  access  Australian  courts,  and  their  opportunity,  if   we're not able to get this matter under better management and control, is severely limited.   

 Now, there are some factual pieces of information that I wanted to put before you.  if you look  at  the  Federal  Magistrates  Court,  for  instance,  the  applications  have  either  been  filed  or   transferred to - it went from 182 in the year 2001/02, to 1397 in 2002/03.   

 In the Federal Court, migration matters comprise 66.5% of the appeals last year, up from 56%  the  previous  year.   If  you  actually  look  at  the  more  detailed  information,  the  Federal  Court   received in its original jurisdiction in the year 2002/03, 1836 matters compared with 1381 in  2001/02.  And if you look at the way in which these matters are resolved, what you find of  course is that the majority of people who have matters before the courts are unsuccessful. 

 Parliament House, Canberra  ACT  2600 â¢ Telephone (02) 6277 7300 â¢ Fax (02) 6273 4102  www.law.gov.au/ag 

 

 To  put  it  into  perspective,  in  the  Federal  Court  last  year  -  2002/03  -  the  Department  of   Immigration  experienced  a  3.37%  loss  before  the  Federal  Court  of  Australia;  before  the   Magistrates Court, 2.9%.  And if you look at the totals of Federal Court and the Magistrates  Court, the losses by the Department of Immigration were 48%.  The numbers of wins by the  Department  were  880,  and  applicant  withdrawals  were  of  the  order  of  525.   It  puts  it  very   clearly into perspective.   

 If  you  look  at  the  cost  to  the  Australian  taxpayer,  besides  running  at  the  tribunals  and  the   court system, the Immigration Department is spending something of the order I think of $25  million in litigation, up from something of the order of $6.4 million in the year 1995/96.   

 Now,  if  I  can  just  share  with  you  for  a  moment  the  future  expectations.   It  is  the  case  that   there has been a 50% fall-off in the number of people lodging asylum claims, but the advice  to me is that while inevitably in the longer term those reduced numbers will be reflected in the  litigation caseload, it is not likely to happen quickly.  And of course, if you saw an increase in  the  numbers  of  people  making  asylum  claims  in  the  future,  resort  to  litigation  would   obviously be a significant approach that they would be seeking to take.   

 Now, what is happening here is that we are not seeking to limit people's right and entitlement  to  a  just  outcome  in  relation  to  their  matters  involving  either  the  Department  for  review   tribunals  or  even  accessing  courts.   What  we  are  seeking  is  to  reduce  the  high  volume  of   unmeritorious  proceedings  before  the  courts.   And  what  we  have  sought  to  do  is  to  put   together in a taskforce all of the people who are involved in the process at various points in  time.    

 So what we have - Ms Hilary Penfold, who is the First Parliamentary Counsel, who will chair  the  review.   There  will  be  a  judge  of  the  Federal  Court  of  Australia  participating  in  the   review.   There  will  be  a  magistrate  from  the  Magistrates  Court  participating.   In  addition,   there  will  be  representatives  of  the  Department  of  Immigration,  the  Attorney-General's   Department,  as  well  as  the  Prime  Minister's  Department  participating.  The  review  will  be   serviced by the Attorney-General's Department in cooperation with the tribunals who will be  providing staffing to the review.   

 The  process  is  one  in  which  all  of  the  active  players,  including  the  Refugee  and  Migration   Review  Tribunal  will  be  involved  in  looking  at  what  administrative  changes  we  can  make,   whether there are further legislative changes that we will require to see if we can get effective  reduction  in  the  non-meritorious  caseload  before  the  courts.   This  is  a  very  important   initiative, and one in which I believe there will be a very high level of cooperation between  the  judicial  branch  and  the  executive  to  see  if  we  can  work  through  an  issue  which  has   become a major problem for us.   

 I'll take questions on the review first, then if there are other issues you want to discuss we will  do them last.   

 QUESTION: (Inaudible)   

 PHILIP RUDDOCK: I have spoken to people before the judges who recognise that this is a  difficulty with the court.  They have to operate lawfully, but they are conscious that this is an  issue  in  which  there  needs  to  be  a  level  of  cooperation.   I  welcome  the  offer  of  the  Chief   Judge to have a senior judge of the Federal Court participating in the review, as I do with the  representative  of  the  Magistrate's.   This  is  a  desire  on  the  part  of  those  who  have  separate  

 

 2 

 responsibilities,  those  who  exercise  the  judicial  function  want  to  see  these  issues  worked   through in a way which will provide more effective access to justice for all Australians.   

 QUESTION: (Inaudible)   

 PHILIP RUDDOCK: Let me just say that I am critical of anybody who is in breach of the  code  of  behaviour  or  is  -  or  are  bringing  claims  before  a  court  which  they  know  have  no   merit.  I think members of the legal profession do have an obligation to the court.  It's one of  the ethical obligations that they accept as an officer of the court.  And the fact is that we do  have  now  examples  where  the  courts  have  referred  the  conduct,  in  particular  legal   practitioners, to their professional societies for review.  And that is as it should be.  The courts  have  a  responsibility  to  ensure  that  there  is  not  an  abuse  of  the  process,  and  I  think  they   recognise that.   

 The important point here is that the courts play a very important role in providing justice to all  Australians.  If they can't provide access in a timely way because their procedures are being  abused by people lodging non-meritorious claims, that is a matter of concern to the courts as  it is to the executive arm of government.    

 QUESTION: (Inaudible)   

 PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  The  difficulty  you  have  -  and  I  offer  this  as  a  view  rather  than  a   conclusion  -  that  if  you  have  a  process  where  somebody  has  to  seek  leave,  then  everybody   who wants to delay an immigration outcome who may want to get a bridging visa will pursue  that  as  a  first  step.   And  of  course,  simply  because  you've  been  refused  leave  doesn't  mean   that you don't get the opportunity to move onto a further review of the leave decision itself.      

 And so, the concern has always been that a leave procedure can in fact add to the individual  points of which a decision can in fact be litigated, in fact make for further delay.  So that's the  difficulty.   

 But look, I would hope that the review would look at that idea along with other aspects and  offer advice to the courts in relation to their rules where that might improve procedures that  will  offer  advice  to  government  that  can  be  acted  upon  by  the  executive,  and  if  it  needs   legislative  approaches,  offer  advice  that  the  parliament  might  be  able  to  take  on  board  to   improve the handling of these matters.   

 QUESTION: (Inaudible)…administrative decision as to what is meritorious or not….   

 PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  The  question  of  how  many  times  you  give  people  opportunities  for   review  is  one  in  which  you  have  to  ask  yourself  the  question:  if  a  person  has  had  the   opportunity  to  have  their  cases  tested  by  a  departmental  decision,  reviewed  by  an   independent,  merits  review  process.   And  then  you  have  after  that,  as  we  do  now,  an   opportunity  for  four  possible  levels  of  appeal  -  the  Magistrates  Court  and  a  Federal  Court   decision, an Appellate Division of the Federal Court, and in addition, the opportunity to go to  the High Court - you have to ask yourself whether that's all that is required to deliver a just  outcome.    

 If  you  look  at  the  approach  that  was  taken  by  the  body  that  offers  advice  to  governments   around the world as to how refugee decisions should be dealt with - they don't offer advice in  relation to migration decisions, but they do in relation to refugees.  The UNHCR, the United  Nations  High  Commission  for  Refugees,  says  that  you  should  provide  a  proper  decision  

 

 3 

 making  process  for  people's  claims  to  be  determined  as  to  whether  or  not  they  have  a   protection (inaudible).   And  you  should  provide  a  merits  review  that  can  either  be   administrative or judicial.  But they are put in the alternative.  They are not put in terms that  governments should provide access to both.  There are few countries that provide the range of  review opportunities that Australia has in place with administrative review as well as judicial.    

 So  is  there  a  reason  why  expensive  procedures  should  be  borne  by  developed  countries  in   determining the minutiae of refugee claims when in most countries the decisions are made by  the  United  Nations  High  Commission  for  Refugees  in  a  two-stage  process,  that  is,  a   determination  by  an  officer  of  the  United  Nations  High  Commission  for  Refugees,  a   protection  officer,  and  an  appeal  to  another  protection  officer,  a  two-stage  process  with  no   judicial  appeal.  UNHCR  could  not  function  effectively  if  it  had  to  go  through  the  sorts  of   procedures with access to judicial review of Australian clients.     

 So  I  mean,  this  is  an  issue  about  ensuring  that  the  system  itself  is  not  abused,  it  is  not  an   approach that is designed to deny to the people who are refugees or to those who are seeking  immigration outcomes a reasonable opportunity to have any claims that they have thoroughly  investigated.   

 All right.  Over the weekend I commended a number of organisations that had been involved  in the recent visits of the President of the United States and the President of China, and I think  it is important to recognise that there was a very high level of cooperation involving security,  policing  organisations  here  in  Australia,  the  lead  agency  in  the  Australian  Capital  Territory   was  of  course  Australian  Federal  Police  where  they  were  working  very  cooperatively  with   other organisations to ensure the safety of our distinguished visitors.     

 And  with  the  Protective  Security  Coordination  Centre  in  Canberra,  levels  of  threat  were   thoroughly  assessed,  a  very  high  level  of  professional  security  arrangements  were   implemented, and I wanted to take the opportunity to thank all of those involved for what I  think were exceptional arrangements.   

 We are in a very difficult environment.  While we had no specific knowledge of any threat to  either of our distinguished visitors, it is obvious that long before September 11 Australia has  been vulnerable to terrorist threats.  That's the reason that we've seen a very comprehensive  review  of  Commonwealth  legislation  and  continuing  review  of  the  legislative  and   administrative arrangements for security arrangements domestically in Australia.   

 We  have  substantially  increased  resources  to  all  of  our  organisations,  and  as  you  know,  I   think,  a  little  over  a  week  ago  that  I  announced  the  establishment  of  a  national  threat   assessment centre for ensuring that security authorities, police and the government generally  were better able to respond to any urgent threats that might exist.   

 These are not issues about which if it is possible for the government to seek to speak about to  any (inaudible) hampers your efforts to contain information if there is a lot of media coverage  directed to those areas of which you might be seeking to make an inquiry.     

 Yesterday, France - there were published some details in relation to matters which authorities  here in Australia had been engaged in for some time.  And I think it's now well known that a  French national who came to Australia as a tourist remained in Australia, was the subject of  information from the French intelligence to authorities in Australia that he had been training  in  relation  to  terrorist  activities  abroad,  and  that  he  was  in  Australia.   Inquiries  led  to   information being obtained, and he was in breach of visa conditions in relation to his entry to 

 

 4 

 Australia.  And he was therefore, I think, detained in early October by immigration officials,  and subsequently left Australia to France where he has been questioned in France.   

 Yesterday,  last  night  (inaudible)  on  the  basis  of  warrants  issued  to  ASIO,  search  premises,   motor vehicles and to look at personal effects and equipment.  There were a number of people  who were seen by ASIO, the Australian Federal Police and the New South Wales Police as  those warrants were executed.     

 The  way  in  which  it  was  undertaken  has  not,  I  understand,  led  to  any  complaints,  but   importantly  those  authorities  needed  to  obtain  information  through  the  exercising  of  those   warrants (inaudible)  better  equipped  to  continue  the  investigations  that  they  are  at  present   pursuing.   

 I don't think there is very much more that I can add to that, but let me just assure you those  who view or hear these reports, we take these matters very seriously.  There has been a very  high  level  of  cooperation  involving  foreign  agencies  with  the  Australian  Intelligence   Organisation as well as Commonwealth and state police organisations.  And I can assure you  that we remain vigilant in relation to these matters.   

 QUESTION: (Inaudible)   

 PHILIP RUDDOCK: Well, I mean, that is always possible.  It's one of the reasons that you  have  intelligence  organisations  to  seek  to  ascertain  as  much  as  we  can  about  people  whose   intentions may be to cause some harm to the Australian community.  We work with overseas  agencies  to  establish  databases  of  people  who  are  of  potential  concern  accessing  Australia.    But the important point that I make to officials from time to time is that those alert systems  that we use are only as good as the information that is put on them.  And that means there has  to be a high level of cooperation with the other agencies that may have information.   

 You can ask why you may not have got it, and I have asked that those questions be put.  I  don't know that France is necessarily aware before 22nd September, which was the date that  they informed us that he might be present in Australia, of him.  They may not have been.  It  may have been that they only became recently aware of his activities themselves.    

 But we are, I think, better placed than most countries because we have a universal visa system  that we have to apply in relation to something like four million visitors a year.  The degree of  risk management identifying those people that potentially fit profiles that might be of concern  and to invite inquiries by appropriate agencies, we'll have profiles met.   

 But the other aspect is that we do maintain alert lists.  They have upwards of 100,000 or more  names in relation to people who are of concern to security and police authorities.  They have  many other people who have been the subject of either a lost document or have been known  to immigration officials for immigration-type offences.  We have, I think, in world terms, a  very comprehensive alert system, but it is always limited by the extent to which you are able  to obtain timely and accurate information.   

 QUESTION:  …Australian authorities?   

 PHILIP RUDDOCK: We'll start in this direction and I'll start with you.   

 QUESTION: (Inaudible)   

 

 5 

 PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  The  immigration  issues  were  matters  which  Immigration  had  to  be   aware of the need for a person to be taken to immigration detention, and that took place fairly  quickly.  But  the  point  I  would  make  is  that  agencies  have  been  involved  in  relation  to  this   matter for some time.  The reason that we are aware now that agencies have been involved in  making inquiries here is because the information was becoming publicly known elsewhere.     

 And inquiries by intelligence organisations are not inquiries that can be readily undertaken as  a public inquiry.  It's intrinsically people who are seeking to hide their movements, who are  involved in clandestine but high risk activities, don't do it in the glare of publicity.  It's one of  the issues you face.    

 QUESTION: (Inaudible)   

 PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  These  are  operational  issues  about  which  it  would  be  quite   inappropriate for me to comment but I wouldn't put these dates out if I wasn't aware and the  agencies  that  report  to  me  were  not  aware  of  his  presence  and  taking  all  appropriate  steps   within  their  powers  and  capacities  to  deal  with  him  but  let  me  just  say,  the  nature  of  our   society is one in which our agencies do not have the power and it's quite clear the French do.   You  know  that  we've  only  recently  given  intelligence  authorities  here  in  Australia  the   opportunity  to  detain  and  question  people  and  the  Parliament  has  determined  that  those   powers have to be implemented in ways which are providing a very high level of supervision  to the security agency when it undertakes to use those powers which includes the obtaining of  a warrant from a judicial officer for it first to be able to be used.  That means you have to have  information sufficient to satisfy the officer that it is appropriate to question. You then have to  question in front of a prescribed authority who is a former judicial officer, a retired judge, and  the only point I make is that there are very significant limitations on how long that can occur.     

 In France, the judge who deals with terrorist issues is in a position to hold people, I think, for  up to two years and the fact is that the judge who deals with these issues merely has to make a  determination that somebody can help him in relation to his inquiries and he can continue to  hold them.  So France is dealing with this individual with far greater powers that have been  given to any authority in Australia to be able to deal with these issues.    

 That's a matter that I'm reviewing because it is quite clear that the parliamentary discussion  and debate led to some quite significant limitations on the extent to which the powers can be  used.  Now, people say that's an appropriate balance.  One of the limitations is that, of course,  in order to make inquiries it has to be in relation to a terrorist organisation and the procedures  we've put in place to deal with the identification of terrorist organisations requires that it be  first identified by the Security Council of the United Nations and- -   

 QUESTION:  Are  you  suggesting  that  those  restrictions,  those  restricted  powers  here   interfered with the arrest of this Frenchman?   

 PHILIP RUDDOCK: I'm saying that we do not have the powers that they have in France to  be able to detain people for the purposes of questioning, that they have in France.  That's the  only point I'm making.  The powers that we have, have been very significantly circumscribed  by the requirements that the Parliament sought when the legislation was debated.   

 The point I'm making is that yes, I am looking at the extent to which the powers which have  been considerably enhanced might require further enhancement and one of the issues that is of  concern to me is that terrorist organisations can only be subject to proscription by regulation  if  they've  been  identified  by  the  Security  Council  of  the  United  Nations  and  yet  there  are  

 

 6 

 organisations that I see the Labor Party arguing that ought to be proscribed but which the only  way in which we can deal with them is to introduce an individual bill into the Parliament as  we  did  with  Hizbollah  and  I've  made  it  clear  that  I  would  certainly  like  to  see  a  situation   where  the  government  of  the  day  would  be  in  a  far  more  flexible  position  to  be  able  to   proscribe organisations that are believed to be terrorist organisations than we have now, when  we  have  to  go  the  Parliament  by  way  of  an  individual  bill  with  the  potential  for  delay,  as   parliamentary committees undertook inquiries which would be very different to the situation  that exists in most other European countries.    

 QUESTION: Is there any evidence that this arrest and the raids that happened yesterday,  stopped something happening in Sydney or Australia, be it an attack - what did it stop?   

 PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  The  point  I  would  make  is  that  in  relation  to  these  matters  you   endeavour  to  get  intelligence  information  as  discreetly  as  you  can  to  be  able  to  hinder  any   operation  that  might  be  being  planned  and  to  deal  with  in  accordance  with  the  law  any   offences  that  might  have  been  committed.   And  you  do  that  through  the  inquiries  that  you   seek to undertake and the cooperation that you have with the security organisations and law  enforcement bodies.   

 When  the  information  is  in  public  domain  you're  operating  in  a  very  different  way  and  the   only  point  I'd  make  is  that  the  fact  that  you  have  been  undertaking  inquiries,  that  you're   exercising warrants, can have an impact on the way in which people who may have intended  to be involved in a terrorist act, it may hinder their involvement in those activities.   

 If I can use an example, there were a number of - they were described as raids but they were  warrants executed by ASIO to search and this was in relation to people who were known to  have  links  with  Jemaah  Islamiyah  and  the  fact  is  that  a  number  of  those  people  who  were   involved with Jemaah Islamiyah, when it became clear that they were under surveillance, left  Australia and I think, given the nature of those linkages we are better off because they have  left Australia.   

 What  we're  seeking  to  do  here  is  to  ensure  that  the  situation  which  is  going  to  come  up   because of what happened in France, that the people who may have had some linkages with  this gentleman in Australia would be aware that they were under surveillance.    

 QUESTION: Are you saying that the operation has been jeopardised?   

 PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  It's  a  matter  of  judgment  in  relation  to  these  matters  as  to  how  you   proceed and the only point I would make is that the judgment usually is that it is preferable to  be able to make discreet inquiries without the people who are the subject of those inquiries  always being aware that they're being undertaken.  I can't comment on whether or not these  matters  might  have  been  conducted  more  effectively  if  it  hadn't  been  subject  to  the  French   reporting.  I mean, that's the judgment that was made in France.   

 QUESTION: (Inaudible)   

 PHILIP RUDDOCK: No, I'm saying judgments had to be made as to- -   

 QUESTION: (Inaudible)  PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  No,  I  make  a  judgment  as  to  when  it  is  appropriate  to  make   information  public  and  I  do  that  in  concert  with  the  organisations  that  report  to  me.   We   certainly  took  the  view  that  as  we  were  undertaking  a  number  of  visits  yesterday,  under  

 

 7 

 warrants,  that  that  would  have  become  publicly  known.   That's  the  reason  I  made  the   announcement.   

 QUESTION: Minister, you're the only point of contact between [indistinct]- -   

 PHILIP RUDDOCK: And I've given you the basic facts.   

 QUESTION:  Is  it  possible  -  you're  implying  here  that  Mr  Brigette  may  have  been   involved in [indistinct].   

 PHILIP RUDDOCK: My expectations are not something that would be subject of reporting.   I have, as the principal law officer of the Commonwealth, to work with competent authorities  who deal with these issues and if a person is going to be arrested there has to be a reasonable  suspicion  that  they  have  committed  an  offence  which  can  give  rise  to  that  and  that's  in  the   hands of the competent authorities.  It's not in my hands.  So my expectations are irrelevant.    

 In relation to extradition, if somebody has committed an offence in Australia or even if they  commit  an  offence  outside  of  Australia  that  involves  a  breach  of  our  law  in  relation  to   terrorism, it can lead to extradition and we have extradition treaties with numbers of countries  around the world and we are expanding those arrangements and so clearly, yes, if there is an  offence  for  which  somebody  could  be  charged  in  Australia,  and  extradition  covers  it,  we   would seek to use the relevant provisions to bring him here for the purposes of pursuing those  charges.   

 QUESTION: (Inaudible)   

 PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  The  advice  that  I  have  is  that  we  were  informed  by  the  French   authorities  of  the  nature  of  the  training  that  he  had  been  involved  with  broadly  and  that  he   may have been seeking to use those skills, those attributes through his presence in Australia.   That's all I can say.     

 If you look at the French news reports they make some further suggestions.  I can't comment  on those.  I don't know the efficacy of them but the fact is that the intelligence authorities here  have  taken  this  matter  very,  very  seriously.   This  has  been  a  matter  of  very  high  level   cooperation between Commonwealth and state officials and I think you can deduce from that  that this is not an issue the government or its agencies have taken lightly.   

 QUESTION: (Inaudible)   

 PHILIP RUDDOCK: The reason is quite clear.  If you have laws that we have - we do have  laws - that only allow people to be arrested and detained when they've committed a criminal  offence,  mere  suspicion  is  not  going  to  enable  you  to  hold  them.   There  are  laws  that  deal   with questioning detention but they are quite constrained, as I mentioned.  He had breached  visa  conditions.   His  visa  was  cancelled  because  he  breached  visa  conditions.   He  was   removed from Australia and he is now held in France where they have a much wider range of  powers in relation to holding people than we do.   

 QUESTION: How had he breached visa conditions?  PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  Anybody  who  comes  to  Australia  with  a  visa  that  prohibits   employment and is found working breaches a visa condition.   

 QUESTION: And what was he working as?

 PHILIP RUDDOCK: I don't have the details but the advice that's been given to me is that he  was found to be in gainful employment and his visa prohibited it.   

 QUESTION: (Inaudible)   

 PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  The  advice  I  have  is  that  -  the  words  that  were  used  were  very   deliberate.  It was Pakistan and/or Afghanistan.  All right?   

 QUESTION: He was 35 years old?   

 PHILIP RUDDOCK: The advice I have is that he's in his middle thirties and he's a French  national and I think there are some news reports from France which will give you more detail  about his background.   

 QUESTION: And did he enter Australia under his own name?   

 PHILIP RUDDOCK: He entered Australia under his own name, as I understand it.   

 QUESTION:  And  the  raids  that  happened  yesterday,  was  any  property  seized  in  those   raids?  PHILIP RUDDOCK: The warrants were to search premises - property and motor vehicles -  and the warrants were executed and that is as it should be.    

 QUESTION: You can't say if any property- -   

 PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  I  think  it's  quite  undesirable  for  me  to  say  other  than  there  are   continuing inquiries, warrants were lawfully executed  and  that's  just  you  would  expect  it  to   be.   

 QUESTION: Can you say how many properties were raided?   

 PHILIP RUDDOCK: I can say that there were a large number of warrants issued relating to  a number of people and the warrants were multiple because they involved premises, property,  motor vehicles.   

 QUESTION: (Inaudible)   

 PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  There's  a  minister  who  has  responsibility  for  those  matters.   Let  me   just say that in relation to the particular matter, if people seek to bring an action in relation to  the  Commonwealth  exercising  its  lawful  powers  under  statute  then  any  action  will  be   vigorously  defended.   If  they're  seeking  to  bring  it  through  the  court,  unlike  those  who  are   advocating,  who  won't  be  seeking  to  conduct  it  in  the  public  arena,  we  would  put  our   arguments before the court.     

 QUESTION: Were these homes and businesses or just homes?   

 PHILIP RUDDOCK: I think that's a level of detail that it would be quite inappropriate for  me to take any further.     

 QUESTION: (Inaudible)

 PHILIP  RUDDOCK:  Look,  when  you  are  a  minister,  you  exercise  certain  authority  in   accordance  with  the  law  and  the  fact  is  that  the  Migration  Act  provides  a  basis  to  which   people who enter Australia without lawful authority, that is, without a visa, will be dealt with  and the Commonwealth behaves lawfully and I act in relation to my particular responsibilities  with advice and when I was acting in relation to other portfolios, again, with proper advice,  but it is the- -
