  Unlawful arrivals returned to Bangladesh

  

  MPS 78/98 

  

  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
said  today 15 people who arrived in Australia unlawfully by boat 
have been returned to Bangladesh at the weekend. 

  

 The group of 15 adult 
males arrived at Ashmore Reef aboard two small boats in May. 

  

 "These people travelled 
to Australia without visas and had no legal claim to remain in Australia," 
Mr Ruddock said. 

  

 "It is unfortunate 
that people who may already be economically disadvantaged have again 
lost substantial sums of money to individuals organising such travel 
when there was no real chance of them being allowed to stay in Australia. 

  

 "Entry to Australia 
in these circumstances is illegal, and the Australian Government urges 
those wanting to migrate to or visit this country to apply through official 
channels. 

  

 "The Australian 
Government has no desire to keep unauthorised arrivals in detention 
for any longer than is necessary and this is evidenced by the quick 
and effective removal of this group of people who had no claim to be 
in Australia," Mr Ruddock said. 

  

 The removal of the illegal 
arrivals follows the return of 15 other boat arrivals to Bangladesh 
four weeks ago. This brings to 354 the number of unauthorised boat arrivals 
removed from Australia in the past 12 months.
