 Seeking asylum a human right, not illegal   

 Greens  Senator  Sarah  Hanson-Young  has  demanded  a  re-think  of  the  way  Australia   considers asylum seekers, with a reminder that fleeing persecution and seeking refuge  is a human right enshrined in international law.   

 Some recent media reports have stated that ‘illegal migrants’ have been intercepted on  the way to Australia.   

 “The  myth  that  asylum  seekers  are illegal  immigrants  must no  longer  be  perpetuated,”  said Senator Hanson-Young.   

 “A term like ‘illegals’ is not only offensive, but also inaccurate.   

 “It is not illegal to arrive in this country without a visa.”   

 Senator Hanson-Young said that Australia had a responsibility to assist asylum seekers.   

 “As  a  signatory  to  the  1951  United  Nations  Geneva  Convention  on  Refugees,  and  a   country  that  considers  itself  compassionate  and  a  champion  of  the  ‘fair  go’,  Australia   must step up to its international obligations and reputation and swiftly consider asylum  seekers for refugee status.”   

 Senator  Hanson-Young  expressed  concern  about  offshore  processing  of  asylum   seekers in locations such as Christmas Island.   

 “The Greens and human rights organisations alike are concerned about the ‘out of sight,  out of mind’ approach to treating people who arrive by boat,” she said.   

 “The current policy is sustaining a two-class scheme of refugees, with those who arrive  by boat severely disadvantaged compared to others.   

 “The  negative  physical  and  mental  impact  of  detaining  people  in  extremely  remote   detention centres is undeniable.”   

 Senator  Hanson-Young  said  that  the  Australian  Government  and  community  should   reserve their judgement on asylum seekers until their checks had been completed and  they had either been granted asylum or not.   

 “Asylum  seekers  who  arrive  by  boat  must  be  treated  like  any  other  individual  seeking   asylum in Australia, and undergo identity, health and security checks promptly and fairly.   

 “While others continue to peddle a myth of fear around asylum seekers, the Greens will  continue to campaign for a fairer, more compassionate Australia,” she said.   

 Senator Hanson-Young will be attending the Migration Joint Standing Committee’s Inquiry  hearing into Immigration Detention in Perth and will be available for comment.  When: Thursday 9 October (9.15am - 1pm)  Where: Legislative Assembly, Committee Office Room No. 2, 1/11 Harvest Terrace, West Perth
