 TITLE:    Doorstop, Sydney.   

 Topics:  Relationship with Indonesia, East Timor, NSW State Liberals.    

 

 MR DOWNER:  I thought I’d better say a little bit about my meetings yesterday -  perhaps first with the Singapore Government and more with Hassam Wirijuda, the Indonesian  Foreign Minister last night - while I was in Singapore for a bilateral visit with the Singapore  Government following their elections. I had dinner with the Indonesian Foreign Minister and  some of his officials. I guess the dinner went for about 3 - 3 and a half hours. It was I think  very important that we didn’t just talk on the telephone, which we have done a little bit since  the decision was made to grant asylum to the 42 Papuans. This meeting followed on from the  visit on the 21st of April to Jakarta by Michael L’Estrange, the Secretary of my Department.  The meeting was a very constructive and very positive meeting - both of us agreed on the  importance of the bilateral relationship. We both agreed that Indonesia gained a great deal out  of a good and constructive relationship with Australia. We likewise gain a good deal out of a  good and constructive relationship with Indonesia. So, we both absolutely recognise the  strength to both of our countries coming from the bilateral relationship and we did agree that  therefore we need to take things forward and we look forward fairly soon to a meeting  between President Yudohoyno and Prime Minister John Howard. But, I think overall, without  going into too many details about the meeting - I don’t want to do that - it was a very  constructive meeting. Obviously, the Indonesians are pleased with the broad approach that  Australia is taking to the question of asylum seekers. I think they understand the obligations  we have under the 1951 United Nationas Convention on Refugees. They understand of course  that we’re making some changes to our legislation here in Australia, which will provide for  processing in Nauru and, for people who have at least arrived by boat. I think frankly, but  more broadly, the important thing that has come out of the meeting is that we’ve re-enforced  the importance to each other of our bilateral relationships. We need to take the relationship  forward and that’s of course ultimately what’s going to count here.     

 JOURNALIST:  Is the relationship back on track, would you say that?   

 MR DOWNER:  Let me put it to you this way - I think perhaps more in Indonesia than  here, but there is - there are sensitive political issues in Indonesia and I’m going to be very  cautious in what I say because I don’t want what I say to play into their domestic political

 sensitivities - but I think people can take comfort from the fact that the Indonesian Foreign  Minister and the Indonesian Government very much values its relationship with Australia and  is obviously in agreement with us that we need to take things forward over the years. So,  overall, this was a very successful meeting, I’m glad we were able to do it, and to do it in such  a friendly and warm atmosphere as well.   

 JOURNALIST:  What about the issue of the Ambassador?   

 MR DOWNER:  Well look, that’s not a matter for us. Our Ambassador is in Jakarta - he  was at the meeting last night actually, at the dinner last night - but our Ambassador is back in  Jakarta now. We have our Ambassador in Jakarta to represent our interests and it’s for  Indonesia how it wants to structure it’s representation in Australia. There’s no doubt the  Indonesian Ambassador will be coming back. The timing of that and how they handle that is a  matter of domestic sensitivity for them, and I will leave all of that to them. We had some  discussion about that but I’m certainly not getting into that. It’s a matter for them. But, of  course the Indonesians Ambassador will be coming back, and you know, their Ambassador  represents their interests, not ours - our Ambassador represents our interests - and this  obviously is a matter for them. 

 

 JOURNALIST:  (Inaudible) Jakarta?   

 MR DOWNER:  Well I think the sign of goodwill is there. I think the fact that the dinner  took place, that it was in such a friendly and warm atmosphere - two friends getting together  again. We’ve done so many things over so many years, Hassan Wirajuda and I. We’re  confident that we’re making progress in fixing up this particular problem. We will have many 

 problems ahead of us to deal with the way over and above this one, but I think the really good  sign is that we had a truly constructive dinner together and we are both committed to taking  the relationship forward. We look forward to a meeting before too long between President  Yudohoyno and the Prime Minister. Now, I keep saying that, but let me put that into some  context. The process that we identified a little while ago was that we would first of all; send  Michael L’Estrange, the Secretary of my Department, to Jakarta for talks - and that was done.  We agreed that it would be a good idea for the two Foreign Ministers to get together, that was  done in a particularly constructive way last night and the next phase will be the meeting  between the Prime Minister and the President - we hope that will happen before too long.   

 

 JOURNALIST:  Your critics will be saying that you’ve pandered to them by changing  the immigration legislation, and now they’ve put the Ambassador returning back on the table?   

 MR DOWNER:  Well I don’t know why you’re interested - if I may say so with the  greatest of respect for you - well not you, my critics if you like, would be so interested in the  issue of the Ambassador returning because that’s not really a matter for us. He’s not our  Ambassador, he’s their Ambassador - he represents their interests, he doesn’t represent our  interests so I’ve made the point their Ambassador is coming back, so to suggest he’s not  coming back, well my critics would be wrong, as of course they usually are. The Ambassador  will be coming back, but the timing of his return is something that is a sensitive matter for the  Indonesians and I’m not going to get into elaborating on that. 

 JOURNALIST:  Will the Prime Minister go to Jakarta for that meeting? 

 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 3

 

 MR DOWNER:  It’s unlikely it will actually be in Jakarta, although, it could be in  Indonesia.   

 

 JOURNALIST:  When will that occur, do you know?   

 MR DOWNER:  It will occur fairly soon.     

 JOURNALIST:  (Inaudible) Howard’s return to Australia (inaudible)?   

 MR DOWNER:  No. (Inaudible) to organise.   

 JOURNALIST:  Regarding the billion dollars Australia has put towards tsunami relief  effort, (inaudible) lost throughout this process?   

 MR DOWNER:  I actually don’t think it has been lost. I think you need to understand  this is a difficult political issue for the Indonesians as it is for us actually. Let’s not pretend.  It’s a difficult political issue for them as it is for us, and we need to work through this. I think  the thing you’ve got to remember is that two countries, like Australia and Indonesia, which  are very different in so many ways, but live side by side and always, will, will from time to  time have difficulties. The important thing is that we can work through those difficulties 

 relatively quickly and move on. Now, you know, the Prime Minister has a very good  relationship with President Yudohoyno and I count Hassan Wirajuda as a very good friend  and we get on very well with each other and have done a lot of things together. So, but in the  long term, you know, years out from now, the relationship will have to depend more on the  friendships between our leaders - it will have to depend ultimately on a recognition across the  political spectrums in Australia and Indonesia, of the common interest our two countries have  in working constructively together. You will never have a situation where there aren’t  problems that come up from time to time. The important thing is that we manage them. Now,  we have to manage this issue according to our law, and consistent with the dignity of our  country. But we have to be conscious of political issues within Indonesia. This whole question  of Papua is a very live and sensitive political issue - they know that we don’t support  secessionism in Papua, they know we support Indonesian territorial integrity, including  Indonesia’s sovereignty over Papua but this is of course a very sensitive question in Jakarta -and we have to bear that in mind.   

 JOURNALIST:  But that billion dollars in generosity, is it that generosity that’s been  forgotten (inaudible)?    

 MR DOWNER:  No, I don’t think it has. I think they clearly remember that and I think  there are - as was demonstrated in our discussions last night - enormous underlying strengths  in the relationship. My point is only that there is difficulty from time to time - there’s no  question of that, of course. But from time to time there will be difficulties, but the underlying  strength of the relationship needs to be consolidated and I think, you know, the support by  Australians for the tsunami victims is an important part of that. But let me make another point  - Australians didn’t support the tsunami victims for reasons beyond humanitarian reasons -  whether people are from Indonesia or whether they’re from Burkina Faso, or Paraguay or 

 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 4

 Britain or wherever they’re from - they’re part of the human race and if they get into strife  it’s going to be the natural instinct of Australians to provide support.    JOURNALIST:  (Inaudible) provide a comment?   

 MR DOWNER:  Well, I’ve not been focussing on that - that’s a matter for the  parliamentary party. Obviously I’ll discuss that at an appropriate time. I think Amanda  Vanstone’s had a meeting with a backbench committee - I wasn’t at the meeting so you’ll  have to ask her about the details of that meeting - and then they’ll be a party meeting and this  legislation will go through the normal processes within the party. So, let them take their  course.   

 JOURNALIST:  Given the sensitivities in Indonesia, another boat load of Papuans,  would that be the end of diplomatic relations do you think?    

 MR DOWNER:  Well I don’t expect it would, because of the systems that we’ve put in  place. I think the Indonesians recognise that what we don’t want - I mean, you know, some  people make the point we’re just doing all of these things to appease the Indonesians - we’re  not. We’re doing these things in our own interests. What we don’t want is the natural  goodwill of Australians to be exploited by a political campaign. So where people are, if you  like, sincere and genuine refugees, then processing will determine that. But if they want to  make a political point by making applications, we don’t want to make that any easier than we  need to. Otherwise Australia will be hostage to - you know, Papua might be the issue now -  but to a whole series of different campaigns through that process. I wouldn’t say over the  years we haven’t from time to time had that problem, but I would say that we don’t want our  country to be hostage to campaigns on issues of one kind or another and made hostage by the  exploitation of our generosity by our commitment to the 1951 Refugee Convention. At the  same time, we don’t want to abrogate or turn our back on our humanitarian obligations under  the 1951 Refugee Convention. I think this change to the law is a good way of us finding the  right balance there. We don’t have a choice between the perfect and the imperfect - we have a  couple of difficult choices to make here and I think bearing in mind the difficult choices we  have to make that’s a good solution.  

 

 JOURNALIST:  Mr Downer, currently there is speculation, (inaudible)?   

 MR DOWNER:  I’m very interested in being the Foreign Minister. I’m working on - I  think rather successfully I hope - working on fixing up this particular issue. I’m going to the  Solomon Islands on Friday, there’s a bit of difficulty over there, as everybody knows. I’m  pretty much in contact daily with the East Timorese because there’s a situation under way  there. I’ve got much more important things to do with my time than engage in that sort of  speculation.    

 I saw that Piers Ackerman wrote an article - I read this article, then I heard that television  stations were running it as their lead story - that Piers Ackerman said that the Prime Minister  is going to stand down in December. I think to myself - I mean, you know, I love the media  and I always think it’s unworthy of politicians to spend too much time criticising the media,  but boy - that story was well and truly over the top. I think Mr Howard will make up his own 

 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 5

 mind about these things, but just to run a big story on the back of a columnist making some  comments, that’s out there a bit.    

 JOURNALIST:  Don’t you ever get tired though of all the world travel and think  wouldn’t it be nice sitting back and....   

 MR DOWNER:  … what, to be the Prime Minister?   

 JOURNALIST:  (Inaudible) good enough to win the next election?   

 MR DOWNER:  Well look, I mean, I think the Government is just going exceptionally  well at the moment. One day inevitably John Howard will retire. When that day comes he’ll  announce it. But I don’t think he’s going to foreshadow that, either through a newspaper  column in the Sunday Telegraph - I’m absolutely sure he wouldn’t foreshadow it that way -  and I don’t think he’s going to get into speculation about it.  

 

 JOURNALIST:  (Inaudible) leadership?   

 MR DOWNER:  I think he would, yes.   

 JOURNALIST:  (Inaudible)   

 MR DOWNER:  I didn’t enjoy it very much when I did it, and I wasn’t very good at it.  But I’ve been much better as the Foreign Minister.    

 JOURNALIST:  As the Foreign Minister you obviously have a lot to do with counter-terrorism areas and terrorism issues. One of your State coalition Liberal Party colleagues,  Andrew Humpherson, today labelled the exercise happening in Sydney today involving  Federal and State Governments major counter-terrorism exercise as a PR stunt. Do you think  that an exercise involving the army (inaudible) a PR stunt?  

 

 MR DOWNER:  I think exercises to deal with counter-terrorism are enormously  important. You see, if we don’t do any exercises and there’s a terrorist attack and there’s  chaos in response to it, people will say, well why didn’t you conduct exercises before and  prepare yourself? Governments should always do their best to make sure they’re ready for the  worst. That’s not to say we think the worst is about to happen. It’s not that we think there’s  going to be a terrorist attack on Sydney tomorrow, because, you know, we always say - be  alert, not alarmed. But, I think it is just important to make sure that we take appropriate  preparations - I haven’t heard what he’s said, so I’m not familiar with that. 

 

 JOURNALIST:  Is he out of line?   

 MR DOWNER:  I haven’t heard what he said - I’m not going to run a story criticising  the state Liberals, I’m just going to run a story saying I think in terms of counter-terrorism,  federal government does a very good job and we obviously have to cooperate with state  governments in that process. But I haven’t seen what he’s said.

 JOURNALIST:  Do you guys just end up shaking your head at what the State Liberals  here in New South Wales are doing?   

 MR DOWNER:  I think they’re doing better than state Labor are doing, tell you that.  They’re doing better than State Labor. I shake my head coming in the car from the airport,  listening to all of the things that are going wrong on a state level in New South Wales and  think that it’s time to have a change of state government here, that’s what I think.   

 JOURNALIST:  And Minister, just wondering if you might be able to brief us about the  situation in East Timor, (inaudible) in a position to be able to deal with any trouble should it  arise? 

 

 MR DOWNER:  Well, they will be. And I’m not so pessimistic that I think trouble is  going to arise - but we certainly need to be in a position where, should it happen - and I think  that is unlikely - but should it happen we can help evacuate people - of course, first and  foremost Australians - but other foreigners. And secondly, any time the East Timor  government or the United Nations asked us to contribute to stability again in East Timor we’d  obviously look favourably on that request - it would depend on the circumstances of it, and  we would be in a position to be able to do something rather quickly because we’ve - you  know, it’s the same point I’m making earlier - we’ve made preparations. That’s not to say  we’re likely to have to send any of our military to East Timor - I think that’s much less likely  than likely - but at least we’ve made preparations in case there’s a problem. Now they have a  Fretilin - which is the ruling party there - Party Conference, which begins tomorrow and  which runs through to the weekend, and that’s obviously going to be a high profile political  event. We hope that everybody will handle, not just the conference itself, but the events  surrounding the conference, and peacefully and constructively within the traditions of  democracy and consistent within East Timorese law, but if things go wrong well then it’s  important there are preparations there.     

 ENDS.
