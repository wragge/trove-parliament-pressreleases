 SENATOR KATE LUNDY   MINISTER FOR MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 20 June 2012   

 BOOST TO SETTLEMENT SERVICES FOR NEW  MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES    

 The Federal Government’s latest round of settlement grants reinforces its commitment  to help newly arrived migrants and refugees become self-reliant and successfully settle  in Australia, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister  for Multicultural Affairs, Senator Kate Lundy, said today.   

 Mr Bowen said the services funded under the program focused on assisting new arrivals  to gain employment and access to education and training, but also included sporting  activities, help to increase knowledge of Australian culture and navigating the rental  market.   

 “Settlement services make a very real difference to the lives of many of our new  arrivals, helping them to adjust to life in Australia and contribute to the community,” Mr  Bowen said.    

 “This is about getting people ready for work, getting kids into school, and making sure  they have every opportunity to make a success of life in Australia, further enhancing the  productivity of our migration program.”   

 From 1 July 2012, a total of 97 new projects worth $39 million - and delivered through  95 organisations - will be funded under the 2012-13 Settlement Grants Program (SGP).  The SGP aims to help humanitarian entrants and new migrants to acquire the skills and  knowledge to fully participate in the community as soon as possible after arrival.     

 Senator Lundy said the SGP reaffirmed the Australian Government’s commitment to  helping refugees and migrants successfully settle into their new communities.   

 “These services help people to make the transition into Australian life by building on  their existing skills and, at the same time, help them to learn valuable new ones,”  Senator Lundy said.    

 “They provide practical assistance for people starting new lives in Australia, help them  create valuable links to the wider community, and empower migrants and refugees to  become self-reliant so they can forge a better life.”   

 Some of the successful applicant organisations include migrant resource centres,  multicultural service agencies, educational institutions, community groups and welfare  organisations.   

 A complete list of successful SGP applicants in the 2012-13 funding round is available on  the Department of Immigration and Citizenship website at www.immi.gov.au/living-in-australia/delivering-assistance/settlement-grants
