 JULIA GILLARD M.P.   

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration   

 STATEMENT BY JULIA GILLARD   SHADOW MINISTER FOR POPULATION & IMMIGRATION   IN RESPONSE TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH REPORT,   “BY INVITATION ONLY”   

 Human Rights Watch, the New York-based international monitoring agency,  released a report today in Sydney based on interviews with people who were on  boats turned away by the Royal Australian Navy.   

 The Report contains some serious allegations.  These allegations were also raised at a  recent Senate Inquiry, but that inquiry could not collect testimony from the asylum  seekers involved.   

 Responding to the report, Julia Gillard, the Shadow Minister for Population and  Immigration, stated that Labor has consistently maintained that Australians are  entitled to the truth about all aspects of the Howard Government’s ‘Pacific Solution’  and all matters relating to its treatment of asylum seekers and refugees. 

 

 Labor has consistently maintained that there is no need to lie to protect our borders  and that Australians were entitled to the full truth about the ‘Children Overboard’  conspiracy, the full details of the costs and impacts of the ‘Pacific Solution’, the full  story of SIEV X, and full details of the disruption activities undertaken in Indonesia. 

 

 Labor has led the way in seeking to drag the truth from a reluctant Government.   Today, Labor has continued its campaign to hold the Government to account by  successfully moving a motion in the Senate calling on the Government to institute an  independent judicial inquiry into the Government’s people-smuggling disruption  program, including the circumstances of the loss of SIEV X.   

 Such a judicial inquiry would be the appropriate place to deal with the allegations  made in the Human Rights Watch report.
