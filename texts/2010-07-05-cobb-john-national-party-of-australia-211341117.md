 Stop the boats, stop the deaths and stop the illegal  trade   05-July-2010  Written by: John Cobb, MP -  

 Federal Rounds - Stop the boats, stop the deaths and stop the illegal trade  Three months ago I said in a press release that I will proudly take the Coalition’s  record and policy on immigration and human trafficking to the election and, after a  week when those two issues have been back in the headlines, I happily stand by that  statement.  Back in April Kevin Rudd had just appointed Tony Burke to the position of Minister  for Population and that was apparently going to make a difference. Three months  and dozens of boats later Tony Burke is Minister for “Sustainable Population” and  nothing much has changed. People smugglers are putting more lives at risk because  Australia is an easy target.  The Coalition Government found a problem and created a solution.  The boats stopped coming. Since then Labor’s policies have continued to change on  the run, knee-jerk reaction after knee-jerk reaction. There was never any plan or any  process and this remains the case.  Labor found a solution and created a problem.  Australians want strength and leadership on the issue. Along with Canada, Australia  is second on the list of countries which accept refugees. There is a process, there  are queues and there are refugees who genuinely and tragically need to leave their  homes. Apart from that Australians want the right to chose who comes to our great  country.  However there are also people smugglers, illegal traffickers and people dying on the  high seas. This is a deadly industry. The Coalition remains committed to a strong  focus on skilled migration with a clear resolve on ending the criminal trade of human  trafficking. We have made tough decisions in the past and there has been criticism  from certain commentators and certain groups amongst the community but there has  always been a plan.  There are refugees and migrants living in Calare. It’s part of why there is no better  place to live. This debate is not about race. It is about preventing death and stopping  an illegal process that claims lives - an estimated 170 people have died at sea  attempting to come to Australia since Labor unwound the Coalition’s strong policies*.  So far, 143 boats have arrived in the same time and a very high number of children  are now in detention. These are points that no amount of spin or polish can mask. 

 I want to see Australia with strong borders, I want to see skilled immigration that  improves our nation and improves Calare. This is the policy of the Coalition and this  is the policy I will take with me to the election. I am proud that we stopped the boats  and I am confident that if we return to Government we will stop the deaths and stop  the people smugglers once more.  *Figures from Andrew Bolt - Herald Sun 2/7/2010
