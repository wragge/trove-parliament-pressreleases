 LAST ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM DARWIN BOAT DEPORTED

 All 146 people posing as refugees from Vietnam who arrived  by fishing boat in Darwin in October have now been  deported. The last 15 were sent to Taiwan on a Qantas  flight from Sydney today.

 Of the others, 127 were deported from Darwin by Qantas  charter on 27 December, six going to Hong Kong and the  rest to Taiwan, and a further four were deported to Taiwan  from Sydney on 8 March.

 "This successful exercise, culminating in the deportation  of all 146 people from the boat, will serve as a warning  to anyone thinking of trying to enter. Australia illegally",  the Minister for Immigration and.Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian  Macphee, said today. "Let them take note that the same 

 action will be taken against anyone trying a similar  venture. "

 Intensive investigations had -begun as soon as the fishing ;   boat VT838 arrived in Darwin on 5 October. Questioning  of the passengers and inquiries overseas "revealed that  they were not Vietnamese "boat.people", but had paid large 

 sums to a syndicate operation planned"in Hong Kong.
