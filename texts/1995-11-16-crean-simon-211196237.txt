  INTRODUCTION 

  IT IS A GREAT PLEASURE TO OPEN THE 16TH NATIONAL FECCA CONFERENCE. 

  I ADDRESSED THIS AUDIENCE IN SEPTEMBER LAST YEAR AT FECCA 'S 

  EMPLOYMENT CONFERENCE. AT THAT TIME I DETAILED THE FEDERAL 

  LABOR GOVERNMENT'S COMMITMENT UNDER WORKING NA TION TO MIGRANT 

  JOBSEEKERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE FROM A NON ENGLISH SPEAKING 

  BACKGROUND . 

  SINCE THEN I HAVE LAUNCHED , TOGETHER WITH THE MINISTER FOR 

  IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS NICK BOLKUS, THE WORKING NATION 

  COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY FOR NESB MIGRANTS . I HAVE ATTENDED 

  NUMEROUS ETHNIC BUSINESS WORKING NATION BREAKFASTS. I HAVE ALSO 

  BEEN TO GRADUATIONS OF UNEMPLOYED MIGRANTS WHO HAVE 

  ESTABLISHED THEIR OWN SMALL BUSINESS UNDER WORKING NATION- AND 

  ALSO MET WITH VARIOUS ETHNIC LEADERS TO DISCUSS HOW WORKING 

  NATION CAN BE IMPROVED . 

  THIS IS ALL PART OF THE GENUINE COMMITMENT OF THE FEDERAL LABOR 

  GOVERNMENT TO OPEN AND FRANK DIALOGUE AND INFORMATION 

  EXCHANGE . 

  WHEN WE SAY WE WILL DO THINGS -WE DO THEM. AND DOING THINGS IS 

  NOT ABOUT POLITICS NOR IS IT EMPTY WORDS. IT IS ABOUT CONTRIBUTING 

  TO A SOCIETY BASED ON EQUITY , DIVERSITY AND OPPORTUNITY- OVER THE 

  LONG TERM . 

  WORKING NATION 

  GETTING UNEMPLOYMENT DOWN AND CREATING JOBS REMAINS ONE OF THE 

  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S HIGHEST PRIORITIES . 

  2. 

  WORKING NA TION IS A PU BLIC COMM ITM ENT BA C KED BY $9 BILLIO N OVER 4 

  YEARS TO ENSURE THOS E MOST DIS A DV ANTAGE D IN THE LABOUR MARKET 

  ARE NOT LEFT BEHIND . 

  EXPERJENCE HAS SHOWN THAT UNLESS MEASURES ARE TARGETED AT LONG 

  TERM UNEMPLOYED JOBSEEKERS , INCLUDING THOSE FROM A NON ENGLISH 

  SPEAKING BACKGROUND. THEY WILL BE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE 

  FOR JOBS. 

  THIS EXPERJENCE UNDERPINS WORKI N G NATION WHICH HAS A MIGRANT 

  SERVICE IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY AS A CENTRAL FOCUS. THIS ADDRESSES 

  THE SPECIFIC BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT FACED BY NESB MIGRANTS IN 

  PARTICULAR (see attachment). 

  PROGRESS REPORT 

  GIVEN FECCA'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF WORKING NATION 

  FOR MIGRANTS IT IS APPROPRJATE TO CONSIDER PROGRESS AGAINST THE 

  OBJECTIVES SET LAST YEAR . 

  1. To reduce the level of migrant unemployment and forestall the flow of migrants into 

  long term unemployment. 

  IN MANY WAYS THIS REMAINS THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE FOR BOTH THE 

  GOVERNMENT AND ETHNIC COMMUNITIES. 

  SINCE WORKING NATION WAS INTRODUCED UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG 

  VARJOUS NESB MIGRANT GROUPS HAS FALLEN- OVERALL FROM 13.7% TO 

  12.6%. THE NUMBER OF LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED MIGRANTS HAS 

  DECREASED BY 22% AND THE NUMBER OF VERY LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED 

  MIGRANTS HAS FALLEN BY 23% . 

  3. 

  Iâ‘  I; I 

  UNEM PLOYMENT RATES AMONGST V ARlO US ETHN IC COMMUNIT Y GROUPS 

  HAVE ALS O FALLEN- FOR EXAMP LE FOR MIGRANTS FROM THE FORMER 

  SOVIET UN ION (24.5% TO 17.7%), FROM VIETNAM (31% TO 27.4%), FROM 

  GREECE (10.3% TO 7.9%) AN D FROM CHINA (11.9% TO 10.5%). 

  THESE RESULTS DEMO N STRATE THAT TA RGETED MEASURES DO WORK. 

  HOWEVER DESPITE THESE DOWNW A RD TRENDS UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS 

  UN ACCEPTABLY HIGH AN D THE GOVERNMENT REMAINS RESOLUTE IN ITS 

  COMMITMENT TO DOING BETTER. 

  THAT'S WHY WORKING NA TION IS A FOUR YEAR COMMITMENT. 

  2. To raise the level of awareness of CES programs and services in ethnic communities 

  and encourage migrants to register with the CES 

  AS A TARGET EQUITY GROUP , NESB MIGRANTS REPRESENT ABOUT 19% OF 

  THE CES REGISTER. AMONGST A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO MEET THIS 

  OBJECTIVE ARE : 

   " INFORMATION ON CES PROGRAMS IS NOW PROVIDED IN 22 LANGUAGES . 

   " VARIOUS INFORMATION FORUMS ON WO RKIN G NATIO N HAVE BEEN 

  SUCCESSFULLY RUN BY CES MIGRANT LIAISON OFFICERS. 

   " A SERIES OF SEGMENTS PRESENTED BY 2 VIETNAMESE MLO 's ON SBS 

  RADIO HAVE BEEN RUNNING FROM JULY; AND 

   " COMMUNITY AWARENESS TEAMS FROM 7 ETHNIC COMMUNITIES HAVE 

  ALSO BEEN ACTIVELY INFORMING PEOPLE A BOUT THE BENEFITS OF 

  WORKING NA TION. 

  4. 

  3. To improve migrant access to labour market programs and improve tlze job olllcomes of 

  migrants undertaking tlzem. 

  FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR TO JUNE 1995 THE NUMBER OF DISADVANTAGED 

  MIGRANTS IN UNSUBSIDISED EMPLOYMENT ROSE FROM 24% TO 28%. OVER 

  THE YEAR TO AUGUST 1995 NESB MIGRANTS IN THE JOB COMPACT (THOSE 

  WHO HAVE BEEN OUT OF WORK FOR 18 MONTHS OR MORE) WERE ACHIEVING 

  20% OF THE OUTCOMES UP FROM 17.4%. 

  THIS IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE WITH THE ENHANCEMENTS TO WORKING 

  NATION RECENTLY ANNOUNCED SUCH AS: 

   " JOBST ART SUBSIDIES FOR FAMILY MEMBERS; 

   " SUBSIDIES FOR CASUAL AND PART TIME WORKERS; 

   " SUBSIDIES FOR SHORTER TERM UNEMPLOYED JOBSEEKERS; AND 

   " MORE FLEXIBLE AND SPECIALISED SUPPORT FOR JOBSEEKERS WHO HAVE 

  EXTREME DIFFICULTY IN GETTING WORK BECAUSE THEY FACE MULTIPLE 

  BARRIERS. REFUGEES WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM TORTURE AND 

  TRAUMA WILL PARTICULARLY BENEFIT FROM THIS INITIATIVE. 

  4. To ensure that CES services and programs are responsive to the particular needs of 

  migrants 

  NESB SPECIFIC JOB CLUBS AND LABOUR MARKET PROGRAMS, SUCH AS LEAP, 

  NEW WORK OPPORTUNITIES , NEW ENTERPRISE INCENTIVE SCHEME (NEIS) 

  AND JOBSKILLS , ARE BEING RUN VERY SUCCESSFULLY. 

  OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS THE PARTICIPATION RATE FOR NESB 

  JOBSEEKERS IN JOB CLUBS HAS INCREASED FROM 6% TO 17%. THERE ARE 

  NOW 60 NESB SPECIFIC JOB CLUBS BEING RUN AROUND AUSTRALIA. 

  5. 

  THE 6 NE lS PILOTS ANNOUNCED AT FECCA LAST YEAR HAVE RESULTED IN 

  80% OF PARTICIP ANTS ARE NOW RUNNING THEIR OWN BUSINESS . 

  NElS IS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL LABOUR MARKET PROGRAMS RUN BY 

  MY DEPARTMENT. RECENT FIGURES INDICATE THAT 2 YEARS AFTER 

  COMPLETING NElS, 80% OF PARTICIPANTS ARE STILL IN UNSUBSIDISED 

  EMPLOYMENT. IN ADDITION FOR EVERY NElS BUSINESS ESTABLISHED A 

  FURTHERJOBISCREATED. 

  OF THE 7000 SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSES ESTABLISHED UNDER NElS SINCE 

  WORKING NATION33% ARE OWNED AND OPERATED BY MIGRANTS. THIS IS UP 

  FROM 20% THE YEAR BEFORE REFLECTING THE NATURAL AFFINITY 

  MIGRANTS HAVE WITH BUSINESS VENTURES. 

  5. To improve information exchange between my Department and ethnic communities 

  OVER THE PAST YEAR THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CONSULTING 

  EXTENSIVELY WITH ETHNIC COMMUNITIES THROUGH MIGRANT LIAISON 

  OFFICERS , AREA CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEES , MIGRANT ADVISORY 

  COMMITTEES AND GROUPS LIKE FECCA. 

  CONSULTATION IS EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IT CREATES PARTNERSHIPS BASED 

  ON A SHARED UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEMS AND A REALISATION 

  THAT WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO SOLVE UNEMPLOYMENT. 

  ETHNIC EMPLOYMENT LIAISON OFFICERS (ELO's) ARE ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS 

  PARTNERSHIP AT WORK. THESE OFFICERS ARE PLACED WITH COMMUNITY 

  GROUPS TO PROMOTE AND SUPPORT THE INVOLVEMENT OF ETHNIC 

  EMPLOYERS IN ACCESSING WORKING NATION INITIATIVES. 

  ELO's ARE CURRENTLY PLACED WITH FECCA, CO.AS.IT, THE CHINESE 

  ASSOCIATION OF VICTORIA , THE AUSTRALIAN VIETNAMESE SERVICES 

  6. 

  RESO U RCE CENTRE IN MELBOURNE. TH E \\ TE STERN AUSTRALIAN C HINESE 

  CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. THE A U STRALIAN CHINESE COMMUNITY 

  ASSOCIATION OF NSW AND THE SOUTH CENTRAL MIGRANT RESO U RCE 

  CENTRE IN MELBOURNE. 

  I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE TODAY A FURTHER 3 ELO 's ALL OF WHOM 

  HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO GENERATE FURTHER VACANCIES IN THEIR 

  COMMUNITIES: 

   " THE AUSTRALIAN ARABIC WELFARE ASSOCIATION IN SYDNEY; 

   " THE VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY IN AUSTRALIA IN NSW; AND 

   " THE JEWISH COMMUNITY SERVICES IN SYDNEY. 

  SUMMARY 

  THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE FIRST YEAR OF WORKING NATION HAS SEEN 

  SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SERVICES FOR NESB JOBSEEKERS AND 

  EMPLOYERS . 

  IT DEMONSTRATES THAT TARGETED MEASURES, SUCH AS ESL , CASE 

  MANAGEMENT AND MIGRANT LIAISON OFFICERS DO WORK . IT 

  DEMONSTRATES THAT WE HAVE DELIVERED. 

  THIS IS NOT TO DENY THAT THERE IS MUCH MORE TO BE DONE. BUT THIS IS 

  WHY WORKING NATION IS A FOUR YEAR STRATEGY AND WHY WE ARE 

  CONTINUALLY TALKING WITH INTERESTED PARTIES SUCH AS YOURSELVES 

  ABOUT HOW IT CAN BETTER FIT THE NEEDS. 

  7. 

  ENHANCE/1.1ENTS TO WORKING NATION FOR NESB JOBSEEKERS 

  Cltildcare Places for Disadvantaged Jobseekers 

  DURING MY CONSULTATIONS YOU IDENTIFIED THAT A NUMBER OF NESB 

  CLIENTS , PARTICULARLY WOMEN , HAVE NOT BEEN TAKING UP TRAINING 

  PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE ACCESS TO CHILD CARE. 

  IN RESPONSE TO THIS I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THE FEDERAL 

  GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE $8.5MILLION PER AL'-rnUM FOR TEMPORARY 

  CHILD CARE PLACES FOR DISADVANTAGED JOBSEEKERS WITH DEPENDENT 

  CHILDREN. IT IS EXPECTED THAT OVER 5,300 JOBSEEKERS WILL BENEFIT IN 

  ANY ONE YEAR. 

  THIS COMMITMENT IS IN ADDITION TO THAT MADE BY THE FEDERAL 

  GOVERNMENT IN THE BUDGET TO MEET WORK RELATED CHILD CARE 

  DEMAND BY 2001. 

  TO BE ELIGIBLE JOBSEEKERS MUST BE ON INCOME SUPPORT AND IN A 

  FORMAL TRAINING PROGRAM . 

  THIS GO SOME WAY TO REMOVING LACK OF CHILDCARE AS A BARRIER TO 

  RETURNING TO THE WORKFORCE. 

  Work Experience 

  YOU HAVE ALSO IDENTIFIED A NEED FOR EXTENDED WORK EXPERIENCE IN 

  ESL COURSES , CURRENTLY LIMITED TO 10 DAYS . 

  I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT AS FROM TODAY WORK EXPERIENCE 

  WILL BE INCREASED TO 30 DAYS UNDER JOBTRAIN , THE SPECIAL 

  INTERVENTION AND ACCREDITED TRAINING FOR YOUTH PROGRAMS . 

  8. 

  THIS WILL GIVE NESB JOBSEEKERS EXTENDED EXPERIENCE OF ENGLISH 

  LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS IN THE WORKPLACE AND BETTER ACQUAINT 

  THEM WlTH EMPLOYER NEEDS. 

  Interpreter and Translation Services 

  YOU HAVE ALSO IDENTIFIED A NEED TO IMPROVE THE PROVISION OF 

  INTERPRETER AND TRANSLATION SERVICES TO NESB JOBSEEKERS. 

  I AM PLEASED TO ADVISE THAT FROM 1 JANUARY 1996 MY DEPARTMENT 

  WlLL OPEN INTERPRETER SERVICES TO COMPETITIVE TENDERING. THIS WILL 

  SEE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INTERPRETER SERVICE PROVIDERS IN 

  THE COMMUNITY AND IMPROVE CLIENT ACCESS. 

  COALITION POLICY 

  THE GOVERNMENT HAS PLACED ITS COMMITMENT TO AUSTRALIA'S 

  JOB SEEKERS ON THE TABLE. 

  THIS COMMITMENT HAS PUT THE COALITION PARTIES UNDER ENORMOUS 

  PRESSURE. NATURALLY PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF 

  A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT -ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THEIR 

  WORKING NATION ASSISTANCE. 

  THIS CONCERN HAS BEEN HEIGHTENED BY THE BARRAGE OF NEGATIVITY 

  FROM COALITION SPOKESPEOPLE ABOUT WORKING NATION. 

  WE ARE CONSTANTLY HEARING THAT WORKING NATION'S PROGRAMS , SUCH 

  AS SKILLSHARE AND NEW WORK OPPORTUNITIES , "HAVE A VERY LOW 

  SUCCESS RATE" , THAT THE SPECIAL INTERVENTION PROGRAM IS, AND I 

  QUOTE , "A BIG WASTE OF MONEY" . 

  9. 

  INCREASINGLY THE COA LITION IS BEING PU T ON T H E SPOT BY CITIZENS 

  CONCERNE D A BO U T THIS RHETORIC AND ITS IMPLI CAT IONS FOR THE 

  PROGRAMS THAT ARE HELPING THEM . 

  AND WHEN THEY ARE PUT ON THE SPOT. WHAT IS THE RESPONSE? 

  APPEASEMENT. 

   " DAVID KEMP WAS PUT ON THE SPOT ONLY THIS WEEK ABOUT HIS 

  CRITICISMS OF SKILLSHARE. HIS RESPONSE? THEY WOULD RETAIN IT. "I 

  THINK THE SKILLSHARES ARE AN EFFECTIVE SCHEME" , HE SAID. 

   " PUT ON THE SPOT OVER HIS CRITICISM OF SPECIAL INTERVENTION AS A 

  WASTE OF MONEY , HE SAID THE NEWSPAPER IN QUESTION MISQUOTED 

  HIM- THAT HE WAS A SUPPORTER OF THE PROGRAM , PARTICULARLY THE 

  ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE AND LITERACY ELEMENTS . 

   " MICHAEL COBB, THE NATIONAL PARTY MEMBER FOR PARKES, HAS TRIED 

  TO EASE CONCERN IN HIS ELECTORATE BY SAYING "THE COALITION WILL 

  BE EXPANDING ON THE TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE 

  INCLUDING THE NEW WORK OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM " -THE VERY 

  PROGRAMS THEY SAY ARE NOT WORKING . 

   " AND JOHN HOWARD WAS PUT ON THE SPOT AT CRANBOURNE RECENTLY . 

  VISITING A SALVATION ARMY FURNITURE FACTORY FUNDED THROUGH 

  WORKING NATION HE WAS TOLD THE COALITION MUST MAINTAIN THE 

  WORKING NATION FUNDING. HIS RESPONSE? HE 'SUPPORTS ANY 

  INITIATIVE THAT GETS PEOPLE WORKING. ' 

  THESE COMMENTS WOULD LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE THAT THE COALITION 

  WILL SUPPORT AND MAINTAIN WORKINGNATIONINITIATIVES. THEIR 

  PROBLEM IS THAT THEY KNOW THERE IS STRONG COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR 

  10. 

  WO RKJ.\'G Nrl.TION-THEY KNOW THE ELECTORAL CONSEQUENCES OF SAY ING 

  THEY WOULD CUT IT. 

  BUT NO AMOUNT OF A PPEASEMENT , NO AM OUNT OF SOOTHING RHETORIC. 

  CAN HIDE THE REALITY . BEC AUSE THE FACT IS THAT WORKING NA TION 

  WOULD BE SLASHED UNDER A COALITION GOVERNMENT. 

  LISTEN TO PETER COSTELLO AND YOU WILL HEAR THE REAL COALITION 

  MESSAGE . 

  THIS WEEK THE SHADOW TREASURER, PETER COSTELLO , SAID THE 

  COALITION WOULD NOT BE RAISING TAXES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS CAN 

  BE BELIEVED IT HAS SOME INTERESTING IMPLICATIONS. BECAUSE IT MEANS , 

  AND HE SAID AS MUCH , BIG SPENDING CUTS. 

  BUT ONLY ONE AREA HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR CUTS SO FAR. 

  AND ASKED AT A PRESS CONFERENCE IN JUNE WHERE HE WOULD CUT, THE I 

  SHADOW TREASURER WAS UNEQUIVOCAL- WORKING NATION. 

  SO DON 'T TAKE THE SOOTHING RHETORIC AT FACE VALUE . THE COALITION 

  WILL SAY WHATEVER THEY THINK THE AUDIENCE WANTS TO HEAR. BUT 

  THE BRUTAL FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE COALITION WILL CUT WORKING 

  NATION 

  AND THE REALITY IS THAT ONLY THE LABOR GOVERNMENT HAS BACKED ITS 

  COMMITMENT TO AUSTRALIA'S JOBSEEKERS WITH ACTION AND WITH 

  RESOURCES . 

  II. 

  ~ 

  CONCLUSION 

  AS A GOVERNMENT WE DO NOT RESILE FROM OUR COMMITMENT TO GET 

  AUSTRALIANS BACK INTO WORK. BUT AS A GOVERNMENT WE CANNOT DO IT 

  ALONE. 

  MY CHALLENGE TO YOU TOD AY IS TO CONTINUE TO WORK W1TH US IN 

  PARTNERSHIP. YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ALSO BE INVOLVED IN 

  ENSURING GREATER OPPORTUNITY AND CHOICE IN EMPLOYMENT AND 

  TRAINING FOR MIGRANT AUSTRALIANS. I URGE YOU TO THINK CREATIVELY 

  AND SET YOURSEL YES GOALS. 

  IN THE 50TH YEAR OF THE POST WAR MIGRATION PROGRAM AND THE 20TH 

  YEAR OF THE RACIAL DISCRIMINATION ACT LET US WORK AND SUCCEED 

  TOGETHER. IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO OFFICIALLY OPEN THE 16TH 

  NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF FECCA. 

  THANK YOU.

  ALL THE STUDIES ON MIGRANT EXPERJENCE IN THE LABOUR MARKET SHOW 

  LACK OF ENGLISH AS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT BARRIER TO

  IMMEDIATE AND EXTENDED ACCESS TO A SUITE OF PROGRAMS , 

  INCLUDING LANGUAGE AND LITERACY PROGRAMS; 

   " NESB SPECIFIC JOB CLUBS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AND HAVE BEEN 

  VERY SUCCESSFUL WITH HALF OF .THE PARTICIPANTS IN A JOB OR

   " INTERPRETER AND TRANSLATION SERVICES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AT THE 

  CES; 

   " MIGRANT RESOURCE CENTRES AND ETHNO SPECIFIC GROUPS HAVE
