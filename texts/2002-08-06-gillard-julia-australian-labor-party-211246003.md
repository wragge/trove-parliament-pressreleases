 MEDIA RELEASE

 EXPOSED: HOWARD GOVERNMENT WANTS ASYLUM SEEKERS ON THE MAINLAND

 Labor’s assertion that the Howard Government’s plan to excise 3000 islands off our northern coast from Australia’s migration zone would simply drive people smugglers straight to the mainland has today been confirmed by two senior Government representatives.

 The Acting Secretary of the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Ed Killesteyn, told the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee the effect of this Bill will be to encourage people smugglers to head for the Australian coast:

 “It is a simple matter of geography that if you remove the outlying islands from the capacity of a smuggler to simply drop off their cargo, they’re forced to look for other routes.”

 Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty went even further, confirming that he would actually prefer to have people arrive onshore.

 "This is a far preferable way for us to go…..If they're going to commit a crime in the way that they're sending them to Australia, we at least try and get them to send them where there's some infrastructure support for them."

 These statements from senior bureaucrats show that aiming for the mainland is not just an effect of the Bill, it is its intent.

 The Government is effectively saying that the job of defending our borders is so difficult it will cop out and surrender them.  The Coalition doesn’t care about genuinely solving this issue - its only interest is in playing politics and looking for votes.

 Over the last three or four years, unauthorised boat arrivals have landed on Australia’s east coast in places such as Cairns, Townsville, Macksville near Kempsey in NSW and even as far south as Port Kembla.  If the Government proceeds with this fundamentally stupid and counter-productive legislation, it be simply laying out the welcome mat for similar landings to occur in future.

 In the national interest, Labor calls on the Government to withdraw this flawed Bill.
