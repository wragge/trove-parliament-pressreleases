  MEDIA RELEASE  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  ALEXANDER DOWNEB 

  AA 07 47 19 June 2007 

  Australia provides $4 million to support the displaced in the Sudan region 

  Australia will provide $4 million for emergency relief to internally displaced people and  refugees in Sudan, Chad and the Central Republic of Africa (CAR) through the International  Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). 

  Australia will provide assistance of $2 million for Sudan, $1 million for Chad and  $1 million for the CAR. Australia's contribution will assist the ICRC to distribute food and  improve water and health facilities provided to families and vulnerable groups displaced by  continuing conflict across Sudan, Chad and the CAR. 

  The people of Sudan, Chad and the CAR are suffering from the deliberate destruction of  livelihoods with millions of people reliant on humanitarian assistance to survive. 

  Our assistance recognises the links between the humanitarian crises in the three countries and  supports moves by the United Nations to adopt a more comprehensive regional response. The  funding through the ICRC will help its efforts to relieve the suffering of an estimated 500,000  people currently in camps across the region. 

  This contribution will bring Australia's assistance for Sudan and the two neighbouring  countries to more than $62 million since May 2004. 

  Australia will continue to monitor humanitarian conditions in Sudan, Chad and the CAR and  respond to priority needs in coordination with other donors.
