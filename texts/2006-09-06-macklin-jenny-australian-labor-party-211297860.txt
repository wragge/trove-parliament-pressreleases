 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVIEW - Parliament House, Canberra  06/09/06    

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:      Building TAFEs in Africa/Temporary foreign workers    

 Jenny Macklin: This morning we see another example of just how out of touch John  Howard is. His latest proposal is to build TAFEs in Africa. John Howard is ignoring his  number one training obligation and that is to make sure that there are enough TAFE  places, enough apprenticeships, for our young Australians. He has turned 300,000 young 

 Australians away from TAFE since he’s been Prime Minister and now he’s proposing to  build TAFEs in Africa. Let’s get this straight, his number one training obligation should  be to make sure there are enough training places, enough apprenticeships for our kids,  who want the chance to get a trade.   

 Journalist: But isn’t it fair enough that refugees that want to come into the country are  skills ready?   

 Jenny Macklin: Let’s make sure that John Howard looks to his number one training  obligation. His number one training obligation is to make sure that he addresses this  raging skills crisis that has happened while he has been Prime Minister because he has  not created enough TAFE places, enough training places, enough apprenticeship places  for our kids who want the chance to get the training here in Australia.   

 Journalist: Mr Howard has raised concerns about integration into Australia, is this one  way or a good way of tackling that?   

 Jenny Macklin: He is so hypocritical. John Howard is a complete hypocrite on this issue.  John Howard says that people should learn to speak English. What he is allowing is  people to come into Australia on temporary skilled migration visas who barely speak  enough English to actually be able to read safety instructions on work sites. John Howard  should get the message loud and clear. If he wants people to come into Australia as  skilled workers, they need to be able to do the jobs they are being brought here for safely 

 and at the moment that’s not happening. We have another serious example in Melbourne  this morning of a Chinese man being brought to Australia, when he gets here his wages  have been undercut, he has been used to undercut the wages of Australian workers and  when he complains he gets the sack. So what we have in this example and in the other  examples that we have been raising from Sydney is John Howard using this temporary  skilled migration visa to undercut the wages and working conditions of Australians.
