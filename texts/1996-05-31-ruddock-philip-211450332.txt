 REVIEW OF IMMIGRATION DECISION MAKING

 Submissions are now being sought for a review o f immigration decision-making, the Minister for  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock announced today.

 "As part o f our election commitments, we announced there would be a public review o f the  effectiveness and efficiency o f decision making in the immigration portfolio," M r Ruddock said.

 "The Review will especially examine the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review

 "My Department has begun seeking public submissions on this matter so that recommendations can be  developed on the most appropriate decision-making structures."

 "I am concerned about delays in the process, which can mean that some people remain in detention  for long periods, while they pursue all avenues of review and appeal."

 Written submissions are being sought from interested organisations and individuals. The closing date  for submissions is 5 July 1996.

 "I would expect the review to be completed by early August, so that I can examine the  recommendations and then begin considering changes to legislation, should that be required," Mr  Ruddock said.
