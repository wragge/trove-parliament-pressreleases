 The Hon. Scott Morrison MP  Minister for Immigration and Border Protection 

 

 Operation Sovereign Borders  Monday, 23 September 2013 

 Press Conference, Sydney 

 Joint Press Conference with Scott Morrison - Minister for Immigration and  Border Protection and Lieutenant General Angus Campbell - Commander of  Operation Sovereign Borders. 

 Scott Morrison: Welcome to the initial weekly briefing of Operation Sovereign  Borders. I am pleased to be joined by Lieutenant General Angus Campbell,  Commander of Operation Sovereign Borders joint agency taskforce established last  week on day one of the new government, and I take this opportunity, General, to  congratulate you on your promotion. 

 Operation Sovereign Borders is the government's response to stopping the flow of  illegal boat arrivals to Australia that commenced and occurred under the previous  government where more than 50 000 people arrived illegally by boat in Australia on  more than 800 such vessels, costing Australian taxpayers more than $9 billion and  sadly led to more than 1100 deaths at sea. 

 We'll be doing things differently as a new government. This is a border security  operation. This is a new and a genuine resolve based on the Coalition party's  longstanding commitment and belief in strong border protection policies. It will be a  tougher approach. Our resolve to implement what we have promised the Australian  people, to stop the boats, is absolute. 

 Those seeking to come on boats will not be getting what they have come for. They  will be met by a broad chain of measures end to end that are designed to deter, to  disrupt, to prevent their entry from Australia and certainly to ensure that they are not  settled in Australia. 

 Operation Sovereign Borders is the new government's action to stop the boats that  were started under the previous government. Operation Sovereign Borders is a  military-led border security operation supported by the direct involvement of a  number of agencies and departments brought together under single operational  command and a single ministerial responsibility. 

 The operation commander is Lieutenant General Angus Campbell supported by  Deputy Commander and former Deputy National Security Adviser, Alan McKinnon,  and there are three task group leaders. AFP Assistant Commissioner, Steve  Lancaster, is leading the disruption and deterrence task group. Border Protection  Command Commander, Rear Admiral David Johnston, is leading the group tasked 

 with detection, interception, and transfer. The Department of Immigration and Border  Protection's First Assistant Secretary, Ken Douglas, is leading the return, remove,  and resettle task group. 

 The joint agency taskforce will be headquartered in Canberra at Customs House and  the Commander will brief on its establishment following my remarks. The purpose of  this briefing is to provide an operational update on the establishment of Operation  Sovereign Borders, the work that has already been done and the work that is under  way. The government is determined to implement our policies to stop the boats and  our focus is on implementation. 

 This briefing is not about providing shipping news to people smuggler - it's about  what the government is doing in this operation to stop those people coming to  Australia on those boats and deliver on our mandate achieved at the recent election  to implement the policies that will stop the boats. This is an operational briefing of  matters that have been cleared for public release. Briefings will not be provided on  tactical and operational matters that may compromise current or future operations. 

 I would now like to run through a few actions to date that have already occurred in  terms of the implementation of Operation Sovereign Borders. Obviously, the  operation has been commissioned and the key principles involved in the leadership  of that operation have been established. We have also established a 48 hour target  turnaround for any persons who have arrived illegally by boat in Australia. 

 Under the previous government, people settled in on Christmas Island. That won't be  happening under a Coalition Government and will be moving immediately to ensure  we have a 48 hour target turnaround for those who have arrived, subject to  operational logistical matters. Secondly, we have taken the decision to expand  offshore processing at Manus Island by a further 1230 places and a further 2000  places in Nauru. 

 We have terminated the plan for a detention centre at Singleton and we have  transferred the funds, the $58 million, we're in the process of doing that now through  consultation with the Treasurer to have those funds available for offshore processing  facilities, as we advised in our policy before the election. 

 We have engaged in recent days with the governments of both Papua New Guinea  and Nauru. In particular, the Foreign Minister and I have had several discussions  with the Foreign Minister and Immigration Minister, Rimbink Pato, about our ability to  move to a much more rapid air transfer of people who have arrived to Manus Island  and that we greatly appreciate the support and the cooperation and the positive  approach taken by the government of Papua New Guinea in assisting us with those  new measures. 

 We have also at an operational level been engaging with the government of Nauru  and tomorrow I will be meeting with the Justice Minister, David Adeang, in Canberra  to further discuss matters in relation to Nauru. And, we also thank obviously the  Nauruan Government for their consistent support over a very long time, for their  willingness and cooperation to assist Australia in the way that it has and continues  to. 

 We have terminated - I should say we've engaged in the process of restoring  temporary protection visas. The reintroduction of temporary protection visas is under  way and the policy of providing permanent protection visas to people who have  arrived illegally by boat under the last government, that policy has ceased. We have  commenced planning and implementation of the regional deterrence framework and  other related measures including maritime arrangements. 

 We have terminated the onshore taxpayer-funded advertising in mainstream media  as practised by the previous government on their operations, including that which  was undertaken during the caretaker period. And we have established, as I'm sure  you're all well aware, a new communications protocol to support Operation  Sovereign Borders consistent with operations of this nature and as was flagged by  the Coalition before the last election. These new communication protocols are  designed to support the operations. 

 Before the last election, I made it clear that we would be reviewing that policy. That  policy has been reviewed with our new operational commanders for Operation  Sovereign Borders and we are returning to the practice of the Howard Government  when it comes to these matters and we'll be providing the information on operations  at these regular weekly briefings, which the Commander will take you through. 

 In terms of next steps, I've already mentioned the meeting with the Nauruan Justice  Minister, David Adeang. I will also be visiting Manus Island later this week. I'll be  heading up there over the back half of this week to deal with a series of issues, quite  serious issues, and will be working there and seeking to meet with the Governor of  Manus Island and other key individuals, as well as specifically visiting the centre and  delivering the message about the government's new policies directly to those  detained in those facilities. I will be making a further visit intended in the following  week, subject to the availability of key personnel, to Nauru. 

 We will also have to work through the funding issues regarding the ongoing  operations of offshore processing in both Nauru and Manus Island. The previous  government had not funded operations for offshore processing from 1 January next  year. This leaves a fairly significant hole that has to be filled and I'll be working with  the Treasurer and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to finalise  submissions to ensure the ongoing funding for those very important operations. 

 The capital funding for the expansion of facilities is drawn from the existing capital  allocations, but there is no operational funding for offshore processing beyond 1  January of next year, and we'll be moving to remedy that immediately through the  appropriate budget process. 

 So, with those remarks on an update of the [indistinct], I will now pass it to the  Commander to detail the other matters. 

 Angus Campbell: Thank you, Minister. 

 Operation Sovereign Borders commenced on Wednesday 18 September. As the  minister outlined, the operation is military-led and it is approached as a border  security operation, supported and assisted by a wide range of federal government 

 agencies. I've established my headquarters for the joint agency taskforce at the  Australian Customs and Border Protection Service building in Canberra. 

 The taskforce is comprised of three task groups, previously outlined by the minister.  Those groups will work together to ensure a whole-of-government effort to stop  people smuggling. I have about 50 staff coming together in that headquarters. Other  agencies will be contributing information, intelligence and expertise, as required, to  ensure that this is a fully implemented whole-of-government approach. 

 Having been appointed to this role only last Thursday, I'm now turning my mind to  the development of a campaign plan approach to a border security operation and the  associated regional deterrent framework. I expect to be able to update and advise  the minister soon on these issues. 

 I'll now provide an update on recent arrivals transferred to the custody of the  Department of Immigration and Border Protection. This update covers a reporting  period from the commencement of Operation Sovereign Borders on Wednesday 18  September to 23 September. 

 During that reporting period, one suspected illegal entry vessel arrived. This was  intercepted east of Christmas Island by a Royal Australian Naval patrol vessel  operating under the control of Border Protection Command on Sunday 22  September. It was carrying 31 passengers and two crew. All were transferred to  Australian government authorities on Christmas Island late yesterday, Sunday. The  majority of those on board will be transferred to a regional resettlement country  within 48 hours. The arrival of this vessel is in addition to the arrival of seven vessels  carrying 475 passengers and 16 crew intercepted or assisted by Border Protection  Command between 8 September and 21 September. 

 These seven vessels were the subject of media releases issued by the Australian  Customs and Border Protection Service during the caretaker period associated with  the recent federal election. 

 Currently, there are 798 people on Manus Island and 710 persons on Nauru. We  expect to transfer an additional 24 people to Manus and 34 to Nauru late tomorrow. 

 Since 8 September, two persons have voluntarily returned home from Nauru and an  additional two persons have voluntarily returned home to their country of origin from  Manus. 

 I will be providing weekly operational updates and would conclude by saying that this  is a complex border security operation, which I'm determined to ensure all the  agencies involved are focused on implementing and resolving. Thank you. 

 Scott Morrison: Questions through me. 

 Journalist: Was the 48-hour turnaround achieved or going to be achieved? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, the previous government had some constraints built into the  arrangement with Papua New Guinea, and through our discussions with Foreign 

 Minister and Immigration Minister Pato, we've been able to remove some of those  constraints. 

 If people are fit to get on a boat, they'll be quickly deemed fit to fly and issues relating  to health and other matters will be progressed increasingly at the other end. But  initial health checks, which enable that person's fitness to fly is the critical  assessment that needs to be made. 

 And the key message is this; you won't be settling in on Christmas Island if you come  on a boat. You will find yourself very quickly and rapidly transferred by air to one of  the offshore processing centres, if that is the outcome that has presented itself as a  result of your voyage. 

 Journalist: [Indistinct] are you currently hitting that 48 hour turnaround target  [indistinct]? 

 Scott Morrison: The first test of that obviously comes with this vessel that has just  arrived, because the decision to move to a 48-hour timeframe was taken late last  week after the government was sworn in. So the department has been tasked with  that target and it is my expectation and I know the General's that that timeframe will  be met and we'll have the opportunity to report on that at future briefings. 

 Journalist: You said to people on this latest boat that they would be transferred  within 48 hours [indistinct]. Who's staying and why are they staying. 

 Scott Morrison: There are a couple of individuals that for operational reasons I'm  not about to telecast what sort of issues might prevent someone from being  immediately transferred, but it is our intention that if they're not transferred within 48  hours, they will be transferred and we hope to resolve some of those matters over  the course of the next week or so as we meet with both PNG and the Nauruan  Governments. 

 Journalist: Minister, the media briefing [indistinct]; whose idea was it? Whose idea  is it? 

 Scott Morrison: I'll allow the Commander to respond to that. 

 Angus Campbell: Sure. While I have not, as a norm, and would not offer comment  as to advice I provide to government ministers of the day, a range of officials and I  have discussed this question and we are very appreciative of the opportunity to  provide regular periodic briefings to the media, the reason being that there is an  absolute respect for the need for the Australian people to be aware of what is  occurring. But, there's also a balance that is struck operationally to ensure the  protection of the conduct of current and anticipated activity operationally which might  otherwise message to people smugglers how we intend to conduct our business.  And so, for that reason, a periodic and appropriate routine to media briefings is  something I very much support. 

 Journalist: So, Minister, it's all the Lieutenant General's idea? 

 Scott Morrison: As I said before the last election, we would be consulting with the  operational commanders, and that's what we've done and the other agencies. This is  a serious military-led border security operation where we have Australians who are  putting themselves at risk. And it's important that we manage that information  sensibly and consistent with the needs of the operation. 

 This is not the same operation the previous government was running. The previous  government ran a shipping news service for people smugglers. That's not what this  government is going to do. This government is going to stop the shipping news by  ensuring that those boats aren't coming to report. That's our focus. That is our focus  and this is the reason why we've gone to this approach. 

 Australians will know how many boats have arrived and it's our intention that those  numbers will fall. And they will know about that and they will know when the boats  have stopped because those reports will demonstrate that. 

 Journalist: But how does that sit with your approach in Opposition when your office  quite regularly provided briefings about boat arrivals? You didn't seem that interested  in presenting good advertising for the smugglers at that point? 

 Scott Morrison: The government was not operating an operation such as this. The  government was running a welcoming service. They did not have the policies in  place as we've put them here now. It is the government that sets the framework as to  how information is to be dealt with. The government previously set those rules and  the opposition responded to the environment that the government set for  themselves. 

 Journalist: [Indistinct] smugglers [indistinct] at that time, but not now? 

 Scott Morrison: The government set the framework. They were the ones who  released that information, not the opposition. It was the government that did that.  And quite surprisingly, the government previously used to go to the detail of not just  saying when a boat had arrived, but they would actually give quite precise  positioning of the asset that had been deployed, and we're not about to give  smugglers a heads-up on these sorts of things, both by that instantaneous timing,  which many in this room who follow this issue closely will remember was not that  instantaneous on many, many occasions. 

 The other point I make today is that we will be making sure that the detention  statistics and bridging visa statistics will be updated regularly on a monthly basis.  The previous government had not updated the detention statistics on their website  since May and they hadn't updated the bridging visa statistics since June of last  year. 

 So, we will have a regular process for doing this. People will be able to go to it and  see it and these briefings will ensure that that's the case as well. 

 Journalist: What's the position with the government [indistinct] to children and  babies that end up on Christmas Island? Will they be sent on to Manus and Nauru,  or what's the position? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, Nauru is the place where families are processed and  transferred, that was the view of the Coalition when we were in opposition, the  government didn't share that view and they got themselves into quite a bit of trouble  on Manus Island over that. We don't intend to repeat the previous government's  mistakes. 

 Journalist: What operational objective is served by announcing arrivals weekly as  opposed to instantaneously? 

 Angus Campbell: What I seek to avoid in periodic and routine advice to the public  through the media is to prevent the potential for messaging to people smugglers with  regards to changes, to procedures or our tactical activities that might evolve over  time, or, indeed, to provide the broadcast message, if you like, that another vessel,  another successful vessel from my people smuggling venture has arrived in  Australia, which is quite false, but they are quite comfortable with lying to their  potential clientele. And in terms of then managing both the current and the evolving  operation, a periodic approach I think is a much stronger way to do business. 

 Scott Morrison: I note that, I'm sure media will continue to source information and  they'll report it. No one's suggesting that shouldn't be the case and I entirely expect  that to happen. But as you know, these matters were considered, it is, as many of  you know, not uncommon, whether it's in a law enforcement capacity or in an  operational capacity, that journalists may be able to cite various sources, but the  government, or the agency, at the time will make an official statement on what has  occurred. We're saying that will happen every week and that will provide the  confirmation of any reports one way or the other at that time.   

 We aren't going to allow the people smugglers to set the pattern and pace of how the  government responds to these matters. The government is taking control of our  borders, not the people smugglers. We're not going to hand that control to people  smugglers. We will ensure that our arrangements are the ones that we follow  deliberately, methodically and carefully. This will be a measured, paced approach to  this and it will result in success. 

 Journalist: Minister, are you hiding the boats, not stopping them? 

 Scott Morrison: The previous government started the boats and I don't think they  are in any position to lecture a new government on the issues of border protection  with over 50 000 arrivals on their watch. We're going to stop the boats. That's our  commitment to the Australian people. We couldn't have made it more clearly. The  briefings that we are providing here will ensure that people know the success of our  operations and the progress of implementation. 

 Journalist: Will they know when it's not successful? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, they will know how many boats are arriving, that's for sure,  and they will get that weekly and they'll get those numbers. But what they won't be  getting is the heads-up to people smugglers that the previous government used to  run. The Howard Government never operated that shipping news exercise for people  smugglers. The current government is not going to operate a shipping news service 

 for people smugglers. We're going to operate the operation, Operation Sovereign  Borders. 

 Journalist: With the quicker turnaround, are you still expecting health checks and  vaccinations, that sort of stuff that occurred previously? 

 Scott Morrison: Basic health checks are being put in place and the management of  those health issues on transfers is being, and has been, addressed in our  discussions between our officials and the PNG officials in particular, and those  issues are also being addressed with the Nauruan Government. 

 Journalist: Do you still expect to turn asylum seekers around at sea [indistinct] turn  them around and transfer them to Nauru or Manus Island at sea and, if so, when do  you expect to have that capacity [indistinct]? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, as I said at the outset, Paul, in this briefing we're not about to  get into operational discussions on things that may impact on current or future  operational roles. And so that is just simply not dialogue you can expect at this  briefing. 

 Journalist: But on that point, when it comes to turning the boat around, Lieutenant  Campbell, do you make the decision, is that your decision? 

 Angus Campbell: The conduct of operations is my space to decide, yes. 

 Journalist: So the moment when it's arrived where you need to turn a boat around,  that is your decision? 

 Angus Campbell: I'm looking at all forms of procedure and tactic and I'm not going  to go to any particular form, but, yes, in terms of the orchestration and conduct of  activity across Operation Sovereign Border, those are my decisions. 

 Journalist: Do you expect a phone call before that happens, Minister? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, there is a clear process of reporting that you would expect,  but the chain of command is respected by the government. 

 Journalist: Then you expect a phone call? 

 Scott Morrison: These are operational decisions for those who are operationally in  control of implementing the government's policies. The government's policies, I think,  are very clear and I note that the Chief of Navy the other day made the comment that  they are capable and ready to implement government policy, and that it is for those  agencies to implement that policy under the operational command of the Lieutenant  General as commander of the task force. So that's how it works. That's how it was  always going to work. These are decisions that politicians would only be involved in  where policy guidance is sought, and that's a matter for operational commanders. 

 Angus Campbell: Excuse me, could I just add one more point? I just want to  emphasise to you the captain of any vessel involved will ultimately be the decision-maker with regard to what is safe to execute. That's always the case. 

 Journalist: Clearly, that captain's not making that decision entirely by themselves? 

 Angus Campbell: No, no - you're quite right. 

 Scott Morrison: There is a chain of command. 

 Angus Campbell: The point's been made. 

 Scott Morrison: There is a chain of command and the chain of command is  respected. 

 Journalist: Well I'm trying to ascertain the chain of command. 

 Scott Morrison: Well it's a fairly straightforward thing, and people who are familiar  with the topic understand what the chain of command is and we're happy to give you  a separate briefing if you're not familiar with those protocols. Next question. 

 Journalist: [Indistinct question] 

 Scott Morrison: Well, again, that goes to operational matters that, whether they  affect current or future operational activity, you will not be getting commentary from  this podium or that podium, either way, on those matters. 

 Journalist: So we won't be told if and when [indistinct]? 

 Scott Morrison: Operational matters that put at risk current or prospective  operations will not be the subject of public commentary in these forums. 

 Journalist: How is that not hiding the process? We're not being told when a boat is  [indistinct], surely that is the key…? 

 Scott Morrison: You would expect me as minister to ensure the safety of our people  that are engaged in difficult and sensitive operations, I'm sure you would. And that's  what I will do. And the careful management of this information , as is the case with  any other serious operations, whether they be of a military or law enforcement  nature, you know are subject to those sorts of constraints, and those same  constraints will apply in relation to these operations. 

 Journalist: Will we ever know when a boat's turned around? 

 Scott Morrison: The operational arrangements - because we're going to get this  right, right from the start - because we're all going to be here every week when we  have these briefings, and we want to make it crystal clear - operational and tactical  issues that relate to current or prospective operations, whether it's the maritime  environment, whether it's in the land environment, offshore or anywhere else, will not  be the subject of public commentary from these podiums. We will tell you of what 

 vessels have arrived and have gone into the care of the Department of Immigration  and Border Protection. Those updates will be provided as well as transfers and other  key policy decisions and announcements and implementation issues regarding this  policy. But, we are not getting into the tactical discussion of things that happen at  sea. 

 Our joint operations with our good friends in Indonesia, and our other partners, are  matters that we will deal with directly with them, as with the other governments,  whether it's Nauru or PNG or Malaysia or Thailand or Sri Lanka or any of these other  countries. So, this is an open briefing process, but there are obvious limitations to  what can be discussed in these forums for the protection and safety of the people  who are doing our service for our nation in performing these tasks. 

 Journalist: [Indistinct] incident though, like if [indistinct]? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, what sort of incident are you referring to? 

 Journalist: If there's anyone who goes overboard or anything like that, or an  accident [indistinct]? 

 Scott Morrison: In between briefings, the Commander and I have discussed, if  there are significant incidents that occur, then obviously a decision will be taken at  that time as to what briefing will be provided. Now- 

 Journalist: -Who decides [indistinct]. 

 Scott Morrison: Let me finish this. So, under the previous government, where there  were significant incidents, Minister Clare at that time would often give a very factual  briefing of the events. And that is a practice of which we clearly didn't oppose and  that was a practice that we found helpful and obviously the helpfulness of that  practice will be considered in the decision that will be taken. 

 Journalist: Who decides [indistinct]. 

 Scott Morrison: You're looking at the minister responsible for Operation Sovereign  Borders and you're looking at the commander responsible for directing the activities  of Operation Sovereign Borders and those discussions and the decisions will be  taken between us. 

 Journalist: [Indistinct]. 

 Scott Morrison: I've just said that that decision will be taken in consultation between  the commander and myself. 

 Journalist: Could you brief us on a boat being turned back after [indistinct]. 

 Scott Morrison: I'm not getting into those issues one way or the other. 

 Journalist: [Indistinct] this was a key election promise. 

 Scott Morrison: What I said to you is that - and I outlined this in my opening  comments - that we're in the process of implementing and planning the  implementation of the regional deterrence framework measures and other related  measures including maritime operations. That's my statement on that today and  that's what I'll be saying today. 

 Journalist: [Indistinct] history of sabotaging engines out at sea et cetera. How  concerned are you for the safety of [indistinct] and these boats [indistinct]. 

 Scott Morrison: I am concerned with regard to the safety of our people in any  activities that they're undertaking and I would not focus in on any one in particular  but rather note that this is challenging and, on occasion, risky work that they do  magnificently, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and the Royal  Australian Navy, but it is risky. And their wellbeing is of great concern to me. 

 Journalist: [Indistinct]. 

 Scott Morrison: No, no. I'm simply saying that the conduct of these kinds of  operations, all kinds of border protection operations in a large ocean is always  challenging. It's hard work and we've got to take care of our people. 

 Journalist: [Indistinct]. 

 Scott Morrison: True. Well, obviously the offshore processing is my primary focus  at the moment and ensuring the stability and this is the commander's focus as well of  the operations of offshore processing on Manus Island. There have been some  considerable challenges to that and the capacity needs to be expanded significantly  and immediately and that's why we've made that announcement of the expansion of  that capacity and I'll answer the question for you. 

 So that is the first task, is to stabilise offshore processing on Manus Island and  ensure adequate capacity, not only for those who are processed there but that the  staffing accommodation as well, which is a critical element to running the offshore  processing capacity. I've got to say though that I'm quite disappointed that despite all  the grand statements about what was being achieved there, the capacity is below  what my expectations were and that's why we're moving quickly to remedy that. You  can imagine my great surprise when I learnt that the government hadn't even  bothered to fund offshore processing operations from 1 January and that needs to be  addressed. 

 The issues regarding resettlement will require obviously a lot of salvaging and we'll  continue the process of those discussions with the government of Papua New  Guinea but my first priority is to ensure we’re building sustainability in offshore  processing and that's what the [indistinct] working to. 

 Journalist: [Indistinct]. 

 Scott Morrison: Well, without sort of going into too much detail on this, I would say  that we would expect to have some of that capacity available on Manus within a  matter of weeks and then both on Nauru and Manus we will be able to [indistinct] a 

 range of different sites that are being used to do that. And, as we speak and over the  course of the weekend and these past few days, I have instructed the department to  put in place a sort of pre-tender process to ensure that we have the best possible  proposal and best value for money in terms of how we were dealing with the  expansion of capacity particularly on Nauru. That is a decision being taken by the  department and I was very keen to ensure that there was a process that ensured  that the appropriate tender was selected or multiple tenders for that matter to  perform that work. 

 Journalist: [Indistinct]. 

 Scott Morrison: Of course, Paul. That's why we're moving very, very quickly. 

 Journalist: Do you have confidence in Mr Stanhope adhering to government policy? 

 Scott Morrison: Well, you really should address that question to Mr Truss because  he reports to Minister Truss. Residents of Christmas Island I'm sure will make their  commentary. I've been to Christmas Island many times and I've always enjoyed their  company. They're Australians, like the rest of us, and they live in a fairly special part  of the country. The administrator is part of the government and I'm sure Mr Stanhope  would act in accordance with his responsibilities as a representative of the  government on any government policy. But his activity and his statements on these  things, they're a matter not for me but they're a matter for Mr Truss. 

 Journalist: [Indistinct]. 

 Scott Morrison: Well, you know, I've just outlined my response and that is the  response and it's up to Minister Truss and he sits on his responsibility not mine. But  all officials, as I've noticed, particularly since taking on this role just a few days ago,  the level of commitment, professionalism, whether it's from the Department of  Immigration and Border Protection, whether it's from the Australian Defence Force,  whether it's Customs and Border Protection Service officers, who also come  specifically under my remit as Minister, I have found a willingness and  professionalism to set about the job of getting the implementation in place and  putting in place the policies of the government of the day. And, I think that would be  the expectation of the Australian public having elected their government so strongly,  that the public service, as they are doing in my experience to date, are getting on  with that job. 

 Journalist: Have there been any discussions [indistinct]. 

 Scott Morrison: Sorry. All of our - well, I'd say this, that there'll be many, there'll be  much commentary that will happen up in Indonesia. Indonesia is a vibrant and strong  democracy. It's a great partner in Australia and a great friend of Australia. Our  discussions with the Indonesian Government will occur directly with the Indonesian  Government. They won't occur in the media. There will be no megaphone diplomacy  from Australia under this government and we will direct, will deal directly with them in  both communicating our policies and our intentions and with a no surprises focus  and working constructively with them and we look forward to that first visit with the  President at a time in the not too distant future. But others may make commentary. 

 I've noticed that a lot of that commentary is not based on an actual understanding of  policies of the government and that's to be expected when there's lot of speculation  flying around, and the speculation's been presented as fact and people are  responding to it as such. So, now, these briefings we intend to do in a fairly  workman-like way and that means keeping to I think a fairly reasonable timeframe.
