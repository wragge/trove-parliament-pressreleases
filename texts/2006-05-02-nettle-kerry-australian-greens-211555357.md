 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales 

 

 Asylum seekers must be properly protected 

 

 Senator Nettle, 2nd May 2006   

 Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle said today that revelations that Chinese  officials were allowed to interview asylum seekers, some of whom have since been  found to be genuine refugees contravenes the Refugee Convention and is of great  concern.    

 "Reports on ABC radio that the Australian government has an agreement that allowed  foreign officials access to asylum seekers is unacceptable and a clear breach of the  Refugee Convention," said Senator Nettle.    

 "Minister Vanstone should ensure all such agreements between the Department of  Immigration and foreign governments are made public for scrutiny by the parliament  and community.    

 "The Minister must also explain how this could have happened and ensure that it does  not happen in the future.    

 "Unfortunately this fits into a pattern of behaviour by this government.    

 "Under the secret Memorandum of Understanding with Iran, officials from the Islamic  Republic were allowed to visit Iranian asylum seekers in 2003.    

 "The West Timorese family being detained on Christmas Island told me that  Indonesian officials were allowed to photograph and question them against their will  in Darwin before their asylum claims were assessed and that DIMA tried to put them  on an Indonesian bound aircraft.    

 "Such practices and agreements demonstrate a willingness by the Australian  government to prioritise trade relationships with such countries ahead of our  international obligations to asylum seekers and commitment to human rights."
