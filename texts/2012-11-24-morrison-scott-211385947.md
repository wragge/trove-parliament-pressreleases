 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Ok, well thanks for coming along this morning.   

 Today, as I’m sure you know marks the fifth anniversary of the election of the current federal government.  It’s been five years of backflips and broken promises. It’s been five years of disappointments and dashed  hopes. Over the last five years this Government; it’s hurt you, it’s betrayed you, it’s wasted your money and  it’s compromised your future. It’s hurt you by making your cost of living pressures worse, in particular with  the carbon tax, which is driving up power prices and will do worse in the future, power prices which have  already gone up by 89 per cent under this Government. It’s betrayed you by introducing a carbon tax which  the Prime Minister said would never ever be introduced under the government she led. It’s wasted your  money on pink batts that caught fire, on overpriced school halls, on a National Broadband Network which is  going to be one of the all-time white elephants of our country’s history and it’s compromised our future by  losing control of the budget and losing control of our borders.    

 This Government will never ever deliver an honest budget surplus. This Government has already given us  the four biggest deficits in Australia’s history, on top of the four biggest surpluses which Peter Costello and  John Howard delivered in their last four years. This Government says that they are going to give us a micro-surplus this year, but if it happens, and I doubt it will, it will be on the back of cooking the books. They will  never, ever deliver an honest budget surplus - despite Treasurer Swan saying on no fewer than 150  occasions since May of 2010 that there would be a budget surplus in the current financial year, come hell or  high water.   

 This is a Government which has not only compromised its own principles, it has betrayed its own people  and the most obvious example of that was the political assassination of the elected Prime Minister Kevin  Rudd by the faceless men, with the current Prime Minister Julia Gillard, as the principal beneficiary.   

 But I want to reassure the Australian public, as they contemplate the disappointments and the dashed hopes  of the last five years, that there is a better way. We can have a better polity. We can have a more civil 

 2 

 

 Parliament. We can have a system where leaders are more respected than they are now. That the only way to  have a better polity is to get rid of the current Government.    

 I don’t claim that the Coalition is the answer to everyone’s prayers, but I do think that we can give a much  better government than the people have had over the last five years - and if you want to know what the next  Coalition government will look like, you can get some pretty good answers from what the last one looked  like - and for all the mistakes that the former government made, and no government is immune from making  mistakes, it was a government which gave us 2 million more jobs, it gave us a 20 per cent plus increase in  real wages, it gave us a doubling of Australians net wealth per head over its term. It gave us in short, a  golden era of prosperity.    

 Now, it managed to do this because it understood in the marrow of its bones that you can’t have a more  prosperous society, you can’t have a more cohesive country without building a stronger economy and that’s  what the Coalition will do. Should we win the next election we will build a stronger economy by getting  spending down, by getting taxes down, by getting productivity up. If we get productivity up then we will  have all the benefits that the Australian people are entitled to expect. We can have once more the hope,  reward and the opportunity that the Australian people are looking for.   

 I’m going to ask Scott to say a few words about legislation that the Coalition intends to introduce into the  Parliament next week, but before I do I just want to contrast, fundamentally contrast, the approach of the  Coalition and the current Government. Under the current Government the expectation is that people who  arrive illegally by boat will stay in Australia. Under the Coalition the expectation will always be that people  who arrive illegally by boat will go back to their home country. That is the fundamental difference. Under  the Government these bridging visas will be a bridge to permanent residency. Under the Coalition temporary  protection visas will only last until it is safe for people to go back to where they’ve come from because we  must keep control of our borders, we must deny the people smugglers a product to sell and the best way to  ensure that the people smugglers don’t have a product to sell is to deny them the ultimate prize of permanent  residency and Australian citizenship. Over to you Scott.   

 SCOTT MORRISON:   

 Thanks Tony. Five years ago there were only four people in immigration detention who’d arrived in  Australia by boat. Today that number in immigration detention, in community detention, in alternative  places detention and in the community on thousands of bridging visas, is well over 12,000. Five years ago  we were heading in the right direction. Five years ago we had secure borders. Five years ago we had policies  that worked. Five years later that’s no longer the case - over 30,000 people have arrived and people are now  arriving illegally on boats at the rate of more than 2,000 per month.    

 The Government needs to put back in the toolbox the policies that worked. One of the most important of  those policies that the Government needs to put back in the toolbox is temporary protection visas. Next week  I’ll be seeking to introduce a private members bill to restore temporary protection visas to the books, to  ensure that they are on the books and available to be used by this Government, to be provided to those who  are found to have raised Australia’s protection obligations.    

 Temporary protection visas, as Tony has said, are just that, they’re temporary; they’re not a permanent  bridge to permanent residence as the Government’s bridging visa proposal is. At the end of a term of a  temporary protection visa a person’s refugee status is reassessed and if it is found that they are no longer in  need of our protection then they can be returned home. In addition to that, if there remains an ongoing  protection obligation then a temporary protection visa is what is on offer. Under this legislation that we’ll be  seeking to bring this week, one of the forms of visa will also be dealing specifically with those who not only  come to Australia by boat, but come through countries on a way of forum shopping and country shopping to  Australia to seek a permanent residence in Australia.

 What our bill will do will ensure that if you have passed through a country, whether it is a United Nations  signatory country or a country in which the United Nations or some other agency is available to assess your  claim and you end up in Australia, then there will be a statutory lockout on a permanent visa for you under  one of those temporary protection visas.    

 Now, that is very similar to what was on the books under the Coalition government previously and we have  added to that, obviously, and in addition to that there will be the requirement for mandatory mutual  obligation requirements for people receiving benefits. So that is the temporary protection visa we’re seeking  to put back on the table. It is a key element of the toolbox which this Government removed and we want to  put back in that toolbox and I’d be calling on the Government to support that and at the same time renewing  our call from yesterday, that the Minister put into practice a mutual obligation requirement as a condition of  a visa, that the Government is providing for people to be living in the community currently. That can be  done this week. It can be done by regulation and I call on the Government to do that.    

 In conclusion, just in reflecting on five years of Labor, I remember, as a keen New South Welshmen, what it  was like when the Labor government, the Carr Government in New South Wales went into its third term.  When it went into its third term the things that are currently before ICAC, they’re the things that are now  rising as a stench out of that inquiry. I mean these are the things that are the end product of the culture of the  faceless men that we see in the Labor Party. These are the faceless men that feel they can remove Premiers  and Prime Ministers alike, and wherever they’re at work, this is where this ends and this is a culture I think  has no place in any government, and certainly not in a federal government and it’s I think something that the  people of Australia can have a direct say about at the next federal election, to say no to the faceless men and  say yes to a change of government.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Ok, do we have any questions?   

 QUESTION:   

 Yes, this morning in Nauru there was a meeting with refugees where they were told that the Government  would start entry interviews next year. They apparently walked out of this meeting and rejected it. They  were offered it through the Nauruan Government on behalf of the Australian Government. Now, these  interviews, they’re not proper interviews, they’re just a basic beginning interview. What do you think of that  and what do you think it could lead to?   

 SCOTT MORRISON:   

 I mean that is the start of a process and when someone arrives at Christmas Island for example, you have an  entry interview and people tell their story about why they happen to be where they are and how they got to  Australia, that’s a part of the process. I think one of the most important parts of offshore processing is to  understand that people are visaed in Nauru and you can have your assessment process and that will start and  that will finish, but then people will be visaed on Nauru and that’s exactly how it would operate under a  Coalition government. And so if people are trying to try it on, on Nauru and somehow try to intimidate the  process and make demands, well, I think the Government should stare it down. I know Tony and I would  certainly stare it down. I mean there will be a process - it should be the Government’s process - and people  who are seeking to be processed shouldn’t be directing these terms about how this should be conducted, that  should be done by the Australian Government.   

 QUESTION:   

 You don’t have the numbers in the Lower House, so isn’t this a stunt, this private members bill?

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 This is an attempt to offer people an alternative. This is an attempt to let the Australian public know that it  doesn’t have to be as bad as this, that while the current Government has completely lost control of our  borders, there is a better way and they would get a better way under the Coalition. Now, we have got  fundamentally to deny the people smugglers a product to sell and the best way to do that is to well and truly  establish the understanding that if you come to Australia illegally by boat, you can’t ever expect to get  permanent residency and that’s what these temporary protection visas are designed to ensure.   

 QUESTION:   

 Will the Coalition has a whole support this?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, as people know the Coalition is a broad church, but we are very strong on the need to stop the boats  by controlling our borders and that was what we got under the Howard Government, that’s what we are  attempting to show the Australian people is possible again today - even from the current Government if they  were prepared to put their heart into it and adopt these policies - but certainly that’s what the people of  Australia will get if we are elected at the next election, which by any standards can’t be more than 12  months away.   

 QUESTION:   

 Will you be pursuing the Prime Minister in Parliament next week on these 17 year old union claims?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I’m not sure that I accept the assumptions behind that question. These are serious matters and if they weren’t  serious matters you wouldn’t have people like, one of her former law partners going on 7.30 to talk about  what he seems to regard as breaches of trust, you wouldn’t have a Commissioner of Fair Work Australia  telling people that he still wants a royal commission into these things, you wouldn’t have no less a figure  than the Workplace Relations Minister saying that what was done by the Prime Minister back then was  inappropriate, unauthorised and out of bounds and I believe that Bill Kelty, the former ACTU Secretary has  said that he agrees with the way Bill Shorten has just described it. So, these are serious matters. They do go  to the professional integrity and the truthfulness of our Prime Minister and I think it’s perfectly appropriate  for people to put further questions to her on these subjects.   

 QUESTION:   

 The Treasurer has this morning said that it’s a pathetic attempt to discredit the Prime Minister and accused  the Opposition of having a smear campaign against her.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 As I said, these claims are coming from many sources. These questions are coming from many sources.  Now, when you’ve got Bill Shorten, no less a figure than Bill Shorten, saying that what was done by the  Prime Minister was inappropriate, unauthorised and out of line, when you’ve got Bill Kelty supporting what  Bill Shorten has said, obviously the Prime Minister has a problem. Now, as I’ve said repeatedly this week, I  am prepared to give her the benefit of the doubt, but in order to give her the benefit of the doubt, we’ve got  to hear her side of the story and so far all we’ve had over the last couple of months is increasingly shrill  stonewalling. Now, I think what we need from the Prime Minister is not just blanket denials but serious  candid explanations, given all of the new facts that have emerged, given the documentation that has 

 5 

 

 emerged, given the affidavits which are now coming forward, it’s important that the Prime Minister deal  carefully and candidly and openly with all of these matters.   

 QUESTION:   

 Well, having said that, how closely will you question her next week then?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, we’ve asked questions in the Parliament before, we will continue to ask questions in the Parliament,  but look, there are a lot of other things that we’ll be interested in doing in the Parliament next week, not least  the private members legislation that Scott Morrison has just announced. We think it’s very important to  tackle all of the fundamental problems that are currently bedevilling our country. We’ve got a budget that’s  out of control, we’ve got borders that are out of control, we’ve got a Government which fundamentally lacks  political integrity, so there’s a whole range of things as you can imagine that the Coalition will be dealing  with next week.   

 QUESTION:   

 What good things have they done over the last five years?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well look, as Anthony Albanese loves to tell people, the Government’s legislative programme goes forward  and you’ll be interested to know that something like 90 per cent of the legislation that goes through the  Parliament goes through without a division called by the Opposition. Now, I think this is a Government  which has badly let down the Australian people. When it comes to the big things, this is a Government  which has badly let the Australian people down. But there’s much routine business of government which is  taken place acceptably enough, it always does and it always will and I have some hope that one of the  significant things that might emerge next week is a bipartisan approach to trying to secure a successful  referendum to recognised indigenous people in the constitution.
