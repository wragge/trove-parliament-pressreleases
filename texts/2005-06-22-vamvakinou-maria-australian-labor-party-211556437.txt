 Press Release   

 Labor moves Amendment to 'Migration Act' to  help TPV holders   

 22 June 2005 

 Today in the House of Representatives, Maria Vamvakinou MP, the Federal  Member for Calwell moved an amendment, on behalf of the Labor Party, to  the Migration (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 in the hope of getting a  better deal for Temporary Protection VISA and Temporary Humanitarian VISA  holders.  

 In her speech to the House of Representatives Ms Vamvakinou pointed out  that:  

 “Those people who have been determined to be refugees should be granted  permanent protection rather than having to go through the traumatic and  pointless process of re-establishing their status.”  

 “The Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration have not understood the  folly of their in-humane policy, the Governments changes only tinker at the  edges, rather than address the problems at the core of the TPV system.” said  Ms Vamvakinou.  

 “We in the Labor Party understand that the handling of TPVs needs significant  attention, the proposed amendment will restore certainty and dignity to TPV  holders. Labor’s position is borne from our commitment to ensure that we deal  with this matter in a humane and decent way.” said Ms Vamvakinou.  

 “It is estimated that there are 113 TPV holders in the Calwell electorate, the  third largest TPV population in Victoria. The Al-amel TPV association have  been helping TPV holders in Calwell, the name of the association means  hope - and Labor’s amendment provided the only hope for TPV holders.  That’s why the Government should adopt this amendment as a matter of  urgency.” said Ms Vamvakinou.  

 The amendment sought to ensure that decisions on permanent  protection be determined within two years, in essence ending the  problem of rolling an asylum seeker from one temporary VISA to a  second temporary VISA. The amendment also sought to shift the onus  onto the Government to establish why a VISA should not be granted.  Unfortunately the Government voted to defeat the amendment, denying  certainty for TPV holders
