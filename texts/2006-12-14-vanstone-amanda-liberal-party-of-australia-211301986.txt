 November refugee and humanitarian arrivals to Australia 

 14 December 2006 

 Australia last month welcomed 1227 refugee and humanitarian entrants who were among those  most in need of resettlement, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Amanda  Vanstone said today. 

 The refugee and humanitarian entrants who arrived in November settled across Australia as  follows:  

 'Of these arrivals, 503 were refugees, many of whom have been waiting in refugee camps for  years,' Senator Vanstone said. 

 Refugees are people who are outside their country of nationality and are unable to return  because they fear persecution. These people have been determined to be refugees, usually by  the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and assessed to be in need of  resettlement.  

 The remaining 724 people were Special Humanitarian Programme (SHP) entrants. They were  forced to leave their home country after being subject to substantial discrimination. They also  have family or other links with Australia. 

 Included in the 1227 arrivals were 713 people from Africa, 367 people from the Middle East and  South West Asia, 131 people from South East Asia, eight people from North East Asia and eight  people from Eastern Europe. 

 Senator Vanstone said 22 family groups (a total of 76 people) within the November arrivals  were granted visas under a dedicated programme for women at risk. 

 'These are women and their dependents who have lost male family members and are therefore  particularly vulnerable,' Senator Vanstone said. 

 'All November arrivals entered Australia under the Government's refugee and humanitarian  programme that provides 13 000 places each year.

  'Australia is able to offer protection to so many people, in part, because of our commitment to  maintaining tough border security.'
