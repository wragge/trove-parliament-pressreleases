 TRANSCRIPT

 Doorstop Interview

 Hyatt Hotel, Melbourne

 2:15pm, 7 November 2001

 ATTORNEY: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.  I just want to say a few words about an event today associated with what the Prime Minister has been talking about in his speech to the 500 Club.

 Today there’s a meeting in Canberra of the critical infrastructure group.  This is a body set up under the chairmanship of the Attorney-General’s Department to advise the Commonwealth in relation to what is referred to as critical infrastructure, our national information infrastructure.  It deals with issues like the security of the banking and finance system, our telecommunications system, transport and in particular air traffic control and air ticketing, and energy and utilities like electricity.

 Now today for the first time in the course of a meeting of this group, there will be participation by people representing the private sector information infrastructure group.  And they will be briefed by ASIO today on some of the threats and vulnerabilities that they face in the course of operating their systems.

 This is a first and is really a very useful start to the preparation for the work of the Task Force that the Prime Minister announced at lunchtime today.  He’s proposing a Government-Business Task Force to examine the national information infrastructure with a view to ensuring that it is as secure as it can be.  And he has asked for that report from the taskforce to be delivered prior to the Leaders Forum that he is convening on transnational crime and terrorism early in the new year if the Coalition is re-elected to Government.

 JOURNALIST: [Inaudible]…specific genuine threats against Australia?

 ATTORNEY: The security authorities are not aware of any specific threat, terrorist threat that is, against Australia in relation to either

 terrorism as such or any of the other forms it might take - chemical, biological, radiological or even a threat of cybercrime. However, we must be vigilant, we must be cautious and we can’t imagine that it may never happen here because it’s a possibility that it may and we have to be prepared for it.

 JOURNALIST: [inaudible] … situation a month ago up in Christmas Island when the asylum seekers threw their children overboard.  Are you satisfied that that was the situation, that the children were thrown over by their parents.

 ATTORNEY: I have no comment to make on that.  You have to ask the Minister for Defence.

 JOURNALIST: Can you give us an example of the type of thing that ASIO will be saying to the private sector?

 ATTORNEY: Well, what they will be doing is explaining what are the possible threats.  In many cases the private sector representatives will be themselves aware of the nature of those threats.  But ASIO is in a position to offer intelligence-sourced information that will enable them to realise that there are real threats out there somewhere in the world.  Okay, thanks.

 JOURNALIST: Is the Government going to be … [inaudible] … that industries can take or are they going to be helping them with extra security? Or are they going to have to pay it themselves?

 ATTORNEY: Well, this is something that needs to be tackled on a partnership basis and we have up to now been engaged in the consultative process with industry.  We now are proposing that there be an education campaign to advise those parts of the business sector that are not as familiar as they should be with what the threats are and how to deal with them.  It’s an awareness-raising campaign that will start we hope from as soon as possible after today.

 JOURNALIST: So are we likely to see soldiers outside telecommunications stations?

 ATTORNEY: No.  It doesn’t work like that.  What we’re basically dealing with is threats to systems, information technology systems in particular.  Thankyou.
