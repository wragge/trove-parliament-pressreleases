 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 Greens welcome settlement for damaged refugee: call on Minister to  make public apology   

 3rd Mar 06   

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today welcomed the settlement of case of 11yr old  Shayan Badraie who was suing the Federal Government for damages for the trauma  he suffered whilst in immigration detention in Woomera and Villawood.   

 "Today's settlement represents an admission by the government that their policy of  mandatory detention psychologically damages those it detains," Senator Nettle said.   

 "It's time the Minister made a public apology to all the detainees who have been  scared by their time in detention and ended the policy of mandatory detention which  continues to damage asylum seekers.   

 "Whilst ever this government continues to build and operate desert and remote island  detention camps and refuses to deal with asylum claims humanely then tragedies like  this case will continue.   

 "The costs of the mandatory detention continue to mount both in human and financial  terms. There are hundreds of former detainees who may feel emboldened by this  result to pursue their own claims against the government.   

 "The Greens congratulate the Badraie family for their brave stand in taking this action  and hope that this win marks the beginning of a happy life for them in Australia.
