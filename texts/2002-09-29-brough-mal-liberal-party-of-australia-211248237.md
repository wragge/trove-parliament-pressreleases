 Work For The Dole Continues To Grow

 The Employment Services Minister, Mal Brough, today announced 504 new Work for the Dole projects nationally.

 This new round of Work for the Dole offers 7018 opportunities for unemployed job seekers to take part in a wide range of interesting work experience activities.

 'Work for the Dole offers two key benefits - worthwhile up-to-date work experience for unemployed people, which is what employers want, and a project outcome that benefits the participants’ local communities by way of new or upgraded services and facilities,' Mr Brough said.

 'Project sponsors tailor their activities to suit local needs - the needs of the participants and the needs of the local community. So Work for the Dole is a mutually beneficial scheme.'

 Project sponsors include a wide range of charitable and community groups, local government agencies and educational organisations.

 The new projects include:

 Developing and performing plays for schools and community groups in Townsville, Charters Towers, Ingham and Ayr. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Helping in refugee orientation and accommodation activities with the Migrant Resource Centre in Launceston. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Helping to merge two government agency filing systems and libraries at Geraldton. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Aged and disabled care work, including driving, shopping and meals on wheels, in Colac. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Creating a CD Rom from material in the SA Military Museum for public use. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Restoration work at the heritage Repertory Theatre in Broken Hill. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Painting houses and improving the environment at Galiwinku on Elcho Island, Northern Territory. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Refurbishing computers and supplying them to Canberra community groups. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 This month’s new projects bring the total number to 10,398 since Work for the Dole began in late-1997. The projects have provided places for 196,671 unemployed people.
