 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 

 Labor in crisis as 89 rejected asylum seekers take mystery flight to Sydney 

 Saturday 27th March 2010 

 The Rudd Government’s decision to transfer 89 rejected asylum seekers to the mainland in 

 Sydney tonight reveals a Government in crisis over its immigration and border protection 

 failures, according to Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison. 

 

 “The Rudd Government has become caught up in their own tangled web of failed policy, 

 flawed decisions and denial on immigration and border protection,” Mr Morrison said. 

 

 “Under the Coalition these people would already be on their way home. Under the Rudd 

 Government they're on their way to the mainland. No wonder boats are arriving at the 

 highest rate on record,” he said. 

 

 “The decision to transfer people whose claims have been rejected to await their appeals is a 

 radical departure even from the Government's own policy of the last few days. They are 

 making this up on the run and following it up with a backwash of spin, trying to pretend that 

 everything is under control. 

 

 “Labor are in total crisis now that Christmas Island is full and the boats keep on coming. 

 Their inability to face up to their failures and be upfront with the Australian people is further 

 evidenced by their late night mystery flight, designed to evade scrutiny and pretend it's all 

 just business as usual. 

 

 “These 89 people should never have left Christmas Island. The only reason they have left is 

 because Christmas Island is full. 

 

 “The Rudd Government’s decision to introduce merit reviews for failed asylum claims on 

 Christmas Island is now further complicating their Christmas Island crush, requiring the 

 Government to accommodate people for even longer after their claims have been rejected. 

 

 “The merit review process introduced by Labor provides more than these individuals would 

 have been entitled to under a UN process. Labor are now giving them a trip to the mainland 

 to further pursue their claims. 

 

 “There is no legal certainty about the status of these individuals once they set foot on the 

 mainland. When their merit review fails they may try it on in our courts. 

 

 “It only takes one judge in one court to hear the case of a rejected asylum seeker transferred 

 to the mainland. It all unravels from there,” Mr Morrison said.
