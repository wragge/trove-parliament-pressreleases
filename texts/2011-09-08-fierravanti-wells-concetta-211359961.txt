 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH   

 8 September 2011   

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH SENATOR CONCETTA   FIERRAVANTI-WELLS, SHADOW MINISTER FOR AGEING,  TUMBI UMBI, NEW SOUTH WALES   

 Subjects: Julia Gillard’s carbon tax; border protection; Craig Thomson.   

 E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It’s good to be here at the Mingara Club here on the Central Coast. It’s good to be with my friend and  colleague Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells the Shadow Minister for Aged Care. I’m pleased to have had  the opportunity to talk with some of the seniors of the district on the issues that are concerning them and  plainly this is an electorate which feels badly let down by the Gillard Government. Obviously there’s the  carbon tax which is going to make cost of living pressures worse but then there’s the fact that there’s really  been nothing done under this Government for the transport bottlenecks which so bedevil this area. I say to  the Prime Minister if she’s serious about helping electorates like this, Dobell and Robertson on the Central  Coast of New South Wales, she should drop the toxic tax.   

 I should also say that the Prime Minister has completely missed an opportunity to do something about  border protection while she was in New Zealand. We do need third country offshore processing. It’s clear  that the advice that the department is giving the Prime Minister is that we need offshore processing.  Presumably they’ve been giving her that advice for the last four years and you’ve got to wonder, given the  advice coming from the department, why the Government closed down the Pacific Solution in 2008 and why  it hasn’t restarted offshore processing a long, long time ago. I stand ready to help the Government put  beyond legal doubt offshore processing in countries like PNG and Nauru and it was until last week the  policy of the Government to have a detention centre on Manus Island. If they want to put that beyond legal  doubt the Coalition is only too ready to help. But I repeat, there was an opportunity to actually make  offshore processing happen which the Prime Minister has completely failed to take by not being prepared to  swallow her pride and actually talk about this to the President of Nauru who she’s been meeting with this  week.   

 Connie, you might just like to say a few words?   

 CONCETTA FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:   

 Thank you, Tony and it’s very good to be here at Mingara Recreation Centre. As patron senator for both  Dobell and Robertson, I’m spending quite a bit of time up here and one of the issues, as Tony said, is the  carbon tax and we’ve just heard from quite a number of seniors: their concerns about the carbon tax, their 

 2 

 

 concerns about ageing issues and a whole range of other things. The last time I was here at this club there  were over 1,000 people here who were very concerned about the Government’s intention in relation to poker  machines and that was certainly an issue. So, there are quite a number of issues in this area and of course the  key issue is who is representing the people of Dobell at this point in time.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Ok, do we have any questions?   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, you mentioned just then that Ms Gillard missed an opportunity to do something about border  protection in New Zealand, so what would you have done differently?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, the Coalition’s policy is very clear and it’s longstanding and it’s consistent. We think that you need  offshore processing in Nauru, we think you need temporary protection visas and we think that you need the  option of turning boats around where it’s safe to do so. We know that these policies work because they  worked in the past and I think that the Prime Minister has badly let Australia down by refusing to discuss the  detention centre at Nauru with the President of Nauru.   

 QUESTION:   

 What is exactly wrong with processing asylum seekers in Malaysia?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, no one likes the so-called Malaysian solution, no one likes the Malaysian people swap and I simply  point out that the Prime Minister was categorically on the record before the election that the Gillard  Government would never send boat people from Australia to a country that hadn’t signed the UN convention  on refugees. So, for the Prime Minister to now want to send people to Malaysia is a betrayal of her words in  the same way that her determination to introduce a carbon tax is a betrayal of her pre-election commitments.   

 QUESTION:   

 What were you told about offshore processing in the briefing yesterday?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, you know, it’s the Coalition that were the authors of offshore processing. I didn’t need to be told about  offshore processing because the Coalition invented offshore processing and it was good to find that the  departmental officials still believed in offshore processing and the pity is that the Government has not taken  that advice over the last four years.   

 QUESTION:   

 What about onshore processing?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, again, the officials obviously think that onshore processing just acts as a magnet for the boats. Now,  it’s a pity that the Government hasn’t taken that advice because let’s face it this Government has been in  power now for almost four years. One of the things they did early in their term was close down the offshore 

 3 

 

 processing centres. Presumably they were advised at all stages by the department that offshore processing  was necessary and they still haven’t got it going. It’s more than a year now since Prime Minister Gillard first  talked about reopening offshore processing centres and so far not a single boat person has been processed  offshore under this Government.   

 QUESTION:   

 Do you believe that onshore processing centres could lead to social unrest in Australia, or tension?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, it’s not what I believe in this instance it’s what the department thinks, it’s the advice that the  department has been giving the Government and the Government has signally failed to act upon it. I mean,  what was clear yesterday is that the official advice that the Government is getting has not been acted upon.  The department clearly believes that if you want to stop the boats you’ve got to have offshore processing  and yet this is a Government which closed down offshore processing and hasn’t been able to restart it.   

 QUESTION:   

 I understand immigration was talking about if there was onshore processing 600 asylum seekers would come  here per month. Should immigration explain these numbers?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, that specific figure certainly wasn’t part of the briefing. What was absolutely clear is that the official  advice the Government is getting is that we need offshore processing. Now, if that’s the advice the  Government’s been getting why did they close down offshore processing in 2008 and why haven’t they  restarted offshore processing a long, long time ago?   

 QUESTION:   

 Are you any closer to swaying the votes of the independents to support you on the major matters affecting  the Government?    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, that’s a question to put to the independents.   

 QUESTION:   

 Should the Opposition apologise to Craig Thomson after the overnight release of information from New  South Wales police?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I want to make it crystal clear that he hasn’t been cleared. All that’s happened is that the New South Wales  police have concluded that they’re not certain that they could mount a successful prosecution in New South  Wales to the criminal standard of proof. That’s all. There are still a lot of questions for Craig Thomson to  answer. Why was his credit card misused? Why were the union dues of lowly paid workers misused in this  way? There are still a lot of questions for the Prime Minister to answer. Why did the Labor Party make a  large gift or loan to the Member for Dobell? Why is she continuing to try to protect him from parliamentary  scrutiny? Why won’t she subject herself to parliamentary scrutiny on this matter? So, no one should think  that he’s been cleared and I think that the idea that it’s ok for union money to be misused in this way, any 

 4 

 

 suggestion that it’s ok for union money to be misused in this way would leave a very sour taste in the  mouths of the Australian public.   

 QUESTION:   

 So the Opposition is not going to stop pursuing Mr Thomson?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I think it’s very important for the Prime Minister to come clean. What does she think about the misuse of  union funds in this way? What does she think about the Labor Party bailing out people with these sorts of  difficulties? What role did she have, what knowledge did she have in the Labor Party’s gift or loan to Mr  Thomson to bail him out of difficulties arising from his failed defamation action?   

 QUESTION:   

 Are you aware that Simon Crean is on the Central Coast today plugging the carbon tax?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well I think that’s fantastic and I hope he gets an appropriate reception. But I hope he’s upfront about the  fact that the carbon tax is not only going to leave three million-plus Australian households worse off even  under the Government’s own figures; that the carbon tax will make the difficulties of Australian  manufacturing far, far worse.    

 This week in Brisbane I visited two manufacturing operations. These are manufacturing operations that used  to use all Australian products. They’re now having to source more and more of their raw materials from  offshore, from overseas and the problem with the carbon tax is that it’s going to make the price differential  between Australian raw material and overseas raw material even worse because the glass that the spectacle  manufacturers need is going to be cheaper from overseas compared to the Australian product because the  overseas product won’t have the carbon tax on it, the Australian product will.  The aluminium and the glass  that the window and door manufacturer uses is much more likely to be coming from overseas under the  carbon tax than without the carbon tax.   

 So, I hope if Simon Crean is on the Central Coast he’s going to be honest with the Australian public about  the damage that the carbon tax is going to do to their standard of living and to their employment prospects.   

 QUESTION:   

 Craig Thomson’s wife is heavily pregnant. Will you offer him a pair so that he can be at the birth of his  child?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, we’ve made it crystal clear that only in the most extraordinary circumstances will pairs be offered for  the carbon tax vote. This is by far the most important vote that the Australian parliament will take in the  current term of parliament and the first duty of members of parliament is to be in the parliament when  critical votes are taken.
