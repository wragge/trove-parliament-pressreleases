Australia will contribute $4.18 million in direct food aid and refugee
assistance for victims of conflict and drought in southern Sudan and the
Great Lakes region of central Africa.

 "The recent combined
effects of conflict, drought and floods have had tragic consequences for
people living in the region," said Mr Thomson.

 Following a
recent field visit to the region by an officer from AusAID, the Australian
Government' s international aid agency, it was decided to provide food aid
to victims of drought in Tanzania and to those affected by the conflict in
southern Sudan. As part of a program designed to increase self-reliance,
seeds will also be distributed to displaced Ugandans.

 In Rwanda
and Burundi, a total of $350 000 will be used to fund human rights
monitoring programs.

 "It is of paramount importance that
efforts focus on helping people recover from the effects of the devastating
war and these measures will assist in preventing any future outbreak of
hostilities," Mr Thomson said.

 Assistance is also being
provided to help local health workers contain outbreaks of typhus in
Burundi.

 Australia is also contributing $130 000 to the
Department of Humanitarian Affairs information network. The Integrated
Regional Information Network provides vital information on humanitarian
crises to government officers based in Canberra, Nairobi and Geneva and it
is critical it be maintained.

 Details of the way in which the
$4.18 million dollars is to be spent are outlines in the following
