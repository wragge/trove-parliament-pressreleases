 Senator Vicki Bourne Australian Democrats Spokesperson on Defence and Foreign Affairs 27th September 2001     MEDIA RELEASE 01/573

 DEMOCRATS CALL FOR MASSIVE INCREASE IN OVERSEAS AID The  Australian  Democrats  today  called  on  the  Government  to  undertake  a massive review of its commitments to foreign aid in the light of the impending humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.

 “We  welcome  the  announcement  of  $14  million  to  assist  the  efforts  of humanitarian  organisations  operating  in  South  West  Asia,”  said  Democrats Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Senator Vicki Bourne.

 “But sadly, it pales into insignificance when we think of the $100 million even a low-level Australian military commitment to Afghanistan is likely to cost, or the $100 million Australia spent on the Kosovar refugees.

 “But  it  is  not  just  in  South  West  Asia  that  needs  Australia’s  help.  The Government  must  realise  that  we  need  a  complete  reassessment  of  our overseas aid commitments.

 “It is well-known that the Taliban movement responsible for the horrific attacks on the US grew up in the misery of the refugee camps from the last Afghan war.

 “Eradicating poverty is not only compassionate, it is also smart security policy.

 “In its effort to win back the votes of One Nation, the Government has slashed budgets to its lowest level in 30 years at only .25% of GNP. This is a long way from the .7% the United Nations recommends.”

 “Now,  more  than  ever,  Australia  must  restore  our  nation’s  reputation  as  a generous donor of overseas aid,” Senator Bourne concluded.
