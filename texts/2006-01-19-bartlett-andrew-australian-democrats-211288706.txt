 Australian Democrats Press  Releases

 Dated: 19 January 2006  Press Release Number: upmvspgj  Portfolio: Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

 Papuan Asylum Seekers key test of DIMIAs Culture Change  The Democrats say the treatment of the claims of 43 asylum seekers from West Papua will be a  key test of the genuineness of the purported 'culture change' in the Immigration Department.    

 Australian Democrat's Deputy Leader, Andrew Bartlett said there is scant evidence that any real  change is forthcoming. With today's scheduled deportation of Mr Ali Beyazkilinc (who was deemed  medically unfit for deportation) only stopped by Federal Court intervention.    

 "And diplomatic sensitivities about our relationship with Indonesia should not impact on the  assessment of refugee claims."   

 "Evidence before Senate Committees last year, not least regarding the handling of the asylum  claim of Chinese diplomat Chen Yonglin, showed that the Department of Foreign Affairs has a  culture of disregard for human rights even worse than DIMIA," Senator Bartlett said.   

 "This must not be allowed to intrude on something as fundamental as an individual's claim for  protection from persecution."   

 "Australian Governments, in letting their own political interests get in the way allow a blind eye to  be turned to the persecution of West Papuans."   

 "Not only was Australia complicit in the enabling Indonesia to take over West Papua against the  will of the local people in the 1960s, but our Government also subsequently rejected many asylum  claims from people who subsequently fled clearly documented persecution by the Indonesians."   

 "Whilst the Indonesian Government has made remarkable progress in instituting democracy and  improving human rights, there is still ample evidence that the treatment of indigenous people in  West Papua remains a serious problem."   

 "Human rights and freedom from persecution should never be sacrificed to short-term political  expediency."   

 "The asylum claims of the latest arrivals cannot be pre-judged and must be assessed on their  merits, but the Democrats will be watching closely to ensure proper process is followed," Senator  Bartlett concluded.
