 Greens’ motion to condemn Malaysian asylum seeker deal  heads to lower house 

 A Greens’ motion to condemn the Gillard government’s plans to send 800 asylum seekers to Malaysia  has been sent to the House of Representatives, after being passed in the Senate with the support of the  Coalition. 

 The motion was first proposed by Greens’ Senator, Sarah Hanson-Young, and a notice to present it to  the House was given today by her colleague, Greens MP, Adam Bandt, the member for Melbourne.  

 “Now that the Senate has passed the motion condemning the human swap deal with Malaysia,  members of the lower house have their chance to demand the Gillard government immediately scrap  the proposal,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young said today. 

 “The Prime Minister consistently refuses to release any legal advice to justify the Malaysian solution,  so this motion will give the Parliament the opportunity for Australia’s elected representatives in the  house to say what they think,” she said. 

 “The Greens remain the only party to stand up for the fair and humane treatment of some of the  world’s most vulnerable people. 

 “Our position remains steadfast, while the major parties to try outdoing one another to show how they  can denigrate asylum seekers and flout our international obligations.” 

 

 The motion in the House of Representatives reads: 

 

 MEMBER FOR MELBOURNE: I give notice that on the next day of sitting I  shall move-That this House:   

 (a) condemns the Gillard Government's deal with Malaysia that would see  800 asylum seekers intercepted in Australian waters and sent to  Malaysia; and  (b) calls on the Government to immediately abandon this proposal.
