 Bill Weakening NT Land Rights Passes Senate

 The Australian Democrats are saddened by the passage through the Senate of the North Territory Land  Rights Bill saying that it marks a new low in Indigenous Affairs.   

 "Senators who chose to show their concern for human rights earlier this week, causing the withdrawal of  the pernicious asylum seeker laws, unfortunately failed to show the same concern for Indigenous  Australians," Senator Bartlett said.    

 "This Bill impacted on the human rights of our First Peoples, and to allow the passage of such legislation  without conceding even so much as a minor amendment in response to the concerns expressed by  Aboriginal people in the Territory is deeply distressing."   

 "Key parts of the Bill were drafted without the consultation or consent of some traditional owners."   

 "It is another example of the Government adopting 'new paternalism', giving themselves more power and  control, while taking it away from Indigenous people."   

 "The Government can't continue to put its agendas and desires onto others without finding out first if  these are the best and most appropriate options. Our society ignores the voices of Indigenous Australia  at it own peril," Senator Bartlett said.
