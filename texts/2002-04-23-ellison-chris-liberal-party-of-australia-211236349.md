 RESPONSE TO LATELINE PROGRAM AND CURTIN DETENTION CENTRE VIDEO

 Acting Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Chris Ellison defended the actions of staff at the Curtin Detention Centre.  Senator Ellison was responding to a video shown on the ABC’s Lateline Program on 22 April 2002.

 Senator Ellison said that the video did not show the full picture.

 “At the time of the incident I am advised that a medical team was attempting to reach the detainees shown in the video however the medical team were prevented from doing so by other detainees,” said Senator Ellison.

 Medical staff have confirmed that the detainee who appeared to collapse in the video did not require subsequent medical treatment, however all those with any injuries were subsequently attended to and none required hospitalisation.  They could all be appropriately be assisted at the medical clinic at the centre.

 Senator Ellison said that it can be seen on the video that one staff member retrieved a razor blade which helped avoid any further risk of injury to both detainees and staff.  He said it was standard practice for staff to wear protective gear when there was any risk of a detainee being armed with a potential weapon.

 At the time of the incident, the video camera and video cassette were stolen and the camera was subsequently destroyed.  The video cassette was not recovered by staff.

 Senator Ellison denied that the disturbance by the detainees had resulted in them being subsequently determined as refugees.

 “The Government will not be blackmailed by threats of self-harm or violence by detainees who are unable to achieve their ends through legal means” said Senator Ellison.

 The Government does not accept that the detention of people who enter our country unlawfully is in breach of our international obligations.  The UNHCR has acknowledged that it may be necessary to restrict the movement of asylum seekers in order to verify identity, conduct essential health, character and security checks, assess claims for protection and ensure that those found not to be refugees remain available for removal from Australia.

 The UNHCR has concluded that the policy did not, per se, breach the international covenant on civil and political rights (ICCPR).

 Detention of unauthorised arrivals is clearly prescribed in legislation and is subject to full parliamentary scrutiny and accountability.
