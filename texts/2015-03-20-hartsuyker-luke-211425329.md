 Vale Malcolm Fraser   

 

 Federal Member for Cowper, Luke Hartsuyker, extended his sincerest sympathies to the  family of the late Rt Hon Malcolm Fraser CH AC, the 22nd Prime Minister of Australia.   

 Mr Hartsuyker said that the nation had lost an experienced and insightful leader, who had  delivered to the Coalition the largest electoral win in Australian political history.    

 “Prime Minister Fraser made a significant contribution to Australia by restoring the nation to  sound economic management,” Mr Hartsuyker said.   

 Mr Fraser, who took office during the 1975 Constitutional crisis, had many outstanding  achievements as Prime Minister.  “His Government should be proud of their achievements,”  Mr Hartsuyker said. They:   

 â¢ Founded the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Australian Federal Police, the  Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) and the National Crimes Commission;  â¢ Created the Freedom of Information Act;  â¢ Gave indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory control of their 

 traditional lands;  â¢ Commenced the deregulation of the financial system;  â¢ Declared the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park;  â¢ Welcomed the resettlement of Vietnamese refugees;  â¢ Took a strong stance against apartheid in South Africa and Rhodesia; and  â¢ Protected Fraser Island from sand mining. 

 Mr Fraser subsequently served Australia at the United Nations and as a member of the  Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group. He also undertook work on behalf of several  charitable organisations, including as President of Care International in 1991.
