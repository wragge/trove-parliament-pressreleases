  International Year. of the Family.

 Australian Families In June 1992 there were 4,586,800 Australian families (ABS).

 AUSTRALIA

 1994

 Marital Status

 Marriage levels remain high, despite a 20 per cent decline since 1966. The major change in marriage patt erns is mar riage at later ages. More than 80 per cent of today's young people want to mar ry and expect their marriages to last.

 60 per cent of people over the age of 15 are married. Around three qua rters of these are first marriages.

 â¢ 85 per cent of Australian families are two parent families, just over half of which have dependent children.'

 Divorce rates have increased significantly since the mid 60's. Around 35 per cent of marriages in Australia currently end in divorce.

 Sole parent families represented 9 per cent of all Australian families in 1992, an increase from 7.5 per cent a decade ago. For almost 90 per cent of these families, women were the sole parent. The majority of sole parent families (more than 80 per cent) are formed following separation, divorce and widowhood.

 The Work Force

 The movement of women into the work force has been one of the most impo rtant social changes in recent years in Australia; from 35 per cent of married women in 1970 to 53 per cent in 1992. This movement has been pa rticularly strong since 1984, for mothers with dependent children in both two parent and sole parent families. A significant number of employed mothers work pa rt-time - 60 per cent of mothers in two parent families and more than 40 per cent of sole mothers are employed pa rt-time.

 In 1991, both pa rtners were employed in 53 per cent of two parent families with dependents, and 39 per cent of those without.

 Of those sole parent families with children under 15 years, 47 per cent of sole mothers and 69 per cen t . of sole fathers were employed.

 Childcare

 In November 1990, over one million families used childcare (preschools, day care, occasional care, family and f riends). The main reason given for using childcare was "work related", although families also use childcare for a range of other family related purposes.

 Ageing Population

 The issue of aged care is becoming increasingly relevant. In 1987 there were 1.7 million people aged 65 and over in Australia (10.7 per cent of the population). In 1991, there were 1.9 million people aged 65 or over (11.3 per cent of the population) and by 2011, the number is expected to be 2.9 million people (13.5 per cent of the population).

 37 per cent of people aged 65 and over who currently live in the communi ty need some form of help from others, and this help is usually provided by family members.
