 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP:  SYDNEY AIRPORT   

 15 MARCH 2007    

 Subject:  Sri Lankan asylum seekers, citizenship test     

 

 E& OE PROOF ONLY   

 BURKE:  Kevin Andrews has announced there’s now more of the same from the  government with their wasting money by sending people to Nauru.    

 At the moment there are 82 Sri Lankan asylum seekers on Christmas Island.  They’re on  Christmas Island for one reason and one reason only.  And that’s because it was the  Australian Government who took them there.   

 Over recent years, $396 million has been spent upgrading facilities on Christmas Island,  facilities that the government now can’t be bothered to use.  Instead, they’re going to  waste more money by transporting these individuals off to Nauru to have their claims  assessed there.   

 The government says that this somehow sends a tough message to people smugglers.     

 I want to make clear the history of Nauru.  The history of Nauru has been that people are  held there for a number of years.  Millions and millions of taxpayers’ money is wasted  while they’re being held there and they end up coming to Australia anyway.   

 If you look at what has happened to refugees who have been resettled from Nauru,  between Canada, Norway, Denmark and Sweden, a total of 39 people have been  resettled.  Yet more than 1000 have been resettled in Australia or New Zealand. And of  course when you’re resettled in New Zealand, you have a free right to travel to and from  Australia.    

 Nauru is a white elephant that is only there to save the pride of the Prime Minister.  It’s a  waste of money. The Sri Lankan asylum seekers are currently being held on Christmas  Island.  They’re there because the government took them there.  They should be 

 processed.  If they’re not genuine refugees, they should be sent back to Sri Lanka.  They  should not be sent to Nauru as merely another mechanism to save John Howard’s pride.  

 

 REPORTER:  Are you saying it is easier to get residency from Nauru?  Are you saying  it’s sort of a soft option?    

 BURKE:  It’s not that it’s any easier.  It’s simply that if they end up having valid claims,  it’s more than likely Australia will be where they end up.  The history has been simple.   When the rest of the world says they’ve reached your country, the attitude from the rest  of the world is that, having reached Australia, they’ve become Australia’s responsibility.    

 The Government has used Nauru as some sort of charade to try to pretend that these  individuals will never come here.  Those 1000 people who I just referred to that ended up  settling in Australia or New Zealand, they’re the ones about who John Howard said in  2001, and I quote: “I mean there’s no way that those people are going to be able to come  to Australia, which is what they wanted.”   

 Well, they’re now living here and they’re living here among us.  Nauru does not provide  anything other than a little bit of pride for John Howard to claim that the Pacific Solution  somehow continues to operate. There is no difference in outcomes - other than waste -  whether people are processed in Christmas Island or in Nauru.    

 REPORTER:  (Inaudible)   

 BURKE:  We’d process them on Christmas Island.  That’s where they are.  That’s where  millions of dollars have been spent actually building the processing centre.  They should  be processed there.    

 The Government’s actually done half the processing.  It just refuses to complete the job  because they’re still trying to justify a white elephant on Nauru.    

 REPORTER:  The human rights groups and the Greens have come out and said it’s cruel  to send them to Nauru.  What’s Labor’s policy on asylum seekers that come by boat?    

 BURKE:  We would process people on Christmas Island.  If they’ve reached the  Australian mainland then you look at where simply is the most practical place to conduct  that processing.  It may be on the mainland, it may be on Christmas Island.    

 But if they’ve actually reached Christmas Island or Ashmore Reef or any territory such as  that, the logical place to do that processing would be at Christmas Island.    

 Nauru and Manus Island are in other countries and Labor would shut them down.    

 REPORTER: (Inaudible)   

 BURKE:  This is the citizenship test you are referring to.  On the day John Howard and  Andrew Robb held their press conference back in December announcing that they had a 

 30 question test drawn randomly from 200 listed questions, Kevin Rudd asked me to  write to Andrew Robb to get a copy of the 200 questions.    

 We got a letter back some days later saying that they hadn’t designed a 30 question test  yet.  Not a single one of the 200 questions had been written.  Nor had they even  concluded the source document on which that test would be based.   

 There already is a citizenship test.  Exactly how different the new test is to the current  one is something we don’t know the answer to until we actually see it.     

 The concept of a test is something we already have.  Labor has no problems with that.   Whether the new test will be reasonable or unreasonable depends on what’s in it and so  far even the government doesn’t seem to know.   

 REPORTER: (Inaudible)   

 BURKE: We want to see just how different the new test is.  The current test has a high  degree of flexibility.  It’s conducted over the counter.  There may be ways that you could  formalise it and make it run slightly more smoothly.  Until we actually see the test 

 though, it’s difficult to give any conclusion to those questions.   

 REPORTER:  Are you saying it would be any easier, though, for the asylum seekers to  get to Australia if they were on Nauru rather than if they were held in Christmas Island?    

 BURKE:  No, I don’t necessarily think there’s any difference in outcome.   

 REPORTER:  You were saying before that the government pretends it’s tough on  refugees.  But most of them in Nauru end up in Australia.  What’s Labor’s stance, are you  tough on refugees too or are you more in line with human rights groups?   

 BURKE:  The key principle is to find out whether or not people’s claims are genuine.  If  they’re claims are genuine, then Australia as a responsible nation takes action to try to  find them a durable solution and to find it quickly.  More often than not, that involves a  solution within Australia in these circumstances.   

 The people you have to be tough on are in particular the people who don’t have valid  claims.    

 These claims, we’ve done half the processing on Christmas Island.  We should complete  it, and if the claims aren’t valid they should be sent back to Sri Lanka.       

 ENDS.
