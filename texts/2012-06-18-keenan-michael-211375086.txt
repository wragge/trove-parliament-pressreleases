 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling More Labor uncertainty as people smugglers  target Cocos Islands

 June 18, 2012

 In Question Time today the Acting Prime Minister, Wayne Swan, failed to rule out opening a detention centre on Cocos Keeling  Islands after a recent spate of illegal boat arrivals in the area, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection  Michael Keenan said.

 “This is not the first time Labor has claimed to have ‘no plans’ to open a detention centre. They lied about opening both the  Scherger detention centre and the expansion of the Curtin detention centre - so why should Australian voters believe them now?  “Mr Keenan said.

 “The Acting Prime Minister also refused to disclose how much tax payers’ money has been used to transfer these latest asylum  seekers from Cocos Islands to Christmas Island on chartered planes.

 “With four interceptions off Cocos Islands in less than a month, the people smugglers have made it clear that the Cocos Islands  are now their latest destination for boat arrivals.

 “The Cocos Keeling Islands relies on tourism as their main source of livelihood, yet according to some locals the latest influx of  boat arrivals is already impacting the industry -with some tourists cancelling their holidays to the idyllic island.

 “With no sign of these arrivals slowing under a Labor Government, the Cocos Islands community have every right to be concerned  about what the Gillard Government’s lack of border protection policies will mean for their future.

 “Given the recent spate of illegal boat arrivals targeting Cocos Keeling Islands, the Minister for Home Affairs must provide  answers to the following;

 ·         How many patrol vessels have been sent to the area and which area were they originally patrolling?

 ·         How many additional AFP and Customs officers have been deployed there?

 ·         Which areas these officers were redeployed from?

 ·         How long they will be stationed there?

 ·         What compensation has the Government provided the local owner of the Cocos Club whose business they have been using as a makeshift detention facility?

 “How many more millions of tax payer money is this Government going to waste before it reinstates the Coalition’s proven border  protection policies and put an end to the people smuggling trade?   

 “Only an election and a Coalition Government will put an end to this faÃ§ade and restore order and control to Australia’s borders,”  Mr Keenan said.
