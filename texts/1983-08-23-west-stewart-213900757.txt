 From the Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs. THE HON STEWART WEST, MP

 68/83

 EMBARGOED TUESDAY 23.8.83  8.00.PM

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Hon  Stewart West, stated that the 1983/84 Budget reflected the  Government’s continuing commitment to migrant needs and to  multiculturaiism. Mr West said that despite the tight  budgetary position which the Government, had inherited, high  priority had been given to migrant services.

 The overall budget for the Department of Immigration and .   Ethnic Affairs will increase from $139.3 million in 1982/83  to $158.8 million in 19^3/84, representing"an increase of  $19.5 million or 14 per cent.·

 Mr West highlighted the following initiatives:  -  ,

 TEACHER PERMANENCY IN THE ADULT MIGRANT EDUCATION PROGRAM

 An initial sum of $800 000 has been allocated for the provision  of funds to State and Northern Territory Governments to es­ tablish permanent teaching positions in the Adult Migrant  Education Program (AMEP). These funds will enable immediate  recruitment of full-time staff, and represent substantial  progress in the Government's commitment to improve service  conditions for teachers in the Adult Migrant Education Service.

 State and Northern Territory Governments which administer AMEP,  will be asked to initiate immediately the necessary recruitment  action for the appointment of permanent staff, and to give  special consideration to teachers with two or more years 

 service on a. full-time, casual or temporary basis.

 To achieve flexible staffing arrangements able to respond to  changes in demand for the Program arising from fluctuations  in the migrant intake, it will be necessary to maintain some  casual positions covering 35 per cent of teaching hours. .

 MATERIALS AND SYLLABUS DEVELOPMENT CENTRE .

 A Materials and Syllabus Development Centre for the Adult  Migrant Education Program will be established at an initial  cost  The Centre will work closely with the State Adult Migrant  Education Services, to assist in the development of the most  urgently needed program material.  The Centre will provide a  national focus to assist in getting maximum advantage from the  valuable materials and syllabus development work being done  by the State bodies. .  . .2/ 2 COURSES-IN-INDUSTRY English language learning arrangements for migrants in the  workplace will be improved and expanded with the provision of  an additional $200,000 in the 1983/84 financial year. The additional funds bring/the total provided in 1983/84 to  $1 million and will be used to increase the average number of  individual course hours from 4 2 ^to 60 and, thus, to maximise  their benefit to both migrants and'employers.  The Department  of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will also conduct a review  of current arrangements to ensure that the structure and  content of courses effectively meet the needs of migrants in  the workforce. CHILD CARE IN THE ADULT MIGRANT EDUCATION PROGRAM In accordance with the Labor Party pre-election policy state­ ment that migrant women responsible for the care of small  children should not be disadvantaged in attending English  classes provided under the Adult Migrant Education Program  (AMEP)  ,  the Government has set aside $5,50 000 in 1983/84 for  the provision of child care in association with the English  language program. ' It is envisaged that child care facilities will be made  available close to major Adult Migrant Education Centres;  and that existing Commonwealth child care and English classes  at migrant centres will be available to migrant women in the  surrounding community. Discussions will be held during 1983/84 with the Office of  Child Care and the Department of Finance to ensure that  resources are efficiently used. . . GRANTS-IN-AID The Government has decided to boost substantially the number  of Grants-in-Aid to community organisations employing social  welfare workers to assist migrants and refugees to a total  of 200, an increase of 60 grants over 1982/83. The cost of  this expansion is $1.6 million in a full year and $778 000 in  1983/84. It takes the annual value of this program, which  largely helps groups to help themselves, to $4.9 million. MIGRANT RESOURCE CENTRES Mr West pointed out that in addition to the $255 000 increase  in the base funding level for Migrant Resource Centres that  the Government provided on assuming office, a further increase  of $199 000 was provided in the Budget.  This means that the  centres will now receive $1 520 000 per annum representing  a 43 per cent increase over the totally inadequate level of  funding provided by the previous Government.  Mr West said  the centres play an invaluable role in facilitating the ' settlement of migrants. TRANSLATING AND INTERPRETING SERVICES ' In another initiative of great benefit in meeting migrant  settlement needs, the funds for interpreting and translating ...3/ '  - 3 -  services made available through cost-sharing arrangements  with State and Territorial Governments have been increased-  by $600,000 in 1983/84. This will enable new agreements to  be concluded, benefiting thousands of non-English speaking  migrants in obtaining interpreting assistance, particularly  in the courts and in the area of the law generally. The  amount provided by the Commpnwealth for these agreements will  reach $1 170 000 in 1983/84’. ETHNIC WORKERS IN WOMEN'S REFUGES , The Government will provide $200 000 in 1983/84 for the employ­ ment of ethnic workers in women's refuges. The workers will  provide assistance to migrant women in refuges because of  the particular language and cultural difficulties faced by '   women from non-English speaking backgrounds.  The $200 000 is  to be provided within the $4 -million allocated for the  Women's Emergency Services Program. OVERSEAS STUDENTS CHARGE -People enrolled in courses for study in 1984 will be liable for  the following annual charges: '  ' Masters degree and doctorate. $2 900 (previously $2 500) Courses in medicine, veterinary  science or dentistry $2 700 $2 350 All other courses $2 150 '  ’ ’  $1 850 Mr West said that the increases since .the charges were introduced  in 1980 were significantly less than education cost increases. The charges now represented only around 36% of the average  per student recurrent cost for higher education. The Overseas Student Charge raised $19.1 million in 198'2/83  and was expected to raise $29.2 million in 1983/84 partly  due to the increase in the rate ($4 million) and partly due  to an increase in the number of students liable for the ;  , charge ($6 million). On 5 July 1983 , the Ministers‘for^Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs, Foreign Affairs and Education and Youth Affairs  announced a major review of the Overseas Student Program. It is anticipated that one of the issues to be examined will  be the government's policy options concerning the Overseas  Students Charge. ' DEPARTMENTAL FEES AND CHARGES -  ' Other existing fees and charges have been kept at existing levels.  However, two new fees will be introduced relating to temporary  residents seeking to work. Whilst recognising the need for  some temporary residents to be given permission to work, the  Government is conscious of the need to ensure vigorous checks'  are conducted to keep the number of approved cases to the  minimum necessary level, as employers should give priority  to training Australian residents. A fee of $.12 5 will apply to sponsorships lodged in Australia  by firms seeking permission to bring someone to Australia  temporarily with permission to work. A fee of $50 will apply  to applications from people admitted temporarily without  permission to work who seek to engage in employment. 4 Exemptions will apply to cases of temporary residence under  four months and to other categories such as working holiday  makers (which are subject to other controls) and religious  trainees.  , .x ' .  The new .fees will apply from 1 November 1983 and are expected  to raise $1.9 million in a full year. ·  . REFUGEE AND SPECIAL HUMANITARIAN PROGRAM "  , The overall refugee and special humanitarian program has been  set at 20 000 places including 16 000 assisted passage cases.  The Budget provides a significant increase in funding for  assisted passages ($14.1 million compared to $11.4 million)  with the bulk of assistance being provided to refugees. Mr West pointed out that this increased level of funding  reflected the Government's deep commitment to humanitarian  programs. He stressed that it catered for the broadening  of the source of refugees, and the provision of assisted  passages to some people-suffering serious discrimination  who did not qualify for "refugee status. While the program will remain flexible, current'planning  envisages 10 000 funded places for Indochinese, 2 500 for  East Europeans, 750 Latin Americans, 1 750 other refugees, 1 000 special humanitarian, 2 000 unfunded places and.2 000  reserve. , Mr West stressed.that in addition to accepting refugees from  Indochina more Vietnamese would be settled through the  Orderly Departure Program direct (a program aimed at re­ uniting those with families already in Australia).
