 The Prime Minister, Hon. Peter O’Neill CMG MP, met with Australia’s Immigration Minster, Hon. Peter Dutton MP, in



 Port Moresby today specifically to discuss progress being made to close down the Manus Regional Processing



 Centre.



 



 Following the meeting, Prime Minister O’Neill said he was satisfied that officials from Papua New Guinea and



 Australia were making progress and further announcements will be made in due course.



 



 “Both Papua New Guinea and Australia are in agreement that the centre is to be closed,” PM O’Neill said.



 



 “A series of options are being advanced and implemented.



 



 “It is important that this process is not rushed but carried out in a careful manner.



 



 “This must take into account the interests of the people of Papua New Guinea and the wellbeing of asylum seekers



 and refugees.



 



 “The Supreme Court has delivered its ruling and our Government is complying with this decision.



 



 “I look forward to further updates as the process of closing the centre moves forward.”
