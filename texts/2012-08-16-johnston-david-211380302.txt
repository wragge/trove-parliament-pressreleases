 Remember our Navy personnel in this mess August 16, 2012

 In the Senate today Shadow Defence Minister David Johnston paid tribute to navy personnel on the Armidale class 

 patrol boats who have been at the frontline of Labor’s failed border protection policies in recent years.

 “They have been needlessly exposed to extreme danger and risk by this massive policy failure, probably the greatest 

 policy failure in the history of our country,” Senator Johnston said.

 “Many of them undertaking a nine day turnaround from home base Darwin, out to Christmas Island, then a number of 

 days patrolling picking up these boats….several members of the Armidale Class force element group regularly work 

 through their eight week on, four week off cycle, many of them work 12 weeks straight on the high seas doing nothing 

 more or less than operating a taxi service.”

 Senator Johnston also reminded the Senate about the ADF personnel who were involved in the SIEV 36 explosion in 

 April 2009 when asylum seekers deliberately sabotaged their boat then blew it up, with nine navy personnel onboard, 

 killing five Afghan men.

 “Its not enough to come here on one of these boats having paid for the privilege but when they get here they want to 

 blow the boat up, with Australian people onboard,” Senator Johnston said.

 “There were many heroic acts that morning in the process of saving the passengers and crew of SIEV 36 and also in 

 their treatment thereafter.” 

 “Australian navy lives were put at risk wilfully by this negligent and derelict government, that is what has happened 

 here, and I for one will not allow it to go without saying - but for the fact of the professionalism and the dedication of 

 these navy people who have had to endure this policy fiasco, there would have been many, many more deaths.”

 “Four years later here we are, the Government dragged kicking and screaming by Angus Houston to this solution, 

 that’s what this mess has come to - the events of 2009 should have woken them up…that the removal of the Pacific 

 solution was going to lead to disaster, to death and end in tears, and it has.”

 “I want to say to the navy men and women of the patrol boats out of Darwin, a huge thank you for their loyal 

 professionalism that they have continued to display, for year after year, dealing with this classic massive fiasco of 

 policy - their dedication to duty has been an example to all of us….they’re the people whose rights we’ve should 

 have been thinking about.”
