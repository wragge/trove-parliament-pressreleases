 SECURITY CHALLENGES IN THE SOUTH ASIAN  CRESENT - AFGHANISTAN, PAKISTAN AND IRAQ   

 Speech to the Kokoda Foundation   

 Senator John Faulkner, Minister for Defence 19 November  2009   

 

 Check against delivery   

 Ladies and gentlemen, of all the responsibilities of a national 

 government, none are greater than that the nation be safe, and 

 the community feel safe. 

 

 Force of arms alone cannot discharge this responsibility. We 

 must confront and confound a far more varied range of threats, 

 and balance a far more complex range of priorities, than purely 

 military ones.  

 

 Our world has changed, and is continuing to change at an ever 

 more rapid rate.  Traditional distinctions between foreign and 

 domestic, national and international have been blurred by the 

 increasing complexity and increasing interconnectedness of a 

 world where populations are more mobile than ever in history. 

 Individuals can cross the world in a day. Ideas can do so in a 

 second.  

 

 Military conflict between nation states is no longer the only, or 

 even the greatest, ‘security challenge’ we face.  And the 

 expectation of victory in a conventional war is no longer 

 sufficient to give our citizens confidence in their safety or the 

 safety of the nation’s interests and assets.  

 

 In a world both ‘shrunk’ by technology and warmed by climate 

 change, we must respond to, indeed we must anticipate and try 

 to prevent, the threats posed not only by rogue states or terrorist 

 groups, but by more severe and more frequent extreme weather 

 events, pandemic disease, resource shortages, large numbers of 

 people forced from their homes by violence or disaster, 

 cybercrime and cyber terrorism. 

 

 These are global problems.  

 

 Problems that have global causes - like climate change.  

 

 Problems that have global reach - like failed states becoming 

 training grounds and staging posts for terrorist organisations.  

 

 They are not problems any nation can find security from in 

 isolation.  

 They are not problems any one nation can address alone.  

 

 Our economies, our climate, our safety, and our citizens are 

 connected to each other in so many complex ways that 

 insecurity and instability in one region, failures of governance in 

 one nation, recklessness or indifference on the part of one 

 government, can affect us all. 

 

 No national government, working to safeguard national 

 security, can afford to be short-sighted about international 

 security. 

 

 And as we all must look beyond our borders to anticipate, 

 prevent and respond to security challenges, we must also 

 recognise that in a world of multi-dimensional dangers on a 

 global scale, no response can be effective if pursued in isolation 

 from friends and allies. The security of any nation and the safety 

 of all our citizens now must depend on intelligence and 

 diplomacy, on military power and moral suasion, on 

 international co-operation and multinational coalitions. 

 

 But even the most prosperous and powerful nations face choices 

 about finite resources. Even the most prosperous and powerful 

 nations must set priorities.   

 

 As Minister for Defence, I have the responsibility to make sure 

 the Australian Defence Organisation and the Australian Defence 

 Force has what it needs to undertake the tasks the government 

 and the community expect from them.  

 

 In the 2009 Defence White Paper the government has made it 

 clear that while the principal task for the ADF is to deter and 

 defeat armed attacks on Australia, the ADF must also be ready 

 and able to contribute to stability and security in the South 

 Pacific and East Timor, to military contingencies in the Asia-Pacific region and more broadly, in support of efforts by the 

 international community to uphold global security and a rules-based international order. 

 

 Our military commitment to the International Security 

 Assistance Force in Afghanistan is consistent with these aims.  

 

 Australia, the United States, and 41 other partners from the 

 international community are in Afghanistan, as a NATO mission 

 with a UN mandate, to assist the Afghan people in making sure 

 Afghanistan does not again become an operating base and a 

 training ground for terrorists, as it was under the Taliban 

 dictatorship.   

 

 Ladies and gentlemen, the last few months have been difficult 

 for the people of Afghanistan and the ISAF partners.  

 

 As General McChrystal has noted, ‘the situation in Afghanistan 

 is serious; neither success nor failure can be taken for granted’.  

 

 There are real concerns that the insurgency is growing, that our 

 momentum is slowing, and that the Taliban are gaining the 

 upper hand.  

 

 The people of Afghanistan have endured decades of civil 

 conflict.  In a country where life expectancy is forty four, the 

 majority of the population has been born and raised in a climate 

 of fear.  Coming from a western democracy, this is hard to 

 comprehend.    

 

 Without confidence in the commitment of the international 

 coalition to counter the Taliban, they have a very real fear that 

 the Taliban will once again take control in local communities 

 and that retribution will follow.  

 

 We must give them that confidence.  

 

 But they must have confidence not only in us. They need 

 confidence in their own institutions of government and in their 

 own security forces. 

 

 The international military presence cannot be a permanent one.  

 And that is not just a consequence of the military capacity and 

 priorities of the countries participating in ISAF.  It is also, quite 

 simply, the right of the Afghan people themselves to be 

 responsible for security, stability and governance in their own 

 land.   

 

 A key challenge in Afghanistan is building the capacity of the 

 Afghan government so that transfer of responsibility can 

 happen. 

 

 This cannot happen without a credible Afghan Government that 

 is able to unify the Afghan people and win their trust.    

 

 On this day of the inauguration of President Karzai, the 

 Australian Government, along with many countries around the 

 world, now expects the Karzai Administration to provide a 

 credible and viable Government. 

 

 Ladies and gentlemen, let me be frank.  The new government 

 will need to make substantive and early progress, particularly in 

 fighting corruption and narco-trafficking, improving 

 governance, strengthening Afghan security forces and delivering 

 basic services. 

 

 These challenges are immense.  

 

 They will not be easily or quickly solved, but they must be 

 confronted without delay.  

 

 The first major task is to counter corruption.  Afghanistan has 

 been found to be the second most corrupt country in the world 

 by Transparency International.  

 

 It is imperative that President Karzai follow through on his 

 commitment to crack down on corruption. It is only when solid 

 progress has been made that the process of regaining the 

 confidence and trust of the Afghan people and the international 

 community will begin.  

 

 I hope the recent commitment by the Afghan Government to set 

 up anti-corruption mechanisms will begin the process of 

 regaining confidence and trust.  

 

 Ladies and gentlemen, it is now obviously a priority for the US 

 and NATO to determine the way forward in response to General 

 McChrystal’s Assessment. 

 

 President Obama is expected to announce the US response in the 

 coming weeks.  NATO is also focusing on how it can contribute 

 to the revised strategy.  NATO Secretary General Rasmussen 

 has indicated that he is expecting a substantial commitment from 

 NATO for more forces in Afghanistan.  

 

 But we must also remember, ladies and gentlemen, that 

 Afghanistan’s problems cannot be solved through military 

 means alone.  The civilian effort is critical as well.  

 

 The recent and tragic attack on the UN residence in Kabul was a 

 reminder of the dangers facing the many civilians working in 

 Afghanistan to help bring security and stability to the country, 

 build the institutions of governance and the infrastructure of 

 civil life.   

 

 We welcome the pledge by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon 

 that the attack will not deter the UN from its mission to help the 

 Afghan people build a better future.  The coordination of 

 civilian and military efforts in Afghanistan is critical if progress 

 is going to be made. 

 

 Ladies and gentlemen, Afghanistan remains a critically 

 important priority for our Government. 

 

 We have recently increased Australia’s commitment and troop 

 levels in Afghanistan by 40 per cent; an increase that is very 

 much focused on the training and development of the Afghan 

 National Army 4th Brigade in Oruzgan Province. 

 

 Australia  has  committed  around  1550  troops.  This  includes  a  

 Mentoring  and  Reconstruction  Task  Force  and  the  Special  

 Operations Task Group. 

 

 The  Special  Operations  Task  Group  (SOTG)  is  currently  

 deployed  to  Oruzgan,  conducting  operations  against  Taliban  

 insurgents.   The  Task  Group  works  with  the  Dutch  led  Task-Force  Oruzgan  and  helps  provide  a  level  of  enhanced  force  

 protection to MRTF activities in the province.  

 

 We saw their work pay off just two weeks ago with a complex 

 and  highly  successful  operation  against  a  known  insurgent  

 stronghold  responsible  for  distributing  Taliban  arms,  

 ammunition,  equipment  and  fighters  across  Oruzgan.   The  

 operation is expected to have a direct and significant impact on 

 the  security  of  the  civilian  population,  of  the  Afghan  National  

 Security  Forces,  as  well  as  the  coalition  forces  across  southern  

 Afghanistan.    

 

 

 The  MRTF  is  focused  on  developing  the  capability  of  the  4th  

 Brigade to the point where it can take over responsibility for the 

 security of the province. We are committed to that task, and we 

 believe  that  our  commitment  is  appropriate,  effective,  and  at  

 about the right level.  

 

 I took advantage of recent ministerial meetings at NATO in 

 Bratislava to discuss the work in Oruzgan with my Dutch 

 counterpart, Defence Minister Middelkoop.   

 

 I took the opportunity, as I do now, to acknowledge our Dutch 

 partners in Oruzgan Province - their leadership, their efforts, 

 have delivered lasting improvements and real progress.  It goes 

 without saying that Australia’s own efforts have been heavily 

 dependent on the very valuable support provided by our Dutch 

 partners. The Dutch bring much to the mission, including an 

 extensive understanding of the tribal and local governance 

 dynamics of the region. The knowledge and skills they bring to 

 our joint efforts would be difficult to replace. 

 

 As you know, the Dutch commitment to the lead role they play 

 in Oruzgan extends only to August next year.  A final decision 

 on what, if any, commitment they intend to maintain after that 

 time is yet to be made.  

 

 Australia would prefer to see the Dutch continue to work side by 

 side with us in Oruzgan, a point I made strongly in Bratislava. 

 Prime Minister Rudd also recently expressed similar views to 

 his Dutch counterpart. 

 

 The decision about the Dutch contingent is, of course, in the end 

 a matter for the Netherlands Government. 

 

 If the Dutch contingent - or elements of it - do withdraw, their 

 replacement will be a matter for decision by NATO. I continue 

 to urge my NATO and US counterparts to deal with this issue as 

 a matter of urgency.  

 

 Ladies and gentlemen, earlier this month I made my first official 

 visit to Washington as Defence Minister.  I had very positive 

 meetings with the Secretary for Defense, Bob Gates, with the 

 National Security Adviser General Jim Jones, and with Senator 

 John McCain, General Petraeus, and Senator Carl Levin, the 

 chairman of the Armed Services Committee, among others.  

 

 While I do not intend to canvass the detail of those discussions, I 

 can say that the major focus of these meetings was the situation 

 in Afghanistan, including the implications of General 

 McChrystal's Assessment and the US review of strategy, as well 

 as the training of the Afghan National Army and the 

 consequences of any possible Dutch drawdown of its 

 commitment.  

 

 Ladies and gentlemen, the ISAF troops in Afghanistan are doing 

 a difficult, a dangerous, sometimes a deadly job. But it is vital. 

 

 The  return  of  the  Taliban  to  power  in  Afghanistan  would  have  

 the  most  serious  implications  for  the  fight  against  organised  

 terrorism and the global criminal networks that fund and support 

 terrorist organisations.  

 

 But the consequences go further. 

 

 Ladies  and  gentlemen,  during  the  troubled  years  of  

 Afghanistan’s  history  prior  to  the  overthrow  of  the  Taliban,  

 Afghan  refugees  were  the  largest  refugee  population  in  the  

 world.  At its peak, around seven and a half million had sought 

 refuge in Afghanistan’s neighbours, Pakistan and Iran.  

 

 

 

 Since  2002,  significant  numbers  have  returned  to  Afghanistan.   

 However, of the tens of millions of displaced people worldwide 

 today,  nearly  2  million  are  Afghan  refugees  in  Pakistan  and  

 around a million are Afghan refugees in Iran. 

 

 Mass  movements  of  populations  are  a  problem  for  many  

 countries, but few have been confronted with such an immense 

 challenge  as  Pakistan.  There,  the  problem  is  compounded  by  

 large  numbers  of  Pakistan’s  own  citizens,  internally  displaced  

 by recent conflict.  

 

 There is no doubt misery and insecurity make people more 

 vulnerable to radicalisation.  

 

 In the struggle against terrorist networks, the denial of safe-havens is crucial - and not only in the South Asian Crescent.  

 Countries where governance is weak are less able to disrupt 

 terrorist organisations and activities within their borders.  This 

 has consequences for the international community as a whole.  

 

 And good governance can only flourish in a secure environment. 

 This is an ongoing problem in Pakistan, as well as Afghanistan.  

 

 We have seen, in recent months, a string of very serious attacks 

 in Pakistan, attacks that are clearly meant to intimidate the 

 government and the people of Pakistan, who reject the agenda of 

 these extremists, and to disrupt operations against Taliban 

 insurgents as well as international aid efforts.   

 

 While historically, Pakistan has seen its national security very 

 much through the lens of its relations with India, recent events, 

 especially the Taliban attacks in Buner, a province just 100 

 kilometres from Islamabad, have made it clear that the extremist 

 threats that have originated in the Federally Administered Tribal 

 Areas are a threat to Pakistan’s very existence.   

 

 Australia, and the rest of the world, is paying very close 

 attention to the current Pakistan Army operations.  Such action 

 is critical to our efforts to deal with extremists in Afghanistan.  

 

 Cross-border extremist networks have helped fuel the 

 insurgency in Afghanistan, and they take an increasingly heavy 

 toll on the people of Pakistan, as we are reminded with every 

 new report of a suicide bombing.  And they also threaten 

 broader stability in the South Asian region - think of the 

 terrorist attacks in Mumbai.  

 

 We are under no illusions as to the difficulty the Pakistan 

 Government faces in disabling these networks and disrupting 

 their activities.   

 

 In recognition of the importance of the struggle against the 

 extremist insurgency in Pakistan, Australia is increasing defence 

 training to 140 places making us Pakistan’s second largest 

 overseas trainer, and a significant provider of expertise on 

 counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency.  We are also 

 establishing defence post graduate scholarships. 

 

 This will complement the large aid and military assistance 

 packages being provided by the United States, which will help 

 assist development in that country.  

 

 Ladies and gentlemen, in line with the need for 

 multidimensional approaches to multidimensional problems, 

 Australia also plans to establish a new Australia-Pakistan 

 Development partnership, focusing on health reform, 

 reconstruction of the Malakand region, democratic governance 

 and economic reform, as well as providing 100 agricultural 

 scholarships.  We will also invigorate the Australia-Pakistan 

 Joint Trade Committee, underlining our commitment to assist on 

 security, economic and social fronts, and we are doubling 

 development assistance to $120 million over the next two years. 

 

 We are also closely monitoring the humanitarian situation.  

 Australia has contributed $23 million to Pakistan in 

 humanitarian assistance since August 2008. 

 

 It is in Australia’s interest, in our region’s interest, and in the 

 international community’s interest, for all of us to give Pakistan 

 as much support as we can.  The implications of instability and 

 an extremist insurgency are serious.  Pakistan’s nuclear status 

 makes these implications all the more troubling.  

 

 Ladies and gentlemen, historically concerns about nuclear 

 weapons have centred on the possibility of their use by states.  

 

 Australia has a strong commitment to strengthening the nuclear 

 non-proliferation regime and achieving progress towards the 

 goal of a world without nuclear weapons. We have been very 

 active and committed participants in international efforts to 

 work towards this end.   

 

 It is now impossible to disregard the concern that nuclear 

 weapons might fall into the hands of terrorists.  This not only 

 underlines the importance of working towards a world without 

 such weapons, but it also underlines the need to secure currently 

 existing weapons of mass destruction and the materials used to 

 produce them. 

 

 The Pakistan Government understands the danger of extremists 

 acquiring nuclear weapons and has dedicated forces protecting 

 their facilities. Pakistan is a member of the global initiative to 

 combat nuclear terrorism. 

 

 We encourage Pakistan to continue efforts to strengthen the 

 protection and control of weapons of mass destruction and 

 sensitive materials and technology. 

 

 Also in the South Asian Crescent, Australia remains deeply 

 concerned about the nature and intent of Iran’s nuclear program, 

 and of course we are not the only member of the international 

 community to have such concerns.  

 

 Reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the 

 IAEA, have consistently shown that Iran has not taken the 

 actions required to assure the international community that its 

 nuclear activities are for exclusively peaceful purposes. 

 

 Iran has not suspended all uranium enrichment and related 

 activities as required by the UN Security Council or cooperated 

 with the IAEA to resolve serious concerns about possible 

 military dimensions to its nuclear activities. 

 

 We believe that Iran should immediately suspend all nuclear 

 enrichment activities, as required by four UN Security Council 

 resolutions, and it should co-operate fully with the International 

 Atomic Energy Agency.  

 

 I understand there are reports today that Iran has rejected the 

 proposal to send low-enriched uranium abroad for further 

 processing and then use in  the Tehran Research reactor. The 

 Australian Government strongly encourages Iran to reconsider 

 its position and accept the proposal brokered by IAEA Director 

 General El Baradei and already agreed to by the United States, 

 Russia and France. We agree with the Director General’s 

 assessment that this represents a unique opportunity for Iran to 

 reverse course from confrontation to cooperation.  

 

 Ladies and gentlemen, the security challenges of the South 

 Asian Crescent are unquestionably complex. Many aspects cross 

 borders, even extend far beyond the region. There is no single, 

 simple approach or solution.  

 

 Many members of the international community work with each 

 other, and with the people and the governments of the region, in 

 the struggle to address those challenges.  Together, we make up 

 a diverse and multinational group, but our interests align, despite 

 sometimes differing approaches or ideas.   

 

 We are there, ultimately, because our governments share with 

 each other the responsibility to protect our nations’ people, 

 assets and interests. 

 

 And because our citizens share with each other, and with the 

 people of the region, the simple and common hope to live in 

 peace and safety; and to see a world in which our children can 

 do the same.  

 

 When H.V. “Doc” Evatt, Australian Foreign Minister and 

 President of the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, 

 wrote the words ‘peace is not divisible’ in the margin of a draft 

 speech in 1950, he was making a moral argument.  

 

 Today, we know all too keenly that it is also a statement of cold, 

 hard fact.
