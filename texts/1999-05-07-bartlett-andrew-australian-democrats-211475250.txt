  MEDIA RELEASE

  Chinese woman highlights need for treatment 
of

  refugees to be more transparent.

  

  The Democrats have renewed their strong support for calls by the Int ernational 
Commission of Jurists, the Law Society and Amnesty International for 
a full Parliamentary inquiry into the Federal Government’s current 
practices as to the determination of refugee status.

  

 The Democrats first called for an inquiry in a dissenting 
report tabled a fortnight ago. This call was renewed in light of evidence 
that a Chinese woman, who was deported and forced to have an abortion 
upon her return.

  

 “Illegal immigrants are apprehended, whisked away 
to Port Hedland and then deported without having had access to advice 
about refugee status unless they specifically request it. It is not 
good enough to hear, years later, that we might have got it wrong,” 
said the Democrats’ spokesperson for immigration, Senator Andrew Bartlett.

  

 “The process for determining refugee status must 
be more transparent. Too often people are returned home to face torture 
or abuse. This is yet another example of flaws in the system.”

  

 The Democrats’ recommendation, tabled in the Parliament 
a fortnight ago, coincides with and supports calls for a full parliamentary 
inquiry made by highly respected organisations who work with refugees.

  

 “We are grateful to Senator Harradine for drawing 
public attention to this issue,” said Senator Bartlett.

  

 The Democrats recommend that an inquiry be held into 
the following:

  

  â¢ the adequacy 
of legal assistance provided to asylum seekers under the Federal Government’s 
Immigration advice and Application Assistance Scheme;

  

  â¢ the adequacy 
of a non-compellable, non-reviewable Ministerial discre tion to 
ensure that no person is forcibly returned to a country where they face 
torture or death;

  

 â¢ whether 
Australia’s treaty commitments to and obligations under the 1951 Convention 
relating to the Status of Refugee, the 1984 UN Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the 
1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are capable 
of being met given the fundamental principle of non-return to face torture 
or death is not present in domestic law nor subject to the rule of law;

  

  â¢ the adequacy 
of current refugee determination procedures having regard to the role 
and function of the Refugee Review Tribunal in investigating asylum 
claims;

  

  â¢ the importance 
of maintaining full judicial oversight of  any administrative 
process that directly affects Australia’s compliance with its international 
legal obligations;

  

  â¢ the accessibility 
of judicial review for impecunious asylum seekers, particularly since 
the removal of grants of aid for asylum seekers in  all instances 
except in extremely limited circumstances; and

  

  â¢ the role and 
involvement of private contractors in removal processes.
