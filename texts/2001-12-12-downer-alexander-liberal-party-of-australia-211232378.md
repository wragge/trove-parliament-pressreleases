 MEDIA RELEASE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER

 FA180 12 December 2001

 FIJI VISIT

 Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer visited Fiji on 12 December 2001.  This was Mr Downer's first visit to Fiji in 18 months.  Its purpose was to strengthen the bilateral relationship, now that Australia's sanctions have been lifted and relations normalised.

 Mr Downer called on the Prime Minister, the Hon Laisenia Qarase, and held substantive talks with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and External Trade, the Hon Kaliopate Tavola. Discussions included the future direction of Australia's bilateral assistance to Fiji; defence cooperation; and cooperation in the areas of people smuggling, transnational crime and terrorism.  Mr Downer announced that from early 2002, two Australian Federal Police Officers would be attached to the Australian High Commission in Suva, to facilitate cooperation with Fiji authorities in combating organised crime.

 Mr Downer noted that Australia’s request for Fiji to host a processing centre for asylum seekers had created widespread debate in Fiji.  Australia welcomed the serious consideration the government of Fiji gave to its request, and in view of Fiji’s current situation, decided to withdraw the request.

 Mr Downer also met members of Parliament and the Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum, and addressed a luncheon hosted by the Fiji-Australia Business Council.

 Mr Downer congratulated the people of Fiji on the way that democracy had been restored and said he was delighted to have the opportunity to be back in Fiji and to resume the mature and sensitive relationship between our two countries.
