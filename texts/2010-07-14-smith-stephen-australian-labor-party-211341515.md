 Interview with Fran Kelly, Radio National 

 Transcript, E&OE 

 Topics: Visit to Indonesia, discussions with East Timor about a regional processing centre, 

 suspected terrorist-linked asylum seeker, relations with Fiji 

 14 July 2010 

 FRAN KELLY: Foreign Minister Stephen Smith leaves this morning for talks with senior Government 

 officials in Jakarta, but he joins us now. Stephen Smith, good morning. 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Good morning, Fran. 

 FRAN KELLY: Now you'll be meeting your Indonesian counterparts to talk about a number of things, 

 including the proposal for a regional processing centre. Exactly what do you want from Indonesia? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: It's a planned visit to Indonesia, it's my sixth visit to Indonesia as Foreign Minister, my 

 first as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. So I'll be meeting with Marty Natalegawa, my counterpart in 

 Foreign Affairs, and Mari Pangestu, my counterpart in Trade. I'll have a conversation with Marty 

 Natalegawa about our approach and proposal for a regional processing centre. Australia and Indonesia of 

 course, co-chair the Bali Process, which is the regional institution of over 40 countries and over a dozen 

 institutions, which tries to deal with people smuggling, human trafficking issues. And under the Bali 

 Process, our officials have been looking at trying to get a better regional framework for some time, but this 

 is the first time that any country has formally proposed a regional processing centre. So I'll go through that 

 with Marty Natalegawa... 

 FRAN KELLY: The early signs aren't that positive, are they? Isn't Indonesia indicating it's not keen on the 

 idea of an East Timor processing centre? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well no, that's not right. I've spoken to Marty Natalegawa, we gave Indonesian officials 

 the courtesy of letting them know that the Prime Minister would be making her speech last week. I spoke to 

 Marty Natalegawa on the day of the speech and we agreed that we'd have a conversation as part of my 

 planned visit to Jakarta, but I'll go through the proposal with him. 

 Our officials have been in East Timor for the last couple of days, they've now left, but they've had very good 

 conversations with East Timorese officials. 

 FRAN KELLY: How good, how encouraging, given that the vote in the Parliament this week was not 

 encouraging? Are you getting any different sort of noises, from these talks with the officials? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: The East Timorese Government position has not changed, which is that they are in 

 conversation, in discussion with Australia. Yes, there was a resolution in their Parliament, but I've urged 

 people not to over-interpret that, or read too much into it. 

 East Timorese Ministers don't sit in the Parliament, it's a reflection of those Members of the Parliament who 

 were there at the time. The East Timorese Government's position is that they are having a conversation 

 with Australia. In the course of the second half of this week, I'll probably have a conversation with my East 

 Timorese counterpart, Zacarias da Costa, about the progress of those talks. 

 FRAN KELLY: Will you also have a conversation with Nauru, because the President of Nauru has 

 indicated that they want a conversation too, they're keen, they're even prepared to sign up, it seems, to the 

 UN Refugee Convention, in order to be a part of this kind of solution? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well our focus is very squarely on East Timor, and... 

 FRAN KELLY: Why though, why not consider Nauru, given there's a detention centre already there? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Our focus is on East Timor firstly. Secondly, I've said - Immigration Minister Chris 

 Evans has said - if other countries in the region indicate an interest, that'll be a matter for them. And we 

 welcome the fact that Nauru has indicated it's proposing to ratify the Refugee Convention. We encourage 

 any country who's not a signatory to the Convention to sign up, so we welcome that. 

 But our focus is on our discussions with East Timor, about the notion of a regional processing centre, which 

 we... 

 FRAN KELLY: I understand that's where your focus has been, and that's what the Prime Minister's kicked 

 this off with, but why, in your view, would East Timor be a better solution than Nauru? I guess particularly 

 given that Nauru already has some kind of Australian-built detention centre there? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well, we are focusing on East Timor, and... 

 FRAN KELLY: Why though? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well because we believe that is the appropriate place for us to have a conversation. 

 Nauru was used by the Howard Government, and I choose my words carefully, used by the Howard 

 Government. They're still not a signatory to the Refugee Convention. If they sign up, that's a good thing, 

 but we are in conversation with East Timor about a regional processing centre, because we believe a 

 regional processing centre would reduce the incentive for secondary movement, would reduce the 

 incentives for people to get on boats and risk their lives on the high seas, but also lead to better 

 assessments throughout the region, better standardised assessments through the region. It's a big 

 project... 

 FRAN KELLY: But why would East Timor be a better location for that than Nauru, that's all I'm wondering. 

 Why, in the Australian Government’s view, is East Timor a better solution than Nauru? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Nauru is not currently a signatory to the Refugee Convention, that's the first point. 

 Secondly, we've made it clear to them... 

 FRAN KELLY: If they sign up? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well, Nauru's indicated an intention to do that, let's wait and see. And we welcome the 

 fact it's indicated that intention. But there is some fundamental policy fabric here that we need to have. 

 Firstly, we believe very importantly it's got to have the support, the endorsement, the agreement of the 

 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The Howard Government's Pacific Solution, in particular 

 Nauru, did not have that support, on the contrary it was roundly criticised by the UNHCR because Nauru 

 was not, and is not, a signatory to the Convention. 

 But secondly, we need to also ensure that not only is there regional support, either formally through the Bali 

 Process, or generally throughout the region, we've also got to get support from those settlement and 

 resettlement countries who have traditionally taken refugees from our region. New Zealand is one of those, 

 the United States, Canada, the European countries. 

 So this is an extensive conversation, which is why it's not going to be solved in one day, or one week, or in 

 one meeting with officials. 

 FRAN KELLY: Okay, Minister, we'd best move on, there's only two minutes to the news. The Australian 

 newspaper has reported today that Indonesian authorities are concerned that someone they describe as a 

 senior al-Qaeda figure from Afghanistan has ended up in detention in Indonesia, in amongst a group of 

 asylum seekers intercepted before they could embark on a boat trip to Australia. Do you know anything of 

 this? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: I can't and won't comment on the particular individual case, but suffice to say we work 

 very closely with Indonesia on counter-terrorism matters. And anyone who claims asylum to come to 

 Australia has to, if their refugee application is successful, has to pass the most stringent health, quarantine 

 and security assessments done by ASIO. So it's no surprise to us that Indonesia is working very 

 assiduously in this area. We've got good cooperation with them, and they're very conscious of it. 

 FRAN KELLY: And very briefly Minister, to Fiji, where the Acting High Commissioner for Australia, Sarah 

 Roberts, flies home today after being expelled. Now Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama says because of 

 interference from Australia, he's considering cancelling elections in 2014. 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well, it's just a ruse by the Commodore. He promised his Pacific Island Forum leaders 

 an election in the first quarter of 2009. That's come and gone. It would be no surprise if he didn't effect 

 elections by 2014, but we want elections before then. We want to continue our efforts of dialogue with Fiji, 

 through the Pacific Islands Forum, to get them back to a path for democracy. And the suggestions, the 

 allegations, the rhetoric about Australian or New Zealand interference, are frankly just nonsense, it's just an 

 excuse by Commodore Bainimarama. 

 But we will persist, we won't give up. It is hard to have a one-way dialogue, but we're not going to give up. 

 FRAN KELLY: Alright, Stephen Smith, we've got to go, the news is upon us, but I guess you're following 

 your namesake in his test debut against Pakistan, Steven Smith the bowler? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: I met him in India, he gave me his New South Wales jumper, and I told Simon Katich, 

 the West Australian captain of the New South Wales team that when he made, when Steven Smith made 

 his test debut, I'd wear his jumper, which I did. 

 FRAN KELLY: Good on you. Stephen Smith, thanks for joining us, it's eight o'clock. 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Thanks, Fran.
