 Long-Term Detainees to be Considered for New Removal Pending  Bridging Visa

 VPS 058/2005

 Twenty one people will be the first to be considered for the new class of bridging visa for long term detainees, the Minister for Immigration,  Amanda Vanstone, announced today. 

 ‘In addition to 14 people in immigration detention, seven former detainees already living in the community on Bridging Visas will also be  considered for the visa.

 ‘This visa, which I announced in March, came into effect on Wednesday, is only available to a relatively small number of people who have been  cooperating with my department’s efforts to remove them but who, for a variety of reasons, cannot be removed in the near future and who have  also concluded all legal and review processes.

 ‘After a review of the detention caseload by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, 14 people in immigration  detention, some of them for up to five years and including three family groups, were identified as potentially meeting the criteria.

 ‘My department will continually review the detention caseload to identify further cases where it may be appropriate for me to consider offering  individuals the new visa.

 ‘Grant of this new visa to those now in the community on a Bridging Visa will extend to them benefits, such as access to Centrelink Special  Benefit and the right to work.

 The Minister said there was no formal application process for the new visa and access is dependent on an invitation from the Minister and  eligibility against the criteria for the visa, which includes character and security checks. 

 The Minister said the key element of the Government’s policy to remove people with no lawful basis to remain in Australia remains unaffected by  these new measures which apply only to those people found not be owed protection, who have exhausted their appeal processes and who, through  no fault of their own, cannot return to their home country in the short term.
