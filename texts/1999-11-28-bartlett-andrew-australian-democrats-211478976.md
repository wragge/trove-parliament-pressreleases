  Federal Minister must not deport

  Tasmania's Kosovo refugees

  

  

 Compassion and commonsense should guide the Government 
to allow those Kosovo refugees in Tasmania who wish to remain, to do 
so, according to the Australian Democrats.

  

 The Government and people of Tasmania have made 
it clear they are willing to accept the Kosovo refugees into their community. 
It would be wrong of the federal Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock 
to over rule that," said Democrats' immigration spokesperson, Senator 
Andrew Bartlett.

  

 "Tasmania's population is in decline. We need 
people and these people want to be here. It is ludicrous that we would 
force the Kosovo refugees to leave."

  

 The Australian Democrats have opposed the introduction 
of temporary visas for refugees.

  

 "Refugees have been through horrendous experiences. 
We should do nothing to continue that hardship," said Senator Bartlett.

  

 "Australia has a long tradition of refugees 
coming here, building new lives and contributing to the community. It 
is one of the defining characteristics of Australia," he concluded.
