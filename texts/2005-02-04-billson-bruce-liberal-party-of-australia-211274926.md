 ‘This latest contribution will help more than 11,000 people affected by the volcano which  has spewed ash onto nearby villages, contaminating the water supply and destroying  homes,’ Mr Billson said.   

 ‘Funding will be directed through non-government aid organisations currently working in  PNG and assist in providing safe drinking water, toilets and hygiene training for people now  living in care centres on the mainland.   

 ‘More than $210,000 will be channelled through World Vision to provide critical health  services for displaced people and $85,000 to CARE Australia to assist the Provincial  Disaster Office manage the relief operation,’ Mr Billson said.   

 ‘This latest contribution follows nearly $70,000 provided by the Australian Government last  December to the Australian Red Cross.
