 UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ON US REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT DEAL    

 Despite Australians being assured the US refugee resettlement arrangement will be  honoured, the Turnbull Government can’t answer basic questions about how it will work.     

 There are too many unanswered questions and too many refugees once again left in  limbo.    

 Labor supports third-country resettlement of refugees in offshore detention and is  pleased the agreement with the United States will be honoured. But the Government  has been silent on the details of this arrangement, and how recent decisions of the US  administration may impact on it.       

 How many refugees will be resettled in the United States as part of the deal and when  will refugees begin to arrive in the United States for resettlement?    

 There are refugees on Manus Island and Nauru from nations that are currently banned  from entering the United States. Has the Prime Minister sought assurances that they will  be considered outside the Executive Order or will they be considered and then excluded  based on their country of origin?     

 What will happen to those refugees in Manus Island and Nauru who are ineligible for  resettlement as part of the US agreement?    

 Regional processing centres were never designed for long-term detention centres.     

 The Turnbull Government’s incompetence and inability to secure other viable third  country resettlement arrangements is yet again leaving refugees in limbo.     

 The Prime Minister should immediately clarify the details of the US resettlement  arrangement, and explain what other third country resettlement options he has secured.
