  AYERS REPORT COMPLETE

  

  An independent inquiry into the case of a Chinese woman allegedly 
returned to China to face a forc ed abortion has found that all 
actions taken by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 
were lawful, and that the woman’s treatment in Australia was humane.

  

 “Mr Tony Ayers AC was appointed to undertake the 
inquiry I announced on 10 May this year,” the Minister for Immigration 
and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock said today.

  

 “Mr Ayers completed his inquiry into the case and 
delivered his report to me on Thursday 9 September.

  

 “Mr Ayers found that the Chinese woman had an abortion 
in the PRC when she was eight and a half months pregnant. However, he 
was unable to reach a conclusion about whether or not that abortion 
was forced.

  

 “The report also provided a number of recommendations 
about general procedural improvements. Officers of my Department are 
examining Mr Ayers’ findings closely and will carefully consider the 
recommendations he has made.”

  

 The Minister went on to say that the Senate Legal 
and Constitutional References Committee, chaired by Senator Jim McKiernan, 
was currently conducting an inquiry into the operation of Australia’s 
refugee and humanitarian program. Three of the Committee’s specific 
terms of reference mention the case of the Chinese woman.

  

 “The Committee’s terms of reference are broader 
than those of Mr Ayers’ and they have been tasked by Parliament with 
this inquiry.

  

 “I undertook to provide a copy of Mr Ayers’ report 
to the Committee, which I have now done,” Mr Ruddock said.

  

 “However, given the large amount of personal information 
about the Chinese woman contained in the report I do not intend to release 
it publicly.

  

 “Consistent with the Senate Committee’s approach 
to maintaining the privacy of the Chinese woman I have also requested 
that Mr Ayers’ report be kept confidential and that orders forbidding 
its publication or release are made.” Mr Ruddock concluded.
