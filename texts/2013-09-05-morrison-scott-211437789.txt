 SCOTT MORRISON:    

 I’d like to make a brief statement in terms of the very disturbing incident that took place  overnight in Berala where I understand an accused man has now been taken into custody  and there has been an approach made to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship  regarding that person’s immigration status.  There have been difficulties from a language  point of view in terms of being able to establish the person’s identity and how they  happened to be in Australia.  My understanding, I have been advised through the  Department of Immigration and Citizenship this morning that their initial advice is that  the individual was on a bridging visa and we will have to await further confirmation of  those facts as the day unfolds.  This is a very concerning and a very disturbing  development and I think it’s important that the Minister for Immigration throughout the  course of the day, and the sooner the better once these facts are able to be established, can  confirm the facts in this case and confirm the status of the individual and what the  government’s response to these incidents are.      

 QUESTION:   

 Apart from the stabbing, I mean what is the disturbing aspect of this as far as you’re  concerned?    

 MORRISON:   

 Well, anyone who’s stabbed in an incident such as this I think is very disturbing.  I think  that speaks for itself.  The police who were called out to this incident last night would  have had no knowledge of the immigration status of people behind that door.  The  Coalition has said now for some time and we confirmed last weekend that it is the  Coalition’s policy that any person who is on a bridging visa and released into the  community, their address details would be available to the police.  That’s a statement of  policy.  Now whether that would have applied in this case or not, we don’t know one way  or the other yet but I do stress that the Department has advised that their initial  understanding, their initial advice is that the accused was on a bridging visa but I will  await further statements from the Minister today and I would hope and expect that he  would seek to inform people on that as soon as he is able.      

 QUESTION:   

 Just to be clear, you’re saying he’s an asylum seeker who is on a bridging visa, is that  your initial advice?      

 MORRISON:   

 That’s the initial advice from the Department.      

 QUESTION:   

 Do you know what nationality he is?    

 MORRISON:   

 No, I don’t have those details.  I understand the police have some understanding of that  and that’s what’s been raised with the Department and I hope these matters are clarified  over the course of the day and I think it’s important the Australian people know what the  situation here is and I would ask the Minister to make a statement on this matter as soon  as he can.      

 QUESTION:    

 Are you trying to stir up fear within the community about refugees?    

 MORRISON:    

 No I’m simply expressing my concern at a very serious incident that took place overnight  and asking the Minister to be able to make a statement later today on what the facts are.    

 QUESTION: 

 

 Stabbings are serious, I think we’d all acknowledge that stabbings are serious, but what is  it about this case that warrants the intervention of the Shadow Minister, the man most  likely - you know - might become Minister?    

 MORRISON:   

 As I said, the initial advice is from DIAC that the individual concerned here is on a  bridging visa and has been released into the community.  So I’m asking the Minister to  clarify the situation and what the government’s response is from an immigration  perspective.      

 QUESTION:   

 Precisely what is your concern?    

 MORRISON:   

 Well I think I’ve already outlined that.     

 QUESTION:   

 I don’t understand what your concern is though?    

 MORRISON:   

 Well I can only refer you back to the comments I’ve already made.  I’ve asked the  Minister to come and clarify the situation.  I’d like him to do that as soon as he’s able and  I look forward to him making that statement.      

 QUESTION:   

 Has asylum seeker policy and your border protection policy been costed by the  Parliamentary Budget Office?    

 MORRISON:   

 Those costings and details have all been released today but I’m just commenting on that  issue today.     

 QUESTION:   

 Well I want to talk about, to ask you about the border protection policy...    

 MORRISON: 

 

 I’ve conducted many press conferences on these issues.  All of our costings are included  in the statements that have been issued by the Shadow Treasurer today and I refer you to  those.      

 QUESTION:   

 But it’s your portfolio, can’t you talk about it?    

 MORRISON:   

 Well I’ve said all of our costings have been included in that document and they’ve been  cleared by the process that Joe Hockey and the economic team have put together so we  stand by those and they present a very robust assessment and conservative assessment of  the gains that we know we can make by stopping the boats.  Any other questions on any  other matters because I have to get to somewhere else.    

 QUESTION: 

 If the Coalition is elected will you travel to Indonesia, PNG or Nauru to lock in your  asylum seeker policy? 

 MORRISON:    

 All of those countries are places that we will need to visit in due course to ensure that we  are able to implement our policy swiftly and effectively.      

 QUESTION:   

 Just on last night’s incident, do you have - and related matters - do you have any evidence  or is there any suggestion that asylum seekers are over-represented in crime statistics?    

 MORRISON:   

 No I’ve never suggested that and I’m not making that suggestion now.      

 QUESTION:   

 Can you just clarify what exact difference it makes that this man is on a bridging visa?      

 MORRISON:   

 Well that it is just simply a fact I’m asking the Minister to confirm today and that is what  the Department has advised me, that this individual, their initial advice is that he’s on a  bridging visa and I’m asking the Minister to confirm that over the course of the day.      

 QUESTION: 

 

 Are you saying the police didn’t know where he was?  Didn’t know where the man was  in the community?      

 MORRISON:   

 The police wouldn’t know the address details of any bridging visa holder in Australia  because the Labor Government has refused to provide those details despite the requests  of all State and Territory Police Commissioners.  They have consistently refused to  provide that information to police, that’s a matter of record.  The Coalition has a  completely different approach on that issue.      

 QUESTION:   

 Is there any suggestion though that the operational handling of this matter would have  been different if they’d known that he’s an asylum seeker?  I mean, a guy waving a knife  is a guy waving a knife, isn’t he?      

 MORRISON:   

 Well individuals come from all sorts of different backgrounds and how long they’ve been  in Australia and what backgrounds they may have come from I think that’s helpful  information for police if they’re knocking on a particular door.  They’re the issues that  have been raised with me by police and that is what they advise me, together with  ensuring the safety and protection of people released on bridging visas into the  community is as good as it can be.  The police have expressed to me now over some time  that they have needed access to this information, not only from a general community  point of view but to ensure that they’re in the best position to be able to provide the right  sort of support and protection to people who are released into the community.  They’ve  been making these requests now for some time and the government has been refusing  those requests for some time.  So it’s for them to explain why they have done that but on  this occasion I’m just simply noting that this terrible incident has occurred.  Our initial  advice is that that individual accused is on a bridging visa and I’ve asked the Minister to  confirm that as soon as he’s able.  Ok.      

 QUESTION:   

 [Inaudible] The victim, was he an asylum seeker?      

 MORRISON:   

 Again, my advice only extends to the individual who is accused at this stage.  Ok thank  you.
