 Another 13,000 Refugees to Call Australia Home 

 As issued by Minister on Tuesday 2 May 2006 

 Australia will again embrace another 13 000 refugees under the humanitarian program in 2006-07. 

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, said it was a credit to the  Howard Government and Australia that we have been able to maintain this high intake. 

 “We are a multicultural country. Australians can be very proud that we are the third largest  taker of refugees in the world,” Senator Vanstone said. 

 “Of the 13 000 places, 6000 will be allocated for refugees referred to Australia for resettlement  by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] and 7000 places for the  Special Humanitarian Program [SHP] and protection visas. 

 “As in the past, the target for the women at risk category will be 10.5 per cent of the offshore  refugee category. 

 “This is an orderly program utilised by genuine refugees, who have used the correct avenues to  ensure they can call a free country such as Australia home. 

 “With the Government’s tightened policies on illegal boat arrivals, stemming the flow of several  years ago, Australia has been able to welcome many more in need.”  

 Senator Vanstone said recent initiatives introduced by the Government have greatly enhanced  the delivery of the humanitarian program and services available to humanitarian entrants. 

 “Refugee support groups have commended these initiatives, which are a result of the  Government’s investment of $267.6 million in 2004-05 to improve settlement services for  humanitarian entrants over a four-year period,” the Minister said. 

 “We will continue to build on these efforts and expand humanitarian settlement in regional  areas.” 

 “We will continue to resettle people in vulnerable situations from around the world, based on  priority regions identified with the UNHCR, we can expect to resettle more refugees from Asia  and resettlement from Africa is likely to lessen because of the ongoing repatriation of a large  number of African nationals.” 

 Under the Howard Coalition Government, more than 100 000 people have arrived in Australia

 on humanitarian grounds. 

 “Many Australians have warmly welcomed recent arrivals under the humanitarian program and  I’m grateful to the Australian community for their support to humanitarian entrants over many  decades,” Senator Vanstone said. 

 “People who arrive under our humanitarian program have fled their countries and familiar  surroundings in search of safety and stability and it is our responsibility to help them rebuild  their lives in Australia.”
