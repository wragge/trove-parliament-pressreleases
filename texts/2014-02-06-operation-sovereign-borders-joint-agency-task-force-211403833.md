 Sri Lankan boat arrivals returned to Colombo - Minister  for Immigration and Border Protection 

 06-02-2014 -  

 The Australian Government has today successfully returned 45 Sri Lankans who arrived  illegally in Australia by boat. 

 All 45 detainees were screened out of a protection assessment process. Eight of the detainees  chose to return voluntarily. 

 As they had no matters ongoing with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection,  they were removed. This is consistent with Australia’s obligations. 

 “We will never allow people who come illegally by boat to settle here,” Scott Morrison said. 

 Mr Morrison said the Australian Government’s message is crystal clear: you should not come  because you will not be allowed to stay. 

 “Anyone who arrives by boat illegally will either be sent to Papua New Guinea or Nauru, or  sent home,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “The Australian Government does not deal in half measures and has the policies and resolve  to fight people smugglers and stop illegal boat arrivals. “The government will continue to  return people seeking to come to Australia illegally by boat.” 

 Today’s voluntary returnees may be helped to resume their lives in Sri Lanka by a  reintegration assistance program. The assistance is available only to those who voluntarily  agree to return to their country of origin.
