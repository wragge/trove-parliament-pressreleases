 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Monday, 31 March 2014 

 Cutting legal aid to refugees, dangerous and  short-sighted  The Government’s decision to cut legal aid to refugees is both cruel and short-sighted, the Australian  Greens have said. 

 “This is an illogical, ideological attack on vulnerable people from a Government that is obsessed with  denying protection to as many refugees as possible,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson,  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said. 

 “Refugees have broken no laws by coming to Australia and asking for protection, but this  Government is treating them worse than murderers, rapists and white collar criminals. 

 “Helping people to complete their refugee claim means they aren't kept in detention longer than is  needed, and that saves the Government money in the long run. It costs far more to keep refugees  locked up unnecessarily than it does to give them basic legal help. 

 “By axing assistance to refugees, the Abbott Government is forcing community groups and churches  to pick up the slack and do what’s right.  That's not fair and it shows just how little Mr Abbott cares  about the impacts of his aggressive policy.  

 “We already have dozens of people indefinitely detained with no hope of release and now the  Government is taking away their access to legal representation. 

 “This is just more cruelty from a short-sighted Government that is obsessed with playing to the  bigots.”
