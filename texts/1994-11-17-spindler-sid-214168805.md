 Australian Democrat  Senator for Victoria

 Refugees treated like cattle  as compulsory repatriation  program begins "ÎÎ Î§  eports are coming in from Port Hedland where refugees are believed to 

 have been bound hand and foot, and bundled struggling onto planes like  - L · . X x attle, as the Commonwealth Government's compulsorily repatriation 

 program begins.

 This was despite the fact that an injunction was being actively sought in the  Federal Court by the refugees’ solicitors in Melbourne— "This is a flagrant  disregard for due process and a day of disgrace for the nation," said Democrat  Senator Sid Spindler Law and Justice Spokesperson.

 "Many of these refugees left their native countries and families, enduring squalid  conditions and treacherous seas for what they thought might prove to be a better  life in Australia—and this is how they are treated."

 The move was made two days after the Migration Legislation Amendment Act  #4, was assented to. The Act gives the government the capacity to compulsorily  repatriate applicants who have been processed for refugee status in certain places 

 outside Australia.

 This was despite allegations of widespread corruption at the processing centre at  Galang where refugee status was said to have been granted on the basis of sexual  favours or US dollars.

 "These refugees have risked life and limb for what they thought was the just and  open society of Australia-a society that is supposed to have respect for the rule of  law— and this is how they are treated. It is an absolute disgrace," Senator  Spindler concluded.
