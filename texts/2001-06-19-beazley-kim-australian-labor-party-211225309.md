 Kim Beazley - Doorstop Interview Subjects: Government Advertising, Polls, Detention Centres

 Transcript - Parliament House, Canberra - 19 June 2001

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 BEAZLEY: The Government is trying to buy this election with your money - $500,000 a night some nights of the week - money that ought to be being spent on hospitals and schools, on teachers and procedures in hospitals - being spent on the re-election of this Government. This is wholesale looting of the public purse for the benefit of a political party -not for the benefit of the taxpayers from whom the money was drawn.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, is there a risk that the public is once again going to become jaded with politicians who, both sides are complaining about spending on advertising but neither side doing about it?

 BEAZLEY: We are. We have a Bill that we are putting into the House today that would put decent standards, impose decent standards on governments - the standards the Auditor-General has asked for so that government campaigns cease to be propaganda and become genuinely information based. Somebody has got to put a stop to this. One side of politics has got to stand up and say, 'no more. There's going to be no more stealing from the public in order to benefit ourselves politically'. It's got to stop. And the Bill that we put forward will stop it.

 JOURNALIST: What will you do?

 BEAZLEY: The Bill will eliminate all forms of political advocacy from any of the advertising. It will impose on it factual character. And once you do that what you do, of course, is you remove the incentive to spend that money. Look what you've got now. Every pensioner automatically gets the $300 that the Government announced in the Budget. The Government knows who they are, they pay the $300 - that is, every old aged pensioner automatically gets it. After they have it, the Government is going to spend $3 million to $5 million on advertising. Under the sorts of guidelines we have, that would be impossible -you couldn't do that. You would then find yourself facing charges. And so governments should. Governments have got to start being a bit accountable. And we have got to stop looting the taxpayers' purse to pay for the advertising of the political parties, in this case, the Government. There is a proper place for public funding and that occurs during the election campaign. But what this means is that

 governments have an incentive to spend hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds on protecting themselves - $500 million on the GST - think of what that would have done for the education and hospital system of this country - $500 million. It is actually a disgrace. And we are going to keep hitting this until the election day.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, are you concerned by the latest Newspoll showing Labor taking a bit hit in favour of the Government?

 BEAZLEY: The polls bounce around. It seems to me prima facie unlikely that a million people change their minds every two weeks. And if you take a look at the bumping up and down of the Newspoll, because a few weeks ago we had a Newspoll that suggested the Government would win, and then we had another suggesting Labor in a landslide, and then we have another poll that suggests the Government should win. I mean, all this means, really, is we can't afford to be complacent. It's very hard to beat a government that is prepared to spend millions and millions of taxpayers' dollars advocating itself. This is also a Government trying to distract people's attention from the way in which they have so severely punished them. The Government will talk about anything but the GST's impact on the lives of people. They will talk about anything but what they've done to public schools. They don't want to talk about public hospitals at all, they say it's a problem for the States. The problems that people feel in their lives, the Government wishes to distract them from. Sometimes that strategy works, and sometimes it doesn't. And the job of an opposition is to shine a light on them.

 JOURNALIST: What do you think of Minister Ruddocks's response to the immigration centre report?

 BEAZLEY: Well, emus don't burry their heads in the sand, ostriches do. He's a bit out of his country, I think. I think the simple fact of the matter is that there's something wrong, it's a mess. You've got to fix the mess. You know, we have to have a situation in which people are apprehended who illegally enter this country, you can't get around that, you have to have that. But you've got to say, what we're doing now isn't working. We've got to have a better coastguard, we have got to get a better mechanism for dealing with people when they're here. That's a bipartisan committee report. It suggested, for example, that there ought to be a high security area and troublemakers put in that, rather than mixed with everybody else. And the threatened problems that arise for the families of some as a result of it. These are ideas that are worth a look. Personally, what I think what we need is a proper judicial inquiry into these processes. We've got to, as I said, apprehend people who come illegally into this country. But what the Government is doing now is just making a total mess of it. They quite like talking about it, but they don't like solving it.

 JOURNALIST: Is it a bit insulting towards the members of the committee to be labelled as naive?

 BEAZLEY: The Government wants to try to use this as a bit of an issue to cover the mess it's made on things like the GST. And so I think Ruddock is trying to pick a fight with a committee which has actually sat down there and done what parliamentary committees are supposed to do in a bipartisan and serious way consider a problem. So, I think Ruddock actually relishes a fight with this particular committee because he thinks he gets brownie points out there in the public. The public wants solutions. And this Government isn't providing solutions. The committee is suggesting some solutions, they may, or they may not work. The idea of a high security area, so trouble makers are put in that and not mix with the general batch of refugees - it may or may not work but it certainly is worth an independent judicial look at it and they'll get it from us.
