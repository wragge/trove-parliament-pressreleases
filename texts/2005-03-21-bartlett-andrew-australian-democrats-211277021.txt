 Australian Democrats Press  Releases

 Small changes on detention wont fix the problem

 The Australian Democrats have welcomed reports that the Government is considering changing its  mandatory detention policy, but have warned that minor changes will not fix the problems.

 Democrats Deputy Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said this is a major problem of the Governments own  making and it wont be fixed by a bit of tinkering around the edges.

 If the Government just releases a few more people into the community, like Christians who face persecution  in their own states, but leaves them relying on charity to survive, they will just be conning the Australian  people and continuing the suffering of innocent people, Senator Bartlett said.

 The Prime Minister has already stated that the Government is not intending to make any major changes to its  immigration detention policy, but unless major changes are made, the enormous and unnecessary suffering  will continue.

 There is absolutely no evidence that mandatory detention is any deterrent to asylum seekers. The bottom line  is that no one should be imprisoned for years when they have not been accused of any crime. Until this basic  right is restored, the problem will remain.

 Senator Bartlett also warned that detainees on Nauru and Christmas Island are suffering just as much as  people locked up on the Australian mainland and must also be assisted. Senator Bartlett is the only federal  politician to visit the asylum seekers on Christmas Island and Nauru.

 I can say from first hand experience that the suffering being endured by detainees is enormous. When I was  last on Nauru in early 2004, the levels of despair and depression were plain to see. While many have been  released since then, the misery of those that remain is overwhelming.

 The Democrats believe the minimum changes the Government must make include:

 Releasing all long-term asylum seekers from mandatory detention, including those on Nauru and Christmas  Island, into the Australian community;

 Ensuring all asylum seekers in the community have the opportunity to support themselves, rather than having  to rely on charity for months or years to survive, as happens currently;

 Letting refugees on temporary visas have access to English language classes and skills upgrades so the  Australian community can benefit from the qualifications and skills that many of them already possess;

 Lifting the prohibition on families of refugees on temporary visas from being able to re-unite with them in  Australia, thus ensuring that the skills that those refugees possess can fully contribute to Australia.
