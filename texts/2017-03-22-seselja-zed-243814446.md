 E&OE… 

 ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SERVICES: 

 Welcome all. It’s great to be here in Red Hill at the Playground Early Learning Centre. And thank you to  Pina, who runs the centre so well and the owners George and Mary-Anne for welcoming us here today. 

 It's great to be here to be talking about the importance of child care. Child care, of course, is important  to so many families, not just here in the ACT, but right around the nation.  

 So it's great to have the Prime Minister here and I welcome him. 

 PRIME MINISTER:  

 Thank you very much, Zed. It's great to be here, also with Birmo, the Education Minister. The child care  reforms which we are seeking the Senate's support for, are so important for so many Australian families,  particularly those on lower and lower-middle incomes.  

 Under our reforms child care will be more available and will be fairer.  

 A family on an income of $50,000 a year will be able to access high-quality child care and preschool,  early learning for about $15 a day. That's a very, very significant increase in support.  

 We need the support of the Senate to get these reforms through. It is going to make child care fairer, it's  going to make it more available, it's going to mean that more mums and dads will be able to work the  hours they choose and get better balance - work and family.  

 So centres like Pina's will have support from the Government, support from families. It’s critically  important to ensure productivity and for ensuring that we have strong healthy families and parents that  are able to stay engaged with the workforce. It’s a very important social and economic reform and we  are urging the Senate and all the parties in the Senate to get behind it. Birmo? 

 MINISTER FOR EDUCATION: 

 Thanks PM, Zed and thanks all for coming out this morning. Our child care reforms will make Australian  child care more affordable, more accessible, more available to Australian families.  

 The benefits are real and tangible. Our reforms will increase the rate of subsidy for low and middle-income families. They will remove the $7,500 cap, the cliff that many families fall off midyear in terms of  the support they receive.  

 They will put in place a new mechanism to keep a downward pressure on fee increases in future, helping  families and taxpayers from ever-escalating child care costs under current settings.  

 They remove a whole lot of red tape for child care providers that will enable them to spend more time  caring for children, educating children and less time worrying about the paperwork of running a child  care system.  

 They are well thought out, they are well considered. They went through a comprehensive Productivity  Commission inquiry. They have been through three different Senate inquiries. Now is the time to see  these reforms passed through the Parliament.  

 Discussions are constructive and we are eager to make sure they are finalised and that we get these  important reforms through to help hard-working, low-income Australian families. 

 PRIME MINISTER:  

 Very good. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 Minister Birmingham, can you please explain what changes you are making to ensure the child care  package passes the Senate? 

 MINISTER FOR EDUCATION: 

 We are continuing discussions and as our Government has been so successful at doing since the last  election with this Senate, we will continue those discussions in private with all the different parties in  the Senate to make sure we get these reforms through. They are constructive discussions and we’re  making good progress. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 Are you splitting up the Omnibus Bill? 

 MINISTER FOR EDUCATION: 

 We obviously want to make sure these reforms, a $1.6 billion additional investment into child care and  early education, are paid for. We don't want to see children in today's services going into the workforce  in future with a bigger level of debt than is necessary. It’s important, it’s critical, to make sure that extra 

 investment, extra spending from Government in child care services, is funded and paid for. They’re they  are the discussions we are having. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 Prime Minister, just to be clear are you cutting up the Omnibus Bill Prime Minister? Just to be  categorically clear, are you cutting up the Omnibus Bill? 

 PRIME MINISTER: 

 Well, as Senator Birmingham has said, we continue our discussions with the crossbench. We've had a lot  of success in the past in circumstances where even members of the Press Gallery have predicted that we  would have no success. So we will continue.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 But you haven’t given up on them? 

 PRIME MINISTER: 

 No, we will continue our negotiations and discussions, but the important thing is that these very  valuable reforms are supported. We seek the support of the Senate for them. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 Will you push ahead with cuts to Family Tax Benefits? 

 PRIME MINISTER: 

 As I said, all of the reforms that we have set out, both in the Budget and then in MYEFO, we are  pursuing. But of course we continue to negotiate with the crossbench in the Senate and we are looking  forward to resolving these issues. The important thing is, for the sake of these little kids and their  parents and many others like them, that these reforms are passed.  

 As Senator Birmingham said, they have been widely applauded through the sector, through the  community, they've come through the Productivity Commission's work. This has been a very well-designed reform of child care and it deserves the support of the Parliament, and in particular the  Senate. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 You only linked the child care reforms with the welfare measures to pay for it about a month ago- 

 PRIME MINISTER: 

 Just to pay for it, yes. Well, paying for it is very important actually, for the that reasons that Birmo said. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 You only linked them in the Omnibus Bill a month ago, isn’t splitting the Bill up an admission of that  political tactic fail? 

 MINISTER FOR EDUCATION: 

 That's not correct. We've been very clear. Ever since the child care reforms were released, they had to  be fully funded. There have been measures in relation to Family Tax Benefit reform that have been  there, clearly earmarked - to fund the child care reform. It remains our position that they must be fully  funded so we don't increase the debt legacy on future generations. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 But the Omnibus Bill was a bad idea? 

 MINISTER FOR EDUCATION: 

 We are working through to make sure we get an outcome. In the end the important thing and the thing  that this Government has demonstrated is our priority is getting outcomes. Getting outcomes that help  Australians to deal with the challenges we face.  

 We face challenges in workforce productivity and participation, where child care costs are a barrier. We  are fixing that through these child care reforms.  

 We face problems, though, in terms of the size of the debt and deficit scale we face. We’re addressing  that through spending restraint and through the types of savings measures that I’ve identified. We are  seeking to progress them both. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 On another Senate issue, Prime Minister, on 18C, it pretty clear that Nick Xenophon is not going to go  through for the changes. So is this so much political hurt that your Government has to go through for a  Bill that’s doomed to fail? 

 PRIME MINISTER: 

 I recall you predicting many elements of our legislative program are doomed to fail, and you've been  disappointed in the past. So we’ll just focus on getting on our agenda through the Senate. We will  continue to negotiate with all parties in the Senate in every field, as we have done, and we have  delivered considerable achievements. As I said, many of which you and others in the gallery predicted  would not find success. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 Just to clarify on the child care though, in order to ensure that the child care package passes, you will  have to make changes to how the Omnibus Bill currently stands? 

 PRIME MINISTER:  

 Again, we will continue negotiating with the crossbench and we negotiate with the crossbench. All of us,  all of my Ministers and myself, we’ve all been invited to speculate publically about the course of  negotiations with the crossbench. And we decline to do so because as Birmo said, we are focused on  results and outcomes. And we’ve found the best way to negotiate with the crossbench is to negotiate  directly with them rather than through the pages and screens of the media. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 Is Peter Dutton secretly negotiating for gay marriage behind the scenes? 

 PRIME MINISTER:  

 Look, again, our position on that matter is very clear. The barrier to - the obstacle to same-sex marriage  being lawful in Australia is Bill Shorten. We went to the election with a policy for a plebiscite which  would give every Australian a say. It’s a plebiscite, I might say, that Mr Shorten himself had supported  only three years ago. But on so many things he has done a backflip, he is inconsistent, has no regard to  what he said in the past and yet again - so he has done a switch and he is the one that is denying same-sex couples the right to marry. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 This is a matter you would like to see decided before the next election because deep down you probably  fear that taking it to an election is going to hurt the Coalition, isn't it? 

 PRIME MINISTER:  

 Our position is very clear. We want to give all Australians a say on the matter. That's perfectly  democratic and the obstacle to that is Mr Shorten. He is the one that went to the Australian Christian  Lobby and said he supported a plebiscite, in 2013. So a little over three years ago. He gave that  commitment. And now, of course, for the sake of politics, he would rather have seek a political  advantage, if that's how he perceives it, rather than allow the matter to be decided. It would have been  decided by now. The vote would have been had, would have been carried - 

 JOURNALIST:  

 But on backflips, you back flipped on 18C, you changed your mind on 18C. Don't you agree this is what  politicians do, they change their position?  

 PRIME MINISTER:  

 Again, I don't accept that proposition at all. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 You said five times before the election that you wouldn't change 18C and now you're pushing through  changes? 

 PRIME MINISTER:  

 What we said before the election was that we did not have any plans to change 18C and that was  absolutely true. So again, as a guardian of the truth, you should be more careful with the language you  attribute to me. Any other questions? 

 JOURNALIST:  

 On the US refugee deal, do you agree with the officials in the US who say the deal is loosely contingent  on Australia doing more? 

 PRIME MINISTER:  

 Look, I haven't seen those remarks, but as we've said, we have a very close relationship between  Australia and the United States. They are our most important ally. It is a very close and engaged 

 relationship and we support each other and help each other out in virtually every field, and so we will  always be supporting each other in areas of this kind.  

 Thank you very much.
