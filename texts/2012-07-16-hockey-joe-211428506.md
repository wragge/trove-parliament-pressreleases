 E&OE………………………………………………………………………………………

 JOURNALIST:

 Tell me why you are here in Ballarat today. 

 JOE HOCKEY:

 I am here with Senator Michael Ronaldson in Ballarat to meet with local small businesses, to meet  with the local council, to hear their direct concerns about the carbon tax. We are out meeting with  people, hearing about the impact of the tax. Julia Gillard is going to orchestrated events, she hasn’t  yet been to a business that is directly affected by the carbon tax. Quite frankly that is the difference  between the Labor Party and the Coalition. We are focussed on meeting real people, talking about  the real issues, not trying to skirt over issues. 

 JOURNALIST:

 Are businesses worried?

 JOE HOCKEY:

 Certainly they are. Of course they are. This is a tax that is embedded, whenever the government  engages in spin and obfuscation, then, naturally enough, business losses faith in the word of the  government. So when the government claims there will be no GST applied to the carbon tax,  everyone knows they are telling a fib because at the end of the day the carbon tax is an embedded tax  that increases the price of a good or a service, and, of course, the GST is on top of that. Of course  GST revenues are going to go up and the government is going to collect more tax through the GST  and more tax through the carbon tax. 

 JOURNALIST:

 What are the latest things we are seeing rises on?  

 JOE HOCKEY:

 When it comes to landfill this is yet another example of the carbon tax having a very direct impact  on the cost of everything. The government has been claiming that only a few people are going to  have to pay increased landfill costs, but everyone that uses a tip is going to end up paying increased  costs because of the carbon tax. The government runs away from it, but it can’t hide the impact of its  tax. 

 JOURNALIST:

 What are some of the costs small businesses are facing in particular? 

 JOE HOCKEY:

 Small businesses are going to see significant increases in their electricity prices, but also for any  small business that has refrigerators or freezers, they are going to see a massive increase in the cost  of refrigerants. I met a business last week that is going to see a $19,000 bill for refrigerants increase  to over $100,000 directly as a result of the carbon tax. The government can’t hide the fact that if its  tax is going to raise over $8 billion a year, it is going to have an impact on the community, it will.  

 JOURNALIST:

 When will the Coalition release details of your industrial relations policy? 

 JOE HOCKEY:

 We will release it well before the next election. The next election is scheduled for the 2 half of next  year. If we followed the lead of the Labor Party, we would be releasing our policy in the second half  of next year. Labor has never released an industrial relations policy any further out than about 2 or 3  months from polling day. It is a bit rich for the Labor Party to start calling on us to release our  industrial relations plan when we still haven’t seen the latest version of a report into the Fair Work  Act, which the government itself commissioned some time back.

 JOURNALIST:

 Mr Hockey, you talked about asylum seekers on the radio this morning. What was your last  comment to Mike about sending them back?

 JOE HOCKEY:

 The fact of the matter is the Sri Lankan High Commissioner has now confirmed that a policy of  turning back the boats works. No matter what the government says, our policy of turning back the  boats, where possible, will work. Look at what is happening in Sri Lanka. Look at what has  happened previously. The three point plan of temporary protection visas, offshore processing, and, 

 where possible, turning back the boats, does make a difference. It stops the boats from coming. I just  make one further point, how could anyone reasonably expect Indonesia to be turning back the boats  the same way Sri Lanka is after this government turned off the supply of live cattle exports to the  Indonesians? The Indonesians are perfectly and reasonably angry as all get out about the fact that  this government stopped the supply of live cattle exports to their country. They turned off the food.  So why would Indonesia turn off the boats, if we, previously, under the Gillard government, turned  off the food supply to Indonesia? 

 JOURNALIST:

 Is the UN’s Refugee Convention outdated? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 We didn’t say it was outdated. We stick by our policy of ensuring that if people come by boat they  displace humanitarian refugees that come through the front door. Our policy hasn’t changed.
