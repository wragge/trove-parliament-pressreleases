 ATTORNEY-GENERAL   THE HON PHILIP RUDDOCK MP 

 

 NEWS RELEASE   

 27 October 2003 R011/21003 

 

 MIGRATION LITIGATION REVIEW TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE 

 Attorney-General Philip Ruddock today announced a review of migration litigation  aimed at leading to more efficient management of migration cases. 

 “For some time the Government has been concerned about delays in the resolution of  migration cases and the very low success rate of applicants,” Mr Ruddock said. 

 In 2002-2003, more than one third of migration applications in the Federal Court and  the  Federal  Magistrates  Court  were  withdrawn  by  applicants  before  the  court   reached a decision.  The Government won 92.5 percent of the remaining cases. 

 “These figures suggest that much court time is being wasted at taxpayer expense and  litigants with meritorious claims are being inconvenienced,” Mr Ruddock said. 

 “The Government is committed to applicants with genuine claims having their case  properly  considered,  however  great  strain  is  being  placed  on  the  courts  and  the   migration system more generally, by unmeritorious applications. 

 Migration  cases  form  a  substantial  and  increasing  proportion  of  the  workloads  of   both the Federal Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. 

 Migration applications filed in or transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court went  from  182  in  2001-2002  to  1,397  in  2002-03.   In  the  Federal  Court,  migration  matters   comprised 66.5 percent of appeals last year, up from 56.5 percent the previous year. 

 The  review  will  be  headed  by  First  Parliamentary  Counsel  Ms  Hilary  Penfold   PSM QC. 

 “Ms Penfold has a wealth of experience in advising the Government on solutions to  complex policy problems and she is well placed to tackle these difficult issues,” Mr  Ruddock said. 

 “The  Federal  Court,  Federal  Magistrates  Court  and  Refugee  Review  Tribunal  are   contributing staff to the review.  I welcome the valuable practical contribution they  will make to the review.” 

 A  high  level  steering  committee  will  assist  the  review.   Members  of  the  steering   committee  will  include  a  Federal  Court  judge  and  a  federal  magistrate,  as  well  as

 deputy  secretaries  from  the  Attorney-General’s  Department,  the  Department  of   Prime  Minister  and  Cabinet  and  the  Department  of  Immigration  and  Multicultural   and Indigenous Affairs. 

 The review is to report by the end of this year.

 b) the adequacy of the existing framework for ensuring that migration agents and  members of the legal profession do not encourage the bringing of unmeritorious  migration cases; 

 c) the effect that non-compliance with specific provisions of the Migration Act 1958  should have on review rights; and 

 d) any other matter that the review considers is relevant to the more efficient  management and disposition of claims relating to migration status.
