 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling Over 37,000 arrivals under Labor’s failed  border protection policies April 14, 2013

 Another five boats carrying a combined total of nearly 300 passengers, brings the total to well over 37,000 arrivals since  Labor abolished the proven border protection policies of the Howard Government, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs  and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “The serious consequences of this Government’s inability to protect our borders has again been highlighted in the past  two weeks when 21 boats carrying 1397 passengers have been successfully smuggled to Australia,” Mr Keenan said.

 “We have watched the farce that is Labor’s border protection policies reach new lows this week when two men in a dingy  intercepted an asylum seeker vessel near Geraldton whilst another vessel made it all the way into theport at Christmas  Island before being detected.

 “At this point last year there had been 25 illegal boat arrivals, this year there has already been more than three times this  amount, despite 2012 seeing the greatest number of boat arrivals ever.

 “This is not an encouraging indication of what 2013 will bring under this Labor Government’s border protection crisis.

 “Julia Gillard promised to smash the people smugglers’ business model at the 2010 election, yet since then she has  presided over the complete breakdown of Australia’s border protection system.

 “The people smugglers know this Government is a soft touch when it comes to stopping this insidious trade and only a  change of government will provide the tough policies needed to restore the robust system that stopped the boats from  coming,” Mr Keenan said.
