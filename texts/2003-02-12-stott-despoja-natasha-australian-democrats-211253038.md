 Foreign Affairs White Paper: Advancing What?     

 The “national interest” advanced by the Howard Government in the Foreign Affairs and Trade  White Paper is often inconsistent and hinges heavily on America’s national interest, according to  the Australian Democrats.      

 Democrats’ Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, said that like the foreign  policies adopted by the Government in recent months, the paper has a number of inconsistencies.    

 “The White Paper describes Australia as ‘outward-looking’ and as ‘a welcoming nation’, which is  ironic coming from a Government elected on a ‘Protecting Australia’s Borders’ platform,” said  Senator Stott Despoja.     

 “Although the Paper refers to the global challenge posed by 12 million refugees requiring asylum  across the world, it says nothing about Australia’s role or responsibility in addressing this challenge  and assisting these people.       

 “Australia’s commitment to the United Nations and other multi-lateral organisations is emphasised  throughout.  However, this commitment is rendered hollow by the clear indication that multi-lateral  frameworks will be abandoned when they fail to adopt Australia’s preferred course.    

 “The Government’s refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol because of the alleged implications for  Australian industry, illustrates this approach,” said Senator Stott Despoja.      

 “When it comes to security issues, it is clear that Australia is likely to participate in a coalition of  ‘those willing to act in the common interest’ regardless of the actions of the United Nations.   

 “This document illustrates the Government has a clear commitment to military strategies and  security.  What the Democrats want to see is an equivalent commitment to human rights,  environmental protection and foreign aid.   

 “That is in our national and global interest,” concluded Senator Stott Despoja.
