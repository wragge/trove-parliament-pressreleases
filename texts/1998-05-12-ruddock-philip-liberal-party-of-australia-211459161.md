  MINISTER THANKS OUTGOING RRT PRINCIPAL MEMBER

  

  The Minist er for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip 
Ruddock has paid tribute to Mr Shun Chetty, who has resigned as Principal 
Member of the Refugee Review Tribunal.

  

 “Mr Chetty who has had a distinguished international 
career in the field of refugee and human rights, has decided to return 
to South Africa,” Mr Ruddock said.

  

 “He was appointed to the position of Principal Member 
of the Tribunal in 1995 and has served with a high level of dedication 
in an area of administrative law that has posed many challenges over 
many years.”

  

 Mr Chetty came to Australia after working with the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in a number of posts around 
the world. He was a lawyer in South Africa in the mid to late 70s, representing 
opponents of the apartheid regime.

  

 “I would like to thank Mr Chetty for his efforts 
and for bringing his experience and knowledge to Australia during his 
time as Principal Member,” Mr Ruddock said.

  

 “His resignation has been accepted with reluctance 
and I wish he and his family well on their return to South Africa.”

  

 Mr John Godfrey will act in the position of Principal 
Member until a new appointment is made.

  

 Mr Godfrey has served at a senior level in the Department 
of Foreign Affairs and was Counsellor - Immigration at the Australian 
Permanent Mission in Geneva, working closely with the UNHCR. He is presently 
a full-time Member on the RRT.
