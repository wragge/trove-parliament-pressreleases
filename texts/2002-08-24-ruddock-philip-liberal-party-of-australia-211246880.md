 GOVERNMENT AIMS TO HELP REFUGEES AT GREATEST RISK

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock has  urged  all  Australians  to  use  Refugee  Sunday  to  welcome  refugees  and acknowledge the contribution refugees have made to Australia.

 “We should be proud of our nation’s efforts to help those most in need,” the Minister said.

 “Australia’s stance on illegal migration means Australia could now help more people in urgent humanitarian need around the world.

 “We  have  an  enviable  record  of  achievement  most  notable  in  the  post  World  War Two  period  including  the  Indochinese  Refugee  crisis  and  our  recent  assistance  to displaced Kosovars and East Timorese.

 “More recently, in the past year under Australia’s refugee and humanitarian program, 12,349 people were given visas for Australia.

 “Australia  is  one  of  only  10  or  so  countries  in  the  world  that  operates  a  dedicated offshore  resettlement  program  which  seeks  out  the  world’s  most  needy  and desperate refugees and people in humanitarian need.

 “Our desire to ensure the integrity of Australia’s borders and the right to decide who should  and  should  not  enter  Australia  is  part  of  our  commitment  to  providing humanitarian assistance for those most at risk.

 “The success of recent policies and actions have resulted in no boat arrivals in about nine  months,  meaning  we  can  now  increase  our  focus  on  helping  people  from refugee situations around the world, for example in Africa.

 “I  have  also  told  the  UNHCR  that  Australia  is  prepared  to  settle  300  refugees  from the camps in Tanzania.

 “Because  of  the  success  of  our  border  management  policies  more  offshore resettlement places are available so more people, who don’t have the money to pay a people smuggler for a new identity and fabricated story of persecution will be able to come to Australia.”

 “Australia’s  offshore  Humanitarian  Program  targets  refugees  and  people  in humanitarian  need  who  cannot  go  home  and  who  cannot  be  integrated  in  their country of first asylum - refugees often with no resources to hire a people smuggler and whose desperate voices are the first ignored in much of the public debate.

 The Minister said globally, resettlement places were limited - only about 110,000 per year are available in a handful of resettlement countries.

  “Governments and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees must decide who gets a resettlement place. This cannot be a self-selection exercise, nor can it be left to people smugglers to decide.

 “Only  by  retaining  control  of  the  system  of  international  protection,  including determining  which  refugees  are  in  need  of  resettlement,  can  the  international community  ensure  that  the  finite  collective  resources  of  governments  are  allocated effectively and efficiently.”
