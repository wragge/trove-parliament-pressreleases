 MEDIA RELEASE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER FA142            15  October  2004  

 

 DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT: AMBASSADOR TO EGYPT   

 I  have  today  announced  the  appointment  of  Dr  Bob  Bowker  as  Australian  Ambassador  to   Egypt, with concurrent accreditation to Libya (until our post opens there in 2005) and Tunisia.  Dr Bowker will replace Mr Robert Newton who has been Ambassador since January 2002. Dr  Bowker is expected to take up his appointment in January 2005.   

 Australia values its warm relationship with Egypt. Australia recognises Egypt’s central role in  regional  political  developments  and  attaches  importance  to  dialogue  with  Egypt  on  current   and emerging challenges in the Middle East and internationally. Australia has a long-standing  commitment to helping further peace efforts in the region and, in support of this, is continuing  to provide military personnel to the Multinational Force and Observers located in the Sinai.   Australia  values  cooperation  with  Egypt  on  a  range  of  multilateral  issues  including  WTO   matters, arms control and disarmament. 

 Two-way trade between Australia and Egypt amounted to $614 million in 2003-4.  Egypt is a  substantial  buyer  of  Australian  wheat  and  is  an  important  market  for  a  range  of  other   Australian  exports  including  live  cattle,  faba  beans,  dairy  products  and  a  range  of   manufactured goods. 

 Dr  Bowker  is  a  specialist  on  Middle  East  and  Islamic  issues.  He  joined  the  then-Australian   Department of External Affairs, now the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), in  1971.   Dr  Bowker  has  had  a  number  of  overseas  postings,  including  two  postings  to  Kuala   Lumpur   (1971-1973 and 1982-1985); Jeddah (1974-1976);  and  Damascus  (1979  to  1981).    He  was  Australian  Ambassador  to  Jordan  from  1989-1992  and  accredited  at  that  time  to   Tunisia.    

 From  1994-1995  Dr  Bowker  was  the  DFAT  research  scholar  at  the  Australian  National   University’s  Centre  for  Middle  East  and  Central  Asian  Studies.   In  1997-1998  he  was   Director, External Relations and Public Information and subsequently Senior Adviser, Policy  Research of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near  East (UNRWA) in Gaza and Jerusalem.  From 2001-2003 he was seconded from DFAT to the  Directing  Staff  of  the  Centre  for  Defence  and  Strategic  Studies  at  the  Australian  Defence   College, Canberra.   

 In  Canberra,  Dr  Bowker  has  been  the  Director  of  the  Middle  East  Section  of  DFAT  three   times, most recently in 1999-2000.  Currently on leave from DFAT, Dr Bowker is the Visiting  Reader (Associate Professor) in the Centre for Arab and Islamic Studies, the Middle East and  Central Asia, at the Australian National University teaching graduate courses on the dynamics  of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Persian Gulf security.    

 Dr  Bowker  graduated  from  the  University  of  Melbourne  in  1970  with  a  Bachelor  of  Arts   degree  with  Honours  in  Indonesian  and  Malayan  Studies.   He  has  a  Master  of  Arts  degree   from  the  Australian  National  University  (1995)  and  a  Doctor  of  Philosophy,  also  from  the   Australian National University (2001).  He is married with four adult children.
