 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA                               MONDAY 16 JANUARY 2006 

 SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT  AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS DEPUTY LEADER 

 GENUINE REFUGEE STILL IN DETENTION AFTER 6 YEARS  Australian Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson, Andrew Bartlett, has called on the Minister for  Immigration to immediately allow one of Australia’s longest serving detainees, Mr Niqib Amad Noori,  out of detention so that he can be reunited with his Australian family while his security clearance is  finalised.  

 “Last Saturday marked three months since the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) overturned  previous wrong decisions and found that Mr Noori qualified for refugee status, yet he is still  languishing in detention,” Senator Bartlett said. 

 “This three month delay comes on top of Mr Noori being detained in Australia for six years on the  basis of wrong information and mistaken identity.  He has been separated from his family, including  three young children, who were granted protection visas in August 2000 and who are all now  Australian citizens.” 

 “It is bad enough that his children have grown up without him while he was unnecessarily locked up  for six years, but to keep him detained even after a successful AAT decision is simply wrong.” 

 “One has to ask why security assessments are not done until after everything else is finalised, even  when there has been six years to do it.  However, if a formal visa can not lawfully be granted until the  security assessment is complete, at least the Minister could allow him into the community under a  detention order in the same way as she has done for other long-term detainees.” Senator Bartlett  concluded.
