 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Friday, 29 November 2013    

 Humanitarian crisis looms, Morrison builds a  prison    

 Immigration Minister Scott Morrison’s confirmation that a maximum security prison will be built on  Manus Island is a gross waste of money that would be better spent on dealing with the fallout form  Indonesia’s decision to close its detention centres, the Australian Greens have said.    

 “When Indonesia closes its detention centres thousands of people will have nowhere to go and  more will be forced onto boats,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “Australia should lead a genuine regional solution that would lift the pressure off of Indonesia and  give refugees a safe way to reach protection.    

 “An emergency refugee intake out of Indonesia and Malaysia, while encouraging other countries to  do the same, would mirror Australia’s successful humanitarian response to the end of the Vietnam  War.    

 “Australia’s stubborn refusal to approach the current situation as the humanitarian crisis that it is  has taken an incredible toll that is continuing to mount.    

 “The cost of offshore processing was already tipped to blow out over a billion dollars this year and  Scott Morrison’s response is to build a prison on a remote Pacific Island.    

 “The true cost of cruelty is measured in damage to vulnerable children and lives lost when people  were not given protection, but the increasing bill in dollars and cents is also staggering.   

 “Operation Secret Boats is nothing more than a media strategy designed to keep as much  information as possible away from the Australian people.”
