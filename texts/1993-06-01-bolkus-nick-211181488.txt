 CAMBODIAN BOAT PEOPLE

 On Tuesday, Mr Justice Wilcox handed down his decision in the Lek case, in which he ruled that the refusal by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs of the claim by the principal applicant for refugee status was lawful and involved no reviewable error. He also decided there were no errors of law in the determinations relating to issues common to all 48 claimants covered by the case.

 The applicants had their claims carefully and exhaustively tested, firstly at the initial and primary decision stage and later in review, and were found not to be refugees.

 In effect, his Honour vindicated the refugee determination process in this case.

 The Government welcomes this decision, particularly its upholding of the decisions of departmental officers in this case, in light of some of the criticisms directed at the Department.

 His Honour's judgement also left it open to me to consider whether to exercise my power under sub-section 115(5) of the Migration Act 1958 to intervene in these applicants' cases.

 As his Honour noted, I have no duty to do so.

 I have written today to the applicants' lawyers, informing them that I do not propose to consider whether or not to exercise this discretion.
