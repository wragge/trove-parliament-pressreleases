 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA  5 SEPTEMBER 2003   

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects: INQUIRY INTO PHILIP RUDDOCK’S USE OF  MINISTERIAL DISCRETION (2)   

 

 ROXON: Well it’s day one of the Senate hearings today into Minister  Ruddock’s use of his powers to intervene in granting visas. What’s been  extraordinary in the revelations today is that even in day one, Labor has had  confirmed some of our most serious suspicions about the way the migration  system is running in Australia.   

 What we’ve found out is if you are a friend of Mr Ruddock’s, like Mr Kisrwani,  your success rate of getting a visa granted is about 50%.   

 If you are a Member of Parliament, or even more staggeringly, the Refugee  Review Tribunal, your success rate is only around 18% or lower.   

 We’re very concerned that what this shows is that there is favouritism built into  the system, and more figures will come out and more enquiries obviously need  to be made through the Senate Committee, but we think it’s quite damning  evidence that’s come out today that the system is just not working in the way  that it should be.   

 JOURNALIST:   What needs to be done now?   

 ROXON: Well I think what we need to do is make sure that we get all  of the material that is going to be provided by the Department.  There is a lot of  information that hasn’t been given to us today, but the early information that  has been provided has been quite damning, so we obviously need to see what’s  going to happen with the rest of the inquiry.   

 JOURNALIST:   Couldn’t it be that Mr Kisrwani is simply representing people  that are more likely to meet the criteria?   

 

 

 ROXON:  What’s  interesting  about the evidence today is that the Refugee Review  Tribunal - the Government’s own experts - grant visas, but often when they refuse them they  will then make a recommendation to the Minister that he intervene, because for some technical  reason they don’t fit within their guidelines.   I think it’s fair enough to expect that they would  be good at assessing some of the strongest, compassionate humanitarian cases.  There’s no  reason to believe that a travel agent in Harris Park has any particular inside information in  making those assessments.   

 JOURNALIST:   The Departmental Deputy Secretary said that she felt that the current system  worked well in enabling the Minister to handle discretionary decisions and that it was too  difficult to prescribe within the Act.  Do you agree with that?   

 ROXON: Well I think that are probably a small number of cases where it is important  to retain Ministerial Discretion if they don’t fit within the guidelines for some reason, but  2000 cases since this Minister has been in power, 2000 cases is a large part of our migration  program to be done without any sort of accountability.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you think something, like a separate inquiry, needs to be conducted into  why somebody like Mr Kisrwani has so much influence?   

 ROXON: Well I think that those issues need to be explored within this inquiry.  Other  information that’s been given to the inquiry today show that Mr Kisrwani is in the top 10 of  community representatives that do actually make requests to the Minister.  He’s the only person  on that top 10 list who doesn’t work in the migration field in one way or another and we do  want to know why he’s there and why he has such a good record.
