 Breakfast Function Christian Business Network 

 Victoria Point, Brisbane, Qld - 22 August 2005

 I am very happy to be with you all. I come down here a lot, not only because I like this  area, but also because you have a great Federal Member who is destined for greater  things in the Australian Government in the years ahead. Andrew is one of the people who  put this part of the world on the map in Queensland. He is lucky to live in such a great  place.  

 You have to excuse my deeper than normal voice. I have been in Canberra for the past  week and, naturally enough, with minus three degree temperatures - A: you get colds and  B: you realise why we live in Queensland. 

 It is good to be with you all at this inaugural business meeting in this southern part of the  electorate. Just hearing what you all do I can say 'boy, have we got something for you all'. 

 As business people, most of you will appreciate the improvement in business conditions  since John Howard became Prime Minister way back in 1996. We have set out to do  everything we can to nurture business, particularly small business - for a number of  reasons. Small businesses are those who spend their money and their all in advancing  themselves and, in so doing, advancing their area, and indeed Australia and also small  business creates employment and I think the employment figures demonstrate how 

 important it is to help small business, because small business will then help with  employment. We are very proud over the years, in the time we have been in government,  to see a very gradual reduction in unemployment. 

 For those of you who are in real estate you will remember, as I do, when we were paying  something like 18 per cent on housing loans and some of my clients in business were  spending something like 26 per cent or 27 per cent - how I ever afforded a home paying  18 per cent I don't know, I am not quite sure I could do it now. But, obviously, with our 

 Government paying off something like $90 billion on Government debt racked up by the  previous lot - we created an environment where interest rates can come down. 

 Sure they bounce around, but they bounce around between 5-7 per cent rather than  between 12-20 per cent as they used to under the previous government. Of course,  inflation is a very important part of that as well. 

 So, I think people like yourselves, would have an interest in good government and good  economic management. 

 There was one person here from the community health area and boy have we got  something for her. You only have to look at the way the State Government has managed  health in Queensland to understand that we really do need a change in government at  State level andg certainly the two by-election victories on the weekend do demonstrate, I 

 think, that most Queenslanders share that view that something needs to be done with the  health system in Queensland and it won't be done by 'Smiling Pete' coming out with the  same old assurances, never doing anything except for employing a few more pen pushers,  as they say, to try and fix the health system.

 So, we are very keen on having a good economy Australia-wide and, I think, to a fair  degree, we have achieved that. One of the things that we need to do to complete the  reforms that have been needed in Australia, is to fix the industrial relations system and, as 

 you know, we are well into that at the present time. Now I hope you are not fooled as  many Australians I have to say are, by this quite dishonest campaign being run by the  union movement and the State Labor governments, I might say, using your taxpayer's 

 money on what the industrial relations legislation might have. For a start, the legislation  hasn't been drafted, and while we have spoken in broad terms about what we want to do,  the actual specifics that you are reading about in the Labor ads are purely figments of  their imaginations. 

 We obviously take into account all aspects of Australian society - while we are very pro-business we also want fairness for workers and the industrial relations legislation will do  that. What we are committed to though, is getting rid of that so-called unfair dismissal  legislation which has been inhibiting small businesses employing people for a long, long  time. We are going to get rid of that for smaller-medium sized businesses, and that is one  of the reforms that I think was badly needed in this country. 

 If we picked up the economy - and we do that by helping business, and by helping  employment by keeping interest rates down, we can of course divert increasing amounts  of money to our health systems, to our education system and to good infrastructure  around the country. 

 As you know, the last issue in Parliament was, for all the wrong reasons, focused on the  sale of Telstra. We have won two elections on the basis of our policy to sell Telstra - there  has never been any doubt about that. It was going to be sold and there was never any  doubt that in selling Telstra we would be using part of the expected $30 billion to $40  billion from the sale of Telstra to ensure that the telecommunications infrastructure right  around Australia, not just in the bush, but in suburban areas and in inner-city blackspots  would be fixed up. That was always the intention, and that intention is getting some  greater focus at the moment with the announcements made during the week.  

 The other thing the Howard Government has been very keen on as a national government  is border security. We have a great country here and we want to make sure we stay that  way. But, of course, our border security in this broad sense means that we have to do  what we can to fight against terrorism wherever it occurs in the world, because terrorism  wherever it is will have an impact on Australia, as Bali has shown.  

 We wanted to make sure in our immigration area that those people who come to Australia  were people that stood in line and fitted the criteria that we had. Our refugee policy is one  of the most generous in the world and it is there for everyone to see. We didn't want  illegal people trying to jump the queue and we stopped that trend through strong law  enforcement.  

 We have made a lot of alliances, not only with the United States, and reinvigorated our  alliances with the United Kingdom and Europe, but, of course, we have become the most  'Asian government' or 'pro-Asian government' that Australia has seen, and our  involvement in a lot of bilateral and multilateral arrangements with our Asian neighbours is certainly something we are very proud of.  

 We have advanced a series of free trade agreements - the United States is done, Thailand  is done and Singapore is done. We have a CER with New Zealand and, of course, we are  investigating - 'investigating' I emphasise, a free trade agreement with China. We have  put huge investments into defence equipment and, of course, if we wanted to defend  Australia with our small population we have to make sure that we are at the cutting edge  of defence equipment, and we have spent a lot of money on that and we have gone out of  our way to protect Australia's assets.

 Ladies and gentlemen, I might just briefly move on to my own portfolio with Fisheries,  Forestry and Conservation. In the fisheries area, one of the big things I do is protect  Australia's fisheries from international criminals. Down in the Southern Ocean, around our  territories of Heard and McDonald Islands, we have a very valuable fishery in the rare  Patagonian toothfish.  

 If you harvest Patagonian toothfish sustainably it will be there forever. It demands an  enormous price in Japan and North America and we have very good fishing grounds  around our territories of Heard and McDonald Islands.  

 But pirates, particularly from Spain, although flagged to 'flags of convenience nations'  right around the world, were coming into our waters and illegally harvesting the  Patagonian toothfish. We have made a couple of high profile arrests - one of them you  might recall was the Viarsa which we chased across three oceans and caught with the help  of the South Africans and the Brits just as it was 200 or 300 kilometres off Montevideo  Uruguay, but it demonstrated Australia's commitment.  

 Since then we have paid $90 million for two years to get an Australian gun boat down  there in the Southern Ocean to protect our borders and our Patagonian toothfish. As a  result, our intelligence is now showing, and our on the water patrols are confirming that 

 illegal fishing of Patagonian toothfish around Heard and McDonald Islands has just about  finished. 

 We are very proud of that. We enjoy a very close working relationship with France, which  has an adjoining island territory and, together, we really have chased the pirates away,  and that is great news for Australia and good for the fish stock, good for our fishers, but  also good for our border security. It demonstrates that, no matter where we are in  Australia, we are keeping our borders secure. 

 Up in the north we have a big problem with Indonesian fishers coming across stealing our  fish. Their fisheries are just about finished through bad management over many years so  they are coming closer and closer to our waters. Shark fin is selling in Asia at the moment 

 for $750 a kilo, and that is a very great incentive for Indonesian village fishers to come in  and get the sharks, and kill the sharks in a very cruel way and, of course, sell their fins.  

 Recently, though, we have noticed that there is more of the international criminal element  particularly up north, and boats now are not just village fishing boats, they are boats that  have good equipment and good navigation equipment on board. The last one we caught  just last week was a 40-metre trawler flagged to Indonesia that contained a crew of 23  Thais and it sent most of its catch to Thailand.  

 Our investigations are continuing, but we suspect that it is part of an international criminal  cartel. We are determined to protect from illegal fishing Australia and the north. There are  a lot of resources going into that sort of thing. 

 We import more than 50 per cent of the fish we eat. Fortunately, most of the fish we catch  in Australia is very high quality, premium stuff which demands very high prices in Japan  and North America - the southern blue fin tuna, the rock lobster, the abalone and our  prawns.  

 So, to feed the Australian market, we have to import a lot of fish. We are very concerned  about a few unscrupulous retailers who are labelling imported fish as 'Australian', so we  recently embarked upon a campaign, something we promised to do in the election, to  ensure mandatory labelling and accurate labelling.  

 So, when you go down to the fish markets, or to Woolies or Coles, you will notice now  which fish is imported and which is Australian. The Australian fish will be a little bit more

 expensive, but I think most people will take the Australian fish because they know it  comes from the cleanest seas in the world and, the important thing, is that it is properly  labelled.  

 We have just launched our 1800 number - if you think some retailer is selling imported  fish that is labelled Australian there is a 1800 number - 1800 737 147 - and you ring that  number and we will get the authorities out to investigate. 

 One other thing, ladies and gentlemen, being in this lovely part of the world where I know  recreational fishing is very important. Before the election, with Andrew Laming, I  announced just out on the water not far from here, our $15 million recreational fishing  policy, where we said we would put money into grants to fishing clubs, to individuals, to  any groups that might have an idea to make the recreational fishing experience even  better, and that is something that Andrew had a bit of an input into - actually, quite a  substantial input into that policy.  

 We won the election, we have allocated the money in the last Budget and, just last  weekend, down this way, I was able to actually launch that Programme. So, if any of you  are fishers, or involved in any fishing clubs or anything, there is $15 million up for grabs if  you have a good idea of how to enhance the recreational fishing experience.  

 Perhaps a new ramp, perhaps a fish cleaning table - whatever you can think of. 

 So that is that, and I have almost run out of time. But can I just briefly mention timber?  Because I hear one of the people here has an interest in forests. The timber industry in  Australia - the wood and wood product industry - is our fourth biggest manufacturing  industry. It employs over 130,000 people Australia-wide and is the most sustainable 

 forestry industry anywhere in the world. It is a renewable resource and, in Australia, we  manage it better than, or as good as, any other country in the world. I am always  concerned that the radical Green movement is always trying to shut down the Australian  timber industry - it is a real concern for me.  

 Because what that means is, instead of getting our timber and wood products from the  world's most sustainable forestry operations, we will still use timber and wood products  and paper, so instead of getting it from Australia's well managed forests we will be 

 importing it from places from Indonesia, the Solomons and New Guinea where criminals  are illegally harvesting, and certainly unsustainably harvesting, fairly rare tropical species,  destroying local economies and doing all the wrong things by the forests.  

 So, that is why I am determined to promote Australian forestry because it is well managed  and sustainable and it stops us importing illegal stuff from Indonesia. Again, one of the  things we promised to do in the last election, and which we are looking at now, is working  out a scheme to identify the source of imported timber so we can try and ensure that the  timber imported into Australia does come from sustainable sources. 

 Ladies and gentlemen, I have run out of time, but I just want to tell you a couple of other  things - in my conservation area, probably things that you people, particularly in the city  or suburban areas don't think about often. One of the things I am involved in is weeds.  People think - 'weeds' - that is a pretty silly sort of a thing for a Federal Minister to be  involved in. But, can I tell you that weeds in Australia cost this country something like $4  billion every year?  

 Now, $2.5 billion in lost production on productive farming lands, and about $1.5 billion in  on ground control by landowners, the local, State and Australian Governments. That is a  major problem weeds like rubber vine, parthenium, lantana and parkinsonian. There are  20 Weeds of National Significance we have identified. There are about 7,000 weeds in  Australia at the moment.

 Regretfully, some of them you will buy when you go down to the local nursery. Most of our  weeds have come from nurseries, or imported in other commodities, and are a major  problem for Australia. They are part of the border protection campaign that we have to  promote to protect quarantine. This year, in the last election, the Government promised  $40 million extra on top of the $27 million we are already spending in attempting to  Defeat the Weed Menace.  

 Weeds are principally a matter, under the Constitution, for State Governments, who give  authority to local governments and landowners, and we have been distressed that  Commonwealth land has (inaudible) the State is not seriously addressing weeds so we  have embarked upon a major programme to help coordinate responses around Australia. 

 So, Andrew they are just a few of the things that are happening. There are a million other  things, of course, that you perhaps might be interested in, and I would be happy to try  and answer any questions you might have. But it is good to see you all, it is good to be  down in this part of the world again and it is good to be doing anything I can to support a  guy who as I say has an enormous future in the Government of Australia. 

 Thanks very much.
