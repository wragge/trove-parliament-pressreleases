 MALARIA AS A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM DEPENDS UPON INTERNATIONAL  

 COOPERATION AND COORDINATION, AND THE SHARING OF EXPERIENCES,

 KNOWLEDGE AND RESOURCES. THE INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES PLAY AN  

 ESSENTIAL ROLE IN T H IS  REGARD, PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO  

 COORDINATION, TO THE DISSEMINATION OF CURRENT AND NEW KNOWLEDGE,

 AND IN THE SUPPORT OF RESEARCH AND TR AINING.

 Co o p e r a t i o n , h o w ever ,  s ee m s to be e q u a l l y  d e p e n d e n t

 ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO COOPERATE TO MEET AND  

 DISCUSS THEIR RESPECTIVE SITUATIONS. .

 Wi t h  b o t h a s p e c t s  -  c o o r d i n a t i o n  and c o o p e r a t i o n

 DESIGNED INTO THE STRUCTURE OF THIS MEETING, I AM SURE I T  WILL ·

 BE A VALUABLE EXPERIENCE FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS.

 Among t h e f i v e  n a t i o n s  r e p r e s e n t e d  a t t h e m e e t i n g ,

 Au s t r a l i a  has b e e n f o r t u n a t e  to have b e e n a b l e to e r a d i c a t e  e n d e m i c

 MALARIA OVER TWO DECADES AGO. I AM INFORMED THAT T H IS  WAS ALMOST  

 ACCIDENTAL AT THE T IM E , GREATLY AIDED BY THE PROLONGED DRY SEASONS  

 IN NORTH AUSTRALIA AND THE SMALL AND SCATTERED HUMAN POPULATIONS IN THE  

 RECEPTIVE AREA. AUSTRALIA WAS CE RTIFIED BY W . H . O . ,  IN 1981, AS 

 HAVING ERADICATED MALARIA. TODAY, THE NORTH OF AUSTRALIA REMAINS  

 RECEPTIVE, BUT THE NORTHERN POPULATION IS INCREASING WITH DEVELOPMENT,  

 AND SO IS THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL MALARIA CARRIERS ENTERING THE  

 RECEPTIVE AREA FROM OVERSEAS -  AS TRAVELLERS, REFUGEES, OR IN  

 ASSOCIATION WITH INDUSTRIES SUCH AS MINING AND F IS H IN G .

 MORE LATER. TH IS  F IE L D  STATION IS BEING ESTABLISHED NOT ONLY  

 TO ASSIST WITH MALARIA SURVEILLANCE IN T H IS  PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE  

 AREA, BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE A TRAINING F A C IL IT Y  IN MAINTENANCE PHASE  

 AND OTHER MALARIA-RELATED A C T I V I T I E S .  I HOPE THAT VERY SOON WE WILL  

 BE ABLE TO OFFER SPECIFIC COURSES OF TRAINING RELEVANT BOTH TO OUR  

 OWN NEEDS AND FOR THOSE OF OUR NORTHERN NEIGHBOURS. I BELIEVE THIS ...  

 MEETING CAN BE OF GREAT ASSISTANCE IN SPECIFYING THOSE NEEDS AND THUS  

 HELPING IN THE FORMULATION OF APPROPRIATE TRAINING COURSES.

 I WISH YOU WELL WITH YOUR DISCUSSION OVER THE NEXT FOUR  

 DAYS, AND LOOK FORWARD TO READING THE REPORT OF YOUR DELIBERATIONS  

 IN DUE COURSE.
