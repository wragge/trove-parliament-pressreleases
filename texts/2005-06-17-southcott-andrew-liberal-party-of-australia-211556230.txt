 Press Release 

 

 Minister launches refugee kit at Bellevue Heights  Primary School   

 Students and staff at Bellevue Heights Primary School today (17  June) hosted the launch of a new national schools resource kit on  refugees.   

 I was pleased to join the Federal Minister for Immigration and  Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, at the launch of  A New Life for Refugees.   

 The kit confirms that the Australian Government is this year expected to  resettle about 13,000 refugees and humanitarian entrants.   

 It also points out that Australia is one of the top three countries in the  world that accepts people in need of humanitarian resettlement.   

 The kit, which is being sent to primary schools across Australia, explains  that Australia chooses refugees largely on the advice of the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.   

 The UNHCR is quoted stating that Australia is “one of the leading  countries in the resettlement of refugees from Africa” and that “Australia  has developed excellent services for resettled refugees over the past five  decades”.   

 Bellevue Heights Primary School was selected for the launch largely  because of its support for overseas students, including refugees.   

 The school is one of five in Adelaide to offer the New Arrivals program  which is a dedicated program for students arriving in Australia from other  countries.   

 The program offers smaller class sizes and specialist resources for the  107 students currently taking part in the scheme at the school.  This  includes about 30 students from refugee families.   

 I congratulate school Principal, Michael Papps and his staff for providing  an excellent service for our culturally rich community and highly  recommend the schools kit.
