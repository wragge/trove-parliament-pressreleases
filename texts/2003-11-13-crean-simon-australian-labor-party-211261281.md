 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION   

 SPEECH BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON SIMON CREAN MP 

 

 ADDRESS TO THE MONASH MENZIES PUBLIC POLICY SEMINAR 

 INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY: 

 AUSTRALIA’S ROLE IN OUR REGION 

 

 LONDON, 13 NOVEMBER 2003 

 

 During the recent visit to Australia by President George W. Bush I reminded  our two countries that in December 1941 Australia looked to America to help  save us from invasion.   

 But Australians will never forget that in that war we fought alongside Britain -  for six hard years - to defeat fascism, Nazism and then Japanese imperialism.   

 We entered that war to defend a mother country, but we finished it to  construct a new peace based on international law and collective security  through the United Nations and to pursue peaceful and democratic  decolonisation in the former colonies of Asia.   

 On Tuesday, we dedicated a new ANZAC memorial in Hyde Park to remember  what the sacrifice of many thousands of young lives in that war, and other  wars, was for.   

 We must continue to secure the things the ANZACs fought for but we mustn’t  try to return to the times they fought for.   

 The past can be a comforting place.  We can draw strength from its lessons,  the alliances and the institutions it creates.  But we can’t live in it.   

 The world has changed too much.

 The three pillars - not one - needed to secure Australia’s future are: the  multilateral system, the US Alliance and engagement with our region.   

 First, Australia must re-engage in the multilateral system.    

 As a foundation member of the UN, and a middle power, we have a vested  interest in a world where international norms of behaviour are respected and  upheld.    

 Global problems - from trade liberalisation, asylum seekers to terrorism -  require global solutions.    

 To the extent that multilateral systems need reform, Australia must be in the  vanguard of constructive change, not a critic on the sideline.   

 Second, the strength of our alliance with the United States since the  Second World War dispels the myth that Australia must somehow  choose between its geography and its history.    

 This shibboleth has been allowed to persist for too long.    

 Australia must engage with the Asian region as Australians, drawing on our  shared history and strong relations with the United States and the United  Kingdom.   

 Australian foreign policy is sophisticated and mature. We can pursue relations  with Europe, North America and Asia simultaneously. To suggest otherwise is  misguided.   

 Our alliance with the United States is a fundamental pillar of our foreign  policy. But it is not the only pillar.    

 As I said in recent discussions with President Bush, good friends can disagree.     

 With goodwill even the differences can make our relationship stronger.   

 Third, Australian foreign policy must re-engage with our region.    

 Just as today’s Britain increasingly looks to Europe for its future, Australia  looks to Asia.   

 The truth is that Australia must ultimately find security in Asia, not from Asia.  This is what the Australian people expect.    

 As a country of 20 million in a region of over 3 billion, for us the logic of  regional engagement is inescapable.    

 And we must engage as equal partners - confident in our place in the world.  

  3

 

 Importantly, too: just as the UK plays an important bridging role between the  United States and Europe, Australia - it seems to me - is well placed to play a  bridging role between Asia, the United States and the UK.   

 When it comes to building international security and economic development,  we all look to each other.   

 A greater sharing of the burden between our nations - just as we do on  intelligence matters - will only enhance the capacity of each of us to respond  effectively within our spheres of influence. 

 

 For Australia this means building strong relations with Europe, the United  States and Asia.   

 We don’t have to choose.   

 The dichotomy between our history of cultural and kinship ties and our  geographical place in Asia is a false one.    

 Our real choice is not between our history and our geography but between  the past and a safer, more prosperous future.   

 Ties with Britain and the United States are strong - as they always will be -  but if we are to be frank, we must admit that ties to our region need to be  strengthened.   

 As we set out to strengthen ties to Asia, we have first to acknowledge that  our region is changing.     

 Three dynamics have to be acknowledged.   

 â¢ Asian countries are establishing new multilateral regional structures,  from which Australia has been largely excluded.   

 â¢ They are having to cope with new tensions between radical and  moderate Islam.   

 â¢ And they want a new emphasis on multilateral trade and security  arrangements, including a stronger and reformed United Nations.   

 We must set ourselves three objectives to achieve our goal of closer  engagement with the countries of our region.   

 Our first objective must be to put Australia at the heart of the new  East Asian regional institutions.   

  4

 Our region is undergoing dynamic change in its economic and security  arrangements, and Australia is being excluded.   

 China and Japan have outlined new co-operative visions with ASEAN for  developing Asia.   

 Seven out of ten of our major trading partners will potentially be in this  grouping.     

 Australia must be involved.  Failure to do so will cost Australia dearly in jobs,  living standards and security.   

 Headline deals like the ones with China and Thailand on their own are not  enough.   

 Our political stocks have been downgraded, symbolised by the recent denial  of membership of the ASEAN Leadership Group.  They must be improved.   

 Our second objective must be to assist neighbouring moderate  Islamic governments to defeat extremism and terrorism, especially in  Indonesia, but also in Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore.    

 Education is one of the keys to success.   

 We must better educate the leaders of the future - both in Australia and our  region.     

 This can be achieved by promoting in Australia greater knowledge of Asian  languages, culture and belief and by assisting parents in our region to find an  alternative to that offered by fundamentalist schools.   

 We have to help raise the next generation of teachers, doctors, public  servants and engineers, and head off their potential recruitment by terrorist  networks. 

 

 And our third objective must be improving the effectiveness of  international law, strengthening the United Nations and promoting  economic opportunities through multilateral means.   

 

 This is important to Australia for security reasons, but also to enable us to  cope with the challenges posed by asylum seekers.   

 Controlling people movements requires cooperation between the countries of  origin, transit and arrival of asylum seekers.   

 At source, we must deal with the so-called 'push' factors driving the out-flow  of peoples worldwide.     

  5

 This requires, amongst other things, a more committed approach to dealing  with the economics of under-development and the eradication of poverty.   

 But dealing with problems at source must be complemented by putting in  place international assistance and processes for countries of transit.     

 From Australia's perspective, the upcoming CHOGM meeting represents an  important opportunity to promote accession to the 1951 Convention on  Refugees and its 1967 Protocol.     

 To date, there are 13 Commonwealth countries that are not yet signatories to  either the Convention or the Protocol.     

 7 of these countries lie in transit between the Middle East and Australia.   

 If we don’t solve this problem through international forums, we will never  solve it.   

  Regional co-operation on people smuggling must be based on trust.   

 It now appears that the Howard Government misled the Australian people but  has also misled the Indonesian Government on whether the most recent boat  to arrive was carrying asylum seekers. 

 

 This latest example of “Truth Overboard” will only undermine the regional co-operation we need if we are to stop the vile trade of the people smugglers.   

 And we hardly deter the people smugglers if, having caught them, we allow  them to return home scott-free.   

 Although there is a distrust of multilateral security arrangements in Asia, most  countries strongly support the maintenance of international norms of  behaviour and the role of the UN.   

 

 New tensions arose over the recent War in Iraq.   

 Labor opposed the War in Iraq because it wasn’t sanctioned by the United  Nations.   

 We believed that it wasn’t in our national interest to undermine collective  security.   

 But we also understood that support for the War would undermine our  regional standing.   

 The War received tepid agreement from Japan and South Korea - but only  Australia has provided troops.  It was strongly opposed elsewhere.   

  6

 The decision to go to War has been the catalyst for the cold reception we are  now getting in East Asian forums.     

 In addition, as the Chinese President told our parliament recently, economic  development in our region will be best advanced through multilateral means.     

 Improving multilateral trade, not just multilateral security arrangements must  also be our goal.   

 Australia’s stocks in Asia must be improved.     

 This must not be seen as a chore - as it sometimes appears to be for our  current government.  It must be a purposeful national objective.   

 Australia must recapture the activism, leadership and dynamism that was  shown by a previous generation when our nation helped establish the United  Nations, forged the US Alliance and re-engaged with China; established  bodies like APEC, the Cairns Group and the Canberra Commission; and  brokered peace in Cambodia and East Timor. 

 

 As a tangible commitment to boosting national security and prosperity  through stronger relations with our Asian neighbours, we must set ourselves  the objective of making Australia an active partner in the ASEAN Leadership 

 Dialogue within the next 12 months.   

 A new window of opportunity has opened following the recent change of  leadership in Malaysia.   

 Australia’s ties with Britain - and the US -are strong and enduring.   

 It is my firm belief that we can be of most use to each other in the task of  promoting international trade, economic development and security if Australia  assumes its proper and mature place in the decision-making forums of Asia. 

 

 Australian governments since the mid-1940s have supported the policy of  closer regional engagement.   

 It has been one of the most consistent and enduring themes in Australian  foreign policy.   

 Being an active, independent nation engaged in our region and the world is  ultimately about choice.   

 Governments can choose how they employ their diplomatic resources in  certain ways.   

 At the end of the day, Australia will always need to be engaged.   

  7

 The crucial test is whether engagement is done as part of a comprehensive  strategy, or as an offshoot to a more narrow foreign policy agenda.   

 I am determined to ensure that we pursue a comprehensive agenda that is in  Australia’s national interest.
