 Media Release 

 Citizenship for 13 Refugees

 19 June 2005

 Thirteen refugees will celebrate World Refugee Day by becoming Australian citizens at a special citizenship ceremony at  Constitution Centre in West Perth on 20 June.

 The Australian Government Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Peter McGauran, said the conferees were  refugees who have built new lives in Australia.

 ‘Our newest citizens have come from Bosnia, Liberia, Guinea, Chile, Iran and Iraq. I am delighted they are taking the final  step and becoming full participants in the Australian community,’ Minister McGauran said.

 ‘The theme for World Refugee Day 2005 is Courage and this citizenship ceremony is a celebration of the spirit, courage  and determination that characterises humanitarian entrants. 

 ‘Australia has one of the largest dedicated refugee and humanitarian resettlement programs in the world. In the past year  Western Australia has welcomed 1400 arrivals under the Refugee and Special Humanitarian programs,’ Minister  McGauran said.

 ‘Citizenship is the unifying force in our culturally diverse society. I encourage all those who are eligible to apply for  Australian citizenship.’

 Citizenship information is available at www.citizenship.gov.au or from the Citizenship Information Line on 131 880.
