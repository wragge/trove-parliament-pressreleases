 MEDIA RELEASE "Gross failure by Dawkins to  acknowledge responsibility": Kemp

 Mr Dawkins' speech this afternoon on Australia's Education Export  Industry constitutes a gross failure to acknowledge 

 responsibility for the Government's woeful mismanagement of the  education export industry, Dr David Kemp MP, the Shadow Minister  for Education said today.

 "Mr Dawkins repeatedly tried to portray many of the problems  which have arisen as either being unpredictable or the fault of  industry participants. This is hardly the case. As far back as  late 1987, there were reports in the media of overseas students 

 using short term English language courses as a means of 

 permanently entering the country.

 "Rather than respond to these timely warnings, Mr Dawkins chose  to ignore them. Worse still, he went out of his way to create 

 boom time expectations in the industry.

 "The whole problem of Chinese student refugees can be traced  back to Mr Dawkins' irresponsible handling of the education  export industry and his failure to ensure that his Department  properly monitored-visa-violations by overseas students.

 "The Coalition has been calling for discussions between the  Government and Education Export Industry on resolving the  problems affecting the industry. In particular, the Coalition  stressed the need for guidelines to cover the proper management  of student funds. We welcome the Government's decision to act  on these calls.

 "Nonetheless there are still a number of outstanding matters.  There is still a manifest failure on the part of the Department  of Employment, Education and Training to properly monitor visa  compliance by overseas students who arrived in Australia after 

 June 20, 1989. The failure of the Minister to refer to this 

 problem is yet another example of his inability to learn from  past errors.
