 Bob Sercombe MP  Federal Labor Shadow Minister for Overseas Aid and Pacific Island Affairs 

 

 Forging a new Pacific partnership  Speech to launch Towards a Pacific Community,  Labor’s Pacific Policy Discussion Paper  Parliament House, 29 September 2005   

 Check against delivery   

 

 Today is the culmination of six months of intensive work, of intensive consultation, with  our Pacific neighbours and within the Australian community.    

 We have worked together, to develop the proposals needed to forge a new Pacific  partnership between Australia and our neighbours.   

 We believe that when you all live in the same neighbourhood, you should be looking to  develop a community.   

 And so, today, I am very pleased to launch Labor’s Pacific Policy Discussion paper,  Towards a Pacific Community.   

 Towards a Pacific Community is about a new direction for Australia’s Pacific policy.    

 It is about Australia living up to its potential as a good neighbour.   

 Towards a Pacific Community is about forging closer regional ties with our neighbours.  Of breaking down the barriers dividing the neighbourhood.   

 It is about the Pacific living up to its potential to be a peaceful, prosperous region.   

 Towards a Pacific Community is about providing a beacon of hope for the Pacific’s  citizens.   

 

 

 The past   

 Labor believes we need to forge a new partnership for a new era.   

 Because Labor rejects the Howard government’s heavy-handed approach to the Pacific.   

 The Howard government has had nine long years to get its Pacific policy right. 

 

 Unfortunately, the Howard government has only two policy settings for the Pacific:  hands-off, or heavy-handed.   

 Its hands-off approach is demonstrated by the Prime Minister’s failure to attend various  meetings of the Pacific Islands Forum, the region’s most important political institution.    

 The Howard government’s hands-off approach is demonstrated by its response to the  Solomon Islands in 2000, when our neighbour first asked for our help.   

 As late as January 2003, Alexander Downer opposed helping the Solomon Islands.   

 Mr Downer wrote, “Sending in Australian troops to occupy Solomon Islands would be  folly in the extreme… it would not work.”   

 It was only in July 2003 that the Howard government realised Australia had to help.   

 RAMSI enjoys bipartisan support - but giving a helping hand earlier would have saved  lives and considerable expense for Australian taxpayers.   

 The Howard government clearly lacks a long-term plan for the Pacific, to manage  security issues at an early stage, and to prevent crises.   

 Labor believes a better approach is needed.   

 Labor believes in an old-fashioned notion, that good policy-making should be about  looking beyond this week or this month.    

 Good policy-making should be about looking forward, to the next year, the next ten  years, the next twenty years.   

 The Howard government also seems unable to approach our Pacific neighbours in a spirit  of partnership.   

 Why is it that the Pacific must look to New Zealand for leadership on the issue of  environmental refugees?   

 Why did Alexander Downer refuse to meet a delegation from the Tongan Parliament,  particularly given the challenges these parliamentarians face to create a real democracy in  that country? 

 

 When there is no sense of partnership, Australia’s influence is reduced.  Our national  interest suffers. There can be no effective working relationship.   

 We see this in the difficulties with the Enhanced Cooperation Program with Papua New  Guinea. 

 

 Our relationship with Papua New Guinea should be a model to the world, of what a  developed and developing country can achieve when they work together.   

 Instead, Australia and Papua New Guinea have a very brittle relationship, which can be  disrupted by an airport security check.   

 Following this incident, Alexander Downer chose to lecture the Prime Minister of Papua  New Guinea on Papua New Guinean culture, saying “One of the characteristics of Papua  New Guinean and Melanesian culture more generally is that they have the notion of what  they call the big man.”   

 Alexander Downer would never have dared speak like this in referring to the President of  the United States, or the President of China.   

 It is only in the Pacific that the Howard government feels like it can act like a bully.   

 Labor believes in an old-fashioned notion, of treating your neighbour as you would like  to be treated yourself.   

 

 

 The future   

 Labor’s approach to the Pacific will be guided by three key ideas.   

 Firstly, Australia must pursue leadership in partnership with our Pacific neighbours.    

 Australia cannot afford to have a heavy-handed approach if we want to work effectively  with our neighbours.  Australia can be a catalyst for change, but only if we establish a  more genuine partnership with our Pacific neighbours.     

 Secondly, prevention is better than cure.    

 A major security crisis is enormously damaging for the region, and expensive for the  countries assisting to resolve it. The Pacific must collectively commit to the policies and  institutions needed to prevent crises, not just cure them.   

 

 Thirdly, we need to break down the barriers.    

 The Pacific collectively needs to break down the barriers between our people; between  our economies; between our governments; and between our regional institutions.   

 

 

 Towards a Pacific Community   

 Around the world, countries pursuing closer regional ties have benefited from increased  economic growth and better security.    

 For over thirty years, Pacific countries have had a framework for cooperation through the  Pacific Islands Forum.    

 Labor believes it is timely to consider how to develop that framework, and move to the  next phase of Pacific regional cooperation.    

 Together, we should start thinking about where we would like to be in another thirty  years time.   

 Labor believes we should work together, to build on the Pacific Islands Forum and other  regional institutions.   

 We should aim to realise a new era of cooperation, and forge a much closer partnership,  through a Pacific Community.   

 In some instances, this will involve Pacific island countries adopting new policies.   

 But there are areas where Australia must also do things differently, and better, by its  neighbours.   

 We believe the Pacific Community should involve the following agreements and  institutions.   

 â¢ A Pacific Common Market, so that we can break down the barriers between our  economies.    

 This would include allowing Pacific citizens, in limited numbers, to come to  Australia to work. The Howard government is already letting in 100,000  backpackers through the Working Holiday Maker Visa scheme to work around  Australia. Why can’t we help citizens in developing countries in our own Pacific  neighbourhood?   

 Sharan Burrow and the National Farmers Federation have said they support a  Pacific labour mobility scheme - it is only the Howard government that is  lagging.    

 â¢ A regional commitment to inflation targeting, and assistance to those Pacific  countries that may wish to adopt the Australian dollar.   

 â¢ A Pacific Peace and Security Centre, to help prevent and manage security crises.   

 â¢ A new approach to promoting good governance, where we welcome Pacific  officials to work in Australian agencies, rather than just sending out Australian  advisers.   

 â¢ A Pacific Environment and Resource Agency, with greater powers and police on  its staff to prevent illegal logging and deal with other environmental problems.   

 â¢ A Pacific Health Centre, to combat HIV/AIDs.   

 â¢ Better people-to-people links, through greater cultural and sporting ties.  I have been very encouraged in recent times, even though I’m a Victorian, by the  efforts of rugby league to build stronger links in Papua New Guinea. I hope one  day we build up to having a Papua New Guinea team compete in a genuinely  Australasian rugby league competition.   

 And let’s not forget the efforts of the AFL as well - I was pleased to see Papua  New Guinea as runner-up in the recent international Aussie rules competition.    

 I want to strengthen these sort of people-to-people links so that the relationship  between Australia and the Pacific is much deeper and stronger.  Hopefully we can  have Pacific netball teams, and many others, coming to Australia to train and  compete.   

 â¢ A Pacific Women’s Centre, to promote greater gender equality.   

 â¢ A Pacific Population Centre, to assist Pacific countries to develop national  population initiatives.   

 â¢ A Pacific Education Centre, to promote regional exchanges of teachers and  students.   

 â¢ A Pacific Children and Youth Centre, to promote greater opportunities for the  Pacific’s young people.   

 â¢ A Pacific Human Rights Commission, to promote and protect human rights.    

 â¢ A Pacific Court, to enforce the regional treaty needed to establish the Pacific  Community.   

 â¢ A Pacific Parliament, so that the region’s politicians can gather at least once each  year to consider and debate particularly important issues.   

 In some cases, this is a matter of building on, and strengthening, existing Pacific  institutions and agreements. In other cases, it is a matter of creating new institutions, to  realise a comprehensive regional community. 

 

 We are putting forward these proposals, not as rigid template of what must happen, but to  offer a clear vision of how the region may develop, and what Australia should bring to  the table.    

 We are putting forward these proposals because our Pacific neighbourhood matters, and  we are prepared to put the time and energy into promoting fresh ideas.    

 We believe it is better to discuss and debate a clear vision, and we welcome and look  forward to that dialogue.   

 

 

 The way ahead   

 I am gratified that a number of Pacific leaders have been prepared to publicly state their  support for these proposals. Business leaders, union leaders and non-governmental  organisations have also stated their support.   

 At the end of October, leaders from across the Pacific will be meeting in Port Moresby  for the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders meeting.   

 John Howard is supposed to be attending.   

 Given the concerns in the Pacific about the Howard government’s approach, and given  the support for Labor’s proposals, we believe Mr Howard should consider a new  approach.   

 We believe the Prime Minister should listen to the Pacific’s calls to use Labor’s proposals  as the basis for discussion at that meeting.   

 The Forum Leaders meeting in a month’s time should represent the start of a new era.   

 Labor is prepared to work with the Howard government to realise these proposals for a  Pacific Community.   

 Because the Pacific is our neighbourhood - and being a good neighbour shouldn’t depend  on who is in government in Australia.   

 

 

 A new Pacific voyage   

 Labor’s vision for a Pacific Community is vital and it is timely.   

 This vision is achievable if Pacific countries, particularly Australia, commit to a new  phase in their relations. 

 

 This is the start of a new Pacific voyage, not the end.    

 The Pacific citizens who we consulted have been supportive of these proposals, and  indeed have added to and strengthened them. But it will be important to continue working  closely with the Pacific, as these proposals are developed and, in time, implemented.   

 Labor will proceed in a spirit of partnership as we take this voyage together.   

 The voyage may not always be easy.   

 But the promise of a Pacific Community awaits the Pacific and its citizens.   

 It’s time to begin.   

 Thank you.
