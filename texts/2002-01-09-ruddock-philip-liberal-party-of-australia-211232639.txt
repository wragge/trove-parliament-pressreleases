 LA Times Response

 MPS 002/2002

 Attached is the detailed response to the articles Bane of the Boat People and The 'Crime' of Being a Young Refugee published in the Los Angeles Times on January 4 and 5.

 As the attached rebuttal outlines, the two articles were riddled with inaccuracies and distortions that seek to erode the pride we as a nation are entitled to feel about the hand we extend to those in great humanitarian need.

 The article has been forwarded to the Los Angeles Times in an effort to outline Australia's outward-looking and global approach to migration and its longstanding and generous humanitarian program.

 Australia's Immigration Minister Responds to Articles

 Australia is a nation that has a very proud - arguably unrivalled - record of assisting people in great humanitarian need.

 We are an active participant in global refugee settlement, with our contribution dating back to the 1930s when we took 7,000 German Jews. Since the Second World War we have taken 600,000 refugee and humanitarian settlers - about 10 per cent of our total migrant numbers.

 In the last year under Australia's refugee and humanitarian program, 13,733 people were given visas for Australia. This is one of the highest in the world, and around double that of the United States on a per capita basis.

 Australia is in fact one of only 10 or so countries in the world that operates a dedicated offshore resettlement program which accepts the world's most needy and desperate refugees. Australia is also among the 12 largest donors of financial resources to the UNHCR's core budget.

 There are currently 21.8 million refugees and people of concern throughout the world. Australia cannot take them all but we demonstrate every year that we will continue our efforts to assist those most in need. We will not resile, however, from stopping those acting illegally.

 It is within this broader framework of decades of compassion and international cooperation that your articles are notable for their lack of attention to the detail surrounding Australia's program of dealing with asylum seekers and unlawful arrivals to our country. There are a number of inaccuracies and distortions that need correction.

 Chief among such claims is the allegation that Australian Government policies are responsible for the deaths of people who drowned at sea while travelling to Australia.

 As tragic as those events were, the Australian Government cannot be held responsible for

 illegal actions that occur outside our international boundary.

 In fact, our policies and actions in the international community are designed to discourage people from moving unlawfully from country to country.

 The source of many of the distortions in the articles may be some of the small number of advocacy groups in Australia opposed to Government policy.

 Simplistically, they think that people who come to Australia covertly and against the law should be treated like heroes and rewarded. The result of this attitude is to encourage others to come, thus endangering more lives.

 Let me present a few facts to put these important issues into perspective - something my office, my Department, or myself, would have been glad to do had your journalist sought them prior to publication.

 I am advised your journalist made one call to my Department's public affairs section but failed to raise any questions or issues that related to immigration detention.

 Firstly, it is important to remember that just like the United States, Australia is a sovereign country which alone determines who is allowed entry and who is not, and has laws which protect its borders and safeguards its citizens.

 People violate those laws when they pay large sums of money to criminal gangs of people smugglers to bring them to Australia's shores, risking their lives and those of their families in the process. They violate those laws when they arrive illegally without any documentation.

 Contrary to the article's claims the Australian Government does not "lock up" refugees, nor does it detain people for seeking asylum.

 We do, however, place in detention people who arrive unlawfully until their asylum claims are determined and we find out whom they are, where they are from, and whether they have criminal records or health concerns.

 To do otherwise, and let them free into the community, is to risk their disappearance, as many other countries, to their great frustration, have discovered. Once a person is determined to be a refugee, they are released immediately.

 Your reporter further asserts that Australia is alone in the international community in its policy of immigration detention.

 This is wrong as the US, Canada and the UK are moving towards more rigorous detention systems and already detain people - a simple, and easily determined fact.

 In Australia the great majority of detainees spend on average only 15 weeks in detention while their claims are processed.

 Most of those who stay longer have been found not to be refugees and have chosen to pursue avenues of further review and litigation, lengthening their detention. They need not remain in detention - they are free to depart Australia at any time.

 Perhaps the most lamentable of your reporter's claims is that we have used leg locks on children. No such practices have ever been used in Australian detention centres.

 In relation to education, and again contrary to your article's assertions, we provide social and educational programs appropriate to the child's age and abilities to all children in detention.

 Although not compulsory, children are encouraged to participate in the educational programs available. In some detention facilities, children attend local schools. In others, a school curriculum based program is provided and is conducted by appropriately qualified staff. Social and recreational activities are also organised.

 Your articles also question the Australian Government's tolerance to Islamic asylum seekers, claiming that Australia has practised racial discrimination during much of its existence. The facts could not be anymore to the contrary.

 Australia is one of the most culturally diverse nations in the world. It is home to people from more than 200 different birthplaces with almost 23% of the population born overseas, compared with just 9% in the US.

 Your reporter rightly says that many asylum seekers leave their homeland and "first reach safety in neighbouring countries such as Pakistan and Iran."

 What is omitted is that in so doing, they have already reached a safe haven in another country where they could remain, free from persecution and danger.

 However, they make a lifestyle choice to travel to Australia, breaking the laws of many countries on the way.

 In comparison, there are millions of people living in squalid refugee camps who do not have this luxury, nor the money to pay criminals to smuggle them across borders.

 The unlawful movement of people in search of a better life directly undermines the limited capacity of countries like Australia to assist the UNHCR in resettling people in greatest need.

 Many people who arrive in Australia illegally have come originally from harsh and difficult conditions; often leaving loved ones behind and bringing a certain amount of anxiety and stress with them.

 Among this population feelings of loss, grief, anxiety and stress would obviously be present in some of the people.

 It is unreasonable and inappropriate to suggest that these psychological problems are solely attributable to being in detention centres.

 It is clear that Australian detention centres offer a full range of health and psychological services. These are provided by fully qualified doctors, nurses and other health professionals and have been checked time and again by organisations such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, UNHCR, and parliamentary committees.

 The level and range of these services are the same as those available to the wider Australian community and even exceeds those in some regional areas.

 Allow me to place on record the broader range of facilities provided in Australian detention centres. At Villawood in Sydney for example, there are 29 televisions for 323 people, 21 video recorders and DVD machines, two stereo systems, 18 computers, one Nintendo game system, four computer game consoles, board games and musical equipment.

 In addition there are 19 Australian and foreign language newspapers regularly available to detainees. There is also a variety of sporting equipment including pool tables, exercise machines, bicycles and volleyball courts.

 There are reading rooms, a library, recreation rooms, an arts and crafts room, and a women's centre.

 Furthermore, religious and cultural beliefs and practices are observed and special dietary requirements are met.

 Let me make it clear that Australia is a compassionate, tolerant, strong and prosperous nation.

 Australia's immigration program - one of the few such programs in the world, which this year will grant visas to 93,000 people - reflects these ideals. It does not discriminate on the ground of race, religion, colour or ethnicity.

 While the media largely focuses on Australia's approach to unauthorised boat arrivals, it is crucial that the broader scope of Australia's internationally envied assistance to refugees is understood.

 It is also vital that unfounded and patently incorrect claims are not used to form judgements that erode the pride we as a nation are entitled to feel about the hand we extend to those in such great need.
