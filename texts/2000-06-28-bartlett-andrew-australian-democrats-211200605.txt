 Senator Andrew Bartlett Senator for Queensland Australian Democrats spokesperson for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

 Press Release Dated: 30 Jun 2000 Press Release Number: 00/384 Portfolio: Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Related: Human Rights (Domestic)

 Refugee Inquiry Report tabled: Unanimous findings demonstrate problems with onshore refugee program The report of the Senate inquiry into Australia’s refugee program, initiated by the Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, was released today.

 The Democrats moved for the inquiry in May 1999 following calls by Amnesty International, the International Commission of Jurists and the Law Council, for a closer look at the effectiveness of our onshore refugee program.

 Senator Bartlett said the inquiry produced a lot of information which would not otherwise be on the record and clearly showed that our system is not as perfect as the Government likes to claim.

 “Many aspects of our onshore refugee program provide cause for concern and the evidence provided and the Committee’s report reflect this.

 “On a personal level I would have liked stronger statements and recommendations in some areas of the report, but I am very pleased we were able to achieve a unanimous report in almost all areas,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “Given how politicised refugee issues have become, the cross-party agreement on the recommendations is all the more significant. The Government must acknowledge the problems which the inquiry identified and take its findings seriously, particularly given the cross-party support.

 “There are clearly some problems associated with the closed decision making process of the Refugee Review Tribunal, particularly with the restriction placed on the independence of the Tribunal members by the power of the Minister controlling appointments,” he said.

 “More scrutiny can only improve the quality of decision making and public confidence in it.

 “The evidence outlined in the report highlights the dangers of the concentration of power in the hands of the Minister and his Department. This is clearly demonstrated over the debacle with the temporary safe haven visas for the Kosovar people.

 “Individual cases such as the Chinese woman who was returned to face a forced abortion when 8 months pregnant give real life examples of the flaws in the existing approach and the perils it puts individuals in,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “People’s lives are put at risk if we get things wrong, so it is important to continually look for flaws in our processes and identify ways to continue to improve them. This task is far from over.

 “This report should assist all political parties and legislators in the important task of meeting our obligations and protecting the rights of refugees and asylum seekers, who are some of the most vulnerable people in the world.”
