 Leader of the Opposition

 2 December 1991 REF: TRANSCR\0317\BQ

 DR JOHN HEWSON, MP  TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE  NSW GOLF CLUB, SYDNEY

 E & 0 E - PROOF COPY ONLY

 SUBJECTS: Balance of Payments, Fightback, Government policies.

 Jrnlst:

 ... (inaudible) ...

 Hewson:

 ... (inaudible) ... problems in Australia are very deep seated  despite the recession we are still getting balance of payments  numbers on a monthly basis above $1 billion. And it is one of  the reasons why we have argued that there is a very urgent need 

 for dramatic economic and social change. If you thought about  it 2 or 3 years ago that we would be in the worst recession in 

 60 years and the balance of payments would be still running over  $1 billion a month you would have been appalled, and that is what  the Government should be and it should be responding.

 Jrnlsti

 Anything immediately you suggest the Government should or could  do?

 Hewson:

 There is plenty of things they can do straight away. We think  that they can move to a genuine process of enterprise bargaining  straight away, they could forego any future national wage cases  and on that basis, all wage determinations at the workplace and 

 only wage increases to be given in relation to productivity. They could scrap their idea of occupational super which will add  100,000 people to the unemployment rolls. They could certainly  cut immigration and ease the pressure on the job market. They 

 could, I think, move very quickly to accelerate some major  development projects, they talk a lot about it but with 

 Coronation Hill sitting there - why don't they approve it -_____ _

 â¢y

 Wesley Vale type pulp mills could go ahead, the three mines  uranium policy could be scrapped, plenty of development projects  could be accelerate and, of course, over and above that the whole  process of reform could be accelerated - in electricity, 

 waterfront, shipping, whatever.

 Jralst:

 ... (inaudible) ...

 Hewson:

 Well some things will work fairly quickly and others, obviously  will take a while, but the point is the longer you leave them the  longer it takes. At this point the Government is not even 

 prepared to admit there is a problem, they're running around as  if there is no problem in Australia and they're devoting all  their time to attacking our package instead of getting ahead and  developing a viable alternative and putting it in place. I think  that is a very sad commentary, in over a week now they have been  unable to dent it in any sense, our "Fightback" package stands  unquestioned and I would suggest that instead of spending this  week on guerilla tactics and lying and misrepresenting and saying  what they have been doing in the last week, they should get on 

 and deal with some of our problems. The people of Australia  would welcome an effort by the Government to solve the problem.

 Jralst:

 What is your reaction to government speculation about the tax  cuts?

 Hewson:

 Well we are not surprised that they are going to go the tax cut  route, I would like to know what they are going to do and how 

 they are going to fund them. At the very least, they should be  planning to hand back bracket creep before the next election,  they would be at least a couple of billion dollars worth of tax  cuts but they are going to have to fund them. The beauty of our  package is that we make major change and we make it in a way that 

 is totally responsible - we run a bigger fiscal surplus and we  fund all our tax cuts. So, I think if they just go the tax cut 

 route and try and buy their way back into Government they'll get  the fate they deserve. People are not looking to be bought off,  they are looking for major change, we have genuine reform and you  can't bring down reliable and sustainable tax cuts without the  rest of the package - that is genuine reform.

 Jrulst:

 Mr Hawke has admitted that his attack on your GST package has  failed somewhat. Were you surprised that he was so frank?

 Hewson:

 Well I would think after he performed as badly as he did in 

 Parliament last week ... (inaudible) ... he w a s , but I think the  point is a bit bigger than that, he should get on and develop an  alternative. People do not want a Prime Minister that goes all 

 over the country carping and whingeing and being negative, they  want a Prime Minister that recognises that we have got major  problems in this country and gets on and solves them. If he is  going to devote the next couple to guerilla tactics, I don't 

 think he will earn the respect of the people of Australia, he  won't dent our credibility, the only credibility he will lose is  the little bit that he still carries with him and I really do  think that there is a genuine challenge there for the Prime 

 Minister to get and do what is required in this country. If he  embraces the essence of our package we will obviously support him  in putting it in place.

 Jrnlst:

 Mr Hawke says he still can destroy it before the next election.  Do you agree with that?

 Hewson:

 I don't think he can destroy it, I think he will only succeed in  destroying himself, but I think it is the wrong attitude - people  don't want a Prime Minister that sets with an 18 month campaign  to destroy the Opposition, they want a Prime Minister that spends  his time in government governing. It has now become a total pre­ occupation with Bob Hawke to destroy us, he is even going to 

 solicit the help of the ultimate destroyer, Paul Keating, what  a turn up for the books to go back to Keating, a guy who has 

 inflicted all this pain and hardship on the people of Australia,  to join forces with the Prime Minister to destroy u s . In the  meantime, every average Australian continues to see their  standard of living falling, unemployment to continue to rise to 

 over 11%, already nearly 1 million Australians unemployed, they  want the Prime Minister to get on and govern and they want the  ex-Treasurer to get on and help him.

 Jrnlst:

 ... (inaudible) ...

 REF: TRANSCR\0317\BQ 4.

 Hewson:

 Both of them suggested a consumption tax in 1985, I thought one  of the most relevant and, in fact, one of the strongest sections  of our whole "Fightback" package was the section that was headed  "The Case for a Broad Based Goods and Services Tax by R J L Hawke 

 and P J Keating", it is excellent reading, I would recommend it  to everyone.

 Jrnlst:

 You are obviously not worried about Mr Keating?

 Hewson:

 No, no Mr Keating doesn't worry us at all. He will be damned by  his own actions, he after all has been the architect of the 

 demise, we are still seeing it, today's balance of payments  number is further evidence that nothing is turning around despite  the fact that he has pitched us into the worst recession in 60  years.  Mr Hawke and Mr Keating, history will judge them by what 

 they have done. There only hope, in fact, to resurrect a bit of  standing in terms of history is to get on and govern this 

 country.

 Jrnlst:

 ... (inaudible) ... ignored Paul Keating in 1985.

 Hewson:

 Yes, I think they made a fundamental mistake and I think they now  know it and I think they're a bit shattered that the electorate  of Australia is prepared to wear fundamental change, the polls  last week said that the Government really should have gone ahead 

 and done it. Really, the way we look at our package is that we  are simply saying to the Government this is what you should have  done for the last 8 years and we'd have a dramatically different  country right now.

 Jrnlst:

 ... (inaudible) ...

 Hewson:

 I don't know, it's been a while since we have played, so I'll see  what happens. I've been trying to get a bit of a swing back in  the last couple of days but I think I might have been pre­

 occupied with the "Fightback" and this might be the ultimate  fightback today.

 ... (inaudible) ...

 Hews on:

 Well I'll have to try, I'm always happy to play golf with the  Prime Minister to raise money for charity, I'm disappointed he  is not here today. But anytime he wants to play golf with the  prize going to a reputable charity, the best opportunity, it can 

 go to McDonald's charity is he is so inclined, but I think it  would be great if he did come out and turn all his arigst against  a golf ball.
