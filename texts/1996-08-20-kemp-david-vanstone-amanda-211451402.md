  Joint Statement 

  FOCUS ON THE FUTURE 

  V64/96 20 August 1996 

  The 1996-97 Federal Budget contains a wide range of reforms and measures right across the  employment, education, training and youth affairs portfolio . 

  The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone,  and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr David Kemp, said the Budget  measures announced for the portfolio were far-sighted, fiscally responsible and equitable . 

  The Ministers outlined key reforms across a range of policies, programmes and services . 

  Better targeted assistance for the unemployed 

  Senator Vanstone said the Government would spend $5.4 billion over the next four years on labour  market and training programme assistance. 

  "We aim to make significant savings on labour market programmes that don't get full value for the  taxpayers' dollar, essentially by unwinding the massive and largely ineffective increase in expenditure  from Working Nation and taking us back to more reasonable levels of expenditure," she said. 

  "The Working Nation evaluation, recently released by my Department, found that resources were  shifted from less expensive programmes with better outcomes to expensive programmes with poor  outcomes which were oflittle benefit to unemployed people. 

  "While labour market programme commencements will fall from around 731,000 in 1995-96 to  525,000 in 1996-97, many oflast year's commencements were undertaken simply to fill courses and  be seen to be doing something for the unemployed. 

  "SimplifYing and streamlining labour market programmes is long overdue. The number and complexity  oflabour market programmes has been a significant problem both for clients and stafffor a long  time." 

  A flexible and responsive training system 

  Dr Kemp said the Federal Government will reform Australia's training system to meet the needs of  business and apprentices and trainees . 

  He said the new Modem Australian Apprenticeship and Traineeship System would lead to real jobs  for thousands of young Australians and stimulate the growth of Australian business, particularly small  and medium enterprises. 

  Details of the four-year $3.7 billion funding package include:

  o an extra $200 million to implement the new system;  o establishing new single point contact centres throughout regional Australia to link prospective  apprentices and trainees with suitable local employers and service their needs. This is part of  $140 million for infrastructure;  o a major vocational education and training programme for schools of $187 million over four 

  years;  o $54 million for new multiple placement apprenticeships to work in more than one enterprise  through Group Training Companies. 

  "Australia's training system will enter a new era of simplicity, flexibility and responsiveness," Dr Kemp  said. 

  Commonwealth funding for schools 

  Australia's 10,000 schools will receive an extra $167 million from the Federal Government in the  1996/97 financial year, Dr Kemp announced. 

  The total Commonwealth Budget for schools will increase by five per cent from $3.28 billion in  1995/96 to $3.44 billion in 1996/97. 

  Schools will receive more than $14 billion in the next four years. Dr Kemp will next month introduce  legislation confirming the quadrennial funding package for schools to the year 2000. 

  "The Government has more than delivered on its promise to maintain specific purpose payments to  schools," he said. 

  Features of the four-year funding package include: 

  o $187 million for vocational education in schools;  o $45 million for a National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy to improve the reading, writing and  numeracy skills of all school children; and  o $56.7 million for Asian Languages. 

  The National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy will build on recently-announced initiatives to improve  literacy and numeracy standards, including the nation's first National Literacy Goal, national literacy  benchmarks at Years 3 and Year 5 and Australia's first National Literacy Survey in 16 years, which  began earlier this month. 

  More effective student assistance 

  Senator Vanstone said changes to the Federal Government's student assistance schemes will make  them fairer and provide a more efficient use of public funds. 

  "The Coalition Government is firmly committed to maintaining the level of benefits to eligible families  which AUSTUDY provides. At the same time, we want to send a strong message to the whole  Australian community that well-off families with extensive assets or high incomes will not be eligible  to receive financial assistance via AUSTUDY ," she said. 

  Key student assistance changes are: 

  o AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY age of independence raised to 25 years 

  Senator Vanstone said the age at which AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY students are considered independent

  of their parents, and so not subject to the parental means test, would be raised from 22 to 25 years  from 1 January 1997. 

  Students who are being paid the independent rate in 1996 and who, but for the new measure would  subsequently be paid that rate, will continue to be assessed as independent. 

  o Two-year waiting period for AUSTUDY for migrants who arrive in Australia from 1 January  1997 

  Senator Vanstone said migrants arriving in Australia as permanent residents on or after 1 January  1997 will need to wait two years before they may be eligible to receive AUSTUDY. 

  A safety net exemption from the waiting period will be available to refugee and humanitarian migrants  and their immediate family members. 

  o AUSTUDY Actual Means Test 

  The target groups for the Actual Means Test will be expanded to close loopholes identified in 1996.  Families in hardship in drought-affected areas will continue to be exempt from the Actual Means Test  and income earned by students from bona fide employment outside a family business will be deducted  from Actual Means. 

  o Assistance for Isolated Children (AlC) Scheme 

  In accordance with our election commitment, from 1 January 1997 the amount of the  non-income-tested Basic Boarding Allowance will increase from $2500 to $2900. 

  Senator Vanstone said this increase would restore the amount of the Basic Boarding Allowance to 55  per cent of the average level of boarding fees paid for boarding students receiving AlC benefits. 

  "From 1 January 1997, the amount of the non-income tested Correspondence Allowance will increase  to $1000 a year for primary students and to $1500 a year for secondary students," she said. 

  Proposed Youth Allowance 

  Senator Vanstone said young Australians would get a much better deal with the proposal in the  Federal Budget to develop a single Youth Allowance from January 1998. 

  The Youth Allowance would be introduced from January 1998 and would apply to all 16-20 year-oIds  and to full-time students until the end of the year they tum 25. 

  The Youth Allowance would replace the following programmes for young people: AUSTUDY, the  AUSTUDY Supplement, the Youth Training Allowance, Job Search Allowance, Sickness Allowance;  and the more-than...;minimum Family Payment for those ineligible under AUSTUDY provisions . 

  Senator Vanstone said the Federal Government is committed to undertaking a widespread public  consultation process to seek community views on the features of the proposed Youth Allowance and  has released a discussion paper with the Budget to facilitate this process. 

  A competitive market for employment placement services 

  Senator Vanstone said the Government will create a fully competitive market for employment  placement services . These services will be provided by a corporatised public employment placement

  enterprise beside private and community employment placement agencies. 

  "Fully competitive labour exchange services will be provided through employment placement  enterprises for eligible jobseekers . These services will involve screening and job referral services and  additional help with job search skills in some cases," she said. "It is about providing a better service at  a lower cost," she said. 

  "A new service delivery agency will deliver simpler government income support and labour market  services to a wide range of people in a more streamlined and client focussed approach. It will be a  'one-stop-shop' for most clients and a 'first-stop-shop' for those jobseekers who need more help to get  ajob. " 

  Commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education 

  Senator Vanstone said measures announced in the Budget were a clear demonstration of the Federal  Government's strong commitment to improving the educational opportunities and outcomes of  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. 

  "The Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Act 1996 was recently passed to  provide an additional $96 million through to the end of 1999 for the Aboriginal Education Strategic  Initiatives Programme (AESIP). This funding is on top of $83 million per year in existing funding  commitments to the AESIP," she said. 

  Over the next three years the Government will provide a total of $72 million in support of  comprehensive strategies to achieve increased participation by Indigenous Australians in Higher  Education. 

  An environmental Green Corp for young Australians 

  Senator Vanstone announced the establishment of a new Green Corp programme that will benefit  both young Australians and the environment. 

  The Federal Government will provide more than $40 million over the next three years so that 3,500  young Australians can have the opportunity take part in projects that will develop their own career  prospects and help to restore Australia's natural environment and maintain our heritage. 

  Senator Vanstone said the Green Corps would be open to all young Australians between the ages of  17 and 20. Participants will work full-time on projects for 26 weeks with an option to extend to a full  year .. 

  High priority for Australia's international education and training activities 

  Senator Vanstone said the Government would maintain the Australian International Education  Foundation (AIEF) as a genuine government-industry partnership for promoting Australia's  international education and training capabilities and to realise the vision of Australia as a recognised  world leader in education and training. 

  The Australian education and training community will also be supported in its international objectives  through $6.5 million in funding in 1996-97 for international education and training programmes  focussing on countries and regions consistent with Australia's trade and foreign relation priorities .
