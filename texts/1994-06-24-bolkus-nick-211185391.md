 FAMILIES TELL THEIR STORIES IN REFUGEE WEEK

 Refugees from  Iran, Vietnam, Iran, Eritrea, Hungary, Kurdistan, Ethiopa and  Afghanistan have told their stories as part of Refugee W eek 1994.

 The experiences o f families who have settled throug ho ut Australia are related in  Refugee Reflections, a collection of stories released by the M inister for Im m igration  and Ethnic A ffairs, Senator Nick Bolkus, in Sydney today.

 "The story o f m igration to Australia has always been a human story o f courage  and hope," Senator Bolkus said.

 "For the half a million refugees who have fled their homelands to build a new  life  in Australia since W orld War 11, it has also been a story o f incredible suffering,  hardship, strength and endurance.

 "There is no better w ay for Australians to understand the global problem of  refugees than to learn about w hat they w ent through, and their experiences as  they settle into this society."

 Speaking at a you th forum  on m ulticulturalism  and racism in S ydney's M acarthur  region, Senator Bolkus launched Refugee R eflections w ith  a com prehensive  overview  o f the scope, com position and im plem entation o f the G overnm ent's  Humanitarian Program as well as the dimensions o f global population m ovem ents,  entitled Refugee and Humanitarian issues: the focus fo r A ustralia.

 "A ustralia has a long-standing com m itm ent to assist international efforts in  preventing and alleviating humanitarian crises not only through resettlem ent, but  also through diplom atic initiatives and aid," Senator Bolkus said.

 "N ational Refugee W eek is a time when all Australians can reflect on our good  fortune th a t our homeland is a safe and secure en viron m en t."

 Thirteen thousand people will be resettled in Australia through A ustralia's  Humanitarian Program for 1994/95.
