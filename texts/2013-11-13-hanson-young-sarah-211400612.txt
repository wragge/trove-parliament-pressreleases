 Greens to move TPV disallowance today   

 The Australian Greens will move a disallowance motion in the Senate today to scrap the  reintroduction of Temporary Protection Visas.   

 “The Greens’ disallowance motion has the power to scrap Tony Abbott’s version of  Howard-era cruelty,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “TPVs are senselessly harsh. They’re a proven failure as a deterrent and, by removing  family reunions, they force more women and children onto boats.   

 “If the Senate votes in favour of the Greens’ motion today, people who have already  been assessed to be genuine refugees will be able to find permanent protection in our  country.   

 “Australia is a generous nation and the Parliament should do its best to reflect that at  every opportunity.”
