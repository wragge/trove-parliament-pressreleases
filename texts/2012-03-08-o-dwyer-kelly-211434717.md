 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I’m going to say something about International Women’s Day in a moment but I’d like to open these  comments by referring people to the absolute scandal of Fair Work Australia refusing to cooperate with  Victorian and New South Wales police over the Craig Thomson matter. Fair Work Australia is a law  enforcement agency. It is unconscionable that Fair Work Australia is refusing to cooperate with other law  enforcement agencies, absolutely unconscionable. It is almost as if Fair Work Australia is obstructing the  course of justice by refusing to cooperate with criminal investigations into Craig Thomson. We know that  there is an incestuous relationship between the union movement and the Labor Party. We know that there is  a heavy union or former union element in Fair Work Australia and unless Fair Work Australia is prepared to  cooperate fully with other law enforcement agencies in this matter, the suspicion has to be that Fair Work  Australia is engaging in institutional protection of someone who has - on the evidence so far available -  very badly let down his members and the further suspicion has to be that Fair Work Australia is engaged in  protecting the Government because we all know that this government’s survival in the Parliament depends  upon there being no by-elections.    

 So, I call on Fair Work Australia to cooperate with police investigations and I demand that the Prime  Minister state where she stands on this, whether she thinks it’s acceptable for a law enforcement agency to  refuse to cooperate with a police investigation. If members of the public were to act this way, we may well  be liable to prosecution ourselves, and yet here we have a law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth,  set up by legislation that the Prime Minister herself took through the Parliament, refusing in an absolutely  unconscionable way to cooperate with New South Wales and Victorian police.   

 Now, today is International Women’s Day. I want to thank the ladies of Presentation College for making me  and Michaelia Cash, the Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Women and Kelly O’Dwyer, the local  member, so welcome. This is an important day. It is a day for us to recommit ourselves to full participation  in all aspects of our national life by the women of Australia.

 So, today I can announce as part of our commitment to women, that under a Coalition government at least  1,000 a year of our humanitarian and refugee intake will be women at risk and Michaelia will have a little  more to say about this in a moment.    

 I also want to recommit the Coalition to a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme - a paid parental leave  scheme that gives mothers six months pay at their full wage. I want to say that if we are fair dinkum about  justice and opportunity for the women of Australia, if we are fair dinkum about genuine choice for the  women of Australia, there must be a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme. Parental leave is not a welfare  entitlement. Parental leave is a workplace entitlement and that’s why it has to be paid at someone’s ordinary  wage. People don’t go on holiday and get paid a welfare allowance. People don’t get paid a welfare  allowance if they have to take sick leave, they get paid at their wage and they should get paid at their wage  when they are taking parental leave and again, I say to the Prime Minister, why is she standing in the way of  progress for Australian women? Why isn’t she prepared to own up to the fact that her paid parental leave  scheme is simply a re-badged Baby Bonus and commit the Government to working towards the kind of  policy that the Coalition is very proud to have had for the last two years. So, this is an important advance.  It’s a sign that the Coalition gets it when it comes to the modern Australian woman and I’ve got to say that  as far as I am concerned, this is an absolute signature policy. It is an absolute signature policy. It is going to  be one of the defining marks of my leadership of the Coalition.    

 Michaelia?   

 SENATOR MICHAELIA CASH:   

 Thank you, Tony and thank you, Kelly. It’s great to be here today as the Coalition’s spokesperson for the  status of women at Presentation College. International Women’s Day gives us an opportunity as Australians  to reflect on the success that women in Australia have had; women like myself and Kelly who are blessed to  have the opportunity to stand on the shoulders of those women who have gone before us and actually go  forward and achieve even more. There are, however, as we know, thousands of women around the world  who do not have the opportunities that we here in Australia have. Those women deserve our help and I’m  very pleased with our leader’s announcement today that under the Coalition’s humanitarian settlement  services programme, we will be dedicating a minimum of 1,000 places to women who are at risk. These are  women who live with their children in United Nations camps. They do not have the means, nor do they have  the opportunity to leave those camps and as a developed country like Australia, it is incumbent upon us to  offer those women refuge and that is exactly what we will be doing going forward. We will build on our  commitment to women in the past and we will certainly be offering these women a future.    

 Can I also say, as the Coalition’s spokesperson for the status of women, I have had the privilege of travelling  around Australia and talking to women. The overwhelming feedback that I receive in relation to our paid  parental leave scheme is that women don’t want welfare. They want their success to be celebrated. They  want real time and real money in relation to a paid parental leave scheme and that is what the Coalition  scheme offers. We offer up to $75,000 for the six months. That is real money and real wages because as a  Coalition, we like to celebrate the economic empowerment of women and we like to celebrate success.   

 KELLY O’DWYER:   

 It’s a real delight to be able to welcome both Tony Abbott and Michaelia Cash to Presentation College in my  electorate of Higgins. Presentation College is the second oldest girls school formed in 1873 when seven  nuns came from Ireland to form this particular college and I think it’s very appropriate that we’re here on  International Women’s Day, because International Women’s Day is all about connecting women and  inspiring futures and that is exactly what both Tony and Michaelia have been talking about today. They’ve  been talking about the new policy that we have announced with respect to women at risk overseas and an  increased intake and also our very comprehensive paid parental leave scheme. It’s terrific to be here. I thank  Tony and Michaelia for coming to Higgins.

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Thanks so much, Kelly. Are there any questions?   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, do you think Stephen Smith should apologise to Bruce Kafer?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I think that’s the very least that Stephen Smith should do. I think that he has comprehensively mishandled  this from day one. He spent weeks taking public pot shots at a fine officer who has now been revealed to  have acted in an exemplary fashion at all times. It’s very hard to see how Stephen Smith can continue to  have the kind of relationship with the Defence Forces that a minister should have. So, the very least he  should do is apologise to Commandant Kafer, but really this is not just a question of whether Stephen Smith  has confidence in Commandant Kafer. Does Prime Minister Gillard continue to have confidence in Minister  Smith given the way Minister Smith has so comprehensively botched this issue; has so comprehensively  failed to stand behind a good officer doing a good job under difficult circumstances?   

 QUESTION:   

 Is there a problem with Defence culture?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, bad things happen in all walks of life and I regret to say that sometimes bad things happen in Defence  institutions and they’re inexcusable, they’re unforgivable and when bad things happen, justice should be  done as quickly as possible. I have to say, though, that I am very reluctant to conclude that there is anything  fundamentally wrong with Defence culture. I’d like to think that our Defence Force personnel represent the  best of us, not the worst of us. I think we should support them and work with them to make our Defence  Forces everything that people in the tradition of the ANZACs should be.    

 QUESTION:    

 Do you think there should be a national apology to the victims of the ADFA sex scandal?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I think there should be an apology to Commandant Kafer. It should be immediate. It should be unreserved. It  should be unqualified. It should be made by Minister Smith now and if Minister Smith lacks the decency  and the humility to do it then the Prime Minister should do it.    

 QUESTION:    

 What about the victims? If you were the Prime Minister, would you apologise?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 If bad things have happened, they should be investigated. Where criminal acts have taken place, they should  be prosecuted. Where problems exist in institutions, they should be rectified.    

 QUESTION:    

 You don’t think an apology is necessary?

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, look, I haven’t seen this latest report. I’ll want to study it. I have to say it’s passing strange that the  Government should have chosen to release this other report on the same day that they have chosen to release  the report into the Skype scandal. You know they’ve had the Skype report since December of last year?  They’ve sat on it for three months. Now, they’ve released it along with this other report, plainly to  smokescreen the really deficient conduct of Minister Smith in this matter.    

 QUESTION:    

 Joe Hockey has been quoted in The Sydney Morning Herald today saying the Australian Dollar could reach  $1.25. Do you think that’s possible?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, a floating currency will find a market level. It might be higher, it might not. We support the floating  dollar. We think it’s an important economic reform. The important thing is that we should do whatever we  can as a government to enable Australian businesses to cope with the dollar at whatever level it is and the  best way to do that is to get rid of the toxic carbon tax and what we’ve seen today is yet more evidence of  the way the carbon tax is going to damage jobs and is going to damage the cost of living. Not only do you  pay every time you turn on a light, not only do you pay every time you open your fridge, but its seems every  time you go to hospital you will pay as result of this toxic carbon tax.    

 QUESTION:    

 Ted Baillieu has gone quite hard on industrial relations issues. What can we expect from you?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 What you can expect from us are cautious, careful, responsible reforms that will address the proven  problems in the existing system. We will tackle the flexibility problem, we will tackle the militancy problem  and we will tackle the productivity problem but we will do it in ways that respect the rights of Australians to  a free and fair workplace.    

 QUESTION:    

 Given the current economic climate, do you think there is any chance the Government is going to get the  budget back into surplus by the time it says it will?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I’ll believe it when I see it. It’s very important that the budget get back into surplus as quickly as possible.  Let us never forget that this government has talked about surpluses incessantly. It has never delivered a  single one. Wayne Swan and Julia Gillard are responsible for the four biggest deficits in Australian history -  $167 billion worth of deficit they have racked up. Now, if the Treasurer delivers the currently projected $1.5  billion surplus for the next financial year, at that rate, it will take 100 years of Swanny surpluses to make up  for just four years of Swanny deficits.
