  MEDIA RELEASE 

  August 24, 1991 PARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIA . THE SENATE 

  Embargoed Until 8.00pm est, Saturday 24 August 

  SENATOR JANET POWELL  AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS 

  91/381 

  NO SOLICITING FOR SKILLS MIGRANTS IN TIMES  OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT - DEMOCRATS 

  Speaking at the Annual Conference of the Federation of Ethnic Communities  Councils of Australia (FECCA) in Sydney tonight, Senator Janet Powell, the  Australian Democ1ats spokesperson on Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, was critical  of the Government's continuing to solicit for migrants in the Skills category. 

  "Both Government and Opposition are still holding to the jobs-fodder philosophy,  which may have been defensible in the immediate post 2nd World War period, but  is no longer logical in a country with a burgeoning unemployment problem and a  Government committed through Newstart to retraining for employability,11Senator  Powell said. 

  "There should be a drop in the solicited Skills category to a ceiling of 5,000 -restricted to only those with very special and particularly needed skills, (as opposed  to,the Government's projection of 42,500 for 91-92),11 Senator Powell said. 

  "On the other hand, Democrat policy clearly states that the Family Reunion, Refugee  and Special Humanitarian categories must be given priority," Senator Powell said. 

  "This approach would give us a ceiling of 87,000 people migrating to Australia next  year, as opposed to the Government's projected 111,000. With emigration currently  running between 20,000 and 30,000 annually, the net migration figure I am  proposing would be approximately 62,000,11 Senator Powell said. 

  Senator Powell also called for an immediate increase in the overseas aid budget to  0.42% and for SBS management to reconsider their decision to cut broadcast  programs for 22 languages.
