 Democrats question PM's priorities

 The Australian Democrats have welcomed the prospect of an end to the extended and unnecessary ordeal of the asylum seekers and the Norwegian crew onboard The MV Tampa.

 However, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, said the  Prime  Minister’s  solution  represents  another  embarrassment  for  Australia  and  a waste of taxpayer’s money.

 “The fact that the Australian Government is paying to shift around 300 people who are already in Australia all the way to Nauru, just to assess their claims for asylum, shows what  absurd  lengths  the  Prime  Minister  is  prepared  to  go  to,”  said  Senator  Stott Despoja.

 “This is an island in the Central Pacific, north of the Solomon Islands with an area of 21 square kilometres and a population of just under 12,000.

 “One can only imagine the cost to taxpayers of deploying all these defence personnel and transporting 300 people to a tiny pacific island, especially when you consider that some  of  these  people  may  return  to  Australia  if  their  claims  for  refugee  status  are accepted.

 “Mr Howard must decide whether his priority is for a political solution or a humanitarian solution in the event that this type of situation arises again.”

 Democrats’  Immigration  Spokesperson,  Senator  Andrew Bartlett,  said  Mr  Howard  had shown he was incapable of dealing constructively or logically with a difficult global issue.

 “The  Prime  Minister  has  sacrificed  the  national  interest  for  his  own  narrow  political interests. His behaviour throughout this whole sorry episode has shown a total failure of leadership.

 “The  Democrats’  welcome  the  apparent  resolution  to  this  farcical  impasse,  but  the solution the Prime Minister has come up with makes little sense on a humanitarian or financial basis.

 “It  does  nothing  to  restore  Australia’s  reputation  in  the  eyes  of  the  world,”  concluded Senator Bartlett.
