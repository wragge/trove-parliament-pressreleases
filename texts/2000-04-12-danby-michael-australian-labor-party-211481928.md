  Media Release from the Member for Melbourne Ports   COMPASSION DEFICIT DISORDER - KOSOVARS 

  Bandiana co-patron and Federal Member for Melbourne Ports, Michael Danby, said   today that claims by the Australian Government that it is safe for the Kosovars to return   are wrong. 

  “Immigration Minister. Phillip Ruddock’s ultimatum issued to Kosovar refugees should be   withdrawn and the 146 refugees at Bandiana Safe Haven allowed to apply for protection   visas,” Mr Danby said. 

  “Do the Australian people know that the Howard Government is demanding that 

  Kosovars from Southern Serbia whose homes are occupied by Yugoslav tanks are about   a third of the refugees?” Mr Danby said. 

  “These people have no homes to return to. 

  “When the war with NATO started they left Presevo (Southern Serbia) and fled into   Kosovo, they then fled to Albania and Macedonia. They cannot go home as Mr Ruddock   claims,” Mr Danby said. 

  Mr Danby also condemned the Government’s heartless proposal to split up families. 

  “The Immigration Minister rightly gave protection visas to some of the refugees, such as,   the brothers of the Metaj family, but the government is demanding that one other brother   from the same family be forcibly returned. 

  “Demonstrations by ordinary Australians in Hobart and Albury/Wodonga underlined why   the government should adopt the policy passed yesterday by a majority in the Senate   (ALP, Democrats and Greens) and as announced by Shadow Immigration Minister, Con   Sciacca. 

  “The Australian government should show compassion and flexibility and the remaining   Kosovars should be allowed to stay and make applications for protection visas while they   are here,” Mr Danby said.

  Geneva, 2 ETHNIC ALBANIANS UNDER PRESSURE IN SOUTHERN   March 2000 SERBIA 

  UNHCR expressed alarm Thursday over reports of rising tensions   between Serbs and minority ethnic Albanians living in southern   Serbia, resulting in a noticeable increase in displaced people   arriving in neighboring Kosovo. 

  An estimated 60,000 to 70,000 ethnic Albanians still live in the   Presevo-Bujanovac area along southern Serbia’s provincial border   with Kosovo. There have been increasing reports of instability along   the border in recent weeks, including 

  accounts from displaced 

  Albanians of harassment and intimidation by Serb police and   military. In another incident, an Albanian splinter group active in the   region opened fire on a U.N. vehicle on Tuesday, wounding one   U.N. staff member. 

  UNHCR Special Envoy Dennis McNamara said the volatile situation   in the Presevo area was another example of the precarious   situation of minorities throughout the region. McNamara said the   increasing harassment of Albanians in southern Serbia may also be   linked to recent ethnic unrest in the northern city of Mitrovica. At the   same time, there has been an upsurge in attacks on non-Albanians   - Serbs and Roma - across Kosovo. 

  “Coming on the heels of the recent disturbances in Mitrovica, it may   be no accident that the Albanian minority in southern Serbia is now   feeling under increasing pressure,” he said. “Mitrovica is just the   most visible tip of the iceberg when we look at the overall situation   of minorities in the region. Harassment and intimidation in one place   can bring retaliation and instability in another, feeding into this   continuing cycle of violence and revenge.” 

  Between 5,000 and 6,000 ethnic Albanians are believed to have fled   the Presevo-Bujanovac-Mevedja area of southern Serbia since last   June, many of them entering nearby Kosovo east of Gnjilane.   Although the influx into Kosovo had slowed for a time, UNHCR field   officers in the region are again reporting increasing numbers of new   arrivals. In the fourth week of February, 102 ethnic Albanians from   southern Serbia asked UNHCR in Gnjilane for assistance. 

  The new arrivals report an increase in the Serb military and police   presence in southern Serbia and give consistent accounts of   harassment, beatings, confiscation of houses and apartments,   forced conscription, rape threats and demands for money. Most of   the new arrivals are young families who say the security situation   for ethnic Albanians had deteriorated to such an extent that life had   become intolerable and they could no longer stay in their homes. 

  “This continuing harassment and intimidation of minorities by all   sides has got to stop if the cycle of violence and displacement is   ever going to end,” said McNamara, who is also the Deputy Special   Representative of the Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs in   Kosovo. “And for that to happen we need several things, including   more direct bilateral pressure from governments on the leadership   of both sides. In Kosovo, it also requires continued robust measures   by KFOR and the already over-stretched U.N. police in protecting   minorities; vigorous action In stopping the movement across   provincial borders of armed groups; international judges and   prosecutors to ensure those carrying out these crimes are   punished;
