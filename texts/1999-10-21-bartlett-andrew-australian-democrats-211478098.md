  Coalition 
says "Refugees go home"   
Democrats welcome Senate support for allowing Kosovars to stay

  The Senate today supported   calls not to forcibly deport Kosovar refugees on 
Temporary Safe Haven Visas, and to allow them to stay and apply for 
refugee status.

  "I am delighted that the Senate has supported 
these calls because Immigration Minister Ruddock is saying to the Kosovar 
refugees ‘You’ve passed your use-by date, go home’ whether or 
not they have a home to go to," said Senator Andrew Bartlett the 
Democrats’ immigration spokesperson.

  "The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural 
affairs has made a mockery of refugee week."

  Senator Bartlett was speaking in response to the 
Minister’s statements that the remaining Kosovar refugees in Australia 
could be detained and forcibly deported.

  In response to a question in the House on Monday 
(Oct 18) about the fate of the Kosovars remaining in Australia after 
30 October, Minister Ruddock, said, in part, 

 "It is my intention 
to renew the visas for one month and to review the matters thereafter 
on a regular basis. …..one should not assume that these arrangements 
will go on. Of course, the legal situation is that, if people remain 
in Australia after visas have expired, there is an obligation upon my 
department to detain them and to remove them from Australia."

  The Democrats and Labor have 
consistently urged Minister Ruddock to allow the Kosovar   refugees to stay and apply for Australian residency, 
if they wish. Liberal and Labor Premiers from South Australia, Queensland 
and Tasmania, members of the federal opposition, and the Albanian community 
have also urged Minister Ruddock to reconsider any forced deportation 
of the Kosovar refugees.

  Of the 3,900 Kosovars who were welcomed to Australia 
a few months ago, fewer than 500 are expected to remain here after their 
current visas expire on 30 October. The United States has guaranteed 
permanent residency to their Kosovar refugees.

  "Those that want to remain in Australia and 
have a proven fear of persecution upon their return should be allowed 
to apply for refugee status," said Senator Bartlett.

  "We are talking about a couple of hundred people 
- tiny numbers in the immigration program - but a couple of hundred 
people who have been through unimaginable trauma and now want to make 
Australia home."

  The motion passed by the Senate on Wednesday (Oct 
20) read:

 The Senate notes   
   
(a) Reports of statements by Immigration Minister, Mr Ruddock, that 
Kosovars currently in Australia on Safe Haven visas faced the prospect 
of being placed in immigration detention if they do not leave Australia 
by 30 November 1999; and   
   
(b) Calls by the Australian Democrats, the Federal Opposition, the Premier 
of Tasmania, Mr Bacon and the Premier of South Australia, Mr Olsen for 
those Kosovars who can establish their refugee status under the current 
refugee determination criteria to be allowed to remain in Australia.   
   
(2) Supports the calls by the Federal Opposition, the Australian Democrats, 
the Premier of South Australia, Mr Olsen, and the Premier of Tasmania, 
Mr Bacon, for the Minister for Immigration not to forcibly deport any 
Kosovars currently in Australia on Safe Haven visas   
   
(3) Urges the Government to allow those Kosovar refugees who fear persecution 
should they be returned to Kosovo, to lodge on-shore refugee claims 
under the existing criteria, and to treat such claims on a an individual 
case by case basis.   
   
(4) Supports the introduction of amendments to the safe haven legislation 
to enable on-shore refugee applications to be made by the remaining 
Kosovars.

  "Minister Ruddock is 
clearly not representing the sentiments of most Australians in forcing 
the Kosovar refugees to leave Austr  alia," concluded Senator Bartlett.
