 Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs 

 Media Release 

 New South Wales community business partnerships recognised  

 22/08/2006 

 Six community business partnerships have been recognised for their ongoing commitment  to the New South Wales community as part of the 2006 Prime Minister's Awards for  Excellence in Community Business Partnership.   

 The Minister for Families and Community Services, Mal Brough, on behalf of the Prime  Minister, the Hon John Howard, congratulated all six New South Wales winners for their  commitment to strengthening their local communities.   

 "Partnerships can take on many forms and as a business you don't need to sponsor a wing  of a hospital to be involved. The Awards encompass the essence of community spirit with  governments and businesses working together with communities for a stronger future," Mr  Brough said.   

 "As the winner of the New South Wales Small Business Award, the partnership between  the Waterford Retirement Village Pty Ltd and the Kincumber and District Neighbourhood  Centre promotes healthy eating habits and strengthens community spirit through the  operation of a number of community activities such as the Kincumber Youth Brekky Club. 

 

 "Each of the partnerships delivers better outcomes in areas such as employment,  disadvantaged youth, Indigenous communities, disabilities, health, education, personal  development and the environment.   

 "With this week being National Community Business Partnerships Week I congratulate all  six New South Wales winners of the Prime Minister's Awards for Excellence in Community  Business Partnerships and encourage others to reach out and help their community."   

 The Partnership Week events held around the country this week aim to recognise State  winners, while raising awareness for the benefits of partnerships in the local community. If  a business or community group are interested in forming a partnership and need practical  advice or information, they should contact the Partnerships Secretariat on 1800 359 918  or visit www.partnerships.gov.au   

 A list of the state winners is attached.
