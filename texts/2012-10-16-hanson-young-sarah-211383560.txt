 Media Release   

 Tuesday, 16 October 2012   

 Reprieve for refugees as Govt. heeds Greens  concerns   

 The announcement of a review mechanism for adverse ASIO assessments is the first step to closing a  legal black hole that has swallowed up almost 60 refugees in previous years, the Australian Greens  said.   

 “The Greens called for this and finally the Government has acted,” Greens spokesperson for  immigration Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The review mechanism will give almost 60 refugees, including families with vulnerable children, the  right to challenge their adverse security assessments.   

 “Finally the Government has listened to the Greens and the experts by implementing an  independent review of ASIO decisions, now let’s get those children out of detention.   

 “This legal black hole was keeping genuine refugees locked up in Australia forever, but now they  have the ability to see a summary of the reasons for their adverse assessment and the legal right to  challenge that decision.   

 “The Greens have been pressuring the Government to deliver a reprieve for these refugees and I am  relieved that the Attorney General has accepted our recommendation of an independent review.   

 “The ball is now in the Immigration Minister’s court to ensure genuine refugees, including children,  are not left in indefinite detention.”
