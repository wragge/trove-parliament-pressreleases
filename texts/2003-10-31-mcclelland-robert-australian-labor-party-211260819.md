 Ruddock ducks responsibility for lavish spending on lawyers   

 As  usual,  Attorney-General  Philip  Ruddock  today  tried to duck responsibility  for  the  Howard  Government’s  lavish  spending  on  lawyers  by  blaming  it  on   asylum-seekers.  (“Ruddock says legal bill is asylum seekers’ fault”, Australian  Financial Review)   

 The facts tell a different story.   

 According to a report released by the Howard Government, total spending  on government lawyers was $143.5m in 1998-99, $183.0m in 1999-00, $217.3m  in 2000-01 and $243.0m in 2001-02 - an increase of almost $100m over 4 years.   

 Yet  documents  obtained  by  Labor  under  FOI  reveal  that  spending  by  the  Department of Immigration on litigation was $9m in 1998-99, $9.6m in 1999-00,  $15.9m in 2000-01, and $15.9m in 2001-02 - an increase of $6.9m.   

 In  other  words,  on  the  Government’s  own  figures,  immigration  litigation  accounted for less than 7% of the Howard Government’s increased spending  on lawyers.   

 Moreover,  the  Immigration  Department  made  clear  that  its  own  increased   spending  was  due  to  a  number  of  factors:   “The  significant  increase  in  litigation  expenditure  in  2000/01  over  1999/00  can  be attributed  to  a  26%  increase in litigation matters, the commencement of the Litigation Panel and  the  need  for  new  [legal  services]  providers  to  ‘get  up  to  speed’,  and  the  introduction  of  accrual  accounting  which  required  inclusion  of  a  figure  for   accrued expenditure for the first time.”   

 Like  his  false  claim  that  asylum-seekers  threw  their  children  overboard,  Mr Ruddock’s  excuse  for  the  Howard  Government’s  lavish  spending  on  lawyers simply cannot be believed.   

 Mr Ruddock should stop demonising asylum-seekers and face up to the fact  that the Howard Government now spends more than double on lawyers for  itself than it does on legal aid for battlers.
