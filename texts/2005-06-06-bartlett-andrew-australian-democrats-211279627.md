 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 05/301 MONDAY 6 JUNE 2005   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT                DEPUTY LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS                           GOVT TREATMENT OF CHINESE DEFECTOR MAY NEED TO BE EXAMINED BY SENATE COMMITTEE The Australian Democrats say that it is outrageous that the defector from the Chinese Consulate, Mr Chen Yonglin, is having to be 'in hiding' and 'on the run' while he seeks asylum. Democrat Deputy Leader Andrew Bartlett, said it is a sad indictment on the culture of the Howard Government that foreign officials seeking protection in Australia from a communist dictatorship now have to go into hiding to do so. Senator Bartlett said the Democrats were strongly considering using next week's Senate sittings to establish a Senate inquiry into the multiple failures of the Immigration Department. "These reports of Mr Chen's treatment by Australian Government public servants are certainly ones that warrant proper scrutiny by a Senate Committee.   "The reports show once again that the culture of DIMIA seems to be that an asylum seeker is a bad thing that should be discouraged wherever possible. If someone faces serious persecution from an oppressive government, it is hardly their fault if they try to seek protection for themselves and their family! "It appears the whole Australian notion of our democracy being a source of freedom and a haven from tyranny has disappeared from our Government's mindset. “If DIMIA or DFAT officers notified that Chinese Consulate or Embassy of Mr Chen's actions, that is a disgrace. "Today, we seem more interested in ensuring comfortable relations with dictatorships and a rigid, inflexible migration system than we are with fairness and freedom,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
