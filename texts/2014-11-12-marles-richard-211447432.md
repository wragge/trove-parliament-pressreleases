 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 DAMNING REPORT EXPOSES SCOTT MORRISON’S INCOMPETENCE 

 

 A report released today by the federal information watchdog - the Office of the  Australian Information Commissioner - has found the Department of Immigration  and Border Protection (DIBP) broke the law when it inadvertently posted the details  of nearly 10,000 asylum seekers online.   

 This was an extremely serious breach of the personal information of a vulnerable  group of people and as Minister, Scott Morrison needs to take full responsibility for  this data disaster.   

 In his report on the data bungle, Australia’s Privacy Commissioner, Timothy Pilgrim  found a failure within DIBP to put in place reasonable security safeguards to protect  personal information.   

 The Commissioner also expressed concern about the length of time it took the  Department to detect the cached copy of the data and have it removed.   

 The fact that one of the most significant breaches of privacy in Australia's history  took place on Scott Morrison’s watch highlights his utter incompetence.   

 Scott Morrison should focus on doing his own job properly rather than scheming up  how to seize the portfolio responsibilities of his colleagues.
