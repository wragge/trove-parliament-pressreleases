 ACV Wauri intercepts boat people at Ashmore

 Customs Coastwatch has intercepted another 33 suspected illegal entrants at Ashmore Islands, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone said today.

 The Australian Customs Vessel Wauri, yesterday afternoon detained an 18-metre wooden Indonesian fishing vessel during a patrol in the Ashmore Islands.

 Senator Vanstone said the boat was carrying 26 men, 2 women and 5 children of Middle-Eastern appearance, with three Indonesian crew members.

 ACV Wauri, on long-term patrol in the area, has assisted in the interception of seven boats since July this year. In that time, more than 500 boat people have been apprehended attempting to reach Australia.

 Arrangements are being made to transport the people to the Australian mainland where they will be handed over to Immigration officials.
