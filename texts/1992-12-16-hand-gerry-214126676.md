 LEGISLATION TO LIMIT COMPENSATION CLAIMS FOR BOAT PEOPLE

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, said the Government will tonight  consider legislation which will limit compensation claims  for boat people.

 "I find it outrageous that there could be a risk that the  taxpayer would be expected to foot the bill for a high  compensation payout where custody arrangements have failed  for a technical reason," said Mr Hand.

 Compensation will be payable only to those boat people who  can satisfy a court they have been held in detention  unlawfully.

 The legislation will limit any compensation payable to $1  per day per person for any period of custody found to be  unlawful before the commencement of current detention  legislation in May this year.

 The need for the new legislation arose following a High  Court decision last week which upheld the constitutional  validity of legislation passed in May, giving the Department  the right to detain boat people while their entry  applications are considered, but raised doubts about the  previous custody arrangements of the boat people.

 The doubts turn on the fate of the boat on which the people  arrived in Australia. Where the boat is destroyed or  otherwise unavailable, the court held that custody was 

 unlawful for that period of time.
