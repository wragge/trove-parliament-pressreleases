  Keeping the U:nited Nations Relevant:   International Peace and Security, and Reform 

  Statement by the Hon Alexander Downer, MP, Minister for Foreign Affairs,   to the 55th Session of the General Assembly of lthe United Nations,   New York, 18 September 20010. 

  Introduction 

  Mr President, 

  I join my colleagues in congratulating you on your election as President of the 55th Session of   the General Assembly. 

  I am also delighted to welcome Tuvalu as the 189th member of the United Nations. Australia   has long-standing and very friendly relations with Tuvalu, and we have worked closely together   as members of the South Pacific Forum and the Commonwealth. We are pleased that Tuvalu is   now a member of the UN, and look forward to new opportunities to work together for the UN’s   common goals of peace and development. 

  Mr President, we meet today just after the largest number of heads of state and government in   history gathered for the Millenniulm Summit. While the Summit touched on the multitude of   problems facing the world at the start of a new century, a theme common to many speeches was   the need for the United Nations to reform so as to meet the challenges of the era: the challenges   of securing peace, of fighting poverty and of empowering and liberating oppressed peoples. 

  I want to respond to those calls for reform in my remarks to the Assembly today. 

  Without continuing commitment to refomn, the United Nations - like any organisation - cannot   expect to keep up with rapid change in the contemporary international environment. In the   absence of change and adaptation, the organisation will wither as the nations of the world bypass   it in favour of institutions and mechanisms that are more relevant to their needs. 

  Australians believe the most fundamental task of the organisation - and the very reason for its   creation at the end of the Second World War - is the maintenance of international peace and   security. In. recent years we have seen the United Nations perform at both ends of the spectrum   of relevance and effectiveness: at a low point in addressing problems in Rwanda or KLosovo, and   at a high point in the resolution of conflict in East Timor. 

  I am a strong advocate of an active role for the United Nations in the restoration and preservation   of international peace and security, especially in situations whlere there may be imminent danger   of humanitarian catastrophe. Appropriate action by the United Nations in these circumstances   does more than perhaps anything else to demonstrate the continuing relevance of this   organisation to an often sceptical international public.

  Continuing commitment to UN reform 

  Today I want to focus attention on four aspects of reform within the UN system: reform of the   Security Council, electoral group reconfiguration, reform of peacekeeping, and reform of the   human rights treaty committee system. It is our view that progress in each of these areas must be   achieved toI enable the UN to deliver results and ensure its relevance and effectiveness. 

  Security Council Reform 

  Reform ancl expansion of the 

  Security Council is driven by two fundamental, interrelated   imperatives: the need to restore the representative nature of the Council by reconfiguring its   compositio:n to reflect the size and. diversity of contemporary UN membership, and the need to   enhance the Council’s credibility, iauthority and legitimacy. 

  The Australian Government’s view has long been that expansion in both categories of   membership is needed to restore balance and equity to the composition of the Council. 

  New permanent seats should be assumed by the under-represented developing regions of the   world. New permanent seats should also be allocated to the major industrialised powers best   able to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. Equally importantly,   other members of the UN should be given the opportunity to clontribute directly to the work of   the Council through periodic participation as elected members. Expansion of non-permanent   membership would enhance the representative nature of the Council, enabling it to act genuinely   on behalf of the whole membership. 

  Australia has long voiced concerns about the veto and continues to argue that there must be   limitations on its use. Of course, all permanent members of the Council, old and new, must   remain accountable for their performance, and to this end any new arrangements for the Council   should be reviewed after ten or fifteen years. 

  Regrettably, discussion on Security Council reform has failed to reach agreement on a package of   reforms in the six years since the Open Ended Working Group was established. The impasse is   disappointing, and I hope that this session will give new impetus to the reform effort. It is clear   from statements at the Millennium Summit, and during this debate, that there is strong support   for reform. Renewed commitment and flexibility is needed from all sides. 

  Electoral group reconfiguration 

  In the recent debate about UN reform, one key element has largely been missing. I refer to the   UN electoral groups. 

  The electoral groups were established to ensure that there was fair and equitable representation   on UN bodiles, so that all members who wanted to make a contribution to UN decision-making   would have an opportunity to do so. Now that three decades heave passed since the formalisation   of the present groups, it is timely that we focus on their relevance to present and future   geopolitical realities. 

  The current group system reflects the geopolitics of the 1960s. Since that time, more than sixty   nations have joined the UN, leading to significant disparities between the size of groupings and   an inadequate level of representation for some sub-regions. In addition, the original rationale for 

  4. 

  the configuration of the electoral groups has eroded, creating dissonance with the way many   member states organise themselves politically and electorally. 

  The previous realignment of groups in 1963 was a long and difficult process impelled by   significant changes in the UN system after the entry of many newly independent states from   Africa and ,4sia. I recognise that group reconfiguration is no easy matter, and accept that change   now will be similarly complex. For that very reason we should delay no longer in commencing a   serious debate of these issues. 

  While there are many possible configurations for revised electoral groupings, and many   sensitivities around altering the status quo, the dramatic global changes since the current system   came into force have created historic anornalies that cry out to be redressed. Australia looks   forward to working with others to achieve that goal. 

  Treaty committee review and treaty body reform 

  As part of the government’s commitment to a strong and relevant United Nations, Australia   recently completed a review of the United. Nations human rights committee system, with the   objective of improving its effectivieness. The review proceedeld from our Government’s   commitment to the international promotion and protection of human rights, and a firm belief that   the UN has a central role to play. 

  Australia has a proud human right,s record and we take our international rights and obligations   seriously. We are party to both Human Rights covenants and 

  1.0 the four conventions. Within 

  Australia, which has a strong civil society, human rights are protected by a range of key civil and   political mechanisms, including a strong democratic tradition, our Constitution, an independent   judiciary, a free press, and wide-ranging anti-discrimination legislation. Internationally,   Australia is a strong proponent of the universal application of human rights standards, committed 

  to continued support for international human rights protection. 

  We are concerned that the committees, established to monitor international compliance with   human rights treaties, are losing credibility and effectiveness because of the way they operate. It   is important also that the international protection system work efficiently and effectively so that   democratic countries such as Australia, which have a proud record of extending generous   humanitarian assistance, can continue to have the confidence and support of their own domestic   constituenc:ies for such humanitarian protection. 

  Australia’s review found that the clommittees need to adopt a more consistent approach to their   role, and understand the pitfalls of simply accepting without analysis the submissions put before   them by non-government organisations. It is important that adequate recognition be given to the   role and views of governments which are democratically elected and which take their treaty   commitments and reporting obligations seriously. The committees need also to be more   balanced and strategic about targeting key human rights offenders and avoid unfairly .focusing   their criticism on countries with good human rights records. 

  For some years now Australia has, together with a number of other countries including Canada,   New Zealand and Norway, been advocating reform of the treaty committees. Most recently, the   Australian Mission to the United Nations .in Geneva hosted a meeting of around 20 countries to   discuss treaty committee reform. The United Nations itself has also recognised the ne:ed for 

  5. 

  reform of the treaty committee system, and Australia has been fully supportive of these   international reform efforts. 

  Australia intends now to broaden such efforts by spearheading a high-level diplomatic initiative   to garner broad support for reforms to improve the functioning of the committees and   professionalise their operations. Reforms could include the provision of adequate resources to   the human rights treaty committees, improvements to their working methods, standardised rules   of procedure when considering states’ reports, and better consultation between the committees   themselves to coordinate reporting timetables and to facilitate cooperative work on reform issues.   But Australia does not have a monopoly on good ideas, and we want to work closely lwith UN   officials and with like-minded countries to make the treaty committee system work more   effectively for the good of all member states and for the protection of human rights. 

  We will therefore be talking widely with others to develop concrete proposals for reform. We   will raise these issues in the General Assembly, at the Commission on Human Rights and in   other appropriate meetings. We also think that the regular meetings of states parties to the six   human rights treaties should discuss reform issues and provide: guidance to the respective   committees on their working methLods. 

  Australia wants to maximise the effectiveness of the treaty bodies. We will not shy away from   our responsibilities, but will press for the reforms that are needed to make the system work well   and achieve its objectives. If reform doesn’t occur, the committee system will increasingly be   ignored and made redundant. That would be a setback for the cause of human rights. 

  Peacekeeping and international ,security 

  I turn now to the matter of peacekeeping and the maintenance of international security. 

  Peacekeeping and peace operations 

  Australia has a long and honourable tradition as a participant in UN peacekeeping operations,   most recently in East Timor. And I believe that the strength of our commitment is reflected in   the recent appointment by the Secretary-General of Australian Major-General Tim Ford as his   military adviser. 

  The experience of the 1990s has clearly shown that the UN’s ability to meet an expanding and   increasingly complex range of peacekeeping demands is under strain. The decade witnessed   some important successes in peacekeeping - notably East Timor, but also some smaller,   unheralded operations. But it also saw some tragic failures, the costs of which were often   measured in human lives. 

  I commend the Secretary-General’s commitment to blunt scrutiny and review of the UN’s   performance:, including the reports on Srebrenica and Rwanda. We particularly commend his   initiative in convening the Brahimi Panel on UN Peace Operations. The Brahimi Report is a   landmark document setting out a blueprint for modemising the UN’s peacekeeping and related   functions. We must move expeditiously to consider its recommendations. 

  Let me highlight briefly five points that, in Australia’s view, are among the most significant   lessons of recent experiences. 

  6. 

  First, military intervention must be used only as a last resort. ,411 efforts must be made to find   peaceful solutions. In this context, we welcome the Brahimi Report’s emphasis on preventive   action and peace-building. 

  Second, wh,ere the UN is deployed, there must be a peace to keep. There are real dangers in   sending troops indefinitely into harm’s way in the absence of a. clear peace plan and re.asonable   prospects for achieving it. Disputing parties must be committed to peace, and must be held   accountable for their actions. 

  Third, peace operations must have: a mandate from the Security Council that is appropriate to the   job they are: being asked to do. If the environment is hostile, 

  tlhey must be appropriately 

  equipped and able to project credilble force. 

  Fourth, deployment must take place quickly once a decision is taken by the Security Council.   Delays can lead to the further deterioration of a situation, and can cost lives. The Bralhimi Report   offers a nurnber of useful ideas to speed deployment which merit careful consideration. 

  Fifth, UN peace operations must hLave a clear exit strategy. This is linked in particular to the   clarity of Council mandates: as the Brahixni Report rightly stresses, mandates must be clear,   credible and achievable. It is also linked to the efficacy of accompanying peace proce:sses and   peacebuilding efforts. 

  We welcome the attention given to these issues in the Brahimi Report. We also support the point   that the UN must be given the resources it needs to carry out the demands that we make of it.   There is no question that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations needs to be strengthened   and reformed. Ultimately, it is our responsibility, as member states, to support a stronger and   more effective UN peacekeeping capacity. This includes placing the financing of peacekeeping   on a surer footing and paying our assessed contributions in full and on time. 

  East Timor 

  Mr President, I can not conclude without referring to the question of East Timor. 

  When I addressed this Assembly one year ago, East Timor was in the throes of the most   appalling violence at the hands of a brutal and lawless militia. Since then important progress has   been made in restoring security and building the foundations of an independent East Timor.   Australia pays tribute to the men and women of INTERFET and of UNTAET for th(eir   commitment and - in too many cases - their sacrifice. 

  East Timor faces a long and difficult path to peace and prosperity. Australia is playing a major   role in the territory’s reconstruction, through the UN and other organisations as well as   bilaterally. We are committed for the long term to helping the East Timorese build thleir   emerging nation - not only for the benefit of the East Timorese but in the interests of stability and   security in our region. 

  Regrettably, the pro-integration militia continue to pose a major threat to security and stability.   Intimidation and violence against Timorese refugees and humanitarian aid personnel in the   camps on the East-West Timor border must be halted. The killing of UNHCR workers earlier   this month deserves the world’s strongest condemnation. Australia reiterates its call on Indonesia 

  7. 

  to fulfil its responsibility to provide effective security in West Timor, including by bringing an   end to militia activity, bringing to justice those responsible for crimes, creating the necessary   conditions for the return of UNHCR, and resolving the refugee situation. We urge the   Indonesian #authorities to take all possible steps in this direction, including cooperating with the   proposed Security Council mission. 

  Conclusion - keeping the UN relevant 

  Mr President, if the United Nations is to remain relevant and credible, it must work on its   strengths and maintain a strong commitment to a continuing program of reform and renewal.   The challenges that face the organisation are formidable, but not insurmountable. The need for   change is clear and urgent, but I believe that it is not beyond the ingenuity and good will of our   generation to emulate our predecessors in grasping the reform .nettle. 

  At the Millennium Summit, the world’s leaders highlighted the need for the United Nations to   meet the challenges of the new century. Let us heed their call, and work together with renewed   determination and commitment to make this organisation more: representative, and much more   effective.
