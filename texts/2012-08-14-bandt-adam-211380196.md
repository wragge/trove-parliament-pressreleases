 Comment from Greens Deputy Leader Adam Bandt   

 Adam Bandt will move an amendment to the Government’s migration bill this afternoon.   

 The amendment will restrict detention time on Nauru and other offshore detention centres  to one year.   

 “Under John Howard’s Pacific Solution, refugees were detained on Nauru for many years, in  some cases as long as 4 years.”   

 “Under the new Pacific Solution, the Prime Minister has refused to guarantee that refugees  won’t be detained in island prisons for as long as, or even longer than, under John Howard.”   

 “The Greens’ amendment will ensure that refugees will not face indefinite detention in an  island prison.”
