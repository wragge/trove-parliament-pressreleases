 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 JOINT STATEMENT BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THE HON SIMON CREAN MP SHADOW MINISTER FOR POPULATION AND IMMIGRATION JULIA GILLARD MP

 Protecting Australia and Protecting the Australian Way  Asylum Seekers and Refugees

 Labor will better protect our borders while treating asylum seekers decently.

 The number one priority of the Australian Government is to protect our national security and our borders.

 Treating asylum seekers decently does not come at the expense of national security and under the proposal taken to Caucus today, Labor will better protect Australia’s borders through:

 â¢ An Australian Coastguard;

 â¢ A ‘Green Card’ to crack down on illegal workers;

 â¢ Tougher policing and harsher penalties to smash people smuggling rings;

 â¢ Improved security arrangements at our airports and ports; and

 â¢ Treating asylum seekers who arrive by air in the same way as those who arrive by sea.

 Mandatory detention will continue, but:

 â¢ Children will be released from behind the razor wire, and the ‘Pacific Solution’ scrapped;

 â¢ Woomera will be closed;

 â¢ Processing of those in detention will be speeded up with 90% of refugee claims determined in 90 days;

 â¢ Those with claims of merit who pose no risks will be able to live in supervised hostel style accommodation;

 â¢ Temporary Protection Visas will not continue indefinitely;

 2

 â¢ Labor will increase funding to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and boost aid to countries that are the source of or transit countries for asylum seekers; and

 â¢ Returned asylum seekers will be monitored to ensure they are not being persecuted.

 Better Protecting Australia

 Labor announced last week we will better protect Australia’s borders with a $600 million Australian Coastguard, a cop on the beat 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

 Today we are putting forward five additional new important steps to better protect Australia.

 1. A US style Green Card to crack down on illegal workers and ensure they are not stealing Australian jobs and undermining pay and conditions. Anyone working here must have either an Australian Tax File Number (TFN) or a Green Card. Anyone employing someone without a Green Card or TFN will face prosecution..

 2. Onshore and offshore people smuggling rings will be smashed through tougher policing including stationing more Australian Federal Police (AFP) officers in Indonesia.

 3. Harsher penalties, including 20 year gaol terms and million dollar fines, for people smugglers.

 4. Better protecting our airports and seaports by strengthening intelligence collection at airports and ensuring that foreign ship operators are not given open access to our coastal shipping trade.

 5. Treating asylum seekers who arrive by air in the same way as those who arrive by sea.  There are an estimated 60,000 people in Australia who have overstayed or breached their visas. Half are working illegally. Labor will crack down on all people who have breached their visas.

 Treating Asylum Seekers with Decency

 Labor will free children from behind the razor wire, close Woomera, return detention centre management to the public sector, and lift the shroud of secrecy around detention centres through greater media access and the involvement of independent medical professionals.

 Mandatory detention must be retained to protect Australia from health and security risks and to ensure refugee claims can be dealt with efficiently and those whose claims are rejected removed.  Mandatory detention must be for the speedy and humane processing of asylum seekers, not punishment.

 Asylum seekers will be treated decently through:

 1. Ending the so-called ‘Pacific Solution’, because it is costly, unsustainable and wrong as a matter of principle.

 2. A fast, fair and transparent processing regime on Christmas Island and on mainland Australia that determines 90% of refugee claims in 90

 3

 days.  Genuine refugees will be quickly identified and released while illegal immigrants will be quickly returned.

 3. Better health and ASIO security checks.

 4. Allowing those found likely to be refugees and who have been given ASIO and health clearances and pose no risk to the community to live in supervised hostel style accommodation.  Christmas Island will have a supervised hostel.  Other supervised hostels will only be located in regional communities that bid to have one.

 5. An independent Inspector-General of Detention, to monitor detention conditions and resolve complaints.

 6. An expert committee that will review any case in which a person is detained for more than 90 days.

 7. Allowing refugees to access settlement services like English language training and the Job Network.

 There are refugees in Australia who, under current laws, may be here a lifetime but will never be eligible for family reunion.  This system of keeping Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) holders in permanent limbo will be abolished. At the expiry of their visa, TPV holders will be reassessed, and those still found to be refugees given the opportunity to apply for a permanent visa and family reunion. This will prevent them resorting to people smugglers to try to reunite their families.

 Refugees will be encouraged to settle in regional Australia, but only where they will be welcomed and are needed.  Communities that want to increase their population through having refugees settle will be able to do so through Labor’s regional settlement plan and will receive targeted resources to assist them in doing so.

 Protecting Australia Through World’s Best Processing

 Australia must be protected from unauthorised boat arrivals by leading the way in destroying the international market for people smugglers. This will involve:

 1. Maintaining the excision of Christmas Island from the Migration Zone. Christmas Island will be the prime asylum seeker processing and detention facility.

 2. Monitoring the return of failed asylum seekers to ensure they are not persecuted.

 3. Increasing funding to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to $25 million per annum in order to better assist those who live, and too often die, in refugee camps overseas.

 4. Boosting aid to address the issues that cause people to flee their homelands - poverty, natural disasters, conflict and environmental degradation.

 5. Increasing aid to countries of first asylum to facilitate the development of a system of return of asylum seekers.

 Labor will protect Australia and protect the Australian way by securing our borders, while dealing with unauthorised arrivals with decency.
