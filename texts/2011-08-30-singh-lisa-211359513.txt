 Sewing circle stitches up project to improve social cohesion   

 Newly arrived migrants and refugees in southern Tasmanian will benefit from a $60 000 grant to a  women’s sewing group in the latest round of funding under the 2011-12 Settlement Grants  Program, the Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Kate Lundy,  announced in Hobart today.    

 Tasmanian Federal Senators, Carol Brown and Lisa Singh, welcomed the federal funding to assist  new arrivals successfully settle in the Hobart community.     

 “The Stitch project is a sewing and craft group for women from different backgrounds that aims to  reduce social isolation and help newly arrived, mainly refugee and humanitarian women aquire the  life skills they need in Australia and access mainstream services,” Senator Carol Brown said.    

 Senator Lisa Singh said the project would be delivered by Centacare, a community organisation  making a significant contribution to the successful settlement of newly arrived migrants and  refugees in Tasmania.    

 “Women currently participating in the Stitch project are from a diverse range of countries including  Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Burundi and Burma,” Senator Lisa Singh  said.    

 “This grant will enable those women to continue to meet, share experiences, practise speaking  English and form friendships and connections in the Australian community, which are all very  effective ways of reducing social isolation and connecting with the wider community in which they  live.”    

 From 1 July 2011, a total of 179 new projects delivered through 148 organisations have been  funded under the government's Settlement Grants Program, which aims to help refugees and  migrants become self-reliant, contribute to the national economy, and acquire crucial skills and  knowledge about life in Australia.    

 A total of $1.1 million has been allocated to Tasmanian agencies to help refugees and migrants  settle into their new communities.    

 “Many new arrivals face significant challenges settling into the community due low levels of English  literacy, years spent in refugee camps, and suffering from past experiences of torture and trauma,”  Senator Lundy said.
