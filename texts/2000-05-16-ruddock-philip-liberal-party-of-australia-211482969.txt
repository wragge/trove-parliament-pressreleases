 Refugee Resettlement Advisory Council MPS 053/2000

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today announced the commencement of a new term for the Refugee Resettlement Advisory Council.

 "The Refugee Resettlement Advisory Council will continue to advise me on the settlement of refugees, humanitarian entrants and migrants, focussing on the appropriateness and adequacy of Commonwealth services, especially for refugees," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Renewing the Council's term reflects the priority the Government gives to the successful settlement of refugees and humanitarian entrants, and to continuing community consultation in the settlement process."

 "Members attend my annual consultations to hear concerns about, and suggestions for improving, the settlement services provided to refugees and humanitarian entrants. This is just one of the ways in which the council facilitates ongoing dialogue with the community."

 The Council will advise the Minister on settlement priorities within the National Integrated Settlement Strategy. Its work will complement the broader work and focus of the new Council for Multicultural Australia, the membership of which will be announced in the near future.

 "I am very pleased that Major General Warren Glenny AO, has agreed to continue to chair the Council. As Chief Executive Officer of Austcare, he brings valuable expertise to the Council," Mr Ruddock said.

 Other members of the Council are:

 Dr Mohammed Taha Alsalami Mr Paris Aristotle

 Mrs Ellen Goodman Ms Carmel Guerra Mr Kevin Liston Ms Michelle My Nguyen Ms Margaret Piper Mr Gerald Searle Rev Eileen Thomson

 "The council members bring a wide range of experiences, often from working directly with refugees and migrants," Mr Ruddock said.

 The Minister acknowledged the contribution of the nine existing members who have agreed to renew their term and also welcomed the new addition to the Council, Ms Michelle My Nguyen.

 "Ms Nguyen is an active member of the Vietnamese community and several community and youth organisations. Her appointment will ensure that ethnic youth issues continue to form a part of Council's considerations," Mr Ruddock said.
