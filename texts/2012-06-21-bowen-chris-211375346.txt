 Chris Bowen MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 More Abbott boats as destructive negativity  continues  Thursday, 21 June 2012 

 Joint media release with Chris Bowen MP - Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship and Jason Clare MP - Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for  Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel. 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and the Minister for  Home Affairs, Jason Clare MP, have called on Tony Abbott to stand up and allow for  offshore processing after another two boats arrived today. 

 The latest boat is the 57th since the Coalition rejected compromise and the offer to  work together with the government to implement offshore processing. 

 Mr Bowen said despite the increase in arrivals and more people risking their lives at  sea, Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison continued to turn the other cheek. 

 'Mr Abbott and Mr Morrison are quite happy to score cheap political points wherever  they can, but their destructive negativity means people continue to risk their lives on  dangerous boats,' Mr Bowen said. 

 'They need to reverse their position on offshore processing legislation, stop saying  'no' and put the national interest ahead of their personal political interest.' 

 The government has been prepared to work with the Coalition to see offshore  processing legislation pass through the Parliament, even offering to reintroduce a  Nauru processing centre - Tony Abbott's own policy. 

 Mr Clare said it was time the Opposition stopped voting no to offshore processing. 

 'Let's remember what this is all about - 200 people died off the coast of Indonesia  and another 11 died off the coast of Malaysia,' Mr Clare said. 

 'If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must stop saying 'no' and pass  our legislation to allow asylum seekers to be processed offshore in Malaysia and  Nauru.'
