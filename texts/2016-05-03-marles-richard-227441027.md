 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP 

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO    

 

 CRITICALLY INJURED ASYLUM SEEKER      

 Reports that a 21 year-old female asylum seeker is in a critical condition  following injuries sustained during an incident on Nauru are deeply distressing.    

 That this is the second incident of this kind to take place within a week is a clear  sign there is something wrong with how the Australian Government is managing  its offshore processing network.    

 It is clear that the Turnbull Governmentâ€™s policy, focused only on deterrence with  no feasible pathway to permanent migration in a resettlement country is leaving  people desperate and without hope.    

 Mr Turnbull must urgently seek a viable agreement to resolve the fate of people  on Manus Island and Nauru.    

 Labor continues to call on Mr Turnbull to urgently secure a credible third country  arrangement that offers refugees a viable long term settlement future.
