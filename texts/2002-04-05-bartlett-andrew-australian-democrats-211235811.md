 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats Immigration Spokesperson

 5 April 2002  MEDIA RELEASE                          02/157

 Government puts children at risk, not asylum seekers  

 The Senate hearing into the Children Overboard incident heard today that the Government policy of turning asylum seekers away is directly responsible for the increase in hostile incidents involving the Navy and unauthorised entrants.  

 Rear Admiral Geoffrey Smith told the Inquiry that there was “no doubt the lack of incidents prior to operation RELEX could be attributed to the change in Government policy coincident with the arrival of the TAMPA”.

 In a Minute tabled in the Inquiry, Rear Admiral Smith, stated that the change in Government policy “has proven to be confrontational and resulted in the numerous hostile threats and violent actions ….. that had not previously taken place”.  

 Australian Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett said, “It is the Government’s policy of preventing boats from landing which is putting children at risk ”.

 Information provided to the Inquiry shows that virtually all of the 12 Suspected Illegal Entry Vessels intercepted were significantly overcrowded, at sea for prolonged periods and contained many children.

 Over 2200 people were on board the various vessels, including around 400 children, some of them infants.  

 “Out of all of these, on just one occasion a child was dropped in the water from a boat and this child was immediately rescued by an asylum seeker and returned to the boat,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “One incident by one person out of 2200 hardly constitutes a pattern of behaviour of harming children as the Government continues to suggest.

 “By far the biggest threat to the safety of children is the Government’s policy which prevents the Navy from being able to get people off the unsafe boats and onto land.  

 “Other claims regarding threats to children and others, completely ignore the extreme situations asylum seekers have found themselves in, including overcrowded, unsafe vessels at sea for prolonged periods being confronted by Navy vessels.  

 “This change in government policy had increased the stress placed on asylum seekers and the desperation they felt in trying to seek asylum.  

 “The Navy has been placed into the intolerable position of turning desperate people away by force placing their lives and health in danger by doing so. Faced with this desperate people take the only measures open to them to ensure they will be taken to safety.  

 “Government attempts to demonise asylum seekers cannot take away the fact that it is their policy which places not only women and children in danger,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
