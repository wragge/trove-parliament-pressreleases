 Joanna Gash M.P Press Releases

 I'LL TAKE THEM DOWN, JO!

 Its been a number of weeks since the Refugee Action Group first put up their signs for the rally and since then MP Joanna Gash has been trying to get the group to take them down. "At the rally at Bomaderry I made the point of saying that not only were they put up illegally, but that the group had an obligation to remove them.

 "I asked Jo Coghlan the organiser to make sure every effort was made for her members to take them down. "My name appears on the poster and I really don't want people to associate me with illegal signage. "I certainly didn't give my permission to do that and I would have expected the same level of enthusiasm was shown taking them down as putting them up.
