 LABOR DODGES TOUGH DECISONS ON MIGRATION AND BOATS 

 Mr Scott Morrison MP  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 The Rudd Government has dodged the tough decisions on migration reform by refusing to address the declining 

 proportion of skills migration to Australia and their failures on border protection, Shadow Minister for Immigration 

 and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today.  

 “This year the number of people migrating to Australia under the family program will increase by more than 20% 

 from the levels set by the Coalition. At the same time the proportion of skilled migration will fall below two thirds of 

 our total intake,” Mr Morrison said.  

 “The Rudd Government is playing musical chairs with skilled migration, but failing to guarantee that a larger 

 proportion of our annual intake in the future will be dedicated to skills migration,” he said.  

 “Even worse, the Government continues to ignore their failures on border protection that have seen more than 

 3,600 people arrive illegally on 79 boats since Labor changed the laws on protection visas.  

 “Labor is more interested in stopping skilled migrants who are coming to pay tax than stopping boats illegally 

 arriving in Australian waters.  

 “Just today it has been revealed that Labor has once again compromised our off shore processing system by 

 bringing asylum seekers who had illegally arrived in Australian waters directly to the mainland, before their 

 asylum claims have been tested.  

 “The Rudd Government’s actions totally undermine the effectiveness of our off shore processing as a deterrent to 

 people smugglers. Once again, the Rudd Government has gone the soft option on boat arrivals.  

 “Labor has very poor form on skilled migration. Last time Labor was in Government skilled migration fell to less 

 than 30% of our annual migration programme. It took 12 years for the Coalition to rebuild this proportion to about 

 70%.  

 “If Labor was committed to skilled migration, they would guarantee that the future intake will stay above at least 

 two thirds. This requires some hard decision on the family programme, and tightening up on the claims in this 

 area.  

 “The Rudd Government says they want to crack down on skilled migrants, 97% of who had jobs and paid taxes 

 under the Coalition, while allowing the family programme to blow out year on year, without so much of a whisper 

 of reform.  

 “While we will wait to see the details of Labor’s proposals it is already clear that there will be many students who 

 will be caught between a rock and a hard place, while private colleges, especially in Victoria will come under 

 significant pressure, with many jobs at stake.  

 “How Labor manages the transition will be the test. At risk is our international reputation as a desired destination 

 for skilled migration and the many jobs at stake in the private education sector,” Mr Morrison said.
