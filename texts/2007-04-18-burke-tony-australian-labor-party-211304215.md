 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, PERTH  E&OE-PROOF ONLY   

 18 APRIL 2007  

 

 Subject: Asylum seekers; Resources Reference Group     

 

 BURKE:  I was astonished to hear the Government’s announcement this morning  regarding the deal with the United States.  Five years ago you never would have found  John Howard putting forward a plan that provided an incentive for people-smuggling  operations but that is exactly what this plan offers.   

 For me there is no argument, Australia is the best country in the world.  That is not a  view universally held and it’s certainly the case that in the refugee camps in the world,  there is no greater prize than being able to make it to the United States.  What John  Howard is doing is sending a message to the world that says if you can get a people-smuggler to get you as far as Christmas Island then John Howard will pick up the fare to 

 New York.    

 It is the most extraordinary change in refugee policy you could imagine.  We’re  providing the greatest incentive there ever could be - a trip and residence in the United  States - for people who arrive in people-smuggling operations off the coast of Christmas  Island.   

 Five years ago you never, never would have seen John Howard put forward a policy like  this.   

 JOURNALIST:  So do you think there is some hidden agenda here?   

 BURKE:  I think the sense of balance, any common sense judgement that John Howard  used to have, he doesn’t exercise anymore. He’s not the same bloke that he used to be  and policies like this are the glaring example of it.  I mean, this is the opposite of  everything he used to say he would deliver in public policy.   

 JOURNALIST:  What would be in it for both countries to sign such an agreement? 

 

 BURKE:  I can understand from the perspective of the United States that they’re wanting  to quite directly send a message to Cuba that the Cubans will not be settled in the United  States but the message works very differently for them than it works from Australia’s  perspective. From Australia’s perspective we have to deal with the fact that a small  number of people who try by boat to arrive unauthorised in Australia.  A very large  number of people tried to do the same in the United States.    

 No matter how much we love our country, and I do, they are a greater prize for people  seeking a new country, than we are.    

 JOURNALIST:  (Inaudible)   

 BURKE:  I can’t understand it.  I can’t understand it and I’m not going to try to see  inside the mind of John Howard.  All I can guarantee is that it is something that you  never would have seen from him five years ago.   

 JOURNALIST:  Under this plan, and to what your understanding is, what would  happen?  Would the Cuban asylum seekers be housed in the communities across  Australia or would they be on offshore detention centres?  What would happen there?   

 BURKE: The language in today’s papers refers to resettlement.  Resettlement doesn’t  mean continued indefinite detention.  Resettlement means some of them would live in the  United States and some of the ones provided to us from the United States would live in  Australia.    

 I mean the experience so far of Nauru has been that about thirty nine people were settled  in North America or Europe and more than a thousand were resettled in Australia or New  Zealand. The concept of saying these individuals will never come here has failed but we  now move to a new system where people who don’t get to settle here will actually be  resettled somewhere that is a greater incentive. A country that is generally viewed in the  refugee camps around the world as the best prize you can win.   

 JOURNALIST:  These Cubans seeking asylum in America, do you think it will be a  disincentive for them having the threat of being shipped out to Australia?    

 BURKE:  I don’t know.  I presume that’s the message that the United States wants to  send. I just don’t think it plays the same way for them as it plays for us. I would love to  think around the world everyone viewed Australia as the best possible destination on the  planet. The truth is the United States is the country that is viewed as the best place for  resettlement if you can get there and John Howard’s now providing the means for people  to get there.    

 This will not result in fewer boats. If anything it will result in more.   

 JOURNALIST:  Times are tough in Cuba it might be (inaudible) for people who are  happy to start a better life in Australia.   

 BURKE:  And we do as a nation and this is one area I am not critical of the Government  on - the issue of what we do with providing people who are offshore with the chance of  resettlement in Australia.  The government has that offshore program and there is no  reason for Cuba to necessarily be excluded from it. That part of it isn’t a policy change  from what we already do.    

 The significant change is the public message that if you arrive in a people smuggling  operation it is a fast track method to make it to the United States.   

 JOURNALIST:  The Federal Government says it is just formalising arrangements that  they had.  I wasn’t aware that there was such a (inaudible)   

 BURKE:  This is brand new.  When they had people on Nauru, as I said, thirty nine were  settled across Canada and Europe and none went to the United States. What we are seeing  today is new and it holds a very real risk that more people will see themselves putting  their lives at risks on the high seas, on the way to Christmas Island because John Howard  has just given people smugglers a brand new market.   

 JOURNALIST:  Like giving them a green card to the US.   

 BURKE:  That’s right.   

 JOURNALIST:  Mr Burke just on another issue briefly. Yesterday you were announced  as a member of Federal Labor’s committee into AWA’S in the resources sector. What do  you think will replace them, if Labor is saying there won’t be any individual contracts on  mine sites, what do you think will replace them then?  What is the alternative?   

 BURKE:  The committee is the Resources Reference Group. Julia Gillard is a member of  it and she deals with the AWA section of that. There is also significant relevance to skills  shortages in the mining sector and the immigration program is part of meeting that.  So  it’s on issues like permanent skills migration and the 457 visa that will be my key  contribution to that Reference Group.   

 JOURNALIST: But this committee, which you are a member of, it’s going to be facing  challenging times because a vast majority of WA mine workers are on AWAs.   

 BURKE: The committee has been set up because we want to make sure that we do  continue with very high levels of productivity.  We want to make sure that we invest for  the next generation and the next ten years and long term productivity. That’s why the  shadow ministers who have the different areas to bring to the table of relevance to the 

 mining sector have been put on that.  Julia Gillard is there to be making sure that she is  doing the consultation on industrial relations.  For me it is very much the immigration  issues.  

 

 JOURNALIST: However the key question will be, which mine workers will certainly be  asking is, if they can’t continue on AWAs under a Federal Labor Government, what’s the  alternative?   

 BURKE:  Julia Gillard is available in Perth today so she is here and I’m not going to  cross over to areas where she will be able to give answers way beyond what I can. What I  can say though is I think if you don’t see the importance to the mining sector of  immigration then we are missing a big driver of productivity. I was with Minerals  Council only on Monday and had long discussions there and the industrial relations part  of it is not their only concern.  They have been hit badly by the skills shortage and  making sure that we have a carefully tailored immigration program through both  temporary and permanent visas has to be part of that solution and that’s why I have been  put in the reference group.   

 ENDS.
