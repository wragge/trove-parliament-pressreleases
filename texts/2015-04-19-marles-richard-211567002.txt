 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 

 MEDIA RELEASE    

 ABBOTT GOVERNMENT’S SILENCE ON VIETNAMESE ASYLUM SEEKERS A  DISGRACE    

 The Abbott Government must explain to the Australian community exactly what has  occurred in relation to the assessment and return of approximately 50 Vietnamese  asylum seekers.    

 This is yet another appalling example of Operation Sovereign Borders being  shrouded in absolute secrecy and the breathtaking arrogance of this Government’s  policy on asylum seekers.     

 In a week when details of resettlement arrangements for refugees on Nauru were  revealed via leaks to media sources and other third parties, the Abbott Government  remains hidden behind the mantra of “operational matters” when it comes to asylum  seekers.    

 Minister Dutton must immediately provide details on what refugee assessment  process the Australian Government undertook with regard to these asylum seekers,  including when it took place and who undertook the assessments.    

 The Minister also needs to assure the Australian community that we are in no way in  breach of our international obligations regarding non-refoulement of refugees.
