 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Wednesday, 28 November 2012    

 Government votes in favour of breaking the law  to punish refugees    

 The Greens know that it is illegal in international law to withhold the right to work from refugees,  but today the Government voted to continue down a worrying path of punishing refugees.     

 “The Government has clearly made a choice; they are willing to break the law to punish vulnerable  refugees to win votes,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “I moved a motion in the Senate calling on the Government to honour the legal right of refugees to  work, but they ganged up with the Opposition to vote it down.    

 “After sustained pressure and criticism, this was an opportunity for the Labor Party to clear up their  position on the rights for refugees to work after days spent flip-flopping on the issue.    

 “Unfortunately they have chosen to keep people in the dark while they punish vulnerable refugees  fleeing war and persecution.    

 “Labor and the Coalition are locked in an appalling race to the bottom on immigration policy and it  has to end.”
