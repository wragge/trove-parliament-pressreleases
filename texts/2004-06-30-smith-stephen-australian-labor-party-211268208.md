 COALITION SUPPORT FOR LABOR’S KIDS OUT OF DETENTION  POLICY   

 Labor welcomes support for its children out of immigration detention policy from Judy Moylan,  Member for Pearce and former Coalition Government Minister.   

 Late last month Ms Moylan wrote to a constituent expressing her concern over the Howard  Government’s policy and administration of keeping children in long-term immigration detention.   In the letter Ms Moylan states,   

 ..I have made and continue to make numerous representations to the Prime Minister  seeking the immediate release of women and children from detention.   

 When the Human Rights Equal Opportunity Commission’s (HREOC) Report into Children in  immigration detention was released on 15 May, the Minister for Immigration refused to accept the  findings and recommendations of the report.     

 The HREOC Report ‘A last resort?’ is an indictment of the Howard Government’s children in  immigration detention policy and an indictment of its administration of that policy.   

 It appears Ms Moylan has a greater appreciation of the Report’s findings than her Minister and has  accepted the recommendation that children should be released from immigration detention  immediately.   

 The HREOC Report shows that the Government has presided over a bad period here and the  Howard Government’s immigration detention policy and administration has been a mistake.   Labor is committed to set the system up for the future so that this cannot happen again. 

 

 The Member for Pearce has joined a number of Coalition backbenchers publicly opposing the  Howard Government’s policy approach to asylum seekers.     

 Throughout this year Ms Moylan’s Coalition colleagues, John Forrest, Member for Mallee, Petro  Georgio, Member for Kooyong, Patrick Secker, Member for Barker, and Kay Hull, Member for  Riverina, have urged for a new approach to the Howard Government’s policy for Temporary  Protection Visa holders.   

 Under John Howard’s asylum seeker system, over 9,000 TPV holders who have been assessed as  refugees by the Government have no certainty in their lives and could potentially live in the  Australian community on a temporary basis for the rest of their lives.  Labor’s policy change to a  two year one-off TPV will end that uncertainty.
