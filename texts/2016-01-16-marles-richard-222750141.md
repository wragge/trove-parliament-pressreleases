 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION   MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 SAVE THE CHILDREN STAFF VINDICATED 

 The Turnbull Government’s release of an official report late yesterday into the  conduct of Save the Children workers may have been an attempt to avoid the media,  but it can’t escape the need for Peter Dutton to apologise today. 

 Nine staff from Save the Children were removed from Nauru by the former  Immigration Minister Scott Morrison in 2014 after they raised concerns about  conditions at the Australian funded centre. 

 At the time, Mr Morrison said: "the public don't want to be played for mugs with  allegations of sexual abuse being used as some kind of political tactic". 

 Yesterday’s report found no evidence the staff acted outside their duties and that  they should be offered compensation. 

 The Government needs to today issue an immediate apology to Save the Children  and the staff involved. 

 Instead of constantly playing the blame game, this Government should focus on  improving facilities and increasing processing of asylum seekers.
