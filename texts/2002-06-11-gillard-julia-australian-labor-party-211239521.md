 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 11 June 2002

 GOVERNMENT MINISTERS ALL AT SEA ON THE TRUTH

 Foreign Affairs Minister Downer is in open conflict with Immigration Minister Ruddock over the facts surrounding ‘that’ boat.

 This morning Mr Downer said he had known for a fortnight that the boat was coming; yet Mr Ruddock’s office told journalists on Friday that there was no boat.

 Mr Downer also said that any asylum seekers in the newly excised zones off northern Australia would be processed on Christmas Island.

 The Government should immediately answer the following questions:

 â¢ When did the Government first know there was a boat? â¢ Didn’t Indonesian newspapers carry reports of a small wooden hulled boat more than a fortnight before the Government acted on last Friday? â¢ Isn’t the Foreign Affairs Minister referring to those reports? â¢ Given the Government knew of these reports why did the Government leave it until

 Friday to act and why didn’t it use the time available to properly consult the Opposition? â¢ Why didn’t Minister Ruddock announce the details of the boat on Friday? â¢ If the ‘Pacific Solution’ is working effectively, why do boats continue to come? â¢ How will asylum seekers be processed on Christmas Island when construction of a detention centre has not yet begun? â¢ What is the future of the ‘Pacific Solution’ given President Harris’s comments? â¢ Aren’t the claims made in the Budget that no new asylum seekers will be processed on Australian soil and that the ‘Pacific Solution’ will last four years just wishful thinking?
