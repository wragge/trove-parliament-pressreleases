 Returned to torture and death: Greens push for  an end to forced Afghan repatriation   

 The Australian Greens will move a motion in the Parliament calling for a moratorium on forced  refugee returns to Afghanistan and asking for a team of experts to be deployed on a fact-finding  mission, after disturbing revelations surfaced that Hazara men have been tortured and killed by the  Taliban in recent weeks.   

 “We’re fighting extremism in Iraq while forcing refugees into the arms of the Taliban in Afghanistan.  It just doesn’t make sense,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young  said.   

 “I have very little faith in the government’s internal investigation and that’s why I’ll be moving a  motion in the Parliament, calling for an immediate end to all forced Afghan deportations.   

 “Mistakes have been made and they have had disastrous consequences. Rather than learning from  those mistakes, the Abbott government is continuing to make them and that’s incredibly  dangerous.”   

 Revelations that the government is planning to deport at least seven more Afghan Hazaras have  prompted the Greens to also call for a delegation of DFAT officials to be sent to Afghanistan, to  investigate the situation there.   

 The Greens’ motion will ask that the delegation create a written report on the situation in  Afghanistan, that would then be tabled in Parliament.   

 “A genuine fact-finding mission will expose the truth behind this cruel and dangerous practice of  forced returns to Afghanistan,” Senator Hanson-Young said.   

 “These dangerous deportations must come to an end.”
