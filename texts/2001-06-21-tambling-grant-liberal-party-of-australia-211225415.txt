 PARLIAMENTARY RESOLUTION ON EAST TIMOR  

 Yesterday’s deployment of Australian troops in the UN multinational peacekeeping force INTERFET to East Timor marks a turning point for Australia in more ways than one.

 It marks a line in the sand in our relations with one of our nearest neighbours and some of our oldest allies. It challenges our strength as a military force as we engage in real life armed service on foreign soil for the first time in more than 30 years.

 But there is also the opportunity for Australia to reaffirm its position as one of the leading diplomatic, political, economic and military powers of South East Asia through the restoration of calm in the eastern provinces of Indonesia and the subsequent establishment of an independent East Timor.

 In the meantime, the situation remains tense. Australia will need to instigate a delicate balance between using whatever force is necessary to rid the region of malevolent violence and unrest, and diplomacy as Australia attempts to restore friendly relations between a fledging independent East Timor and Indonesia, between Indonesia and Australia, and between Australia and one of its oldest Pacific allies, the United States - whose reluctance to fully support a UN multinational peacekeeping force with ground troops caused strain and comment.

 Despite almost 78.5 per cent of East Timor’s 450,000 stong electorate voting in favour of independence on August 30, the following period unleashed untold horrors by militias and their military supporters onto our television screens on a nightly basis, branding itself into our collective consciousness. The will of the East Timorese people must be allowed to take effect.

 As Australians, we have made clear our protest at the persecution of East Timorese people, particularly in respect to East Timor’s geographic, cultural and economic importance. I know that I speak for all Australians when I restate in the strongest terms my earlier condemnation of the murders, forced removals and other acts of violence perpetrated against the East Timorese people.

 At the National Party Federal Council on 11 September 1999, I moved a successful motion in strong terms -

 This Federal Council of the National Party of Australia, in acknowledgment of:

 The debt of gratitude felt by many Australian families for life-saving assistance rendered by the people of east Timor to Australian personnel during World War II, and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The validity of the 30n August 1999 vote on self-determination in East Timor, as verified by Australian and other UN observer delegations, âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 deplores in the strongest terms the murders, forced removals and other acts of violence .  

 perpetrated against the people of East Timor; applauds the courage and determination of the Australian Federal Police, UN and aid personnel, and all others of goodwill in Indonesia, in their efforts to alleviate the humanitarian emergency;

 b.  

 endorses the continuing efforts of the Federal Government in seeking an international resolution to the crisis; c.  

 calls on the Indonesian authorities to take urgent and immediate action to restore civil order and secure the safety of all citizens in East Timor; d.  

 expresses its disappointment at the reluctance of the United States of America, as a long-term Pacific ally, to fully support a UN peacekeeping force and urges the US Congress to become closely associated with an international solution; and

 e.  

 requires the Australian Government to maintain, at an appropriate stage of readiness, a force of arms sufficient to play a significant and effective partnership peacekeeping role in East Timor.

 f.  

 The Indonesian Government and its military have an obligation to all people of Indonesia as it is presently constituted and they must ensure that this obligation is met by ensuring the safety of all Timorese irrespective of their politics, ethnicity or home province. This obligation is also recognised in the Security Council Resolution authorising the INTERFET deployment to the territory.

 Australia’s bond with the East Timorese people has never been so apparent as now. I think it’s important we don’t lose sight of the human face of this conflict and the lasting impact that it will no doubt have on the East Timorese, and their friends and relatives in Australia, and particularly Darwin. I spoke last night in the Senate on the support given so generously by so many volunteers and public servants.

 We only have to look at the ties between the countries to understand just how close to home the atrocities are. As a Territorian, I am particularly conscious of them and the evil and criminal actions that were so patently obvious.

 Darwin is just 730 kilometres from Dili; Darwin is physically closer to Indonesia’s capital Jakarta than to Australia’s own national capital Canberra. Similarly, our ties in terms of friendship and culture with both Indonesia and East Timor span back to World War II when a debt of gratitude was expressed by many Australian families for life-saving assistance rendered by the people of East Timor, in particular to Australian personnel.

 Following the Asian financial crisis and the end of the Soeharto era in May 1998 there has been rapid social, political and economic change throughout Indonesia . Coincidentally, the Northern Territory in particular has spent that last ten years developing relationships with the various players in the region. With those relationships comes responsibility, in terms of commerce, health, education and of course, maintaining a secure, peaceful neighbourhood for all concerned.

 Although Australia is now dealing with arguably the most intense military situation in decades, the openness of those past discussions now stands us in good stead for the future. It provides the hopeful basis for dealing with human rights abuses, and maintaining relationships of integrity with people demonstrating goodwill.

 The lasting effects of the current conflict will become apparent on both sides of the Timor Sea for decades - and most likely generations - to come. East Timorese people will face real social problems in the future re-establishing homes, educational facilities, commercial enterprise and even the most basic infrastructure we take for granted here in Australia. Very large numbers of the East Timorese have been displaced. Australia and the Northern Territory in particular will be heavily involved in aid and assistance to the East Timorese for years to come.

 It is on that point that Australia must always maintain at the forefront of its thinking the reality that we are dealing with real people and their real lives in our neighbourhood. We have to remember that an incorrect decision could cost many lives, while a correct one could save many and set up a positive future for the East Timorese.

 Australia has a real social responsibility to do right, and to be right on human rights.

 We are now not only in a peacekeeping mission but a humanitarian mission as well. Australian troops can be doubly proud of the fact that not only are they doing what is right for the Timorese people by maintaining the peace and assisting with getting the independence process back on track, they are also part of a vital humanitarian effort that will save thousands of lives.

 Even before current events unfolded, Australia’s defence forces, foreign affairs and intelligence officers had been instrumental in preparing a robust response to the potential for the collapse of law and order in East Timor. Australia, through the Federal and Northern Territory Governments and the Australian Defence Force, had as early as March of this year, planned for the deployment of troops and equipment to strategic posts in Darwin in anticipation of a peacekeeping role. In April of this year the Northern Territory Government published a Capability Statement of the Territory’s potential support for East Timor. That planning was both prudent and prescient.

 Australia - and Darwin, currently Australia’s strategic centre - is now set to become the focal point of the international community as it greets the spotlight as the main military base for the INTERFET force.

 Darwin’s provision of defence support to incoming troops, as well as its immediate and willing response to the plight of the East Timorese refugees, has showcased the range and efficiency of its services and the crucial support role it will play in the next few months for Australian and international troops in the lead-up to the UN peacekeeping role.

 Although I acknowledge the skill and preparatory work put in by the Australian Defence Force in the Northern Territory in past months, make no mistake: Australia’s defence forces face a real risk of serious casualty. However, I note that East Timor’s resistance leader Xanana Gusmao has thanked Australian soldiers for their presence on the ground, while other groups have pledged assistance to our troops and the incredible support garnered from the fourteen other countries working in partnership as part of INTERFET.

 But, with risk comes opportunity - the opportunity for Australia to make another historic contribution to the peaceful transition of an independent East Timor and to do the right thing in humanitarian terms.

 The impact on this deployment has obviously been great on the Northern Territory community, but while it is sad to see our troops leave the safety of home, it is heartening to see the outpouring of support and gratitude for those who have become such an integral part of Northern Territory life so quickly. It is

 imperative that this cooperation and goodwill continues.

 Australia, Indonesia, Portugal, the United Nations and most importantly the people of East Timor must look to the future - there must be a long term solution that will promote stability and promise an economic future for the region.

 Consultation and mediation between all players involved is vital. In the immediate future we will need to see the reconstruction of infrastructure - already there has been a disruption of services, which will need to be restored to ensure accessibility to important services within various regions of East Timor.

 Recent events have had the potential to disrupt the momentum and integrity of the relationship between Australia and Indonesia. Nevertheless, the Australia-Indonesia relationship is a long and close one that will stand the test of time.

 The questions Australia needs to ask, and ones well worthy of reflection, are:

 How do we restore peaceful relations with Indonesia? âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» What are the longer term issues Australia will need to face in its peacekeeping role? âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» What is our commitment to the new independent state of East Timor? âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 In the wider sphere of Indonesian nationalism, the November parliament will provide a new slant on the picture. Very obviously, once the new parliament is constituted, a new flavour of government will come to the fore, providing an opportune time for Australia to reaffirm that the Javanese administration, and its strongarm military tactics, will no longer be acceptable.

 Australia needs to guarantee that its influence and responsibility comes to bear to ensure that the Indonesian military puppetmasters do not have the upper hand in any new democratisation within Indonesia.

 Australia must play a visionary role that underpins its commitment to human rights and restores the peaceful atmosphere in our immediate neighbourhood. As Senator for the Northern Territory, the most crucially important strategic centre in this matter, I trust that the efforts to restore peace and security by military action, under the leadership of the United Nations and Australia, will be successful and ensure the climate for the necessary reconciliations to which we all aspire.
