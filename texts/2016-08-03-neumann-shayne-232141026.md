 THE HON SHAYNE NEUMANN MP 

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR    

 

 TURNBULL GOVERNMENT MUST ENSURE SAFETY AND WELLBEING OF  ASYLUM SEEKERS IN NAURU    

 Labor is deeply troubled by reports released today by Human Rights Watch and  Amnesty International into the living and health care conditions for refugees in the off  shore processing centre in Nauru.    

 Australia has an obligation to ensure that refugees living in off shore processing centres  are safe and are afforded the opportunity to access appropriate health care.    

 Labor calls on Immigration Minister Peter Dutton to immediately investigate these  claims and ensure the safety of refugees and asylum seekers living in off shore  processing facilities.    

 This is an Australian Government funded facility and the culture of secrecy cannot be  allowed to continue.    

 That is why Labor will continue to advocate for independent oversight mechanisms for  Australian-funded processing facilities.    

 Todayâ€™s report emphasises the urgent need for the Turnbull Government to find a  durable, third country resettlement arrangement to resolve the fate of asylum seekers in  Nauru.
