 Media Centre  Minister to Visit St George MRC 

 25 October 2005 

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, John Cobb, will meet  people who work tirelessly with newly arrived migrants and refugees  when he visits the St George Migrant Resource Centre (MRC) tomorrow. 

 ‘Migrant Resource Centres are an important ‘one stop shop’ for  thousands of migrants and refugees who are successfully resettled every  year in Australia,’ Mr Cobb said. 

 ‘Australia’s settlement services are amongst the world’s most generous  and the government is committed to ensuring these people have the  support and assistance they need to build a successful life in their new  home,’ Mr Cobb said. 

 The St George MRC has received more than $356 000 in funding from  the Australian Government in the 2004-05 financial year. It also receives  more than $189 000 under the Community Settlement Services Scheme  in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. 

 ‘Migrant Resource Centres create a vital link between the incoming  settlers and their new community by providing assistance in a variety of  areas including language skills, housing and employment. 

 ‘Through this support, migrants and refugees develop a sense of  belonging and are able to contribute to their community socially and  economically,’ Mr Cobb said. 

 The Minister will visit the St George Migrant Resource Centre, 552  Princes Highway in Rockdale on 26 October at 9:30am.
