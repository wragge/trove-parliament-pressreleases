 Julia Gillard and Mark Latham - New Boat, Same  Old Policy Failure

 ALP News Statements

 Reports today that a boat of Vietnamese asylum seekers was located just three  kilometres off the Western Australian coast confirms the Howard Government has not  succeeded in stopping unauthorised boats arriving unannounced on our shores.

 For this boat to be detected so close to the mainland shows that Australia needs a  Coastguard. Only Labor will establish a Coastguard - a cop on the beat 24 hours a  day, 365 days a year. Labor's plan will see Australia protected by new, larger offshore  patrol vessels, purpose-built for border protection, capable of operating right out to  Christmas Island and the Indian Ocean territories. A Coastguard will provide real  protection of our maritime borders.

 The Howard Government has said that a Coastguard is not needed because there are  no more boats coming. They should now recognise the folly of that statement. The  Howard Government needs to tell the Australia people how this boat remained  undetected for so long and how this boat was able to almost reach the Australian  coast. 

 How and where will these asylum seekers be processed? We know that the Christmas  Island centre is not an option due to contract bungling by the Immigration Department  and closing of this centre earlier this year. As a result, the contract is now being re-tendered and will be overseen by the Finance Department. As to when the permanent  centre will eventually be built and what its capacity will be, who really knows? So, after  8 years of dealing with boat people as the Minister for Immigration, Minister Ruddock  is still allowing people to be processed in the sports hall of Christmas Island. 

 Only Labor has a comprehensive policy to deal with asylum seekers and refugees -  Protecting Australia and Protecting the Australian Way. The Government's plan on  asylum seekers is simply to engage in policy on the run.  Authorised by Geoff Walsh, 19 National Circuit, Barton ACT 2600.
