 Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration 

 SENATOR GARY HUMPHRIES 

 Chair - Senate Legal & Constitutional Affairs References Committee 

 ***MEDIA RELEASE*** 

 SENATE COMMITTEE ISSUES DAMNING  REPORT ON MALAYSIA SOLUTION 

 The Senate Legal & Constitutional Affairs Committee has today tabled the damning  report of its inquiry into the Government’s troubled Malaysia Solution.  

 “The Committee’s report tells us what most Australians already know - the Malaysia  Solution is terrible public policy,” Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration,  Senator Michaelia Cash, said today. 

 “The Malaysia Solution has been shown to have been cobbled together with little  attention to detail and absolutely no due diligence.  The process has been a shambles. 

 “The Committee’s report merely strengthens the case that the Government must dump  this atrocious non-solution to boat arrivals. 

 “The Malaysia Solution has received a categorical rejection from the Senate Legal &  Constitutional Affairs Committee. The Committee found that the Malaysia Solution is  fundamentally and irreversibly flawed, and that the Gillard Government should not  proceed with the Malaysian Solution,” inquiry chair Senator Gary Humphries said  today. 

 “Not one submission to the Committee’s inquiry argued in favour of the Malaysian  Solution. 

 “The Committee report found that the Australian Government should meet the Prime  Minister's previous commitment to 'rule out' sending asylum seekers who travel to  Australia by boat to countries which are not a signatory to the Refugee Convention. 

 “The risk to refugees and asylum seekers of being caned in Malaysia was a serious  concern for the Committee.  The Committee was particularly stunned that any  assurances that refugees would not be caned were non-binding with no avenues of  appeal. 

 “The Government should dump this atrocious policy immediately,” Senator  Humphries concluded.

 RECOMMENDATIONS 

 Recommendation 1 

 4.27 The committee recommends that the Australian Government not proceed  with the implementation of the Arrangement between the Government of Australia  and the Government of Malaysia on transfer and resettlement, due to the obvious  flaws and defects in that arrangement.  

 

 

 

 

 

 CHAPTER 1 

 Introduction 

 Referral of the inquiry 

 1.1 On 17 August 2011, the Senate referred Australia's agreement with Malaysia  in relation to asylum seekers (Malaysian Arrangement or arrangement) to the  Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee (committee) for inquiry and  report by 22 September 2011, with particular reference to: 

 (a) the consistency of the agreement to transfer asylum seekers to Malaysia  with Australia's international obligations; 

 (b) the extent to which the above agreement complies with Australian  human rights standards, as defined by law; 

 (c) the practical implementation of the agreement, including: 

 (i) oversight and monitoring, 

 (ii) pre-transfer arrangements, in particular, processes for assessing the  vulnerability of asylum seekers, 

 (iii) mechanisms for appeal of removal decisions, 

 (iv) access to independent legal advice and advocacy, 

 (v) implications for unaccompanied minors, in particular, whether  there are any guarantees with respect to their treatment, and 

 (vi) the obligations of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  (Mr Bowen) as the legal guardian of any unaccompanied minors  arriving in Australia, and his duty of care to protect their best  interests; 

 (d) the costs associated with the agreement; 

 (e) the potential liability of parties with respect to breaches of terms of the  agreement or future litigation; 

 (f) the adequacy of services and support provided to asylum seekers  transferred to Malaysia, particularly with respect to access to health and  education, industrial protections, accommodation and support for special  needs and vulnerable groups; 

 (g) mechanisms to enable the consideration of claims for protection from  Malaysia and compliance of these mechanisms with non-refoulement  principles; 

 (h) a comparison of this agreement with other policy alternatives for  processing irregular maritime arrivals; and 

 (i) any other related matters.

 1.2 On 23 August 2011, the Senate agreed to extend the reporting date of the  inquiry until 11 October 2011. 

 Conduct of the inquiry 

 1.3  The committee advertised the inquiry in The Australian newspaper on  31 August 2011, and initially invited submissions by 2 September 2011. More than  200 organisations and individuals were invited to make submissions. Details of the  inquiry and associated documents were placed on the committee's website. 

 1.4 Following the decision by the High Court of Australia on 31 August 2011 that  the Malaysian Arrangement is effectively invalid,1 the committee decided that there  was merit from a public policy perspective in continuing the inquiry as originally  referred. A revised submissions closing date of 14 September 2011 was set, although  the committee continued to accept submissions well after that date. The inquiry was  advertised again in The Australian on 14 September 2011. 

 1.5 The committee received 37 submissions from various organisations and  individuals. All public submissions and responses to questions on notice were  published on the committee's website, and are listed at Appendix 1. 

 1.6 The committee held a public hearing in Canberra on 23 September 2011.  Witnesses who appeared at the hearing are listed at Appendix 2 and the Hansard  transcript is available on the committee's website.  

 Structure of the report 

 1.7  Chapter 2 provides background information on the Malaysian Arrangement -  including an overview of the main clauses of the arrangement and its operational  guidelines - and briefly summarises the High Court's decision, as well as subsequent  proposed legislative amendments. 

 1.8 Chapter 3 considers some of the key concerns raised in submissions and  evidence; and Chapter 4 sets out the committee view and recommendations. 

 Acknowledgement 

 1.9 The committee thanks those organisations and individuals who made  submissions and gave evidence at the public hearing.

 CHAPTER 2 

 Background 

 2.1 This chapter provides an overview of the process by which the 

 Malaysian Arrangement on asylum seekers was developed, and explains some of the  arrangement's key provisions. The High Court's decision in the case of Plaintiff  M70/2011 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship; Plaintiff M106 of 2011 v  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship1 is also examined; along with the  Australian Government's subsequent introduction of legislative amendments intended  to address the issues arising from the High Court's decision. 

 Joint Prime Ministerial statement on the Malaysian Arrangement 

 2.2 On 7 May 2011, in a joint statement with the Prime Minister of Malaysia, the  Prime Minister announced a commitment for both governments to enter into a new  arrangement to help address people smuggling and irregular migration in the Asia-Pacific region.2 

 2.3 The joint statement outlined the core elements of the bilateral arrangement,  namely that: 

 ï· 800 irregular maritime arrivals (Transferees), who arrive in Australia after the  date of effect of the arrangement, would be transferred to Malaysia for  refugee status determination; 

 ï· in return, over four years, Australia would resettle 4,000 refugees already 

 currently residing in Malaysia; 

 ï· Transferees would not receive any preferential treatment over asylum seekers  already in Malaysia; 

 ï· Transferees would be provided with the opportunity to have their asylum  claims considered and those in need of international protection would not be  refouled; 

 ï· Transferees would be treated with dignity and respect, and in accordance with 

 human rights standards; and

 ï· Australia would fully fund the arrangement. 3  

 Signing of the Malaysian Arrangement 

 2.4 On 25 July 2011, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship (Minister) announced that the Arrangement between the Government of  Australia and the Government of Malaysia on transfer and resettlement  (Malaysian Arrangement or arrangement) had been signed by Australia and  Malaysia.4 Also on 25 July 2011, the Minister issued an Instrument of Declaration 

 which purportedly provided the statutory basis for the transfer of asylum seekers to  Malaysia as a 'declared' country under section 198A of the Migration Act 1958  (Migration Act).5 

 Key provisions of the Malaysian Arrangement  

 2.5 For the most part, the Malaysian Arrangement reflects the core elements  outlined in the joint statement by the Australian and Malaysian Prime Ministers on  7 May 2011.  

 2.6 Under the Malaysian Arrangement, the Government of Malaysia will accept  up to a maximum of 800 'Transferees' (clause 7(1)). Transferees are people who, after  the date of the signing of the arrangement, have travelled irregularly by sea to  Australia, or who have been intercepted at sea by Australian authorities while trying to  reach Australia by irregular means (clause 4(1)(a)). 

 2.7 Transferees found to be refugees will be 'referred to resettlement countries  pursuant to normal processes and criteria of the United Nations High Commissioner  for Refugees' (UNHCR) (clause 6). Where a Transferee is found not to be a refugee,  the arrangement states that voluntary return is the preferred option. However, where a  Transferee does not agree to return to their country of origin voluntarily, then forced  returns may be necessary (clause 11(1)). 

 2.8 Pursuant to the arrangement, the Australian Government will resettle  4,000 refugees, currently residing in Malaysia, over a four-year period at a rate of  approximately 1,000 people per year (clause 7(2)). In order to be resettled in

 Australia, a person must hold a UNHCR card and must have entered Malaysia and  been registered with the UNHCR prior to the date of signing of the 

 Malaysian Arrangement. Such persons must have remained in Malaysia since the date  of signing (clause 5(1)(a)). 

 2.9 The Malaysian Arrangement also sets out a number of commitments by the  Governments of Australia and Malaysia. The joint commitments include that  Transferees and persons to be resettled in Australia 'will be treated with dignity and  respect and in accordance with human rights standards' (clause 8(1)). There is also a  commitment to develop specific procedures to deal with the special needs of  vulnerable cases, including unaccompanied minors (clause 8(2)). 

 2.10 The arrangement sets out a list of costs that the Australian Government has  committed to cover, including costs related to (clause 9(1)): 

 ï· any interdiction and Transferee management costs involved in the actual 

 transfer from Australia to Malaysia, and any Australian detention costs;  

 ï· transportation costs incurred to transfer Transferees to Malaysia, including the 

 costs of any escorts and interpreters;  

 ï· costs related to the health and welfare (including education of minor children)  of Transferees in accordance with UNHCR's model of assistance in Malaysia;  and 

 ï· additional 'safety net' costs related to meeting any special welfare needs of 

 Transferees (especially vulnerable cases), drawing also on the services of the  International Organisation for Migration (IOM) as necessary.  

 2.11 There is also provision for the Australian Government to cover other costs, as  agreed (clause 9(1)(k)). 

 2.12 The Australian Government has made commitments with respect to the return  of Transferees found not to be in need of international protection (clause 9(4)).  Specifically, the Australian Government will assist the Government of Malaysia in the  return of a Transferee to their country of origin, including assistance with financial  costs, administrative arrangements through the use of a service provider such as IOM,  and liaison with the country of origin. 

 2.13 The Government of Malaysia has committed to providing Transferees with  the opportunity to have their asylum claims considered by the UNHCR and 'will  respect the principle of non-refoulement' (clause 10(2)(a)). However, the arrangement  provides that the benefit of non-refoulement may not be claimed by a Transferee who  is a refugee where (clause 10(2)(b)): 

 ï· there are reasonable grounds for regarding the person as a danger to the 

 security of Malaysia or  

 ï· the person has been convicted by a final judgement of a 'particularly serious  crime that constitutes a danger to the community of Malaysia'. 

 Page 8  

 

 2.14 Clause 12 sets out a number of agreed terms of the arrangement, including: 

 ï· operations under the arrangement are to be carried out in accordance with the 

 domestic laws, rules, regulations and national policies from time to time in  force in each country, and in accordance with the parties' respective  obligations under international law (clause 12(1)); and  

 ï· Transferees should not be given 'any preferential treatment in the order of 

 processing their claims in Malaysia' and should 'receive no processing  advantage as a result of having undertaken irregular migration to Australia'  (clause 12(2)). 

 2.15 The Malaysian Arrangement also provides for a Joint Committee and an  Advisory Committee (clause 13).  

 2.16 The Joint Committee will be made up of one representative each from the  Malaysian Ministry of Home Affairs and the Australian Department of Immigration  and Citizenship (and such other representatives as may be agreed) (clause 13(2)), and  will have the following responsibilities (clause 13(1)): 

 ï· management of the transfer arrangements; 

 ï· oversight of the welfare of Transferees; 

 ï· ensuring that funding is expended appropriately; and 

 ï· engagement with service providers.  

 2.17 The Advisory Committee will provide advice to the respective governments  on issues arising out of the implementation of the arrangement, as well as being a  body to which each party might refer issues for consideration (clause 13(3)). The  Advisory Committee will be made up of two representatives from each of the  Malaysian and Australian Governments, a representative from each of the UNHCR  and the IOM (subject to their agreement), and other representatives as agreed by the  parties (clause 13(4)).  

 2.18 Clause 18, the so-called 'Resolution of Differences' clause, provides that any  differences between the Participants over the interpretation or application of the  arrangement are to be resolved as soon as reasonably practicable by consultation  between the parties. 

 Key provisions of the Operational Guidelines 

 2.19 The Operational guidelines to support transfers and resettlement  (Operational Guidelines) set out the processes to be followed for moving Transferees  to Malaysia and the resettlement of refugees in Australia from Malaysia. 

 2.20 Item 1 of the Operational Guidelines covers the transfer process from  Australia to Malaysia. Initial handling of Transferees in Australia will include  (item 1.1.1):  

  Page 9 

 

 ï· collection of biodata and biometrics (photo and fingerprints) for each 

 Transferee;  

 ï· checking Transferees against the Australian 'watch list';  

 ï· medical assessments to ensure that Transferees are 'fit to travel'; and  

 ï· counselling Transferees about the transfer process and a briefing on 'what to  expect in Malaysia'.  

 2.21 The Operational Guidelines also set a pre-transfer notification process  between Australian and Malaysian authorities (item 1.1.2). Part of that notification  process will allow for exemption orders to be put in place for Transferees under  Malaysian immigration and passport legislation.  

 2.22 The Operational Guidelines provide that the parties will aim to have each  group of Transferees transferred to Malaysia within 72 hours of their arrival in  Australia (item 1.3).  

 2.23 On arrival in Malaysia, Transferees will be handed over to Malaysian  authorities 'at the door of the aircraft'. Transferees will be encouraged to disembark  voluntarily. If Transferees do not disembark voluntarily, however, they will be  escorted to the door of the aircraft by Australian authorities and handed to Malaysian  authorities (item 1.4.1).  

 2.24 Item 2 of the Operational Guidelines covers the post-arrival arrangements for  Transferees in Malaysia. Following initial processing at the airport, Transferees will  be taken to a transit centre for further processing. Malaysian authorities will authorise  departure of Transferees from the transit centre 'generally' within 45 days  (item 2.1.2(f)).  

 2.25 The Transferee pathways in Malaysia are: 

 ï· voluntary return to the relevant country of origin (item 2.2.1);  

 ï· seeking asylum through the UNHCR process (item 2.2.2); and  

 ï· consideration of a person's claim to complementary protection by Australian 

 authorities where the person seeks neither voluntary return or asylum  (item 2.2.3). 

 2.26 Item 2.3 sets out the various steps which follow from the determination of a  person's refugee status. These are divided into three scenarios: where a person is  found to be a refugee; where a person is found not to be a refugee; and where the  person decides during the refugee determination process to leave Malaysia. 

 2.27 Item 3 sets out conditions for Transferees during their temporary stay in  Malaysia, and focuses on the period following the Transferees' departure from the  Transit centre. Some of the key points are: 

 ï· 'generally', Transferees will be allowed to reside in the community 

 (item 3.1(a)); 

 Page 10  

 

 ï· Transferees will be encouraged to become self-sufficient as soon as possible 

 (item 3.2(b));  

 ï· IOM will pay Transferees a support payment to cover living costs for the first  month in the community (item 3.2(c)); 

 ï· Transferees of school age will be permitted access to private education  arrangements in the community and, where such arrangements are not  available or affordable, children will have access to informal education  arrangements organised by IOM (item 3.3); and 

 ï· vulnerable Transferees will be identified by IOM's initial health assessment, 

 and will have access to the existing arrangements which the UNHCR has in  place for identifying and supporting vulnerable cases (and a 'backup safety  net' will also be provided by IOM) (item 3.5 (a) and (b)). 

 2.28 Item 4 sets out the processes for resettlement of refugees in Australia from  Malaysia; and item 5 sets out the terms of reference and membership of the Joint  Committee and the Advisory Committee. 

 High Court's decision6 

 2.29 Under subsection 198A(3) of the Migration Act, the Minister is invested with  discretion to: 

 (a) declare in writing that a specified country: 

 (i) provides access, for persons seeking asylum, to effective procedures for  assessing their need for protection; and 

 (ii) provides protection for persons seeking asylum, pending determination  of their refugee status; and 

 (iii) provides protection to persons who are given refugee status, pending  their voluntary repatriation to their country of origin or resettlement in  another country; and 

 (iv) meets relevant human rights standards in providing that protection. 

 2.30 As noted earlier in this chapter, the Minister declared Malaysia as a specified  country under subsection 198A(3) in order to facilitate the transfer of asylum seekers  to that country pursuant to the terms of the Malaysian Arrangement.  

 2.31 The High Court's decision related to two matters, known as M70/2011 and  M106 of 2011, involving two asylum seekers (plaintiffs). Plaintiff M70/2011 is a 24-year-old male citizen of Afghanistan, and Plaintiff M106 of 2011 is a 16-year-old  unaccompanied male citizen of Afghanistan. Both plaintiffs arrived at

 Christmas Island in August 2011 as part of a larger group of asylum seekers, and were  identified as liable to transfer to Malaysia under the Malaysian Arrangement. 

 2.32 The plaintiffs commenced proceedings in the High Court seeking orders  which included a declaration of invalidity in respect of the instrument made on  25 July 2011, and an order in the nature of prohibition to restrain the Minister and the  Commonwealth from taking any steps to remove them from Australia. 

 2.33 The main issues considered by the High Court were whether the Minister's  declaration of Malaysia had been validly made under section 198A of the  Migration Act, and whether the Minister had satisfied the requirements of the  Immigration (Guardianship of Children Act) 1946 (Guardianship of Children Act) in 

 relation to the 16-year-old Afghan citizen. 

 2.34 On 31 August 2011, the High Court by majority (6:1) found that the  Minister's declaration of Malaysia had been made without power and was therefore  invalid. The basis for this finding was summarised in the joint majority judgment:  

 ...the references in s 198A(3)(a) to a country that provides access and  provides protection are to be construed as references to provision of access  or protection in accordance with an obligation to do so. Where, as in the  present case, it is agreed that Malaysia: first, does not recognise the status  of refugee in its domestic law and does not undertake any activities related  to the reception, registration, documentation and status determination of  asylum seekers and refugees; second, is not party to the Refugees  Convention or the Refugees Protocol; and, third, has made no legally  binding arrangement with Australia obliging it to accord the protections  required by those instruments; it was not open to the Minister to conclude  that Malaysia provides the access or protections referred to in  s 198A(3)(a)(i) to (iii). The Minister's conclusions that persons seeking  asylum have access to UNHCR procedures for assessing their need for  protection and that neither persons seeking asylum nor persons who are  given refugee status are ill-treated pending determination of their refugee  status or repatriation or resettlement did not form a sufficient basis for  making the declaration.7  

 2.35 The majority also found that the Minister was precluded from removing the  16-year-old plaintiff from Australia:  

 A determination by the Minister (or his delegate) that an unaccompanied  minor should be taken from Australia to a country declared under  s 198A(3)(a) of the Migration Act would not constitute a consent in writing  of the kind required by s 6A of the [Guardian and Citizenship] Act. Nor  would the exercise of power to take an offshore entry person to another  country pursuant to s 198A(1) fall within the operation of s 6A(4) of the 

 

 7  Plaintiff M70/2011 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship; Plaintiff M106 v Minister for  Immigration and Citizenship, [2011] HCA 32, per Gummow, Hayne, Crennan and Bell JJ at  135. 

 Page 12  

 

 [Guardian and Citizenship]  Act and its provision that s 6A "shall not affect  the operation of any other law regulating the departure of persons from  Australia"...  

 Accordingly, removal of a person from Australia who is a "non-citizen  child" within the meaning of the [Guardian and Citizenship]  Act, or the  taking of that child to another country pursuant to s 198A, cannot lawfully  be effected without the consent in writing of the Minister (or his delegate).  The decision to grant a consent of that kind would be a decision under an  enactment and would therefore engage the provisions of the Administrative  Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) and, in particular, the  provisions of that Act concerning the giving of reasons as well as the  availability of review on any of the grounds stated in that Act.8 

 2.36 In response to the High Court's decision, the Prime Minister commented that  it represented a 'missed opportunity': 

 …yesterday's High Court decision was a deeply disappointing one...Our  legal advice was that our ability to do this was in the current law, we were  advised that our legal case was strong, we were advised that our legal case  was strong in part because the courts have considered similar questions in  the past and looking to those precedents we were advised that if those  precedents were followed our legal case would be a strong one. Yesterday  in the High Court what we saw was the High Court enter into a different  construction of the relevant section of the Migration Act. Effectively, if you  like, yesterday the refugee and asylum seeker law of this country changed,  changed from how it had been known and understood before with a  different interpretation of the legislation. The High Court's decision  basically turns on its head the understanding of the law in this country prior  to yesterday's decision.9 

 2.37 However, the former Commonwealth Solicitor-General, Dr David Bennett  AC QC, did not agree:  

 [The High Court] came to one of two possible conclusions. The High Court  made no "new law" and the criticisms which have been publicly made of it  are totally unfounded...The second criticism is that the High Court "missed  an opportunity". But the court does not reason by choosing a politically

In  his Honour's view, 'the fundamental difficulty in the second plaintiff's position is that s. 6A(4)  provides that the section does not affect the operation of any other law "regulating the departure  of persons from Australia". Section 198A is a law of that kind': per Heydon J at 198.

 preferred result and endeavouring to reach it in some legal way. Such a  process would be improper and contrary to the rule of law.10 

 Implications of the High Court's decision on other offshore processing  options  

 2.38 The Coalition opposes the Malaysian Arrangement and has consistently urged  the Australian Government to reinstate the successful border protection policies of the  Howard Government. This includes offshore processing on Nauru, temporary  protection visas and turning boats around where it is safe to do so. 

 2.39 On 2 September 2011, legal opinion prepared for, and released by, the  Australian Government by the current Solicitor-General, Mr Stephen Gageler SC, and  two other senior counsel, Mr Stephen Lloyd SC and Mr Geoffrey Kennett SC,  examined the implications of the High Court's ruling on offshore processing in Nauru  and Papua New Guinea (PNG): 

 In the light of Plaintiff M70 we do not have reasonable confidence on the  material with which we have been briefed that the power conferred by  s 198A could currently be exercised to take asylum seekers from Australia  to either Nauru or to PNG for determination of their refugee status. The  accession of Nauru to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees  (Refugees Convention) and the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees  (Protocol) on 28 June 2011 nevertheless raises the possibility that the power  conferred by s 198A would in the future be available to be exercised to take  asylum seekers from Australia to Nauru for determination of their refugee  status. We would have confidence that the power conferred by s 198A  would be available to be exercised to take asylum seekers from Australia to  Nauru only if it were able to be demonstrated to the satisfaction of an  Australian court: first, that appropriate arrangements were in place to ensure  practical compliance by Nauru with its obligations under the Convention  and the Protocol; and, secondly, that Nauru in its treatment of asylum  seekers and refugees complied in practice with human rights standards  acceptable at least to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  These are complex issues of fact and degree requiring detailed assessment  and analysis. Even when that assessment and analysis was complete, the  issues might well be the subject of contested evidence. In the absence of a  detailed assessment and analysis of these issues, we are unable to form a  view as to whether either of the two conditions we have identified would be  capable of being demonstrated to the satisfaction of an Australian court.11

 2.40 In contrast, Dr David Bennett's view is that the High Court's ruling does not  necessarily preclude offshore processing in a third country and that the Solicitor-General's advice should not be regarded as conclusive because he did not have  sufficient material to draw a detailed assessment of the relevant factors. Further,  Dr Bennett believes that the newly interpreted legislative criteria would be satisfied if  Australia were to be delegated the relevant operations in a third country, as was the  case with Nauru: 

 The remaining question is what can be done. The position is complicated by  the fact that there is a passage in the judgment of the Chief Justice  suggesting that the minister needs to be satisfied on both legal compliance  and compliance on the ground.  

 The second complication is that the High Court appears to have considered  that its requirement of "legal compliance" could be met by domestic laws,  international conventions or a binding agreement with Australia.  

 Third, there is a question not answered directly by the High Court whether  compliance by the country delegating to Australia the relevant operations is  sufficient to satisfy the criteria (as was achieved with Nauru). In my view it  is.  

 Having said this, there is no legal reason why steps could not be taken with  Nauru, Papua New Guinea or Malaysia (or indeed any other willing partner  country), which would enable the minister to declare them satisfactory. It is  significant that Nauru has now acceded to the Convention Relating to the  Status of Refugees and the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.  Much attention to detail would be required. In particular, any agreement  with Australia should, unlike the agreement with Malaysia, be expressed to  be legally binding.  

 The Solicitor-General's advice that he did not have reasonable confidence  that the power could be exercised in relation to Nauru or PNG depended on  the fact that he had not been provided with sufficient material from which a  detailed assessment of the relevant factors could be made. He does not  appear to have been asked the question at all in relation to Malaysia or  anywhere else. For these reasons, his views should not be regarded as  final.12 

 Proposed amendments to the Migration Act 

 2.41 On 12 September 2011, the Prime Minister announced that the  Australian Government would introduce legislation to enable the transfer of irregular  maritime arrivals to third countries for the processing of their asylum claims and to  'provide for the Government to proceed with transfers under the Arrangement with

 Malaysia'.13 On 16 September 2011, the Australian Government released an exposure  draft of its proposed changes to the Migration Act: the Migration Legislation  Amendment (Offshore Processing and Other Measures) Bill 2011 (Bill).14 

 2.42 On 19 September 2011, the government released a revised exposure draft.15  The revised exposure draft proposed a new subsection 198AB(1) of the  Migration Act, which provides that the Minister may, in writing, designate that a  country is an 'offshore processing country'. The only condition for the exercise of  power under proposed subsection 198AB(1) is that the Minister thinks that it is in the  'national interest' to designate the country to be an offshore processing country  (proposed new subsection 198AB(2)). 

 2.43 The revised proposed amendments to the Migration Act include two relevant  considerations to the Minister's identification of the 'national interest' when exercising  the discretion to declare a third country to be an offshore processing country, that is: 

 ï· any assurances provided by the third country that it will respect the principle  of non-refoulement; and 

 ï· any assurances provided by the third country that it will make an assessment, 

 or will permit an assessment to be made, of whether or not a transferee meets  the criteria for protection under the Refugee Convention.16 

 2.44  The Coalition identified substantial defects in the proposed legislation - in  particular, the bare requirement in the proposed amendments that the Minister need  only be satisfied that the designation of an offshore processing country is in the  'national interest'.17 The Leader of the Opposition, the Hon Tony Abbott MP  commented:

 The difficulty with the initial proposals [is] that [they] clearly [strip] out the  protections which the Howard Government had explicitly built in to the  Migration Act to ensure that people who were sent for offshore processing  did not lose ordinary human rights protections. Effectively, the proposals  that the Government put to us [on 16 September 2011] amount to offshore  dumping, not offshore processing... 

 Effectively, the new proposal that the Government has put 

 [on 19 September] concedes the force of [the Coalition's] 

 argument...without actually addressing it. What the Government's new  proposal [of 19 September] does is pay lip service to protections without  actually guaranteeing them.18 

 2.45 The Coalition sought the advice of Dr Bennett in relation to the proposed  amendments in both the first and second exposure drafts of the Bill. Dr Bennett  commented that the proposed amendments in the first exposure draft gave the Minister  'a virtually unfettered discretion as to what countries he declares', which may violate  Australia's non-refoulement obligations under the Refugee Convention.19 

 2.46 Dr Bennett advised that the corresponding provisions in the second exposure  draft are 'also wide and subjective' and would require a court reviewing the Minister's  decision 'to analyse the assurances very precisely in order to determine whether they  satisfy the statutory requirement'. Dr Bennett advised further that the proposed  provision makes 'no reference to the other [Refugee Convention] requirements, but  merely permits the Minister to have regard to them'.20 

 2.47 The Coalition has indicated that it will only support the Bill if the government  agrees to a proposed amendment which would expressly provide that, in order to  declare a third country as an 'offshore processing country' under the Migration Act,  the Minister must be satisfied that such a declaration would be in the national interest,  and the offshore processing country is a party to the Refugee Convention and  Refugee Protocol.21  

 2.48 In his advice to the Coalition, Dr Bennett noted:

 The draft Coalition amendments have the effect of directly incorporating  the provisions of the Convention by requiring, in effect, that the country be  a party to it. This is a simple, objective criterion although there might be  room for slight debate if a country were a party to the Convention or  Protocol with reservations. I do not know whether any relevant countries  are in this position.22 

 2.49 Dr Bennett concluded that the Coalition amendments provide 'more protection  for asylum-seekers than the two Government versions and [are] less likely to be the  subject of complex judicial proceedings'.23  

 2.50 On 19 September 2011, Mr Abbott reiterated Dr Bennett's advice:  

 Former Solicitor-General David Bennett AC QC has provided written  advice today on the two sets of amendments proposed by Labor as well as  the Coalition's alternative. In Mr Bennett's opinion the Coalition's plan  "provides more protection for asylum-seekers than the two Government  versions and it is less likely to be the subject of complex judicial  proceedings."24 

 2.51 On 21 September 2011, the Bill was introduced into the 

 House of Representatives.25 The Bill, as introduced, includes the provisions contained  in the second exposure draft which pertain to the designation of a third country as an  'offshore processing country' under the Migration Act.26 The 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Scott Morrison MP, has  circulated the Coalition's foreshadowed proposed amendments that he will move on  behalf of the Coalition in the House of Representatives.27

 CHAPTER 3 

 Key concerns 

 Introduction 

 3.1 During the committee's inquiry, submissions and witnesses raised a number of  serious concerns in relation to the Malaysian Arrangement and the 

 Operational Guidelines; indeed, all those who provided comment on the arrangement  expressed their opposition to it in absolute terms.  

 3.2 Some of the key concerns raised during the course of the inquiry were: 

 ï· the non-legally binding nature of the arrangement;  

 ï· problems relating to the practical implementation of the arrangement,  including a lack of appropriate oversight and monitoring mechanisms;  

 ï· the non-compliance of the arrangement with international law obligations and  human rights standards;  

 ï· inadequate conditions in Malaysia for asylum seekers and refugees;  

 ï· insufficient protections for unaccompanied minors transferred under the  arrangement; and 

 ï· the 'swap' aspect of the arrangement that would see 800 asylum seekers going  to Malaysia, in exchange for the resettlement in Australia of 4,000 refugees  from Malaysia.  

 Non-legally binding nature of the Malaysian Arrangement 

 3.3 One of the overarching concerns raised in submissions and evidence related to  clause 16 of the Malaysian Arrangement, which provides that the arrangement  'represents a record of the Participants' intentions and political commitments but is not  legally binding on the Participants'.1 

 3.4 Human Rights Watch contended that the non-legally binding nature of the  arrangement highlights the 'unwillingness of the parties to be formally bound by its  provisions'.2 Mr Rohan Anderson from the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman  described the arrangement as 'almost aspirational' because it 'talks of commitments,  not binding obligations'.3

 Page 20 

 3.5 A number of submissions outlined the implications that the non-binding  nature of the arrangement will have on the enforceability of assurances it contains,  particularly in relation to Malaysia's obligations to respect the principle of non-refoulement and accord certain standards of treatment to the 800 asylum seekers sent  to Malaysia (Transferees).4 For example, Amnesty International Australia (Amnesty)  argued:  

 ...[T]he Arrangement is not a substitute for protections offered through  international legal instruments, nor is it sufficient to ensure the human  rights of those transferred to Malaysia will be protected, particularly in light  of Malaysia's poor human rights record.5 

 3.6 The Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) commented that it is 'not  convinced' that there are adequate safeguards in the arrangement to ensure that  Malaysia upholds its obligation to respect the principle of non-refoulement.6 In their  submission, Mr Andrew Bartlett and Ms Marianne van Galen-Dickie from the  Australian National University argued that the Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship 'cannot just be satisfied a country will act in a certain manner'. Instead: 

 ...a country must be under an obligation, either under international law or  within its own domestic legislation or from a legally binding agreement, to  provide access and protection to all persons seeking asylum within its  territory.7 

 3.7 Professor Ben Saul directed the committee to recent case law in respect of so-called 'diplomatic assurances': 

 In recent years there has been this practice of one state giving a diplomatic  assurance to another state that a certain person, if returned to that country,  will not be mistreated or treated inhumanely or in a degrading way and so  forth. The UN Human Rights Committee, in numerous cases in the last few  years...has said that if these kinds of political agreements or assurances are  the basis underlying the return of a person where there is a risk of inhuman  or degrading treatment or torture and so on there have to be sufficiently  enforceable guarantees and monitoring to uphold those agreements... 

 In those UN Human Rights Committee cases and a number of European  Court of Human Rights cases, states have been found to be in violation of  international law because these assurances have not been accompanied by  sufficient binding enforceable safeguards.8

 3.8 In terms of the courses of action open to Australia in the event that Malaysia  breaches the arrangement, the Refugee Council of Australia observed: 

 Neither the arrangement itself nor the operational guidelines stipulate a  course of action should either party fail to uphold the specified standards,  nor do they outline avenues for seeking recourse if transferees are subject to  treatment which violates the arrangement.9 

 3.9 The Commonwealth and Immigration Ombudsman (Ombudsman),  Mr Allan Asher, advised the committee that it is his expectation that the  Joint Committee and the Advisory Committee to be established under the arrangement  should have a role 'at the very least [in providing] a level of supervision [and] a level  of scrutiny that is no less than would apply in Australia'. However, the Ombudsman  conceded that because the arrangement is not legally binding, there would be no steps  that could be taken by the Joint Committee or the Advisory Committee to bring about  a resolution in the event of any breach of the arrangement: 

 At most, we could draw it to the attention of the parliament and the  government that there do appear to be administrative shortfalls in the  [arrangement].10 

 Practical implementation of the Malaysian Arrangement 

 3.10 A number of concerns were expressed during the inquiry with respect to the  practical implementation of the arrangement.  

 Oversight and monitoring 

 3.11 Although the Malaysian Arrangement and the Operational Guidelines provide  for the establishment of the Joint Committee and the Advisory Committee,11  submissions and evidence were critical of the oversight and monitoring provided for  in the arrangement and, in particular, the practical extent to which any oversight might  be conducted in Malaysia.12  

 3.12 For example, Liberty Victoria argued that the level of oversight and  monitoring is 'insufficient' and would contain 'no scope for transparency,  accountability or independent review of the arrangement'.13 The Australian Human

 Page 22 

 Rights Commission (AHRC) noted that the arrangement does not provide oversight  and monitoring of the transit or detention centres.14 

 3.13 Several submissions expressed concerns about the level of scrutiny for  offshore processing and the lack of an independent or external complaints-handling  mechanism. These submissions proposed that an external Australian body should have  oversight and monitoring responsibilities of offshore processing arrangements.15  For example, the International Commission for Jurists (Australia) (ICJA) suggested: 

 ...some level of parliamentary, Ministerial or standing committee scrutiny,  that can effectively monitor compliance with proposed [offshore]  arrangements... 

 [I]f any [offshore] arrangement is to proceed, an independent or external  complaints-handling mechanism ought to be established to oversee the  entire arrangement...[C]omplaints procedures should also be made widely  known to asylum seekers.16 

 3.14 Mr Andrew Bartlett echoed the call to add independent oversight, suggesting  that the Ombudsman or the AHRC would be an appropriate body.17 

 3.15 The Ombudsman, whose role includes oversight of immigration detention,  refugee assessment, and review processing of irregular maritime arrivals, also  emphasised the importance of scrutiny measures and indicated that he saw a role for  his office in monitoring the arrangement: 

 Importantly, the jurisdiction of my office is not geographically limited; it  extends to actions by Australian officials overseas as well as contracted  service providers who act for and on behalf of the government. I believe my  office is also well placed to provide independent advice and oversight on  immigration matters including, importantly, issues relating to the treatment  of irregular maritime arrivals. 

 … 

 The need for oversight is particularly important in areas of administration  where opportunities for judicial review are limited and where there may be  some concern within the community about how government policy will be  implemented.18

 Pre-transfer arrangements 

 3.16 Concerns were raised that, at the time of the signing of the arrangement, the  details for the pre-transfer assessment of the vulnerability of asylum seekers to be  transferred to Malaysia had not been finalised.19 

 3.17 The Ombudsman pointed to the lack of detail included in the arrangement,  noting that there were a number of 'gaps' and insufficient documentation to provide  assurance regarding the pre-transfer arrangements.20 Further, the Ombudsman noted  that assurances of safety are especially important in relation to circumstances 'where  there are special obligations for unaccompanied minors, for victims of torture and  people who have come to Australia with pre-existing mental illnesses' because they  are 'exceptional vulnerable individuals'. Accordingly, relevant procedures relating to  such persons need to be 'much more clearly elaborated and published'.21 

 3.18 Professor Jane McAdam explained that the principle of non-refoulement  requires a case-by-case assessment of the future safety of the individual involved, and  an assessment of their 'individual protection needs' prior to being transferred to  Malaysia, so as to prevent direct refoulement to Malaysia.22 However, neither the  arrangement nor the Operational Guidelines provide for a proper legal assessment of  individuals' claims for protection prior to removal from Australia.23 

 3.19 The Refugee Council of Australia argued that inappropriate or unsuitable pre-transfer processes may result in actual harm to vulnerable asylum seekers if they are  transferred to a 'situation where their safety cannot be assured or where adequate  protection and assistance may not be available'.24 

 3.20 ICJA recommended that asylum seekers should be given access to health and  welfare professionals who are independent of the decision-making process: 

 The ICJA submits that where any arrangement involving [offshore]  processing is approved, that asylum-seekers be given access to medical  practitioners, psychologists and lawyers who are independent of the  decision-making process. The ICJA further submits due to the

 vulnerabilities of asylum-seekers, advocates representing asylum-seekers  are a necessity, not an option.25 

 3.21 The Coalition for Asylum Seekers, Refugees and Detainees (CARAD) argued  that departmental officers may not have suitable qualifications to assess the  vulnerability of asylum seekers, and proposed that decisions made about the status of  asylum seekers should be made by medical and child protection professionals.26 

 Mechanisms for appeal 

 3.22 Submissions criticised the lack of provision in the Malaysian Arrangement of  mechanisms to appeal removal decisions. Liberty Victoria, among others, condemned  this omission, arguing that it is 'clearly unacceptable'.27 

 3.23 The Law Council of Australia noted that Article 13 of the International  Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) provides that any person, prior to  being expelled from a country, should be able to have their expulsion reviewed and to  be represented in such a review: 

 The fact that the [Malaysian Arrangement] makes no reference to any such  review process or to access to representation indicates that it is inconsistent  with Australia's obligations under the ICCPR. It also appears to be  inconsistent with the Refugee Convention.28 

 3.24 The Hon John Dowd AO QC, President of the ICJA, also condemned the lack  of appeal or review measures, and the consequent risk of refoulement: 

 ...[T]his arrangement does not protect non-refoulement. In fact, it gives the  right to Malaysia, under the arrangements, to send people back to their  country of origin if they are not assessed to be refugees, and there is not  necessarily a proper appeal mechanism, because there are mechanics that  need to be worked out. Many of the people that are sent back to countries  such as Sri Lanka, Afghanistan or wherever they come from will be  subjected to torture, detention and in some cases death.29

 Access to independent legal advice 

 3.25 Submitters also commented on the lack of information available as to whether  Transferees would be able to access independent legal advice under the arrangement.30 

 3.26 For example, Professor Ben Saul cited access to a lawyer, and recording of  any interviews, as one of the safeguards necessary to adhere to international law.31  The Law Council of Australia highlighted the continuing need for Transferees to have  access to legal assistance in Malaysia if they are found not to be refugees by the  UNHCR and are subject to deportation from Malaysia.32 

 3.27 Australian Lawyers for Human Rights noted that asylum seekers are only  afforded access to lawyers pursuant to section 256 of the Migration Act if they ask for  them, and there is no obligation to advise detainees of their rights under section 256.33 

 Compliance with international law obligations and human rights standards 

 3.28 The arrangement is expressed as being 'subject to the respective Participant's  relevant international law obligations, in accordance with the applicable international  law instruments or treaties to which the Participant is a Party'.34  

 3.29 Australia's international legal obligations relevant to the arrangement arise  principally under treaties to which Australia is a party, and which have been ratified  by Australia.35 The major international law obligations identified by submitters and  witnesses36 are contained in the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees 

 

 30  See, for example, ACT Refugee Action Group, Submission 5, p. 15; AHRC, Submission 18,  p. 12, which noted that the Arrangement makes 'no provision for even basic assistance in  accessing legal advice or advocacy'. See also Refugee Council of Australia, Submission 17,  p. 11, which recommended 'immediate clarification' on a number of issues, including access to  legal advice.

 (Refugee Convention)37 and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees (Refugee  Protocol).38 Key obligations are: 

 ï· the obligation of non-refoulement, which prohibits the expulsion or return  (refouler) of a refugee, in any manner whatsoever, to the frontiers of  territories where his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of  his or her race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group  or political opinion;39 and 

 ï· the obligations of non-discrimination and non-penalty for unlawful arrival, 

 which prohibit: 

 ï· discrimination against refugees on the basis of race, religion or country  of origin;40 and 

 ï· the imposition of penalties upon refugees who arrive in Australia  unlawfully, provided that they have come directly from a territory in  which their life or freedom was threatened, and they present themselves  without delay to the authorities in Australia.41 

 3.30 The process of transfer and the conditions in Malaysia were highlighted as  areas in which Australia may be in breach of human rights standards and international  law obligations.42 These obligations arise principally under treaties which require that  certain minimum treatment standards are afforded to refugees or asylum seekers who  arrive in Australia. These include: 

 ï· specific obligations under the Refugee Convention, including to provide  access to the courts, primary education, work, housing, freedom of religion,  non-discrimination on the basis of race, religion or country of origin in the  application of the Convention, freedom of association and movement, and the

 Obligation of non-refoulement 

 3.31 The incompatibility of the Malaysian Arrangement with Australia's non-refoulement obligations was the subject of considerable evidence during the inquiry.50  Submitters and witnesses identified areas of major inconsistency between the  arrangement, and the risks of both direct and indirect refoulement. Direct refoulement

 refers to the risk that Transferees may be exposed to persecution in Malaysia. Indirect  refoulement refers to the risk that Transferees may be returned to their country of  persecution following their transfer to Malaysia.51 

 3.32 In addition to the obligation in Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention,  submitters and witnesses identified further non-refoulement obligations to which  Australia is subject, which extend beyond threats to a person's life or liberty,  including: 

 ï· a prohibition on refoulement under Article 3 of CAT, where there are 

 substantial grounds for believing that a person would be in danger of being  subjected to torture on his or her return;52 

 ï· a prohibition on refoulement arising from Articles 6 and 7 of the ICCPR and 

 Article 5(b) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms  of Racial Discrimination,53 which have been interpreted by the United Nations  Human Rights Committee as prohibiting the removal of a person to another  country in circumstances where there is a real risk that his or her rights under  those covenants will be violated;54 and 

 ï· a prohibition under the CRC on the return of a child to a country where there  are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk of irreparable  harm to the child.55 

 Direct refoulement 

 3.33 On the basis of evidence received, it is clear that the arrangement may  contravene Australia's obligations to prevent the direct refoulement of Transferees  since the blanket designation of Malaysia as a 'safe' third country under section 198A  of the Migration Act is inconsistent with Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention.  The committee was informed that the obligation of non-refoulement requires a case-by-case determination that a particular country is safe for a particular individual.56 

 

 51  This broad categorisation was articulated by the Australian Refugee Law Academics,  Submission 25, pp 10-13. See further, Professor Jane McAdam, Committee Hansard,  23 September 2011, p. 12.

 3.34 Provisions of the arrangement which purport to discharge Australia's  obligations to avoid direct refoulement do not appear to guarantee that an  appropriately rigorous approach will be taken in making case-by-case determinations  as to whether Malaysia is a safe country for individual Transferees. For example, the  group of academics specialising in refugee law (Australian Refugee Law Academics)  were critical of clause 9(3) of the arrangement and Item 1 of the 

 Operational Guidelines. Clause 9(3) provides that Australia will implement  'appropriate pre-screening mechanisms in accordance with international standards  before a transfer is effected', and item 1 of the Operational Guidelines sets out certain  pre-screening and assessment tasks.57 

 3.35 The Australian Refugee Law Academics argued that these provisions are  inadequate because they do not provide transparent or comprehensive assessment  criteria. The academics also noted that 'the Operational Guidelines stipulate only the  gathering of biodata, basic security checks and fitness to travel assessments' and do  not provide for 'a proper legal assessment of individuals' claims for protection'.58 

 3.36 Several submitters and witnesses also expressed the view that the following  factors create a real risk that Transferees may be subjected to direct refoulement in  Malaysia - that is, treatment in breach of their rights under treaties including the  Refugee Convention, CAT, the ICCPR, the ICESCR and the CRC: 

 ï· the arrangement is not legally binding on Malaysia, meaning that there are no 

 enforceable safeguards against the risk of refoulement.59 

 ï· Malaysia is not a signatory to the same treaties as Australia which contain 

 non-refoulement obligations - in particular, Malaysia is not a signatory to the  Refugee Convention, CAT, the ICCPR or the ICESCR and, although  Malaysia is a signatory to the CRC, it has made substantial reservations in  respect of many Articles;60 

 ï· Malaysia lacks domestic legislation which provides equivalent legal rights 

 and protections to Transferees, to those contained in the relevant treaties;61  and 

 ï· Malaysia has a documented history of ill-treatment and discrimination 

 towards asylum seekers and refugees.62

 3.37 The Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) expressed concern that  there are inadequate provisions in the arrangement for Transferees who are found by  Malaysia not to satisfy the criteria in the Refugee Convention, but who may have  complementary protection needs: that is, such persons may be in need of protection  under other human rights conventions to which Australia is a party. The AHRC's view  was that the arrangement contains inadequate operational details as to how claims for  protection in these circumstances would be assessed,63 and this lack of detail fails to 

 safeguard against the risk of refoulement of such Transferees.64  

 Indirect refoulement 

 3.38 Submitters also argued that the arrangement fails to safeguard against the risk  that Malaysia may return Transferees to their countries of persecution. In particular,  Australia's obligations to prevent indirect refoulement require it to ensure that  Transferees have access to 'fair and efficient procedures' in Malaysia for determining  their refugee status. The arrangement fails to establish such procedures because: 

 ï· Malaysia lacks an adequate domestic procedure, guaranteed by law, for 

 making refugee status determinations, and its undertaking to respect the  principle of non-refoulement in clause 10(2) of the arrangement is not legally  binding;65 

 ï· under the arrangement, the UNHCR is merely permitted, at the grace of the  Malaysian Government, to conduct such determinations. As a non-state party,  the UNHCR lacks the resources of government to conduct assessments and is  unable to guarantee that the Transferees whom it assesses as meeting the  criteria of the Refugee Convention will not be refouled by the 

 Malaysian Government;66 and 

 ï· notwithstanding that the principle of non-refoulement is part of customary 

 international law, Malaysia has a history of non compliance. For example, the

 Australian Refugee Law Academics referred to reports of the refoulement of  Uighurs from Malaysia, after the signing of the arrangement.67 

 Obligations of non-discrimination and non-penalty for unlawful arrival 

 3.39 Several submitters and witnesses argued that the arrangement is inconsistent  with Australia's obligations under Articles 3 and 31 of the Refugee Convention not to  discriminate against refugees on the basis of race, religion or country of origin; or to  penalise refugees and - by extension - asylum seekers, for the unlawful manner of  their arrival in Australia.68 

 3.40 In particular, the arrangement subjects Transferees to conditions less  favourable than those afforded to persons whose protection applications are processed  in Australia, which may constitute a penalty under Article 31.69 Specific instances of  less favourable treatment include: 

 ï· the mandatory detention of Transferees in Australia pending their transfer to 

 Malaysia, and the refusal of the Australian Government to process their  applications for protection in Australia;70 

 ï· the removal of Transferees from Australia for processing (and potentially 

 long-term residence) in Malaysia (which, as noted above, has a history of  ill-treatment towards refugees and asylum seekers);71 and 

 ï· the potential liability of certain Transferees to criminal sanctions under  Malaysian law because they have travelled through Malaysia illegally on their  way to Australia.72

The Law Society  of NSW, Submission 23, p. 3 expressed uncertainty as to whether the Arrangement imposes a  penalty, but stated that it does place Transferees in a position of 'great disadvantage and  vulnerability'.

 Conditions in Malaysia 

 3.41 According to the UNHCR, there are approximately 90,000 refugees and  asylum seekers currently in Malaysia.73 Several submissions provided the committee  with evidence of the conditions for, and treatment of, refugees and asylum seekers in 

 Malaysia.74 

 3.42 Amnesty International Australia (Amnesty) and Dr Judyth Watson, a  CARAD Board member, provided detailed information on the conditions and issues  which confront asylum seekers and refugees in Malaysia: 

 ï· Malaysian law does not distinguish between illegal migrant workers and  asylum seekers/refugees as there is no legislative framework with respect to  refugees. Asylum seekers and refugees have no right to do paid work are often  forced to work in dangerous and dirty jobs, subject to exploitation, and risk  arrest by police and immigration officials in order to survive. 

 ï· Asylum seekers and refugees are at risk of detention or arrest. People in 

 breach of Malaysia's immigration laws are detained in overcrowded centres,  then sentenced to jail. They are also often forced to pay fines.  

 ï· Regular immigration raids and arrests are carried out by state agents and by a 

 volunteer citizens' police force, the People's Volunteer Corps (Ikatan Relawan  Rakyat or RELA). 

 ï· Refugees and asylum seekers in Malaysia are regularly subjected to  mistreatment in Malaysian detention centres.  

 ï· Malaysian authorities engage in the practice of caning. In 2002, the Malaysian 

 Government passed a law endorsing caning as a form of punishment for  immigration violations. With no option but to violate immigration laws (such  as having to work), asylum seeker and refugees in Malaysia regularly risk  being caned.

 Page 33 

 ï· Refugees and asylum-seekers in Malaysia are vulnerable to abuse and 

 violence in their homes, in public, and at their places of work because they  have no rights and little protection.75 

 3.43 Amnesty has produced a report which details the torture and other  mistreatment that refugees and asylum seekers are subjected to in Malaysia. In  particular, Amnesty notes the risk of, and injuries sustained from, caning: 

 Illegal entry and re-entry to Malaysia after deportation are punishable by  caning. Refugees and asylum seekers...are at risk of caning. 

 ... 

 Those who are convicted of illegal entry are normally caned up to three  times, although the law allows for them to be caned up to six times. The  cane cuts through the skin and leaves scars that are visible months later.76 

 3.44 Amnesty's report also highlights the involvement of RELA in immigration  raids and checks: 

 RELA's approach is particularly problematic, consisting of crude profiling  based on apparent race or ethnicity, and a general attitude of "arrest now,  investigate later". These largely untrained RELA agents frequently subject  the people they arrest to humiliation, physical abuse, theft and extortion.77 

 3.45 The Darwin Asylum Seeker Support and Advocacy Network (DASSAN)  provided an account from refugee, R, who is now living in Darwin, of his experiences  in Malaysian detention camps: 

 ...R experienced raids by Malaysian authorities during which he was  physically abused, with excessive punching and kicking, and was arrested. 

 ... 

 In relation to conditions in the detention camps in Malaysia, R reports that  there was overcrowding, physical abuse by the authorities directed toward  the refugees, sexual harassment and insufficient food and drinking water.

Amnesty International  goes on to note that in July 2009 it was informed by the Director General of Immigration that  RELA's role in immigration enforcement would end in July 2009. At the time of writing of  Amnesty International's report (June 2010), RELA continued to operate in that capacity.  

 Page 34 

 These conditions lead to malnutrition, mental damage and some detainees  contracting tuberculosis.78 

 Standards of treatment  

 3.46 Pursuant to the arrangement, the Malaysian Government has made certain  commitments with respect to asylum seekers transferred from Australia, including: 

 ï· facilitation of the lawful presence of Transferees in Malaysia; 79  and 

 ï· acknowledgement that Transferees will enjoy standards of treatment  consistent with those set out in the Operational Guidelines.80 

 3.47 The Operational Guidelines provide that the lawful presence of the  Transferees in Malaysia will be facilitated through an exemption under the Malaysian  Immigration Act.81 

 3.48 The arrangement provides that 'Transferees...will be treated with dignity and  respect and in accordance with human rights standards'.82 The Operational Guidelines  provide that, following departure from the Transit Centre, 'Transferees will enjoy an  adequate standard of treatment including having access to the same support as other  asylum seekers and refugees in the community'. In limited circumstances, 'modest'  backup safety-net provisions will be available through IOM on an 'as needs' basis.83  The Operational Guidelines make specific provisions for accommodation,84 self-reliance opportunities,85 education,86 and medical services.87 

 Compliance with human rights standards 

 3.49 A number of submissions highlighted the lack of enforceability of the  standards of treatment contained in the Malaysian Arrangement and the Operational  Guidelines, because neither the arrangement nor the Operational Guidelines are  legally binding.88

 Page 35 

 3.50 Aside from the lack of enforceability of the standards of treatment, submitters  also remarked that the standards provided for in the arrangement and the  Operational Guidelines do not meet international law obligations or human rights  standards.89 

 3.51 In relation to the provision of education, the Refugee Council of Australia  argued that the standard under the Malaysian Arrangement falls well short of  obligations under the Refugee Convention: 

 ...[T]he operational guidelines stipulate that transferees of school age will  have access to private education (presumably at their own cost) or, where  such arrangements are not available or affordable, to informal educational  arrangements. 

 This is a far lower standard than that required by the Refugee Convention,  which stipulates that refugees should have access to elementary education  on the same basis as nationals.90 

 3.52 Human Rights Watch noted that '[n]either private education nor informal  education meet the standards for the right to free and compulsory primary education in  article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which both Australia and  Malaysia are parties'.91 

 3.53 With respect to the standards for the provision of healthcare, the AHRC  referred to the provisions in the ICESCR and the CRC which provide that all people  have a right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health: 

 Despite this, the operational guidelines state simply that 'Transferees will  have access to basic medical care under arrangements UNHCR has for  asylum seekers and refugees with some private clinics' and that 'existing  IOM arrangements with a private hospital' will be used when emergency  medical assistance is required. 

 Neither the arrangement nor the guidelines make mention of timeframes for  the provision of health services; provision of specialist medical care; access  to dental care; access to mental health care; or access to torture and trauma  counselling.92 

 3.54 In addition, the AHRC highlighted concerns that it has regarding standards of  housing and employment for Transferees to Malaysia: 

 International human rights standards provide that everyone is entitled to an  adequate standard of living for themselves and their families, including  adequate food, clothing and housing. It is not clear whether appropriate

 provision will be made in this regard for people transferred to Malaysia.  The operational guidelines state that people who are transferred will be  provided with basic accommodation and a subsistence allowance for one  month, after which time they are expected to become self-sufficient through  employment and move into private accommodation. While the guidelines  provide for some assistance to be provided to needy asylum seekers by the  [IOM and the UNHCR] after this initial period, there is a lack of clarity  about the circumstances in which such assistance will be provided and the  form that it will take...[I]t also appears that asylum seekers transferred to  Malaysia may not receive formal work permits which would ensure their  legal right to employment. In these circumstances, it is unlikely that people  transferred to Malaysia would have any industrial safeguards or avenues or  recourse, for example, in the event that their employer refuses to pay  them.93 

 Other issues 

 3.55 Mr Andrew Bartlett commented on the role that the UNHCR and IOM will be  required to fulfil in assisting the 800 Transferees, expressing concern that these  organisations may not have adequate resources in Malaysia to engage in this role.94  The group of Australian Refugee Law Academics also observed: 

 Much of the assistance provided for by the [Operational] Guidelines is to be  delivered by UNHCR or IOM. Indeed, the Arrangement was concluded 'on  the basis that UNHCR and [IOM] can fulfil the roles and functions  envisaged in the Operational Guidelines'. The resources of these  organisations, particularly UNHCR, are extremely limited.95 

 3.56 Concerns have been expressed that the Malaysian Arrangement creates a  'two tiered refugee system' in Malaysia.96 Dr Judyth Watson from CARAD,  for example, has noted that the 800 Transferees are already being referred to as 'gold  card' holders.97 Similarly, Human Rights Watch, while welcoming the Malaysian

 Government's recognition of asylum seekers as being lawfully present in that  jurisdiction, nevertheless articulated its opposition to the arrangement: 

 [I]t is unacceptable to create a special exception for 800 people because  they are being swapped when some 90,000 other refugees and asylum  seekers living in Malaysia—with similar claims and vulnerability—remain  as 'illegal migrants' under Malaysian law, subject to arrest, detention, and  deportation.98 

 Unaccompanied minors 

 3.57 Several submitters raised concerns about the implication of sending  unaccompanied minors to Malaysia, describing the situation variously as 'dire',99  'grim',100 and a 'real threat to the welfare of child transferees'.101 The welfare of  unaccompanied minors at both the pre- and post-transfer stages was of greatest  concern. 

 3.58 For example, the AHRC submitted that - in addition to the possibility that  such a transfer may breach certain fundamental rights of the child, including those  relating to non-refoulement, liberty, and access to healthcare and education - the  arrangement does not clearly detail the guardianship arrangements for unaccompanied  minors in Malaysia: 

 The operational guidelines anticipate that people transferred under the  arrangement will be 'handed over' to Malaysian authorities upon arrival in  Malaysia. From that point, unaccompanied minors will be beyond the care  and custody of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, who is their  guardian under Australian law. In contrast to Australian law, Malaysian law  permits, but does not require, the appointment of a guardian in respect of  persons seeking asylum who are unaccompanied minors. It is unclear what  arrangements have been made for the appointment of a guardian for any  children transferred under the arrangement. 

 In short, unaccompanied minors transferred under the arrangement would  be sent to a country with a poor record for the treatment of asylum seekers  and refugees, in the absence of clear, mandated arrangements for their  guardianship, care and custody. The [AHRC] is gravely concerned about  the fate of any unaccompanied child placed into these circumstances.102

 3.59 Submitters identified additional weaknesses in the detail of the Malaysian  Arrangement concerning unaccompanied minors, such as: 

 ï· the arrangement does not - and cannot, on account of its non-legally binding  nature - provide a guarantee that Malaysia will adhere to its international and  domestic legal obligations in respect of unaccompanied minors;103 and 

 ï· Malaysia is not, in any event, under a domestic legal obligation to appoint a 

 guardian to unaccompanied minors who are transferred under the  arrangement, but is merely invested with the discretion do so.104 

 3.60 Some submitters and witnesses also argued that the Minister has conflicting  roles in relation to unaccompanied minors, due to the Minister's role as their legal  guardian on the one hand, and as immigration decision-maker on the other.105  

 3.61 Liberty Victoria commented on the apparently conflicting nature of the  Minister's duties as guardian - that is 'nurturer and protector' - and 

 Immigration Minister - that is, 'detainer, immigration decision-maker [and]  deporter'.106 Australian Lawyers for Human Rights expressed similar concerns: 

 In the course of the proceedings before the High Court, it became clear that  there was little in place in Malaysia to respond to the particular needs of  unaccompanied minors. Given the onerous responsibilities that the Minister  for Immigration holds as legal guardian of unaccompanied minors, any  attempt at legislative amendments to relieve him of those responsibilities in  order to effect the transfer of unaccompanied minors manifestly not in their  best interests would itself conflict with his 'best interests' responsibilities 

 

 103  See, for example, ICJA, Submission 4, p. 10; Castan Centre for Human Rights Law,  Submission 21, pp 10-11. The committee notes, however, that the Commonwealth Ombudsman  has acknowledged 'as a positive initiative that an independent observer role is to be provided by  a service provider [to oversee the transfer of unaccompanied minors]. Under that arrangement,  the provider will be available to attend interviews with unaccompanied minors and advise the  interviewer of any concerns about the emotional and physical state of the child or young  person, to provide a reassuring and friendly presence for the child or young person, ensure his  or her understanding of the process, and otherwise to look out for his or her interest':  Ombudsman, response to question on notice, received 30 September 2011, p. 3. 

 104  AHRC, Submission 18, p. 16; DASSAN, Submission 20, p. 4. In this regard, the committee  notes advice from the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office that it is its understanding that the  arrangement envisages that unaccompanied minors entering Malaysia would fall under the  provisions of the Malaysian Child Act 2001, and that a Malaysian government official would  become their legal guardian. That official would seek a court order (within 24 hours) for the  unaccompanied minors to be placed in suitable care, including supervised group house  arrangements for older unaccompanied minors and foster care arrangements, as appropriate:  Ombudsman, response to question on notice, received 30 September 2011, p. 3.

 under article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In any other  event, it would seem inconceivable that transfer could ever be regarded as  being in the best interests of a child.107 

 3.62 A number of submissions also noted the implications of the High Court's  decision, namely:  

 ï· an unaccompanied minor may not lawfully be taken from Australia without  the Minister's written consent provided specifically under the Guardianship of  Children Act; and 

 ï· administrative decisions made under the Guardianship of Children Act 

 concerning the transfer of unaccompanied minors are amenable to judicial  review.108 

 Resettlement of 4,000 refugees in Australia 

 3.63 Submitters and witnesses generally welcomed the provision in clause 5 of the  Malaysian Arrangement for the resettlement of 4,000 refugees from Malaysia to  Australia over a four-year term. However, many were critical of the 'swap' effected by  this provision when operating in combination with clause 4, which enables the transfer  of 800 asylum seekers to Malaysia.109 For example, Amnesty argued: 

 While increasing resettlement numbers directly from Malaysia is a  welcome move, there is no need for Australia to link this increase with the  expulsion of 800 asylum seekers who have arrived here by boat.110 

 3.64 The Refugee Council of Australia described the resettlement of 4,000  refugees in Australia as a 'potentially positive aspect of the arrangement', but  expressed concern that the 'swap' effected by clauses 4 and 5 'sets a number of  problematic precedents'. In particular, it argued that this aspect of the arrangement  fails to adopt a protection-centred approach to resettlement: 

 The arrangement with Malaysia undermines the principle that resettlement,  while it can be used strategically, is first and foremost a mechanism for  protection. UNHCR maintains that, even in cases where resettlement is  used as a strategic tool, 'the first purpose of resettlement must always be the

 provision of individual protection for those who cannot be provided secure  asylum in a first asylum country'. 

 The provisions of the arrangement, however, do not reflect this principle.  The operational guidelines stipulate that the 4,000 persons resettled 'must  be able to establish they entered Malaysia and were registered by UNHCR  prior to the date of signing of the Arrangement and have remained in  Malaysia'. The resettlement allocation will not, therefore, include refugees  who arrived in Malaysia after the arrangement was finalised or any of the  800 transferees - even if they are considered by UNHCR to be priority  cases for resettlement.111 

 3.65 The committee also heard evidence about the Department's approach to  counting the number of refugees to be resettled in Australia under clause 5 of the  Malaysian Arrangement. An officer from the Department stated that the arrangement  operates in tandem with Australia's existing humanitarian resettlement program,  explaining that the 4,000 refugees resettled from Malaysia under the arrangement (at a  rate of 1,000 refugees per year) will be additional to intakes under the existing  resettlement program from Malaysia (currently 200-500 refugees per year).112  According to the Department, this means that Australia will offer a global total of  14,750 resettlement places annually over the term of the Malaysian Arrangement.113 

 3.66 The departmental officer advised the committee that the government has not  put in place any process to identify the refugees resettled pursuant to the arrangement  (that is, the additional 1,000 places per year).114 Rather, the 1,000 new places are  added to the existing resettlement intake of around 200-500 places, to create a total  figure in respect of Malaysia. The officer stated that the Department will report figures  on the number of refugees being resettled out of Malaysia, and anticipates that the  annual total 'will be somewhere between 1,300 and 1,500 depending on what UNHCR  global priorities and processing deliver'.115 

 Due to this intermixing of resettlement numbers, departmental representatives were  unable to provide the committee with any information at the public hearing on how  many refugees - if any - have been resettled pursuant to the arrangement.116 An  officer of the Department advised that the first 1,000 refugees resettled from Malaysia  will be deemed to be the 1,000 resettled under the Malaysian Arrangement.117

 CHAPTER 4 

 Committee view and recommendations 

 4.1 In the committee's view, the terms of the Malaysian Arrangement and the  associated Operational Guidelines, along with their practical implementation, are  fundamentally and irreversibly flawed. In particular, the committee strongly believes  that the Malaysian Arrangement is lacking in significant detail and, most importantly,  fails to address serious human rights issues. 

 Non-legally binding nature of the Malaysian Arrangement  

 4.2 At its most basic level, the arrangement is inadequate and unacceptable  because it is extraordinarily imprecise in nature, and includes the use of vague  language and terms which are not defined and which appear only to reflect the  'political commitments' of the parties. Since the Malaysian Arrangement is non-legally  binding, there is absolutely no means to enforce the obligations of the parties under  the arrangement.  

 4.3 Malaysia has apparently undertaken major obligations in relation to the  principle of non-refoulement of asylum seekers; to treat asylum seekers with dignity  and respect and in accordance with human rights standards; and to deal with the  special needs of vulnerable cases, including unaccompanied minors.1 However, the  Australian Government is powerless in the event that Malaysia does not comply with  the arrangement. As the Ombudsman highlighted to the committee, there are no steps  which can be taken by the Joint Committee or the Advisory Committee - the only  bodies likely to be providing any form of oversight or monitoring of the arrangement  - in the event that there is any breach of the arrangement.  

 4.4 The committee is not satisfied with assertions made by the Department that 'a  number of the arrangements and understandings that Australia has entered into are not  in fact legally binding',2 and that '[i]t is not in the interest of either government that the  arrangement not be successfully implemented' because both governments entered into  the arrangement in good faith with the intention of meeting their respective  commitments.3 The arrangement itself needs to include sufficient, binding and  enforceable safeguards. A clause providing for the resolution of differences ('to be  resolved as soon as reasonably practicable by consultation between the parties') -  which is apparently how the Australian Government envisages breaches by Malaysia  will be addressed - is simply not adequate.

 Malaysia is not a party to the Refugee Convention 

 4.5 In terms of selecting Malaysia as the location to process the protection claims  of the 800 Transferees, the Australian Government has completely ignored that  Malaysia is not a party to the Refugee Convention. 

 4.6 The committee accepts the advice of the Department that it is a 'long  understood position' that the Refugee Convention does not confer upon asylum  seekers a right to 'demand' that the particular contracting state in which they arrive  must process their claim and, if upheld, grant them a right to re-settle.4 However, at a  minimum, the Australian Government should meet the Prime Minister's previous  commitment to 'rule out' sending asylum seekers who travel to Australia by boat to  countries which are not a signatory to the Refugee Convention.5. 

 Pre-transfer arrangements 

 4.7 The Department placed significant emphasis on the pre-removal assessment in  terms of ensuring: 

 ï· the non-refoulement of a potential Transferee where that person fears  persecution in Malaysia; 

 ï· the identification of vulnerabilities and heightened risks, particularly focusing  on unaccompanied children; and 

 ï· confirming fitness to travel. 6  

 4.8 The Department noted in its supplementary submission that 'pre-removal/transfer guidelines' (Pre-removal Guidelines) have been developed.7  However, for reasons which are not apparent to the committee, the Pre-Removal  Guidelines were not been included in the arrangement. Further, the Department did  not see fit to provide a copy of the Pre-removal Guidelines to the committee as part of  its submission, nor was the Department able to provide a copy at the hearing to enable  the committee to consider the document during the course of the hearing.8 In the  committee's view, given the importance of the procedures set out in the Pre-removal

 Guidelines, this document should have been provided to the committee as soon as  possible after the hearing. Instead, the document was not provided to the committee  until a week after the hearing, as part of the Department's responses to questions taken  on notice.9 

 4.9 The committee also notes that the Commonwealth and Immigration  Ombudsman has requested a copy of the Pre-removal Guidelines and has not been  provided with a copy, even though the Ombudsman's request was made more than a  month ago.10 The Department's reluctance to provide the Pre-removal Guidelines to  the Ombudsman comes in spite of the fact that the Ombudsman's office has a statutory  responsibility for work in this area.11  

 4.10 In the absence of the Pre-removal Guidelines being available to the committee  at the hearing, members of the committee were forced to spend considerable time  questioning officers of the Department to determine the processes provided for in the  document, and how pre-removal assessments would apply in specific scenarios.12 

 Conditions in Malaysia 

 4.11 According to the Malaysian Arrangement, Malaysia is obligated to treat the  Transferees with 'dignity and respect and in accordance with human rights  standards'.13 Further, pursuant to the Operational Guidelines, 'Transferees will enjoy  an adequate standard of treatment, including having access to the same support as  other asylum seekers and refugees in the community'.14 

 4.12 Aside from the obvious issue that, due to the non-binding nature of the  arrangement, the Australian Government has no way of ensuring that these standards

 10  See Supplementary Submission 29, p. 1. 

 11  Committee Hansard, 23 September 2011, p. 10. However, the committee notes advice from the  Department that the Ombudsman withdrew the request for the guidelines in light of the  High Court case and instead requested a (second) briefing by the Department. On  22 September 2011, the Department offered to provide a (further) briefing to the Ombudsman:  DIAC, response to question on notice 35, received 30 September 2011. 

 12  See Committee Hansard, 23 September 2011, pp 42-43. The committee was told that pregnant  women and sick children would be transferred if appropriate medical assistance were in place,  but 'it would depend on the circumstances'; a diagnosis of tuberculosis would prevent a person  from being transferred because the person would not be fit to travel by plane; a person with an  adverse security assessment from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation would not  necessarily be prevented from being transferred (although a person whose name appears on a  Malaysian prohibited immigrants, terrorism, or international wanted list would not be  transferred, according to Item 1.1.2(b) of the Operational Guidelines); and a person who could  credibly claim fear of persecution in Malaysia would not be transferred. 

 13  See clause 8(1) of the arrangement.  

 14  Item 3.0 of the Operational Guidelines.  

 Page 44  

 

 of treatment are upheld in Malaysia, the committee has a number of other concerns  regarding the treatment of the asylum seekers transferred to Malaysia. 

 4.13 Conditions for refugees and asylum seekers in Malaysia are nothing short of  appalling with harassment and violence part of the refugee community's daily  experience, and the threat of arrest a constant.15 In particular, the committee is gravely  concerned at the past involvement of RELA, the volunteer citizens' police force, in  immigration matters, particularly in light of RELA's well-documented history of  extortion, intimidation, harassment and abuse of asylum seekers and refugees.  

 4.14 The committee is somewhat encouraged by evidence from the UNHCR that  'the activities of RELA have been scaled back and that the Malaysian Government is  involved in a significant initiative (6P Programme) to regularise the legal status of all  illegal migrants'. Further: 

 Many persons of concern to UNHCR stand to benefit from this Programme  by having their status regularised.  It would mean all refugees in Malaysia  would, in addition to their registration and ID documents for UNHCR, be  registered within the Government's immigration data base and thus  protected from arbitrary arrest and detention. It would also mean that all  refugees in Malaysia would have the right to work on a par with legal  migrants in the country. This would also entitle them to the same insurance  and health schemes as documented, legal migrant workers… 

 For present purposes, the Arrangements would have involved a legal status  (and documentation proof) for transferees and this, subject to adequate  monitoring and other safeguards, would have served as a significant  safeguard against any exposure to RELA or arbitrary arrest.16   

 4.15 The committee also notes the Department's advice that 'RELA are not  responsible for in any way imprisoning or incarcerating these people in Malaysia'; and  that the Undersecretary International Division, Malaysian Ministry of Home Affairs  indicated during the course of negotiations on the Malaysian Arrangement that 'RELA  are no longer involved in immigration matters', instead 'now focussing on a new  direction for the agency'.17  

 4.16 However, it is unclear what this 'new direction' is and the committee is of the  view that RELA's continuing involvement in the enforcement of immigration matters  is possible, particularly given that it is unknown how many RELA there actually are in  Malaysia. In May 2007, Human Rights Watch reported that the Malaysian  Government had authorised 'almost half a million RELA volunteers to help maintain

 public order'.18 In August 2010, Amnesty International noted that RELA aimed to  expand its membership from 1.6 million to 2.6 million by the end of 2010.19 Such  figures are extraordinary and the committee considers that it would be extremely  difficult, if not impossible, to regulate or control all aspects of RELA's activities. 

 4.17 The risk to refugees and asylum seekers of being caned in Malaysia is also a  serious concern for the committee. The committee appreciates the advice of the  Department that the exemption granted under Malaysian immigration laws to the  800 Transferees means that they will not have committed an offence, and therefore  will not be subject to caning, in relation to entering Malaysia without appropriate  documentation.20  

 4.18 However, as Amnesty has pointed out, caning is not only used for  immigration offences, it is a supplementary punishment for approximately 40 other  crimes.21 On the risks to Transferees of being punished by caning for non-immigration  related offences, a departmental representative told the committee: 

 As per normal for anyone who goes to a country like Malaysia, or to the US  or wherever, if you commit an offence you will be subject to their criminal  laws.22 

 4.19 In response to concerns raised during the inquiry about the treatment of  asylum seekers in Malaysia, another representative from the Department told the  committee:  

 Australia does not accept that it has a legal obligation that persons outside  our territory have to be accorded with the same standards of treatment in all  respects as they would have received had they remained in Australia. In the  case of transfers to countries for processing outside Australia, we have,  however, accepted a moral obligation to ensure that such people are  accorded reasonable standards of treatment.23 

 4.20 In the committee's view, if the transfer of asylum seekers to Malaysia  proceeds then the Australian Government will have failed dismally in fulfilling any

 so-called 'moral obligation'. Further, it is astonishing that the Department 'is satisfied  with assurances provided by the Malaysian [G]overnment' that caning will not occur,  at least partly on the basis that the arrangement was 'negotiated in good faith and  freely entered into by Malaysia'.24 

 Identification of the 800 Transferees 

 4.21 In relation to the ability of the 800 Transferees to be identified in Malaysia as  subject to the Malaysian Arrangement, the Department detailed the operation of the  Nexcode (Foreign Identification) label which will be affixed to the identification cards  of individuals.25 However, the Department made several significant concessions in  relation to the operation of the card. First, the Department was unable to give the  committee any assurances in relation to the safeguards built into the card to ensure the  security of the document system. Instead the Department referred to measures such as  'special printing, design and laminar surfaces that are put over the top of the card that  reflect in certain kinds of light' and concluded, on the basis of these measures, that it  was 'satisfied that there are reasonable safeguards in place to protect the use of the  card'.26 

 4.22 Second, the Department indicated that, despite the emphasis placed on the  presence of the Nexcode sticker on the card for identification purposes, only 'normal  Malaysian law enforcement and immigration authorities' will have access to the card  readers necessary to read the Nexcode sticker. The Department then went on to advise  that 'this has been structured such that you do not actually need a card reader to  identify the person as being subject to the Arrangement'.27 It is therefore not clear to  the committee why the Department has placed such an emphasis on the Nexcode  sticker as a means of identifying the 800 individuals who are subject to the  arrangement, if the card reader for the sticker is not readily available, nor in fact  necessary.  

 4.23 In the committee's view, the identification card and Nexcode sticker measures  are manifestly inadequate to ensure the identification of the 800 individuals that are  being transferred to Malaysia and to guarantee the standard of treatment which they  are to be accorded under the arrangement. This is particularly the case given the  evidence that the committee received as to the disregard which is shown for refugees  in Malaysia who have managed to be granted a UN registration card.

 Unaccompanied minors 

 4.24 In the committee's view, the provisions made under the 

 Malaysian Arrangement with respect to unaccompanied children are completely  unacceptable. 

 4.25 Specific provision needs to be made for unaccompanied minors to have  representation with respect to their legal rights during any pre-removal interview. The  committee does not take any comfort in the fact that unaccompanied children will be  accompanied at interview by an 'independent observer'.28 Nowhere in the list of roles  fulfilled by the independent observer will that person be required to advocate for the  legal rights of the child. That is the role of the child's legal guardian and, in the  committee's view, it is necessary that a person representing the child's legal interests  be present at the interview.  

 4.26 Further, explicit provision needs to be made for the transfer of guardianship of  children in Malaysia. The Australian Government simply cannot rely on an  expectation that an official of the Malaysian Government will become the guardian to  unaccompanied children. To send unaccompanied minors to Malaysia without making  detailed provision for their guardianship on arrival is a dereliction in the Minister's  duty as legal guardian of these children.  

 Recommendation 1 

 4.27 The committee recommends that the Australian Government not proceed  with the implementation of the Arrangement between the Government of Australia  and the Government of Malaysia on transfer and resettlement, due to the obvious  flaws and defects in that arrangement.

 DISSENTING REPORT BY  GOVERNMENT SENATORS  1.1 Government Senators strongly disagree with the views presented in the  committee's majority report, and do not support the majority report's recommendation.  Government Senators believe that the Malaysian Arrangement is essential to combat  the irregular movement of asylum seekers within the Asia-Pacific region.  Fundamentally, and most importantly, the arrangement is designed to break the people  smugglers' business model and deter people from taking the dangerous voyage to  Australia by sea. The very strong message that the Malaysian Arrangement sends is  'do not get on that boat because you will not be processed and resettled in Australia'. 

 1.2 The Malaysian Arrangement delivers an innovative regional solution to what  is clearly a significant regional problem. Government Senators note that the  announcement of the arrangement had a strong deterrent effect, immediately  discouraging people from making the dangerous sea journey to Australia. The timely  implementation of the Malaysian Arrangement will further strengthen the message  that people should not risk their lives coming to Australia in this way.  

 Importance of regional cooperation 

 1.3 Australia is not alone in facing problems of irregular migration, people  smuggling and substantial increases in the number of people seeking asylum.  Accordingly, Australia cannot act in isolation to address these problems.  

 1.4 Against this background, the establishment of the Regional Cooperation  Framework, at the fourth Ministerial Conference of the Bali Process on People  Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime on  30 March 2011, is an important development. The Regional Cooperation Framework,  which has broad bipartisan and international support, is based on the concept of  responsibility-sharing and cooperation between source, transit and destination  countries. It lays the foundation for the implementation of practical bilateral and sub-regional arrangements that will contribute to a sustainable regional response.1 

 1.5 The Malaysian Arrangement is an important element of the Regional  Cooperation Framework: it provides a strong signal to people smugglers, and their  potential clients, that the Australian Government will determine its asylum priorities  in an orderly manner, with priority being given under its Humanitarian Program to  people in greatest need. 

 1.6 As the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (Department) outlined in  its submission, Asia-Pacific region countries such as Thailand, Malaysia and  Indonesia host large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers. Such countries permit

 Page 50  

 

 the UNHCR to access those individuals, even though the countries are not parties to  the Refugee Convention.2 Genuine commitment to regional cooperation requires that  Australia engage with countries who are not signatories to the Refugee Convention,  but which host most of the refugees in the region.  

 1.7 Australia has made clear commitments to increase its share of the  'humanitarian burden' in the region, and the Malaysian Arrangement will facilitate  those commitments by significantly increasing Australia's refugee intake by 4,000  over the next four years. 

 Deterrent effect of the Malaysian Arrangement 

 1.8 Within the Asia-Pacific region, Australia faces a particular challenge with  respect to the secondary movement of asylum seekers - that is, people moving  irregularly from a place of initial protection to Australia in the hopes of having their  asylum claims assessed quickly in a more hospitable environment, and ultimately  attaining settlement in Australia. 

 1.9 The arrangement with Malaysia provides a real and substantial disincentive to  people, once they have reached a place of initial protection, from making the  dangerous onward journey by sea to Australia. As the Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship has explained: 

 …[S]ending people back to where they started the boat journey does work.  The best disincentive is for people considering that journey to know that it  is all for nought, that they will be out of pocket and that they will be risking  their lives, only to wind up back where they started, which is  overwhelmingly Malaysia.... 

 The deal negotiated with Malaysia provides a genuinely effective plan to  remove the product people-smugglers are selling - a ticket to Australia - by  virtually turning back the boats, but in a safe and orderly fashion... 

 The message that it sends is that if you take the boat journey to Australia  then you'll be returned by plane to Malaysia and be processed in the mix of  more than 90,000 others.3 

 1.10 The Department's submission to the inquiry also emphasised the deterrent  effect of the Malaysian Arrangement: 

 Early indications suggested that, prior to the decision of the High Court of  Australia on 31 August 2011, the prospect of the Arrangement and the  Arrangement itself had already acted in some part as a deterrent to irregular  movement. The second-lowest number of irregular maritime arrivals  (IMAs) since August 2009 was recorded in June 2011, the month following  the joint announcement of the proposed Arrangement by the Prime

 Ministers of Australia and Malaysia. This is assessed as reflecting concern  among people smugglers and a reluctance among potential IMAs to travel,  as a result of the game changing nature of the announcement. A return to  onshore processing would likely result in increased and sustained levels of  IMAs.4 

 1.11 Nauru, the Coalition's preferred location for offshore processing of asylum  seeker claims, has no such deterrent effect. People smugglers know that if asylum  seekers are sent to Nauru and are found to be refugees, they will be resettled in  Australia. As the Minister has observed: 

 The best advice and intelligence we have - which the government has  shared with Abbott - clearly shows that people-smugglers now know that if  asylum-seekers are sent to Nauru and are found to be refugees, they will be  resettled in Australia. That is not an effective deterrent.5 

 Protection for asylum seekers 

 1.12 The Joint Prime Ministerial Statement of 7 May 2011 clearly states that  Transferees to Malaysia will be treated with dignity and respect, and in accordance  with human rights standards. This commitment is also plainly expressed in clause 8(1)  of the Malaysian Arrangement.  

 1.13 In contrast to the Malaysian Arrangement, the Coalition has continued to  advocate a policy of towing back boats to Indonesia. The strategy to 'tow back the  boats' highlights the Coalition's policy incoherence - there has been absolutely no  indication of what, if any, protections Indonesia would extend to asylum seekers who  are towed back to that country. Despite this gaping hole in its policy, the Coalition  continues to insist that the groundbreaking protections negotiated for Transferees  under the Malaysian Arrangement are inadequate. 

 International law obligations 

 1.14 The majority report's dismissal of the commitments made by the  Malaysian Government to implement its human rights obligations under the  arrangement is disappointing. Specifically, the majority report has failed to recognise  the involvement that the UNHCR has had in the development of the arrangement.  

 1.15 The Malaysian Arrangement is consistent with the Australian Government's  obligations under the Refugee Convention, and other international treaties. As an  officer of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship explained to the committee: 

 Successive governments have taken the view that Australia will be acting  consistently with international law and accepted practice, so long as it is  satisfied that asylum seekers removed to another country will not be 

 

 4  Submission 31, p. 5.

 Page 52  

 

 refouled, and that they will be given an opportunity to have their status  determined in that country. The Malaysian Government has undertaken to  respect the principle of non-refoulement, and to permit transferees to  Malaysia to have their asylum claims assessed by UNHCR. 

 ... 

 In terms of any claim a potential transferee may have made against  Malaysia itself, this claim and any other non-refoulement obligations were  to be assessed in the pre-removal assessment of the individual's  circumstances...6 

 1.16 The Department also indicated that in relation to children, a 'best interests of  the child' assessment would also be undertaken in the preremoval assessment process,  thus meeting Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.7 

 1.17 The Department explained the following aspects of the arrangement, which  mean that Australia is complying with its international law obligations: 

 ï· Where a person is determined not to be a refugee, Australia will be given the 

 opportunity to undertake an assessment against other non-refoulement  obligations before the person is removed from Malaysia. 

 ï· With regards to article 31 (no penalty) of the Refugee Convention, nothing in  the convention prevents a different regime being in place for offshore entry  persons, providing the scheme does not involve the imposition of a penalty on  account of unauthorised entry. The Australian Government maintains that  offshore processing does not amount to a penalty within the terms of  article 31. In addition, article 31 applies to refugees coming directly from the  place of feared persecution, not to those involved in secondary movement. 

 ï· In relation to article 3 (non-discrimination), the discrimination referred to is  discrimination based on race, religion or country of origin. The different  treatment accorded to offshore entry persons has nothing to do with the race,  religion or country of origin of these persons.8 

 1.18 Further, Government Senators note the Department's clarification in relation  to protection obligations under the Refugee Convention: 

 Many commentators conflate the obligations that the refugee convention  sets out as owed to with those that are owed to asylum seekers. The  convention allocates rights or protections to refugees in categories based on  the type of immigration status a person has in the host state. The categories  include physical presence, lawful presence, lawful stay and residence. So,  for example, rights or protections concerning employment, housing and  social security are restricted to refugees lawfully staying in a state's territory

 not to asylum seekers whose claims have not been assessed and whose  status has not been regularised. 

 The arrangement with Malaysia also provides for decent standards of  treatment for transferees, with Malaysia undertaking to treat them with  dignity and respect and in accordance with human rights 

 standards...Australia does not accept that it has a legal obligation that  persons outside our territory have to be accorded with the same standards of  treatment in all respects as they would have received had they remained in  Australia. In the case of transfers to countries for processing outside  Australia, we have, however, accepted a moral obligation to ensure that  such people are accorded reasonable standards of treatment.9 

 1.19 Government Senators also acknowledge the following statement by the  Prime Minister, the Hon Julia Gillard MP: 

 [The Australian Government is] now in a position to say refugee  convention obligations—most important of all, the obligation of non-refoulement, of making sure that people are not returned to a place of  persecution—can be achieved in Malaysia. In addition to that we can see in  Malaysia the processing of claims and we can see people's humanitarian  needs dealt with.10 

 Commitments by Malaysia 

 1.20 The Malaysian Government has demonstrated a strong commitment to its  human rights obligations under the Malaysian Arrangement. As the Prime Minister  has explained: 

 [These] are the obligations that Malaysia has freely entered into in this  arrangement between us. The Malaysian government has done this freely.  The Malaysian government has done it freely because it stands ready to  implement it.11 

 1.21 The Malaysian Government's commitment to the arrangement was also  highlighted by an officer of the Department at the hearing: 

 ...[T]he fact that the Malaysian government was willing to sit down and  negotiate with us over a number of weeks, and there were practical  arrangements that they were actually putting in place to ensure that the  terms of the arrangement were going to be met, is an indication that they  had every intention of meeting the commitments that had been made in the

 arrangement. The fact that a minister of state also signed the arrangement  is...a strong commitment from the government.12 

 1.22 Government Senators are particularly concerned at the tone of hysteria  surrounding the majority report's discussion about caning in Malaysia. Since asylum  seekers transferred to Malaysia pursuant to the arrangement will not be illegal  migrants, they will be exempted under section 55 of the Malaysian Immigration Act.13  This means that Transferees under the arrangement will have entered Malaysia  legally, will not have committed any immigration offence under Malaysian domestic  law, and will not be subject to caning.  

 1.23 Further, Malaysia's commitment to treating asylum seekers transferred from  Australia in line with human rights standards clearly means that such persons will not  be caned. As the Department advised: 

 The Department is satisfied with the assurances provided by the Malaysian  government [with respect to caning]. The Arrangement was negotiated in  good faith and freely entered into by Malaysia. Malaysian Minister for  Home Affairs Hishammuddin has stated publicly that Malaysia would  ensure those protections outlined in the Arrangement were upheld.14 

 Involvement of UNHCR 

 1.24 Government Senators believe that the majority report fails to acknowledge the  role of the UNHCR in the negotiations towards, and implementation of, the Malaysian  Arrangement. The UNHCR has been closely consulted on the arrangement and its  associated Operational Guidelines, and provided constructive comments which helped  to shape the final wording of the arrangement.15 

 1.25 In its submission to the committee, the UNHCR indicated its support for the  Malaysian Arrangement, noting that it 'responds to the particular domestic and  regional context of the asylum and migration situation in the Asia-Pacific region'.16  Further: 

 ...UNHCR is appreciative of the efforts made by the two parties to provide  fundamental protection safeguards for transferees, notably: respect for the  principle of non-refoulement, the right to asylum, the principle of family  unity and best interests of the child, humane reception conditions, including  protection against arbitrary detention, and the realization of durable  solutions.17

 1.26 As the UNHCR informed the committee: 

 UNHCR was neither called upon, nor would it have been appropriate, to  'endorse' or otherwise formally sanction the Arrangements. There is nothing  unusual about this and no inference can reasonably be drawn from this.  Under Article 8 of its founding Statute UNHCR is mandated to promote  and advocate for measures that improve the situation for refugees which, in  this instance, it has steadfastly done through its advice to both parties.18 

 1.27 Government Senators acknowledge that the UNHCR's position 'is and remains  conditioned upon proper protection and vulnerability safeguards determining the pre-transfer/pre-removal assessment process in Australia'.19 The Australian Government  has put these protections in place through the procedures set out in the document 'Pre-removal Assessment Process for Transfers to a Third Country'.20 

 1.28 Government Senators also note that under the Arrangement, the Australian  Government will provide funding to the UNHCR to undertake a range of support  activities. This funding will assist asylum seekers and refugees more generally in  Malaysia while they are processed and await a durable solution. Some of the activities  that will be funded include community capacity building, enhancement of UNHCR  identity cards, and improvements to basic health care and emergency health support.21 

 1.29 The committee heard from many submitters with strong opinions on, but no  direct involvement with, the Malaysian Arrangement. The UNHCR has direct  involvement with, and knowledge of, the arrangement and is, in the view of  Government Senators, best able to offer a considered and expert opinion. In contrast,  the Commonwealth and Immigration Ombudsman conceded that his office does 'not  purport to have any knowledge of administration in Malaysia' and 'no specific  technical or legal knowledge of procedures in Malaysia'.22 Further, the Ombudsman's  initial submission to the inquiry contained substantial errors of fact, which he was  subsequently required to correct.23 Given that the Ombudsman's role includes  oversight of immigration detention and refugee assessment, such errors are simply  unacceptable. Government Senators suggest that, in future, the Ombudsman ensure his  information is correct before making comments such as these on the public record.

 Proposed amendments to the Migration Act 

 1.30 In conclusion, Government Senators note the importance of ensuring that the  Migration Legislation Amendment (Offshore Processing and Other Measures) Bill  2011 passes the Parliament as a matter of urgency, in order to facilitate the  implementation of the Malaysian Arrangement. In that context, Government Senators  point out that the Coalition's proposed amendment to the Bill to allow transfers of  asylum seekers to Refugee Convention countries only would have precluded any  transfers to Nauru, if moved in 2001.

 ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BY  SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  Background 

 1.1 On 7 May 2011, the Minister for Immigration announced that the Australian  Government had reached an asylum seeker deal with Malaysia.  Despite not being a  signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees, the  Government maintained that it was satisfied that the rights of the 800 asylum seekers  exported to Malaysia would be upheld.  

 1.2 Aside from the Australian Greens being fundamentally opposed to any  agreement that would see Australia shirking its international obligations, this deal was  struck with a country that is not even a signatory to the Refugee Convention, could not  guarantee the human rights of any asylum seeker sent there, and dramatically  undermined genuine attempts to establish a true regional protection framework.   

 1.3 From all the evidence provided to this inquiry, and from the key experts and  stakeholders in the community, this deal does nothing to address the real problems  facing asylum seekers throughout our region, rather it punishes the vulnerable men,  women and children who have fled desperate circumstances seeking our protection.   

 1.4 More than 15 Australian refugee groups recently issued a joint statement  condemning federal political leaders for arguing asylum seeker policy was a choice  between reopening Nauru or a new detention centre in Malaysia. These groups, like  the Australian Greens, condemn that policy, arguing neither is acceptable. The groups  also said: "The question Australian and international policy makers should focus on is  not how to stop the boats but how refugees in Asia-Pacific can receive effective  protection."1 

 1.5 Despite the High Court ruling that the Malaysia deal was unlawful, on  12 September 2011, the Prime Minister, and Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship, the Hon. Chris Bowen MP, announced their intention to circumvent the  High Court's ruling, and introduce legislative amendments to allow offshore  processing of asylum seekers.    

 Key concerns with the agreement 

 Cannot guarantee rights 

 1.6 In order to lawfully transfer asylum seekers to another country, Australia must  ensure that its obligations under the Refugee Convention will be fulfilled in that  country.  Given Malaysia is not a party to the Refugee Convention, nor has it 

 

 1  http://www.refugeecouncil.org.au/resources/statements/110606_JS_Nauru_Malaysia.pdf. 

 Page 58  

 

 indicated its willingness to sign; it does not contain any provisions in domestic law for  the protection of refugees.  A non-legally binding document, based on good faith, is  not sufficient, when the transfer country in question, has an appalling human rights  record when dealing with the more than 90,000 asylum seekers and refugees currently  awaiting assessment and resettlement. 

 1.7 The fact that this agreement would also include children, unaccompanied  minors (to whom the Minister for Immigration has a legal responsibility), and  pregnant women, gives cause to further concern about the ability to guarantee the  rights of anyone transferred to Malaysia. 

 Undermines Australia's international obligations 

 1.8 Under international law, all asylum seekers who arrive in Australia,  regardless of mode of arrival, must have their claims for protection assessed and if  found to be genuine refugees, offered protection. This deal effectively undermines the  fundamental human right to seek asylum. 

 1.9 Malaysia is not a signatory to the United Nations (UN) Refugee Convention  or Protocol, nor is it party to many other human rights treaties, including the  Convention Against Torture. In a submission to the inquiry, the Australian Refugee  Law Academics argued that, "as a matter of international law, in order to rely on  another country's refugee protection mechanisms, that country must respect the rights  of refugees and asylum seekers in practice."2 

 Undermines genuine leadership towards a regional protection framework 

 1.10 While the Government has claimed this agreement is part of the broader  regional framework to deal with asylum seekers, this deal does nothing of the sort. 

 1.11 This deal is nothing more than a political quick fix driven by domestic  considerations, rather than a genuine commitment working collaboratively within the  region. While no one wants to see asylum seekers risk their lives on the treacherous  seas in the hope of reaching Australian shores, simply punishing these vulnerable  people, without offering a true solution, has shown that the Government is not  interested in putting in the hard yards to work towards a long-term sustainable  protection framework. 

 1.12 This policy will not stem the boats. Asylum seekers will continue to make  dangerous journeys because they are desperate.  A political quick fix will not make  the issue go away. 

 1.13 Instead of looking for quick-fix 'solutions', what the Government should be  doing is increasing the humanitarian intake, with a targeted resettlement from within  our immediate region.

 Recommendation 1 

 1.14 The Australian Greens recommend that the deal with Malaysia, and any  other third country, should be rejected. 

 Recommendation 2 

 1.15 The Australian Greens recommend that the Government heed the advice  of the High Court, and return to onshore processing of asylum seekers' claims,  which is simpler, cheaper, more humane and supported by the Australian public. 

 Recommendation 3 

 1.16 The Australian Greens recommend that any attempt to amend the  Migration Act to circumvent the High Court's ruling that found the Minister's  declaration of Malaysia under section 198A of the Migration Act to be invalid,  should be rejected. 

 Recommendation 4 

 1.17 The Australian Greens recommend that the Australian Government  honour the commitment to resettle an additional 4,000 UNHCR-assessed  refugees directly from Malaysia. 

 Recommendation 5 

 1.18 The Australian Greens recommend that the humanitarian intake is  increased from 14,750 to between 20,000 and 25,000 with a targeted resettlement  from Australia's immediate region, including Malaysia and Indonesia.
