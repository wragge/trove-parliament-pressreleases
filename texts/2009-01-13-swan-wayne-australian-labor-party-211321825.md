 NATIONAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL GRANTS 

 Today I announce National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) grants totalling  over $48 million.   

 These funds will continue to support the next generation of health and medical researchers,  through Postdoctoral Training Fellowships, Postgraduate Scholarship Awards and the  NHMRC-European Union Collaborative Health Research Grants Scheme.   

 The recipients of these awards are the future of health and medical research in Australia.    

 Australian researchers have been responsible for significant advances and discoveries in the  fields of health and medical research and these awards encourage the next generation to  continue on their quest to improve the health and well being of people around the world. 

 

 NHMRC Postdoctoral Training Fellowships   

 The Rudd Government will provide total funding of $36.9 million for 132 NHMRC  Postdoctoral Training Fellowships.

 NHMRC-European Union Collaborative Health Research Grants Scheme   

 The Rudd Government has awarded grants totalling over $1.5 million to two Australian  researchers under the NHMRC-European Union Collaborative Health Research Grants  Scheme:   

 â¢  Professor Graham Giles, from the Cancer Council of Victoria, will receive $996,294  over five years to research the genetic variants that underlie susceptibility to  prostate, breast and ovarian cancers, and assess the genetic and environmental  factors involved; and  â¢  Professor Malcolm Sim, from Monash University, will receive $693,550 over five 

 years to investigate the risk of brain cancer from mobile phone use during  childhood and adolescence.   

 The NHMRC-European Union Collaborative Health Research Grants Scheme supports  Australian participation in international research projects.    

 It enables Australian researchers to strengthen their individual efforts and collaborate with  European and other international pioneering health and medical researchers.    

 This is a strategic investment to ensure that Australian health research remains at the  forefront of international advances, particularly in the prevention and treatment of cancer.
