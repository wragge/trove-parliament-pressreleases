 DECISION MAKING TO PROCEED ON EAST TIMORESE ASYLUM CLAIMS

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said  today  that  East  Timorese  asylum  seekers  in  Australia  would  be  invited  to provide  additional  information  in  support  of  their  claims,  so  that  decision  making could proceed.

 “Decision  making  on  protection  visa  applications  lodged  by  East  Timorese  asylum seekers had been delayed for several years because of litigation,” Mr Ruddock said.

 “More recently, there was a need to ensure that the situation in East Timor was clear enough  and  our  information  sufficiently  sound  to  enable  us  to  finalise  these  cases reliably.

 “Deciding these applications will allow these people to move on with their lives,” Mr Ruddock said.

 There  are several hundred applications from  East  Timorese  asylum  seekers  before the Department, covering approximately 1,700 people.

 These  applications  will  be  considered  on  a  case  by  case  basis  in  accordance  with standard protection visa processing arrangements.

 "In  view  of  the  passage  of  time  and  the  changed  conditions  in  East  Timor,  all applicants will have the opportunity to provide further information in support of their applications before any decision is made," Mr Ruddock said.

 “Anyone found to be owed refugee protection will, of course, receive it.

 “However, it is reasonable to expect people who are found not be refugees and so do not  have  a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution,  to  return  home  when  their  country  is safe and secure,” Mr Ruddock said.

 East  Timorese  people  who  have  applications  under  consideration  will  be  able  to remain in Australia until their applications are finally determined.

 The  Department  will  be  writing  to  all  East  Timorese  applicants  and  their representatives  to  provide  advice  on  how  their  applications  will  be  handled  and  to advise that existing arrangements for provision of Asylum Seeker Assistance to those in need will continue.
