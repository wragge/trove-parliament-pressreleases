  Government Hypocrisy On UN Committee Decision 

  The attempt by Immigration Minister, Philip Ruddock, to blame Labor for the UN Committee  decision which found Australia in breach of international covenants is utmost hypocrisy. 

  "Although attributing blame is not the key issue, Mr Ruddock's attack on forn1er Labor  governments compels a response," Shadow Minister for Immigration, Duncan Kerr said. 

  Speaking in PruÂ·liament about the law which the UN has criticised, Mr Ruddock had this to  say: 

  "The Migration Amendment Bill (No, 4) 1992, the passage of which is being  facilitated by the Opposition, is an important piece of legislation ..... ... This legislation  has the co-operation of the Opposition ... " Hansard 16 December 1992 

  And in a press conference on 2 March 1994, Mr Ruddock said : 

  " .... . we looked at every one of these covenants and the International treaties because  we didn't want to be in the situation in which Australia was at breach and we don't  accept that there's a breach of any of these covenants." 

  "The Govemment, however, now has to look closely at the implications of the decision by the  UN Committee, particularly as it affects its proposals which would further restrict rights of  persons in detention or claiming refugee or humanitarian status. 

  "The two proposals that may need to be reviewed are: th e an nouncement by the Minister for  Immigration, Mr Ruddock, that the Government wi ll introduce a privati ve clause to the  Migration Act which will limit appeals to the Courts, and the announcement by the Attomey  General which implied that in the fu ture Legal Aid may not be available to persons claiming  refugee status," Mr Kerr said.
