 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE NOVEMBER 11, 2003  

 

 RANZCP AIRS DEEP CONCERN AT THE MANDATORY  DETENTION OF CHILD ASYLUM SEEKERS   

 A study of children detained in Australia as asylum seekers has found that 80% had attempted  to harm themselves.   

 It also found that all the children met the diagnostic criteria for major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.    

 These findings are to be released in Sydney tomorrow at the national summit on health of  asylum seekers organised by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists  (RANZCP), representatives of all medical colleges and major health and mental health  groups.   

 The study by Dr Sarah Mares and Dr Jon Jureidini of 20 children aged from under five to 17  found that more than half the children also had an anxiety disorder.   

 Ten children aged five and under had delayed or compromised social and cognitive  development symptoms consistent with environmental deprivation and three fulfilled the  criteria for attachment disorders or severe parent/child relationship problems.   

 These children had all been exposed to violence and had witnessed adults cutting, hanging or  poisoning themselves.   

 All had at least one parent with a severe psychiatric illness.   

 A RANZCP spokesperson, Dr Louise Newman, said she was deeply concerned about the  mental health of children detained as asylum seekers.   

 She said the combination of pre- migration trauma, the detention environment and parental  depression was “damaging” the children.   

 Dr Newman, who is the chair of the Faculty of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of the  RANZCP, said the psychological damage was severe and was likely to have long-term  consequences.   

 The RANZCP says there are major weaknesses in Australia’s current policies relating to the 

 mandatory detention of child asylum seekers and has issued a position statement detailing  opposition to the prolonged detention of children under the policy of mandatory detention.   

 The RANZCP advocates that the issue must be addressed with regard to the emotional  development of detained children - many of whom had been born in detention - and the  effects of detention on the functioning of their families.  All asylum seekers, both those  detained and those granted temporary release into the community, should be given full access  to mental health services.   

 More research was also needed into the mental health of asylum seekers and their mental  health needs.
