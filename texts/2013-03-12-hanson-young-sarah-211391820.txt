 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Tuesday, 12 March 2013   

 Opposition fails to reject vilification of  refugees   

 The Greens were disappointed to see the Opposition vote against a motion rejecting the  vilification of refugees and asylum seekers in the Senate today.   

 “The debate around immigration has become so toxic in recent weeks that the parliament can’t  even unify in condemning vilification of refugees,” the Greens immigration spokesperson,  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “While it was encouraging to see the motion pass, with support from the government, it was  both surprising and disappointing to see the Coalition vote against it.   

 “The parliament needs to reflect the best aspects of Australian society and it is sad to see that  things have come to this, with the chamber not even able to agree that that vilification of  refugees deserves to be rejected.   

 “This was an opportunity for the Liberal Party to stop the dog whistling, to stand up to the  elements of society that thinks it is OK to demonise and vilify vulnerable people, but it is an  opportunity they have chosen to ignore.   

 “At least there was enough common sense remaining in the Senate to pass this motion, but it is  concerning to see how far the Opposition is willing to sink when it comes to scoring political  points.”   

 

 The motion as moved by Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, which was supported by the Labor Party  and opposed by the Coalition, is below;   

 ‘I move that the Senate rejects the vilification of refugees and asylum seekers.’
