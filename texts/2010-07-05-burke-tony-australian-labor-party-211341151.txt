 The Hon. Tony Burke MP  

 Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry  

 Minister for Sustainable Population 

 doorstop Windsor Park Multi-purpose Community, Leisure and Wellbeing  Centre 

 15 July 2010  DAFF10/223T 

 REPORTER: Can you tell us when a federal election might be held? 

 TONY BURKE: That’s a question you would have to direct to the Prime Minister, that’s not  information I brought with me today. 

 REPORTER: Can you tell us how important the role of forestry might play in the federal election? 

 TONY BURKE: I hope that we end up with the situation where there is strong bipartisan support,  across both sides of politics. What forestry needs has always been to move beyond the day to day  political cycle and get into a long term investment cycle. That’s the best thing for forestry. I don’t  think anyone in forestry benefits from people wanting to play political games with the lives on  timber communities. 

 REPORTER: Are you talking to people from forestry today, while you’re here? Are you making any  moves there? 

 TONY BURKE: I’ve had a meeting with some of the private forest owners today. Every time I  come to Tasmania I catch up with people from forestry. I would like to stress comments I made  this morning though, I am not in a negotiation with the forest industry. Forest industry is currently  talking amongst themselves, working out what sort of pathway they need to move forward  because obviously there have been changes in the international woodchip market, there’s some  challenges that they have. They’ve got to work out what they think is best for industry and when  they do they’ll bring that to Government. 

 REPORTER: So the report in The Age was incorrect on Tuesday? That you brokered the  negotiations. 

 TONY BURKE:  I have not been at the negotiating table, there are negotiation and discussions  within industry. Some industry groups have also chosen to involve some of the environmental  organisations in those discussions. I am listening and am all ears but I am certainly not at the  negotiating table. 

 REPORTER: So, do you know how the negotiations are proceeding? Are you hopeful that there will  be an outcome within a short period or do you think it is a longer timeframe? 

 TONY BURKE: I don’t think anyone knows the answer to that question. If consensus can be  reached it would be a great thing. The history of forestry issues in Tasmania for generations has  been that that consensus hasn’t been available. If it is available, then I hope either side of politics  would have a look at whatever proposals come forward but it’s for the stakeholders here in  Tasmania to work those issues out. 

 REPORTER: Can I ask you a wee bit about Mr Harkins Tasmanian solution for asylum seekers,  does that have any credibility as far as you’re concerned as the Sustainable Population Minister. 

 TONY BURKE: Julia Gillard and Chris Evans have made clear the priorities for establishing a  regional processing centre. The talks that are going on internationally have been well publicised  and there’s nothing really that I can add to that. 

 REPORTER: So, you don’t know about Mr Harkins suggestion that Tasmania could be used as an  offshore or a local solution to that, having housed refugees from Albania? 

 TONY BURKE: The proposals that we’re dealing with internationally are proposals that Julia  Gillard has enunciated, I think she has enunciated them very clearly.
