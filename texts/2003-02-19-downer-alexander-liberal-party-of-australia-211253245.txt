 Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer 

 Doorstop Interview

 Downer: The United Nations has asked for contributions to a United Nations contingency fund  for humanitarian relief for Iraq, in an environment where the crisis is over.  And we have  today announced that we’ll provide $10 million for the contingency fund.  However this crisis  is resolved, whether it’s resolved peacefully or whether it’s resolved militarily, once these  sanctions against Iraq are lifted, in those circumstances there will be a considerable need for  reconstruction and humanitarian relief.  And we think it’s appropriate that Australia  contributes to that.  The people of Iraq have been in a living hell for the last thirty years.  The  country has been in either a direct state or a virtual state of war throughout the period of  Saddam Hussein’s rule.  Life has not been normal for the Iraqi people.  They have had a  simply appalling time, I think, once this crisis with Iraq is resolved, however it’s resolved, and  we don’t know how that will happen, of course, but once it is resolved and sanctions are lifted,  there will be a real opportunity for the Iraqi people to live in freedom.  To be able to build  proper lives, to have a normal existence right away from a military or semi-military  environment.  And we really do want to contribute to that better life for the Iraqi people.  So  we’ve responded generously to the Secretary General of the United Nations’ request for  contributions to this contingency fund.  Quite a lot of countries have done the same thing.   We’re happy to do that.

 Journalist: What will the money be used for?

 Downer: It’ll be used for humanitarian relief of different kinds.  Some of it no doubt will be  used for reconstruction of some of the essential services which in Iraq are extremely  degraded, extremely run down.  There’s been very little maintenance on a lot of the essential  services now for quite some years.  Some of it will be used to ensure more effective forms of  food distribution.  And there are substantial problems of malnutrition in Iraq, for example  because of the way the Iraqi Government has managed food distribution and of course the  priorities it’s given to humanitarian people for its people as compared to military build-up.  So  it will be used for those sorts of things.  Some of it, that’s $2 million of the $10 million, is  going to the International Committee of the Red Cross.

 Journalist: The UNHCR says that 600,000 refugees will leave Iraq if there is war  immediately.  Is Australia going to take any of those refugees?

 Downer: Well we don’t know the answer to whether there’ll be a war or not.  And we don’t  know the answer to whether there’ll be refugees or not if there’s a war, or even if there isn’t a  war.  I think that it’s possible you could get refugee flows, particularly if there were military  action in some parts of Iraq, though hard to know really.  Some people say some of the Kurds  will flee across the border in the event of there being military action, I’m not sure.  But we’ll  obviously make a contribution to helping people in those circumstances.  Of course we will.

 Journalist: Do you think it would increase our humanitarian refugee intake, and of what size?

 Downer: Well it’s impossible to say really what the situation would be, so it’s a hard question  to answer.  But if there was a grave international demand to do that, we would be prepared to  play a part as the Prime Minister has said already.  I’m not sure that you’re likely to get a  situation which is quite as black and white as that.  I think what is more likely is, in a situation  where there were military conflict, there may be some people, particularly from the ethnic  minorities, who would move across the border for fear that there might be some acts of  retribution or whatever from Saddam Hussein, which of course happened after 1991.  And in  those circumstances if there military action and the regime was toppled very quickly, those  people would probably just move back to their homes, so there probably wouldn’t be any need  for resettlement of refugees in those circumstances.  That’s probably a more likely scenario.   But if there was a need for the resettlement of the refugees, of course we would play a part.

 Journalist: The Age reported today that the US has set a new resolution which sets a  deadline of 2-3 weeks and that the Australian Cabinet has agreed to support and lobby for  that.  Is that correct?

 Downer: No.  That isn’t actually correct.  The Australian Cabinet didn’t discuss that at all.   And secondly it’s hardly surprising because the Americans haven’t done that either.  We’re  certainly of the view that Saddam Hussein is in material breach of Security Council resolution  1441.  I don’t think there’s too much argument around the world with that proposition.   Secondly, 1441 was supposed to be a last chance for Saddam Hussein, but there is a view,  and I think this is widely held in Australia as well as elsewhere, that we should go down the  path of a further Security Council resolution.  And if that’s to take place, and a lot of  consideration is being given to that in capitals, not just in New York, if that is to take place  then that’s probably going to happen in the next few weeks.  But we certainly haven’t taken  the view that there should be any particular timeline, except that in the end, you just can’t  have Security Council resolution 1441 flouted forever.  It’s perfectly clear Saddam has not  fully cooperated with the UN inspectors and is not complying fully with Security Council  resolution 1441.  So, what is the last single piece of pressure the Security Council can apply?   It is one more resolution.

 Journalist: How much longer do you think the UN can hold out before (inaudible)?

 Downer: Well I think the UN needs to be seized with and engaged with this issue  continuously.  I don’t think the UN should just withdraw from the process.  The UN has passed  its resolutions.  It now needs to make sure that its resolutions are implemented.  There’s no  point in the UN getting into some sort of cat and mouse game with Saddam Hussein as the UN  was involved in the 1990’s with a game like that.  In the end the predecessor to UNMOVIC,  UNSCOM collapsed as an organisation because Saddam Hussein played a very successful cat  and mouse game with them.  He has form.  We know what his tactics are.  We know he’s  trying to get away with a cat and mouse game again.  A few concessions here, a few there,  but not too much, little bit of cooperation, but not too much cooperation.  We’ve seen it all  before.  We’ve seen it all before.  We’re not naÃ¯ve, we’ve seen it all before and this time  Saddam Hussein is going to be disarmed and the United Nations Security Council resolutions  are going to be implemented and we urge the Security Council to uphold its own authority.

 Journalist: Just on the subject of North Korea, you’ve said today that it’s too early to talk  about sanctions there.  But with Japan and South Korea talking about developing their own  nuclear weapons, how can you say that?

 Downer: Let’s get this clear.  Japan and South Korea are not announcing that they’re  beginning a program of developing nuclear weapons.  All they are doing is discussing a  hypothetical.  Now the real point here is that North Korea, by saying that it’s getting back into  the nuclear weapons game, is being profoundly threatening to its neighbours.  I mean it’s all  very well for them to denounce the United States and so on, but the people who are  understandably most nervous about a nuclear armed North Korea are North Korea’s  neighbours, obviously South Korea and that is the one country that North Korea has invaded  in the last 50 years.  Japan, and they have the experience of a North Korean missile overflying  Japan and landing in the sea the other side of Japan, a few years ago.  The other country that  I think is already a nuclear weapons state that’s very concerned about a nuclear armed North  Korea is China.  So all of these countries feel very nervous about this situation and what the  North Koreans have done is escalate tension on the Korean Peninsular and in North-East Asia  very substantially.  And in the end it will get them nowhere.  There’s no game for North Korea  playing the nuclear card - it really isn’t going to work for North Korea.

 Journalist: So you think it’s just bluff and bluster?

 Downer: Well what the North Koreans are saying - I mean a lot of what they’re saying is  bluff and bluster, but the serious point, you’ve got to separate bluff and bluster from  substance.  And the point of substance is that they are going ahead now with their nuclear  program and that is profoundly disturbing.  Now we say that in the end there’ll have to be  some bilateral dialogue between North Korea and the United States.  But this is an issue not  just of American and North Korean concern, but of international concern, including Australian  concern.  It has now been referred by the Board of Governors of the IAEA, which we’re one, to  the Security Council.  We don’t think it is timely for the Security Council to impose sanctions  on North Korea.  We think that the Security Council should be seized of the issue and express  appropriate concern about it, but there needs to be time given for the negotiating process.   Because after all this is a crisis which re-erupted in October of last year, so there needs to be  time for the negotiating process.

 Journalist: Can I just ask you about the Australian Democrats, they’re holding a plebiscite  today in six polling booths across New South Wales.  What’s your comment about their effort  to take that message to the Prime Minister in their own way?

 Downer: Look I’m not a great subscriber to opinion polls, but when I looked at opinion polls  over recent weeks, I’ve seen the Australian Democrats sitting on twp per cent rather  constantly.  My sense is that they might be, excuse me if I’m just a little cynical, but it’s  possible the Australian Democrats could be embarking on a bit of a stunt here in order to get  publicity.  Some may say I’m wrong, but I’d bet a lot of money on this just being a little stunt  to give the Democrats a bit of publicity.

 Journalist: An Adelaide mother is leaving today for Iraq to be part of a human shield.  Do  you support that sort of action by any Australian citizen?

 Downer: No I do not.  I think she’s very unwise for two reasons.  In the first place, obviously  she shouldn’t put her safety at risk.  And whatever she thinks about her own welfare she does  have a family and friends, people who care about her in Australia.  And they don’t want to, no  Australian wants to see her come to harm.  The second thing is that she shouldn’t give  comfort to Saddam Hussein.  This is a barbaric regime. She’s making a very big mistake if she  thinks that the people of Iraq are 100 per cent behind their barbaric dictator.  Don’t  underestimate the people of Iraq.  Actually they don’t like being the subjects of a brutal  dictator.  These are people who want to be freed from dictatorship and freed from 

 oppression.  These aren’t people who enjoy being subjected to the whims of a bloodthirsty  dictator.  The 22 or so million people of Iraq have been living in an appalling environment for  the last thirty years.  To be honest with you, they want a new life.  They want a freer life;  they want a more prosperous life.  And a lot of Westerners going in there and being human  shields and son, as publicity stunts, they’re not on the side of the ordinary Iraqi who wants to  get rid of Saddam Hussein.  And I think these sorts of protestors and publicity seekers and  other groups of people need to spare a thought for the ordinary people of Iraq who have been  subjected to a living hell for the last thirty years.  Give them a   chance.  Try to take the side  of those who are opposed to Saddam Hussein.

 Journalist: (inaudible) an orphanage…

 Downer: I don’t think orphanages are going to be a military target.

 Journalist: I dare say she wouldn’t disagree with all of those sentiments about the barbarism  …

 Downer: That I don’t know.

 Journalist: Is there not a case though that perhaps aggression isn’t necessarily the best way  of resolving it?

 Downer: No the best way of resolving it is peacefully if that can be done.  But what happens  if that can’t be done?  If you can’t do that, is the best way of resolving it just giving up and  walking away, and letting a brutal dictator just continue not only to develop his chemical and  biological weapons, even nuclear weapons, to brutalise his own people?  That would be  something, if I may say so, that would weigh on conscience a little bit.  Oh well, you know in  the end it wasn’t really possible to do anything about it, there were some demonstrators and  son on, and I decided that I’d just back down and do nothing more about it, and yes I would  see the consequences - the brutality of Saddam Hussein just continuing endlessly, the  suffering of the people of Iraq endlessly going forward into the future, no relief for them, no  freedom, no liberation for the people of Iraq, I didn’t do anything about it  cause I was  worried about a few protesters - no I don’t think that’s a good way to go.

 Journalist: Minister, you’ve met with your Indonesian colleague I Gede Ardika, and you’ve  discussed the war in Iraq and whether there’d be a backlash against Westerners.  How stable  do you actually think Indonesia is at the moment?  There some like Helen Clark now saying it  could promote terrorism if there is actually bloodshed in Iraq.

 Downer: A couple of answers to that.  First of all terrorism is with us.  And 88 Australians  were killed in Bali on October the 12th and I think now the latest figure is over 200 people  they estimate were killed in the Bali bombing.  Terrorism is there.  It’s not something that  might happen if something is done.  Terrorism is there - we’re got to deal with that.  And  we’re working quite successfully with the Indonesians, ever more successfully with the  Indonesians in addressing the issue of terrorism.  Look I think if in the end the world is left  with a choice of either forcibly disarming Saddam Hussein, or doing nothing, that’s a tough  call for the world, but I suppose in the end people will say, well we better forcibly disarm him  and do it as quickly as possible and as effectively as possible.  And there will be some  demonstrators against that in Indonesia, and in Malaysia and in a number of Muslim  countries.  I accept that.  But I think if it comes to that, we can weather those  demonstrations.

 Journalist: So how stable though do you think Indonesia is?

 Downer: I think it’s stable.  I don’t think Indonesia is on the threshold of collapse, most  certainly not.  Indonesia is stable enough.  It’s not terribly stable, there are problems in Aceh  and Papua and so on, but it’s reasonably stable.

 Journalist: And what about Bali?  The travel warning’s still in place?

 Downer: Yes. We’re keeping the travel warning in place.  I met with the Indonesian Tourism  Minister yesterday and the Deputy-Governor of Bali and they asked me to have another look  at the travel advisory.  I’ve said to them that I would get further advice from our intelligence  agencies and others and look at the travel advisory.  But I haven’t had any information so far  that has led me to judge that it should be changed.
