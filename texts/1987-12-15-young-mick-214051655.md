 The Minister for Immigration ,  Local Government and Ethnic -------- -— .-Affairs,  |Mick Young/,  and the Minister for Employment Services   and Youth Affairs, [Clyde Holding> .  today announced the   composition of an Advisory Council and details of funding for  

 the National Policy on Languages.

 The Ministers said $15.1 million had been allocated in the   current budget for the National Policy on Languages and it   would receive $28 million in 1988-89. '

 They said the Council which would advise on languages policy   would be broadly representative of groups with an interest in _   tne area. It would oversee the implementation of the policy ^   and assess its effectiveness.

 The Advisory Council would be cnaired by Mr Joseph Lo Bianco,   author of tne report "National Policy on Languages1 '. .

 "The policy package reflects the Government's determination'to :   ensure that our education and training systems respond more . actively to the major economic and social challenges now facing   Australia,  " the Ministers said.

 "It also addresses the needs and aspirations of the   educationally disadvantaged as well as fostering the enr.chment   ~ “o ^ “Australian cultural and intellectual life." .....  ......

 The policy would : have six major elements, all of which w Duld be   in place by the start of the 1988 academic year: "  '

 English as a Second Language - $5.7m ha:; been allocated :o   supplement tne existing ESL program for newly-arrived refugee. -   and migrant children in 1987/88 .  Newly -arrived refugee and   migrant children are amongst the most disadvantaged stud ants  

 and this program underlines the Commonwealth 's commitmen: to   meeting their needs .  _ ·  J

'  1987-88) . This program will be expanded in 1988-89 with a â   budget of $ 7 .5m and this will give greater stimulus to the 

 improvement and extension of second language learning in  Australian schools. .

 Adult Literacy Action Campaign - a campaign to improve levels  of adult literacy ($1.96m in 1987-88). Many adult Australians  have poor English reading-and-writing skills^ The campaign — will coincide"with'Aus tr alia rs Bicentennial and will "boos t- 

 significantly adult literacy in English.

 Asian Studies - a range of initiatives designed to boost the  study of Asian languages and cultures ($1.85m in 1987-88).

 Multicultural and Cross-Cultural Supplementation Programs - to  boost multicultural and inter-cultural studies m  tertiary  education institutions, particularly for the development of -  cross-cultural training within professional courses ($0.75m in 

 1987-88). ·

 National Aboriginal Languages Project - initiatives in  Aboriginal languages, including bilingual education, language  maintenance and language awareness programs ($0.5m in 1987-88)

 Mr Young and Mr Holding said the policy would make a major  contribution towards lifting language skills in the workforce  and this was a necessary step in the restructuring of the ·  Australian economy.

 "It will do this by enhancing the level of English language  competence amongst Australians of non-English speaking  background; the level of English literacy for all Australians;  and by providing greater opportunities for the study of the 

 languages of our major trading partners.  ~

 "At the same time, it will encourage the maintenance of our  rich linguistic heritage. .

 "The policy is flexible enough to take account of the  requirements and priorities of State, Territory and  non-government education systems."
