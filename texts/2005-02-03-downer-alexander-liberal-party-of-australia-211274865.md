 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  HON ALEXANDER DOWNER, MP   

 

 TRANSCRIPTION: PROOF COPY E & OE   

 

 DATE: February 3 2005 

 

 TITLE:   Joint Press Conference with Luxembourg Foregin Minister, Mr Jean Asselborn   LUXEMBOURG   

 

 

 

 

 Mr Asselborn: I can think we can go on immediately.  We had a very wide-ranging meeting  and an interesting exchange of views.  It’s always positive to see that, despite the distance  which separate us, and the very different geographical situations, we always share very  similar views.  Our discussions today considered the changes and challenges in our respective  regions.   

 The EU presented the priorities of the Presidency including external relations as well as the  internal EU issues, such as the Lisbon strategy, the financial perspective and the new  Constitution.  It gave an overview of recent developments such as the forthcoming  membership of Bulgaria and Romania in January 2007, the European Council’s decision on  the beginning of accession negotiations with Turkey and the start of accession negotiations  with Croatia in March.   

 We had an exchange of views with our Australian colleague on the situation in Asia after the  tsunami in the Indian Ocean and we discussed the actions already taken and which we will  take in the future in response to this catastrophic type of situation.  As you know, the next  steps for the EU are set out the Action Plan agreed last Monday in Brussels by the Council.   

 On international issues, we discussed, above all, the situation on the Korean peninsula which  is of course preoccupying both of us.  Mr Downer spoke of the insight into the Australian  reading of the developments in north-east Asia.  China and EU relations were also discussed  in this respect.  This is an important point for China, the EU and for Australia.   

 Furthermore, we had an exchange of views on the elections in Iraq.  We both commended the  courage and determination of the Iraqi people in taking part in the elections despite the  difficult security situation. The elections are an important and successful stage in the process  of democratic transition in Iraq, it represents the first step taken by the Iraqi people on the  road to democracy, freedom and peace, which will continue.

 The EU also thought it important to inform our Australian colleagues about the new EU  efforts to find a diplomatic solution concerning the Iran nuclear program.  Last night,  President Bush said that he will take the initiative that if the EU and the United States will  cooperate on this issue, it will be much easier for us and also for the Americans.  It was very  interesting to hear Australia’s views on the situation in the Pacific region, as stability and the  sustainable development in the Pacific are also EU objectives.  As far as counter-terrorism is  concerned, our very important enumerations with third countries, to which the EU attaches  the utmost importance to cooperation with Australia in the fight against terrorism.  We paid  very special attention to Australia’s role in the region and its own neighbourhood policies.   Let me conclude by saying that we had very interesting talks with our Australian colleagues  and aim to enhance our good cooperation in all fields.  Thank you.   

 Mr Downer: Thank you Jean, I’d just like to say what a great pleasure it’s been for me in  coming to Luxembourg  today, I’ve been to Luxembourg on many occasions before when I  used to work in Brussels and work in the Australian Mission to the European Union, we were  accredited to Luxembourg and I used to have quite a lot of friends here, so it’s good to be  back.   

 I think we had a very successful discussion today with the Luxembourg Presidency and also  with the Commission and we have concentrated on all the issues that Jean Asselborn has  articulated.  I won’t go through all of those except to make two points.   

 The first is that we know that there have been divisions over this issue of Iraq, and we joined  with America and Britain in the “coalition of the willing” to get rid of Saddam Hussein.   Other countries chose not to.  Some countries opposed the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, but  that’s all history.  We’ve got to work for the future now; we’ve got to find ways to work  together in the civilised world to ensure that the democracy that we saw beginning to flourish  last weekend can consolidate and the people of Iraq can truly have their freedom.  I’m very  heartened by the positive messages that have come today from the EU Presidency and the  Commission, and yesterday from the NATO Secretary-General and other officials.  I think we  all understand now we need to train up the Iraqi security forces, we need to make sure they  can do the job of security and we don’t have to stay there any longer than is necessary; and  that the Sunni and Shi’ia and Kurdish people need to work through ways of living and  working together - not through tyranny but in the spirit of freedom and democracy.  I’ve been  very heartened during this visit to Europe how the atmosphere on this issue has changed so  much and I think everybody feels we can put the differences behind us and move on for the  best.   

 The only other thing I would want to touch on is the economic front, the work that we’ve got  to do to make the Doha Round a successful round of trade negotiations to ensure that  agricultural export subsidies are eliminated and that there is better access into the markets of  the rich world for the farmers of the poor world and that we can put together a trade  agreement that will make real sense to us all, hopefully by the end of the year at the Hong  Kong ministerial meeting.  But thank you Jean, for your hospitality and as I said at the  beginning, it’s always a pleasure to be in Luxembourg.

 Question:  ….[inaudible] you’ve been talking about the divisions that have existed between  Europe and those countries who have supported the US ….now that President seems to  be ….over Iran, do you think Australia could act as a mediator to tell the US, “come on, don’t  do it”?   

 Mr Downer:  Well I think it’s very important in Europe not to misunderstand America.  You  often tell America that they should understand Europe and that’s a fair point.  It’s also  important for Europeans to understand Americans.  President Bush isn’t preparing for an  invasion of Iran and to go out into the community and create false fear is an irresponsible  thing to do.   I think we all need to get behind the EU3 initiative on Iran.  I think that’s been a  thoughtful and a sensible and peaceful contribution to solving the problem of Iran’s emerging  nuclear program.  And if the EU3 agreement can be made to work, that’s going to be a very  important breakthrough.  You know, it’s a carrot and stick approach, it’s not going to be easy  to implement it all.  We hope the Americans will provide good support to the EU3, we think  they will.  Australia is supporting the EU3 on Iran.   

 On the other hand, there is a saying: “weakness is provocative”.  If you show weakness to  dictatorships, you will always find yourself disappointed by them.  And it’s not for any of us  to be weak when we are trying to stop Iran developing a nuclear program, or to stand up for  human rights in Iran, or to discourage the Iranians from supporting terrorism in the Middle  East.  We’ve got to make it clear that we are strong in our opposition to those things: it  doesn’t mean we are going to go to war with Iran but it does mean we are going to be strong  and decisive.   

 Mr Asselborn:  The American President’s declaration last night, to cooperate with the EU3  on this issue, is very important and helpful to find a solution together.  It’s very important to  say to Iran: “don’t go the way of nuclear arms”.  In this way the Europeans and the United  States can work together to create a real pressure on Iran to find a solution on this issue.   

 Question:  …from Greece…[inaudible]…. Like to ask the Australian minister if your  government plans to harmonise your immigration policies with European policies?   

 Mr Downer: Harmonise with European policy?  Well, no, we are an independent country.   We are the world’s sixth-oldest continuously-operating democracy.   My first challenge in  terms of harmony is harmony with the Australian people.  You can have whatever policies  you like in Europe, that’s your problem. We have a very good immigration policy in  Australia.  We have 20 million people and we take about 120,000 migrants every year in  Australia.  And we take migrants from all over the world.  We also have a refugee program.   We take refugees out of refugee camps all over the world, in Africa, in Asia, in the Middle  East.  We have been doing this for years and we are continuing to do it.  We have increased  our migration program quite a lot over the past ten years.  But, you know, if you want to come  to Australia, you come on honest terms.  If you want to cheat, if you want to pretend to be a  refugee when you are not a refugee, if you want to try to get in to our country with lies - by  lying that you are a refugee and being persecuted when we find out that you are not, by  breaking our visa restrictions, well then, you are not the sort of person we want in our country  and we will send you back.  So we love to take migrants, our country is filled by migrants -  it’s a migrant country.  Our country is made up of people from 130-140 countries around the

 world, including from Luxembourg.  Migrants are welcome to come to Australia, but not law-breakers.
