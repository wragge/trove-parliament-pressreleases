  Ministers launch W A migrant settlement plan 

  MPS 127/97 

  A plan to address settlement needs of newly-arrived migrants in Western Australia has been  launched today by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, and  the W A Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs , Mike Board. 

  Mr Ruddock said the Settlement Plan would help to ensure that migrants arriving in Western  Australia were able to settle successfully, and quickly become contributing members of the  community. 

  "The Plan aims to make the best use of Commonwealth , State, local government and community  resources in delivering settlement services ," he said. "It provides a framework to mesh effectively  with national planning strategies and structures." 

  The Plan will be regularly updated and evaluated to ensure its continued relevance to community  needs. 

  Priority settlement planning issues in the W A Settlement Plan include aged care , education and  ethnic youth, English language tuition , housing, health, and on-arrival settlement assistance. 

  The principles underpinning the delivery of services are those articulated in the Charter of Public  Service in a Culturally Diverse Society. These principles are also reflected in the WA  Government's initiative "Valuing Diversity" which was recently launched by Mr Board. 

  Mr Board said the Settlement Plan included cooperative initiatives and the combined efforts of  several W A agencies. 

  "The State Education and Health Departments and the Association for Services to Torture and  Trauma Survivors are working together on a project to enhance educational outcomes for  children arriving under the humanitarian program," Mr Board said. 

  "Strategies include identifying students at risk because of their refugee trauma experiences ;  increased support within the school systems; and providing therapeutic counselling to students in  need. 

  "Collaborative projects such as these represent an investment for both the students benefiting  from the services and for the community as a whole," he said. 

  Both Ministers acknowledged the contributions of Commonwealth , State, local government and  community agencies involved in the development of the plan and look forward to seeing positive  outcomes in the coming year.
