 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  OPPOSITION SPOKESMAN ON IMMIGRATION    

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Marles welcomes challenging new role 

 18 October 2013 

 Richard Marles today welcomed his new role as Opposition Spokesman on  Immigration, vowing a return to consensus on the importance of immigrants in  Australian society, and on effective policies to stop people-smuggling. 

 Mr Marles thanked Opposition Leader Bill Shorten for entrusting him with the  portfolio. 

 “This has been a challenging policy area for Labor over the last few years,  and one marked by unfortunate language about invasions and illegals,” he  said. 

 “I think we need to remind Australians of the importance of immigration to the  prosperity and cultural richness of this country while ensuring an orderly  immigration process.” 

 He said part of his new job was to hold Prime Minster Abbott to account on  Operation Sovereign Borders. 

  “Regional co-operation on offshore processing is proving effective as a  deterrent to people-smugglers and to those refugees who they exploit,” he  said. 

 “However, this does not give the Government an excuse to use the cloak of  military secrecy to hide from Australians information about boat arrivals and  operations involving asylum-seekers.” 

 Mr Marles said he would also campaign for the increased humanitarian intake  implemented under the previous Labor Government. 

 “Australia has long been generous in providing a home to the world’s  dispossessed,” he said. “There is no reason that this should change because  of a change of Government.”
