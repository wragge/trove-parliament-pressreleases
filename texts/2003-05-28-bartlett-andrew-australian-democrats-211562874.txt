 Senator Andrew Bartlett   Leader of the Australian Democrats  Spokesperson for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs    May 28, 2003                        MEDIA RELEASE                                03/ 373              

 Children in Detention Can No Longer Be Ignored   

 The Howard Government cannot continue to ignore reports detailing the appalling treatment of  children in Australian immigration detention centres, the Australian Democrats said today.   

 Democrats’ Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said the ChilOut report on children in detention,  released today, added to the bulk of evidence of maltreatment of detainees presented to the  Government and Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock.   

 “The Heart of the Nation's Existence is a review of reports on the treatment of children in  Australian immigration detention centres,” Senator Bartlett said.    

 “It documents allegations and confirmed reports of child abuse and neglect.   

 “There has to be an examination of these allegations and the Department, which did not prevent  these occurrences and continues to ignore the victims of its policies, must itself be investigated.    

 “This report gives us yet another reason to conduct a judicial inquiry into detention centres.  The  report claims that five of the 12 principles and 69 of the 107 standards listed as part of Australasian  Correctional Management’s 1998 contract with the Department have been breached.   

 “If the human rights abuses detailed in this report occurred in any other sector, like schools or  prisons or hospitals, the Minister would be held accountable.  It is outrageous that Mr Ruddock  continues to hide behind contracts and inflexible policy as a reason for his failure to carry out his  duties. 

 

 “There have been more than 25 reports and investigations just in the last few years revealing the  huge damage being done to children and adults in detention centres,” Senator Bartlett said.   

 “Every single one of these reports highlights the trauma, despair and human rights abuses that occur  in detention centres.  Every report adds to the case for stopping the policy of mandatory detention of  all asylum seekers.   

 “This report is the latest in the bulk of evidence.  Mr Ruddock cannot possibly continue to  heartlessly ignore these findings.   

 “The ChilOut report provides evidence and the perfect opportunity for a judicial inquiry into  Australian immigration detention centres.”
