 THE HON NICOLA ROXON MP  Minister for Health and Ageing  ROB MITCHELL MP  Member for McEwen 

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 6 December 2011           

 47 COMMUNITIES STEP INTO SUMMER WITH HEALTHY HABITS    

 47 communities around the nation will step into summer with healthy habits as a  result of new healthy eating and exercise programs designed to help combat  obesity.    

 Minister for Health and Ageing Nicola Roxon today joined Member for McEwen  Rob Mitchell to announce that 47 local governments around the country will  receive funding to run programs that encourage and support people to adopt and  sustain healthier lifestyles.    

 Minister Roxon said that each local government will receive a grant of $566,000  as part of the third round of the Gillard Government’s $72 million Healthy  Communities Initiative.    

 “We want to keep Australians healthy and out of hospital and programs like  Healthy Communities provide practical support to people looking to make a  change,” Minister Roxon said.    

 “Stepping confidently into summer with healthy habits will be made easier by  getting involved in local walking groups, cycling to work or getting your hands  dirty in a community garden.    

 “Over 77% of the local government areas selected have combined rates of  overweight and obesity rates above the Australian average and experience  significant social and economic disadvantage, so we are targeting this funding  where its needed the most.    

 Member for McEwen Rob Mitchell said innovative physical activity and healthy  eating programs have been proven to make a real difference to local  communities.    

 “Programs like Healthy Communities make it easier for families looking to make a  healthy change.” 

 

 “We know that preventive health measures work and these projects will focus on  at-risk populations, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, culturally and  linguistically diverse communities, new wave migrants and those living with  disabilities.” 

 

 The Healthy Communities program is part of a $872 million commitment to  preventive health promotion, the largest ever made by an Australian  Government. 45 local governments received funding in the first two rounds.    

 In round three, there will be 13 projects in New South Wales, 11 in Victoria, 9 in  Queensland, 7 in Western Australia, 6 in South Australia, and 1 in Tasmania.  Details of each project are provided below.
