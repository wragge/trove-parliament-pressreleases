 MEDIA RELEASE

 TOWNSVILLE BUILDING A RESILIENT REFUGEE COMMUNITY   

 The Townsville Intercultural Centre, Building a Resilient Refugee Community Project  has today been awarded a $30,000 grant to help local refugees build positive  relationships with each other and the wider community to strengthen their resilience  against violent extremism.    

 Attorney-General Nicola Roxon congratulated the Townsville Intercultural Centre and  said it was important local groups were equipped to assist with social and settlement  issues for refugees.   

 “We want to help Australian communities build a culture of respect and tolerance that  rejects home-grown violent extremism,” Attorney-General Nicola Roxon said.   

 “These grants, like this one here in Townsville will fund practical new activities to  build respect and tolerance across communities, while also challenging ideologies  that support violence.   

 “Australia is a very safe country, but we canât be complacent and itâs important to  give local communities the tools they need to reduce the appeal of violent  extremism.   

 “The aim of the âBuilding a Resilient Refugee Community Projectâ is to build  relationships within the community that focus on the benefits of life in Australia and  counteract the focus on conflict and isolation.     

 “What this grant hopes to achieve is that the refugee community has open dialogue  on the confronting issue of violent extremism, has engaged across cultures and  faiths and has gained knowledge and skills to be proactive in building a resilient  community.”   

 Senator for Queensland, Jan McLucas, congratulated the Townsville Intercultural  Centre.    

 “The Centre plays an important role in supporting newcomers to the Townsville  region, helping them to settle as quickly as possible and participate in the  community,” Senator McLucas said.  

 

 “I look forward to them continuing to deliver a range of important services for the  local community.”    

 The program already supports 29 projects worth more than $2.8 million across the  country, and is kicking some early goals through initiatives like the national youth  mentoring and leadership project for vulnerable youth run by the Australian  Multicultural Foundation.   

 The 2012-13 program offers two categories of grants funding - the first category is  from $5,000 to $20,000 and the second category is from $20,001 to $100,000  (excluding GST).    

 The grant is the first under the current round of the Building Community Resilience  Grants Program.  Other grant recipients will be announced in due course.
