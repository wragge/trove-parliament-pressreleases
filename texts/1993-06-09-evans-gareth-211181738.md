 AUSTRALIAN EMERGENCY RELIEF FOR THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES

 Australia will provide further emergency relief worth $325,000 for the Occupied Territories, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Gareth Evans announced today.

 Assistance will be channelled through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and brings to around $3 million the total amount provided in 1992/93.

 "In the Middle East, the recent closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip has created urgent needs for basic living requirements and food for Palestinian refugees," Senator Evans said.

 "The local economy has been disrupted by the closure and movement restrictions, resulting in losses of millions of dollars in agriculture, industry, transport and commerce. While there are now signs of hope with the resumption of the Middle East peace talks, the economic, social and security situation in the Occupied Territories is now worse than ever.

 "Tens of thousands of Palestinian workers are unable to reach their workplaces in Israel, resulting in over 50 per cent unemployment.

 "Australian funds will assist UNRWA to provide emergency food parcels to an additional 12,000 families," Senator Evans said.
