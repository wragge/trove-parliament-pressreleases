 AMA SHINES LIGHT ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND THE  HEALTH NEEDS OF DISADVANTAGED AND MINORITY GROUPS OF  WOMEN  AMA Position Statement on Women’s Health 2014   

 The AMA today released the updated AMA Position Statement on Women’s Health.   

 The Position Statement was launched at Parliament House in Canberra by the Minister  Assisting the Prime Minister for Women, Senator Michaelia Cash, Senator for the Northern  Territory, Nova Peris, and AMA President, Dr Steve Hambleton.   

 Dr Hambleton said that all women have the right to the highest attainable standard of physical  and mental health.   

 “The AMA has always placed a high priority on women’s health, and this is reflected in the  breadth and diversity of our Position Statement,” Dr Hambleton said.   

 “We examine biological, social and cultural factors, along with socioeconomic circumstances  and other determinants of health, exposure to health risks, access to health information and  health services, and health outcomes.   

 “And we shine a light on contemporary and controversial issues in women’s health.   

 “There is a focus on violence against women, including through domestic and family violence  and sexual assault.   

 “These are significant public health issues that have serious and long-lasting detrimental  consequences for women’s health.   

 “It is estimated that more than half of Australian women have experienced some form of  physical or sexual violence in their lifetimes.   

 “The AMA wants all Australian governments to work together on a coordinated, effective, and  appropriately resourced national approach to prevent violence against women.   

 “We need a system that provides accessible health service pathways and support for women  and their families who become victims of violence.   

 “It is vital that the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children is  implemented and adequately funded.”   

 Dr Hambleton said the updated AMA Position Statement also highlights areas of women’s  health that are seriously under-addressed.   

 “This includes improving the health outcomes for disadvantaged groups of women, including  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, rural women, single mothers, and women from  refugee and culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds,” Dr Hambleton said.

 “We also highlight the unique health issues experienced by lesbian and bisexual women in the  community.”   

 Dr Hambleton said that the AMA recognises the important work of Australian governments  over many years to raise the national importance of women’s health, including the National  Women’s Health Policy.   

 “There has been ground-breaking policy in recent decades, but much more needs to be done if  we are to achieve high quality equitable health care that serves the diverse needs of Australian  women,” Dr Hambleton said.   

 “Although women as a group have a higher life expectancy than men, they experience a higher  burden of chronic disease and tend to live more years with a disability.   

 “Because they tend to live longer than men, women represent a growing proportion of older  people, and the corresponding growth in chronic disease and disability has implications for  health policy planning and service demand.”   

 The Position Statement contains AMA recommendations about the need to factor in gender  considerations and the needs of women across a range of areas in health, including:  ï· health promotion, disease prevention and early intervention;  ï· sexual and reproductive health; 

 ï· chronic disease management and the ageing process;  ï· mental health and suicide;  ï· inequities between different sub-populations of Australian women, and their different  needs; 

 ï· health services and workforce; and  ï· health research, data collection and program evaluation.   

 Background:  ï· cardiovascular disease - including heart attack, stroke, and other heart and blood vessel  diseases - is the leading cause of death in women;  ï· for women under 34 years of age, suicide is the leading cause of death; and  ï· in general, women report more episodes of ill health, consult medical practitioners and 

 other health professionals more frequently, and take medication more often than men.
