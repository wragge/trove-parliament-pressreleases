 Teenage girls assaulted on Nauru, refugees  not safe: Greens   

 Reports that a group of teenage girls who have been resettled on Nauru have been assaulted,  with threats of worse to come, show why refugees should not be sent there, the Australian  Greens have said.   

 “These young girls aren’t safe on Nauru and the Abbott government just doesn’t care,” the  Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “It’s clear that there is no future for these refugees, either on Nauru or in Cambodia. The girls  aren’t even safe in their school, let alone on the streets in Phnom Penh.   

 “These girls should be brought back to Australia immediately, before more harm is done. I also  have grave concerns for the babies who will now be sent to Nauru, as a result of Scott  Morrison’s Blackmail Bill last week.   

 “The sad thing is that this cruelty isn’t unnecessary.   

 “We should be processing refugee claims in Malaysia and Indonesia, while increasing  resettlement in Australia. We can save lives at sea while caring for refugees by offering a safer  way to reach protection.”
