 MEDIA ALERT

 POLITICIANS IN THE ARCHIVES  - ABC  CENSORSHIP?   

 Recently, the ABC refused to allow filmmaker Judy Rymer to use archival news  footage in her film about refugee issues, "Punished Not Protected".    

 The ABC insisted she first get the personal permission of the politicians involved which  was unprecedented and tantamount to political censorship.   

 A panel discussion organised by Dr Willa McDonald of Macquarie Universityâ€™s Media  Department will be held to discuss this important contemporary issue.    

 

 The panel will include:    * Michael Organ MP Greens Member for Cunningham and former  University of Wollongong Archivist and Copyright Officer,    * Filmmaker Judy Rymer and 

  * Lawyer Roy Baker  

 

 WHEN:  Thursday 26 August 2004 at 6.30 for 7pm.  WHERE: The Gaelic Club, 64 Devonshire Street, Surry Hills, Sydney.   

 Part of Rymer's film, "Punished not Protected", plus the Media Watch segment that  drew attention to the ABC's actions, will be shown on the night.
