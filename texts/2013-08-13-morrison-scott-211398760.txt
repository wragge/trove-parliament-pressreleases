 MORRISON:   

 Over the last five years, we have seen the chaos and we’ve seen the cost and we’ve seen the tragedy  that followed Kevin Rudd’s decision to abolish the proven measures of John Howard.  It is I think  Kevin Rudd’s biggest mistake, the baddest decision that he has had in his time as Prime Minister and  today we have seen further details on the cost element of what followed from that terrible decision  of his to get rid of the measures that worked.  Over the course of the last six years, we have seen the  cost, just to the Immigration Department, of dealing with those who have come to Australia illegally  by boat increase from just $85 million a year to now, in this financial year, $3.3 billion, $3,300 million  a year.  That’s around about twice what the entire Department of Immigration used to cost when I  first became Shadow Minister in this portfolio.  It’s more than a 35 fold increase in the cost of  dealing with this issue.  That is the consequence of Kevin Rudd’s decision to get rid of the border  protection measures that worked.      

 The combined cost of dealing with this over the last 6 years is now $9.1 billion including this financial  year.  That’s what’s actually been spent and committed to be spent this year.  Of that $9.1 billion,  just over a billion of that is in capital expenditure.  This government has run its own economic  stimulus package off the back of its poor decisions on asylum seekers and failed border protection,  with over a billion dollars in a building the detention centre revolution which has been running  around not only this country, but offshore now for the last five years.      

 The cumulative blowout in the budget, year on year on year over the forward estimates since 2009-10 until today’s statement, was $11.6 billion and when you think about the hospitals, the schools,  the roads, the university funding and all of this that could have been funded, not also considering I 

 suppose, the debt interest that has to be paid, which will rise to over $10 billion a year under this  Government’s poor management.  When you think about the cost of Labor’s border failures, it is  absolutely mind numbing. $11.6 billion in blowouts since the economic statement with the  information that was released in that just a short time ago.      

 With PEFO we get a warning from the Treasury and from the Department of Finance.  We already  know what the cost so far has been of more than 50,000 people turning up on the Labor party’s  watch because of their failed border protection but the warning from Treasury today in the PEFO  release today is the blowouts are not over yet.  What the estimates contain is under ‘Scenario Two’  in this document, there is potential for a further $3.5 billion expense to the bottom line over the  next four years if the rather optimistic forecast, which the Treasurer has described as prudent today,  I would call them optimistic, were to be failed after this election with the further unravelling of their  government’s election fix policy on PNG.  A further $3.5 billion would mean over the course of the  next term, Labor’s budget blowouts on border protection would rise to over $15 billion.  That is the  cost of Labor’s failure and the warning in this document is you need a government on the other side  of this election that can do what is required on border protection to get our borders back under  control.      

 In the first term of the Labor Government, 7,500 people turned up illegally by boat.  In the second  term more than 40,000 have turned up and we’re still counting.  This document assumes less than  25,000 will turn up over the course of the next three years.  Now this is not the form of the Labor  Party, boat arrivals going down.  This document backs against the form of the Labor Party when it  comes to their solutions actually delivering an outcome.  It’s a year today since we had the hand  down of the report, I understand, of the Houston Panel and what we are now dealing with is another  set of measures which the government says will work but every time we know when Labor says it  works and then they claim all sorts of things in the weeks that follow, we always know how it  ends.  It all unravels, it all falls apart and it ends up being a lot worse, a lot worse, than when they  first started.  So the warning is there that a figure of around about, just over in fact, $3.5 billion  would be added to the $11.6 billon blowout that has been set out in the budget papers now over  some years and that would take the cumulative blowout to over $15 billion.      

 I also note that in this document, the government has not been able to publish what the costs are of  the capital on Nauru.  That is something we will have to seek directly from the Department but as we  know, the Nauru centre was burnt down under this government and that will have to be rebuilt  which forms a key part of the Coalition’s policies for offshore processing.  So the warnings are there,  the warnings, I think, of the government’s form on border protection failures point to costs going up,  not down, from 7,500 to over 40,000 in this term.  If Labor is re-elected for a third term, then the  sky’s the limit based on their form of failed border protection.    

 QUESTION:  You just quoted a lot of numbers there, we know some of the latest numbers, what are your  numbers, what are the Coalition costs for border protection [inaudible]?    

 MORRISON:   

 We’ve already announced what Operation Sovereign Borders would cost to put that in place.  The  figures we’ve announced actually deal with the arrivals going down and over the forward  estimates.  That’s the whole point of stopping the boats.  That’s why our policies are so  important.  That’s why our resolve is so important.  You don’t stop the cost if you don’t stop the  boats and our policy is designed to stop the boats, which does stop the cost.  That was our form in  government.  I mean, the average ten year arrivals which is the target of what’s put out in these 

 documents is 370.  That’s more than turned up in the last six years of the Howard Government and  that’s their target for one year.  So the Coalition’s policies are all about reducing that cost, not  increasing that cost, as this government’s form has shown.    

 QUESTION:   

 Just referring to some comments made by the PNG High Commissioner to Australia who said in an  interview with the ABC today that the border is porous and that both governments know this.  What  would you say to that given your previous comments about a torrent of asylum seekers coming  across?    

 MORRISON:   

 Well that border is porous.  It always has been.  He’s right.  And that’s why the government’s policy  to resettle thousands of people in Papua New Guinea will open that border to the risk of being  transgressed and it’s a very difficult border to police.  As I said in this place just this week, the only  real defence against that is the fact that the government’s policy of resettlement is likely to fail  because of the extreme difficulty of resettling people in Papua New Guinea.  And we still, I’m waiting  every day for Tony Burke to come in here and tell us where will people be resettled?  On what  land?  With what benefits?  In what houses?  With what health care?  In what schools?  Where’s the  resettlement arrangement?  I mean, there was over a twenty page document that went into the  guidelines for how 800 people would be taken from Australia to Malaysia.  There is no such  document for the PNG arrangement at all.  There is a five page agreement, three of which is  preamble, and there is no detail as to how resettlement will actually take place in Papua New  Guinea.  If it were in fact to take place at the levels the governments are suggesting, then that would  leave the Torres Strait border, I think, very much exposed.     

 QUESTION:    

 The Prime Minister says you’re fear-mongering.    

 MORRISON:   

 Well I think the Prime Minister should put his jar of Vegemite away and get a bit real. If he doesn’t  want to consider the weaknesses of his own policies, if he can’t see the gaping holes in the policies  which he’s announced, then that only underscores our point.  That is, Labor never thinks these  things through when it comes to border protection.  I’ve just been there before them on so many  occasions; Malaysia, East Timor the Houston Panel.  All of these things.  They come and they go and  the boats keep coming, the costs keep going up and the Australian taxpayer keeps getting hit and  people continually get put at risk.  I’ve grown very tired of Labor’s big bold claims because I know  they end in chaos and they end in cost and they end in tragedy.  That’s why this government cannot  be trusted on a third occasion because we know what happens when they get another go.    

 QUESTION:   

 You’ve said you’d salvage some of the PNG solution if you could, so you would probably inherit some  of those costs, have you factored that into your own -     

 MORRISON:   

 Well they are in the government’s costs so obviously we inherit what the government has in their 

 own forward estimates.  The salvaging prospects, I think, rely principally in the area of offshore  processing.  We have always been committed to offshore processing in PNG and so people being  sent to PNG is not new.  The fact they’re being sent in such small numbers, I mean, they’ve taken  more people off PNG than they’ve sent to PNG.  I noticed the Prime Minister yesterday endeavoured  another “mission accomplished” moment with the PNG arrangement claiming reductions of 30 per  cent.  The five months to the 19th of July, that’s the post monsoon figure over the course of this year,  the average daily arrivals were 99.  Under the arrangement over the first 20 odd days since the PNG  announcement, the average arrivals a day were 108.  So the Prime Minister can try and spin these  numbers any way he likes but he can’t spin the boats away, he can’t spin the cost away, he can’t spin  his record away and his record says more boats, more cost, more failure.    

 QUESTION:   

 If the border is porous as you’ve suggested as well, is that therefore setting [inaudible] there could  be a chance that costs could blowout if it does turn into more people coming rather than going?    

 MORRISON:   

 We will work through the detail of what arrangements have been put in place with Papua New  Guinea if we are elected, and we will have a better understanding of what actually exists, but what’s  clear at the moment, is that there is very little in terms of detail about the potential resettlement of  people in Papua New Guinea.  That’s why I say, the greatest defence against this border opening up  will be the failure of the government’s policy because the resettlement difficulties of putting people  in Papua New Guinea I think are very real and we would have to work through those details.  But  again, it shows that the government is making this big, bold claim for their election fix that  thousands of people will be resettled in Papua New Guinea.  Now they’re the ones who are saying  that and so they are the ones who are going to have to say how they are going to police that border,  given the risks of having thousands of people resettled in PNG in that way.  And you’ve got complete  silence from them on that.  Absolute crickets when it comes to the resettlement arrangement and all  the measures they would have to put in place to sure up that northern border.      

 QUESTION:   

 Your own record on costings isn’t exactly great.  In February 2012 -     

 MORRISON:   

 Well what do you base that on?    

 QUESTION:    

 In February 2012 you said you could get Howard’s Pacific Solution on Nauru up and running for $10  million.      

 MORRISON:    

 I’ve never said that.    

 QUESTION:    

 Yes you did -  

 

 MORRISON:   

 No, I did not say that.  The costing on that was $90 million.      

 QUESTION:   

 You put out a media release, you said $10 million to get it up and running - $7 million for 1,000 - no  you put it out.   

 MORRISON:   

 I’m sorry.  You’re wrong.      

 MORRISON:   

 I know what the figure was, I remember the press conference.  I was there, you may not have  been.  The figure was just over $90 million for establishing the permanent accommodation on  Nauru.    

 QUESTION:   

 $10 million to get it up and running,  $7 million for 1,000 beds plus $50 million for staff  accommodation.  So, and it’s cost hundreds of millions of dollars since then so -     

 MORRISON:   

 Well I can’t be accountable for the government and how they waste money, can I?    

 QUESTION:   

 Are you saying you could do it cheaper?    

 MORRISON:   

 We always believed we can do these things better than the Labor Party because we’ve got the form  of doing that.  Remember, we established Nauru in 19 days when the Howard Government put it  into place.  The Labor Party had to be dragged kicking and screaming to do offshore processing.  I  mean, just think about it.  Since August of last year they said they were going to do offshore  processing on Nauru and Manus Island.  What they were able to achieve in a full year was less than  350 beds on Manus Island, they put families on, they took families off and on Nauru they had a  maximum of 900 beds in the course of a year.  And now Tony Burke comes in here and tells you he  can establish a 3,000 man camp in the space of a couple of weeks.  Now, I’ll let the Australian people  judge the Coalition and the government when it comes to our record in putting these matters in  place.  But one thing the Coalition, I think, has in advantages here is we believe in these policies,  we’ve done them before, we know how to do them and we are committed to them.  The Labor Party  have had every point on the compass on border protection, including offshore processing and that’s  why you can’t trust them.  Any more questions?   Thanks for your time.
