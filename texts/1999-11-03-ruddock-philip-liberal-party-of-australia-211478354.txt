  REFERENCE GROUP TO LOOK AT PEOPLE SMUGGLING

  

  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today announced he has created  a high profile Reference Group 
to advise on Australia’s effectiveness in combating people smuggling.

  

 Mr Ruddock said the Reference Group would include 
former Liberal Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1982-83), 
John Hodges, former Chief of Air Force (1987-92), Air Marshall Ray Funnell 
and former Labor Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic 
Affairs (1990-93), Gerry Hand.

  

 “The external Reference Group is the latest initiative 
the Government has introduced in its fight against the dehumanising 
and exploitative crime of people smuggling,” said the Minister.

  

 “The group, which comprises three very highly regarded 
individuals with a good working knowledge of the complex issues relating 
to people smuggling, will work with my Department to look at the phenomenon 
both in Australia and source countries, and report back late this month.”

  

 The Minister said the Group had been set up to examine 
the reasons behind the sharp increase in unauthorised arrivals to Australia 
this year, and the increasingly sophisticated methods being used by 
smugglers.

  

 “Last month alone we saw a total of 421 illegal 
boat people arrive on our shores,” said the Minister, “and yesterday 
another boat carrying 352 people arrived to take the total this financial 
year to 1,280.

  

 “In addition, we have seen people smugglers become 
smarter in their attempts to avoid detection. They are taking new routes 
that allow them to remain undetected in international waters as they 
make their way to Australia, and as they ferry their human cargo to 
shore.

  

 “The UNHCR works with the international community 
to meet the protection needs of refugees,” said the Minister. “Australia 
makes a very generous contribution to this effort through its humanitarian 
program.

  

 “Refugees should not take matters into their own 
hands and put their lives at risk and line the smugglers’ pockets.

  

 “Illegal migrants - those without protection needs 
- should not contemplate coming to Australia. Their efforts are futile 
and they will be detained and sent home.”

  

 The Minister said that as part of the Government’s 
latest crackdown on illegal entrants, he last week launched an Overseas 
Information Campaign in Sydney that will see a range of publicity material 
distributed throughout high risk people smuggling source countries, 
as well as transit countries.

  

 “The new campaign is designed to warn people of 
the risks associated with trying to enter Australia illegally and the 
penalties smugglers face,” said Mr Ruddock.

  

 “The campaign emphasises that Australia has introduced 
even tougher penalties for people smugglers. We want to send a clear 
message that people smuggling rackets will not be tolerated in Australia.”
