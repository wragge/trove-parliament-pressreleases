 THE HON. RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 

 STATEMENT ON MR HAMID KEHAZAEI     

 Labor extends deep sympathy to the family and friends of Mr Hamid Kehazaei.    

 The 24 year-old asylum seeker is currently at Brisbaneâ€™s Mater Hospital, following  his transfer from the Manus Island Regional Resettlement Facility.    

 This is clearly an extremely difficult time for the family and friends of Mr  Kehazaei and Labor is concerned about the circumstances of his situation.    

 Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has taken the right step in asking the  Department's Chief Medical Officer to review the clinical treatment of Mr  Kehazaei at Manus Island and at the Mater Hospital.    

 Mr Morrison needs to ensure that review is made public as soon as possible.    

 Labor has strong concerns about the lack of transparency surrounding the  treatment of asylum seekers under the Abbott Government.    

 Every single Australian funded facility must be run in a manner that is safe,  humane, dignified and allows for proper oversight.
