The Committee found that in the a^ult Migrant Education Program (AMEP), relationships between the Commonwealth and the States were "unusually harmonious".Mr Hurford said the AMEP showed that Commonwealth and State and Northern Territory Governments could work well together in the best interests of migrants.The committee had found that the AMEP was unique to Australia. No other country had a national program of language learning available to all adult non-English- speaking migrants."Programs such as this are one of the reasons why Australia's migration program has been so successful,"Mr Hurford said.The "Towards Active Voice" report is the result of six months' work by the committee, which received 770 submissions and conducted consultations in all States and Territories. It met with organisations and individuals involved in the English language program, including representatives of teachers, students, employers, unions and ethnic and voluntary organisations.2/....Parliament House, Canberra

 Its key recommendations deal with improving the quality of  the Adult Migration Education Program in such areas as  teacher training, materials development, educational  counselling and increasing effectiveness.

 "Everyone in Australia deserves a fair go," Mr Hurford  said. "The Government is determined that migrants who  cannot understand English also get a fair go. One way of  doing this is to help such people to learn English. It is 

 for this reason that the Government gives the Adult  Migrant Education Program such priority."

 Mr Hurford said that the Government would consider the  report's recommendations after discussions with community  groups.
