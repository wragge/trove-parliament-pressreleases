 GROUP TRANSFERRED TO CHRISTMAS ISLAND   

 The group of 85 people intercepted by HMAS Success on 21 February will be transferred  to Christmas Island today.   

 They will be accommodated temporarily on Christmas Island while health checks and  information gathering processes continue.   

 The group will become offshore entry people under the Migration Act and, in line with  long-standing Government policy, will be managed off-shore and will not be brought to  the mainland.   

 The Australian Government is exploring a range of options for the handling of this group.  Preliminary discussions have commenced with both Indonesia and Nauru.   

 While the Government is considering options, clearly no action would be taken which  would breach our international obligations.   

 Any suggestion that Australia would agree to an arrangement which would see refugees  returned to a country where they face persecution is wrong.   

 The Government continues to work with other countries in the region, including Indonesia  and Nauru, to combat people smuggling.   

 As demonstrated by the Border Protection Command’s detection and interception of this  boat, Australia’s border protection regime is working.     

 We have in place appropriate and effective capabilities to manage our borders and  preserve Australia’s sovereignty.
