 CREATIVE STATISTICS

 The Department of Immigration's use of statistics to justify its compliance effort in  relation to the reduction of Australia's large illegal population is most creative.

 The Department has apparently trebled the number of compliance officers nationally to  implement its "hard-line" policy on illegal entrants. The result of this increased activity,  according to the Departm ent is the deportation or voluntary departure of some 3,500 of  illegal entrants during the July-September quarter. This represents a doubling of the  figure for the same time last year.

 The department's statement however, raises rather more serious issues than those it  purports to address.

 The Department has omitted to provide an updated figure on the net number of illegal  entrants still in Australia.

 More importantly, in its difficulty with statistics, the Department has not mentioned that  in the same period of time, and according to its last projections on the number of people  in Australia illegally for less than 12 months, an additional 10,000 people could have  become illegal in the same 3-month period.

 Thus, instead of benefiting from a trebling of compliance officers we seem to be going  out backwards with the achievement of a net gain in illegals in the July-September  period. '

 The costs associated with illegal entrants in Australia is astronomical.

 In an answer to a question in Senate Estimates, the department revealed that during  1990-91, compliance officers located 9253 illegal entrants but were only able to effect the  departure of 4862. The remainder exercised their eligibility to apply for change of status  or refugee status.

 Senator Ray, as immigration minister, estimated that the cost of locating illegals was  approximately $9,000 per person in 1988. Thus in the last financial year it would appear  to have cost the Australian taxpayer some $45 million to find illegals only to see them  remain in Australia on another basis.

 It is urgent for the Minister to find ways to effectively deal with this growing problem.  Every day it gets larger and more unmanageable and every day the public confidence in,  and acceptance of, Australia's immigration program is undermined.
