 Michael Keenan 

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs 

 Labor squanders millions on their border protection failures  Friday, 23 April 2010    

 Reports in today’s News Limited papers indicate that the Rudd Labor  Government plans - yet again - to throw money at a policy problem of their own  creation.   Sources have indicated that Labor will be spending $200 million in the upcoming  Budget to tackle the flood of illegal boat arrivals that have descended upon  Australia on their watch.   Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said  this was just another bandaid solution by a government which is refusing to take  real action to address the problem.   “It makes no difference how much money Labor throws at the problem, the  boats are arriving because Mr Rudd has turned Australia into a soft touch for  people smugglers when he dismantled our border protection laws,” said Mr  Keenan.   “When this Labor Government wants to appear to be doing something they  either have a review or throw money at the problem.   “In this instance, they are spending money needlessly to fix what is actually a  policy problem.”   Indonesia's Foreign Affairs Minister Marty Natalegawa on Lateline yesterday  acknowledged that pull factors have played a key role in bringing asylum  seekers to Indonesia, and then on to Australia.   “Why can’t Mr Rudd see what everyone else can? His border protection policies  have failed and made us a soft touch for this insidious people smuggling trade.   “Throwing more money at the problem won’t stop the boats - its Labor’s policies  that have created the pull factor, and they need to address this immediately.”
