 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling OVER 14,000 ARRIVALS SINCE ELECTION July 25, 2012

 The arrival of another illegal boat, with 80 people on board, means over 14,000 people have arrived on boats since the election when Julia Gillard promised to ‘smash the people smugglers business model’, Shadow Minister for Immigration  and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "Julia Gillard went to the last election with the failed policy of her East Timor farce, she is now running on another failure in the  abominable  Malaysian  people  swap  and  she  continues  to  refuse  to  restore  the  proven  policies  of  the  Howard Government," Mr Morrison said. 

 "On average over 600 people have arrived every month under Labor since the election, close to 1,000 are arriving every month this year and since the budget an average of over 1,400 have been turning up every month. 

 "Treasurer Wayne Swan should be up front and explain how many cheques the Australian people will have to write for his government’s failure on our borders. 

 "Rather than stop the boats and budget blow outs, Labor’s only response is to appoint yet another committee and falsely claim  a  deadlock  that  is  entirely  of  their  own  making.  Labor  could  act  to  restore  the  polices  that  worked  today,"  Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr  Keenan  said:  "2012  is  on  the  cusp  of  becoming  the  biggest  year  for  boat  arrivals  ever  and  it  is  only  July  - yet  this   shameful record still doesn’t prompt the Gillard Government to fix the crisis they created at our borders. 

 "This is the 365th boat to arrive under Labor â with more than 1500 people arriving illegally by boat this month alone. 

 "Labor is clearly using the cross party committee as an excuse to do nothing, yet in the meantime thousands of people continue to make the dangerous voyage to Australia. 

 "We cannot afford to keep having boats arrive illegally in our country every single day - the Government must stop  prolonging the inevitable and address this catastrophe at our borders," Mr Keenan said.
