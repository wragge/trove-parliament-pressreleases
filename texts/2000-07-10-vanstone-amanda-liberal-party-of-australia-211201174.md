 Boat people detected off north-western Australia

 Customs Coastwatch today detected and detained a vessel off north-western Australia containing suspected illegal entrants, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, announced today.

 The Minister said this was the 24th vessel containing boat people to be detected in Australia this calendar year.

 "All 24 vessels have been intercepted before arriving on the Australian mainland," Senator Vanstone said.

 In today’s interception, initial reports indicate about 30 people, including three crew, were found aboard the motorised Indonesian fishing vessel which is now being towed to Ashmore Islands. It is believed the passengers are mostly of Middle Eastern origin.

 The vessel was detained by the Customs vessel Wauri, which is on long-term patrol off north-western Australia, near Ashmore Islands. Acting on information received, the ACV Wauri detected the approach of the vessel with the assistance of its surface-search radar system.

 Customs Coastwatch will arrange for the people to be transported to the mainland where they will be handed over to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.
