  MEDIA RELEASE

  Hanson the only winner in refugee debate

  

  Australia has moved another step closer to temporary visas for all 
refugees, according to the Austral ian Democrats.

  

 The major parties voted together today to defeat a 
Democrat motion opposing temporary visas for refugees who enter Australia 
without authority.

  

 “On refugee policy, Hanson’s One Nation party 
has won,” said Democrats’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew 
Bartlett.

  

 “When Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party released 
an immigration policy before the 1998 election that included temporary 
visas for refugees, the Immigration Minister described it as ‘a recipe 
for division’ and ‘obscene’. Yet the Coalition is implementing 
temporary visas for more and more refugees and the ALP is too gutless 
to vote against it.”

  

 Senator Bartlett said the Labor Party had put politics 
ahead of principle and basic human rights.

  

 Senator Bartlett also accused the Immigration Minister 
of hypocrisy in raising concern about the cost of detaining illegal 
immigrants while implementing policies which increase the cost.

  

 “The Minister is choosing to keep all illegal arrivals 
in detention. No other country in the world does it.”

  

 “The overcrowding in our detention centres and the 
cost to the tax payer is also worsened because of the length of time 
taken to assess people’s claims for refugee status,” said Senator 
Bartlett.

  

 “Now the Government has introduced temporary visas 
which will actually increase the immigration administration costs around 
refugees.

  

 “After three years here, refugees will have to undergo 
the same assessment process all over again.”

  

 “We should be targeting people smugglers not refugees.

  

 “Boat people will not be stopped by temporary visas 
but genuine refugees will be hurt.

  

 Temporary visas have been condemned by a wide range 
of community, ethnic, church and legal organisations that work with 
refugees.
