 GOVERNMENT OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA AGREEMENT TO EXPANSION OF MANUS ISLAND PROCESSING FACILITY

 I warmly welcome the decision by the Government of Papua New Guinea to agree to an expansion of the asylum seeker processing facility operating on Manus Island to accommodate up to 1000 people.

 Papua New Guinea has also agreed that persons processed in the centre are able to stay in Papua New Guinea for up to 12 months. These decisions are within the framework of the Memorandum of Understanding between Australia and Papua New Guinea concerning asylum seekers signed on 11 October 2001.

 People smuggling is a serious concern for our region.  Today’s decision by the Papua New Guinea Cabinet represents not only a commitment by one of the major countries in the region to take a key role in addressing this serious issue, but is also a strong endorsement of the Government’s policy on combating people smuggling operations.  The Regional Conference on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime, co-sponsored by Australia and Indonesia, will further combat this serious issue in our region.

 Australian officials will now work closely with their Papua New Guinea counterparts to facilitate the smooth expansion of the Manus Island facility.
