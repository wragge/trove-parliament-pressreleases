 IMMIGRATION DETENTION NO PLACE FOR CHILDREN  AMA Position Statement on the Health Care of Asylum Seekers and Refugees   

 AMA President, Dr Mukesh Haikerwal, said today there should be greater compassion and fairness  in providing health care for refugees and people in immigration detention, especially for children.   

 Dr Haikerwal made the comments when releasing the AMA’s Position Statement on the Health  Care of Asylum Seekers and Refugees at the Asylum Seeker Health Service in Melbourne.   

 Dr Haikerwal said while the Migration Act has been amended so that children should only be  detained as a last resort, unaccompanied children must never again be detained in immigration  detention and accompanied children should be detained for no more than one month.   

 “The negative impact of detention on children’s mental health is now well known and all  governments must do all in their power to ensure such inhumane treatment of children does not  happen again,” Dr Haikerwal said.   

 The AMA recommends that people seeking asylum in Australia have the right to necessary medical  care without discrimination, regardless of their citizenship, visa status or ability to pay.   

 “Asylum seekers must be treated with compassion, respect and dignity. They must receive the same  level of health care as Australian citizens, with access to Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits  Scheme,” Dr Haikerwal said.   

 “Asylum seekers on certain bridging visas have no Medicare access, no right to work, and no  income.   

 “These are some of the most vulnerable people seeking asylum. Many are women and children.   

 “Australia must urgently find an alternative to indeterminate periods of detention.   

 “Until then, the AMA wants the Federal Government to set in law an absolute maximum duration  that an asylum seeker can spend in detention.   

 “Living conditions must be humane, including access to unencumbered good quality ongoing health  care and emergency and specialist care, if needed, provided by the community health system,” Dr  Haikerwal said.   

 The Position Statement covers the health and welfare of asylum seekers, community based asylum  seekers, the role and responsibility of medical practitioners, immigration detention facilities  (including issues about children and hunger strikers), and Temporary Protection Visas.

  Health Care of Asylum Seekers and Refugees   

  2005   

  Preamble   

  The Australian Medical Association affirms that those seeking asylum within Australia have the right  to receive appropriate medical care without discrimination, regardless of citizenship, visa status, or  ability to pay. Like all seeking health care, those seeking asylum in Australia should be treated with  compassion, respect, and dignity.   

  Definitions   

  The United Nation’s 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (the Refugee Convention) 1 , 

  and the 1967 amendment entitled the Protocol Relating to Refugees 2 , to both of which Australia is a 

  signatory, define refugees as persons who are:  â¢ outside their country of nationality or their usual country of residence, and  â¢ unable or unwilling to return or to seek the protection of that country due to a well-founded  fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular 

  social group, or political opinion, and  â¢ not war criminals or people who have committed serious non-political crimes.    

  Asylum seekers are people who apply to the Government of a country for recognition as a refugee. 3   

  

  The AMA makes the following observations and recommendations in relation to the health  care of asylum seekers and refugees:   

  Health and Welfare of Asylum Seekers and Refugees   

  1. In addition to suffering the same health problems as the general population, asylum seekers and  refugees are at particular risk from a range of conditions including psychological disorders such as  post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and the physical effects of persecution and  torture.

  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  They may also often suffer the effects of poor dental hygiene, poor nutrition and diet,  and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, which may be more common in their countries of  origin.

  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9    

  

  2. To determine their specific health needs, all asylum seekers and refugees should undergo  comprehensive and timely health assessments in a culturally appropriate manner by suitably trained  medical practitioners as part of a primary health care team. This assessment will be used to establish  ongoing care.    

  3. All asylum seekers and refugees should have access to the same level of health care as all  Australian citizens. In addition, it should be ensured that their special needs, including cultural,  linguistic, and health-related, are addressed.    

  4. A national statutory body of clinical experts independent of governments should be established with  the power to investigate and advise regarding the health and welfare of asylum seekers and refugees.    

  5. All asylum seekers and refugees, independent of their citizenship or visa status, should have  universal access to basic health care, Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS),  counselling, education, and opportunities to seek employment, including access to appropriate  support and settlement services. Immigration policies that restrict the social and economic rights of  disadvantaged groups of people, such as asylum seekers and refugees, can have adverse impacts  on their health and wellbeing.

  Australian Medical Association Limited ABN 37 008 426 793 2       

  6. Health and welfare services for asylum seekers in detention and in the community should be  adequately resourced and integrated at State and Federal level. This includes staff education,  training, and support.   

  7. More research is needed into the health status and health care of asylum seekers and refugees,  both within the community and in detention facilities, to assist medical practitioners in the care of  these groups, and the development of appropriate services.     

  8. More research is needed into the impact of immigration controls, such as the prolonged,  indeterminate use of detention, on the health of asylum seekers, including those eventually  determined to be refugees.    

  Community Based Asylum Seekers and Refugees   

  Asylum seekers and refugees living in the community should have continued access to culturally  appropriate health care, including specialist care, to meet their ongoing health needs, including  rehabilitation. Continuity of care is particularly important for those released from detention facilities  into the general community.    

  Medical Practitioners   

  1. Medical practitioners should:  â¢ act in the best interests of the patient  â¢ not authorise or approve any physical punishment nor participate in any form of inhumane  treatment  â¢ provide medical treatment in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner.     

  2. Appropriate medical treatment teams should include members with the skills outlined above.  Medical practitioners providing full assessment of asylum seekers and refugees should be suitably  trained in:  â¢ identification of victims of torture and assessment and management of related trauma 

  â¢ responding to the medical, physical, emotional, and developmental needs of children and  families  â¢ recognising particular health-related conditions which may be more common in an asylum  seeker’s or refugee’s home country than here in Australia (eg. tuberculosis).    

  3. Medical practitioners should at all times insist that the rights of their patients be respected and not  allow lower standards of care to be provided. In particular, the right to privacy and confidentiality must  be protected.   

  4. Professional medical organisations should develop a set of ethical guidelines to support medical  practitioners working with asylum seekers and refugees in whatever context.    

  Issues Specific to Asylum Seekers   

  Asylum seekers are generally not afforded the same rights as refugees; thus, they are often not given  the same access to freedom of movement, to work, or to medical care. These restrictions can  potentially adversely affect their health and well-being, particularly their mental health. The specific  issues of immigration detention facilities and temporary protection visas are addressed below.       

  Immigration Detention Facilities   

  1. Prolonged, indeterminate detention of asylum seekers in immigration detention facilities violates  basic human rights and contributes adversely to health, particularly mental health. 4, 6, 9, 10, 11  Australia  must find an alternative solution to prolonged, indeterminate detention as a matter of urgency. In the  meantime, no-one should be held in detention beyond a minimal period of time.

  2. In order that asylum seekers do not spend a prolonged, indeterminate period of time in detention,  the Government must set in law an absolute maximum duration that an asylum seeker can spend in  detention. After such time, the asylum seeker should be allowed to live in the community while their  visa application continues to be assessed. The determination of an absolute maximum time that  asylum seekers can spend in detention must be undertaken with appropriate public consultation,  including relevant organisations.     

  3. Where immigration detention facilities continue to be used to detain asylum seekers, governments  must provide basic humane standards of living conditions.  They must strive to achieve world’s best  practice in all Australian detention facilities, whether located within Australia or offshore. This includes  accommodating the health, linguistic, cultural, social, educational, privacy, gender-specific and  religious needs of asylum seekers.    

  4. A separate independent authority whose processes are both transparent and accountable should  be responsible for the health and welfare of detainees.    

  5. The assessment of, and provision of medical care to, asylum seekers in detention must be  undertaken by medical practitioners.   

  6. Health screening should be undertaken by a medical practitioner or a nurse. Health screening for  addictive, physical, and psychiatric problems, including potential suicide risk, should occur on  admission to the facility. All significant medical findings should be referred immediately to a medical  practitioner.   

  7. Ongoing health status reviews must occur regularly.     

  8. The provision of health care is potentially constrained due to the physical and social environment of  detention centres, particularly those located ‘offshore’. Those in detention should have timely access  to good quality ongoing health care, including emergency and specialist services, to the same  standard as is available to Australian citizens. Those who require assessment or treatment that  cannot be undertaken within the detention centre environment should be transferred to an appropriate  facility in a timely manner.     

  9. Those in detention should have access to appropriate specialist services including obstetric and  gynaecological services, ante-natal and post-natal care, paediatric services, mental health,  rehabilitation, allied health services, and dental services.   

  10. Provision must be made for ongoing health care and social support services in the community  when an asylum seeker is released.     

  11. Individuals who are released into the community must have timely access to their medical records  from their time in detention. Those who are deported should receive a copy of their medical record  from their time in detention to take with them.    

  Children    

  1. Children are particularly vulnerable and the detention environment places enormous stress on  them.  

  Children often witness behavioural and psychological distress in adults, including their parents,  violence and self-harm, and experience separation from family members.  4, 9, 10, 12, 13   

  

  2. Children appear to be at particular risk of sexual violence.    

  3. An unaccompanied child should never be placed in detention.    

  4. An accompanied child should be kept in detention for the shortest possible time, but no more than  one month. By the end of one month, a suitable placement for the child with at least one adult family  member must be identified.

  Australian Medical Association Limited ABN 37 008 426 793 4       

  5. Children and their families should never be placed among the general detention centre community,  but should reside in a separate living area.    

  Hunger Strikers   

  1. The AMA believes that the detention centre environment should never become so intolerable that  asylum seekers would consider going on a hunger strike as a means of protesting about their living  conditions. Similarly, visa-processing procedures should be expedited to avoid self-harm due to  frustration.    

  2. Where an individual voluntarily refuses nourishment and is considered by a medical practitioner to  be capable of forming an unimpaired and rational judgement concerning the consequences of such a  voluntary refusal of nourishment, the practitioner should be free to refuse to co-operate in artificial  feeding. The decision as to the capacity of the individual to form such a judgement should be  confirmed by at least one other independent medical practitioner. The practitioners must explain to  the individual the consequences of refusal of nourishment.14     

  3. Doctors should become involved with the hunger strikers before, or immediately upon  commencement, of a hunger strike in order to continually assess the hunger striker’s physical and  mental health, counsel the hunger striker regarding the adverse health effects associated with going  on a hunger strike, and discuss with the hunger striker his/her wishes regarding artificial  nutrition/hydration should he/she lose decision-making capacity. Health staff should have free and  unfettered access to hunger strikers.   

  4. In accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration on Hunger Strikers (Declaration of  Malta), if the hunger striker loses decision-making capacity, the doctor must be free to make  treatment decisions that he/she considers to be in the best interests of that particular individual.    

  5. It is recognised that an individual who takes part in a group hunger strike may feel pressured by the  other participants to continue the strike, even if he/she does not want to continue. A hunger striker  must be allowed to withdraw from the hunger strike at any time, for any reason.    

  Temporary Protection Visas   

  1. The use of Temporary Protection Visas (TPVs) imposes undue stress and anxiety on individuals,  thereby undermining their ability to successfully integrate into the community.    

  2. TPV holders who are ineligible to apply for a permanent visa undergo stress and anxiety relevant to  the very impermanent nature of the TPV itself as they constantly live under fear that the visa will not  be renewed.    

  3. As TPV holders are unable to travel in and out of Australia, or access family reunion schemes, they  experience additional stress and anxiety through separation from family members.    

  4. The use of TPVs should cease.    

  5. All asylum seekers and refugees should be afforded equal Government support services, including  entitlement to family reunion and settlement services.
