 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 9 August 2013   

 All children must be released from  immigration detention   

 All 2000 children in immigration detention should be released immediately, the Australian Greens  have said.   

 "The government must commit to releasing all of the 2,000 children who are in detention around  Australia, and they must do it now," the Greens immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young.   

 "These children should never have been locked up and, rather than just talking about it, the  Minister should release them all immediately.   

 â€œIt is welcome news that, finally, the Minster seems to be willing to move on getting children out of  the Pontville Detention Centre.   

 "There are families in Tasmania who have offered to open up their homes to refugee children for  some time and the government should take them up on that offer immediately.   

 "The leadership of the Australian Greens on this issue, with a strong Tasmanian campaign led by  Christine Milne, Peter Whish Wilson and Anna Reynolds, means the community wants to see all  children release from detention.   

 "This government's obsession with cruelty has seen families and unaccompanied children locked  in detention and now they want to send them to tent-slums on remote Pacific islands.   

 "The Greens want to see Australia care for refugees and offer safer pathways to protection than a  leaky boat from Indonesia."
