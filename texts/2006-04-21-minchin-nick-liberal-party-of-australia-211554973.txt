Revenues and expenses do vary from month-to-month. Factors such as The New 7ii.x System, and the accrual framework including the timing of payments and policy decisions, can have a large impact on fiscal aggregates from one year to the next and on year-to-date outcomes. Further, the February 2006 monthly financial statements were produced under the Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (AEIFRS), with the exception that the Department of Defence is not yet reporting AELFRS compliant data for monthly reporting purposes and the Defence Materiel Organisation has partially adopted AEIFRS. The move to AEIFRS brings a number of changes including a new financial statement, the 'Statement of Changes in Equity'. 21 April 2006 Contact: Office of the Minister for Finance and Administration (02) 6277 7400 1 

  FISCAL OUTCOMES 

  Underlying Cash Balance  The main components of the underlying cash balance are cash from operations and cash movements in the  net investment in non-financial assets. 

  The underlying cash balance for the year to 28 February 2006 was a surplus of $4,946 million. This  underlying cash balance is $2,689 million lower than the February pro-rata (a surplus of $7,635 million) of  the 2005-06 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) estimate of $1 1,452 million. The difference  reflects a number of individual variations including the following: 

  Movements in underlying cash receipts: 

  Lower receipts from: 

  Taxation in line with the usual monthly fluctuations in taxation receipts. 

  Higher receipts from: 

  Dividends due to the receipt of the RBA dividend in August each year. 

  Movements in underlying cash payments: 

  Lower payments for: 

  0 Grants due to: 

  - The AusLink and Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements programmes. Pro-rata comparisons are not  necessarily a good indicator for these programmes as the level of expenses does not occur equally  each month but when the States and Local Governments make claims for payment; 

  - Underspends in a range of health related programmes;  Grants payments are lower than the pro-rata MYEFO mainly because negotiations with the States  over the detailed provisions of the funding agreements have taken longer than expected. 

  Lower demand than previously anticipated and milestone slippages for the following programmes:  Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment, Commercial Ready, Assistance to Mitsubishi,  Asia Pacific Space Centre, Hismelt, Ethanol Production and Biofuels; 

  - 

  - 

  - Personal Benefits due to lower than anticipated demand for Youth Allowance.  Suppliers, as Defence traditionally spends a higher proportion of its suppliers in the second six months  of the financial year, reflecting lead times to implement processes, and administrative lead times  associated with procurement. Some of the variance is due to slippages in contracting activity, invoicing 

  and payment processing, and some savings generated from the favourable currency exchange rate  difference, which will be returned to the government at the end of the year. 

  Foreign aid, specifically, AusAID’s three country and regional programmes (PNG & Pacific; East Asia;  and South Asia, Africa and Other) as well as the Emergency, Humanitarian and Refugee Aid and NGO,  Volunteer and Community programmes. These payments are not incurred on a pro rata basis, due to the  timing of activities, requirements of partner Governments and organisations, and the unpredictable  nature of expenditure on emergencies. 

  Employees, due to lower Army numbers, an under spend in Reserve salaries and lower than predicted  allowance payments. Ongoing recruitment problems in a tighter employment market also contribute to  the variance.

  IIigher payments for: 

  Grants, due to a number of education grants being expensed once a year around January being only  partially offset by an increase in grants payable. 

  Personal Benefits as personal benefits claimed through the tax system are typically higher in the first  half of the year as tax returns are lodged. 

  Fiscal Balance 

  The fiscal balance for the year to 28 February 2006 was a surplus of $3,843 million. The main components  of the fiscal balance are the GFS net operating balance, which was a surplus of $4,100 million, and a net  capital investment of $257 million for the year to 28 February 2006 (refer to the Reconciliation of the  Operating Result to Fiscal Balance on page 10 for flurther detail). 

  FINANCIAL, OUTCOMES  Actual expenses are $1,769 million higher when compared with a pro-rata of the MYEFO estimate. The  tnain reasons for the lower result, provided by function, are due to: 

  Education Function - higher grant expenses as education grants are expensed once a year in January. 

  Social Security and Welfare Function - higher personal benefits expenses which are typically higher in  the first half of the financial year as tax returns are lodged. 

  Partially offset by: 

  0 Transport Function - lower expenses mainly attributable to AusLink and other transport programmes as 

  the level of these expenses does not occur equally each month but when State and/or Local  Governments make claims for payment. 

  0 Defence Function - lower supplier expenses as traditionally a higher proportion of the suppliers budget  is used in the second six months of the financial year, reflecting lead times associated with procurement. 

  Health Function - lower grant expenses due to underspends in a range o f  health programmes.

  NOTES:  The accounting policies in this part are generally consistent with the requirements of AEIFRS. While the  scope for financial reporting recommended by AEIFRS and AAS 3 1 is the whole of government (that is, the  Australian Government public sector), the Financial Management and ,4ccountability Act 1997 requires  monthly financial statements to be consistent with the budget estimates. Accordingly and pursuant to the  Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998, this presentation covers the general government sector only. This  publication does not include full note disclosures. 

  With the introduction of Business Activity Statements and Instalment Activity Statements in 2000-2001,  taxpayers provide information on payments associated with several types of tax when lodging the statement  and paying the aggregate net tax amount. Thus, while total tax collections are known with certainty at the  end of each month, the distribution across the relevant heads of revenue cannot be finalised until all  statements are received and processed. The outcomes for some revenue items provided in this statement are  thus estimates, in accordance with the best judgement of the Taxation Commissioner, and subject to  revision. The taxation revenue items not affected are: Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, Excise duty, Customs  duty, Other Taxes and Individuals Refunds. 

  The sum of the revenue accrued in the month and the revisions to prior periods equals the revenue reported  in the Statement of Revenue and Expenses. 

  All taxation items in these notes are reported on an AEIFRS basis, unless otherwise indicated.

  NOTE 3: GOODS AND SERVICES TAX  In regard to GST revenue, AAS would suggest the gross amount of GST be included in the Australian  Government's Financial Statements. However, the clear policy intent of the Intergovernmental Agreement  on the Reform of Australian Government-State Financial Relations is that the GST is a State tax collected  by the Australian Government in an agency capacity. Therefore, accrued GST revenues and associated  payments to the States and Territories are not recognised in these statements. 

  GST Revenue (a)  (collected on behalf of the States) 

  * As pubkihed rn the 2005-06 M Y E F O   (a) GST revenue is presented rn this note on an accrual b a s s   which payments to the States and Territories are based  This differs from GST cash receipts, on

  NOTE 4: ADJUSTMENT FOR EDUCATION GRANT EXPENDITURE  In regard to education grant expenditure, adherence to AAS results in fewer education expenses being  reported until the signing of the Ministerial determination, which normally occurs between December and  February each year. This produces a bunching of expenses such that the full year's expense is recognised at  that time and remains relatively constant until June. The table below provides details of the cash paid by  DEST and attributable to the Education function for the year to date.
