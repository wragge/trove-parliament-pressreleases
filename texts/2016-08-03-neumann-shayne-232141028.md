 THE HON SHAYNE NEUMANN MP 

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR    

 TURNBULL GOVERNMENT MIA ON PNG RESETTLEMENT    

 The Turnbull Governmentâ€™s refusal to act following an order by the Papua New Guinea  Supreme Court to provide resettlement plans for more than 900 people being held on  Manus Island is deeply concerning.    

 This is the second ruling from the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court regarding  offshore processing which has gone unanswered by the Turnbull Government.    

 The complete disregard for the rulings raises serious concerns that the Turnbull  Government has no real plans for resettlement of refugees on Manus Island, leaving  people to languish in indefinite uncertainty and legal limbo.    

 What we have seen to date is a complete failure by the Turnbull Government to  negotiate resettlement arrangements with Papua New Guinea and secure third country  options.    

 Labor continues to call on the Turnbull Government to urgently secure a third country  arrangement that offers refugees a viable long term settlement future.    

 Peter Dutton must explain today what his plans are and when he will be arriving in Port  Moresby to deliver them.
