  MEDIA RELEASE 

  The Hon Bruce Billson MP  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs 

  AA 04 073 24 September 2004 

  Australia to assist Caribbean hurricane victims 

  Devastated communities throughout the Caribbean will receive immediate help from an Australian  Government emergency relief contribution of $200,000, Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs,  M r  Bruce Billson, announced today. 

  “Australia will fund the delivery of urgently needed food, water, sanitation, temporary shelter, and  logistical support, including transport and distribution, to victims of Humcanes Ivan and Jeanne,”  Mr Billson said. 

  “More than 1,000 people tragically have been killed by Hurricane Jeanne on the island of Haiti, and  with damage to more than 90 per cent of the country’s homes, thousands have been left homeless. 

  “Australia will provide $100,000 to CARE Australia in Haiti and $100,000 to the International  Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Appeal, for those affected by Hurricane Ivan in  other Caribbean countries. 

  “The appeal aims to assist more than 85,000 people over six months, now affected by extensive  flooding that has created the risk of diarrhoea and water borne diseases and caused a significant loss  of livestock and damage to crops and infrastructure. 

  “Haiti’s north-west has been particularly hard hit, especially the town of Gonaives where hundreds  of residents were forced to take refuge on rooftops. 

  “The area has been in severe drought over the past eighteen months and this week’s heavy rain has  further damaged ground cover, causing landslides in some parts. People who were already vulnerable  because of the drought are now in even greater need. 

  “In Grenada, about 60,000 people are in need of assistance and about 90 per cent of homes are  damaged, with water, electricity and telephone services having all been cut. 

  “The Australian Government is committed to responding to disasters in our region and further  abroad to help communities in desperate need,” Mr Billson said. 

  In 2004-2005, Australia increased funding by more than $13 million to $146 million for international  humanitarian, emergency and refugee programs.
