  Media Release

  The Hon. Philip Ruddock MP

  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

  

  ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MIGRATION REVIEW TRIBUNAL

  

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, 
Mr Philip Ruddock, today announced that Ms Susanne Tongue, previously 
the Principal Member of the Immigration Review Tribunal, is to act as 
the head of the new Migration Review Tribunal (MRT).

  

 Mr Ruddock said the MRT, which is due to start-up 
on 1 June 1999, represented a major streamlining and improvement of 
review opportunities for visa applicants.

  

 “This single tier, independent Tribunal will replace 
two separate stages of administrative review. It will substantially 
reduce processing times and ensure that applicants receive a quick decision 
on their case.

  

 “New hand-down procedures will ensure that applicants 
will more quickly and readily understand the decisions made on their 
applications:

  

 Mr Ruddock said Ms Tongue was the logical choice for 
the appointment,

  

 “Ms Tongue has a wealth of experience that she will 
be able to use in setting up and managing the transition to the MRT”. 
Ms Tongue has been the Principal Member of the Immigration Review Tribunal 
(IRT) since 9/1 0/95, and will act as Principal Member of the MRT until 
31/1/2000. Mr Ruddock said Mr Steve Karas, currently the Senior Member 
in the IRT Brisbane Registry, would act as Principal Member of the IRT.

  

 “Mr Karas, who has been with the IRT since October 
1989, will have a vital role to play in overseeing the arrangements 
for maintaining IRT productivity in the lead up to its closure on 31 
May 1999”.

  

 The Minister also announced that nine current part-time 
members of the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT), will take-up part-time 
membership of the IRT and that a further three new part-time members 
have been appointed to the tribunal. These additional members will help 
to minimise the number of IRT cases to be handed over to the MRT on 
its commencement.

  

 The nine cross-appointed part-time members include 
Ms Wendy Boddison, Ms Janet

 Duckmanton, Ms Kerry-Anne Hartman, Ms Norma Ford, 
Mr Andrew Jacovides, Ms

 Patricia Leehy, Ms Rosemary Mathlin, Ms Lily Mojsin 
and Ms Annemarie Nicholl.

  

 The three new part-time members are Mr Paul Wake, 
Ms Ellen Goodman and Ms Robin Hunt.

  

 Full MRT registries will be located in Sydney, Melbourne 
and Canberra, with a MRT presence in Perth and Brisbane.
