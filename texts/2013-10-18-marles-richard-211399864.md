 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  OPPOSITION SPOKESMAN ON IMMIGRATION    

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Marles calls for Manus Island details  

 18 October 2013 

 Opposition Spokesman on Immigration Richard Marles today called for the  Abbott Government to disclose details of an incident at the Manus Island  detention centre which resulted in the evacuation of workers. 

 Quizzed by journalists on reports from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre,  Immigration Minister Scott Morrison confirmed at his weekly briefing that staff  had been moved to safety. However, he would not be drawn on the detail,  dismissing it as a matter for the authorities of Papua New Guinea. 

 “This is just not good enough,” Mr Marles said. 

 “Any incident which leads to an evacuation of this type is of concern to the  Australian Government and therefore the Australian people.” 

 He said the sketchiness of information provided at the briefing reflected a  worrying trend of Government secrecy around asylum-seeker operations. 

 “Using the military to hide the facts of what is essentially a civilian issue  shows a degree of arrogance by the Abbott Government that should concern  us all,” he said.
