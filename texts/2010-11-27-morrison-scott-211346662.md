 Scott Morrison, MP  Shadow Minister for Productivity and Population  Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  Member for Cook 

 Three boats in two days creates longer wait   27/11/10  

 The third illegal boat arrival in just two days, this time with 40 people on board, will  push those waiting offshore for special humanitarian visas in desperate situations  further down the list, Shadow Minister for Productivity and Population & Shadow  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today.  

 “So far this year 125 illegal boats have arrived with 6,267 people on board, this  includes more than 100 new arrivals on three boats in the past 48 hours,” Mr Morrison  said.  

 “The record number of arrivals is crowding out our refugee and humanitarian  programme,” he said. 

 “Every boat that arrives means that more vulnerable people waiting in offshore camps  who have gone through the proper processes to obtain a visa to come to Australia  miss out.  

 “This is yet another damning indictment on this Labor Government under Julia  Gillard and Minister Bowen who have lost control of Australia’s immigration  program and borders. 

  “Three years ago you could count the number of people being detained who had  arrived illegally by boat on less than one hand, there were just four. That was the  legacy of the Coalition,” Mr Morrison said.
