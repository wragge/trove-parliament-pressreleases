 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Thursday, 5th December 2013   

 Greens bill will give Parliament the power to  decide visa freezes   

 The Australian Greens will give notice today of a bill to be introduced into the Senate that would  limit the power of the Immigration Minister by giving the Parliament the final say on visa caps and  freezes.   

 “The government is so obsessed with cruelty that it can’t be trusted with this level of power,” the  Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The freeze on protection visas, even for people who have already been found to be genuine  refugees, is an abuse of power and the Greens will work to rein that in.   

 “Putting a check on the Minister’s cruelty by allowing the Parliament to rule on visa caps and freezes  is a common sense step.”   

 The bill will be brought on for debate in the Senate next week and the Greens will urge the Labor  Party to support it, ensuring its passage through the Senate and giving the government a chance to  improve its poor track record on transparency and accountability by supporting it in the House.   

 “Scott Morrison’s protection visa freeze was announced during the government’s extraordinary  hissy-fit because it didn’t get its way in the Senate,” Senator Hanson-Young said.   

 “This thuggish government’s willingness to punish refugees to make a political point shows exactly  why the Greens’ bill is so important.   

 “In its arrogance, the government is trying to circumvent the Parliament. We’ve already seen the  government’s scant regard for the Australian people’s right to know and now it is refusing to  acknowledge the will of the Parliament they elected.”
