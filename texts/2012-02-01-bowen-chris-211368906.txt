 CHRIS BOWEN MP 

 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP 

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 1 February 2012 

 AUSTRALIA WELCOMES UNHCR VISIT   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, today announced the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees, AntÃ³nio Guterres, will visit Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane from  12-15 February.   

 During his official visit, Mr Guterres will meet with Mr Bowen, as well as government officials, non-governmental organisations and community groups, to discuss a range of issues affecting refugees  and asylum seekers.   

 The visit is a valuable opportunity for Australia to showcase its world leading refugee settlement  services and humanitarian program, Mr Bowen said.   

 “I am pleased to welcome Mr Guterres and show him firsthand the role Australia continues to play  in providing refugees with protection, resettling families in humanitarian need from around the  world,” Mr Bowen said.  

 “I am particularly looking forward to taking Mr Guterres to Fairfield High School in my electorate to  introduce him to participants in the school’s resettlement program for refugee students, parents  and the local community, which has been internationally recognised as world’s best practice.”  

 Mr Bowen said that he was honoured to have the opportunity to welcome the High Commissioner  to Australia after spending time with him at the 60th anniversary of the Refugees Convention event  in Geneva in December last year.  

 “I was pleased to be able to take the principal of Fairfield High School and two young Iraqi  refugees to Geneva as part of our official delegation to showcase their excellent settlement and  integration work,” Mr Bowen said.  

 “And, just as I was very proud to be able take the successes of Fairfield High School to the UNHCR,  it is an exceptional honour to have the UNHCR come to Fairfield.”  

 Mr Guterres will also address the Lowy Institute on emerging developments and trends in forced  displacement around the world, and the complex factors which cause people to flee their homes in  search of safety, security and protection.   

 As High Commissioner, Mr Guterres heads one of the world's foremost humanitarian organisations  with the UNHCR, twice winning the Nobel Peace Prize.   

 Mr Guterres last visited Australia in 2009, when he described Australia’s settlement services as  among the best in the world.   

 Australia has resettled more than 750,000 refugees since the end of World War II.
