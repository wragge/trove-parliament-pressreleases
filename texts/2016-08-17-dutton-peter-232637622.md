 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 17 August 2016   

 PEOPLE SMUGGLING BOAT RETURNED TO SRI LANKA   

 Australia has returned a group of Sri Lankan nationals to Sri Lanka yesterday after  recently intercepting a people smuggling venture.   

 Six Sri Lankans who were attempting to travel illegally to Australia were aboard the  vessel which was intercepted on an approach to Australia.   

 The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Peter Dutton said the Australian and  Sri Lankan Governments continue to work closely to stop the criminal activity of people  smugglers.   

 “Our Sri Lankan partners provided advice that this vessel might be targeting Australia so  we were ready and waiting to locate and detain the boat,” Mr Dutton said.   

 “We have worked cooperatively with Sri Lanka for several years now and since  Operation Sovereign Borders began in 2013 every Sri Lankan boat that has attempted  to come to Australia illegally, has failed.   

 “This return shows that there has not been, and will not be, any change to Australia’s  robust border protection policies.”     

 Mr Dutton said Australia would continue to work with Sri Lanka and other regional  partners to stop anyone who attempts to reach Australia illegally by boat.    

 “People should not believe people smugglers’ lies and risk their lives trying to get to  Australia in unsafe boats; they will be turned back and will have wasted their money.”
