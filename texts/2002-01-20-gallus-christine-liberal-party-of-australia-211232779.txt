 GALLUS REPRESENTS AUSTRALIA AT INTERNATIONAL DONORS MEETING ON AFGHANISTAN

 The Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Chris Gallus MP, will attend the International Conference on Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan in Tokyo 21-22 January 2002. Mrs Gallus will be addressing the meeting of international donor countries and agencies on behalf of the Australian Government.

 'The Australian Government is deeply concerned about the humanitarian conditions in southwest Asia and recognises the acute reconstruction needs in Afghanistan,' the Parliamentary Secretary said.

 'The conference will play a significant role in coordinating the international response to the crisis in Afghanistan. I will be urging the international community to work together to help the millions of displaced peoples and refugees currently living in neighbouring countries.'

 'I will also be announcing how Australia can further assist Afghanistan, in addition to the $23.3 million in assistance announced by Minister Downer last year,' Mrs Gallus said.

 Hosted by the Government of Japan, the International Conference on Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan will discuss a preliminary needs assessment prepared by the United Nations Development Programme, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

 Australia has committed a total of $23.3 million to meet needs in South West Asia since September 11. The World Food Programme, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organisation for Migration and the

 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs have already received funding from Australia for their programs to help the Afghan people. Australia has also provided support to the International Committee of the Red Cross and four Australian NGOs for programs meeting the critical humanitarian needs of displaced Afghans.
