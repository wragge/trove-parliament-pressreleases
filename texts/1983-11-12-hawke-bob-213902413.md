 THE DEPTH AND EXTENT OF AUSTRALIA'S PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ASEAN  COUNTRIES I S  THEREFORE CONSIDERABLE» AND FOR OUR PART WE ARE  COMMITTED TO BUILDING ON AND EXTENDING I T .

 I T  I S  A PARTNERSHIP WHICH HAS BEEN ASSIDUOUSLY DEVELOPED OVER MANY  YEARS AND HAS NOW REACHED THE POINT WHERE SUBSTANTIAL AUSTRALIAN AND  REGIONAL INTERESTS ARE INTIMATELY BOUND UP WITH I T S  CONTINUED  DEVELOPMENT. . ' â   :

 AUSTRALIA SHARES .WITH THE ASEAN COUNTRIES A STRONG SENSE OF THE NEED  TO MAINTAIN REGION PEACE AND S T A B I L I T Y .  .

 THE CAMBODIAN SI TU ATI ON I S  OBVIOUSLY THE GREATEST UNRESOLVED  SOURCE OF TENSION WI THI N THE REGION.

 HEREIN LI ES A Vb Ï  P A., i  A fc PARTICULAR DIFFICULTY WITH THE CAMBODIAN  RESISTANCE COAL11 JOU â   .

 KHMER ROUGE lNVOlVEMENT WITH THE. COALITION RENDERS RECOGNITION BY  AUSTRALIA IMPOSSIBLE.. IT SEEMS ;0 US THAT Ï ÎE APPARENT PREDOMINANCE  OF THE KHMER ROUGE WITHIN I T  - NOTWITHSTANDING THE COMMENDABLE  EFFORTS AND INTEGRITY' 0 !; BOTH PRINCE SIHANOUK AND SON SANN -  CARRIES  W1 y F 17 ·. HE un A C C Ep ' A 9i. F P O S S I B I L I T Y  OF THE IMPOSITION OF THE KHMER

 rouge i n Ca m b o d i a . ·

 RATHER WHA" I T  DOES IS TO POINT UP THE NEED FOR STEPPED UP EFFORTS  THAT WOULD AT ONCE SECURE VIETNAMESE WITHDRAWAL FOR CAMBODIA AND  ENSURE THAT THE KHMER ROUGE COULD NEVER AGAIN REIMPOSE THEMSELVES AS  THE 60VERNMEN": OF THAI COUNTRY.

 A POL ITICAL SETTLEMENT OF THE CAMBODIAN PROBLEM IS THE ONLY WAY  SUCH A RESULT CAN BE SECURED.

 ULTIMATELY SOME BASIS FOR DIALOGUE MAY EXIST WITHIN 'THE VARIOUS  PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD BY BOTH SIDES.

 FOR EXAMPLE, VIETNAM'S RECENT REFERENCE IN COVERSATION WITH  AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN MINISTER TO A POSSIBLE CONFERENCE ON CAMBODIA AS  A FUTURE DEVELOPMENT I N  I T S  CURRENT APPROACH AND THE APPEAL ISSUED BY  ASEAN FOREIGN MINISTERS IN SEPTEMBER, INCLUDING A CALL FOR AN 

 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE (NOT NECESSARILY UNDER UN AUSPICES) ON THE  RECONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION OF CAMBODIA TO FOLLOW VIETNAMESE  MILITARY WITHDRAWAL, ARE SUGGESTIVE OF NEW AND POSSIBLY PRODUCTIVE  LINES OF APPROACH. '

 THESE DEVELOPMENTS, COMING AS THEY DO AT THE. SAME TIME AS ASEAN  FOREIGN MINISTERS HAVE FORMED A WORKING GROUP OF OFFICIALS TO STUDY  HOW BEST.TO DEVELOP THE..PROPOSAL I N  THEIR 20 SEPTEMBER APPEAL, HOLD  SOME HOPE OF MOVEMENT, I F  NOT IMMEDIATELY,. CERTAINLY WITHIN THE  FORESEEABLE FUTURE. .

 I  SHOULD LIKE TO THINK AUSTRALIA'S I N I T I A T I V E  HAS CONTRIBUTED IN  PART TO THESE TENTATIVE MOVES.

 AUSTRALIA WILL CONTINUE TO DO WHAT I T  CAN, AS A COUNTRY WITH CL0SE  RELATIONS WITH THE ASEAN NATIONS, WITH THE UNITED STATES AND WITH  CHINA AND ENJOYING USEFUL LINKS WITH VIETNAM, TO PROVIDE WHATEVER  ASSISTANCE MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE TO THE PROCESS OF FINDING WAYS OF  ACHIEVING A DURABLE SETTLEMENT OF THE CAMBODIAN SITUATION .

 AS I N  THE PAST WE SHALL MAINTAIN THE CLOSEST CONSULTATION WITH, AND SEEK THE UNDERSTANDING OF, ASEAN.IN ANY STEPS WE MAY CONSIDER  I T  APPROPRIATE TO TAKE.

 A PARTICULARLY DISTRESSING FEATURE IN INDOCHINA HAS BEEN THE HUMAN  SUFFERING ASSOCIATED WITH THE REFUGEE MOVEMENTS CAUSE BY CONTINUING  CONFLICT WITHIN THE AREA.

 AUSTRALIA HAS RECEIVED MANY OF THESE UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE NOT ONLY  BECAUSE WE FELT I T  RIGHT AND HUMANE TO DO SO, BUT ALSO BECAUSE  WE HAVE RE SP ON SI BI LITI ES  AS A MEMBER OF THE REGION TO CONTRIBUTE  TO A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM WHICH HAS HAD I T  MAIN IMPACT IN 

 THAILAND. .

 OUR C O - O R E R A l I O N  I N  1 HE H U MA N I T A R I A N  AS S I S T A NC E  MADE NECESSARY BY  THE REFUGEE S I T U A T I O N  REFLECTS SOME OF THE MOST DE EP L Y- HE L D VALUES  OF OUR TWO S O C I E T I E S . '

 I N  T HI S WE HAVE BEEN MOTI VATED BY COMPASSI ON AND HUMA NI T ARI A N  CONCERN.  AUSTRAt - Î Î‘  HB CONTRI BUTED OVER A U S T R A L I A N  DOLLARS 5 0  M I L L I O N   FOR AS S I S T A NC E  I N  THE FORM OF CAMS.  FOOD A I D ,  A N D  PERSONNEL TO ;

 INDOCHINESE REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS SINCE 19 7 8;  MORE ON A PER  CAPITA BASIS THAN ANT OTHER COUNTRYM

 MUCH OF THIS ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE DIREC'ED TO  DISPLACED CAMBODIANS IN THE THAI/CAMBODIAN BORDER AREA·, WÎ¼ J. L. E SOME  HAS SEEN DIRECTED TO MEETING THE HUMANITARIAN NEEDS OF RETURNEES AND  O THERS INSIDE CAMBODIA . . .

 THE PROVISIONS OF SOME HUMANITARIAN AID IN SI DE  CAMBODIA HAS THE  EFFECT OF AMELIORATING THE CONDITION OF THE CAMBODIAN PEOPLE. I T   ALSO CREATES CONDITIONS WHICH REDUCE THE ECONOMIC INCENTIVE TO LEAVE  AND TO ENCOURAGE A MOVEMENT BY THE REFUGEES .IN THE BORDER AREA TO 

 RETURN HOME.

 I T  WILL BE EVIDENT THAT AUSTRALIA BRINGS AN INDEPENDENT CAREFULLY  CONSIDERED VIEWPOINT TO BEAR ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE REGION. THE  ASEAN COUNTRIES WOULD NOT REPSECT US I F  WE DID NOT APPROACH THE  CONDUCT OF OUR INT E RN A TI ON AL  RELATIONS IN SUCH A WAY, NOR WOULD WE  BE ENTITLED TO SUCH RESPECT.

 BUT, ON THE MAIN ISSUES OF P R IN C IP L E , THERE I S  FUNDAMENTAL AGREE­ MENT. IN TERMS OF GIVING EFFECT TO THESE PRINCIPLES THERE HAVE BEEN  SOME DIFFERENCES OF EMPHASIS, BUT SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE HAS TENDED TO  BE OVERSTATED. ,

 LET ME THEREFORE BE CLEAR AND SUITE UNEQUIVOCAL. . .

 AUSTRALIA I S  NOT MAKING SOME KIND OF CHOICE BETWEEN OUR TRADITIONAL  AND CLOSEST FRIENDS SUCH AS THAILAND AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF ASEAN  ON THE ON HAND, AND THE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM ON THE  OTHER. .

 RATHER, INSPIRED BY THE SAME HOPES AND CONCERNS AS OUR FRIENDS, WE  WANT:TO SEE PEACE IN THE REGION WHICH HAS TOO LONG BEEN CHARACTERISED  BY WARFARE, MISUNDERSTANDING AND OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE.

 THE DEEP, WIDE-RANGING RELATIONSHIP WHICH EXISTS BETWEN AUSTRALIA AND  ASEAN SHOULD PROVIDE THE FRAMEW0RK WITHIN WHICH WE CAN ADDRESS SUCH  INTERESTS AND CARRY FORWARD OUR SHARED REGIONAL CONCERNS AND  PREOCCUPATIONS. -

 DESPITE THE PROMINANCE THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN IN  SOME QUARTERS TO  PERCEIVED DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND THE ASEAN COUNTRIES, I  HAVE FELT CONFIDENT AT ALL TIMES ABOUT THE A B I L I T Y  OF THE LEADERS OF  OUR TWO COUNTRIES TO CLARIFY THESE ISSUES SO THAT THE FUNDAMENT- ALLY  STRONG AND FRIENDLY RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR NATIONS I S  NOT ONLY IN  QUESTION, BUT CONTINUES TO BE FUNDAMENTALLY STRENGTHENED.

 THE TALKS BILL HAYDEN AND I HAVE HAD WITH YOU MR PRIME MINISTER  AND WITH FOREIGN MINISTER SIDD HI HAVE CONFIRMED THIS EXPECTATION. - · â   . y

 TflE FRANKNESS AND UNDERSTANDING ACHIEVED BETEEN U£ ARE , I BELIEVE,   â¢ttJDi CAT IVE OF THE STRENGTH AND QUALITY OF' THE''AUSTRALIAN/THAI   RELATIONSHIP.
