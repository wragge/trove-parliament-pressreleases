 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE - PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 13TH DECEMBER 2001

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 Subjects: National Executive, Afghanistan, South Australian election, asylum                 seekers, job figures

 CREAN: Today the National Executive agreed on the review process for the Party.  This is another important step in the modernising of the Party which I have called for.  The terms of reference are broad.  They go to establishing benchmarks by which I want the Party under my leadership to be judged: its ability to attract quality candidates, its ability to get the widest possible input into the Party’s policy and its direction, the ability for the Party to open up its dialogue with groups in the community, the strategies to increase the primary vote, strategies that go to lifting the membership base of the Party and an examination of the internal processes of the Party.

 The Inquiry will be conducted by Bob Hawke and Neville Wran.  Both successful Labor Leaders.  Both Leaders that understood in their time, the importance and need to modernise parties which they then led.  It’s that direction that I want advice from them on now.  Submissions will be called and hearings will take place.  The inquirers, Bob and Neville, will have a reference group comprised of an executive committee of the National Executive.

 I look forward to the results from this Inquiry to the dialogue that will inevitably develop in the course of it.  The timetable that has been set is for us to have a report to us by the middle of next year.  I indicated when I spoke in here on the last occasion that I wanted the policy process of the Party to get moving quickly and we’ve announced that timetable.  Today we announce a timetable which commences work immediately on the review of the Party’s structure and its relationships.

 I notice that since we have been saying that we will conduct this Review, John Howard has been pressured to bring forward his review into the internal mechanisms of the Liberal Party.  But he’s not brought forward it now.  He’s simply brought it forward from the end of next year to the middle of next year. It’s around that time that I expect we will be reported to.

 2

 Let no-one believe that it’s only the Labor Party that has to consider its internal mechanisms and its organisational structures.  The Liberal Party has not looked at its internal mechanisms for decades.  It needs to and I urge you to be putting as much pressure on John Howard to conduct expeditiously his review, as you have been on me and my colleagues.

 JOURNALIST:  ….. what’s the process when this Report comes back?

 CREAN: The process will be that we would be expecting recommendations to come to us, which we would then take, if they required rules changes and I expect that there will be rules changes required, I would expect those to be debated at the appropriate Party forum.  But what we want is for this process to commence immediately.  For the dialogue to be engaged, for it to be an inclusive review and for sound recommendations to come forward to us.

 JOURNALIST: It comes back to National Executive, is that right?

 CREAN: The two people that have been charged will have a reference group that is of the National Executive.  The National Executive will have to make the decisions, subsequently, as to what Party forum is needed for any subsequent changes.

 JOURNALIST: If you put it to the existing Party forums, won’t you then have the existing 60:40 structure voting on whether or not to change it?  Is that what you’re proposing?

 CREAN: You’re expecting me to change the 60:40 rule without the authority of the Party Conference?  You see, you can’t just click your fingers and change these things.  There is a process by which our Party operates, just as the Liberal Party operates.  No person can unilaterally change a rule.  What we’re seeking here is recommendations for change and the Party is going to have to face up to that change.  And if that’s a difficult task then I’m prepared to pursue it.

 JOURNALIST: But would you see these, Mr Crean, being approved by the Party nationally, either the Executive or the Conference and then being imposed by intervention on the State Branches or do you see them going to the State Conferences and being approved that way?

 CREAN: No, I would see them going to the appropriate forums.  If we’re talking National Rules, it would go to the National Conference.  If we’re talking changes to State Rules, it would have to go to the State Conference.

 JOURNALIST: Yes but the 60:40 is State Rules aren’t they?

 CREAN: Well the 60:40 … it is a State Rule in certain States, not in every State.  So clearly … but what we would be looking for here is recommendations that have to be adopted by the appropriate Conference mechanism.

 3

 JOURNALIST: Which are the States that have or don’t have that rule?

 CREAN: Well the States that have the 60:40 rule are: Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales.  But I might say there are two steps here.  One is 60:40 for the purposes of pre-selections, which isn’t the case in NSW, there’s no 60:40 rule for pre-selections in NSW, it’s a full rank and file ballot, nor is it the case in Queensland where there is a college system, 70% local and 30% union - so the 60:40 applies to the 30%.  The 60:40 rule therefore, is 18%.  In the case of Victoria where you have 50:50 -50 from the Conference and 50 from the rank and file, the 60:40 applies to only one of those 50s.  So it’s 25%.  So I think that people, before they jump to conclusions as to how undemocratic they might think the Party is through the 60:40, rule ought to analyse what the rule actually does in the case of pre-selections.  There is another issue when it comes to policy formulation, but that, of course, is only in the State Branches.  The 60:40 mechanism does not translate in a National Conference policy setting, because it is not a universal rule through the National Conference.

 JOURNALIST:   …modernisation …are you confident  ….?

 CREAN: They were two of the most successful political leaders in this country’s history.  They were people that assumed the leadership of their Party at a time that required significant modernisation.  It was Bob Hawke that brought the consensus approach, demonstrated his leadership from his role in the trade union movement in bringing people together and modernised the Australian economy, together with Paul Keating.  The legacy of that consensus based drive for stronger economic growth and higher productivity is what’s delivered to this country today low interest rates and low inflation. Sadly, we’ve dropped the ball when it comes to productivity and why? Because this Government has embarked upon a path of division in the workplace not consensus.  I want to bring back that consensus, because I think it’s the under-pinner to getting productivity up in this country.  Neville Wran was one of the most successful leaders in the history of NSW.  He turned the tide in terms of Labor’s electoral defeats.  Neville Wran led the Labor Government in NSW which commenced the path back for Labor across the nation.  These are people that have understood the importance, both of bringing people together and of leading.  Now if they got the formula right then, we want to draw on that expertise in the contemporary context.  They will be working with those of us who have to make the call and the decisions today.  But we are drawing on proven performers.  People who have not only served their Party but their country.

 JOURNALIST: How confident are you that this will lead to fundamental change in the Labor Party structure?  And secondly will you put your leadership authority behind the recommendations that this Committee comes up with?

 CREAN: I believe that the modernisation that I called for and delivered in terms of my front bench and the Parliamentary Party, that needs

 4

 to be extended into the organisational structures of the Party.  I believe if we are to make ourselves attractive again to our base as well as more appealing to swinging voters, we have to move with the times and I will get behind any initiatives that put us in that direction.

 JOURNALIST: …(inaudible)…

 CREAN: I will be prepared to put submissions to this body.  I have some strong views and I will put them.

 JOURNALIST: Shouldn't you be driving it?

 CREAN: We have set up these two people to advise us.  There are different ways in which the drive and input can be achieved.  I see this as a dynamic.  I don't think that anyone, any one person or for that matter any two persons have all the answers but if you set up a structure of people with commitment, conviction, goodwill and a desire to support what I am calling for, that is the modernising of the Party.  I am sure that we will come up with some constructive suggestions.

 JOURNALIST: Could you share some of those initiatives?

 CREAN: No because I have said to my frontbench that I want these debates to be conducted internally.  I think that is the appropriate place for them to be conducted and I am not going to breach my own requirement of them.

 JOURNALIST: …( inaudible)…

 CREAN: Well that is up to the people conducting the inquiry.  It has got to suit their convenience but we will be asking them to advise on how submissions should be called for, timetables for it and leave it up to them.

 JOURNALIST: In terms of recruitment do you think that’s your number 1 priority listed in the terms of reference?  Would you like to see more candidates drawn from outside the Party?  Do you think some people see it as a closed shop and is that any reflection do you think that the candidates for the previous election weren't up to scratch?

 CREAN: I think that we as a Party always have to strive for the best quality candidates and I don't say that that is determined by what some people might call high flyers.  I think we have got to find the right balance between people who can make the contribution on national issues, those that can translate and lead in terms of their local communities, their local constituencies.  On the question of eligibility to stand, there are many people who are Labor supporters and adopt Labor values but are not members of the Party.  They can't be for all sorts of reasons, either their profession, you name it, a number of reasons.  I don't think those people should be disadvantaged because of that circumstance.  I think that we need to look at flexibility by which we can attract the best possible people.

 5

 JOURNALIST:  … candidate…?

 CREAN: Under the rules they would obviously have to join if they were going to stand for us but under rules at the moment some people aren't able to stand because they haven't got a qualifying period of membership within the Party previously.  You would expect them to stand, expect them to join if they are going to run under your banner.  I don't think that is an unreasonable expectation.

 JOURNALIST: So you would have to shorten the qualifying time?

 CREAN: Sure.

 JOURNALIST: What's the qualifying period?

 CREAN: Well it varies but it's up to two years in certain places but of course there is a capacity there to waive that rule.  You have seen it in the case of Cheryl Kernot.  You have seen it in the case of Mary Delahunty.  You have seen it in the case of other candidates in other States.  So it's not as if we don't have the flexibility but I think that we have got to look at making that flexibility more attractive if we want to draw the best possible candidates.

 JOURNALIST: …Queensland matter …?

 CREAN: The Queensland matter is being progressed today with final determination by the end of February.  I have proposed that rather than the rule that came from Queensland, which was based on a divisor of a membership fee, I have suggested that we should be looking to more fundamental principles that equate union affiliation to the Party on the same principles as if a union were conducting a ballot for its leadership under the AEC, the Australian Electoral Commission or in the case of the State unions, the relevant State electoral authority.  In other words, affiliation that was audited, affiliation that was a snapshot at a particular date in time.

 I think it’s fair to say that there is a view that that is a sensible way to proceed but there are organisational aspects associated with it that require further investigation.  That investigation will take place over the course of the next couple of months.

 JOURNALIST: …(inaudible)…

 CREAN: I think it's an important step in the direction of ensuring integrity and transparency.  Who can argue against us proposing an affiliation determination that’s the basis for the Australian Electoral Commission determining a union ballot?

 JOURNALIST: Were there dissenting views on this and was it put to a vote?

 6

 CREAN: The proposition that was carried today was carried unanimously.

 JOURNALIST: And does Premier Beattie support this?  Has he been consulted on this?

 CREAN: He has and I have spoken with him at length.

 JOURNALIST: And does he support the new, the change because I mean it’s …

 CREAN: He is not a member of the National Executive.  He is aware …

 JOURNALIST: But he put up the first one.

 CREAN: Yes he did and I have spoken to him about my proposal. He was interested to further consider my proposal.  The resolution today gives that option.

 JOURNALIST: The determination that was agreed to was that you would move in your direction and sort it all out by February?

 CREAN: Yes.

 JOURNALIST: Organisational aspects …investigated?

 CREAN: Well, at the moment the AEC doesn’t conduct union affiliation determinations.  It hasn’t got the power to do it.  I’m not suggesting it be given the power.  In other words, that the law be changed but what I am saying we have got to get in place mechanisms that would apply as if similar principles.

 JOURNALIST: Similar principle so what ...investigated though, that seems clear enough?

 CREAN: I am saying to you that this was a principle that I have put on the table in the course of only the last week.  People are attracted to it, they want to work through more of the detail and I’m happy for that to be the case.

 JOURNALIST: Can I clarify something that you said at your doorstop this morning?  You said that the apparent traitor David Hicks should be brought back to Australia to face Australian justice.  Is this because you would be concerned that if he went to America he could be executed?

 CREAN: No, I firmly believe that Australian citizens should be brought to justice in accordance with Australian law.  It’s a simple proposition

 7

 and what I urge today was that the Consular approaches be made to ensure that that course of action be realised.

 JOURNALIST: The Government says that he is more of a nature of a prisoner of war and that it is not a Consular matter but a security and intelligence matter which would also suggest that the Americans will have a very big say in what may happen to him.

 CREAN: I’m not arguing that there won’t be difficulties associated with the jurisdiction or who thinks they should have access to them.  I am simply saying that the Australian Government should be insisting on access and taking all steps necessary to bring him back here for justice in accordance with Australian law.

 JOURNALIST: Do you believe that because he was captured fighting on the other side to Australian troops that he is in fact a traitor?

 CREAN: I have had a security briefing on this and I am not at liberty to disclose what was passed on to me but I think it is fair to say that there is still a lot of factual material that needs to be gathered.  And rather than jump to judgement I think that we should get that information and maybe be in a position to answer those sorts of questions another time.  But the principle that I am talking of here is the requirement for Mr Hicks to be brought back here and to be dealt with in accordance with Australian law.

 JOURNALIST: Just in terms of the low primary vote that you have spoken about this review obviously won’t be conducted prior to the South Australia state election.  How concerned are you that that low primary vote for the ALP will be reflected at the state election in South Australia?

 CREAN: Well, I mean, the South Australian branch needs to conduct its campaign to maximise its vote.  It is not going to wait for any review to make that judgement, it is the policies, it’s the track record of the current Government and it is whenever the Government decides to call the election over there.  We will be doing everything possible to win the South Australian election but we are not going to hold up campaigning and strategic approaches based on this review and nor should we.

 JOURNALIST: …that this review be public or parts of it be public? Otherwise it could just be seen as a factional deal at the end of it all if it’s not.

 CREAN: Well the report itself, of course, will be made public.  It is up to those conducting the inquiry as to how they want to be proceeding…

 JOURNALIST: The process is important as well.

 8

 CREAN: The process is important but I think it’s also important to allow those people who have been good enough to undertake the inquiry to advise as to how they intend to conduct it.

 JOURNALIST: Aren’t you trying to generate confidence in the Labor Party in that part of it … the public can actually see how this happens?

 CREAN: The public will have the ability to see this process.  We want it to be a transparent exercise but importantly, you look at the terms of reference, we have got to investigate every means possible by which the Party gets the best possible input into its decision making process.

 JOURNALIST: How can it be transparent if the hearings are not public?

 CREAN: Of course it can.

 JOURNALIST: …analysis today that refugees the people characterised as refugees as queue jumpers and cheats…  Do you agree with Kofi Annan or with Philip Ruddock’s view of Australia’s immigration program?

 CREAN: I haven’t seen the comments of Kofi Annan.  I simply make the point: we need a lasting solution to the asylum seekers issue.  Philip Ruddock last week acknowledged that the “Pacific Solution” was not working. We have now got a Government it would appear from reports knew the full cost of the so-called “Pacific Solution” but never told the Australian public before the election.  I think the Government needs to come clean on what its strategy is and what the cost is.  But we need a lasting solution and I am prepared to be part of arriving at that lasting solution.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, are the two state reviews going to go on?

 CREAN: Yes they will go on, well as I understand they will go on Michelle.  Both Mr Wran and Mr Hawke have been asked to review into NSW and South Australia respectively.  Obviously there will be some areas of overlap but it is up to them as to how they conduct it.  When I have spoken with both of them and I have acknowledged the point itself it hasn’t been seen as a barrier to them.

 JOURNALIST: Queensland has also decided on an internal review on its federal performance.  Is there any danger of having too many reviews and too many recommendations?

 CREAN: You can never review enough.  I’m only interested in the outcomes.

 JOURNALIST: Jobs figures.

 9

 CREAN: Any, of course, any reduction in the unemployment rate is to be welcomed but I think you have got to look at what’s behind these figures.  The unemployment rate hasn’t come down because jobs have been created, it has come down because people have given up on looking for jobs. There were 4,000 jobs created in these monthly figures but 32,000 people gave up on work.  So for every job created eight people had given up.  Thank you.

 Ends.
