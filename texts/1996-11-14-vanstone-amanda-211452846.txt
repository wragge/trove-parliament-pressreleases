  FUNDING TO HELP YOUNG HOMELESS IN BRISBANE 

  V156/96 14 November 1996 

  Senator Amanda Vanstone, Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs today  announced a grant of$63,836 to the Mount Gravatt Training Centre for the establishment ofa Job  Placement, Employment and Training programme, JPET, a programme for young people who are  homeless or at risk of homelessness. 

  This funding is part of $22 million to be provided nationally over the next two years. 

  "The Mount Gravatt Training Centre is one of eight services funded as the first step in the nation-wide  re-establishment ofJPET", Senator Vanstone said. "The Federal Government has placed a high  priority on youth issues, and we are committed to providing assistance to young people who face  barriers so they can reach their full potential. 

  "In the lead up to the election the Coalition promised to re-establish the successful JPET programme  and provide $11 million a year in funding for the next two years. We are delivering on this promise  today. 

  "JPET will provide an individually targeted and flexible approach to assisting homeless young people.  Services are designed to help any young person who is homeless or at risk of becoming homeless,  with priority being given to those aged 15-19. 

  "Other at risk groups, such as refugees, ex offenders, wards of the State or those exiting wardship  may also get help from JPET. Th ,~y do not need to be homeless." 

  "A wide range of advice, support and referral services is offered to jobseekers to assist with  accommodation, finances, staying at school, training and employment, self esteem, family mediation,  drug and alcohol rehabilitation . 

  The Mr Gravatt JPET will tackle employment barriers faced by those who are at risk of long term  homelessness, unemployment & poverty. 

  It will provide flexible, accessible, holistic support and assistance to help clients gain accommodation,  income, counselling and life skills training, and enable disadvantaged young people gain employment  through individual case management that meets their diverse needs. 

  Local Federal Member Gary Hargrave MP said that he was pleased disadvantaged young people from  the Mt Gravatt area would be provided with a flexible, individualised service to help them get back on  track.
