 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 The Senate Select Committee on Ministerial Discretion in Migration Matters will hold its first 

 public hearing in Canberra tomorrow, 5 September 2003.  Details of the hearing are: 

 

 Friday, 5 September 

 9.00 am to 5.00 pm 

 Committee Room 2S1 

 Parliament House, Canberra 

 

 At tomorrow’s hearing, representatives of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and 

 Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) will be called on to explain the operation of the Minister’s 

 discretionary powers under the Migration Act 1958.  The Committee will also hear from  

 Ms Johanna Stratton, who last year produced a paper on the use of ministerial discretion in the 

 refugee determination process. 

 

 To date, the Committee has received 30 submissions from lawyers, refugee advocates and 

 academics working in the field, as well as relevant government agencies.  At public hearings 

 planned for Sydney on 22 and 23 September 2003, the Committee will hear some of their views on 

 the operation and appropriateness of the ministerial discretion powers within Australia’s migration 

 system.   

 

 Further information about the inquiry, the public hearing program, and copies of submissions are 

 available on the Committee’s website: www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/minmig_ctte/index.htm 

 or from the Committee Secretariat on 02 6277 3103.
