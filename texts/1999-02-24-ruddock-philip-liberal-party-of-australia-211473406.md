  Media Release

  Minister in Western Australia for   
immigration consultations

  

 MPS 34/99 

 A Malaysian pharmacist 
in Geraldton, an Indian midwife in the Pilbara, and a Canadian engineer 
in Kambalda are just three examples of Western Australia's success in 
attracting skilled migrants to regional areas of the State, the Minister 
for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today. 

 In Perth as part of 
national consultations on Australia's 1999-2000 migration program, Mr 
Ruddock said the number of migrants coming to Western Australia under 
the Skill stream increased by more than 40 per cent in 1997-98, accounting 
for over 50 per cent of the state's total migrant intake. 

 "By taking advantage 
of programs such as the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme (RSMS) the 
State is able to help meet demand for qualified professionals outside 
of metropolitan areas. 

 "The RSMS enables 
Australian employers in regional or low-growth areas to fill skilled 
permanent vacancies with overseas personnel if they cannot find suitably 
qualified workers in Australia. 

 "Many areas now 
have direct access to the Skill Matching Database where employers can 
instantly find details of potential applicants with the relevant skills 
and experience. This resource presents employers in regional Australia 
with a great opportunity to fill positions that would otherwise remain 
vacant. 

 "The 1997-98 Settler 
Arrivals statistical report highlights the positive impact this measure 
is having, with 4,966 people migrating to the state through the Skill 
stream last year, up from 3,524 in 1996-97. 

 "In total, some 
9,741 migrants settled in Western Australia in 1997-98 compared to 10,518 
the previous year. 

 Mr Ruddock said the 
Settler Arrivals report also showed that: 

  During this year's consultations Mr Ruddock will meet with a wide 
cross-sect ion of individuals and organisations including representatives 
of business, economic, industry, union, environment, welfare, planning, 
refugee, humanitarian and ethnic community groups. 

 Mr Ruddock will also 
host an open public meeting in Perth tonight in which any individual 
is able to attend and put their views on the size and composition of 
Australia's immigration program. 

 "Last year I hosted 
in Perth and Melbourne the first ever open meetings on Immigration. 

 "Those meetings 
proved so successful that I decided to extend them this year to include 
every capital city in Australia and several regional centres. 

  "This represents the first time a nation-wide round of public 
meetings has been held on the migration program." 

  Consultations and public meetings a re being held in Melbourne, 
Griffith, Sydney, Albury-Wodonga, Adelaide, Canberra, Brisbane, Cairns 
and Darwin Launceston and Hobart.
