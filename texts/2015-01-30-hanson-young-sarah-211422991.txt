 SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 30 January 2015   

 Manus refugees facing forced return to  danger   

 The PNG Prime Minister’s claims that the majority of the asylum seekers currently locked in the  Manus Island detention camp will be sent home are extremely concerning, the Australian  Greens have said.   

 “The PNG government is pre-empting the outcome of a floored and highly politicised refugee  determination process,” Senator Hanson-Young said.    

 “The asylum claims haven’t even been processed yet, but the PNG government has already  decided to deport these vulnerable people to danger in coming weeks. That would be a clear  breach of our humanitarian obligations, according to the UN, and it’s time the Abbott  government sat up and listened to the international condemnation.   

 “Prime Minister O’Neill’s comments are extremely concerning and just go to show that these  refugees should never have been sent to PNG in the first place.   

 “Forcefully returning refugees to danger is a potential death sentence and, if it is allowed to go  ahead, many lives will be lost.   

 “The Abbott government must bring these asylum seekers back to Australia, so their claims can  be assessed properly.”
