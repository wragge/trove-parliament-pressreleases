 the woodwork in the hope of finding fertile ground  for their inhumane and often ludicrous theories. They are rarely tolerated for long. In the meantime  I hope that their veiled threats are also empty 

 threats and that they will not resort to physical  violence against Asian Australians. It would be an  outrage against the majority of Australians who  support the humanitarian aspect of our immigration 

 and refugee policy.

 Sexism invades Ministers* Meeting

 On 10 September, Federal and State Ministers met in  Sydney to discuss immigration and ethnic issues.  Among other things, the Ministers discussed ways and  means to assist migrant women experiencing domestic  violence. According to observers of the conference,  before agreement could be reached that this is a 

 serious problem requiring a "flexible approach",  delegates indulged in an appalling display of sexism  during discussion of this matter. A Minister from  the Northern Territory, for example, reportedly 

 argued that Australian women at Women's Refuges  coaxed migrant women to leave their husbands and  families and to become radical feminists. He  suggested that all Women's Refuges should therefore  be closed. Reactions to this, apparently ranged  from embarrassed silence to nervous giggling, with  only the new Labor Minister from Victoria taking a  reasonable and progressive stance on this matter.

 No. 6, September 1982

 Editorial -Tax Avoidance also at the expense of  Ethnic Communities

 Over the past two weeks parliamentary debates  have centred around the findings of the Costigan  Report. There is no doubt that this Report has  exposed the greatest scandal that we have had in  Australia since Federation. During its seven 

 years in office, the Fraser Government has .   failed to take action against persons in  Australia who have been involved in tax avoid­ ance and evasion on a massive scale. Although  no Government representative has been prepared 

 to put a figure to the amount of taxation which  has not been paid, it is fairly clear that the  Australian people have been robbed of hundreds  of million dollars. .

 Ironically, this enormous loss of revenue to the  Australian people is revealed at a time when  public spending is at a very low ebb; at a time  when the Government preaches wage restraint to

 2

 lower income earners, when no solutions to rising  unemployment are being put forward, and when there  are cuts in social welfare services. Indeed, at a  time when ethnic communities, which had been  promised so much, find that the Government has not 

 given adequate backing to the programs it so readily  accepted since the tabling of the Galbally Review  and the AIMA Evaluation. Clearly the Government is  running the economy for the benefit of a few - its 

 rich friends - while ordinary Australians are  asked to tighten their belts.

 Furthermore, it has come to my notice that some  Government-appointed, great champions of the migrant  cause - people who claim to be working for equal  opportunity for migrant groups - have been named in  relation to tax evasion. With friends like that,  

 ethnic communities need no enemies.

 In the Federal Parliament ....

 Parliamentarians were busy with the problems of tax  avoidance, and debates on the Costigan Report pre­ dominated. However ...

 On 14 September, the Minister for Immigration and  Ethnic Affairs tabled the Evaluation of the Galbally  Report by the Australian Institute of Multicultural  Affairs.  The Summary is now available in 12 commu­ nity languages (Arabic, Croatian,  Dutch, German,  

 Greek,  Italian, Maltese, Polish, Serbian,  Spanish,  Turkish and Vietnamese).  .

 On 15 September, ALP Member for Bourke, Dr Andrew  Theophanous,  in an adjournment speech addressed him­ self to the Government’s crackdown on illegal  immigrants (see also below).  He made a strong case 

 against the techniques for the detection and

 7

 since the recent public meetings on multicultural-  .ism. They argue that the Australian people are  being "coerced" by the Government to accept multi­ cultural ism and that the Government is anti- 

 British, anti-European and pro-Asian. Their  Queensland publication, "News and Views", contains  a number of racist anecdotes, some amazing figures  referred to as "statistics" and, for people so 

 determinedly pro-British, their competence in the  "Queen's English" leaves much to be desired.   Furthermore a letter addressed to my office con­ tained what could only be described as a veiled  threat of violence: "Society will protect itself  even if the Government will not".

 The ideology of the Association is not only racist,   but also strongly anti-communist.  Consider the  following gem from "News and Views": "Known Commu­ nists have indicated that a non-homogeneous society 

 is easier to control than a homogeneous one.  To  this end they have actively promoted conditions  that must in the end lead to racial strife." Of  course, no reference is provided, but it must now  be assumed that the "reds" under Australian beds 

 include at least one Queensland Liberal M.P.

 They also cite the Prime Minister as having made a  statement that Australia will be taking 200,000  Vietnamese refugees per year.  Again no reference  is provided.  A Perth member of their organisation 

 also wrote to me stating, inter alia, that "most  white Australians live, in country towns and it is  principally the Asiatics that concentrate in the  cities".

 I have no doubt that the majority of the Australian  people realise the shaky ground on which the propos­ itions of this Association are based and that this  explains the lack of credibility afforded it. How­

 ever, it is sad that such anachronistic attitudes  will persist in our society. In the current economic  climate people with extreme beliefs do crawl out of

 A future Labor Government may, of course, feel that  '  an evaluation of the Australian Institute of Multi­ cultural Affairs is also required.

 No backpayments for Greek pensioners

 Senator Grimes, Shadow Minister for Social Security,  recently pointed to the Minister's (Senator Chaney)  "unpleasant sense of stubborness" in refusing to  authorise backpayments of invalid pensioners to ex­ pensioners returning from Greece.

 Over 100 pensioners in Athens had pensions cancelled  in April 1978 solely because a computer in Canberra  located pensioners in Greece who had attended  doctors charged in the now discredited "consipracy"  case.

 Senator Chaney has adopted a hard line against  natural justice for a group of pensioners who have  suffered undue poverty and distress. Instead of  making ill and poor returning pensioners go through 

 the trauma of appeals systems, we believe that the  Minister should give them the benefit of the doubt  and grant backpayments. However, Senator Chaney has  not yet taken the opportunity to redress a great  wrong, and ethnic communities will undoubtedly 

 remember his Government for this.

 Immigration Control Association - veiled threats and false information

 Although the Immigration Control Association claims  to have been formed in 1966, when changes were made  in the Immigration Act, they have become most vocal

 apprehension of illegal immigrants which are being  contemplated, namely the use of employers and  unions. Giving employers responsibility for  reporting on "illegals" is, in Dr Theophanous*  words, "extremely dangerous" because it means that 

 employers are able to intimidate all migrants,  whether legal or illegal. He concluded that, if  the Government was serious about cracking down on  illegal immigrants in the workforce, it should 

 increase the resources of the Department.

 Government crackdown on illegal immigrants

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  after a brief honeymoon period, has upset many in  the ethnic communities. The man who introduced  them to the concept of "Multiculturalism for All  Australians" and exuded goodwill at numerous public 

 meetings around the nation has become a target for  an angry ethnic press. What has brought about this  change of heart is the Minister's announcement that  the Government is planning a crackdown on illegal 

 immigrants. According to IL GLOBO, for example, he  is displaying "excessive zeal" in this endeavour,  other papers write of a. new "witch-hunt".

 There is, justifiably, little sympathy in the  Australian community for illegal immigrants. I  stated the nature and extent of this problem in my  last newsletter. Naturally, I feel quite strongly 

 that something must be done about this situation.  However, like my colleague Dr Theophanous, I do not  agree with the Minister's proposed method of.  tackling it. In particular, I reject the idea that  responsibility for reporting on "illegals" should 

 rest with employers, trade unions and workmates, as  the Minister suggests. This would have serious  implications for civil liberties. Issuing and

 controlling permits is clearly the responsibility  of the Department. "Policing” must not be passed on  to private individuals, as mass snooping and  victimisation would clearly result. Employers in .   particular could have vested interests, and 

 encourageing them to report to authorities could in  some cases lead also to the harrassment of  legitimate migrant workers.

 The Minister has linked the problem of illegal  workers to that of unemployment, which may be an  indication that the Government will attempt to make  "illegals" the scapegoats for Australia's current 

 employment crisis. Unemployment will not, of  course, be solved by deporting a few thousand  aliens, even if the Department could improve its  detection rate (at the moment about 1,000 per year 

 - 10% of the number the Government estimates come  into Australia every year).  If this crackdown on  illegal workers is the Government's sole contribu­ tion to eliminating unemployment, migrant  communities have cause to be angry.

 I have called on the Minister to consult with  ethnic communities regarding his proposed crackdown.  It would be disastrous if we had a repetition of the  so-called "Greek Conspiracy" operation, whereby all  members of the ethnic communities are made to feel 

 guilty for the sins of the few.

 Ethnic Communities' Councils of N.S.W, - Seminar on  ·  AIMA Evaluation

 On 18 September, the ECC of NSW conducted a seminar  on the evaluation of post arrival programs and  services. I congratulate them for taking this  initiative, as many people would regard this subject  a thorny one. Indication of this was given early

 5

 in the day when it was suggested that the AIMA  Evaluation "is a report based not on facts (as the  word 'evaluation' implies) but on political feasi­ bility in the current political and economic 

 climate". (Introduction to seminar papers.)

 Mr Peter Sheldrake, who represented the Australian  Institute of Multicultural Affairs, attempted to  rebut this accusation by pointing to provision  18(2) of the AIMA Act, which states that the  Minister is not empowered "to give directions to 

 the Council with respect to the content of any  report furnished ...". He emphasised that the  Institute is an independent authority and not a  political body. He also claimed that the audience 

 did not seem representative of ethnic communities  which, according to Mr Sheldrake, "have all gladly  embraced the Evaluation."

 However, many people at the seminar - and a number  of them represented grass-roots ethnic organisa­ tions, while others, were workers in the field -  remained unconvinced of Mr Sheldrake's protesta­ tions. Doubt was also cast over the Evaluation's 

 methodology and, consequently, its findings. The  AIMA report was, by many, assessed to be a "con­ servative document" and it was claimed that, as an  evaluation, it is "not only inadequate, but  misleading".

 Finally; and unfortunately after representatives of  the Minister and the Institute had left to catch  their various planes, a motion was put condemning  the Evaluation and calling on the Federal Government 

 to withdraw its acceptance of· it. The motion was  passed after some heated debate, and a number of  people left the meeting as a protest against the  motion; .

 Since we are told that the AIMA Evaluation is only  the first of a number of such documents, I hope  that the Government takes these criticisms on board.
