 Media Release    

 The Hon Christopher Pyne MP  Shadow Minister for Education, Apprenticeships and Training  Coalition Campaign Spokesman    

 Sunday 1 September 2013    

 Rudd offers no hope for the future    

 When you cut through all the blah, blah, blah from Kevin Rudd today, there was no plan for  Australia’s future.    

 As usual, it was all about Kevin.    

 If he is re-elected, the next three years will be just like the last six.    

 Kevin Rudd’s speech mentioned Tony Abbott 26 times and in one 360 word burst he  mentioned Tony Abbott 15 times, a clear sign that his relentlessly negative campaign didn’t  take a break for his launch.     

 Yet he:  â¢      failed to mention the carbon tax;  â¢      only mentioned Labor’s debt and deficit once;  â¢      made no mention of border security or the  50,000 boat  people who  have come 

 since he reversed the Howard Government’s successful policies;  â¢      failed to rule out a deal with the Greens or independents;  â¢      made no mention of rural and regional Australia;  â¢      made no mention of farms or farmers;  â¢      made no mention of defence;  â¢      totally  ignored  his  policy  thought  bubbles  including  his  Northern Australia, 

 moving Garden Island to Brisbane, or his Ministry of Cities thought bubbles; and  â¢      made no mention of the need for a strong, stable majority government.    

 Kevin Rudd continued his pathetic scare campaign about $70 billion of cuts to jobs,  education and health.  

 

 The fact is, there is no $70 billion black hole, this is totally discredited. There will be no cuts  to health or education and there will be no change to the GST.    

 Kevin Rudd offered no genuine apology for Labor’s failures over the last six years - not even  for misusing the Public Service last week.    

 Kevin Rudd’s speech leaves us no wiser about his plans for the future or how another three  years of Labor would be any different to the chaos of the last six.
