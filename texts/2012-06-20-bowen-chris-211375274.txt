 NEW SERVICES TO HELP MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES IN  ACT/NSW  

 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Multicultural Affairs,  Senator Kate Lundy, today announced four new projects in the ACT/NSW region will be funded next  financial year under the Settlement Grants Program (SGP) to assist newly arrived migrants and  refugees become self-reliant and successfully settle in Australia.    

 From 1 July 2012, ACT/NSW regional settlement agencies will receive a total of $188,439 in additional  funding to deliver new services that will assist humanitarian entrants and new migrants to acquire  skills and knowledge to fully participate in the community as soon as possible after arrival.     

 As part of the funding allocated to the region this coming financial year, the Riverina Community  College in Wagga Wagga will receive a grant to provide training in first aid, music, arts, sewing and  crafts to increase young people’s independence and knowledge of Australian culture.   

 “This project will help teach young migrants critical life skills and build self-reliance,” Mr Bowen said.    

 “The Queanbeyan Multilingual Centre has also been funded to assist new refugees develop  independence and to help them to navigate, and gain access to, mainstream settlement services in  the Goulburn, Queanbeyan and Eurobodalla regions.    

 “As part of this program people will be taught life skills and financial management strategies and will  be educated about employment and health issues.”   

 Announcing four ACT/NSW region grants, Senator Lundy said the Australian Government reaffirmed  its commitment to helping refugees and migrants settle into their new communities through the  Settlement Grants Program.   

 “These grants provide practical assistance to new arrivals, helping refugees on the right path make  the transition to their new life in Australia by developing their existing skills and building capacity,”  Senator Lundy said.   

 “The many services supported by the settlement grants program will help migrants and refugees to  settle successfully into their new communities, promoting social participation and assisting in their  cultural transition to Australia.   

 

 

 “The community sector plays a vital role in supporting the settlement of migrants and refugees and I  commend the successful organisations in the region for delivering practical assistance to help new  arrivals settle in Australia.”    

 The Australian Government will spend $39 million in 2012-13 to deliver services to humanitarian  entrants and new migrants to acquire skills and knowledge to fully participate in the community as  soon as possible after arrival.
