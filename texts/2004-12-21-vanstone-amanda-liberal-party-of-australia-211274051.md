 Senator Amanda Vanstone  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS  AFFAIRS

 Bakhtiyari

 VPS 149/2004

 Minister for Immigration Amanda Vanstone, said today she well understood the community interest in the Bakhtiyari family.

 ‘Advocacy groups, people and organisations involved with this family are focusing their energy and emotion towards this individual  case,’ the Minister said.

 ‘There will always be a clash however, when narrowly-focused emotion meets the broader perspective of the law and fairness to all  applicants, not just one case under discussion.

 ‘Decisions makers at the departmental level, within the Refugee Review Tribunal and me at the Ministerial level must assess any  individual case against the law and claims for protection by others in similar circumstances.

 ‘My heart and compassion at this time goes to people in refugee camps, who are desperately hoping for settlement in a country like  Australia. 

 ‘The priority of our Refugee and Humanitarian Program should be people most in need; for example, those waiting in refugee camps in  Africa.

 ‘It must be remembered in any discussion about the Bakhtiyari family that their claims for refugee status have been tested and re-tested,  including through 20 separate legal actions related to their claims.

 ‘The family has received more than a fair go and should now accept the outcome of the rigorous and exhaustive administrative and legal  processes.

 ‘I will not publicly canvass details of voluntary departure or removals in individual cases. I can confirm however that the family will  not be moved before Christmas.

 ‘Reports to the contrary are nothing more than a reflection of the misinformation and hearsay surrounding this case that is routinely  reported by some media outlets as fact.’
