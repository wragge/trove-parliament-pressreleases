 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 Michael Organ MP  Greens Member for Cunningham    

 29 August 2004 

 ELECTION IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY:  ORGAN   

 

 Cunningham MP Michael Organ says the election will be very close and a great  opportunity for the people of the Illawarra to confirm that they won’t be taken for  granted by the ALP or ignored by the Liberals again.     

 “Since my election in 2002 I have been a much needed voice for our community  both inside and outside parliament. I have championed workers rights, the  escarpment, public health care, welfare and education. My voice for the  community was long overdue," Michael Organ said.  

 

  “My election in 2002 showed that there is alternative to the sloppy duopoly of the  major parties.      

 “My re-election would be a message for whoever wins government to protect the  escarpment and the coast, for better public services, for a humane approach to  refugees and for the environment.”  

 

 “One thing is certain, Howard must be removed from the Lodge. He has ripped  up the social fabric of our community, he is a serial liar, he has tarnished our  reputation internationally and he is indifferent to poverty.”       

 “The best way to get rid of Howard and for the Illawarra not to be taken for  granted again is to return me to office,” Michael Organ said.
