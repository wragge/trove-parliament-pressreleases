 SENATOR PETER COOK DEPUTY LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE SHADOW MINISTER FOR TRADE

 MEDIA RELEASE 11 September 2001 - Burpengary, Queensland

 DON’T MENTION GST, JOBLESS, HEALTH & EDUCATION PROBLEMS TO THE `MINISTER FOR SCAMS’

 Employment Services Minister Mal Brough’s hysteria about refugees is no comfort to his electors faced with surging unemployment, a failing health care system and an unfair goods and services tax.

 While Mr Brough engages in a politically motivated smear campaign in which he is misleading people about Labor’s proposed solutions to people smuggling, the Labor Party - through its GST Inquiry conducted in Bongaree and Burpengary today (see separate release) - is the only political party bothering to listen to the electors of Longman.  What they are clearly telling us is that they want action on their real concerns - the negative impact of the GST, soaring local unemployment (13.1% - the 5th highest in Australia) and the crisis in our health, education and aged care systems.

 Of course, Mr Brough’s real problem is that he has no credibility in either of his two recent portfolio areas (Employment Services and as Parliamentary Secretary for Small Business).

 â¢ Liberal Party sources confirmed that the Longman branch of the Liberal Party, along with the branch associated with his Ministerial colleague, Mr Macfarlane, has been actively involved in GST tax avoidance.

 â¢ And under Mr Brough’s current mismanagement we have witnessed an extensive phantom jobs scam, which has seen the largest private member of Job Network inventing jobs to maximise their fees from the Government - a job scam Mr Brough’s own senior officials knew about long before he felt obliged by Labor’s pressure to take some action.

 The electors of Longman face a clear choice in the forthcoming federal election.  A bungling junior Minister who doesn’t believe he should pay his own government’s tax, or Stephen Beckett, a local Labor Party candidate who will address the real long-term concerns and needs of the people of Longman.
