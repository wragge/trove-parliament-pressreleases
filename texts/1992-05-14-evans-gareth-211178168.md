  Australia assists Burmese Rohingya refugees 

  Australia will provide $250,000 to assist Burmese Rohingya refugees in  Bangladesh, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Neal Blewett,  announced today. 

  "More than 200,000 Rohingyan people have fled Burma. Although refugee  repatriation agreements were signed in April by the Bangladeshi and Burmese  Governments, it is unlikely that repatriation will occur quickly," Dr Blewett said. 

  "Conditions in the refugee camps are grim with more than 80,000 people  without adequate shelter, food or medical treatment. 

  "With the monsoon season approaching it is essential that supplies be rushed to  the area before the situation worsens. 

  "Therefore we are allocating further emergency funds, additional to the  assistance worth $250,000 that we provided in February. 

  "Australian assistance will be channelled through Australian non government  organisations. 

  "It will be used to provide shelter materials, for shelter, latrine and well  construction, and for medicines, milk powder and clothing." 

  The following organisations will receive cash grants for work with Rohingya  refugees:  â¢ Adventist Development and Relief Agency - $100,000  â¢ Australian Council of Churches - $100,000 

  â¢ Archbishop of Sydney's Overseas Relief and Development Program -$50,000. 

  Australian emergency assistance for the Rohingya refugees is administered by  Australia's overseas aid agency, AIDAB.
