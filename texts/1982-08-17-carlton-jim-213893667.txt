 PRESS STATEMENT by the Federal Minister for Health 38/82

 NEW SYSTEM OF PATIENT CONTRIBUTION FOR  PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS

 More than one million Australians will benefit 

 from the introduction of new patient contribution arrangements 

 for pharmaceutical benefits.

 As announced in the Budget, a concession price 

 for benefit items will be introduced from 1 January next year 

 for people in special need and certain other .groups.

 The Minister for Health, Mr Jim Carlton, in giving 

 further details of the decision, said that at present the Pharma­

 ceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) operated a two-tier system of 

 patient contribution -- pharmaceuticals were provided free of 

 charge to eligible pensioners and their dependants, while all 

 other people paid $3.20 for each benefit item on a PBS pre­

 scription.

 The new arrangements, the Minister said, would 

 involve a three-tier system of contribution as follows:

 â¢ free of charge -- pensioners with Pensioner Health Bene­

 fits cards and sickness beneficiaries with Health Bene­

 fits cards, and the dependants of both groups, will 

 continue to receive benefits free of charge;

 â¢ $2 per benefit item —  people in special need who hold 

 Health Care cards, together with Social Service and 

 Veterans' Affairs pensioners who are not eligible for 

 a Pensioner Health Benefits or Health Benefits card, 

 and dependants of these groups, will pay a reduced con­

 tribution of $2 per benefit item;

 â¢ $4 per benefit item —  all other people will pay an in­

 creased contribution of $4 per benefit item.

 Mr Carlton said amendments to the National Health 

 Act would be introduced during the Budget Session of Parliament 

 to give effect to the changes.

 The Health Care card system -- first introduced 

 on 1 September 1981 with amendments to the health benefits arr­

 angements -- provides free bulk-billed medical care and free 

 public hospital accommodation and treatment to three groups of 

 people: .

 . migrants and refugees during their first six months in 

 Australia; -

 . people on unemployment and special benefits with incomes 

 below certain levels; and

 . other people with incomes below specified levels.

 ,  Mr Carlton said the new decision meant that people

 'in these groups, and their dependants, would be able to obtain 

 x their pharmaceutical benefits at half the cost to the general 

 public provided, of course, they had obtained Health Care cards 

 from the Department of Social Security.

 Some 1 270 000 people were currently eligible for 

 the new concession. -

 Mr Carlton said it was estimated that the patients 

 contribution changes would result in a net increase in Govern­

 ment spending in 1982-83 of about $2.8 million. ~
