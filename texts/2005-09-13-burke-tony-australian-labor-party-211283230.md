 Tony Burke, MP   Shadow Minister for Immigration   

 

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP:  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  CANBERRA  -       TUESDAY 13 SEPTEMBER 2005   

 ______________________________________________________________________ 

 Subject:  Valbona and Ergi Kola, Immigration Department, falsified documents  ______________________________________________________________________ 

 

 E&OE-PROOF ONLY   

 Tony Burke:  We had a guarantee from Minister Cobb in question time today that the  Australian Government agencies wouldn’t be involved in falsifying documents.  These  are the documents that the Minister guaranteed do not exist. [holding up documents]   You’ll see two people once with their own identities and secondly with the fake identities  that were given to them by the Department of Foreign Affairs on request from 

 Immigration.     

 You’ll see the bottom identities of the fake ones, on each case the people concerned, the  Kolas, refused to sign and the departmental official filled in the blank ‘unable to sign’.   The reason the Department did this is because Serbia will not accept back ethnic  Albanians who fled and sort asylum from Milosevic.  So unable to deport them to Serbia,  what the Government then did was return these people to false identification which the  Government knew was false- the Government had gone all the way to the Federal Court  against these individuals, against the Kolas, under the name the Kolas- knew exactly who  they were and yet decided when it suited the convenience of the Department of  Immigration, that it was better to give them knowingly false ID’s, giving them knowingly  false information and to change their names.   

 This is the sort of behaviour that you would expect from people smugglers.  This is not  good enough from the Department of Immigration.   

 The Department of Immigration is one of a number of departments that’s on the front line  of providing intelligence in the current national security issues.  They’re on the front line  of providing authentic, one hundred percent, accurate information.  And yet  what do we  get?  We get a Department of Immigration that’s quite happy to call Foreign Affairs and  say ‘please can you help us make it up?’ and that’s exactly what’s happened to Mr and  Mrs Kola. 

 

 Journalist:  Is there any precedence of this sort of thing happening?   

 Tony Burke:  I don’t know if this happening before.  I don’t know.  I certainly hope that  nothing like this has happened before, but you’ve got to say every couple of days now we 

 get a new scandal out of the Department of Immigration and yet even in that situation the  Minister still gets up today wanting to say “I’m one hundred percent confident that  Immigration wouldn’t behave that way.”  We are getting to expect less and less [from the 

 Department].  Up until now it’s largely been incompetence.  Today we discover it also  appears to be fraud.   

 Journalist:  Were there any ministerial directives involved in this case that you are aware  Mr Burke or was it done at a departmental level only?   

 Tony Burke:  All we know at the moment is the information which was obtained through  F.O.I where the signatures on the fake identities of the departmental official who claimed  to have known these two individuals under their false names for one year and five 

 months- that person’s signature appears to have been whited out on each of the  documents.  So exactly how high it goes up we have no way of finding out at the  moment.   

 

 Journalist:  Are you able to explain how you came in procession of these documents?   

 

 Tony Burke:  Yes.  These were provided to Marion Le under Freedom of Information.   

 Journalist:  If it does turn out that departmental officials were responsible for this without  the Minister’s knowledge would you like to see heads roll?   

 Tony Burke:  It’s too late for the Government to claim that the Minister isn’t responsible  for the behaviour of her department in Immigration.  Particularly when they are  continuing to be in denial the way Cobb was today.  So yes, any departmental official  who has been knowingly involved in fraud, heads would have to roll there.  But at the  same time there is no way Amanda Vanstone, once again, can get off scott-free when a  department is going to the extent of giving people false identities. 

 

 Journalist:  Why was the Department so determined to have the Kolas leave the country  (inaudible) context of this case?   

 Tony Burke:  In terms of the complete individual merit of the case, the only context I can  give is that they were determined in Albania by the UNHCR to have been genuine  refugees, we have those documents and they are available and the culture of the  Department of Immigration has been if there is any way you can deport someone then  you get on and do it.  That’s the way they behaved as we know even in the case of an  Australian citizen.  In this case they wanted to deport them, they weren’t able to under  their true identity so they tried to under a false identity.   

 Journalist: But they weren’t able to.  DFAT in fact rescinded the false documents, do you  know why that happened?, what changed?   

 Tony Burke: We didn’t know they had been rescinded until the FOI information came  back.  I want to find out the dates to see whether or not the only reason those documents  were subsequently rescinded was because FOI was causing people to find out about it.     

 Journalist:  Is this illegal ….( inaudible)   

 Tony Burke:  I can’t quote the section of the Act but I’ve got to say I can’t imagine that it  is legal in any way for someone to sign a declaration saying they have known somebody  for one year and five months under a name which is not theirs.   

 

 Journalist:  But they did travel to Australia on that name?   

 Tony Burke:  That’s right and it was recognised as being false.  The Department of  Immigration took them to the Federal Court under the name the Kolas.  It was accepted  that they were Mr and Mrs Kola.  In Serbia up-to-date photographs are attached to birth  certificates.  We know that they were the Kolas.  When the second set of identity  documents were sought they knew that they were inaccurate.     

 Journalist: inaudible   

 Tony Burke:  They are both in South Australia.  My understanding is that Mr Kola is  inside Baxter and Mrs Kola is in the community in Adelaide.  That’s my understanding as  to where they are at the moment.   

 Journalist:  inaudible   

 Tony Burke:  I am not sure of the exact status of the visa.   

 End
