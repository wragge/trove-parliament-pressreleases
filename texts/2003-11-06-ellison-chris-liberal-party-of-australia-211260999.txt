 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP   

 SENATOR THE HON. CHRIS ELLISON  MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CUSTOMS   

 THURSDAY, 6 NOVEMBER 2003  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 

 ELLISON:  A significant seizure by Australian Federal Police and Australian Customs  Service in stopping 195 kg of ecstasy reaching the streets of Australian cities.  860,000 tablets  will not be reaching the streets of Australian cities and, of course, you realise the significance  of this seizure when you look at the value, which is estimated at $60 million.  This was a very  good operation by law enforcement in Australia working with the Belgian Police.  As a result  of this operation two Belgian nationals, one Dutch national and three Australian nationals  have been arrested.  They have been refused bail in Sydney and they are now facing very  serious charges which upon conviction carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.  In  Belgium, five people have been arrested and we believe that this now has broken up a  Belgium-based syndicate allegedly trafficking in large amounts of illicit drugs.  This sends a  very clear message to anyone who wants to bring illicit drugs into Australia that they will be  caught and, of course, they will face very serious penalties.  Very good work by the  Australian Federal Police and Australian Customs Service working with the Belgian  authorities in stopping what is a sophisticated attempt to bring into Australia 195 kg of  ecstasy or the equivalent of 860,000 tablets of ecstasy which will not be reaching the streets of  our cities across Australia.   

 REPORTER:  Senator, what’s the intelligence about how long this syndicate might have been  using or operating in Australia?   

 ELLISON:  This has been a longstanding operation and, of course, has involved visits to  Australia by people from Belgium and we’ve also had Belgian police come to Australia in  relation to this operation.  So it’s been very much an international effort involving Australian  Federal Police, Belgian Police and Australian Customs Service.  It serves again to indicate  how important it is for us to have these international relationships with overseas law  enforcement and of course, the Australian Federal Police has a very good network of officers  overseas.   

 REPORTER:  What do you know of how the drugs were smuggled in?   

 ELLISON:  It was a sophisticated attempt.  The drugs were allegedly concealed in piping  used for agricultural irrigation.  As a result of inspection by x-ray equipment, an ion scope  and cutting devices the drug was found and seized and, of course, we’ve now arrested three  foreign nationals, three Australians and they’re facing the courts in Sydney.   

 REPORTER:  What do you know about how the arrests were made?  Where they targeted?   Did they go to their houses, or…?   

 ELLISON:  It certainly did involve a covert operation and it was as a result of intelligence  received from overseas.  The Australian Federal Police worked closely with Belgian  authorities and, of course, there have been five arrests in Belgium.  It demonstrates the  significance of international cooperation when you’re dealing with these drug trafficking 

 syndicates but I can’t go further into the detail than that.  It’s operational, of course, we now  have six people before the courts in Australia and they’re facing very serious charges.   

 REPORTER:  When you said that it was a, could be an international ring, do you think they’ll  start targeting other countries as well?   

 ELLISON:  Well, the Australian Federal Police is continually working with overseas law  enforcement and that’s why we have increased the presence of Australian Federal Police  officers overseas.  We have a presence in over 25 countries and that has served to provide us  with intelligence relating not only to drugs but people smuggling, trafficking and other  transnational crime but it demonstrates the extent that people will go to to bring illicit drugs 

 into Australia but also serves to remind us that we have an excellent police force in the  Australian Federal Police, Australian Customs Service and sending a very clear message to  people who want to bring illicit drugs into Australia that they’ll be caught.   

 REPORTER:  How likely is it that this syndicate was previously able to move huge amounts  of ecstasy into Australia?  I mean, do you know for a fact this was their first ever shipment  into Australia?   

 ELLISON:  Investigations are continuing and, of course, this syndicate has been under  surveillance for some time and it has involved extensive work by the Australian Federal  Police working with the Belgian Police.  I can’t comment further than that.  Investigations, of  course, are continuing and that is an operational matter.   

 REPORTER:  On another subject, Minister, what’s the latest on the whereabouts of the boat  that tried to dock at Melville Island earlier this week?   

 ELLISON:  The Minasa Bone, an Indonesian-flagged vessel, is now, has now been secured  off the Melville Island and, of course, we have Navy, Customs, Federal Police and  Immigration officials present.  We have the HMAS Geelong alongside along with a Customs  vessel and the Australian Federal Police are conducting their usual enquiries.  The situation 

 has been secured and as to what happens from here, that’s an operational matter which I can’t  comment on.   

 REPORTER:  So you can’t tell us where the passengers might be headed to?   

 ELLISON:  Well, certainly the passengers and crew are still on the Indonesian vessel and  Australian Federal Police are conducting their usual enquiries but, of course, there’s been a  very swift response from Australian Federal Police, Customs, Navy and Immigration and  demonstrates, yet again, the great cooperation that we have between our authorities in these  matters.  We’re grateful to the community and their cooperation on Melville Island.  They  certainly didn’t want these people landing there and they’ve indicated that and they’ve  supported the excision of Melville Island and I think that’s a significant aspect to this.  The  excision of this island and others, of course, is a key part of our border strategy.  Something  which Labor and the Democrats have not supported and have actively worked to undermine.   We have a multi-tiered approach to border protection in this country and that is part of it.
