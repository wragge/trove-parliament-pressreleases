 Michael Keenan 

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs 

 LABOR SEES IN THE NEW YEAR WITH 69TH ARRIVAL   

 Friday, 1 January 2010  The Rudd Labor Government has seen out 2009 in fitting style - with the  arrival of the fifth boat since Christmas.    

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs Michael Keenan said that while  revellers were out celebrating the end of the decade, 62 unauthorised  arrivals entered Australian waters last night.  

 

 "The Rudd Government will be hoping to put 2009 behind them, but what  they should be worried about is what lies ahead," said Mr Keenan.    

 "At this rate, 2010 is going to be a boom year for people smugglers."    

 Yesterday evening Customs Border Protection Command (BPC)  intercepted the 69th illegal boat to arrive since the Rudd Labor  Government weakened our border protection system in August 2008.  

 

 HMAS BROOME, operating under the control of Border Protection  Command, intercepted the vessel at approximately 10.53pm (AEDST)  approximately 22 nautical miles north of Ashmore Islands.    

 Initial indications suggest there are 58 passengers and 4 crew on board  the vessel.    

 "Under the former Coalition government's tough border protection  regime, only 15 boats arrived over a period of 5 years from 2002-2007,"  Mr Keenan said.    

 "It's now a new year, but we're still without effective border protection.    

 "It appears 2010 will be no different."
