 Senator Bob Brown   Senator for Tasmania    

 Kurdish ban vote lost 

 Senator Brown, Thursday, 17 August 2006   

 The Greens' disallowance motion to overturn Attorney-General Ruddock's  proscription of the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) was voted down in the Senate  today. Coalition and Labor opposed the disallowance.    

 "The evidence is that the PKK poses absolutely no threat to Australia. There has been  a bloody confrontation between the PKK and Turkish government forces but no act of  self-determination for the Kurds. The Greens back the position of Norway in fostering  a peaceful resolution of the conflict rather than proscribing one side," Senator Brown  said.    

 "This prospcription has sent a shudder of concern amongst Australians of Kurdish  origin, especially those who have been given refugee status here precisely because  they supported the PKK and had to flee the region," Senator Brown said.
