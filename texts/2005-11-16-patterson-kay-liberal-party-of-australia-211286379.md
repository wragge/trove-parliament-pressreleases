 $300,000 for migrant parenting project

 16/11/2005

 The Howard Government will deliver $300,000 in funding to the Migrant Information  Centre to help recently arrived migrants and refugees living in Melbourne's east with  their parenting needs and managing their family relationships. 

 The Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Kay Patterson, today  launched the Eastern Melbourne Parenting and Relationships Skills for Multicultural  Families project at the centre's Mitcham office.

 "This project will help families from diverse cultural backgrounds, particularly refugee  families and Chinese-speaking families who have settled in eastern Melbourne in the  past five years," Senator Patterson said.

 "It will assist with developing their parenting skills and build stronger family  relationships through participation in parenting groups, relationship education and  family counselling.

 "Families who are new to Australian society face particular challenges as they try to  span two cultures. Under the project, parenting groups will be established across five  different community groups, including Sudanese, Burmese, Afghan, Iranian and  Chinese families. 

 "Volunteers from these communities will be trained in group leadership, parent and  relationship education, supporting families dealing with cultural change.

 "A Family Worker has been employed to run the project and to link the families with  existing local service providers who can further assist them with parenting skills and  maintaining family relationships across their traditional culture while adjusting to  Australia's way of life.

 "The three-year project is a Local Answers initiative under the Howard Government's  $490 million Stronger Families and Communities Strategy, which supports local  initiatives to help families, children and communities. 

 "This project will support and assist newly arrived migrants and refugees adjust to a  new life in Australia and connect with their local community," Senator Patterson said.
