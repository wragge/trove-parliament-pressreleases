 Migrant Employment Fund cuts cruel and heartless: Greens   

 Greens Senator and spokesperson on multiculturalism Richard Di Natale has slammed the  Abbott government for cutting the Migrant Communities Employment Fund.   

 The $6.6 million Migrant Communities Employment Fund was established by the previous  government after a community campaign and lobbying by the Greens to support  employment programs amongst new migrant communities.   

 “This is a mean spirited cut, that will have little impact on the Budget bottom line but will  hurt migrant Australians who face big challenges in labour market,” said Senator Di Natale.   

 “Unemployment and underemployment is very high in many migrant communities. With  national unemployment set to grow this decision will make the job of the many community  organisations working with newly arrived migrants and refugees even harder.   

 “This is a particularly hard blow to the African Australian community in Melbourne who led  the push to establish the fund and worked tirelessly to get it established.   

 “This is further evidence that Tony Abbott’s commitment to multiculturalism is hollow. The  Greens will fight to have the fund reinstated.”
