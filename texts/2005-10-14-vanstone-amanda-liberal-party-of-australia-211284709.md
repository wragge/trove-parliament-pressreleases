 Update on Nauru 

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, today  announced that 25 of the 27 people remaining in the Offshore Processing Centre (OPC) on  Nauru will be brought to Australia. Some will initially be placed in detention. 

 ‘As part of the Government’s constant review of the failed asylum seeker caseload, both in  Australia and offshore, and as a result of updated country information from the UNHCR and  other sources, 13 of these people have been determined to be refugees,’ the Minister said. 

 ‘A further 12 people, who have been found not to be in need of protection, will also be  brought to Australia on a temporary basis to allow their long-term situation to be resolved  from here. 

 ‘This is consistent with the Government’s flexible approach to managing complex caseloads. 

 ‘The remaining two people at the OPC have received adverse security assessments and will  therefore remain on Nauru. Their long-term situation will be resolved from Nauru.’ 

 Senator Vanstone said that the Pacific Strategy was a vital part of the Government's success  in stemming the flow of unauthorised arrivals to Australia. 

 ‘Of the over 1500 people transferred to Offshore Processing Centres in 2001, successful  resolution of all but the current 27 people on Nauru was achieved either through voluntary  returns of those found not to be refugees or through determinations which found them to be  refugees and subsequent international resettlement to Australia and a number of other  countries ,’ the Minister said. 

 ‘The Offshore Processing Centre will remain available to deal with future cases if the need  arises.’
