 New Tribunal Members Help Reduce Cases Before MRT and  RRT

 MPS 42/2003

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today, the appointment of 36  new members to the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT), will significantly boost  members and help reduce the number of current cases before both tribunals. 

 The new three-year appointments will see the membership of both the MRT and the RRT boosted by 18. The MRT will rise  from 52 to 70 members, while the RRT will jump from 63 to 81. See list of appointees below for the MRT and RRT. 

 The new MRT appointments include one full-time position and 17 part-time positions. With the new additions, the MRT  membership now consists of nine full-time and 56 part-time members, four senior members and the principal member.

 New appointments to the RRT include two full-time and 16 part-time members. The RRT now has 33 full-time and 42 part-time members, a principal member, deputy principal member and four senior members. 

 The MRT provides independent merits review of general migration decisions made by the Department of Immigration and  Multicultural Affairs (DIMIA), while the RRT is responsible for providing independent merits review of DIMIA decisions to  refuse or cancel protection visas. 

 'The new appointments follow an extensive nation-wide recruitment campaign held in two rounds in November 2002 and  February 2003,' the Minister said. 

 Around 500 applications were received and considered by a Selection Advisory Committee, which comprised, the First  Assistant Secretary, Parliamentary and Legal Division, Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs,  Principal Member, Migration Review Tribunal and Principal Member, Refugee Review Tribunal; and a former RRT member,  and now Director of Teacher Recruitment International, New South Wales. 

 'This Committee interviewed 90 of those applicants and assessed them against selection criteria which were designed to  identify people with analytical and research skills, interpersonal skills (including sensitivity to cross-cultural issues), the  ability to make quality decisions in a timely manner and a sound understanding of relevant law,' the Minister said.

 'The new members appointed today have impressive credentials and come from a broad cross-section of the community,  representing a variety of professions. Whilst the vast majority are lawyers, new members also come from academe, health and  allied professions as well as business and community leaders,' the Minister added. 

 The Minister also announced the appointment of Ms Kim Rosser as a senior member of the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT).  Ms Rosser has been a full-time member of the RRT since 1997, and prior to this held positions in the Administrative Appeals  Tribunal (AAT) and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC).
