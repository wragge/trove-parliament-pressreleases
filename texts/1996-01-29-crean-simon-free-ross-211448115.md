  YOUNG AUSTRALIA: MORE HELP, WIDER CHOICE 

  "The Federal Government's Youth Statement, Young Australia , will ensure that young  people win their share of the new jobs to be created into the next Century," the Minister  for Employment, Education and Training Simon Crean, and the Minister for Schools,  Vocational Education and Training, Ross Free, said today. 

  Structural changes in the economy over the past decade have dramatically changed  young peoples' experience in employment, education and training . 

  In 1983, nearly half of Australia's young people left school before completing Year 12.  They mo ved into the labour force, mostly into low-paid, unskilled jobs requiring little or  no formal training . 

  Today, full-time study is the most common actiyjty for two in every three young people,  and the supply of low-skilled, low-paid jobs has dropped significantly. 

  Young Australia recognises and responds to these changes. It is about offering young  Australians more help and wider choice. 

  At its core is a refusal to accept the proposition that unemployment is an acceptable  option for young people. 

  It recognises that the best start we can give young Australians is education and training  that links directly to the new jobs in our growing higher skilled occupations and in our  dynamic high growth industries . 

  We will maintain the massive increase in numbers of places at universities and in  vocational education and training to give all young Australians the widest possible  range of options for education, training and careers. 

  Young Australia include initiatives in the areas highlighted as important in the recent  detailed consultations we have undertaken with young people and their representative  groups. These include: 

   " A transformation of the school to work transition into one where work becomes part  of our schools and where training is a fundamental part of the workplace. This will  ensure that young people have the widest range of choice possible in moving from  school to work. 

   " A wider range of options to encourage employers to train and employ young people.

   " A Youth Enterprise Strategy to encourage youth to help create their own enterprise  opportunities. 

   " More help for disadvantaged young people, including extended post-placement  assistance, 100 per cent wage subsidies for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.  trainees and int~nsive case management for homeless and refugee young people. 

   " Measures to ensure that young people have a more effective voice in communicating  their views to government. 

  Initiatives included under each of these areas, which draw substantially on the Working  Nation program, involve expenditure of$209 million to 1999-2000. 

  Specific measures include: 

   " an e-ightfold expansion ofthe Jobs Pathway Guarantee to 12,000 places in 1997-98;   " a trebling of the Working Nation target for school student work placements-to  15,000 in 1996; 

   " expansion of Australian Public Service recruitment of trainees from 2,500 to 4,000 in  1996-97; 

   " more flexible arrangements to enable businesses and State and local governments to  in~e their employment of trainees; 

   " Area Consultative Committees to target a minimum of25,000 traineeship vacancies  â‘in their Jobs Drives over the next six months; 

   " over 1,000 young people to be helped to establish viable employment ventures in  1996-97; and 

   " 20,000 entry level training opportunities in the environment 

  "Taken together, the initiatives contained in YoZDZg Australia will ensure that by the tum  of the century every 15 to 19 year old will have the opportunity to be in education or â‘  training or in employment,,., Mr Crean said. "We will be within reach of a target of no  more than 5 per cent of our young people being unemployed and looking for full time  work."
