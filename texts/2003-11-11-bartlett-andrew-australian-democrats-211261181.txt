 Senator Andrew Bartlett   Leader of the Australian Democrats  November 11, 2003               MEDIA RELEASE                                   03/807            

 

 

 Government Deceit Over Refugees Continues    

 Government claims that the 14 people aboard the Minasa Bone that arrived at Melville Island did  not claim asylum in Australia simply cannot be believed, the Australian Democrats say.   

 Democrats’ Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said the Government’s record was one of consistently  misleading the Australian people about the legality and impact of their treatment of refugees.   

 “This latest episode has been characterised by secrecy, deceit and blatant lies.  The Government has  lost the right to be trusted and believed,” Senator Bartlett said.   

 “The Government cannot seriously suggest that these people travelled all the way from Turkey,  then jumped on an unsafe boat to sail from Indonesia to Australia just out of idle curiosity.  Nor can  the Minister pretend that Kurdish people in Turkey do not suffer significant and constant  persecution.   

 “The Government’s insistence that it is not breaking international law is a joke.  Towing asylum  seekers back out to sea and refusing to assess their claims for protection is a flagrant breach of  international law, as well as common decency and humanity.  We are not meeting our obligations,  rather the Government is wasting millions of dollars trying to avoid them.”   

 Senator Bartlett said it was time the Government was honest about people seeking asylum:   - It is not illegal to arrive in Australia without a visa in order to seek protection from  persecution;  - The Government is a repeat offender in breaching international law through its policies 

 such as mandatory detention (especially of children), separating families, and towing  boats back out to sea;  - It is the Government’s laws (introduced with ALP support) which aim to prevent people  from being able to seek protection from persecution in Australia.   

 

 “The Government’s suggestions that ‘our borders are being eaten away’ and our ‘border security is  at risk’ from people smugglers are also a load of rubbish,” Senator Bartlett said.   

 “Threats to our security come from people like Frenchman Willie Brigitte who can waltz in here on  an electronic travel visa and swan around the country doing whatever he wants for six months.  The  threats do not come from asylum seekers who report their presence and intentions and can be fully  assessed the minute they arrive.   

 “The Government’s actions do not target people smugglers, they target refugees. Refugees are the  ones being made to suffer.  Thousands of them are living in the Australian community in fear.  They  face an uncertain future and are being kept forcibly separated from their families.”
