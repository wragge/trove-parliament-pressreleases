 100 Days Is Far Too Long, Prime Minister  Media Release | Spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young   Monday 18th January 2010, 5:36pm

 It's time for the Federal Government to step in and end the standoff over the Tamil asylum-seekers who 

 have been left on a boat at Merak in Indonesia for 100 days, according to the Australian Greens. 

 

 Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, Greens Spokesperson on Immigration and Human Rights, says the Greens

 support the rallies and vigils being held around the world today in support of the vulnerable men, women

 "It is disgraceful that the 240 or so people remaining on board this boat - 100 of whom have been found to

 situation in the hope that the public would forget about these vulnerable people. 

 

 "Mr Rudd has hammered home the message that his government has a tough but humane approach to 

 asylum-seekers - but his handling of this case from the very start has been marked by a total lack of 

 leadership. This needs to stop, now.''
