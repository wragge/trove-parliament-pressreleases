 Force for Good? Sixty Years of Australian Peacekeeping  ‘The ADF and Peacekeeping’  By Lieutenant General K.J. Gillespie, AO, DSC, CSM  13 September 2007 

 

 

 Good afternoon distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.  It is a great privilege to speak at 

 this  conference  today  on  behalf  of  the  Australian  Defence  Force.     As  you  are  aware  this  

 conference is timed to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the first Australian Defence Force 

 contribution  to  peacekeeping  in  Indonesia  in  1947.  That  first  mission  consisted  of  just  four  

 personnel, and since that somewhat humble entrÃ©e into peacekeeping the Defence Force has 

 contributed  over  30  000  personnel  to  subsequent  missions  all  around  the  globe.    I’ve  been  

 privileged to have served in two such missions, in Namibia in the late 1989/90 in a Chapter 6 

 UN Mission, and in East Timor in 2000/01 in a Chapter 7 mission.  

 Today, in my present job as Vice Chief of the Defence Force and Chief of Joint Operations I 

 Command  all  ADF  operations,  including  the  5  United  Nations  and  3  multi-lateral  peace  

 keeping operations that the Defence Force is currently conducting. I have recently been held 

 accountable  for  the  Defence  Force’s  conduct  of  Peace  Keeping  by  the  Senate  Standing  

 Committee  of  Foreign  Affairs,  Defence  and  Trade  in  their  inquiry  into  Australia’s  

 involvement in Peacekeeping Operations.  

 In my presentation today I will explore the major lessons the Defence Force has learned from 

 its peacekeeping operations, and how, based on these lessons, the Defence Force has adapted 

 to the challenges of contemporary peace operations. 

 Increasingly,  these  contemporary  peacekeeping  operations  are  about  more  than  simply  

 achieving  military  objectives.   They  are  also  concerned  with  ensuring  political  stability,  

 promoting good governance and human rights, providing humanitarian assistance and laying 

 the  groundwork  for  sustainable  economic  development.   So how well has Australia and its 

 Page 2 of 15 

 Defence  Forces  adapted  to  this  broader  objective,  and  what  have  we  learned  from  our  

 peacekeeping experiences? 

 The Australian Defence Force has participated in 39 peace operations under the command of 

 the United Nations and 16 non-United Nations peacekeeping operations, many of which were 

 sanctioned by the UN.    Our troops have been deployed as peacekeepers, peace-builders and 

 peace  enforcers.     More  than  ever,  the  Australian  Defence  Force  is  being  asked  to  support  

 complex peace operations that include tackling internal instability within integrated missions 

 that are comprised of military, police, civilian, and humanitarian organisations. 

 

 BACKGROUND 

 Sixty years ago Australia was one of the first countries to respond to what is now referred to 

 as  “traditional  peacekeeping”,  when  four  officers  were  deployed  as  part  of  the  UN  Good  

 Offices  Commission  to  Indonesia.   In  this  form  of  peacekeeping,  the  soldier’s  task  was  to  

 observe, monitor, and report on compliance with ceasefire or truce agreements.    This early 

 model  gave  rise  to  the  oft-quoted  phrase  by  the  then  Secretary  General  Dag  HammarskjÃ¶ld  

 that  “peacekeeping  is  not  a  soldiers  job,  but  only  a  soldier  can  do  it”.     The  world  has  

 certainly  moved  on,  and  now  there  are  very  few  examples  of  a  peacekeeping  force  being  

 deployed into a situation that could be described as post-conflict, and increasingly less under 

 Chapter 6 mandates.     The most common scenario is a Chapter 7 mandate where consent by 

 all parties is not assured, and with peacekeeping forces deployed into an operation area that 

 may be characterised as a fragile or failed state.    It is most likely that a variety of operational 

 roles will be required from peace making to peace building, sometimes simultaneously.  

 Additionally,  the  complexity  of  modern  peacekeeping  operation  requires  a  broader  range  of  

 skills from Australian Defence Force peacekeepers.   Winning the trust and confidence of the 

 local people requires personnel that are not only well trained and equipped, but also sensitive 

 and respectful of the local customs and culture.  It also requires an inherent understanding of 

 the role of the peacekeeper in the broader context of the mission.   

 

 CONTEMPORARY PEACEKEEPING - MAJOR LESSONS LEARNED 

 The Mandate 

 Early mandates for Peacekeeping Operations demanded consent of the opposing parties under 

 Chapter 6 of the UN Charter.  Most, if not all, recent Peace Keeping operations have been, or 

 are being conducted, without the full consent of all stakeholders in the region. These missions 

 Page 3 of 15 

 often do not occur in the context of a truce arrangement and this results in the missions being 

 constituted under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter.  

 Within  this  reality,  should  the  United  Nations  ask  Australia  to  commit  to  a  peace  keeping  

 operation,  it  will  likely  be  under  a  Chapter  7  mandate.     It  follows  that  to  be  capable  of  

 responding  to  a  broader  spectrum  of  threats  expected  on  such  missions,  the  Australian  

 Defence  Force  will  utilise  its  preparedness  and  capabilities  necessary  for  the  Defence  of  

 Australia  to  participate  in  complex  UN  or  coalition  Peace  keeping  operations.   Further  we  

 will  need  to  retain  an  agility  to  be  able  to  adapt  our  capability  to  evolve  with  the  changing  

 character of peace operations in increasingly complex emergencies. 

 The  Australian  Defence  Force’s  experience  in  East  Timor  confirms  the  need  for  a  clear,  

 credible  and  achievable  mandate.   In  the  case  of  UNTAET,  the  violence  and  cruelty  of  the  

 militia  were  such  that  there  was  no  hesitation  to  react  forcefully  -  first  by  offering  the  

 possibility  to  members  of  the  militia  to  give  themselves  up,  and  second  by  pursuing  them.     

 The simplification of the Rules of Engagement (ROE) - i.e. ‘shoot to kill’ if there was a threat 

 to  the  mission  was  also  a  deterrent  to  the  militia.     It  is  still  not  clear  whether  this  modus 

 operandi could, or should, be adopted for other missions.     Some commentators worried that 

 the  action  of  UNTAET  might  have  stretched  the  definition  of  self-defence,  and  blurred  the  

 line  between  Chapter  6  and  Chapter  7  of  the  UN  Charter,  whilst  some  United  Nations  

 operations  in  recent  times  have  demonstrated  how  the  strength  or  weakness  of  a  mandate,  

 Status  of  Force  Agreement  and  mission-specific  Rules  of  Engagement,  can  influence  the  

 success, or otherwise, of a peace operation.  

 The UN Operation in Somalia I (UNOSOM 1, 1992-93) was established by the UN Security 

 Council  to  monitor  the  cease-fire  in  Mogadishu,  provide  protection  and  security  for  UN  

 personnel,  their  equipment  and  supplies  at  the  seaports  and  airports,  and  for  the  escort  of  

 deliveries  of  humanitarian  assistance  (HA)  supplies  to  distribution  centres.      The  mission  

 was unsuccessful because its initial mandate under Chapter 6 was not robust enough, and it 

 did not allow the mission to provide adequate protection for the convoys.     Consequently, 

 UNOSOM  1  had  to  be  replaced  by  a  US-led  coalition  (the  Unified  Task  Force,  UNITAF)  

 which had a robust mandate and adequate ROE.  UNITAF was then succeeded by UNOSOM 

 2 (1993-95), which was a Chapter 7 UN mission authorised to use enforcement measures to 

 establish  a  secure  environment  throughout  Somalia  for  Humanitarian  Assistance  operations.     

 This mission included civilian police, who assisted with implementing judicial processes and 

 re-invigorating the local police force.

 UN mandates generally do not provide for security force activity outside the boundaries of the 

 host  nation,  This  complicates  planning  and  security  considerations.   For  example,  in  

 September  2000,  a  series  of  armed  militia  attacks  against  East  Timorese  people  in  refugee  

 camps  in  West  Timor  culminated  in  the  murder  of  three  UN  staff  members  in  Atambua,  

 which  resulted  in  Humanitarian  Assistance  efforts  in  the  region  being  suspended.     In  this  

 case  the  Peacekeeping  Force  of  the  UN  Transitional  Administration  in  East  Timor  was  

 restricted  to  operations  east  of  the  border  and  was  therefore  powerless  to  intervene.   

 Fortunately,  the  Government  of  Indonesia  intervened  in  West  Timor  by  taking  immediate  

 steps to re-establish safety and security in the refugee camps and for humanitarian workers.  

 In  contrast,  the  deployment  of  the  International  Force  in  East  Timor  acknowledged  the  

 lessons  learned  from  previous  Peace  Keeping  missions.   INTERFET’s  authority  for  

 deployment  was  timely  and  robust  with  host  government  consent,  and  it  created  a  highly  

 desirable environment for security and humanitarian operations.     There was also a strong 

 coalition  of  international  support,  involving  some  22  countries  that  committed  troops,  

 equipment and essential strategic lift while other support was provided by the United States. 

 Even  so,  the  decision  to  deploy  will  often  hinge  on  Australia’s  national  objectives  and  the  

 Government’s  satisfaction  with  the  proposed  mandate.     To  get  to  this  point  some  key  

 questions must first be answered: 

 â¢ Are the provisions of the Security Council mandate clear?  

 - Does it support the peace process?  

 â¢ Will  the  tasks  assigned  to  the  military  force  lead  to  the  achievement  of  the  mission's  

 political objectives and the accomplishment of the mandate? 

 - Are  the  tasks  appropriate  for  peacekeepers  to  perform  and  are  the  rules  of  

 engagement appropriate?  

 - Are  the  tasks  realistically  achievable  by  the  military  force,  given  the  state  of the  

 conflict; or  

 - are the tasks too ambitious for the conditions on the ground?  

 - Can the peacekeeping force establish a safe and secure environment so as to instil 

 trust (via confidence-building measures) between the warring factions? 

 -  Does  the  peacekeeping  force  have  the  credibility  to  maintain  the  consent  of  the  

 parties?  

 

 

 â¢ Is the proposed force appropriate in size and composition to accomplish the mandate?  

 Page 5 of 15 

 - Is the peacekeeping force adequately commanded, especially if there is a need for 

 peace enforcement operations?  

 - Are  the  operational  strategy  and  force  deployments  appropriate  to  achieve  stated  

 objectives?  

 - Does  it  have  the  required  capabilities--for  example,  staff  planning,  command  

 leadership, intelligence collection, operational mobility, communications, logistic 

 support, force protection, demobilisation, de-mining, etc.?  

 - Is  the  force  mix  of  national  contingents  appropriate  and  conducive  to  unity  of  

 effort? 

 Without a clear understanding of all these issues the Government will be unlikely to commit 

 Australian troops to an operation. 

 

 Responsibility to Protect 

 In late 2001 UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan observed: 

 Today’s real borders are not between nations, but between powerful and powerless, free and 

 fettered,  privileged  and  humiliated.   Today,  no  walls  can  separate  humanitarian  or  human  

 rights crises in one part of the world from national security crises in another. 

 This  observation  encapsulates  the  reality  of  dealing  with  trans-national  issues  that  are  not  

 neatly  contained  within  borders.     This  reality  adversely  effected  UN  sponsored  peace  

 keeping operations in the 1990’s namely Rwanda, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia.   The 

 scale of the human tragedy in these countries resulted in the UN being soundly criticised for 

 failing  to  provide  security  to  the  local  population  or  a  failure  to  achieve  a  mandate.     

 Disenfranchisement  with  the  UN  process  was  a  factor  in  Australia’s  decision  to  form  

 INTERFET outside the UN banner.   

 However since that time the principle of  ”Responsibility to Protect” espoused by Secretary 

 General Annan was endorsed by the general Assembly in 2005, and by the Security Council 

 in 2006.  Responsibility to protect requires nations to protect their populations from genocide, 

 war crimes and wholesale human rights violations.    Should they fail to do so, the Security 

 Council  may  sanction  a  Chapter  7  intervention  with  the  primary  aim  to  protect  the  local  

 population.  This can be done without the consent of the host government.    One can only 

 hope  that  this  new  development  will  ensure  for  the  security  and  protection  of  all  affected  

 parties, not just the force protection of the deployed UN force as has often been the case in the 

 past.  But, this is by no means an assured outcome, and the need to ensure the protection of 

 the  population,  not  just  the  UN  effort,  was  behind  the  Australian  Government’s  decision  to  

 Page 6 of 15 

 work  with  regional  countries  to  mount  the  International  Security  Force  in  Timor  Lest  last  

 year.  The ISF was, like INTERFET, outside the UN Banner. 

 

 Force Structure 

 The structure of the Australian Defence Force is based on the national tasks articulated in the 

 Defence White Paper which requires the Defence Force to protect Australia and its National 

 Interests.     Australia’s  Military  Strategy  has  resulted  in  the  development  of  a  modern  and  

 agile conventional force capable of high end military tasks.  However, most of the operations 

 currently  undertaken  by  the  Defence  Force  are  not  against  conventional  enemies.    We  

 increasingly  find  ourselves  operating  in  complex  war  fighting  operations,  against  illusive  

 enemies, which use asymmetric tactics in an attempt to nullify our technological superiority.   

 This  new  paradigm  has  been  neatly  encapsulated  by  the  United  Sates  Marine  Corp  in  their  

 Three Black concept: 

 In one block, a Marine will provide food, care and comfort an emaciated child. In the next 

 block, you will see this Marine with outstretched arms, separating warring tribes. Then in the 

 third city block, this same Marine will engage in intense house-to-house fighting with hostile 

 forces . . . all on the same day, all within three city blocks 

 The Australian Defence Force’s force structure continues to provide forces that are adaptable 

 to peace operations.  In the immediate future we are likely to undertake a range of operations 

 other than conventional war, both in our region and beyond.   As a result, preparing for peace 

 operations will take a more prominent place in our defence planning than it has in the past.  

 Although equipment procured for Defence of Australia will continue to suit peace operations, 

 the  demanding  nature  of  contemporary  peace  operations  may  involve  adjustments  to  our  

 individual  and  collective  training  regimens.   We  have  already  seen  evidence  of  this  in  our  

 biannual exercise with the United States, Exercise Talisman Sabre, the most recent of which 

 was  conducted  in  Queensland  in  the  middle  of  this  year.   We  expect  that  many  future  

 exercises,  while  having  elements  of  the  continuum of  conventional  war;  will  include  strong  

 components of stabilisation and peace operations.   

 In peacekeeping operations the boundary between a benign situation and open conflict, either 

 against  local  irregulars  or  more  capable  armed  forces,  can  become  blurred.    Therefore,  a  

 visual  deterrent  that  is  commensurate  with  the  mandate  is  required.      Even  in  benign  

 situations,  a  clearly  evident  capability  to  use  force  can  help  to  keep  complex  emergencies  

 peaceful.      This  implies  that  the  capabilities  we  need  for  these  types  of  ‘complex  

 Page 7 of 15 

 emergencies’  will  have  much  in  common  with  those  we  develop  for  more  conventional  

 conflicts. 

 The  Australian  Defence  Force  aims  to  continually  develop  and  maintain  high  levels  of  war  

 fighting skills, and this has allowed our forces to adapt to the challenges of lower level peace 

 operations with relative ease.    But we don’t assume that high end war fighting skills make us 

 naturally capable of conducting peace operations.  These contemporary roles are continually 

 supported by the efforts of the Defence Force’s centres for training and doctrine development.   

 This  includes  our  own  Peacekeeping  Centre,  which  prepares  peace  operations  training  

 material,  contributes  to  the  development  of  relevant  doctrine,  and  provides  seminars  for  

 selected  personnel  from  within  the  Australian  Defence  Organisation,  external  agencies  and  

 foreign nations.  In this way we stay current and agile.     Additionally, lessons learned from 

 the  deployment  to  East  Timor  indicated  that  some  elements  of  doctrine  and  training  for  

 personnel engaged in peace operations, particularly those operating at the strategic, or Whole 

 of  Government  level,  may  require  supplementation.     The  recent  initiative  to  place  three  

 Australian  Federal  Police  officers  in  our  Joint  Operations  Centre  and  at  the  Australian  

 Defence Force Warfare Centre is a direct result of the lessons learned from both East Timor 

 and  Solomon  Islands.     Greater  understanding  and  liaison  between  the  “whole  of  

 government”  agencies  involved  in  peace  keeping  can  only  improve  interoperability  and  

 ultimately our performance on operations. 

 The Defence Force is again reviewing the suitability of its existing training regime for peace 

 operations, noting again that such training is supplementary to our primary war fighting roles 

 and  combat  related  training.     A  primary  consideration  in  this  review  is  the  UN’s  

 strengthened  resolve  to  formally  standardise  and  evaluate  the  level  of  training  achieved  by  

 Troop Contributing Nations.     In addition to its pursuit of more consistent standards of core 

 military  skills,  the  UN  also  stresses  the  need  for  personnel  in  the  field  to  have  appropriate  

 mission specific training.     

 A particular focus of the UN is also to ensure that Troop Contributing Nations demonstrate 

 respect for local norms, culture and practices,  and to achieve designated standards of training 

 in human rights issues.  These issues include those relating to gender, children, refugees and 

 international  displaced  persons.     As  a  consistent  and  well  respected  contributor  to  peace  

 operations,  it  is  in  the  Defence  Force’s  interests  to  demonstrably  achieve  and  train  to  these  

 standards.     But we are not doing this simply to be good international citizens.  Such training 

 makes good sense, and can potentially be a force multiplier.     Mission rehearsal exercises 

 and formal pre-deployment training are routine features of all ADF operational deployments.

 Regional Arrangements 

 Australia has a long history of working closely with its traditional allies.    Increasingly we 

 have been encouraged by the willingness of our regional neighbours to join with us in peace 

 keeping missions closer to home.    The success of the missions in East Timor, Bougainville 

 and  Solomon  Islands  were  in  no  small  part  due  to  the  close  cooperation  between  the  

 contributing  nations  of  South  East  Asia  and  the  South  West  Pacific.    Indeed,  regional  

 arrangements are becoming more favoured by the UN as That institution struggles to mount, 

 manage  and  sustain  the  myriad  of  Peace  Keeping  Operations  around  the  globe,  and  in  

 particular, Africa.   

 So  what  advantages  has  the  ADF  seen  resulting  from  regional  arrangements  such  as  the  

 Regional  Assistance  Mission  to  the  Solomon  Islands?         Well,  we  are  normally  familiar  

 with the history of the conflicts we face, and we are broadly aware of the cultural sensitivities 

 of the situation under consideration.   But we don’t always know it all, and we’ve found great 

 benefit in being able to leverage off the knowledge and experiences of our regional partners.    

 As a consequence we have been able to apply a better and more balanced perspective to our 

 appreciations  of  the  nature  of  local  conflicts,  and  in  providing  more  fulsome  advice  to  

 Government as our leaders have consider the need to commit troops.    

 Because  of  the  shorter  distances  involved,  a  regional  coalition  is  better  placed  to  respond  

 more  rapidly  and  it  removes  the  need  for  protracted  Security  Council  considerations.     

 Regional  countries  have  a  greater  stake  in  the  security  situation  and  therefore  are  more  

 inclined to provide a stronger focus on solutions.  So too are they more inclined to stay the 

 longer course, particularly through the vital post-conflict reconstruction phase.   Finally, our 

 increasingly close military contacts with our neighbours has seen our levels of transparency, 

 trust  and  interoperability  improve  dramatically.   This  contributes  greatly  to  successful  early  

 planning and subsequently the better conduct of Peace Keeping Operations.   

 We  now  have  regular  contact  with  most  of  the  ASEAN  countries  through  annual  

 peacekeeping exercises such as Pirap Jabiru, a biennial exercise we conduct with Thailand. 

 Exercise Pirap  Jabiru  has  gone  from  strength  to  strength  and  now  includes  observers  from  

 Indonesia,  The  Philippines,  Cambodia,  Vietnam,  Mongolia,  Malaysia,  Singapore  and  the  

 United  Kingdom.      We  are  also  developing  standard  operating  procedures  in  partnership  

 with the Indonesian Military.    In turn, this close cooperation with our regional partners in 

 peace keeping operations has further strengthened the military to military relationships with 

 consequential spin-offs in other areas of Defence Cooperation.

 Culture 

 Australia is a successful, long time, multi-cultural society; we have learned to be respectful of 

 different cultures, and with the multitude of off shore military operations of the past decade 

 this is particularly in the military.    This respect, and anxiousness to understand the cultures 

 of  the  Nations  in  which  we  operate,  has  borne  considerable  success  in  peace  keeping  

 operations  in  countries  as  diverse  as  Somalia,  Cambodia  Bougainville  and  Afghanistan.   

 That’s not to say that there isn’t more to do.  We must remain vigilant, and our training and 

 force  preparation  must  continue  to  ensure  that  our  peacekeepers  are  fully  aware  of  the  

 differing cultures they may encounter during operations.     In preparing our troops, we now 

 understand it is not just the culture of the host country we must be cognisant of, but those of 

 other  nations’  peacekeepers,  the  institutional  cultures  of  the  UN  agencies  and  increasingly  

 Non Government Organisations, even how our own cultural behaviours may impact on others.    

 For  example,  our  egalitarian  approach  to  life,  does  not  always  sit  well  in  some  cultural  

 environments.   We have learnt that no matter how successful the military operation, it can all 

 be  brought  down  like  a  house  of  cards  through  a  small,  seemingly  innocuous,  incident  of  

 cultural insensitivity. 

 A positive outcome of the integration of women in the Australian Defence Force is the added 

 influence  women  peacekeepers  have  in  engaging  the  most  tragically  affected  group  in  any  

 post conflict situation, the women and children.    Winning the trust of this vulnerable group 

 can also be vital in some cultures, because it often the women in a society that play the key 

 role in conflict resolution and reconciliation. 

 Intelligence  

 Intelligence provides commanders and their staffs with the fullest possible understanding of 

 the belligerents operating within a theatre.     Moreover, intelligence at all levels supports the 

 planning and execution of an operation by delivering timely and accurate information about 

 belligerents and their influences, aims and objectives, courses of action, intentions, centres of 

 gravity, and vulnerabilities. 

 Because  of  the  nature  of  UN  operations  and  the  UN  culture,  Member  States  and  the  UN  

 Security Council for many years did not see a need for nor endorse the need for ‘intelligence 

 operations’ as an integral role of the UN military component.  This was due to a combination 

 of  factors,  including  the  sensitivity  of  the  information  collected,  the  UN  perception  that  

 intelligence  collection  may  result  in  the  military  component  not  being  considered  impartial,  

 Page 10 of 15 

 and  a  desire  to  avoid  competing  stakeholder  interests.      However,  recent  developments  in  

 peace  operations  have  had  significant  ramifications  for  the  safety  of  personnel  and  the  

 conduct of operations.    An unfortunate example is the targeting of the UN Compound in Iraq 

 in  2003.   There  is  now  a  clear  understanding  in  the  UNDPKO  of  the  need  for  adequate  

 intelligence assets and appropriate force capabilities in each new mission. 

 Joint  Mission  Analysis  Cells  are  now  regularly  established  in  Peace  Keeping  missions.      

 These cells are staffed with civilian and military analysts who provide centralised direction, 

 collection, processing and dissemination of information for the mission.      The role of the 

 Analysis Cell is to provide the expertise to handle information, conduct and present analysis, 

 build  databases,  and  provide  advice  at  a  level  that  will  ensure  that  decisions  are  made  with  

 awareness of all available and relevant factors.    The analysis cell is the focal point for the 

 fusion  of  information  from  all  sources.     It  undertakes  in-depth  current  and  longer  term  

 analysis of issues affecting the mission and draws on information that is available from open 

 sources as well as that gathered by all elements of the mission.  

 The strategic intent of the Analysis Cell is to harness information from multiple sources and 

 services in order to provide the mission leadership with the ability to deter and defeat threats 

 posed by armed groups and other spoilers within the area of operations.    However, for it to 

 work,  it  is  essential  that  all  parties  within  the  mission  are  willing  to  cooperate  and  share  

 information  for  the  common  good  of  the  mission.     Therefore,  it  is  important  that  

 communication  and  liaison  are  established  from  the  beginning  to  engender  good  working  

 relations between all the components of a peace mission.    The same principle applies for the 

 liaison  with  external  agencies  such  as  Non  Government  Organisations  and  with  other  

 intelligence bodies in the region.  The ADF and the wider Defence organisation expend a lot 

 of effort in ensuring that the intelligence architecture for multi-national missions if sound and 

 that  each  element  of  the  force  has  the  information  it  needs  to  survive  and  succeed.   We  do  

 however, have some way to go in changing our own cultures to do more intelligence sharing 

 with non-military participants, such as NGO’s.  We’re working on this. 

 Civil-Military Cooperation (CIMIC)  

 Complex  peace  operations  environments  demand  international  and  Non  Government  

 Organisation humanitarian agencies to work alongside, or with the assistance of, the military 

 peacekeeping  force.    Some  of  these  ‘partners’  are  unwilling  or  are  vehemently  opposed  to  

 cooperating with the military.  Its a matter of culture and outlook.   In general, humanitarian 

 Non  Government  Organisations  and  other  international  agencies  are  guided  by  three  

 principles when they respond to a humanitarian crisis.    These are humanity, impartiality and 

 Page 11 of 15 

 neutrality.     Non-Government Organisations’ perceptions of impartiality and neutrality are 

 sometime compromised if operating cooperatively with the military.  

 Although  the  military  and  international  humanitarian  organisations  may  find  themselves  

 working side-by-side in complex emergencies, each operates differently.    As a consequence, 

 they  each  tend  to  regard  their  activities  and  information  as  proprietary,  believing  their  

 respective organisational integrity and therefore mission, are at stake should they appear to be 

 ‘co-opted’  by  the  military  on  one  hand,  or  for  the  military  to  ‘mission  creep’  more  into  the  

 humanitarian space on the other.    Collaboration, even if only perceived, can spell danger for 

 Non  Government  Organisation’s  that  are  bound  by  a  mandate  based  on  the  principle  of  

 neutrality.  Military participants on the other hand, are not involved through any discretionary 

 process of their own, and once deployed will work exhaustively at meeting the full range of 

 effects demanded by their mission statement. 

 From  a  military  commander’s  perspective,  coordination,  and  cooperation  with  the  host  

 nation(s) and humanitarian agencies is aimed at developing an environment that achieves the 

 military end state and minimises any adverse effects on the civil population.  In this way they 

 support  wider  humanitarian  relief  and  peace  building  operations.    We  need  to  do  more  to  

 ensure that military and wider humanitarian efforts are coordinated so as to achieve a wider 

 outcome than just security or humanitarian aid.      So important do we see the need for better 

 understanding between the military and non government organisations,  that last year an extra 

 exercise  was  added  to  the  curriculum  of  the  Australian  Command  and  Staff  Course  at  the  

 Australian Defence College.    This exercise involves military planners working side by side 

 with representatives of other government agencies, and non government agencies to resolve 

 complex  scenarios  in  a  peace  keeping  and  stability  operation  exercise  environment.      The  

 practical benefits of this training will not only show that we’re serious about working more 

 harmoniously and effectively with non-military agencies, but it will produce better results in 

 our next operational deployment. 

 The  key  task  of  the  military  contribution  to  a  peace  operation  will  normally  be  the  

 establishment  and  maintenance  of  a  secure  environment  within  which  humanitarian  and  

 governance functions can be undertaken without fear of intervention by third parties.    This is 

 not  to  say  that  the  military  will  not  be  intimately  involved  in  the  provision  of  early  

 humanitarian aid and other assistance.  But we will always attempt to hand over responsibility 

 of these assumed tasks to the appropriately and more often better equipped and trained civil 

 agencies as soon as possible.     Failure to establish some level of civil-military relations and 

 coordination has proven to have adverse consequences for the humanitarian community and 

 Page 12 of 15 

 the overall success of the mission.    It is clear to us that early engagement, the establishment 

 of close working relationships, and joint training must be made more robust.    We would like 

 to see that process happen in Australia and before we have our next deployment.     I look to 

 many of you sitting in the audience to help us get this going as a matter of priority. 

 Moreover, from a purely military perspective effective Civil military cooperation has already 

 proven to be an essential tool for deployed commanders.  Where used effectively it can be as 

 effective, or more effective, than a range of more kinetic effects. 

 

 Command and Control  

 Ultimately,  the  key  to  any  successful  peace  operation  is  achieving,  not  only  efficient  

 command  and  control  within  the  military  force,  but  also  effective  cooperation  and  

 coordination between the military and all the civilian agencies involved.  

 Questions  about  the  effectiveness  of  the  UN  command  and  control  arrangements  have  been  

 around  for  a  long  time.      The  UN  has  learned,  sometimes  painfully,  that  when  a  unified  

 command approach is not adopted risks increase,  and the risks of casualties and escalating 

 mission  costs  become  a  reality.     It  is  clear  to  us  in  the  military  that  all  agencies  within  a  

 peacekeeping mission need to function in a unified fashion and that the mission is conducted 

 in a way that reflects the will, and solidarity, of the international community and the needs of 

 the  nation  being  assisted.     In  short,  contemporary  peacekeeping  operations  require  a  clear  

 authoritative  mandate,  clear  accountabilities  and  collective  and  cohesive  whole  of  force  

 planning.  This is not as easily achieved as I’ve made it sound, and it will certainly require 

 some cultural change, and perhaps further structural change in the UN.    

 

 The Integrated Approach 

 In the twenty-first century, peacekeeping operations need to be part of a more comprehensive 

 and long-term approach to stabilisation.    World Bank research published in 2003 indicates 

 that  44%  of  countries  return  to  conflict  within  five  years  of  the  completion  of  a  Peace  

 Keeping mission.   Thus, success in the future must be measured, not only in terms of halting 

 the violence, but in addressing the root causes of the conflict in such a way that security and 

 becomes enduring.   This will require nations, individually or collectively through the UN or 

 regional  arrangements,  to  take  a  far  more  strategic  approach  to  peace  operations  and  re-construction.  There will need to be a wider application of national and international power - 

 not just military power or humanitarian assistance - and terms describing effort as whole of 

 government, or whole of nation, or whole of UN, become more than clichÃ©s.  

 Page 13 of 15 

 To  meet  the  multi-dimensional  nature  of  peace  keeping  operations,  Defence  now  routinely  

 finds  itself  engaged  in  consultation  and  planning  with  a  variety  of  agencies  such  as  

 Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Attorney General’s Department, Aus AID, the 

 Australian  Electoral  Commission  and  the  Australian  Federal  Police.      Recent  Australian  

 experiences in Bougainville, East Timor and Solomon Islands have proven that this approach 

 works.    Most recently in Solomon Islands, a DFAT lead mission saw the primary operational 

 responsibility  fall  to  the  Federal  Police  with  the  Defence  in  a  support  role.    We’ve  started  

 down the whole of government path, but there is some distance yet to travel. 

 

 The Need for Integrated Common Training 

 The  principal  government  agencies  that  contribute  to  training  for  peace  operations  are  the  

 ADF  Peacekeeping  Centre,  the  39th  Personnel  Support  Battalion,  the  Australian  Federal  

 Police  International  Deployment  Group  and  the  Asia  Pacific  Centre  for  Military  Law.      

 These  four  centres  combine  to  prepare  Australian  personnel  to  work  overseas  on  Peace  

 Support/  Stabilisation  Operations.      All  centres  use  input  from  the  same  domestic  and  

 international agencies and actors to update their materials.     But, once again, I believe that 

 we  can  do  better.   Some  integration  and  perhaps  the  establishment  of  a  united  Whole  of  

 Government  peace  operations  training  establishment,  or  at  least  a  research  institute,  would  

 seem to be logical, and both cost and operationally effective.    Such a development, in my 

 opinion, should be looked at sooner rather than later. 

 

 Interoperability with the AFP 

 Operations  in  East  Timor  and  the  Solomon  Islands  signalled  a  new  phase  in  Australia’s  

 involvement  with  peacekeeping  operations  due  to  the  extensive  use  of  law  enforcement  

 agencies coupled with a military commitment.  The extensive and increasing use of Civilian 

 Police, and the executive powers that the police have been granted, have impacted greatly on 

 the conduct of operations.      

 Peacekeepers are frequently deployed into areas in which local law and order has ceased to 

 function.    The re-establishment and maintenance of Law and Order is not a military task 

 and  our  troops  are  not  trained  for  such  operations.      It  is  far  more  appropriate  that  these  

 duties be performed by police.    

 Defence  and  the  Federal  Police  have  worked  alongside  each  other  on  many  missions  and  

 we’ve learned many lessons on the interoperability and interdependence of the two agencies.  

 Until recently, the Federal Police was not structured for deployment and the capacity of the 

 Page 14 of 15 

 Federal police to quickly and in strength was limited.  This often drew soldiers uncomfortably 

 into the law and order environment and their success was somewhat patchy.   

 The creation of the International Deployment Group has been a boon to the ADF and we have 

 seen a rapid closing of the capability gap which existed between the Australian Defence Force 

 and the Australian Federal Police.   There is still much to be done, particularly in the areas of 

 doctrine, training, logistic support and operational planning, but the sense of purpose, and the 

 mutual  desire  of  both  organisations  to  be  better  prepared  for  our  next  challenge  is  

 outstanding.     

 

 CONCLUSION 

 Over  the  past  60  years  the  Australian  Defence  Force  has  had  a  proud  history  of  supporting  

 peace  keeping  operations.   The  nature  of  peace  operations  has  to  evolve  and  has  become  

 much  more  complex.     Similarly  the  Australian  Defence  Force  has  continued  to  evolve  in  

 order to stay relevant and able to succeed, regardless of the level of complexity.  I believe that 

 we  can  demonstrate  a  learning  culture  and  our  undoubted  success  across  so  many  different  

 types of operation in so many different parts of the globe is a testament to our people, their 

 professionalism and their adaptability.   

 Complexity,  and  the  need  for  peace  operations  to  more  than  simply  re-establish  short  term  

 security  for  populations  does  demand  that  our  national  approach  changes.   If  we  are  to  

 provide for long term stability and progress in fragile nations, we have to bring more than just 

 military, police and humanitarian power to the table.  A more focussed whole of government, 

 whole of nation, whole of region approach is required.    We have a proud record of success, 

 we have a firm foundation on which to build and the logic of the way ahead is clear.  We need 

 to get on with it, and Defence stands ready to work with you.  Thank you.
