 JOINT MEDIA RELEASE 

 AUSTRALIA-EUROPEAN COMMISSION MINISTERIAL CONSULTATIONS   Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer, Minister for Trade Mark Vaile and   EU Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten    16 April 2003   

 The  19th  Ministerial  Consultations  between  Australia  and  the  European  Commission   held  in  Melbourne  today  focused  on  a  range  of  bilateral  and  international  issues  and   underlined the strength of our cooperation.    

 We agreed that since the signing in 1997 of the Joint Declaration between Australia and  the European Union, we have achieved a dynamic work program across a broad agenda.   In  the  Joint  Declaration,  we  have  also  created  a  framework  for  constructive   consultations in areas where the two sides do not share common ground (the details are  set out in a ‘stocktake’ document available online at www.dfat.gov.au).   

 Looking  ahead,  we  reviewed  our  cooperation  and  identified  priorities  for  our  future   work.   These  will  involve  intensified  cooperation  on:  security  and  strategic  issues   including  counter-terrorism;  ambitious  outcomes  on  trade  including  improving  the   international  trading  environment  to  benefit  least-developed  countries;  strengthening   our links on education and science and technology; pursuing common interests in major  international developments in transport and the environment agenda; building our joint  capacity  to  deliver  development  cooperation  programs  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region  and   managing  the  challenges  posed  by  global  people  flows  (detailed  in  the  attached   document and online at www.dfat.gov.au and www.delaus.cec.eu.int).    

 We had an in-depth discussion on international issues, including recent developments in  the  DPRK,  Iraq,  the  Middle  East  and  the  Asia-Pacific  region.   We  recognise  we  will   continue to share a vital interest in consulting regularly on our respective approaches to  an increasingly complex and challenging global environment.   

 We  also  had  a  vigorous  and  frank  exchange  on  the  tough  issues  currently  at  the   forefront of the WTO Doha negotiating round, including on our divergent positions on  agricultural trade.  We will nevertheless continue in our efforts to ensure an ambitious  approach overall.   

 We  discussed  the  historic  transformations  being  undertaken  in  the  European  Union,   including  its  expansion  to  25  Members  by  2004  and  the  re-examination  of  its   fundamental institutions.  Australia’s Foreign and Trade Policy White Paper explicitly  recognises  the  role  of  the  European  Union  as  a  global  actor  and  the  advantages  in   strengthening our bilateral relations with an increasingly integrated Europe.

 Australia and the European Union: an  agenda for cooperation   

 

 

 Australia and the European Union: an agenda for future cooperation   

 

 The 1997 Joint Declaration on Relations between Australia and the European Union  formalised  our  commitment  to  enhanced  cooperation  across  a  wide-ranging  agenda.     At  our  consultations  in  Brussels  in  April  2002,  we  agreed  to  take  stock  of   developments  in  our  relationship  since  the  signing  of  the  Joint  Declaration  and  to   identify priorities for future cooperation.   

 Our  review  reveals  that,  under  the  Joint  Declaration,  we  have  achieved  a  dynamic   work program and intensified exchanges between Australia and the European Union  to make progress on a diverse range of common interests (the details are set out in a  separate stocktaking document).  These have included establishing dialogue processes  on  trade  and  economic  matters,  strategic  issues,  immigration  and  asylum,   environment  policies  and  initiating  bilateral  cooperation  projects  in  education  and   science and technology.  We have also created a framework for frank but constructive  consultations in areas where we have diverging assessments and perspectives.    

 The  increasing  breadth  of  our  engagement  and  heightened  cooperation  has  reflected   the  further  integration  of  the  European  Union  and  its  enhanced  role  in  economic   policy, foreign and security policy and on justice and home affairs issues.   

 We reaffirm our determination to build upon our partnership to meet the challenges of  an increasingly interdependent world.  The objectives set out in the Joint Declaration  remain a sound and enduring foundation for enhancing our bilateral relationship and  pursuing  cooperation  in  the  international  environment.   In  particular,  we  have   identified  the  following  areas  as  high  priorities  in  our  cooperative  agenda  over  the   next five years:   

 

 Security and Strategic Issues    

 Noting  the  success  of  the  first  Australia-European  Union  strategic  dialogue  in  2002   and,  in  light  of  a  volatile  global  environment,  we  will  increase  sharing  of  our   assessments  on  international  and  regional  security  developments,  including  through   high-level exchanges on strategic issues.  We will devote particular attention to:   

 intensifying  cooperation  on  counter-terrorism  and  critical  infrastructure   protection,  including  by  exchanging  information  on  international  terrorist   networks  and  protection  of  information  infrastructure,  and  by  supporting   counter-terrorism capacity-building in the Asia-Pacific region;   

 enhancing  our  dialogue  on  non-proliferation  and  export  control  issues,   particularly  with  respect  to  regulating  trade  in  dual-use  items  and  on  our   respective engagement with countries of concern;    

 developing police cooperation, including exploring the possibility of bilateral  cooperation between Australian law enforcement authorities and Europol.   

 

 

 Trade    

 We commit to resolving outstanding issues in our bilateral Wine Agreement.   

 We will co-operate on progressing the WTO Doha Development Agenda and resolve  in particular to progress issues of mutual benefit. Notwithstanding differences in some  areas, we  will  continue  in  our  joint  efforts  to  ensure  an  ambitious  approach  overall:    on market access issues, on rule-making issues and on issues related to development.   We  recognise  the  importance  and  complexity  of  the  negotiations  on  agriculture  and   express  commitment  to  reaching  an  outcome  consistent  with  the  Doha  declaration.      We  will  continue  to  work  closely  together  with  the  aim  of  concluding  successfully   these negotiations.   

 As to developing countries, we will work together   

 to implement and promote policies to grant duty- and quota-free market access  for least-developed countries;   

 to assist these countries with access to affordable medicines; and   

 to deliver technical assistance and capacity-building activities;   

 We  will  focus  on  resolving  differences  on  bilateral  agriculture  and  trade  issues,   including  SPS  matters,  through  intensified  consultations,  particularly  in  the   Agricultural Trade and Marketing Experts’ Group.   

 The  two  sides  will  work  together  constructively  on  internal  and  international   regulatory  frameworks  (such  as  the  Office  International  des  Epizooties,  the   International Plant Protection Convention and the Codex Alimentarius).  

 

 

 Regarding the Mutual Recognition Agreement between us, we will work together to  simplify the operation of the Agreement and to remove existing origin restrictions.   

 

 Education and Science and Technology   

 Having  successfully  initiated  the  first  Australia-European  Union  pilot  project  on   higher  education  cooperation,  we  have  agreed  that  a  second  pilot  project  be   established  on  a  similar  matching-funding  basis  when  the  necessary  funding   procedures  will  have  been  finalised.   Following  on  from  the  pilot  projects  and   building on the existing cooperative relationship, we will consult further on the best  means to consolidate our partnership in prioritising education and research linkages in  the longer term   

 We  will  also  seek  to  broaden  opportunities  for  students  to  participate  in  exchanges,   including exploring Australia's participation in Erasmus World when adopted.   

 We  will  develop  an  action  plan  designed  to  stimulate  collaborative  Australia-European  Union  scientific  and  technological  projects  within  the  European  Union’s   Sixth  Framework  Program  for  Research.   This  will  include  practical  initiatives  such  as:   

 promoting awareness of science and technology (S&T) collaboration through   (1)   a  major  annual  S&T  event;  and  (2)  information  sessions  throughout   Australia  on  the  Sixth  Framework  Program  and  how  Australian  researchers   can become involved;   

 facilitating  joint  S&T  projects  by  conducting  joint  thematic  workshops  in   areas of mutual interest such as (1)  end-use energy efficiency programs; (2)    beef production - management systems and quarantine; (3)  nanomaterials for  personal  and  resource  security;  (4)   sustainable  land  transport;  and  (5)    information society technologies, as proposed to DG Research; and   

 an evaluation to assess the outcomes and benefits of joint participation in the  Fifth Framework Program for Research.   

 We are committed to make optimal use of the Forum for European-Australian Science  and Technology cooperation (FEAST) as a key vehicle in this process.   

 

 Transport    

 We  will  develop  arrangements  between  the  Australian  Global  Navigation  Satellite  System Coordination Committee and the European Commission to enable cooperation  associated with the Galileo Satellite Navigation project, including:   

 a framework for ongoing cooperation with the Galileo Joint Undertaking;    

 on ground infrastructure in Australia;  

 

 

 the potential for industrial co-operation;   

 scientific and commercial Galileo applications;    

 associated industry research and development;   

 co-operative  research  in  the  field  of  the  radiofrequency  spectrum,  including   research into mitigation of signal interference;   

 standards.    

 We  will  increase  cooperative  activity  in  the  fields  of  Intelligent  Transport  Systems   (ITS) and sustainable transport strategies.   

 We  will  cooperate  closely  on  transportation,  including  the  aviation  liberalisation   agenda in multilateral fora such as the International Civil Aviation Organization, the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  and  the  World  Trade   Organization  (General  Agreement  on  Trade  in  Services)  and  by  working  towards  a   bilateral  agreement  on  relaxing  ownership  and  control  rules,  inward  investment   opportunities,  and  opportunities  to  develop  intermodal  services  in  our  respective   markets. 

 

 With  a  view  to  facilitating  possible  later  informal  exchange  of  information  and   opinions  on  the  basis  of  a  ‘correspondence  group’,  we  will  exchange  details  of   headquarters’ officials responsible for different aspects of maritime, aviation and land  transport security.   

 

 Environment     

 On the basis of the existing framework of cooperation, we will continue to collaborate  on climate change.  In particular, specific attention could be given to:   

 technology development and deployment;   

 climate science, impacts and adaptation;   

 harmonisation  of  emissions  monitoring,  reporting,  verification  and   certification procedures; and    

 evolution of mitigation commitments.     

 We  agree  to  improve  mutual  understanding  of  our  respective  approaches  to   environment  protection  and  on  how  our  approaches  impact  on  international  policy   setting and our respective and joint interests.     

 We  will  seek  opportunities  to  cooperate  on  environmental  priorities  and  programs,   including in the broader Asia-Pacific region.   

 

 

 Development Cooperation   

 We will pursue opportunities for further collaboration in our development cooperation  programs in areas of mutual interest, including through:    

 assisting  the  recovery  and  nation-building  processes  in  East  Timor   (particularly  over  the  next  three  years)  and  in  the  Solomon  Islands;    

 gearing programs to build good governance and economic growth in nations in  the Pacific, particularly PNG; and   

 providing  support  and  funding  for  the  Asia  Pacific  Leadership  Forum  on   HIV/AIDS and Development.   

 

 Migration and Asylum    

 We  will  enhance  our  exchange  of  information  and  cooperation  on  approaches  to   manage  the  challenges  posed  by  global  people  flows,  consulting  closely  in   multilateral fora and bilaterally.  In particular, we will focus on development of policy  settings and practical cooperation with respect to:   

 asylum seeker and refugee readmission to countries of first asylum;   

 improving  capacity-building  (including  in  border  management)  in  third   countries that are of mutual interest;   

 the integration of migrants and the nexus between development and migration;    

 exchange  of  information  relevant  to  fight  people-smuggling,  human   trafficking and related transnational crime;   

 exchange  of  information  on  the  development  of  new  technologies  and   electronic support structures that could assist in combating irregular migration,  and identity and document fraud.
