 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It’s good to be here on the outskirts of Rockhampton with my friend and colleague Warren Truss, the Leader  of the National Party and the Shadow Minister for Transport also with Ken O’Dowd the Member for Flynn  and Michelle Landry the candidate for Capricornia also with leading local citizens to talk about the  Coalition’s commitment to the Bruce Highway. Now, I want to make it absolutely crystal clear that the  Bruce Highway is one of the most important roads in our country. It is the most important road in  Queensland. It is one of the most important roads in our country. It is the lifeline of Queensland. It is the  gateway to our north. For too long it has been a substandard road. The commitment that the Coalition  announced yesterday and amplifies today is about bringing this road into the 21st century.    

 It's a $6.7 billion commitment over 10 years from the Federal Coalition. All up, it's close to $10 billion by  the time you put in our Gateway Motorway money and the State Government's money, it is $2.6 billion  more than the Labor Party will spend. This is a serious commitment from a Coalition which is serious about  doing the right thing by the people of Queensland. I am particularly pleased to be here on the Yeppen Flood  Plain today to confirm that as part of our commitment to the Bruce, there will be $186 million worth of  Federal money to ensure that this flood plain is passable. Is passable.    

 We have seen many times in the last few years the road go out here, it was out for almost two weeks two  years ago. It's simply unacceptable. We had dozens and dozens and dozens of trucks with perishable goods  rotting on the side of the road. It's just not right that in a first world economy, in the 21st century, a road like  this goes out routinely every summer because it hasn't been upgraded. It will be upgraded under the  Coalition and I'm very proud to be here with Warren, with Ken and Michelle to make that absolutely crystal  clear.  

 2 

 

 

 Now, Richard Wilson and Tony Hopkins will say a few words in a minute from the perspective of local  users of the road. Warren will say a few words as will Ken and Michelle but before then I just want to add a  few observations about other subjects if I may.    

 Our commitment to the Bruce Highway is part of our plan for a stronger Australia. I have to say that's  particularly relevant here in Capricornia where government policy has been responsible for a big black cloud  over the coal industry. We will take it away. We will abolish the mining tax. We will abolish the carbon tax.  We will provide a one-stop-shop for environmental assessments. We will fully restore the Australian  Building and Construction Commission. We will make it easier for big new projects to go ahead in an  environment of relative industrial harmony and we will restore the industrial relations pendulum to the  sensible centre. So, our national economic plan will be particularly beneficial here in Capricornia where,  let's face it, one in 10 jobs is in coal and coal-related activities. I also want to make it crystal clear that what  you'll never get from the Coalition is the kind of policy making on the run which we have seen again and  again from the Rudd-Gillard Government. Day in, day out we see more evidence from the Rudd-Gillard  Government that they can change the leader, they can change the talk but they don't change the behaviour.  This is a government which dreams things up in secret, inflicts them on the public and it just causes untold  pain.    

 The latest Kevin car crash is these fringe benefit tax changes which threaten to completely derail motor  industry sales at a time when the car industry is under enormous pressure. Why is Mr Rudd hitting  aspirational people with yet another tax hike? Why is Mr Rudd so indifferent to the desires of ordinary  Australians to get ahead? Because that's exactly what this fringe benefit tax is doing. It is hitting ordinary  Australians who are just trying to get ahead. Mr Rudd doesn't get it, when it comes to our economy, he  doesn't get it, when it comes to the aspirations of ordinary Australians.    

 Finally, before I throw to Warren, Ken and Michelle, the disaster on our borders just gets worse and worse.  It just gets worse and worse. I say to Mr Rudd be man enough to admit that you got it wrong in 2008 when  you reversed the Howard Government's policies that worked. You put the people smugglers back in  business. You're the best friend they've ever had. You are now running a virtual taxi service for the people  smugglers. Be man enough to admit you got it wrong and change the policy now. There is no secret to what  we need. We need to put back in place temporary protection visas. We need to be serious about offshore  processing in places like Nauru. Most importantly, we have got to have the readiness and the willingness to  turn boats around where it's safe to do so. Mr Rudd often likes to scoff at the Coalition's position and says  "all they've got is a three word slogan 'Stop the boats.’  Well, I ask you - what do you propose to do, Mr  Rudd? Don't you think it is important to stop the boats? What do you want to do? Do you want to manage  the boats? Do you want to massage the boats? Do you want to welcome the boats? The fact of the matter is  the only acceptable outcome from Australia's perspective is to stop the boats. That is exactly what will  happen under a Coalition government.    

 So Warren, it's so good to be with you here on the outskirts of Rockhampton. Your commitment to building  a better Australia, to building a better Queensland is second to none. I want to be the infrastructure Prime  Minister should we win the election and I want you to be the infrastructure Deputy Prime Minister.    

 WARREN TRUSS:   

 Thank you very much Tony. Ken O'Dowd, Michelle Landry and ladies and gentlemen. The announcements  we are making here today are the practical examples of the local projects that are going to be constructed as  part of our commitment to build a much better Bruce Highway. That announcement yesterday as Tony has  already mentioned is a commitment to a partnership with the Queensland Government on an 80-20 basis for  $8.5 billion worth of spending over the next 10 years. Around $10 billion if you include the Gateway north  project, north of Brisbane. This is an outstanding step forward and will make a real difference to the Bruce  Highway. Now, Michelle and Ken have both been a part of the campaign that Coalition members and  candidates have been engaging to fix the Bruce now for several years. This time last year we were through 

 3 

 

 this area as a part of our drive that the whole of the Bruce Highway, which involved five or six federal  members of parliament, some of our candidates and state members, where we identified key projects where  upgrading needed to occur.   

 Now, Ken O’Dowd conducted a survey in his electorate of what were the highest priorities according to the  people of the region and so a lot of work has gone into developing the list of more than 70 projects that will  be funded as a part of this upgrade of the Bruce Highway.   

 And one project that’s being identified everywhere, at the top of the list, is the upgrading of this Yeppen  Flood Plain project behind us. This is a place where the road is cut for extended periods and this project will  be an innovative piece of engineering that will result in an elevated roadway above the flood levels so that  Rockhampton will have access to the rest of the world in flood times and that traffic can move up and down  the highway as it hasn’t been able to do as a result of flooding over recent times. So this is a substantial  project identified everywhere as one of the highest priorities.    

 But we’re also announcing new initiatives to preserve and identify and plan the proposed Rockhampton  bypass, additional work on the northern access to Rockhampton and then further projects also further south  in the electorate of Flynn that Ken O’Dowd has a particular interest in. This will make a real difference to  Rockhampton and help ensure that its access to the rest of the world, the beef capital of Australia, one of the  most important beef centres in the world, will be able to access the rest of the country, the rest of the world.  Produce will be able to get in here for processing, particularly cattle going to the meatworks in this town. All  of that produce will not be interrupted as a result of the regular rainfalls that come through this area.   

 So I’d like to thank Tony and the team for their willingness, in a difficult budgetary situation, to be able to  find the money that’s going to be necessary to do this job. This is important for the future of Australia. It’s a  vital piece of infrastructure and Rockhampton is going to share in these projects with what’s being  announced today.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well said, Warren. Ok, Ken?   

 KEN O’DOWD:   

 Well thanks Warren and Tony for coming to central Queensland. I look forward today to showing you some  of the stretches of the Bruce Highway and not only will this funding in the future help the safety of our  roads, but it’s a real economical boost for our people who use the highway on a daily basis. The truck turn  around into Brisbane will be quickened up and of course if you do that you’ll save a lot of money and the  cost of our groceries coming into Rockhampton and Gladstone and Gracemere and so on and so forth will be  so much cheaper if we can get our truck costs down and our freight bills reduced.   

 It will also serve as a continuous road through to the north, North Queensland, in wet times and also the  people of Flynn from Gracemere and Emerald along the Capricorn Highway will benefit greatly from this.  This is a large cattle producing area and we need to get our cattle to the meatworks in Rockhampton and this  hasn’t been possible in these wet times.    

 So thank you very much for coming, Tony and Warren, and I look forward to showing you the Bruce  Highway later in the day.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Thank you. Michelle?   

 MICHELLE LANDRY:

 Thank you. This announcement today is really about safety, flood and jobs. For a long time we’ve been  neglected in this area by the Labor Party. Tony and Warren have listened to our concerns about this and  have taken our advice and given us the funding to put the money into Yeppen. So we’re very, very excited  that this is going to happen. This is a very important part of the Bruce Highway. It’s, you know, it’s the  central point for the state. So it just…when this floods here, the whole of the state comes to a standstill.  Trucks have to go thousands and thousands of kilometres out of their way to get food supplies through. You  know, medical conditions with people, people in Gladstone are having to get flown in by choppers. So it’s  very, very important. So we’re very, very pleased that they have made this announcement today and we’d  like to thank you both for coming up here. Thank you.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Ok, Richard, come on in, mate.   

 RICHARD WILSON (KEPPEL BAY MARINA):   

 Thanks Tony. Now, I represent the tourism industry here. I’m from Keppel Bay Marina on the Capricorn  Coast which is the tourism hub for central Queensland we see on a daily basis Australian and International  tourists coming by and the topic of discussion is the situation with the roads and the access into this area. It  happens on a daily basis and we see it all the time. It’s a major point and we think it is such a key factor that  we’re going to get decent roads through here, we’re going to get proper access. I’m also a cattle producer  and we can safely get our cattle through to the abattoirs too, that is a tremendous step forward and it is so  essential for the economy of this area.    

 And one further one, we also have another highway and that’s the water highway and we get boats coming  into our marina and heading north. Unfortunately the Defence Department closed that highway for six or  eight weeks at the time of the year. If only they would close it when they were live firing, that trade, that  tourism trade, would be much, much stronger too. Thank you.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Thanks Richard. Tony?   

 TONY HOPKINS (HOPKINS TRANSPORT AND NATIONAL ROAD FREIGHTERS  ASSOCIATION):   

 I’m Tony Hopkins. I’m the Director of the National Road Freighters Association and I thank Tony Abbott  and Warren Truss for their commitment to the highway and to the transport industry. The Bruce Highway is  vital to the input of Queensland and has been neglected for over 30 years, in my belief, and I really  appreciate that we are going to have a voice in Michelle in the transport industry, and through Warren and  Tony. Thank you.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Thanks so much. Ok, do we have any questions today?   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, regarding the Refugee Convention. Do you think that needs to be looked at again?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 5 

 

 I think we need to stop the boats and that’s what we need to do and that means action by Australia and Mr  Rudd’s latest suggestion that he will travel the world seeking to change the Refugee Convention is just  another distraction from the fact that he can’t stop the boats. He started the boats, he can’t stop them and  sure, he wants to be in the front of the 747 traveling the world, engaging in meeting after meeting after  meeting, talking about the problem, not fixing the problem. The solutions to this problem lie essentially in  Australia and on our borders and I call on Mr Rudd to put them into place.   

 QUESTION:   

 So do you have any concerns about the Refugee Convention? Do you have any concerns yourself?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look the difficulty with the convention is the way it’s been imported into Australian law. That’s the  difficulty. It’s the things that we do here in Australia as Australians that matter. We should get cracking on  doing what we need to in this country and on our borders to fix this problem, not raise yet another red  herring which is Mr Rudd leading some kind of an international crusade to change an international rule.   

 QUESTION:   

 Do you think that’s a ploy, to try and redefine, sorry, the term of a refugee to, I don’t know, assist him here  in getting [inaudible]?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Mr Rudd is always trying to internationalise problems and that’s an excuse for inaction here in Australia. I  say to Mr Rudd: stop making excuses, stop trying to say this is the world’s problem. It’s not, it’s our  problem. We need to take the appropriate action in this country, by this country, for this country, to stop the  boats and we need to do it now.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, why is the Government’s ETS, you’re classifying it as a tax and yet at the same time you’re  classifying your paid parental leave scheme as a levy even though it has huge imposts on business?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well as you know, our intention is to introduce the paid parental leave scheme at the same time as we reduce  company tax so that no business should face a net increase in tax and if we can do what we hope to, many  businesses that are currently paying decent paid parental leave schemes will actually be significantly better  off as a result of our change.   

 QUESTION:   

 That sounds like the exact same argument used by the Government in relation to the carbon tax. Is yours a  tax or not?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I am not going to quibble over words. What I am saying though is that under us, my firm intention is  that there will be no net increase in the tax paid by business, because I understand in a way that Mr Rudd  doesn't that lower tax is the way forward, less regulation is the way forward, a stronger private sector is the  way forward. Mr Rudd thinks that the answer to every problem is more government spending, more  government regulation and more government bureaucrats.

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott why have we seen this real spike in boats - even in just the last few days. What are you getting  the word back on what's causing it?    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Plainly the people smugglers are taking advantage of weakness on the part of the Australian Government  and as each passing day makes clearer and clearer that the Government has no plans, no answers, no will to  act differently, the people smugglers are in a sense laughing all the way to the bank. Now it is a sad, sad  thing to have our country taken advantage of like this. It is a tragic thing to have this evil trade flourishing  because as we know, as long as the boats keep coming, the deaths will keep happening. That is why it's not  just the right thing to do to stop the boats it’s the compassionate thing to do, to stop the boats.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, where is this extra $2.6 billion for the Bruce coming from? Does the lack of a Cross River Rail  offer from the Coalition factor into it?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, as I said yesterday, it will be funded in part from money that's already allocated in the forward  estimates. It will be funded in part from the Building Australia Fund. It will be funded in part from the  savings in the Budget and in part from the stronger economy that will be produced by the Coalition in the  years ahead should we win government.   

 QUESTION:   

 If that doesn't happen are you 100 per cent committed to this extra $2.6 billion?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Absolutely. Absolutely committed.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, the biggest challenge that locals have is it can take nine hours to drive to Brisbane and the reason  for that is road works, which indicates that a lot of work is being done and has been over a significant period  of time. The Labor Government has committed more money to the Bruce Highway as you have so why is  your plan better?    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well our plan involves $2.6 billion more than Labor's. That is $2.6 billion reasons to vote for the Coalition  as opposed to the Labor Party if your concern is to fix the Bruce Highway.   

 QUESTION:   

 In terms for the projects for this region, the list promised by Labor and the list promised by the Coalition  seem pretty identical. What’s the difference?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 7 

 

 Well that’s not true. If you go to the second last page of the policy document that we released yesterday,  there’s I think from memory a couple of dozen projects that are funded under us and are not funded under  the ALP.   

 WARREN TRUSS:   

 Can I just add one thing to that by way of the answer as well - we have a partnership with the Queensland  Government for 80/20 funding. The Federal Labor Government is still insisting on 50/50 funding and the  States don't have that money. So there are real questions about whether the promises Labor is making it will  in fact be able to honour.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Joel?   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott you said yesterday that the deaths of the asylum seekers are on Mr Kevin Rudd’s hands. If there  was potential sinking of a boat being towed back, would that be on your hands?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, I am not sure that I was quite as explicit as you're suggesting. But the point I make is that we simply  have to take the necessary action to ensure that this evil trade is closed down and the boats stop coming. The  longer the boats keep coming, the more people will die and if we are genuinely compassionate towards these  unfortunate people, we will stop the boats. Now sometimes, in the pursuit of what is a just and fair outcome,  unfortunate things happen. Police every day have to do their job and sometimes in the course of doing their  job, some unfortunate things happen. That is not the police's fault. That is the criminal's fault and if there are  any tragedies that take place as a result of the Coalition's attempts rightly and fairly to stop the boats, well  that is on the head of the people smugglers, that is on the head of the people who are doing the wrong thing  by this country and ultimately doing the wrong thing by the people who they're exploiting.   

 QUESTION:   

 [Inaudible]   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 The problem on our borders has been caused by the policy changes that Mr Rudd put in place back in 2008.  Sure, other countries have their own problems. But our problem is the responsibility, I regret to say, of our  Government. Let's never forget John Howard found a problem and crafted a solution. Kevin Rudd found a  solution and created a problem because Kevin Rudd was not man enough to leave well enough alone. That is  why we have the problem, or as President Yudhoyono has said, Australia needs to take the sugar off the  table. And the sugar that is currently on the table is the result of this Government's policies, which  essentially mean if you can get here you can stay here. It's not good enough Mr Rudd, it is just not good  enough. I say we will stop the boats. What do you say? What do you say?    

 QUESTION:   

 Do you think the fact that there have been deaths lately will discourage more people from coming?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 8 

 

 Well, the point I make is that Mr Rudd's now been the Prime Minister again for over three weeks. In that  time, we've seen rescues almost every day. We have seen tragedies almost every week and we are now  racing to what looks like being another monthly record for illegal boat arrivals and all Mr Rudd can do is  talk, that is all he can do. He can get on a plane, he can go overseas. He can have a signing ceremony but  none of this will actually stop the boats because deep down Labor is incapable of stopping the boats. Labor  is incapable of stopping the boats because it is too much enthralled to the Greens. It is too much enthralled  to certain activists who basically think that this country can somehow be a life boat for the world. Well, we  can't. We will play our part. We will do our fair share. We will always be a generous country but we are not  going to be taken for a ride by people smugglers, not now, not ever. And certainly not when a Coalition  government is in charge.    

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, just about FBT before you go. How many ordinary Australian do you think are going to be angry  now that they've realised this has been slipped through? They have worked to that stage in their life where  they have got a car and now there’s going to be a fair whack.    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, typically this Government has cooked this up in secret. It hasn't consulted with anyone and now it's  discovering that the consequences are quite different for those - from those that it imagined. Yesterday, the  Government said that this would basically impact on rich people driving BMWs - wrong, wrong, wrong. It's  nurses driving a Camry, it's charity workers in Falcons, it's salesmen in Holdens - these are the people who  are going to be impacted by these changes for hundreds of thousands of people, most of them earning not  much more or even less in many cases than average weekly earnings. This is something like a $1,200 a year  tax hike or endless paperwork that most of them simply won't do. It's yet another administrative disaster  from a Government which is much better at putting out press releases, much better at media manipulation,  much better at sordid politics than it is at actually getting on and governing the country.
