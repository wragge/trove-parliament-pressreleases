 Kevin Andrews MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 DIAC outreach officers to visit Wollongong  Officers from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) will be in  Wollongong this month for a regional outreach visit. 

 Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Kevin Andrews said the outreach  trips were a great way for people in regional areas to sit down and talk about  immigration-related issues face-to-face with DIAC officers. 

 'The Australian Government places great importance on providing services to  regional areas and these visits are a large part of that,’ Mr Andrews said. 

 ‘These appointments attract a range of people, from small business owners to  farmers, community groups to individuals, who might want information or just  someone to talk them through a complex matter. 

 ‘While the department has a great deal of information available over the  phone or on the Internet, some people prefer to speak to officers face-to-face,  and these visits are about meeting that need. 

 ‘In the past, the most popular topics related to citizenship, work visas, visas  for family members and how to propose and sponsor refugees,’ the Minister  added. 

 The DIAC team will be at the Illawarra Multicultural Services building, 27  Atchison Street, Wollongong on Tuesday, October 16. 

 Consultations will take place from 10am to 4.30pm. Bookings should be made  through Illawarra Multicultural Services on 4229 6855.
