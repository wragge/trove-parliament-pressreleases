 Ellison’s gaffe underscores government disarray over West  Papua - Brown   

 11th Apr 06 

 

 Justice Minister Ellison has made a serious gaffe in advocating that  Canberra consult Jakarta over the bona fides of fleeing West  Papuans, Greens leader Bob Brown said today.    

 “The Howard Government is in disarray over West Papua with  proclamations, one after another, that add to the average  Australian’s alarm that we are not standing by the West Papuans’  basic human and democratic rights.    

 “Chris Ellison doesn’t understand global refugee laws which aim to  prevent retribution on family and friends if an asylum seeker’s  identity is revealed. Brendan Nelson’s Darwin proposal of joint 

 Indonesian-Australian naval patrols to repel fleeing West Papuans  and the Prime Minister’s flagging intervening foreign policy  considerations to compromise the West Papuans refugee rights,  underscores the government’s intention to break long established  global laws,” Senator Brown said.    

 “This is either a shemozzle or John Howard has signalled to Cabinet  he is prepared to compromise Australia’s regard for the law to curry  favour with the Indonesian government. This is a dangerous drift 

 and, while it will be welcome in Jakarta, it will be very unpopular  here in Australia,” Senator Brown said.    

 Mr Howard should hold the line on three issues:  

 â¢ upholding international laws on the rights of refugees;  

 â¢ opposing the abuse, including killing and torture, of West 

 Papuans by the Indonesian military; and   â¢ supporting a democratic outcome for the West Papuans, 

 Senator Brown said.
