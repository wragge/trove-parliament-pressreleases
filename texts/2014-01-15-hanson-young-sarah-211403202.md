 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 15 January 2014   

 Secrecy increases as Friday briefings canned   

 The Coalition Government’s reign of secrecy has become even more restrictive after the Immigration  Minister’s confirmation that his farcical Friday briefings have come to an end, the Australian Greens  have said.   

 “The Immigration Minister is making up the rules as he goes along in a desperate attempt to avoid  embarrassment,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Refusing to face questioning and politicising the Defence Force by hiding behind a military general  is unbecoming conduct from the Abbott Government.   

 “The Prime Minister is waging a war against refugees and the Australian people’s right to know. This  is just more secrecy from a shifty and arrogant Abbott Government.   

 “The constantly changing rules and the unprecedented level of secrecy is concerning. If the  government has nothing to hide, why is it so desperate to keep the public in the dark?”
