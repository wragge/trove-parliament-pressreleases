 Victoria proves popular for migrants 

 27 December 2006 

 The number of migrants choosing to settle in Victoria continues to increase, with settler  numbers at their highest since the Coalition came to government. 

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Amanda Vanstone today said 32 297 migrants  settled in Victoria in 2005-2006, 1716 more than the previous year. 

 ‘Victoria has always been an attractive destination for migrants seeking to start a fresh life and  the statistics show that desire has not changed,’ Senator Vanstone said. 

 ‘The Victorian community is to be congratulated for welcoming these people into their lives so  readily and willingly.’ 

 India was the largest contributor of new settlers with 4295 people beginning their new life in  Victoria in 2005-2006, while more than 3500 British settlers, 3142 Chinese and 624 Iraqis  made the state their new home. 

 On the national front, more than 131 000 people arrived and settled in Australia in 2005-2006,  an increase of about 8000 on the previous year. 

 The largest number of settlers came from the United Kingdom with 23 290, up by about 5000  on last year. 

 Other European countries contributed about 7000 migrants, while the number of new arrivals  from Sudan fell almost 2000 from the last year to 3783. 

 Iraqi arrival numbers were up almost 500 to 2425, while more than 52 000 people from 34  Asian countries made Australia their new home during 2005-2006. 

 Senator Vanstone said the majority of new arrivals entered Australia through the family and  skill streams of the migration programme. 

 ‘Our migration target for 2006-2007 is about 140 000, including 97 500 in the skill stream and  that number does not include the 13 000 refugee and humanitarian entrants who will begin  new lives in Australia through our humanitarian programme.’ 

 The full list of statistics can be found in Settler Arrivals 2005-2006, a Department of  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs publication that has been published on its website at  www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/index.htm.
