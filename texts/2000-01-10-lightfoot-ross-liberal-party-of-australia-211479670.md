  MEDIA RELEASE

  SENATOR ROSS LIGHTFOOT

  LIBERAL SENATOR FOR WESTERN AUSTRALIA

  

 10 January 2000

  

  WORRIED ABOUT YOUR WIFE AND CHILDREN? GO HOME 
AND CHECK!

  

  Following public criticism of illegal immigrants accepting generous 
taxpayer funded handouts last week , Senator for Western Australia 
Ross Lightfoot has again hit out at the new arrivals.

  

 Despite his strong support for the introduction of 
a limited three year visa. Senator Lightfoot has variously described 
the illegal arrivals as queue-jumpers, criminals and law-breakers as 
well as possible carriers of communicable disease. He makes it clear 
that he would prefer to see the immigrants returned to their last port 
of embarkation.

  

 Senator Lightfoot blames the ALP and Democrats for 
undermining stricter guidelines and proposed legislation by the Minister 
for Immigration, The Hon Philip Ruddock.

  

 ‘It is scandalous that the balance of the Senate 
gives the ALP arid Democrats the power to veto legislation that so obviously 
has the support endorsement & the wider community. It is even more 
immoral for them to use their power to the financial detriment of the 
Australian taxpayer,” Senator Lightfoot said.

  

 Responding to claims that Australia has an international 
obligation to give safe haven to refugees, Senator Lightfoot said. ". 
...we simply cannot become the refuge for all of the world's troubled, 
dispossessed or religious zealots, who see Australia as a natural haven.”

  

 Senator Lightfoot’s office has been inundated with 
calls of support for his stance from the general public. The primary 
concern of most callers is the large number of migrants from a specific 
cultural and religious background.

  

 “There is genuine fear among Australians.

  

 'There is a perception that these people bring with 
them, their prejudices and intolerances and the expectation that our 
traditionally democratic, English-speaking nation should unconditionally 
accept the disparity between our cultures has upset and antagonised 
many Australians, including those who have legitimately immigrated.” 
Senator Lightfoot said.

  

 Senator Lightfoot also commented on media reports 
that some refugees faced a future of fear due to lack of English, their 
inability to pay rental bonds and criticism from them that their visas 
will not permit them to sponsor their family members.

  

 “Several of our callers have questioned the morality 
of some of the male refugees for abandoning their wives and children 
in their poverty stricken war-torn countries and for using their families’ 
lifesavings to escape to a life of comparative comfort.

  

  If they are so traumatised by not knowing whether their families are 
alive slowly starving or already dead, I would suggest that they take 
the first plane home to find out,” Senator Lightfoot said.
