 Media Release:

 Centrelink program helps  Blacktown locals get online

 7 March 2013

 Ms Michelle Rowland MP

 Member for Greenway

 Blacktown Centrelink officer Sarjoh Bah has developed a new training 

 program to help newly arrived migrants and refugees learn computer  skills, get online and connect to essential Government services.

 Minister for Human Services Senator Kim Carr said Sarjoh's story  illustrated how the Department of Human Services was providing practical  help at a local level across the country. 

 "This is a fine example of an officer who has taken the initiative to work  with his community to find out what they really need, and how the  Government can help in a practical way," Senator Kim Carr said.

 "This isn't a one-size fits all program - it is tailored to the needs of  Blacktown locals, and you won't find another one exactly like it in 

 Australia." 

 Member for Greenway Michelle Rowland said the program is particularly 

 important in Blacktown with over 32 per cent of the local population  coming from over 180 countries and speaking more than 154 languages.

 "Computer literacy and knowing how to access Government services  online can help new migrants to find work, access essential services and  settle more quickly into Australia," Ms Rowland said.

 "Students learn about government assistance, why it's important and how  they can access services independently online - skills that play an  important role in their settlement in Australia."

 Local Multicultural Service Officer Sarjoh Bah, who developed the  program, said the intention was to build students' confidence in accessing 

 Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support services online.

 "The program is delivered over one month as part of Adult Migrant English  Program at Macquarie Community College," Mr Bah said.

 "47 students have been involved in the course so far and most of those  taking part have had limited access to computers and come from a 

 background where there is strong mistrust of government.

 "The course has given people the information and skills they need to 

 navigate the wide range of Government services available to them."

 "Centrelink is not just an agency that makes payments. It is part of a  Department whose specialist officers are second to none. Multicultural  Service Officers, Community Engagement Officers, Social Workers - these  people are part of their local community, and they're here to help,"  Senator Kim Carr said. 

 More information about the wide range of multicultural support services  and products delivered by the Department of Human Services is available
