 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 5 BOAT ARRIVALS IN 48 HOURS UNDER  LABOR November 04, 2012

 In the last 48 hours we have seen 5 boats, carrying over 300 people, arrive illegally on Australia’s shores, Shadow  Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “This unrelenting rate of boat arrivals continues to increase this Labor Government,” Mr Keenan said

 “With over 14,000 people having been smuggled successfully across Australia’s borders this year alone, it is clear that  Labor does not have the necessary resolve to address this crisis of their own making.

 “The boats will continue to come whilst Labor continue to offer incentives that emboldened the people smugglers.

 "The greatest incentive being the continued ability for people smugglers to sell permanent residence to Australia - an  issue that a return to temporary protection visas would address.

 "The Coalition has a proven track record of stopping the boats because we have always taken a tough stance on border  protection - something Labor previously vilified us for doing. 

 “It will take a change in Government to shut down this insidious trade in human misery and remove the control of  Australia’s borders from the hands of the people smugglers,” Mr Keenan said.
