 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 26 September 2001  MEDIA RELEASE                          01/564

 Democrats: Human rights defender denied entry; human rights abuser welcomed The Australian Democrats have strongly condemned the overnight decision of the Minister for Immigration to deny human rights campaigner, Peter Tatchell, a visa to attend a public speaking event in Brisbane, this coming Friday.

 “This decision is particular repugnant considering President Robert Mugabe, a known human rights abuser, is being granted admission to Australia to attend CHOGM, in early October,” said the Australian Democrats Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett.

 “Based on advice received yesterday, from the organisers of the Brisbane event, my office made repeated representations to the Minister’s office with respect to Mr Tatchell’s visa.

 “On each of these occasions my staff was informed that Mr Tatchell’s visa was still under consideration.”

 Senator Bartlett said, “This was obviously not the case. The Minister and his staff were simply delaying the inevitable, which was to disallow Mr Tatchell’s visa, under Section 501, of the Migration Act, which empowers the Minister to refuse entry on the grounds of criminal behaviour and bad character.

 “Mr Tatchell is neither a criminal nor a man of bad character, rather he is a defender of human rights and civil liberties, but this appears to be most unpalatable to the Howard Government.”

 “The Australian Government has the followed on from its position on refugees to disallow an international human rights campaigner access to our shores,” concluded Senator Bartlett.  ENDS
