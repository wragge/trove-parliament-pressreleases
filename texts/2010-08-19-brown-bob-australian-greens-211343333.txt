 Australian Greens Leader Bob Brown said the incredible buzz around the Melbourne  campaign meant he would stay extra time in the city to campaign. 

 "I have never enjoyed being in Melbourne so much," said Senator Brown at a Greens rally  which brought a colourful and excited crowd to Fitzroy's Whitlam Place. 

 "There is a great feeling here and it is very pro-Green," Senator Brown said. 

 "Issues like same-sex marriage, saving Australia's magnificent forests, asylum seekers and  the Greens' proposal for Denticare have galvanised people like never before. 

 "Adam Bandt, if elected, will make history by becoming the first Greens candidate elected to  the House of Representatives in a general election. 

 "Dr. Richard Di Natale if elected will give Victorians their first Greens Senator."
