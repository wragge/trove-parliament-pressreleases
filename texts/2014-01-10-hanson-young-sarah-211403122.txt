 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 10 January 2014   

 Government secrecy to be challenged in Greens’  Senate Inquiry   

 The Australian Greens say that an upcoming Senate Inquiry into the government’s refusal to reveal  information about asylum seeker boat interception and tow-backs will help to bring an end to the  Coalition’s unacceptable obsession with secrecy. 

 “The days of the government’s secrecy are numbered,” Senator Hanson-Young said. 

 “Our inquiry will expose what really underpins the Coalition’s Operation Secret Boats. The  government’s thin excuse that transparency is not in the public interest is absurd and it needs to be  challenged. 

 “The Senate has made it very clear to the Government that this level of secrecy is unacceptable. The  Australian people deserve to know what exactly is happening on the high seas and what our brave  service men and women are being asked to do. 

 “The government is choosing what it wants to hide from the public and what it doesn’t on a day to  day basis. Protecting itself from scrutiny while putting our Navy and Customs personnel in danger is  a low act from the Abbott Government. 

 “It’s ridiculous that we’re currently finding out more form the Indonesian Military and media than  we are from our own Government.”
