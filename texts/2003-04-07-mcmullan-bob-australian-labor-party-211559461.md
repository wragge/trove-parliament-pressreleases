 GOVERNMENT MUST COME CLEAN ON DEFENCE BUDGET   

 The Treasurer, Peter Costello, should produce a separate detailed statement in the Budget  explaining the additional costs of Australia’s contribution to the war in Iraq, both in 2002-03  and in 2003-04.   

 Unless he does this, Australians will be entitled to assume he is using the fog of war to cover  his lack of a domestic agenda.   

 The government should answer these questions:   

 â¢ What will be the extra cost of the war in 2002-03?   

 â¢ Will there be any extra cost of the war in 2003-04, and if so, doesn’t this mean the  government believes the war will go beyond 1 July, 12 weeks away?   

 â¢ If the war is not expected to last this long, why will there be significant extra costs in   2003-04?   

 â¢ If the cost of the military deployment to the Gulf will fall in 2003-04, why can’t the  Treasurer who has collected more taxes than any other Treasurer in Australian history  afford a tax cut for Australian families by 30 June next year?   

 Estimates of the extra cost of the war on the Budget should be identified separately in the  Budget papers to allow the government’s fiscal management and domestic agenda to be  adequately assessed.
