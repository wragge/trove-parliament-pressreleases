 MEDIA RELEASE 

 The Hon Bruce Billson MP  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs        

 AA 04 068           Wednesday 25 August 2004                    

 

                               Australia to help fly aid workers into Sudan 

 

 Australia will provide $1 million to the World Food Programme (WFP) to help fly aid  workers into western Sudan to deliver emergency assistance for refugees, the Parliamentary  Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Mr Bruce Billson, announced today.    

 ‘This contribution will support the UN humanitarian air service, managed by the WFP, to  get workers into difficult areas to help refugees from Darfur. This funding will also help  provide temporary offices and accommodation for WFP workers,’ Mr Billson said.   

 ‘Poor road infrastructure, the rainy season and the remoteness of Darfur and the border area  of Chad have made transport a major challenge and our contribution will help ensure people  in need receive assistance.     

 ‘Many Australians with a broad range of expertise are also on the ground in Sudan and Chad  working with Australian non-government organisations and UN agencies,’ Mr Billson said.   

 ‘These Australians are helping to deliver important services and manage the critical  transport and distribution of essential food aid to people in refugee camps.   

 ‘With AusAID support, four Australian Red Cross workers are providing assistance in  health and sanitation and 10 engineers from RedR Australia, which sends Australians to  assist with international humanitarian operations, will build classrooms for children and  toilets for the refugees,’ Mr Billson said.   

 ‘More than one million people have been left homeless by the violence and almost 200,000  refugees have crossed the border into Chad.     

 ‘Although this allocation of $1 million to the WFP completes Australia’s commitment of  $20 million to the crisis in Sudan, Australia stands ready to consider further assistance for  humanitarian priorities.   

 ‘The Australian Government welcomes the UN Security Council resolution on Darfur, and  we continue to urge the Sudanese Government to fulfill commitments made to the UN on 3  July to address the humanitarian, human rights and security situation,’ Mr Billson said.
