 MEDIA CENTRE 

 Minister Dismisses Four Corners Allegations 

 MPS 35/2003 

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock,  today dismissed many of the issues raised on this week's Four Corners program as  outdated and unfounded. 

 Mr Ruddock said a large part of the program rehashed allegations that were previously  extensively aired in late 2000. 

 'For the Opposition and minor parties to assert that this week's Four Corners program  brought to light "new evidence" about the mismanagement of Woomera shows their  ignorance at best or is deliberately misleading. 

 'To continue to recycle these unsubstantiated stories time and time again does not make  them correct. 

 'In response to allegations about the sexual assault on a 12 year old boy I initiated an  inquiry, undertaken by Mr Philip Flood to, among other things, determine if there were  any instances of failure to follow appropriate procedures,' the Minister said. 

 'At the same time Family and Youth Services in South Australia and the South Australian  Police undertook a thorough investigation of the specific allegations regarding the boy. 

 'Neither Mr Flood's inquiry nor those of Family and Youth Services and the South  Australian Police found any evidence to substantiate the highly publicised allegations.  

 'The boy in question and his father were left without any recourse to defend themselves  against a vicious campaign of vilification by refugee advocates aided and abetted by the  media.' 

 The Minister said that in relation to other allegations in the program he had asked his  department to examine, as a matter of urgency, any contractual issues that may have  arisen. 

 'However, it is clear that the nature of the contract is not understood by the people  making the allegations - there is no contractual requirement for ACM to provide staffing  numbers to DIMIA,' Mr Ruddock said. 

 'Under the contract with ACM, the Department's focus is on outcomes. Services are to be  provided in accordance with the Immigration Detention Standards.

 'My expectation is that ACM has sufficient staff and adjusts staff levels to manage the  needs of detainees at any given time. Staff numbers will fluctuate as do numbers of  detainees.' 

 The Minister said neither he nor his Department had asserted that 'incident reports' had  never existed as Ms Gillard has claimed.  

 'In fact thousands of these incident reports have been provided to the Ombudsman as  part of their inquiry into detention processes and many hundreds provided to the HREOC,'  Mr Ruddock said.  

 The success of the Government's strong action to prevent illegal people smuggling is clear  for all to see: 

  z no people having their lives put at risk in leaky boats for nearly 18 months, 

  z a dramatic reduction in the number of people in detention. 

  Despite the desire for commentators and the ALP to rewrite history the Government  stands by it's achievements and does not resile from the difficult task it has had to  perform.
