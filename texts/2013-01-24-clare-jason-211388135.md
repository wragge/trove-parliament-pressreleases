 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Border Protection Command transfers asylum seekers   

 24 January 2013 

 

 ACV Ocean Protector, operating under the control of Border Protection Command,  has worked with Oil and Gas Installation (OGI) support vessel Offshore Quest,  approximately 92 nautical miles east-south-east of Ashmore Islands, to transfer  eleven suspected asylum seekers into Australian Government custody.   

 Yesterday the Offshore Quest contacted the Australian Maritime Safety Authorityâ€™s  Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC Australia) to report that passengers from a small  Indonesian fishing vessel had boarded the vessel.   

 On receipt of the information from RCC Australia, the ACV Ocean Protector was  tasked.   

 Overnight, the eleven passengers were embarked on to the ACV Ocean Protector.    

 The passengers will be transferred to Australian Government authorities on  Christmas Island where they will undergo identity checks and their reasons for travel  will be established.   

 People arriving by boat without a visa after 13 August 2012 run the risk of transfer to  a regional processing country.
