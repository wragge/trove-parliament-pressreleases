 Media Release - 10 January 2014 

 Clive Palmer seeks to visit Christmas Island detention  centre  The federal leader of the Palmer United Party and Member for Fairfax Clive Palmer will write to 

 Immigration Minister Scott Morrison seeking approval to visit the Christmas Island detention centre. 

 Mr Palmer said he was determined to ensure the children of asylum seekers were not denied a happy 

 childhood just because their parents had been forced to seek refuge in Australia. 

 “I have always believed that keeping children behind bars was wrong but the birth of my daughter Lucy 

 last month has renewed by commitment to these kids,” Mr Palmer said. 

 “Whether they took this dangerous voyage with their parents, or were born in detention, every child 

 deserves a safe and loving upbringing with a range of experiences, not just the inside of a cell or an 

 exercise yard.” 

 Last year, a delegation of Palmer United Party federal election candidates undertook a fact finding mission 

 to Christmas Island. 

 Mr Palmer said he had made a New Year’s resolution to personally visit Christmas Island this year. 

 The Palmer United Party advocates allowing asylum seekers to fly to Australia and be quickly processed at 

 airports. 

 Mr Palmer said offshore processing as favoured by both major parties had increased the pain and suffering 

 of genuine asylum seekers.
