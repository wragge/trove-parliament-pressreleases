  Government 
must do better on Multiculturalism

  The Australian Democrats have 
welcomed the establishment of the Multicultural Develo  pment Association-Migrant Service Agency which was 
officially opened in South Brisbane today.

  Democrat Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew 
Bartlett, said "It’s good to see another organisation that will 
contribute positively to Multiculturalism. With continued migration 
to Brisbane and Queensland the need for such services can only increase."

  However, Senator Bartlett said the Government had 
a lot more to do to demonstrate it was serious about supporting multiculturalism.

  "The Democrats have become concerned at the 
lack of political support of multiculturalism in recent times."

  "Recent attacks on ethnic communities, refugees 
and migrants are very concerning. There is an increasing emphasis by 
government on the economic benefits of immigration. At the same time 
Governments neglect the social benefits that multiculturalism continues 
to bring to Australia. 

  "Effectively, the government has taken the family 
out of immigration and by doing so it has undermined the principles 
which have underlined multiculturalism for so long. 

  Senator Bartlett said Multiculturalism is highly 
dependent on communities that consist of family units. It is dependent 
on the retention of traditions from those migrant communities and the 
blending of these traditions with the Australian way of life.

  "Changes that began with the introduction of 
the two-year waiting period for benefits were followed by others including 
limiting preferential family sponsorship rights to Australian citizens, 
the introduction of rigorous assessment of spouse and defacto visas, 
the balance of family test for parents and the introduced English skill 
test for migrants. 

  "All of these changes have radically effected 
the mix of migrants eligible to enter Australia. 

  "The rhetoric and the message from the Government 
implies that migrants no longer contribute, that they drain resources. 
The clear message sent by Government is that young, qualified, English-speaking 
migrants are the only ones who don’t drain resources and therefore 
they should be encouraged above everyone else," said Senator Bartlett. 

  "The Government rhetoric is that economic value 
now far outweighs family values.

  "The Democrats reject such rhetoric and strongly 
reiterate their support for a genuinely multicultural society," 
concluded Senator Bartlett.
