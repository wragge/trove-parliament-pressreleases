 JOINT PRESS RELEASE   

 SENATOR THE HON GEORGE BRANDIS QC  ATTORNEY-GENERAL  THE HON PETER DUTTON MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION  ________________________________________________________________________________ 

 15 February 2016 

 VISIT TO WASHINGTON DC 

 

 Today the Attorney-General and the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection will  travel to Washington DC to attend the Quintet of Attorneys General and Five Country  Ministerial meeting.    

 I  t is the first time these series of meetings are being held jointly, highlighting the importance  of close collaboration and cooperation with our security and intelligence partners - the United  King

  dom, Canada, New Zealand and the United States - in responding to increased global  se 

 curity threats.   

 The Attorney-General will share Australia’s experience in working to balance the rule of law  with individual liberties at a time when Australia faces a range of complex and evolving  threats to national security.   

 While in Washington DC, the Attorney-General will have bilateral meetings with his  counterparts, meet with the Director of the CIA, Director of the FBI, Director of National  Intelligence, Director of the National Counterterrorism Centre and the Assistant for the  President on Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, to discuss efforts to combat violent  e

  xtremism and stop the growth of ISIL.   

 This Five Country Ministerial (FCM) meeting is an opportunity for the Minister for  Immigration and Border Protection to cement immigration and border protection cooperation  as a key part of the broader national security dialogue under the Five Country arrangements.  Talks will focus on issues including enhancing the facilitation of legitimate travellers through  mec

  hanisms such as trusted traveller programmes and improved visa processes.    

 All Five Country partners are facing similar global challenges of terrorism, foreign fighters,  and the illegal movement of people and goods. Australia, as a priority, will seek support from  the  

 group to leverage its combined capabilities through enhanced information and intelligence  exchange. This includes discussing the long-term objective of 100 per cent collection and  shar 

 ing of biometric information to maintain the integrity of our borders.    

 The



  Five Country partners will discuss how they can better work together to ensure that  re  fugees are processed as efficiently and effectively as possible, through  enhanced  information sharing for visa and refugee screening purposes.

 Recent terrorist attacks and failed plots around the world reinforce how vital it is for Australia  to work closely with our security and intelligence partners internationally, and to share  Austra 

 lia’s experiences and approaches in combatting the threat from extremists. Resolving  the te  nsion between maximising personal freedoms and protecting public safety is a  continuing objective of all democracies.    

 The   Minister for Immigration and Border Protection will also meet the US Secretary for  Home

  land Security, US Customs and Border Protection Service, and Immigration and  Customs Enforcement. He will also participate in  bilateral meetings with his United  Kingdom, Canadian and New Zealand counterparts.
