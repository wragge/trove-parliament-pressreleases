 SENATOR THE HON DOUG CAMERON  SHADOW MINISTER FOR HUMAN SERVICES  SENATOR FOR NEW SOUTH WALES    

 

 E&OE TRANSCRIPT  SENATE DOORSTOP  CANBERRA  TUESDAY, 17 MARCH 2015  SUBJECT/ S: Joe Hockey’s Bumbling Q&A Performance; M etadata  Retention; Asylum Seekers.  DOUG CAMERON, SHADOW MINISTER FOR HUMAN SERVICES: I must  say I was a bit appalled by Joe Hockey’s performance last night on Q&A where  he said he was always concerned about spending other people’s money.  Well I don’t know where he was when he was taking money out of the back  pocket of pensioners, when he was taking the money out of ordinary families,  when he was doing very little to increase tax for his big business mates - this  guy is a hypocrite and that bumbling performance last night just demonstrates  this government is completely out of touch.  Joe Hockey is just - in my view - completely out of his depth as Treasurer of this  country.  That Budget is still not through Parliament and we’re heading for another  Budget.  It’s alright kicking back with the Havanas after you’ve delivered a Budget that  takes money out of the pockets of the struggling families of this country and  then go on Q&A and talk about ‘not taking money out of the pocket of ordinary  people’.  Well he should listen to his own advice now and again and this is to ensure that  ordinary people in this country get a fair go.  Nobody trusts this government. Nobody can trust Joe Hockey.  Nobody can trust a government that says one thing and does another.  I thought the performance last night was absolutely pathetic.  JOURNALIST: Are you concerned that a court could get a warrant and a  journalist would have to reveal their sources under the metadata legislation? 

 CAMERON: Well this is an issue that will be discussed at the Labor Party caucus  this morning. So I will be interested to hear the reports on that and I will reserve  my judgment on this until I hear reports from the caucus and the Shadow  Attorney General.  JOURNALIST: What are your concerns about it?  CAMERON: I’ll wait until I hear the report of the Shadow Attorney General.  JOURNALIST: Are you concerned though there could be the shaping up of  Labor to not go ahead with the Parliamentary inquiry because presumably there’s  nothing wrong with accepting the amendment but still going ahead with the  inquiry?  CAMERON: Well look there’s one thing that Labor will do and that is Labor will  ensure the safety of the Australian public. That is fundamental in anything that  we do. We are obviously concerned to ensure that the public are safe. That’s the  decision that we’ve taken in the last period of time and we’ve put that first and  foremost. Thanks.  JOURNALIST: On refugees, are you concerned that a refugee will have to  prove that there’s a greater than 50 per cent chance that (inaudible)?  CAMERON: Well I think my position on refugees is well known. I think we need  to treat refugees with humanity. We need to ensure that if they are in detention  that that detention means they are safe, their children are safe and that we’ve  got a regional process to ensure that this problem goes away as much as we  can. This will not be resolved until there’s a regional framework for dealing with  refugees and short term, knee jerk reactions don’t cut it for this problem.  JOURNALIST: If someone hands in one wrong document for their application  for asylum their application can be rejected out of hand.  CAMERON: Well what I’ve said is that I think refugees and asylum seekers  should be treated with humanity, they should be treated with dignity and we  should ensure that they are treated with fairness, so that’s the position that I  take in all my discussions on this issue and that’s the position that I would be  adopting.
