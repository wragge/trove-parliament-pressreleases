 Kevin Andrews MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 

 

 Citizenship legislation, Sri Lankan unauthorised boat  arrivals, nuclear power 

 Tuesday, 27 February 2007 

 Doorstop: Parliament House, Canberra 

 E&OE… 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Ladies and gentlemen, overnight the Senate passed significant legislation in  relation to citizenship in Australia.  The effect of the legislation is that in the  future people will have to spend a period of four years of lawful presence in  Australia in order to become a citizen of this country.  That’s a change in  terms of the time but also a change in that previously there was a reference to  permanent residence rather than lawful residence.  This is important because  the Government believes that immigration is a process which should lead to  citizenship of the Commonwealth of Australia.  It’s not just an event as  signified by the citizenship ceremony, but a process in which we hope that  people coming to this country will come to know and understand and share in  the values that we commonly share in this country.  And a period of four years  is an appropriate time; it’s hard to think that having been here for four years  people wouldn’t understand generally the process and the values which are  involved.   

 I should point out that this was the first stage in the citizenship changes which  the Government is proposing.  We still have the legislation to come forward for  the citizenship tests and that will be coming forward in the Parliament some  time in the first half of this year. 

 QUESTION: 

 Minister, have you had any representations from Coalition colleagues on the  Sri Lankan asylum seekers? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Look, I have discussions with my colleagues all the time and I obviously meet  with colleagues in terms of the normal backbench process.  So, yes, we have  ongoing discussions about all of these issues. 

 QUESTION: 

 Can you rule out sending them back to Sri Lanka via Indonesia? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 The Government has made a couple of things absolutely clear.  The first is  that in accordance with the policy that we have been pursuing, that the  Australian Government will determine who comes to Australia.  Secondly, we  wish to deter sorts of activities which involve danger, in particular, to the way  in which people are brought to Australia.  Can I remind you it’s not that long  ago that we had a boat sink and we had the tragic loss of life.  We’ve had an  incident just recently in which a group of people who were on their way to  Christmas Island, according to them, in a vessel which proved to be  unseaworthy and in those circumstances you could have another tragedy.  So  we want to deter people from taking that sort of approach to Australia.  There  are proper processes under the United Nations High Commission for  Refugees’ guidelines. People can join a queue and they will be processed and  we’re one of the most generous nations in the world so far as humanitarian  programmes are concerned. 

 QUESTION: 

 But is the Indonesian option off the table? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 So thirdly, well, can I just finish the answer to the question, thirdly we will  continue to operate in accordance with our international obligations, and those  international obligations include not sending somebody back to a country  where they would face persecution.  That’s been absolutely clear from the  outset and that remains part of our approach to this issue. 

 QUESTION: 

 So do you suspect that if you do return them to Indonesia they would be  deported to Sri Lanka where they would face persecution? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Well, I’m not going to answer a hypothetical.  I can answer according to the  principle and the way in which we would approach this.  And the principle is  that we will not be returning people to a place where they face persecution  whether that return is direct or indirect. 

 QUESTION: 

 Do you believe these people will face persecution? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Well, that’s a matter to be ascertained.  If they make an asylum claim then,  then obviously the process of determining their asylum or refugee status is  determined.  And that’s done in accordance with the United Nations High  Commission for Refugees’ guidelines and that’s the way in which we’ve 

 operated.  I’m not going to prejudge it, there’s, I believe, they’ve made some  indication they want to make that claim.  They’ll be able to make those claims  but it has to go through the proper process. 

 QUESTION: 

 If it’s discovered that they would not face persecution they would be sent back  straight away? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 No, we will process them in the proper way and that will be according to all the  processes of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees puts in  place.  But can I stress this, they will not be sent back directly or via another  country if that means that they are returned to a place where they face  persecution. 

 QUESTION: 

 (Inaudible) 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Well, I’m not going to jump ahead of what the process will or won’t discover.   We are going through this in a proper, appropriate, methodical way according  to all the guidelines that are in place and once we’ve determined that we can  make some further decisions but there’s no point in me speculating or jumping  ahead as to what this might determine. 

 QUESTION: 

 (Inaudible) 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Look, we, we are looking at options and there are obviously two or three  options that are available.  One is the discussion that we’re having with  Indonesia but unless the Indonesians will agree to these people being  processed under the United Nations High Commission for Refugees’  guidelines, well, then that option simply will be ruled out by Australia.  We’re  not going to, as I said. Secondly, there’s an option obviously of Nauru and  thirdly there’s an option of Christmas Island.  Now what’s important here, can I  make this point, what’s important here is that we send the strongest possible  message of deterrence to people engaged in this activity.  I read reports in the  media this morning that they’d paid between $US5000-10 000 for this  passage from Indonesia, I don’t know what other costs might have been  involved.  This is a business for some people, to smuggle people around the  world.  And it’s a despicable business, it’s a very dangerous business and we  want to stop it and we want to send the strongest possible message that this  is not an acceptable way of going about things. 

 QUESTION: 

 Do you think processing on Christmas Island would undermine that message?  It would encourage the people smugglers? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Well, what’s important is what is the strongest possible message of  deterrence?  And obviously a message of deterrence is that you don’t get to  Australia, that you end up being processed appropriately but that processing  occurs somewhere else.  And that’s why the Australian Government has  continued to operate with the option, for example, of Nauru in place.   Obviously if they were returned to Indonesia, but that would have to be  acceptable, then that sends a pretty clear message quickly that paying all this  money and setting out on a leaky old boat for Australia is not going to result in  the outcome that was wanted but we’ll look at all the options. 

 QUESTION: 

 So is processing them in Australia, including Christmas Island, would be a  victory for the people smugglers? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Not necessarily, but obviously we’ve already taken steps in order of excising  certain places, including Christmas Island, so that they don’t get to the  mainland of Australia.  That’s part of our, part of our message but, as I said,  what I believe the people of Australia want us to do is to send the strongest  possible message of deterrence we can.  And that’s why we’re looking at all  the options. 

 QUESTION: 

 (Inaudible) … indicated to the Government as some of the officials have  indicated publicly that transfer back to Sri Lanka is something under  contemplation by the look of it? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Well, I heard a radio interview this morning with an official from Indonesia and  I noted that he did say there may be other options to that which he seemed to  be having put to him.  We will continue discussions with Indonesia but I make  it absolutely clear, beyond the basis, that our international obligations are  met.  That’s part of our twin objective, our objective is to determine who  comes to Australia, to deter this sort of activity but to do so in a way which will  meet our international obligations. 

 QUESTION: 

 (Inaudible) … guarantee from Indonesia these people wouldn’t be returned  until a time when their passage of arrival and safety to return (inaudible) … 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 What we will be seeking form Indonesia if they are agreeable to this, or they  show some indication that they might be, is an assurance that these people  will be processed in Indonesia according the UNHCR guidelines.  The United  Nations High Commission for Refugees operates in Indonesia and therefore  that could take place.  But if that’s not going to occur, well, then the  Indonesian option’s out. 

 QUESTION: 

 Who’s talking to the Indonesians?  You or … 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 I’m not directly.  This is being done, obviously, through our diplomatic  channels and through the Department of Foreign Affairs. 

 QUESTION: 

 Would you be comfortable with a nuclear power plant in your electorate? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Well, there’s probably not much room for a nuclear power plant in my  electorate.  But can I answer the question more generally and that is to say  that nuclear power should remain one of the options in discussion about the  broader issue of climate change in Australia.  It should be an option on the  table, it should be explored and that’s what the Government is hoping that will  occur.  We shouldn’t just in a knee-jerk way rule out nuclear power because  there are a lot of advantages of nuclear power, it’s obviously clean. 

 QUESTION: 

 Is the Government exploring that with Ron Walker and … 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Well, you’ll have to ask Mr Walker that and perhaps ask the Environment  Minister.  I’ve been, as you can imagine, a little preoccupied with one or two  other issues. 

 Thank you. 

 [Ends]
