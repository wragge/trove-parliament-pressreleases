  Parliamentary Friends for Western Sahara 

  Africa’s last colony still waiting for justice   Today the people of East Timor celebrated the first anniversary of the popular   consultation which resulted in their independence. However the UN has so far failed   to deliver a similar outcome for the people of the last Colony in Africa, Western   Sahara. 

  At the inaugural meeting of the Parliamentary Friends of Western Sahara, the newly   elected Chair, Senator Sue West, commented on the broad and multi partisan   support amongst parliamentarians for the rights of the Saharawis. 

  “The UN has now been in Western Sahara for ten years and spent over USD 550   million. Yet the Saharawis are still waiting for a referendum of self-determination.   How long should they have to wait? 

  “The International community must put pressure on Morocco to stop their delaying   tactics,” Senator West said. 

  The Deputy Chair, Senator Lyn Allison, spoke about her recent visit to the Saharawi   refugee camps in Algeria. 

  “I was moved by the refugee’s determination and impressed with their patience. 

  “Evlerybody knew about the role Australia and the International Community played   during the referendum process in East Timor. They wanted to know when the   International Community would take a similar ac:tion in Western Sahara,” Senator   Allison said. 

  Morocco has occupied Western Sahara since 1975. The United Nations has had   authority to organise a referendum since 1991. Morocco has consistently obstructed   the process. 

  The Parliamentary Friends of Western Sahara has been established to: 

  l f?aise awareness in Parliament about the situation in Western Sahara.   l Lobby the Australian Government to take an active role in encouraging the UN to   resolve the issue through the organisation of the long awaited referendum.   l Highlight the human rights abuses in the occupied areas of Western Sahara.

  The unfinished struggle 

  The Morrocan occupation of the Western Sahara has been based on violence. Despite nearly ren years   of international pressure to allow a free referendum on idependence, Morocco is still obstructing the   process. Human rights violations are being used as a tool t,o block the Saharawi’s path to independence. 

  Since its occupation Morocco has undertaken the systematic ‘disappearing’ of Saharawi people,   kidnapping individuals, imprisoning and torturing them. It has been calculated that almost 1,000 have   been disappeared since the Moroccan occupation. 

  In 199 1, as a result of international pressure, Morocco released 270 Saharawis who had ‘disappeared’ for   16 years. Former Saharawi detainees have told of torture and the death of many of their people. 

  None of those released have been compensated, nor have the families of those that have been killed.   Human rights organisations such as Amnesty International have regularly condemned Morocco’s   human rights record, especially its treatment of Saharawis in the occunied areas. 

  In 1995 the Deputy Chair of   MINURSO’s identification   Commission, former US ambassador,   Frank Ruddy, described Moroccan   behaviour as ‘Mafia-like” and   characterised it as ‘thuggery”. He also   stated that “Morocco does not want   the referendum because the risks   outweigh any possible gains”. 

  The presence of the UN in Western   Sahara has not deterred Morocco   from continuing to abuse human   rights. Peaceful demonstrations have   been violently suppressed. For just   listening to the Polisario radio,   Saharawis have been tortured and   jailed. 

  Saharawis in the occupied areas are under siege, very few foreigners have managed to visit the area, and   travel outside the territories is very restricted. Amnesty International have identified 500 “disappeared”   Saharawis whose whereabouts remain unknown. 

  After 13 years of war, diplomatic activity by the UN and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) 

  resulted in a settlement plan which was accepted by both parties in 1988. UN Security Council   Resolutilons - 658 (1990) and 690 (1991) outlined the settlement plan’s objective to organise a free and   fair referendum supervised by the UN. 

  The UN peace-keeping mission known as MINURSO was responsible for drawing up a list of eligible   voters and organising the poll. MINURSO was also to monitor the lead-up to and holding of the   referendum. 

  The referendum would offer voters two choices: either integration with Morocco or independence for   Western Sahara. The UN planned to commence the official cease-fire from I991 leading up to a   referendum in 1992. 

  One month prior to the official cease-fire’s commencement (an unoff&.l cease-fire had been in place   for two years), Morocco launched fierce air strikes against POLISARIO settlements. Morocco   subsequently denied freedom of movement to MINURSO, denied access to independent observers to   the occupied territory and governed the territory in complete contravention of the UN peace plan. 

  In December 1991 the UN’s Special Representative resigned in protest at the UN’s failure to confront   Morocco. In May 1994 J ean-Luc Held, former head of MlNURSO’s medical unit said ‘the UN is   _ . ..unab~ m react.. . the UN z’s fiighenea( those who work there arefighmd.. . ” 

  Morocco has delayed the referendum for years with arguments over voter eligibility. Approximately   200,000 Moroccan settlers have moved to the territory ofWestern Sahara with the aim of skewing the   vote. A date for the referendum had been set for July 31 2000 but it now appears as if Morocco will   continue its delaying tactics and not honour its agreement. 

  There appears to continue to be a breakdown in negotiations and diminishing hopes for a free and fair   referendum. POLISARIO has intimated that if no referendum is heId by the end of 2000 it may   recommence hostilities. 

  The parallels with E ast Timor are striking. The key roie of the international community in working   toward a free and fair referendum cannot be overstated. POLISARIO made a commitment not to   hijack planes, kidnap people or target civilians in order to seek world attention. 

  Thy have consequently been largely ignored by the international media and the communities whose   opinions influence international efforts such as those of East Timor or in assisting organisations like the   PLO. 

  The Western Sahara people require Australia’s assistance raising the international attention needed to   pressure Morocco to hold the vote that they have sacrificed everything to obtain.
