 In Defending a Moderate Concept of Cultural Equality1   

 Dr. Baogang He   

 

 Saul Bellow is famously quoted as saying something  like,  ‘When  the  Zulus  produce  a  Tolstoy  we  will   read him’. This is taken as a quintessential statement 

 of  European  arrogance,  not  just  because  Bellow  is   allegedly  being  de  facto  insensitive  to  the  value  of   Zulu culture, but frequently also because it is seen to  reflect  a  denial  in  principle  of  human  equality   (Charles Taylor, 1994, p.42).   

 

 There  is  a  progressive  current  to  the  idea  of  equality  which  has   traversed  the  spectrum  from  the  political  equality  of  rights  and   suffrage  in  democratic  systems,  through  economic  equality   (embraced  through  socialist  principles)  and  social  equality  which   stresses  equal  access  to  jobs  and  social  services,  to  the  notion  of   cultural  equality.  The  notion  of  cultural  equality  has  assumed   increasing importance in the normative discourse of multiculturalism  and  international  relations.  Since  the  end  of  World  War  II,  the  

 international community has repudiated decisively the older tradition  of  a  racial  or  ethnic  hierarchy,  and  come  to  endorse  the  idea  of   human  and  ethnic  equality.  Indeed,  with  the  rise  of  East  Asian   economic  power  in  the  1980s,  policy-makers  and  academia  placed   particular emphasis on the notion of cultural equality. Nevertheless,  the events of September  11 in 2001 seem to have stalled this trend,  undermining  the  value  of  cultural  equality  and  perhaps  rendering  it   impossible  because  of  a  supposed  civilizational  conflict  between   Western and Islamic cultures. 

 A  number  of  theorists  have  focused  on  the  idea  of  cultural   equality. Notable in this respect are Edward Said’s idea of equality of  civilizations,  Will  Kymlicka’s  concern  with  the  cultural  equality  of   minorities, Charles Taylor’s emphasis on the equal value of cultures,  and  Iris  Marion  Young’s  demand  for  the  equal  value  of  different   cultures to be publicly affirmed. Recently, however, Brian Barry has

 mounted a substantial critique of this body of work with its support  for multiculturalism and the equal value of cultures. As reflected in  the  title  of  his  book,  Culture  and  Equality,  Barry  seeks  to  separate  

 culture  from  equality,  and  indeed  repudiates  the  notion  of  ‘cultural   equality’ (2001, p.266).   Differing  from  Barry’s  approach,  this  paper  aims  to  defend  the   concept of cultural equality by critically engaging with the idea and  dealing constructively with attendant problems and limitations. It has  two basic aims. The first aim is to mount an argument in favour of a  more limited form of cultural equality. The second one is to provide  a  critical  response  to  those  who  reject  the  possibility  of  any   presumption  of  cultural  equality.  The  paper  begins  by  assessing   arguments in support of cultural equality and discussing its multiple  meanings and value. It then canvasses some of the arguments against  cultural  equality,  highlights  the  complex  theoretical  difficulties  and   problems  that  arise  if  the  question  of  cultural  equality  is  taken   seriously, and suggests strategies for dealing with these problems.  

 For the purposes of this paper, cultures are understood as a set of  attitudes, values, sentiments, and beliefs that give order and meaning  to  social  process  and  that  provide  the  underlying  assumptions  and   rules  that  govern  human  behaviour.  Cultures  are  seen  as  certain   social  practices  including  religious  activities,  the  reproduction  of   language  and  traditional  custom,  and  philosophical  interpretation.  Cultures  are  also  understood  as  open,  multifaceted,  and  dynamic   systems  that  possess  essentially  multiple  groups  with  overlapping   memberships that are interactive and internally negotiated. They are  sites  of  contestation  and  heterogeneity,  of  hybridization  and  cross-fertilization,  whose  boundaries  are  inevitably  indeterminate  (Tully,   1995, p.30). Clearly, as Robert B. Walker (1990) points out, there is  a  great  deal  of  confusion  over  the  concept  of  ‘culture’  itself  in   international relations. 

 We should consider the context in which the principle of cultural  equality  can  be  defended  and  what  sort  of  cultural  inequality  is   acceptable.  Two  contexts  need  to  be  distinguished.  In  an   international  context,  cultural  equality  is  concerned  with  equal   treatment  with  other  cultures  in  making  foreign  policies.  This  is  an   external cultural equality. In a multicultural state, cultural equality is  about the equality of cultural communities within a nation-state. This

 is  an  internal  cultural  equality.  It  is  important  to  have  a  clear   sociological  understanding  of  the  context  and  content  of  cultural   equality.  Any  defense  or  rejection  of  the  idea  of  cultural  equality   must be made in the concrete context in which the specific content of  cultural equality has particular meanings. This is the major problem  with  Barry’s  argument  against  cultural  equality:  it  fails  to   contextualize  the  concrete  content  of  cultural  equality.  Instead,  his   approach  is  to  examine  critically  the  ideas  of  cultural  equality  put   forward  by  Taylor  and  Young  (Barry,  2001,  pp.264-71).   Consequently,  he  overlooks  the  context  and  content  of  cultural   equality itself. 

 

 

 Arguments for Cultural Equality   

 Linking Culture and Citizenship: Typically, nation-states employ the  institutions  of  citizenship  to  create  cultural  homogenization  within   civil society and thus deny the cultural rights of minority groups. In  this  way  they  tend  to  promote  national  cultures  at  the  cost  of   minority  cultures. Traditionally,  citizenship  and  culture  have  been   regarded  as  mutually  exclusive,  especially  by  classical  liberals;  yet,  

 we  can  detect  more  than  a  hint  of  hypocrisy.   For  instance,  in   colonial India, classical liberalism took indigenous culture seriously  so  much  so  that  it  formed  the  view  that  inhabitants  of  this  culture   were rendered incapable of autonomous action and thereby unsuited  to citizenship (Hindess, 2001). Meanwhile, back at home, culture and  citizenship  were  seen  as  separate.  In  the  case  of  the  French   Revolution,  which  was  premised  on  the  view  that  all  humans  are   equal, it declared equality for all irrespective  of  race,  ethnicity,  and  culture. We see that there is no space here for ‘cultural equality’ and  culture  appears  to  be  largely  irrelevant  to  the  liberal  conception  of   equality,  in  which  a  secular  civic  state  should  be  ethnically  and   culturally  neutral.  In  other  words,  the  French  civic  tradition  favors   the  universal  over  the  particular,  civic  over  ethnic  and  cultural   values.2  

 In  practice,  however,  there  is  inequality  in  the  nation-state   system  where  minority  cultural  groups  are  treated  differently  and   majority  culture  tends  to  assume  a  privileged  position  as  the

 paradigm  of  national  identity  and  nationhood.  Nic  Craith  Mairead   (2002)  argues,  for  instance,  that  in  Britain  English  has  been   institutionalized  as  the  national  language,  a  symbol  of  national   coherence,  while  Welsh  and  Irish  have  long  been  regarded  as  a   ‘commodity,’  so  that  government  subsidy  for  their  rejuvenation  is   seen as some  sort of paternalistic  favor.  In  other  words, a supposed  ‘neutral’  state  has  favored,  financed,  and  privileged  a  majority   language  (English),  thereby  putting  minority  cultures  in  a  weak   position.  The  problem  now  is  how  to  level  the  playing  field   according to the principle of cultural equality and to link citizenship  with  culture.  Mairead  suggests  that  the  idea  of  citizenship  should   seriously embrace that of cultural equality regarding it as integral to  citizenship.   

 Deepening  the  Idea  of  Equality:  The  idea  of  citizenship  has  been   associated  with  the  struggle  for  political,  economic,  and  social   equality.  According  to  T.  H.  Marshall  (1963),  the  idea  of  ‘full   citizenship’ for all is linked to the welfare state’s attack on poverty.  However,  citizenship  is  no  longer  exclusively  concerned  with  the   struggle for political, economic, and social equality, but has become  a  major  site  of  conflict  over  cultural  identity  and  demands  for  the   recognition of cultural rights and equal cultural status.  

 Cultural right is the claim made by a cultural group for cultural  empowerment,  namely  the  equal  capacity  to  participate  effectively,   creatively,  and  successfully  in  one’s  society.  Cultural  claims  to   language  and  religion  are  typically  extra-state  or  supra-national   rights.  

 The idea of cultural equality extends the claims of cultural right,  demanding  equal  status  for  different  cultures. Adherents  to  the  idea   of cultural  equality  may  well  think  certain  form  of multiculturalism  insufficient  because  it  recognizes  cultural  diversity  but  not  cultural   equality.  While  multiculturalism  aims  to  ‘resolve’  minority  culture   problems  by  granting  minority  rights,  it  does  not  attempt  to  do   anything  with  the  taken  for  granted  privileged  position  of  the   majority  culture.  Thus  to  be  fully  effective  as  a  tool  of  cultural   equality,  multiculturalism  needs  to  be  based  upon  the  principle  of   equal respect.

 Culture  as  a  Primary  Good:  According  to  John  Rawls  there  are   things  that  we  need  regardless  of  our  natural  talents  and  our  aims.   These  he  calls  ‘primary  goods’  and  his  list  includes  liberty,   opportunity,  income,  wealth,  and  the  bases  of  self  respect.   Fundamental to his theory of justice is the premise that parties to the  original position will rationally seek to maximize their share of these  primary goods, which are to be distributed equally unless an unequal  distribution benefits the least favored (Rawls, 1971).  

 The  issue  here  is  what  Rawls  means  by  the  ‘bases  of  self   respect.’  More  particularly,  can  Rawls’s  idea  of  self  respect  be   extended  to  include  the  equal  recognition  of  cultures?  For  Tully   (1995,  p.189)  the  answer  is  affirmative:  that  in  making  self  respect   one  of  the  primary  goods,  Rawls  is  committed  to  the  public   recognition and affirmation of all cultures. By contrast, Barry (2001,  p.268)  argues  that  Rawls  does  not  describe  self  respect  as  one  of   those  ‘primary  goods’  whose  distribution  is  the  concern  of  social   justice.  Rawls  only  mentions  ‘the  social  bases  of  self  respect’  that   refer  to  equal  civil  and  political  rights.  It  is  questionable  whether   Rawls has anything meaningful to say on this issue. Instead it may be  more constructive to look at the work of other social justice theorists,  such as Michael Walzer, Will Kymlicka, and Bhiku Parekh, who all  emphasize culture as a primary good in institutional design. 

 For  instance,  while  Walzer’s  list  of  social  or  basic  goods   includes  offices,  wealth,  honor,  education,  health,  membership,  and   safety,  he  also  sees  cultural  membership  as  a  fundamental  value   because it defines the shared understanding of social goods within a  given culture (Walzer, 1983). The problem, as Kymlicka points out,  is  in  identifying  which  community  is  in  fact  the  bearer  of  cultural   membership.  Here  Walzer  faces  a  challenging  boundary  problem:   how can two different historical communities within one nation-state  work out the shared meanings of all citizens?  

 Kymlicka  (1989,  p.162)  also  argues  for  the  primary  good  of   cultural  membership:  ‘The  individuals  who  are  an  unquestionable   part of the liberal moral ontology are viewed as individual members  of a particular cultural community, for whom cultural membership is  an  important  good.’  In  his  view  the  intrinsic  value  of  cultural   diversity  lies  in  the  context  of  choice  that  the  cultural  structure   provides; individual choice is dependent on the presence of a societal

 culture,  defined  by  language  and  history  (Kymlicka,  1995,  p.8).   Jeremy  Waldron  (1995,  p.106)  disagrees  with  Kymlicka’s   assessment:  ‘from  the  fact  that  each  genuine  option  must  have  a   cultural  meaning,  it  does  not  follow  that  there  must  be  one  cultural   framework in which each available option is assigned a meaning.’ 

 On the other hand, Bhiku Parekh 1994, p.13; also 1998, p.206)  leans  towards  Kymlicka’s  position  with  regard  to  equal  respect  for   different  cultures:  ‘The  liberal  is  in  theory  committed  to  equal   respect  for  persons.  Since  human  beings  are  culturally  embedded,   respect for them entails respect for their cultures and ways of life.’    

 Global  Citizenship  and  Cultural  Equality:  The  theory  of  global   citizenship is premised on the notion that all peoples - insiders and  outsiders  -  are  equal,  as  are  all  funding  agencies  and  recipients.  In   practice,  however,  there  are  always  structural  inequalities  that   prevent  the  equal  distribution  of  goods  and  resources.  As  Alexius   Jemadu (2004) argues that transnational networks remain challenged  to overcome the structural inequalities in the relationship between the  Indonesian  NGOs  and  their  international  partners.  Transnational   activists  may  use  resources  and  funding  in  undemocratic  ways  and   this should be seen as an internal contradiction of global citizenship. 

 Such  structural  inequalities  pose  a  challenge  to  transnational   activists  who  are  committed  to  the  notion  of  global  citizenship  and   who value democracy. How does one deal with structural inequality?  One way is to push the idea of world citizenship in the direction of  democratic  citizenship.  That  is,  if  one  understands  democracy  as   primarily  concerned  with  equality  then  global  citizenship  must   address  the  issue  of  cultural  equality.  Global  cultural  citizenship   transcends  national  borders  and  is  concerned  with  cultural  equality   between  different  civilizations  and  cultures.  To  be  effective,  the   agenda  directed  to  the  democratization  of  global  culture  must  take   cultural equality seriously. 

 Global  citizenship  is  premised  on  the  notion  of  a  floating  or   transcendent cultural identity that is not situated in or related to any  specific  form  of  national  identity.  Yet  it  does  not  deny  the   importance  or  value  of  national  and  local  cultures  nor  does  it   undermine  the  desire  of  individuals  to  belong  to  a  specific  place.    Indeed, those who support the right to self-determination also tend to

 see the need, in certain circumstances, for global and local cultures to  align  themselves  against  certain  forms  of  national  culture.  Global   citizens  and  transnational  activists  will  always  encounter  different   cultures  and  be  faced  with  the  question  of  whether  to  treat  the   cultures of strangers and refugees as equal or inferior.  

 Moreover,  as  the  processes  of  cultural  and  economic   globalization march on, commercial culture has come increasingly to  prevail over and so undermine traditional cultures, albeit without the  use  of  force,  giving  rise  to  what  Benjamin  Barber  refers  to  as   "McWorld"  phenomenon.  This  tendency  for  global  commercial   culture to threaten the survival of small cultures adds further impetus  to the project of realizing cultural equality. 

 

 The Value of Cultural Equality: Most important, the idea of cultural  equality  provides  a  normative  basis  from  which  transnational   activism  can  deal  with  the  structural  inequalities  outlined  above.  It   does this by challenging a form of political power in which cultural  superiority plays a part in the domination of the weak by the strong.   In  particular,  it  challenges  the  master  concept  of  liberty  in   international  trade  and  within  the  cultural  sphere.  According  to  the   idea  of  cultural  equality,  liberals  should  listen  and  think  about  non-liberal questions arising from non-liberal societies and even make a  concession  to  non-liberal  practices  that  can  be  shown  to  have  some  

 normative validity.  Parekh  (2000,  p.14)  argues  that  liberalism  ‘represents  a   particular  cultural  perspective  and  cannot  provide  a  broad  and   impartial enough framework to conceptualize other cultures or their  relations with it.’ Indeed we can say that liberalism is neither salient  nor predominant in the Middle East and in East Asia. This raises the  question  of  whether  liberals  can  in  fact  ultimately  impose  their   liberal  mode  of  thinking  on  others  or  whether  they  must  recognize   the  legitimacy  of  alternative  modes  of  normative  thought.  For   example,  drug  policies  reflect  different  historical  and  cultural   traditions.  Thus,  while  Holland  adopts  a  more  liberal  and  lenient   approach  towards  drug  issues,  Malaysia,  Thailand,  Singapore,  and   China  take  a  much  tougher  line.  It  is  difficult  to  say  that  the  Dutch   liberal  approach  is  superior  to  the  non-liberal  policies  of  Malaysia,   Singapore, and China.

 The  right  to  bear  arms  and  the  right  for  gay  couples  to  adopt   children  suggest  a  life  style  that  depends  on  the  particularity  of   cultural conditions and history; but the pressure for such rights would  hold  little  weight  in  poor  societies  that  are  more  concerned  with   survival and to put bread on the table. In these societies the pursuit of  such liberties would be regarded as a luxury that has little to do with  the  daily  necessities  of  food,  medicine,  and  clean  water.  While  the   right to bear arms and the right for gay couples might be seen to have  primacy  in  certain  Western  cultures,  this  is  simply  insufficient  and   irrelevant to meet the needs of the poor in the third world. 

 Given its claims to openness, tolerance, and plurality, liberalism  promises  genuine  dialogues  between  different  cultures;  but,  by   viewing  equality  as  secondary  to  liberty,  liberalism  can  come  to   regard as inferior other cultures that seek equality first. So while the  voice  from  the  ‘South’  may  be  heard  it  is  not  generally  taken   seriously  in  the  area  of  transnational  activities  such  as  international   conferences  and  publications.  Occasionally,  organizers  of  global  or   international conferences will include people from the third world or  the  South  as  token  ‘representatives’  but  seldom  are  they  taken   seriously as equal participants. An example illustrates the point. Paul  M. Evans, from the Institute of Asian Research, University of British  Colombia,  Canada,  has  produced  a  study  of  the  various  kinds  of   ‘engagement’  that  occur  in  international  politics.  It  provides  39   definitions that include the categories of comprehensive, constrained,  cooperative,  deep,  deeper,  realistic,  selective,  and  conditional   engagement.  However,  there  is  no  mention  of  equal  engagement.4  The  justification  for  this  neglect  is  that  an  authoritarian regime  like   China does not respect equality and is thus not entitled to be treated  equally. ‘It is equally unjust to treat unequals equally as it is to treat  equals unequally’ (Crick, 1992, p.13).   

 Critical Definitions of Cultural Equality   

 It  is  important  to  distinguish  two  conceptions  of  equality.  One  is  a   universal conception of equality, which stresses the equal treatment,  right, opportunity, and entitlement of all human beings. The other is  a differential approach, which emphasizes diversities and differences.  Most  writings  on  cultural  or  minority  rights  adopt  this  latter  

 

 

 10 

 differential approach, seeing it as unjust for a disadvantaged group to  be  forced  to  compete  with  a  dominant  group  on  unequal  terms.  As   Kymlicka  (1989,  p.162)  puts  it,  ‘the  members  of  minority  cultural   communities  may  face  particular  kinds  of  disadvantages  whose  

 rectification requires and justifies the provision of minority rights.’ A  clear exception to this position is that of Brian Barry, who rejects the  differential notion of equality in favor of an egalitarian approach to  group rights.  

 This  paper  deviates  from  the  differential  notion  of  equality   espoused  by  thinkers  such  as  Kymlicka  and  adopts  instead  a  global   perspective  of  cultural  equality.  This  is  because  the  politics  of   international  relations  tends  to  associate  the  notion  of  cultural   equality  primarily  with  the  equal  respect  and  treatment  of  other   cultures. So by taking a differential notion of cultural equality at the  global  level  we  may  neglect  the  important  question  of  an  equal   respect for cultures across nation-states.   

  Equality has many meanings:   

 â¢ All  people  are  equal,  because  they  share  humanity  in   common;  â¢ All  people  should  be  equal,  and  should  be  treated  as  equal   beings;  â¢ All people are entitled to equal opportunity (Williams, 1971);  â¢ All people should be equally subject to the law;  â¢ Law should be impartially administered;  â¢ All  the  advantages  of  society  should  be  thrown  into  one  

 common stock (Stephen, 1993), p.124).   

 Similarly, we can trace multiple meanings of cultural equality. It  should  be  stressed,  however,  that  cultural  equality  does  not  refer  to   the equal value of cultural artifacts such as oil paintings and novels.  As  Taylor  (1994,  pp.66-7)  states  clearly,  ‘There  is  no  reason  to   believe  that,  for  instance,  the  different  art  forms  of  a  given  culture   should  all  be  of  equal,  or  even  of  considerable,  value;  and  every   culture can go through phases of decadence.’ If we unpack the idea  of cultural equality we can isolate various conceptual components.

 1.  Equality  as  an  Epistemological  Starting  Point:  Who  defines   culture?  What  constitutes  culture?  Where  are  the  boundaries  of   cultures?  Who  has  the  right  to  interpret  culture?  Who  can  be   construed  as  a  cultural  actor?  While  one  cannot  definitively  settle   these  questions,  a  normative  commitment  to  the  equality  principle   seems  to  provide  the  most  constructive  starting  point.  Drawing  on   Rawls’s  theoretical  strategy  one  suggests  that  parties  in  the  original   position  under  the  veil  of  ignorance  are  likely  to  choose  equality   principle  to  protect  their  lives  and  advance  their  cultures.  And,   according to Taylor (1994. p.66), equal respect for all cultures should  be ‘a starting hypothesis with which we ought to approach the study  of any other culture.’ 

 However,  this  epistemological  starting  point  confronts  a   methodological difficulty brought about by the different positions of  individualism  and  communitarianism.  An  individualist  tends  to  see   culture as an open and dynamic way of life predicated upon the ideas  and  actions  of  individuals.  In  contrast,  a  communitarian  views   culture  as  closed  and  exclusive;  and  stresses  cultural  rights  and   citizenship  and  focuses  on  the  means  by  which  individuals  access   their  own  culture  and  common  space.  Communitarians  assert  that   culture,  including  language,  cannot  be  reduced  to  individuals.  The   problem here is determining who counts as the representative of so-called  collective  culture.  While  individualists  assert  that  the   wellspring  of  culture  is  the  individual,  communitarians  hold  that   cultural  community  shapes  the  identity  of  individuals  within  it,   providing their sense of self. Moreover, they argue it is through the  common perspectives and attitudes of cultural community that social  norms  and  standards  are  established  and  internalized,  thereby   accounting for homogeneous behaviour within specific communities.   

 2.  Equal  Esteem:  The  idea  of  cultural  equality  rejects  traditional   categories  of  high  versus  low  cultures  thereby  challenging  cultural   and racial superiority. If one accepts the view that the Anglo-Saxon  race  is  destined  to  ‘spread  itself  over  the  earth’  or  that  it  is  the   mission of ‘the American people as [God’s] chosen nation to finally  lead  in  the  regeneration  of  the  world,’  there  seems  little  room  for   cultural  equality  and  plenty  of  scope  for  racial  inequality  (Chace,  

 

 

 12 

 2002,  p.34).  While  Amy  Gutmann  (1994,  p.5)  raises  a  difficult   question  of  whether  a  liberal  democratic  society  should  respect   cultures that hold themselves ethnically or racially superior to others,  there  are  in  reality  few  if  any  non-democratic  cultures  that  hold   superior  positions  in  the  face  of  Western  domination.  Rather,  the   urgent question is to deal with the taken for granted superiority of the  West and Western democratic traditions.   

 3.  Equal  Right  to  the  Interpretation  of  Culture:  A  serious  problem   associated  with  global  cultural  production  is  that  weak  cultures  are   forced to gain their recognition from more powerful cultures. Indeed  the final arbiters of culture, at least with respect to the global social  sciences,  seem  to  be  located  in  the  hallowed  halls  of  Harvard,   Cambridge,  Oxford,  Princeton,  and  other  renowned  Western   universities.  Yet  the  idea  of  cultural  equality  seems  to  suggest  that   academic  arbiters  should  be  more  representative  and  located  more   equitably within different cultural communities. In this respect, it is  suggested that along with traditional Western interpretations, such as  rational  choice  theory  and  institutionalism,  non-Western  theoretical   frameworks, such as Confucianism and Islam, should be deployed to  help  fully  explain  the  cultural  phenomena  of  East  and  West.  The   current practice which privileges Western approaches serves to deny  the principle of cultural equality. 

 Nevertheless,  caution  should  be  exercised  in  designating  the   equal  right  to  cultural  interpretation.  One  could  hold  the  thesis  that   each culture has an equal right to interpret what constitutes equality  while  others  can  entertain  the  antithesis  that  an  equal  right  to   interpret what is equality will lead to a justification of inequality. For  an  example,  it  is  often  assumed  that  Islam  has  provided  a  cultural   basis  for  terrorism.  While  this  assumption  may  be  true,  one  may   argue  that  to  posit  a  necessary  relationship  between  Islam  and   terrorism is to be biased. We need to recognize that terrorism occurs  not  only  in  and  through  Muslim  culture  but  also  Western  and   Confucian  cultures.3  Nevertheless,  any  such  recognition  cannot  be   used  to  legitimize  terrorism.  It  cannot  be  argued,  for  instance,  that   because  ‘your  culture  has  terrorism,  the  practice  of  terrorism  in  my   culture  can  be  tolerated!’  Clearly  all  forms  of  terrorism  must  be   condemned, no matter what the justification.

 4.  Equal  Weight  in  Institutional  Design:  Equal  respect  for  cultures   should  be  taken  into  account  in  institutional  design,  although  its   incorporation may take different forms where circumstances dictate.   For  example,  the  Singapore  government  has  been  able  to   institutionalize  the  traditional  festivals  of  Chinese,  Malay,  and   Indians  as  national  public  holidays.  In  China,  Vietnam,  and  Laos,   however,  where  there  are  more  than  56  ethnic  groups,  it  is  not   possible  for  their  governments  to  recognize  all  the  traditional   festivals  of  ethnic  minorities  through  national  public  holidays.  In   these  cases,  therefore  a  differential  public  holiday  system  has  to  be   designed.    

 5.  Equal  Access  to  Cultural  Communication,  Production,  and   Distribution: The  distribution  of  or  access  to  certain  cultural  goods   should be arranged more equitably. For example, in an international  gathering,  people  from  different  cultural  backgrounds  should  have   equal  access  to  a  range  of  different  foods  that  derive  from  their   traditions.  There  should  also  be  an  equal  right  to  use  one’s  own   language  in  multicultural  communication.  While  international   organizations such as the UN and the EU use multi-languages in their  official  communications,  this  is  not  a  universally  accepted  practice.   For  instance,  in  France,  speaking  languages  other  than  French  is   sometimes  seen  as  culturally  divisive,  politically  threatening,  or   detrimental  to  French  nationalism.  Such  attitudes  surely  contradict   the idea of cultural equality.    

 6. Equal Status of Cultural Practices: Some people in Europe protest  against  the  consumption  of  dog  meat  in  Korea,  Taiwan,  and  Hong   Kong; but why should Europeans not respect the East Asian cultural  custom  of  eating  dog  meat,  particularly  during  winter?  Similarly,   should it be legitimate for Europe to impose its own views of capital  punishment on some states in the United States and Asia? It could be  argued  that  different  cultures,  which  practice  different  customs,   should  be  entitled  to  enjoy  equal  status  and  be  equally  

 accommodated  in  institutional  arrangements  and  social  policy.   Respecting  cultural  difference  is  one  way  of  implementing  the   principle of cultural equality.  

 

 

 14 

 Moreover,  cultural  order  and  mutual  dialogue  must  be   established on the basis of equality. For example, any discussion of  the  relationship  between  Confucianism  and  liberalism  should  be   based  on  the  assumption  that  the  two  traditions  exist  on  an  equal   footing because all civilizations have the right to respect and cultural  equality.  Such  an  assumption  is  obviously  implied  in  the  universal   discourse of human rights, where all human beings regardless of their  cultural  background  deserve  the  right  to  equal  respect  and   consideration. Thus a necessary step towards cultural equality in this  case  would  be  to  separate  Confucianism  from  its  association  with   authoritarianism - which has given it an inferior status to liberalism -  and  to  see  it  purely  as  a  theoretical  framework  that  offers  an   alternative way of thinking to liberalism.  

 The above six components of cultural equality can be grouped in  two categories. The first category of Points 1-3 deals with principle,  philosophical  interpretation  and  psychological  attributes  which  are   soft, subjective and abstract. The second category of Points 4-6 deals  with  the  institutional  implications  and  arrangements  of  cultural   equality  which  are  hard,  objective  and  concrete.  Among  these  six   components  of  cultural  equality,  some  are  justifiable  and  workable;   some are problematic and face enormous difficulties. A feasible and  workable  notion  of  cultural  equality  cannot  endorse  all  six   components.  Only  a  limited  and  moderate  form  of  cultural  equality   will be defended in this paper.    By  pursuing  the  idea  of  cultural  equality,  different  

 understandings of what it might entail will inevitably emerge, which  will  in  turn  offer  very  different  institutional  requirements  that  can   accommodate cultural equality. An institutionalized cultural equality  confronts  the  structure/agency  problem.  How  far  can  the  idea  of   cultural equality be institutionalized and enforced? Who is an agent  with the capacity to enforce cultural rights and equality? How can an  unequal international structure promote and realize cultural equality  across  civilizations?  If  the  state  promotes  and  protects  the  minority   rights of one culture, this cultural community has in return a duty and  obligation  to  respect  other  cultures  and  the  principle  of  equality   itself.  But  a  central  problem  associated  with  realizing  cultural   equality is the difficulty of defining exactly what constitutes ‘cultural  obligation’ without which rights are often passive and empty.

 In  addition,  there  is  the  problem  of  convergence.  This  is  the   problem  of  whether  or  not  individuals  under  the  to-be-designed   institutions  for  cultural  equality  will  ultimately  support  them.   Obviously,  under  institutional  arrangements  designed  to  realize   cultural equality, some would fare better than others. How can these  individuals  accommodate  each  other  so  that  convergence  on  the   project of cultural equality is possible?   

 Arguments against Cultural Equality   

 In  this  section,  I  would  like  to  present  a  critical  response  to  those   who reject the possibility of any presumption of cultural equality.   

 The  Incompatibility  Argument:  One  common  strategy  in  rejecting   equality  is  to  stress  the  incoherence  and  inconsistency  of  such  a   demand.  J.  R.  Lucas  (1971,  pp.138-9)  argued  in  1965  that  ‘…this   demand  [for  equality]  is  incoherent,  because  what  is  demanded  is   both  internally  inconsistent  and  incompatible  with  other  more   precious  ideals.’  Similarly,  Barry  (2001,  p.265)  points  out  the   inconsistencies  in  Taylor’s  approach  to  equal  concern  for  cultures,   suggesting  ‘he  still  tries  to  whistle  a  tune  about  the  equal  value  of   cultures while at the same time continuing to sing the old song about  incommensurability.’  The  idea  of  incommensurability  implies  that   there is no impartial or universal standpoint from which the claims of  all particular cultures can be rationally assessed, while the idea of the  equal  value  of  cultures,  according  to  Peter  Jones  (1998,  p.44),   ‘requires  us  to  bring  a  common  standard  of  values  to  all  cultures.’5  As  a  result,  Barry  (2001,  pp.264-5)  argues  strongly  that  the  idea  of   cultural equality is logically incompatible with the idea that cultures  are incommensurable.    Nagel (1991, p.3) also pointed out, ‘The unsolved problem is the  familiar one of reconciling the standpoint of the collectivity with the  standpoint of the individual.’ The impersonal standpoint produces a  powerful  demand  for  universal  impartiality  and  equality.  The   personal  standpoint  gives  rise  to  individualistic  values,  motives  and   demands which impede the pursuit and realization of equality ideals  of equality. As Gould argues (1988, p. 160) “The full development of  some  individuals  would seem  to  require  an  inequality  of  conditions  

 

 

 16 

 on  the  supposition  that  different  individuals  have  greater  capacities   or different capacities for self-development than others and therefore  have a right to more of the conditions than do others.’  

  Barry’s  argument  is  not  convincing  in  the  eyes  of  those  who   hold  the  idea  of  cultural  equality  but  do  not  endorse  the  idea  of   incommensurability.  If  we  assumes  cultural  interaction  and  holds  a   universal cross-cultural perspective, it is imperative to see equality as 

 the  basis  for  the  communication,  production,  and  distribution  of   culture both internally and externally. The idea of cultural equality is  able  to  avoid  the  position  of  cultural  relativism,  which  is  forced  to   endorse a type of equality that holds all cultural practices equal and  is unable to distinguish between their relative values. What is being  canvassed  here  is  not  relativism  but  a  willingness  to  allow  the   possibility  for  all  cultures  to  be  given  an  equal  hearing,  not  that  all   cultural  practices  are  equally  valuable.  This  avoids  the  dilemma   faced  by  cultural  relativists  who  are  forced  into  a  solipsistic  stance   that precludes open dialogue between cultures and renders consensus  impossible.    

 The  Nature  of  Culture:  Inequality  is  Natural:  Another  argument   against  cultural  equality  is  that  inequality  is  a  natural  phenomenon.   Most  cultures  are  patriarchal  and  even  pluralist  societies  contain   elitist  and  unequal  elements  (Okin,  1999,  p.17).  Moreover,  as   Thomas  Nagel  (1991,  p.131)  asserts,  ‘a  complex  culture  magnifies   their  inequality  and  diversity  by  permitting  a  wide  range  of   achievement and the flourishing of different talents.’ In other words,  culture  has  been  used  as  an  instrument  for  gaining  and  maintaining   power.    

 Power cannot be equally divided and distributed over the whole  population. It is necessarily concentrated in few hands...Besides  an inequality of power, there is an inequality of prestige, which  will  arise  in  any  society...It  will  stem  from  men’s  natural   inequality of ability resulting in their being able, some to a great  greater,  others  to  a  lesser,  extent  to  be  successful  in  achieving   their ideals’ (Lucas, 1971, p.147)    

 

 

 17

  The  above  argument  surely  questions  the  feasibility  of  cultural   equality. It holds that the idea of cultural equality contains the hoary  old chestnut of utopianism. Thus Barry (2001, pp.229-71) argues that  the  demand  for  equal  recognition  of  all  cultures  is  not  only   psychologically unattainable but also logically impossible. One who  holds  the  ideal  of  cultural  equality  is  doomed  to,  borrowing  Lucas’   (1971,  p.150)  phrase,  ‘a  life  not  only  of  grumbling  and  everlasting   envy,  but  of  endless  and  inevitable  disappointment.’  The  idea  of   cultural  equality  represents  only  stupidity,  confusion,  and  illogical   reasoning.  Cultural  equality  is  nothing  more  than,  borrowing   Stephen’s (1993, p.124) phases, ‘a vague expression of envy on the  part  of  those  who  have  not  against  those  who  have,’  or  ‘a  vague   aspiration towards a state of society in which there should be fewer  contrasts  than  there  are  at  present  between  one  man’s  lot  and   another’s.’ 

 However, this argument is not fully corrosive of the principle of  cultural equality and will not deter those who cherish a hope for its  realization.  In  their  view  the  cultural  practice  of  inequality  can  and   must be changed, and human psychology reshaped to enable cultural  equality  to  occur.  In  the  twentieth  century,  a  new  culture  of  human   rights has emerged and will continue to develop. A hundred year ago  black culture was deemed inferior by many White people. In the last  several  decades,  however,  the  transformation  of  white  perceptions   and values has made it possible to talk about racial equality between  the  White  and  Black.  Indeed,  the  transformation  of  human   psychology  is  a  necessary  condition  to  realize  the  goal  of  cultural   equality.  For  proponents  of  cultural  equality  the  battle  is  one  over   human feelings. The key issue for them is to criticize any tendencies  towards  cultural  bias,  arrogance,  prejudice,  and  superiority.  In   Taylor’s  (1994,  pp.66-7)  words,  ‘withholding  the  presumption  [of   equal  respect  for  cultures]  might  be  seen  as  the  fruit  merely  of   prejudice  or  of  ill  will.  It  might  even  be  tantamount  to  a  denial  of   equal status.’  

 

 Fear  of  Cultural  Equality:  There  are  those  who  fear  that  the   equalization of different cultures will result in the loss of elite culture  and  a  subsequent  vulgarization.  Nevertheless,  an  assertion  of  equal   respect  for  cultures  can be  combined  with  an  unequal  evaluation  of  

 

 

 18 

 cultural products through making, as Mill did, a distinction between  higher and lower pleasures, or between high and low evaluations of  cultural product.   

 Inherent Paradox (I): Stephen (1993, p.163) said the recognition of  substantial  equality  is  ‘usually  a  step  towards  the  development  of   inherent  inequalities.’  If  cultural  equality  is  taken  to  be  an  integral   part  of  world  citizenship,  one  confronts  a  series  of  paradoxes.  For   example,  demands  for  equality  between  different  cultures  and   civilizations constitute external forms of cultural equality. However,  the external equality of cultures does not necessarily ensure internal  cultural equality. Rather it entails the possibility of justifying unequal  arrangements  within  a  culture  or  civilization.  Indeed,  in  the  politics   of  cultural  equality,  the  idea  of  ‘cultural  equality’  can  be  used  to   promote  the  status  of  ‘Asian  values’  against  human  rights.  It  also   entertains  the  idea  that  Islamic  culture  should  enjoy  equal  status  in   the  struggle  against  new  forms  of  neo-liberal  ‘imperialism.’   Demanding  equality  between  Western  and  Islamic  civilizations  can   downplay  the  human  rights  principle  for  it  is  seen  as  a  product  of   Western culture.  

 It  is  true  that  one  sort  of  equality  always  implies  and  involves   another kind of inequality; but this argument does not render cultural  equality  meaningless.  Importantly,  the  idea  of  cultural  equality   applies  not  only  in  international  relations  but  also  in  cultural   practices  within  nation-states  or  a  single  cultural  community.  It  is   unjustifiable  for  one  state  or  one  community  to  use  the  slogan  of   external cultural equality to justify its practice of internal inequality.  To protect internal cultural equality is one effective way for a state or  community to win international support for the struggle for external  cultural equality.    Habermas  once  distinguished  between  culture  and  political  culture. While the former does not need to be shared by all citizens,  the  latter  is  marked  by  mutual  respect  for  rights.  Constitutional   democracy dedicates itself to this distinction by granting members of  minority cultures ‘equal rights of co-existence’ (Habermas, 1994). In  the  case  of  cultural  equality,  it  is  necessary  to  make  similar   distinctions between human beings and culture. A global citizen will  never  compromise  the  equality  between  human  beings  and  will  

 

 

 19

 always treat others as ends rather than means; but such equal respect  does  not  compromise  our  capacity  to  criticize  some  traditional   practices in other cultures. Human rights are now widely respected in  different  parts  of  the  world  and  by  different  cultural  societies.  This   provides  us  with  a  minimal  standard  whereby  we  can  engage  in   cultural  critique.  While  a  global  ethics  respects  different  cultures  it   does not retreat into them and become ossified. 

 Cultural equality is restricted by the human rights principle. All  cultures  are  accorded  equal  value  only  if  they  respect  or  honour   human  rights,  which  specify  that  governments  should  protect  their   own  people  and  should  not  kill  innocent  people.  Accordingly  it  is   illegitimate  for  any  one  culture  to  justify  torture  and  killing  on  the   basis  of  cultural  difference.  While  I  disagree  with  Barry’s  (2001,   p.127) arguments against equal respect for culture, I do endorse his  point  that  ‘Equal  respect  for  people  cannot  therefore  entail  respect   for their cultures when these cultures systematically give priority to,  say, the interests of men over the interests of women.’ 

 The  principle  of  human  rights  must  constitute  the  first  order of   culture,  and  define  the  basic  rules  with  which  all  cultures  must   comply.  Today  we  see  more  and  more  nation-states  endorsing  the   human  rights  principle;  but  there  remain  differences  in  the   interpretation  of  human  rights  and  different  understandings  of  how   strongly  human  rights  should  be  applied.  John  Rawls  (2001,  pp.79-80)  deals  well  with  this  issue  by  insisting  that  membership  in  the   Society  of  Peoples  requires  respect  for  a  list  of  human  rights   including the right to life, liberty, and security of the person; security  of  ethnic  groups  from  mass  murder  and  genocide;  rights  against   slavery  and  torture;  freedom  of  movement;  the  right  to  marry  and   start  a  family;  the  right  to  own  property;  the  right  to  freedom  of   conscience. These rights are universally applicable to liberal peoples  and  decent  hierarchical  peoples.  At  the  same  time,  Rawls  omits  the   freedom  of  speech  and  opinion,  the  freedom  of  assembly,  the   freedom to participate in governance and the right of equal access to  public  services,  the  right  to  the  free  choice  of  employment  and  to   non-discrimination in employment, and the right to education.    

 Inherent  Paradox  (II):  There  is  another  paradox.  One  may  hold  the   thesis  that  each  culture  should  enjoy  an  equal  right  to  use  its  

 

 

 20 

 language in global communication and that each language should be  regarded as equally valuable. Yet there are many who maintain that it  is  necessary  for  English  to  be  the  global  language.  According  to   Rosenau  (1997,  pp.88-9),  for  instance,  the  cultural  institution  of   English should be regarded as a universal functional control system  which offers a key to individual liberation within all cultures, despite 

 the fact that it gives rise to reactive linguistic nationalism. Indeed, it  can be conceded that even though global English language results in  an unequal status for other languages, it does make cultural dialogue  and  daily  communication  possible  and  this  is  particularly  important   in  the  case  of  transnational  activities  that  involve  different  peoples   who speak different languages. 

 Clearly,  multi-linguistic  practice  is  also  difficult  to  develop  for   economic  reasons.  Suppose,  for  instance,  the  Chinese,  Malay,  and   Indian  cultural  communities  in  Singapore  demand  their  cultural   languages as official ones, then communication between them would  require  interpretation;  but  how  would  these  cultural  communities   share the cost of interpretation? An apparent and easy solution is to  stick  to  a  common  official  language,  as  Singapore  has  done.  There,   as a colonial legacy, the official language is English and this seems  fair  to  all  ethnic  groups  despite  the  resentment  felt  by  the  older   Chinese. By contrast, where multi-ethnic countries, such as India and  Sri  Lanka,  have  abandoned  English  as  an  official  language  in  the   wake of their independence, cultural inequality and tension between  different ethnic groups has arisen. Interestingly, Malaysia attempted  to  introduce  English  as  a  teaching  language  for  science  and   mathematics  in  2002.   While  this  may  seem  an  equitable  language   arrangement it presents a problem for the Malaysian Chinese cultural  community,  implying  a  reduction  of  teaching  hours  for  Chinese   language in Chinese schools.   

 Strategies for Cultural Equality   

 Drawing  on  the  public/private  distinction,  Barry  (2001,  p.229)   provides a crucial argument against the claim that cultures should be  presumed  or  affirmed  to  be  equal  in  value.   Such  a  claim,  he   suggests, shifts matters that should be left to individual judgment into  the  realm  of  public  control.  In  his  view  the  state  has  no  right  to  

 

 

 21

 interfere  in  matters  of  individual  judgment.  Barry’s  position  is  to   leave  issues  of  cultural  equality  within  the  purview  of  individual   choice  and  to  reject  any  role  for  the  state.  Such  an  option  is   unacceptable.  Clearly  the  state  has  a  major  role  to  play  in   maintaining  neutrality  and  ensuring  maximal  cultural  equality.  In   contrast,  individuals  can  make  different  choices  and  enjoy  their   private  views  of  culture,  even  to  the  point  of  asserting  their  own   cultural  superiority,  providing  it  remains  in  the  private  sphere.   However,  any  such  public  assertions  or  acts  certainly  cannot  be   tolerated.  To  achieve  substantial  cultural  equality,  one  must  wage  a   ‘war’ against all cultural prejudice and bias at the level of both state  and  individual.  For  this  to  occur,  cultural  equality  must  be  a  public   matter. 

 For  Barry,  cultural  equality  is  ultimately  a  matter  of  individual   choice,  which  seems  a  weak  basis  for  its  realization.  Yet  does  that   mean  we  are  doomed  to  suffer  cultural  inequality  with  all  its   attendant  problems?  Surely  it  is  more  rational  to  prefer  cultural   equality  to  cultural  inequality.  If  so,  one  can  be  forgiven  for   attempting to develop strategies to overcome the apparent barriers to  realizing  cultural  equality.  Perhaps  this  is  the  pressing  task  for  a   global or intercultural citizen who values cultural equality: to aspire  to  build  a  culturally  equal  society  where  the  principle  of  cultural   equality becomes a powerful force for change.   We  can  identify  a  number  of  strategies  to  deal  with  the  

 paradoxes  of  cultural  equality.  The  challenging  question  is  how  to   avoid utopianism and persistently to search for realistic strategies for  cultural equality.    

 Negotiations over Cultural Difference and Equality    

 Rather  than  rejecting  the  idea  of  cultural  equality,  one  can   acknowledge  that,  although  we  cannot  resolve  or  eradicate  the   tension  or  contradictions,  we  can  reduce  the  tension  and  negotiate   between  the  universal  and  the  particular,  the  absolute  and  the   relative.  We  can  negotiate  over  cultural  difference  and  equality  to   develop  some  sort  of  minimal  overlapping  consensus.  Such  a   negotiation  strategy  offers  hope  as  a  useful  mechanism  towards   achieving  greater  cultural  equality.6  Each  culture,  recognizing  its  

 

 

 22 

 incompleteness, limits, and weaknesses, will engage in dialogue with  others,  learn  from  them,  and  so  an  overlapping  consensus  will   develop. As Andrew Linklater (1999, p.3) argues, what is needed ‘is  a  transnational  public  sphere  in  which  different  and  overlapping   moral  communities  can  all  have  an  input  into  the  decision-making   which affects them.’ 

 

 Self-Criticism as a Precondition for Cultural Equality   

 For  two  cultures  to  recognize  and  respect  each  other,  each  must  be   prepared  to  engage  in  mutual  criticism.  Just  as  genuine  friendship   involves  open  and  frank  criticism  and  advice,  mutual  criticism  

 between  cultures  is  a  crucial  element  of  cultural  equality  and  a   fruitful  way  to  develop  mutually  successful  relationships.   Importantly,  each  culture  must  be  prepared  to  subject  itself  to  both   external and internal criticism in order to help overcome cultural bias  and  prejudice  and  thus  improve  its  cultural  practice.  In  short,  each   culture must maintain a stance of critical self-reflection and criticism,  without which its claims to equal status lack legitimacy. 

 

 Cosmopolitan Virtue    

 It  is  not  beyond  the  realms  of  possibility  to  envisage  that,  in  an   increasingly interdependent world, the structures of each culture will  come  more  and  more  to  overlap  and  enmesh,  thereby  giving  rise  to   hybrid cultures that might display a preoccupation with cosmopolitan  thought and behaviour. In this way an intercultural perspective could  serve  to  endorse  and  support  multicultural  citizenship  because   individuals are able to hold membership of multiple cultures and thus  have access to shared culture and space. 

 Rather than polarizing the two extremes of Jihad and McWorld,  one  might  explore  the  possibility  of  some  sort  of  coexistence   between  the  two  that  furthers  an  intercultural  ethics  which   encourages mutual tolerance rather than mutual threat.  This idea is  usually  greeted  with  derision  and  skepticism because Jihad tends to  be  seen  merely  as  a  fundamentalist,  militaristic  movement  that   supports  terrorism.  Yet,  there  are  multiple  meanings  of  Jihad.   According  to  Patricia  Martinez  (2003),  University  of  Malaya,  Jihad  

 

 

 23

 should  be  understood  as  the  struggle  with  one’s  own  heart  and  the   attempt to bring oneself into accord with the will of God. The means  appropriate  to  this  struggle  are  prayer,  study,  and  various  forms  of   inner-worldly  asceticism.  A  more  nuanced  and  perhaps  sympathetic   understanding of Jihad is crucial to realizing any sort of coexistence  with  McWorld.  Islamic  fundamentalism  may  be  partially  explained   by  the  resentment  caused  by  a  sense  of cultural  inferiority  vis-Ã -vis  the  West’s  economic  and  political  domination.  Were  the  Muslim   world  to  experience  a  sense  of  cultural  equality  the  resentment   against Western culture would likely be reduced. 

 What is suggested here is that cosmopolitan virtue is a necessary  condition  for  realizing  cultural  equality.  In  the  current  climate  the   major  barrier  to  achieving  cultural  equality  is  that  attempts  to   preserve  certain  cultures  against  the  threats  of  Western  domination   are  all  tied  up  in  a  vicious  cycle  between  terrorism  and  the  war   against it. Yet surely violence and terrorism are not the civilized way  to  defend  the  existence  of  a  culture.  Equally  a  military  war  against   terrorism  is  most  likely  to  prove  unproductive  and  ineffective  in   restraining terrorism and even likely in the long run to provoke more  of it.  

 

 Developing Psychologically Complex Feelings of Ambivalence    

 Because there are contradictory impulses associated with notions of  cultural  equality,  psychologically  complex  feelings  of  ambivalence   are likely to occur. One might value cultural equality yet at the same  time  remain  sensitive  to  internal  inequality  and  the  multiplicity  of   issues involved.  Thus there is a need to develop skills to manage the  complexity  and  contradictions  associated  with  realizing  cultural   equality. Indeed, it is vital for a global citizen to see ‘contradictions’  as the driving force that enables the dialectical development of world  citizenship. It could even be said that the successful furtherance of a  politics  of  transnational  activism  depends  on  the  development  of  a   cross-cultural  psychology  that  is  able  to  deal  with  the  inevitable   problems that will arise from intercultural conflicts.  

 

 Bilingual or Multilingual skills    

 

 

 24 

 It  should  be  stressed  that  despite  the  paradox  of  the  equal  status  of   languages  discussed  in  the  last  section,  it  is  imperative  for  English   speaking  people  to  make  efforts  to  minimize  cultural  inequality  by   learning  other  languages.  Cultural  equality  requires  bilingual  or   multilingual  skills.  An  English  speaker  working  in  another  culture   needs to learn the language; to speaking an other language is not only  to show respect for other culture but also to have an opportunity of  participating in genuine cultural dialogue.    

 

 Conclusion   

 This  paper  has  defended  a  moderate  concept  of  cultural  equality.  It   has pointed out a number of serious problems with the equal starting  point of epistemology and the equal right to interpret culture. At the  same  time,  each  culture  deserves  the  right  to  equal  respect  and   consideration. And institutional arrangements need to be redesigned  to  ensure  cultural  equality  in  institutional  setting,  minimize  cultural   inequalities,  and  to  promote  the  equal  status  of  cultural  practice.   However,  all  cultures  are  accorded  equal  value  only  if  they  respect   and honour human rights. Cultural equality is restricted by the human  rights principle. It cannot be used to justify internal cultural practices  of inequality.  

 Inequality may have held sway throughout history while the idea  of  political  equality  is  in  its  infancy.  Although  political  equality  is   yet to be fully realized, the notion of cultural equality as a late comer  in  the  battle  for  equality cannot  be  ignored.  Indeed,  it  is  hoped  that   the idea of cultural equality serves to disrupt the normative discourse  of international relations at least for long enough to ensure it receives  serious consideration.

 APSA for his/her useful suggestions and comments. The paper  benefits from delightful conversations with Steven Lukes, Nic  Craith Mairead, Geoffrey Stokes, Wang Gungwu, and Benjamin  Wong.   2 By contrast, German citizenship was defined in terms of blood 

 and ethnic origin. Both French and German citizenships are  expressions of the contradiction of modern citizenship.  3 Such an argument was presented at the Workshop on ‘After Bali:  the Threat of Terrorism in Southeast Asia,’ organized by the 

 Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies, Nanyang  Technological University, Singapore, 27-28 January 2003.  4 Taken from his talk given at the East Asian Institute, National  University of Singapore, 2001.  5 George Grower (2002, pp.2-3, 49-54) distinguishes 

 incomparable, immeasurable, and unrankable; while it is  difficult to compare, measure and rank the total properties of  cultures, it is possible to compare, measure and rank certain  features of cultures.  6 Jacques Derrida (2001) has advocated the negotiation strategy as 

 a way of handling the internal contradiction of cosmopolitanism.
