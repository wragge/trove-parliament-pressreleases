  Minister Cobb expresses confidence in settlement services 

  The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affait, John Cobb, today expressed full confidence in  the settlement services provided ta new refagec: and humanitarian. arrivals to Ausb-alia. 

  He said organisations which provide these world-class settlement sewices were art hportant first step  in a person's arrival in their ncw homeland, particularly when they have been relocated h m  refbgee  camps or other desperate situations. 

  "Claims made about the levels of services prokided by the Australian Centre for Languages (ACL) to  thtee new arrivals b m  Afiicq Yeayea and Prjnms G b d e h ,  and Caroline Nykango, were first  brought to DIMIA's attention in early November and these matters have been investigated," Mr Cobb  said. 

  "As a result, adjustments have been made by the service provider to the type of povisions made  available for new arrivals, particularly as these relate to personal hygiene produds and food  vouchers," he said. 

  MI Cobb said the three African women were met upon arrival in Sydney and  driven to their temporary home in Newcastle c a  November 4. 

  The caseworkers guided the women around the property, gave them a food package and household  products for the next two days. Later in the day they helped the women register fiir Medicare, open a  bank account and arranged appointments with Centrelink. 

  "I understand that two of the women located f 5ends also living in Newcastle and went to stay with  them for the f h t  few days in Australia, said Mr Cobb. 

  "Settling into a new home in a new and straage country is not easy, especially when coming h m  a  refbgee camp or other harsh environments. 

  ''There are many new challenge that face refiigee and humanitarian arrivals and the extensive range  of support and assistance provided by the Australian Government helps people learn their new way of  Me. 

  "Since 1999 under a new funding program a rmge of organisations, including private companies,  state government agencies and non-governmeat Organisations including those thtd are church-based,  and/or volunteers, have provided settlement scwices.

  "By contracting settlement services, the govemnent and the taxpayers are assured of a level of  accountability governing the almost $50 million annual expenditure on refugee setllement services. 

  "Sewice specifications were designed in such a way as to encourage a wide range of service  providers, building on the valuable contribution ofthose already participating in the settlement  system, ill particular, volutlteers. 

  'The move to tendering for these services and tlie contractmg of providers followd consultation with  the community including with existing ~ ~ m m u r u t y  and non-government organisati3m. 

  "The arrangements which have been in ptace nc w since 1999 continue a long legac y of a partnership  approach between community volunteer groups and the service providers, 

  "The range of services the providers are contracted to provide new settlers include:  meeting them at airports and transporting them to their accommodation,  providing and securing interim accomnndation,  providing emergency assistance including access to emergency medical ant1 dental senices, 

  m f f ~ c y c l o t h i n g   the provision of food for at least the h i :  week aRer arrival or until income support i s   r e C e i V 4  

  infomation about government services :such as Centrelink, Medicare and English-language  lessons,  torture and trauma counselling,  introductions into the community including with like cornunities to enable them to meet 

  their specific religious and cultural needs, and  guidance on tenancy skills and the provision of a package of basic material goods to assist  in establishing a household. ~ 

  "As you can see fiom this list of services, the Government expects a lot of its service providers to  help new settlers' arrivals into a new life and a new country, and I am confident all of the service  providers are committed to maintaining a high level of service," the Minister added.
