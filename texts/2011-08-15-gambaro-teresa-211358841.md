 Speech: Italian Chamber of  Commerce celebrations marking  150 Years of Italian Unification Posted on Aug 15, 2011 in Speeches and Transcripts 

 Thank you so much for inviting me to be a part of these celebrations - what a great pleasure and honour it is for me to be here this evening, as the Shadow Parliamentary secretary for Citizenship and  Settlement and also on behalf of Mr Tony Abbott - Leader of the Federal  Opposition…but equally, as the daughter of Italian immigrants.

 May take this opportunity to congratulate ICCI Queensland, which has  shown a remarkable “can do” attitude that has contributed to its growth

 and positioning within the wider business community making it the most  pro-active international chamber of commerce in state.

 Through your vast network, you are ably assisting numerous businesses  to penetrate the Italian, Australian and world markets by identifying  potential counterparts willing to establish mutually beneficial relations.

 ICCI Queensland has strong links with the worldwide network of the  Italian Chambers of Commerce abroad, and works in close cooperation  with both Italian and Australian Government bodies.

 I have known Santo for many years on a personal level as well as our  time together in Federal Parliament. With Santo as President, the ICCI is  in good hands - he is a highly respected business man with a clear vision  for the future and his consulting business has a very strong international  flavour.

 We are privileged to have with us this evening Ambassador de  Montegiordano, who is a true Statesman. For those of you who are not  aware - in the past the Ambassador has been assigned to Seoul, London,  Moscow, Leningrad/St Petersburg, Paris, Baghdad and we are most  fortunate to have him now representing Italy here in Australia.

 Tonight’s Gala Dinner celebrates the 150th Anniversary of the  Unification of Italy - this year we remember and honour the courage,  sacrifice, and vision of the patriots who gave birth to the Italian nation.

 People are often surprised to know that as a nation-state, Italy is younger  than the United States and that the home of the ancient Roman empire  became a nation as a whole just 150 years ago.

 We are celebrating this significant event with friends and family from the  Italian community of Queensland, but no doubt, Italian communities  elsewhere in Australia and across the globe have been gathering together  to commemorate the il Risorgimento, or “The Resurgence”.

 On this very special occasion, we reflect on the legacy of Garibaldi and  all those who unified Italy, as well as the hundreds of thousands of  women and men of Italian descent who have strengthen and enriched this  country.

 Writer Dante Matelli said the idea of Italian nationhood was steeped in its  culture long before it became a political reality.

 Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said “Without unity our nation  would have been swept away by history.”

 As we mark this important milestone in Italian history, we also honor the  joint efforts of Australians and Italians closely tied by friendship and  common dedication to civil liberties, democratic principles, and the  universal human rights our countries both respect and uphold.

 We also celebrate our freedom, our humanitarian ideals, tolerance, and  the pursuit of liberty for all people - these principals are also important  priorities and policies for me and my colleagues in the Liberal Party.

 Italians have a long and proud history in this country, arriving in  Australia since the late eighteenth century, and have become a significant  influence the advancement of this country.

 The 2006 Census recorded that close to 200,000 Australians were born in  Italy, with almost 900,000 people identifying themselves as having Italian  ancestry.

 Italians arrived most prominently in the decades immediately following  the Second World War - they, their children and grandchildren have had  a significant impact on the cultural, social and economic life of Australia.

 Just like my own family experiences of Italian Immigration, there were so  many others who were refugees and displaced persons, seeking safety and  a place to start again.

 Australia needed a strong, young labour force, my forefathers and yours  built our roads, worked on major infrastructure projects such as the hydro -electricity schemes, harvested sugar cane, worked in mines, laboured and  later owned farms, and greatly contributed to the establishment of a wide  range of successful business and industrial enterprises.

 Personally, I am so immensely proud of the contribution of our immigrant  women, who often found their place in this strange land and culture so  isolating. Their determination to succeed and make a new life in this  country for their families, so greatly enhanced the development of  Australia’s cities and regional communities.

 Women have been, and continue to be, the glue that often holds our  immigrant communities together and Italian women from all walks of life  should be very proud of what they have achieved for this country.

 In 2011, we find hundreds if not thousands of people of Italian heritage  playing prominent roles in politics, business, sports, entertainment and  the arts.

 Many of those respected and well recognised people are present with us  this evening - there are too many of you to name individually…. I  applaud each and every one of you.

 In the political sphere - I would like to recognise the accomplishments of  colleagues such as Federal Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, Federal  MPs Ross Vasta and Steve Ciobo, and former member Phillip Barresi .

 Tonight may I also commend the outstanding achievements by political  identities such as activist and journalist B.A. Santamaria, Former Federal  Minister Con Sciacca - and of course our own Santo Santoro who is a  former Federal Minister and Senator.

 I am so very proud of the depth and breadth of the Italian culture that  enriches the Australian experience, and as the Shadow Parliamentary  Secretary for Citizenship and Settlement and International Development  Assistance.

 I thank you, and all those of Italian descent in Australia for your generous  contribution in making Australia a better and stronger nation.
