 Fourth boat arrival for 2012 is a warning that Labor must  hear

 Posted on Wednesday, 25 January, 2012

 The latest illegal boat arrival, carrying 74 passengers and 2 crew, is the fourth boat in only three weeks  since the new year, proving once again that the people smuggling business is showing no signs of  slowing in 2012, Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration & Citizenship and Shadow Minister for  Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said today. 

 "Four boats have arrived this year despite the heavy weather patterns that would normally deter people  smuggling at this time of year", Mr Keenan said. 

 "This should act as a warning to the Gillard Labor Government that 2012 is going to be a bonanza for  people smugglers unless they do something to stop this from happening" 

 "Tough measures are the only way to send the message to people smugglers that Australia will no  longer tolerate them being in charge over who comes to Australia" 

 "We know what these tough measures are and the sooner the Labor Party adopt the proven  prescription of the Coalition then the sooner we can close our borders to this evil trade," he said. 

 "The hard working men and women of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service have  spent this week cleaning up the mess created by the Gillard Government’s bad policy decisions. On  top of this Customs have also been tasked with collecting whaling protestors and have been forced to  work at this taxing tempo despite the heavy funding cuts that Labor has imposed upon them" 

 "How can the Gillard Government continue to justify the cuts they made to our border protection  agencies when they have been left to deal with the chaos that this incompetent Labor Government has  created? 

 "The Prime Minister was instructing others on what is responsible behaviour this week, yet her  Government have opened our borders to the people smugglers and abolished the Coalition’s border  protection policies that have proven to work," Mr Keenan said.
