 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales 

 

 Govt must put child's health ahead of politics 

 Senator Nettle, 31st July 2006  Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today called on the government not to send a  sick Afghan boy and his family to Christmas Island, but instead release them into the  community while their refugee claims are assessed.    

 "The Greens are very concerned that the government is prepared to put politics ahead  of this child's health by sending this family to remote Christmas Island away from  health services .    

 "I visited the Christmas Island detention centre earlier this year. It is extremely remote  and not an appropriate place to have a young child who has a serious medical  condition that may need urgent hospital attention.    

 "In answers to previous questions at Senate Estimates, the Department of Immigration  revealed that it costs $73,000 to medivac a patient from Christmas Island to the  mainland.    

 "The hospital on Christmas Island is small . For example, all pregnant women on  Christmas Island travel to the mainland in late pregnancy as a precaution.    

 "It is both morally and financially irresponsible to move this family to Christmas  Island, or Nauru for that matter.    

 "Commonsense and the child's health should prevail in this case and the government  should let this family live in the community while their asylum claims are assessed."
