 Media Release: Time for Turnbull to come clean on US deal 

 November 14, 2016 

 The federal government's must end its secrecy over its "deal" with the United States to resettle refugees  from Manus Island and Nauru.   

 "The government's lack of information about this arrangement is causing significant anxiety to people  detained on Manus Island and Nauru," Greens Immigration spokesperson Nick McKim said.   

 "Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull needs to reveal how many people will be resettled in the United  States, under what conditions, and how long will it take."   

 “He should also reveal what he intends to do with people who will not be covered by the arrangement.”  “Some people detained on Manus Island and Nauru have family in Australia, and the government has  to date offered no hope for reunification.”   

 "We know that offshore detention is a dead end - the government has now conceded this. We have to  ensure that no man, woman or child is left to languish there."
