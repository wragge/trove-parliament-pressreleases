 CRIMINAL DEPORTATION POLICY

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,

 Mr Stewart W e s t ,  today made a major statement to 

 Parliament regarding criminal deportation policy.

 Speaking outside the House,  Mr West pointed out the 

 need for urgency in this matter.

 "There are currently 180 unexecuted deportations which 

 were ordered by the previous Minister," said Mr West

 "Many of these are needing urgent review and a 

 substantial number are before either the Administrative 

 Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court."

 "Also, there are about 250 people finishing sentences, 

 at the moment who could be affected by deportation -  ·

 decisions."

 Mr West said there was a fine balance to be considered 

 between obligations under international law, human 

 rights and humanitarian considerations and the genuine 

 right for community protection against criminal 

 behaviour.

 "We must always take into account the legitimate rights 

 of an individual," said Mr West.

 In his statement, Mr West stressed that h i s .comments - .

 referred to those persons who were permanent residents 

 of Australia but who were not Australian citizens. -  He -.../2

 t '

 2 .

 was not speaking about people who were illegally or 

 temporarily in Australia. -

 "There are four broad criteria which the Government will 

 take into account when considering deportation for non- . .  

 Australian citizens who are sentenced to jail for any 

 offences listed in my statement," said Mr West.

 These were the nature of the crime,  the possibility of 

 recidivism, the contribution that person may make to the 

 community or may be reasonably expected to make in the 

 future and the family and/or social ties that already exist.

 Crimes against children,  certain drugs offences relating 

 to "hard" addictive substances,  organized criminal '  ,

 activity and serious sexual offences were identified by 

 Mr West as some of the offences which could render 

 non-Australian citizens liable to deportation.

 Mr West also signalled the Government’s intention to 

 amend the Migration A c t .in a way which would create 

 equity and consistency in criminal deportation policy.

 "Sections 12 and 1 3 -of the Migration Act discriminate ....

 against persons of non-Commonwealth status," said Mr West.

 "They are always liable to criminal deportation until 

 Australian citizenshipN is acquired in contrast to 

 persons of Commonwealth nations who are subject to 

 deportation only in respect of crimes committed within 

 five years of any entry into Australia."

 Mr West said the policy of the previous Government was 

 inconsistent with the present Government’s policy of 

 removing discrimination between different foreign nationals.

 "It is the Government’s policy that non-Australian 

 citizens permanently resident in Australia should .. 

 cease to be liable to deportation after a specified - —

 period of residence," said Mr West. .

 "We will be introducing legislation not later than the 

 Budget session."

 "Today's statement and the foreshadowed-amendments will- -  

 create a policy and legislative package under which 

 consistent, firm, just and humane decisions will be .  

 made on these sensitive matters." . .

 MINISTERIAL STATEMENT: CRIMINAL DEPORTATION POLICY

 BY THE HON. STEWART WEST, MP, MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  â¢  ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 Mr Speaker

 For the information of Honourable Members I present a  statement on the Government's criminal deportation policy.

 I am concerned that under the previous Government  inconsistencies became apparent in the determination of  criminal deportations. I propose therefore to inform the  House of policy which, under this Government, will guide  decisions under the Migration Act when considering the  possible deportation of non-Australians convicted of  specified criminal conduct.

 At the outset I shall make it clear that I refer here to  the deportation liability of people who are not Australian  ditizens but are permanent residents of Australia. My  remarks do not apply to people who are in Australia 

 temporarily or illegally when they commit criminal  offences; their possible deportation would be considered  under policies and legislative provisions for expelling  illegal immigrants.

 I should also make it clear that deportation is not  imposed as a punishment and must not in any sense be  regarded as a punishment.  It is not for the Minister for  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to form opinions as to the  adequacy or otherwise of the sentence imposed by the  Courts for the offences committed. I accept that  expulsion from Australia can produce one degree or another  of hardship. Nevertheless, although the Government's  policy is humane and compassionate, I emphasise that 

 individual deportees should bear responsibility for the  consequences of their own criminal conduct.

 As I will discuss later, the purpose of deporting a  criminal is to protect the safety and welfare of the  Australian community and to exercise a choice on behalf of  the community. This is not to say that all  non-Australians convicted of particular types of crimes  will automatically be deported. *

 Sections 12 and 13 of the Migration Act discriminate  against persons of non-Commonwealth status. They are  always liable to criminal deportation until Australian  citizenship is acquired in contrast to persons of  Commonwealth nations who are subject to deportation only 

 in respect of crimes committed within five years after any  entry to Australia.

 2

 Clearly this is inconsistent with the Government's policy  or removing discrimination between different foreign  nationals. It is also inconsistent with the Government's  policy that all non-Australian citizens permanently 

 resident in Australia should cease to be liable to  deportation after a specified period of residence.

 The Government will be introducing amendments to the  Migration Act to give effect to these policies. I now  detail the Government's criminal deportation policy to the  House. ---

 POLICY ON CRIMINAL DEPORTATION

 INTRODUCTION

 1. The Australian Government, on the behalf of the  Australian community, has the right to decide who will be  accepted for permanent residence in Australia and,  ultimately, for absorption into full membership of the  community by way of Australian citizenship.

 2. t  Parliament vests in the Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs the discretion to determine whether  resident non-Australian citizens who have been convicted  in Australia of certain major criminal conduct are to be  removed from Australia by deportation. In exercising that  discretion the Minister is exercising the right of the 

 Australian community to be protected and to choose who  will be permitted to remain a permanent resident.

 3. A person who has come within the criminal 

 deportation liability has a right to a decision on his/her  case as soon as possible after sentencing and a right to  appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against a  decision that he/she be deported.

 4. It is the policy of the Australian Government that  recommendations of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  should be overturned by the Minister only in exceptional  cricumstances and only when strong evidence can be  produced to justify his decision. Furthermore, it is the  policy of the Government that, when the Minister decides  tp deport a person contrary to a recommendation of the  Tribunal, the Minister will table in the Parliament at the  first opportunity a statement of his/her reasons for doing  so.

 3

 5. The Government recognises Australia's obligations under international law, particularly the International  Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It has taken into  consideration views expressed by the Human Rights  Commission. However, the Government is mindful of the 

 need to balance a number of very important factors,  especially:

 . the need for community protection,against criminal behaviour? ""

 . the requirement to take into consideration the legitimate human rights of an individual?

 . the need to protect the rights of other persons, including the family of the person concerned? and

 . the need to avoid discrimination when making deportation decisions.

 GUIDELINES FOR DEPORTATION .

 (5. The purpose of deporting a person who has been convicted of a criminal offence in Australia is to protect  the safety and welfare of the Australian community and to  exercise a choice on behalf of the community that the  benefit accruing to the community as a whole by his/her 

 removal outweighs the hardship to the persons concerned  and his/her family.

 7. The greater the potential effect on the community or the greater the potential damage to the community the lower is the acceptable level of risk that the person  concerned will commit further offences.

 8. Deportation of a person convicted of crime may- be  appropriate when a person:

 . constitutes a threat because there is a risk he/she will commit further offences if allowed to remain?

 or

 , has committed a crime so offensive to Australian community standards that the community rebels  against having within it a person who has committed  such an offence?

 or

 4 -

 . has not established sufficient ties with Australia to have become a full member of the community and,  by reason of his/her conduct, is unsuitable for  permanent residence in Australia.

 9. Examples of serious offences which may render non-rAustralian citizens liable to deportation include;

 , production, importation, distribution, trafficking  or commercial dealing in heroin or other "hard"  addictive drugs or involvement in other illicit  drugs on a significantly large scale (persons who  embark upon drug-related crime for financial gain 

 Show a callous disregard for insidious effects on  the health and welfare of Australia's young  people) ; this does not necessarily apply to persons  who use hard drugs for their own consumption who  were not involved in the above illegal actions;

 ,, organised criminal activity (whether within Australia only or internationally);

 , serious sexual assaults whether or not accompanied by other violence (especially where there has been  more than one sexual offence) ;

 . armed robbery;

 . violence against the person;

 .  terrorist activity and assassination;

 , kidnapping;

 . blackmail ;

 . extortion.

 primes against children, because of their vulnerability,  take on a special significance, especially inducement to  drugs, sexual assaults, violence, kidnapping and crimes  taking unfair advantage of children.

 j.0. Social ties developed after the liability for  deportation arose, especially after the liability had been  brought to the notice of the offender, can be discounted  according to circumstances (eg marriage or the immigration 

 to Australia of further family members).

 5

 11. Australia does not have an obligation to provide  sanctuary for people who have broken the laws of another  country. In any case it is neither feasible nor proper  for the Australian Government to consider the propriety of 

 the operation of criminal codes in other countries nor,  even if it had the resources to obtain sufficient  information, to attempt to anticipate the likely outcome  of any charges overseas.

 12. Thus the possibility of further criminal sanctions  in the country in which a potential deportee expects to  live if deported are generally not relevant to the main  issue of protecting the Australian community and may not  be persuasive when making a decision on deportation.

 13. Civil or military hostilities are more likely to  effect the timing of a deportation than to constitute  reason that the offender should continue to live  permanently in Australia.

 14. Judgements that job opportunities and the overall  environment of the country to which a person would be  deported are not as favourable to them as in Australia,  however compassionately viewed, would not be persuasive  againsf the removal of a person who is a risk to the  Australian Community.

 15. Cogent and substantiated evidence of any claim of  likely persecution in the country to which a person is to  be deported would need to be produced. In the absence of  such evidence it is very difficult to give any weight to 

 the unsubstantiated claim.

 16. The most important broad criteria on which  judgements will be based are the nature of the crime; the  possibility of recidivism; the contribution that the  person has made to the community or may reasonably be 

 expected to make in the future and the family and/or  social ties that already exist. In particular the  following factors will be taken into account when making a  decision on whether a deportation order should be issued:

 . the nature of the offence as outlined in

 paragraph 9 and the length of sentence imposed by  the Court;

 . the person's previous general record and conduct;

 . the risk of further offences; .

 6

 . the extent of rehabilitation already achieved, the prospect of further rehabilitation and positive  contribution to the community the person may  reasonably be expected to make;

 . the length of lawful residence in Australia, the strength of family, social, business and other ties  in Australia;

 . the degree of hardship which would be caused to

 lawful residents of Australia (especially  Australian citizens) known to be affected adversely  by deportation or conversely the extent of support 

 for deportation from persons directly affected;

 . any unreasonable hardship the offender would suffer;

 . ties with other countries;

 . the relevant obligations of the Commonwealth of '  Australia under international treaties ratified by the Australian Government;

 . the likelihood that deportation of the offender · â   woqld prevent or inhibit the commission of like  offences by other persons.

 This list is not exhausive; if relevant, other factors  that come to notice will be taken into account in  individual cases.

 CLAIMS FOR REFUGEE STATUS

 17. The cases of persons who seek recognition as  'Convention1  refugees pursuant to the Convention and  Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees are considered  individually by the Minister. Advice is usually drawn  from the Determination of Refugee Status (DORS) Committee. It investigates and recommends to the Minister  whether the person concerned should be recognised as a 

 refugee for the purpose of the Convention and Protocol and  whether he/she is entitled to the protection of the  Convention.

 DEPORTATION ACTION

 18. It is for the appropriate State authorities (or in  the case of Commonwealth prisoners, the Governor-General)  to decide such questions as the conditions under which a  prisoner is to serve a sentence, the extent of remission

 7

 of any part of a sentence or the release of a potential  deportee on licence or on parole or for the purpose of  deportation.

 19. Whenever possible, departure from Australia will be  arranged to coincide with a deportee's release from  prison. A deportee may be held in custody pursuant to the  Migration Act pending finalisation of the deportation  arrangements.
