 Counting the Costs of War - The Changed NGO Environment  Jenny Wells, Australian Council for International Development   

 Introduction  I have been asked to speak about the challenges facing NGOs in the current global  environment. This presentation will also explore several key issues facing all of us involved in  conflict and post-conflict interventions and concludes that “an important measure of the  effectiveness of an intervention should not be how quickly peace is restored but how quickly  peace can be sustained locally without the presence of external forces”.     

 First I’d like to briefly introduce ACFID, clarify some frequently used terms that NGOs use and  take a brief look at the changed global environment from an NGO perspective.  Following that I  will present two key challenges that this changed environment poses for NGOs and finally I’d  like to share with you some lessons learned and conclusions.   

 Who are we?  The Australian Council for International Development is an association of over 80 Australian  NGOs working in international aid and development and our key roles are to:  â¢ Develop and promote standards of best practice among Australian NGOs 

 â¢ Represent the interests of members to government and other organisations and   â¢ Coordinate effective policy dialogue and advocacy among Aust NGOs.   

 In 2002 Australian NGOs channelled more than $500 million into international aid and  development programs and to community education programs in Australia.  â¢ 65% of this is provided by the Australian public,  â¢ 18% is from Australian govt funding through AusAID and 

 â¢ the remainder comes from other donor organisations including the UN.   

 Definitions  I think it is important to clarify frequently used terminology such as ‘humanitarian’, ‘security’ and  ‘governance’ as these terms are used by different stakeholders to mean different things.  These  definitions are not internationally acknowledged but rather an attempt to articulate what we in  the NGO community mean by these terms.   

 The use of the term ‘humanitarian’ in the context of providing assistance to people means that  assistance is provided on the basis of need and independent of any political, economic or  military objective.   NGOs argue that it is not just how and to whom assistance is delivered that  matters but also by whom.  Assistance provided by states, using the military, or other  stakeholders that are there to deliver assistance on behalf of a state cannot be called  ‘humanitarian’ as it is neither independent nor impartial.      

 ‘Humanitarian space’ is that space where humanitarian assistance is provided on the basis of  need and is delivered with impartiality.   Humanitarian space is ‘owned’ by humanitarian  agencies and actors and extends from their inherent values of independence and impartiality.   Military forces’ movement into ‘humanitarian space’ blurs the distinction between humanitarian  and military actors, and increases the risk of introducing conflicting humanitarian and military 

 objectives.  Thus compromising the roles of both parties.   

 Human security is based on what we all need for a life with dignity.  It includes personal  protection and safety, access to adequate food, water and shelter, gainful employment  opportunities and the ability and opportunity to participate in decision-making processes that  affect you. It focuses on the widest possible range of people having enough confidence in their  future.

 State security is based on the respect and promotion of the rule of law including protection from  violence, abuse, torture and trafficking.    

 Good governance is a process that fosters accountable management of a state both at the  institutional and civil society levels.  It includes the participation of all citizens and state  responsibility to provide both human and state security.      

 The changed global environment  The Sept 11 attack, followed by Bali and Madrid, have highlighted the fragility of peace in the  face of growing inequality and enormous poverty.  Although more people than ever have  access to information and essential social goods, the gap between rich and poor countries  and  between wealthy and destitute people has never been greater than today.  The exclusion and  deprivation of whole communities from the benefits of development naturally contributes to the  tensions, violence and conflict within countries.  A consequence of this is today we have more  people displaced and more people affected by conflict than ever before.  This is a sobering  reminder of the current collective inability of globalisation to prevent prejudice, persecution,  poverty and other root causes of conflict and displacement.    

 At the same time, state security is facing new challenges reflecting the changing international  and national environments. Internal conflicts have overtaken interstate wars as the major threat  to international peace and security while the globalisation process has deeply transformed  relationships between and within states.   Additionally, the increase in conflict and displacement  around the world demonstrates the ineffectiveness of military strategies as a primary means of  creating global security.  As we find ourselves in an increasingly insecure global environment  despite a massive global arms budget, it is clear that current spending on defence, despite  substantial increases is not, and will never be enough to ensure state security.    

 To achieve peace and security in today’s interdependent world, we must not only prevent and  mitigate the impact of internal violent conflicts but also uphold human rights and pursue  inclusive and equitable development that respects human dignity and diversity.  Of crucial   importance is to develop the capability of individuals and communities to make informed  choices and to act on their own behalf if peace and security are to be sustained.  In many  respects human security requires including those people excluded, whether by displacement or  by poverty, by reducing their vulnerability and marginalisation.    

 Essentially, this means that sustainable peace or state security is dependent on human security  while human security cannot be achieved without state security.  If an intervention is not  balanced in its priorities of providing both state security and building human security, then  neither the national/global security or the sustainable development objectives of states will be  achieved.     

 The ‘War on Terror’ has adopted the language of exclusion and division rather than inclusion  and cohesion, polarizing the world and it’s people into friend versus foe, good versus bad,  oppressed versus liberators, either with us or against us.  It has effectively reduced, if not  eliminated, any opportunity for independent action by states and civil society including NGOs.   This polarization has reduced both the political and operational space available to organizations  and individuals to engage in mainstream decision making with those in power.  It has also  effectively compelled individuals and communities around the world to take sides and to  express allegiance to one belief or leader, good or bad, when many have no real freedom to  make a free and informed choice.  This has only strengthened the capacity of those willing to  use violence to increase their support base.   

 The challenges facing ANGOs  I’m now going to focus on two key challenges that are facing Australian NGOs in today’s  changing global environment:   

  3

 â¢ The first is responding to the Australian government’s concerns to address state  security through a ‘Whole of Government’ approach and  â¢ The second is the implications for NGOs of political incursions into ‘humanitarian  space’.    

 Specifically I’m going to look at the ‘Whole of Government’ approach to state security  and its impact on development effectiveness.   At the start of the 21st century, we are at a dangerous cross road.  In response to the threat of  terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction, states may revert to a narrower  understanding of state security at the expense of fostering human security, thereby questioning  the credibility and legitimacy of multilateral institutions and strategies.  Under the guise of  waging a war against terrorism we are seeing human rights and humanitarian law being 

 violated at a time when we need them the most.     

 Development aid and global security agendas are converging and there is growing evidence  that donors are, to a greater extent, shaping their development cooperation priorities through  the lens of the ‘war on terrorism’ (Reality of Aid 2004, p27).  The United States supported their  September 2002 National Security Strategy with a foreign aid policy statement Foreign Aid in  the National Interest, which substantially linked national security and foreign assistance. The  Australian Government’s Ministerial Statement (November, 2003) did similar, stating that “Our  aid is contributing in no small part to Australia’s national interest by helping create those  conditions essential for enhanced regional stability and security, and poverty reduction.”    

 At the same time an ever-increasing proportion of Official Development Assistance or ODA is  being spent by government agencies without a mandate to provide international aid under a  ‘Whole of Government’ approach.  This emphasis on security and the correlated whole-of-government approach is starkly reflected in the recent Federal aid budget announcement for  2004-05. Of the total ODA figure of $2.133 billion announced, $432.4m are ODA-eligible funds  managed by government departments other than AusAID; an increase of $177m over the last  year and representing 74% of the overall increase in the aid program of $239m. (ACFID Aid  Budget Analysis). The scarce aid funds that remain in Australia’s budget are in danger of  increasing diversion to ‘whole of government’ priorities, particularly with regard to national  security (Spillane, 2004b).   

 NGOs have expressed concern that the recentDevelopment Assistance Committee (DAC)  paper, A Development Cooperation Lens on Terrorism Prevention: Key Entry Points for Action  (April 2003), and the trend in donor thinking it reflects, opens the door for terrorism prevention  increasingly becoming a goal of development cooperation in its own right (Spillane, 2004b).    Any attempt to reclassify a larger share of such interventions as aid could easily lead to abuse  and divert scarce ODA resources towards military purposes with a much more debatable  development impact (Rogerson et al, 2004). ACFID advocates for an increase in the aid  program to build human security.  We believe that Australia’s national security is strongly  dependent on the human security of people globally. That is, alongside the responsibilities of  states to protect citizens from threats of violent action, there must be concerted effort to  address the causes of instability and vulnerability, namely poverty and weak state capacity to  protect human rights.     

 The second challenge I’d like to raise is what happens when ‘Humanitarian space’  ceases to exist?  In both Complex Humanitarian Emergencies and natural disasters, humanitarian agencies are  increasingly finding themselves working in contexts where military forces are also present.   Within this context, the military has, to varying degrees, become involved in providing relief  assistance.  As a result, a number of trends, both positive and negative, have become  apparent: 

 â¢ in recent conflicts some military forces have provided support and security for the  activities of humanitarian agencies 

  4

 â¢ however humanitarian workers are increasingly becoming a target in conflict settings as  the distinction between humanitarian and military actors becomes blurred  â¢ military forces are increasingly engaging in the direct provision of assistance in  response to humanitarian needs.  â¢ the pursuit of ‘humanitarian’ objectives is increasingly being used as a justification for 

 military intervention.    

 Military movement into what has traditionally been ‘humanitarian space’ raises significant  issues of principle as well as policy and operational questions for humanitarian agencies.   

 In any humanitarian emergency it is likely that humanitarian agencies and militaries will have  common objectives based on providing life saving assistance to communities in need as well as  a mutual interest in establishing and maintaining the peace.  However it is also true that NGOs  and militaries will have competing objectives and priorities.  The key to creating a supportive  and cooperative working environment where both militaries and NGOs can achieve their  objectives in a cohesive manner - thus providing the best possible assistance to the people in  need lies first in understanding and respecting the important role each plays.     

 There are profound differences between the mandates and principles of formal military forces  and humanitarian agencies.  Once the political decision has been made by a State to contribute  to a peace intervention, the military has a core mandate to foster security and protect civilians 

 by establishing and enforcing a safe stable environment.  Humanitarian agencies have a  mandate to directly implement humanitarian aid programs based on clear humanitarian  principles.  Without a secure environment NGOs are unable to operate effectively while a lack  of peace impedes development creating further economic and social divisions.  It is essential  for the sustainable fulfilment of the mandates of both parties that these two roles - impartial  humanitarian assistance and peace interventions with their inevitable partial and political  mandates are distinguished.    

 Having a clear understanding and respect for our distinct roles and mandates should form the  basis of a complementary operational relationship.  This doesn’t mean that the roles of NGOs,  other humanitarian agencies and militaries become entwined.  What it does mean is that by first  being clear and understanding each others mandates and identifying exclusive and common  objectives we can better achieve all of our objectives.  NGOs are by definition, non-government. They are not responsible for implementing government policy, including foreign  policy. NGOs accept government funds to do humanitarian work consistent with the NGOs  purpose.  If they receive government funding, it should be given in recognition of the NGOs  ability to work in partnership with local people, to promote human rights and assist towards  poverty eradication.     

 A recent study by International Council for Voluntary Agencies raised several key issues to do  with the increasing presence of military forces and the independence of NGOs.  It states that  the debate on the role of military forces in the provision of humanitarian assistance is now  entering new ground and raises a challenge for NGOs in terms of what should be the  relationship between humanitarian agencies and military forces that are taking part in the  hostilities?  In addressing this issue humanitarian agencies look to the key principles of  neutrality, impartiality and independence and consensus is building around a belief that a  military force that is party to the conflict cannot maintain these principles and should therefore  not encroach on the humanitarian domain.   

 This collective understanding by NGOs is being further informed by various reports looking at  responses to recent emergencies.  Anecdotal reports from Afghanistan on problems emerging  resulting from military-provided assistance are now emerging.  Some reports speak of coalition  teams offering free services in communities, undermining cost sharing arrangements that  NGOs had been working on for years.  Others tell of needs assessments conducted by male

 military personnel who never met with women and had little or no historical knowledge of the  communities with which they were engaging.       

 Additionally, given that military forces are there as a very clear political response by a state or  by the UN, questions will always be asked about the motives of why the military are providing  relief assistance.  No clearer example can be given than the response by the US in dropping  food parcels and cluster bombs at pretty much the same time in Afghanistan. The critical issue  became the inability to distinguish between either life-saving assistance or devastating 

 destruction - both yellow and both dropped from the same source.    

 In the recent MSF publication, In the Shadow of War, they state that the term humanitarian  when employed to describe food airdropped or food aid and bottled water supplied by allied  troops is fundamentally propaganda.  Under the laws of armed conflict, it is the responsibility of  the occupying power to meet the vital needs of the population and treat prisoners properly.   These are legal obligations, not humanitarian gestures.  For an act to be humanitarian, it should  be freely given and be neither obliged by law nor owed as compensation for harm done.  Giving  people goods of which we ourselves deprived them is not a donation, but restitution.   Humanitarian law records this fact.   

 How does this impact on NGO safety?  In emergencies, NGOs are able to negotiate access to civilians on all sides of the conflict.   NGOs often have long experience and established local networks in place before an  emergency occurs and depend on the trust based on existing relationships with local  communities to gain access and provide assistance to communities in need.  By ensuring the  principles of humanity, independence, impartiality and local ownership, NGOs gain acceptance  and access to populations most at risk.  The core principles of the humanitarian imperative,  impartiality and NGO independence, as laid out in the Sphere Humanitarian Charter and the  Code of Conduct for Red Cross and NGOs in Disaster Relief form the foundation of NGO  operational policy. For example, Clause 4 in the Code of Conduct for the Red Cross and NGOs  states that “We shall endeavour not to act as instruments of government foreign policy”.    

 Being seen or perceived to be working with the military changes the local population’s  understanding of where NGOs stand and threatens this relationship.  When NGOs are  perceived to be part of one side of another they become targets of aggression as has been  seen in the case of UN staff in Iraq and NGO staff in Afghanistan.  Another important aspect is  that once peace is restored, NGOs will revert to undertaking long term development programs  while the military withdraws.  If NGOs are not careful about ensuring real and perceived  impartiality the effectiveness of important social development programs can be adversely 

 affected.       

 Humanitarian action must form the foundation for ongoing long term sustainable  development  and not be seen to be a stand-alone, short term response.  Humanitarian assistance should  help lay the groundwork for social and economic development aimed at re-establishing or  strengthening human security.  Thus providing the foundation for sustainable peace and  promote state security.   

 Humanitarian agencies such as UN agencies, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and  NGOs agree that humanitarian action is of little value if it does not form part of a wider strategic  and political framework aimed at addressing the root causes of conflict including poverty, lack  of economic opportunity, inequitable resource distribution, discrimination and poor governance.  As previous High Commissioner for UNHCR, Mrs Ogata, stated “Without human security, there  can be no peace and stability”. 1  Few situations better reflect this need than the ongoing  Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

 To conclude I’d like to share some lessons learned and some policy considerations from  an NGO perspective.     Some of the operational lessons learned by Australian NGOs from recent experiences can be  summarised as follows:   

 Better Coordination  The need for coordination reflects the complexity of the context in which both militaries and  NGOs are operating in and the multiple players involved.     

 Respect and Dialogue between Actors  There needs to be proper acknowledgement by militaries, governments & UN agencies of the  key role NGOs play in social development, stability and rebuilding of civil society after crisis.   

 Protection should be a Core Component of Relief Interventions  All actors should make protection a part of every needs assessment.  They should always  calculate and minimise the potential negative side-effects of relief interventions.     

 Better Dissemination of International Humanitarian Law  All actors should undertake better dissemination of IHL in all their activities. An internationally  respected and applied rules-bound system to protect human rights forms the foundation for  building sustainable human security.    

 Greater Understanding of the Role of Civil Society  A strong and accountable civil society is one of the core catalysts for ensuring state security.   Governments need to view their international aid programs as an important tool for  strengthening civil society by promoting accountable governance at all levels.  This will result in  more effective conflict prevention and more rapid and sustainable rehabilitation - something  that the defence program is unable to do.   

 Conclusions:  As stated in the introduction, an important measure of the effectiveness of an intervention  should not be how quickly peace is restored but how quickly peace can be sustained locally  without the presence of external forces.     

 This is largely dependent on the strength of local civil society to rebuild responsible political,  judicial and military institutions and to be able to hold them accountable to the needs of the  people.  This can  take many years or possibly decades, as in the case of Iraq, and has to be  based on strong community development principles of equity, participation and local ownership.     

 Today there is a need for more engagement and dialogue between governments and civil  society actors, not less.  Australian NGOs, despite the negative political environment they work  in characterized by increased scrutiny and threats to funding, have continued to build strong  relationships with a number of Government departments including ADF, EMA, DFAT, AusAID,  DIMIA and the AFP.  A ‘Whole of Government’ framework offers potential for this engagement  to really ‘value-add’ to both the state security agenda and build real human security through the  government’s aid program.  However, to achieve this, government’s need to not only respect  the role of civil society and protect ‘humanitarian space’ but also ensure that Whole of  Government priorities strike the right balance between protecting state security and fostering  human security.   

 Thank you
