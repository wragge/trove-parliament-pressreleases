 MEDIA RELEASE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER  

 DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT -  AMBASSADOR FOR PEOPLE SMUGGLING ISSUES   

 FA159          19  December  2005  

 

 I have announced today the appointment of Lydia Morton as Australia’s Ambassador for  People Smuggling Issues.  Ms Morton replaces Ms Caroline Millar, who has been  Ambassador since July 2003.  The appointment will take effect immediately and reaffirms the  Government’s strong commitment to regional cooperation in combating people smuggling,  trafficking in persons and related transnational crime. 

 The Ambassador for People Smuggling Issues is responsible for high-level advocacy of  Australia's interests in promoting effective and practical international cooperation to combat  people smuggling and trafficking in persons, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.  

 In this role Ms Morton will promote a coordinated, whole-of-government approach to the  continued implementation of the outcomes of the successful second Regional Ministerial  Conference on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime,  held in Bali from 29 to 30 April 2003.  She will also work closely with other Governments,  notably Indonesia (as co-chair) and with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees and the International Organization for Migration, to implement the practical  measures agreed to by Ministers at the Conference, including by promoting regional and  international cooperation on these measures between relevant operational agencies.   

 Ms Morton is currently First Assistant Secretary, International Organisations and Legal  Division.  Prior to taking up this position she was First Assistant Secretary, North Asia  Division (2004-05).  Ms Morton has served overseas as Deputy Head of Mission, Australian  Embassy, Beijing (2000-03), Counsellor, Australian Embassy, Paris (1994-97), Counsellor,  Australian Embassy, Seoul (1988-90), and Third Secretary, Australian Embassy, Brussels  (1974-77). 

 In Canberra, Ms Morton has served as Assistant Secretary, East Asia Branch (1999-2000),  Assistant Secretary, Diplomatic Security Branch (1998-99), Director, Administrative and  Domestic Law Group (1997-98) and Director, Audit and Evaluation Section (1991-93).  

 Ms Morton is a graduate of the University of Melbourne (BA Hons) and the Australian  National University (LLB).  She speaks French, Chinese and German.  She has three  daughters.
