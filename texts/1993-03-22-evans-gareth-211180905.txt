 UN PEACEKEEPING AT THE CROSSROADS

 Speech by Senator the Hon Gareth Evans QC, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, to open the International Peacekeeping Seminar, Canberra, 22 March 1993.

 This seminar should offer all of us who have an active involvement and interest in peacekeeping the opportunity to develop further our ideas about the future of UN peacekeeping and how its operation might be improved. Given the extraordinary challenges

 facing the international community in trying to secure peace in the post—Cold War era, we

 should use the opportunity of this seminar and its broadly based participation to look at the

 relationship between peacekeeping and the broader collective security mandate of the international community, and how peacekeeping and collective security can generally be made more complementary and mutually reinforcing.

 Australia has participated in eleven UN peacekeeping operations to date, and we have been a member of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations since its inception. The

 current historically unprecedented level of Australian contribution to peacekeeping operations

 underlines our own dedication to the success of peacekeeping generally. We are presently contributing large forces to UNTAC in Cambodia and UNITAF in Somalia, and have smaller

 contingents with UNOSOM, MR URSO, UNFICYP, UNPROFOR and UNTSO. We have also contributed personnel to collective security  activity other than through peacekeeping operations, such as through the Mine Clearance Training Team in Pakistan and UNSCOM in Iraq. Australia's role in peacekeeping will be described in more detail by Major—General

 Blake later in the Seminar.

 As the title of this Seminar states, UN peacekeeping is at the crossroads. We are at the

 crossroads because the end of the Cold War has brought with it complex challenges to

 international security.  On the one hand there has been increasing multipolarity, interdependence of nations and enhanced credibility for — and expectations of — the UN. But on the other hand there have been increasing humanitarian crises; ethnic conflicts within (and spilling over) national borders; breakups of states; a growing appreciation of the

 unsustainability over the longer term of expecting one superpower, or even a small group of powerful countries, to act as the world's policeman; and evident difficulties in the UN meeting

 in practice the expectations placed upon it. The world is not a more peaceful place, and

 existing mechanisms at the international, regional and national level are simply not coping effectively with the post Cold War challenges to security.

 There is nonetheless a new willingness to explore the extent of the Security Council's mandate to ensure international security, and especially through peacekeeping operations. There are currently thirteen UN peacekeeping operations under way involving 55,000 troops contributed by UN Member States. This figure could shortly increase by well over 100,000 military

 personnel with the expansion of UNOSOM in Somalia and UNPROFOR forces in the former Yugoslavia and the full deployment of ONUMOZ in Mozambique. The cost in 1992 was almost US$3 billion. Peacekeeping operations have increased not just in number. The scope of peacekeeping operations has also expanded significantly, particularly in Cambodia and

 Somalia.

 We now have enough recent experience of peacekeeping, including test cases such as Namibia, Cambodia and Somalia, to make sensible choices about the future development of peacekeeping. But it is not before time for this debate to occur. The expansion and

 diversification of UN collective security operations, of which peacekeeping is just one part, has occurred largely without real debate or explicit consensus on the development of the UN's

 role, and the appropriate limits to it, either political or practical. Our intention in hosting this

 Seminar is to provide a forum for debate on these issues.

 Clearly the main focus of our analysis here should be an honest assessment of whether peacekeeping in its current format is working effectively, and what are the impediments to the immense task the international community has set itself for keeping and securing the peace. It will then be a matter of making recommendations for improving the peacekeeping operations

 themselves. Some of the more prominent issues we need to address here are how we can

 improve peacekeeping mandates and operations, whether a peacekeeping operation is always the most appropriate response to a particular security problem and how peacekeeping as a

 whole can be put on a more secure organisational and financial footing.

 But as we all know, peacekeeping does not operate in a political, strategic or institutional vacuum. We should also be taking this opportunity to contribute to the broader debate which is now under way on the standards, measures and responses which will enhance the ability of

 the international community to deal with the entire gamut of international security problems -and enable the specific task of peacekeeping to function better as a consequence.

 Is Peacekeeping working?

 Increased peacekeeping activity has imposed a much-increased burden on the UN. Today, the UN is seeking to respond to crises spread across several continents but without sufficient resources to do so effectively. While there have been some notable successes such as

 Namibia, El Salvador and, within recognised constraints, Cambodia, other operations - most recently UNOSOM I in Somalia - have been severely criticised as providing too little too late.

 The deployment of UNOSOM to Somalia was carried out without adequate forward planning.

 In its traditional self-defence role, UNOSOM was unable to deal effectively with heavily armed Somali factions. However UNITAF, a Chapter VII enforcement operation, has been able to achieve what UNOSOM originally could not, and it seems that the lessons from

 UNOSOM may have been learned. UNOSOM II is likely to have a mandate with teeth and

 with an integrated role including facilitating national reconciliation and rehabilitation.

 In Cambodia, the peace process, despite non-participation by the Khmer Rouge, is broadly on

 track, with the successful repatriation of over 330,000 refugees and the registration of more

 than 4.5 million voters for Constituent Assembly elections in May. UNTAC's task is daunting, but it is a mark of the very great distance we as UN members have travelled in the last two years that such an undertaking has become a reality. Certainly it is difficult to believe that UNTAC could have worked as well as it has without the long period of preparatory

 activity - both conceptual and operational - which preceded it.

 But for any future operations on such a scale, we need to address the problem of unwieldy and

 imprecise mandates, and the question of redefining those mandates as multi-dimensional and non-static situations evolve over time. We will also need to focus very closely on the effectiveness of the civilian components of peacekeeping operations, and the operational problems which tend to flow from centralisation of the command and management structures

 in New York.

 There have also been UN peacekeeping operations where the benefits have not been so

 obvious. In Cyprus the continuing presence of the peacekeeping force, while it may have been crucial in deterring further conflict, perhaps provides an easy excuse for the parties not to reach a political solution. In Mozambique, the UN operation's deployment has been delayed

 and there are signs the window of opportunity for a peaceful resolution may be closing. In Angola, the UN has been unfairly criticised by one of the parties for being ineffective in the face of the collapse of the peace process. In Bosnia-Herzegovina the deployment of a UN

 force has had all the appearance of both incomplete forward planning, and too little too late.

 4

 We need, in other words, to ask if the UN is trying to do too much and consider the extent to which the UN's own shortcomings contribute to the problems of making peacekeeping work.

 When is peacekeepingappropriate?

 It may be helpful for this Seminar to discuss the development of some flexible general

 principles or guidelines which would allow us to determine in which circumstances the international community should consider UN peacekeeping. When we reach the point of considering peacekeeping as an option, we need a framework to evaluate whether the benefits of deploying troops outweigh the costs, and whether the same expected outcome could be

 attained by other means.

 In responding to these questions it is important to appreciate the limits on the potential of

 peacekeeping operations. Such operations are unlikely to be able to resolve disputes just by being there. Deployment will only be appropriate, in most instances, where a political

 solution is already evident or within close reach. If there is no real prospect of a political solution, all peacekeepers can do is hold the line, perhaps indefinitely but at the risk of

 reducing the incentives for dialogue and peaceful resolution.

 We could also usefully consider some general guidelines for setting time limits to peacekeeping operations. The mandate for any peacekeeping operation needs to have a clear

 purpose and involve a clear, achievable goal for the operation. Once that goal, or benchmarks on the way to it, have been reached, decisions need to be taken about scaling down the forces

 and ultimately their withdrawal. Do we pull forces out if efforts at peacemaking consistently fail? Do we pull them out after some anticipated event such as elections? Or do we leave

 forces to oversee a "settling down" period? What if the goal is a successful election process but in the post—election period the unsuccessful party or parties do not accept the result, as in

 Angola? Some of these questions may soon be confronting us in Cambodia. We need to

 address these questions if the business of peacekeeping is to remain credible — and if we are to continue committing forces in such large numbers and in so many locations.

 How can we make peacekeeping operations work better?

 The Secretary General has raised many important issues in his "Agenda for Peace," which

 points the way towards an enhanced and better defined role for the UN in seeking to prevent

 or resolve serious conflicts and crises. The Secretary General's proposals on strengthening and

 J

 better managing peacekeeping operations will be addressed by Robert Grey and others during

 the Seminar. I want to mention only a few of the issues.

 The idea of a UN "standing army" or "rapid deployment force" is seriously hampered by the difficulty of predetermining a UN force structure when -- quite apart from the question of mandate - specific skills would be needed for each and every operation. But national earmarking or identification of forces would appear to be a practicable way of assisting the UN to improve planning. This carries no obligation to commit such forces without a case-by-case decision made on a national basis. In 1990, for example, Australia provided, in

 response to a UN questionnaire, a broad and detailed list of personnel and equipment that could, in principle, be made available for UN peacekeeping duties. We do not consider it necessary, however, to nominate specific units for peacekeeping duties, let alone place

 specific forces on standby: we believe that we can respond quickly and professionally to new situations as they arise without going this far.

 Recent experience has shown how funding, procurement and logistical shortcomings hamper the timely deployment of peacekeeping operations. Deployment requires prior agreement on precise arrangements for start-up funding and adequate prior planning, including coordination

 between procurement and logistics planning.  We need to explore how procurement

 procedures could be improved. Logistics planning needs to be part of preliminary planning

 and procedures standardised so that a logistics system is established on the ground at the same

 time as deployment. Considerable savings could be made if planning for new peacekeeping operations was undertaken in a more pro-active and detailed way, and if forces were deployed

 in a more orderly manner.

 At our national and regional levels, we can pursue increased peacekeeping operation

 effectiveness by improving military and police training in the principles and procedures for peacekeeping-type duties, and factoring such potential action into planning for bilateral and

 regional defence exercises and defence cooperation programs. We are establishing in

 Australia a peacekeeping centre to provide such training and would welcome regional

 participation.

 How are we to fund peacekeeping?

 The last thing we want to see resulting from the unprecedented increase in UN peacekeeping activities is less respect for the authority of the UN, which may follow if we stretch its limited capabilities and resources too far. But this is exactly what is likely to happen if there continue

 to be insufficient resources for planning and carrying out peacekeeping.

 In two years, the cost of peacekeeping has risen from US$400 million in 1991 to an estimated

 US$3 billion this year. The revised mandate for UNPROFOR could cost another US$2 billion per annum. It is essential that we overcome the difficulties and delays associated with inadequate financial arrangements for peacekeeping. The inadequacy arises in significant part from the failure of member states in the past to pay their contributions in full and on time.

 While alternative funding sources, such as voluntary contributions and contributions in kind, can supplement funding, assessed contributions remain the only sure method of funding UN

 peacekeeping operations.

 On the positive side, the General Assembly has established the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund and automatic approval of one-third of the anticipated budget for peacekeeping operations to

 enable speedy and effective deployment. The use of the Reserve Fund for ongoing peacekeeping operations must not, however, leave the Fund dry for the start-up costs for new

 peacekeeping operations such as ONUMOZ and UNOSOM II.

 Peacekeeping and the role of the international community  in securing peace in the post-Cold War era

 As I indicated at the outset, it is important that we don't consider peacekeeping operations in isolation. Peacekeeping - which in its most familiar form involves the monitoring,

 supervising and verifying of post-conflict agreements - is just one kind of response amongst many available for the international community in responding to threatened or actual breakdowns of international peace and security. Ideally, peacekeeping should not be one of the first steps taken by the international community, but rather one of the upper rungs on a ladder of proportionate responses to situations of security concern. There should be a more elaborate range of measures we should routinely pursue, especially in preventive diplomacy, before recourse to peacekeeping deployment becomes appropriate or necessary.

 The effectiveness of peacekeeping operations is very much a function of the overall

 effectiveness of a range of other aspects of collective security. And it is no secret that existing mechanisms at the international, regional and national levels are not coping effectively with post-Cold War challenges to security. The establishment of a true system of collective security will require a range of options for action in response to crises and a graduated

 response so that each action is necessary, proportionate and tailored to the various stages of disputes and conflicts.

 The immediate analytical need is to define the proper scope and limits of the international community's responsibility in responding to international security problems, and to identify and then recommend changes necessary to enable that responsibility to be more effectively

 exercised.

 This is, of course, a very ambitious and much larger undertaking, on which I and my Department have begun to do some detailed work but to which I cannot do justice in my address today. But let me at least touch just briefly on the question of where peacekeeping "fits in" among the wider range of collective security responses available to the international community. It seems to me that international responses to security problems, whatever their

 character or scale, can be sub—divided into three categories: prevention, assistance and

 intervention.

 "Preventive" strategies are those which are pursued before a dispute has crossed the threshold

 into armed conflict. They primarily take the form of preventive diplomacy — applying, in a

 pre—conflict context, the kinds of measures identified in Article 33 of the UN Charter — but might also involve preventive deployment, as most recently proposed in the Secretary General's "Agenda for Peace" (and as now operates in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia). Arms control and disarmament measures also fall into the preventive category.

 Preventive strategies are arguably the most underdeveloped, and yet potentially the most cost— effective, peacekeeping measures. Dr Wilenski will be addressing some aspects of the

 Secretary General's proposals on preventive diplomacy and Australian ideas in his paper to the

 Seminar.

 "Assistance" strategies are those which apply after armed conflict has occurred, and rely for their effectiveness on a significant measure of agreement by the country or parties concerned.

 They include what I call peacemaking diplomacy (involving essentially preventive diplomacy measures, but pursued in a post—conflict situation); peacemaking deployment (involving military deployment for defined, limited and agreed purposes, usually to restore a ceasefire);

 peacekeeping (which involves at its most straightforward level, as I have said, supervising, monitoring and verifying agreements, but which has come more recently — especially in

 Cambodia -- to involve many other functions as well, including electoral organisation and civil administration); and peacebuilding (involving the post—conflict development of

 conditions for a sustainable peace, including training and economic support).

 "Intervention" strategies differ conceptually from "assistance" ones in that they do not involve the prior agreement of the affected country or all parties, and operationally in that they may

 involve the use of large—scale force. The kinds of action entailed are essentially those set out
