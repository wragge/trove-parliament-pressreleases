 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT 0F PRESS CONFERENCE - INSTITUTE OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND ELECTRIC MATERIALS, WOLLONGONG, ‘THRIVING INDUSTRIES IN AN INNOVATIVE AUSTRALIA’ POLICY LAUNCH - SEPTEMBER 30TH 2002

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 Subjects: War Tax;  Iraq; Special Rules Conference; Party Reform; Cunningham By-election; National Infrastructure Council and Asylum Seekers.

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible).

 CREAN: I think with the announcement, of the deficit today, shows why the Government won’t rule out a tax, because it hasn’t got any other way to fund increasing commitment to the war effort. Let’s just go back a bit in terms of what it was saying at the last election; it said all of our then military commitment could be funded out of the existing Defence Budget. We know that the increased cost associated with Timor and the increased cost associated with border protection was a contributing factor to driving the Budget into deficit. Something the Government said before the last election wouldn’t happen. Now Labor has been consistent in saying that we want a diplomatic solution. We don’t want the war, it’s the Liberals that always keep talking the war rhetoric and we saw Joe Hockey doing it last week. I hope, I dearly hope that that which Labor has been advocating, the diplomatic solution for the United Nations by which Iraq complies with UN resolutions is the course we go down.

 What I find worrying is the fact that the Government is still talking the war rhetoric, not the peaceful solution and little wonder it’s talking the tax when the Treasurer knew of these figures before he left the country and has left it, as always, to the Finance Minister to announce the bad news. You’ll never see Peter Costello announcing the bad news, he’s alway claiming credit when it’s good news but he’s blaming someone else when it’s bad news. And now he’s going to shift the blame again in terms of the speculation about the tax. This is a Government, because it’s run down the surplus, it’s run it down with the underestimate of the cost of the GST to the economy, this is a Government

 that’s got only one solution for every problem it creates, and that is a new tax. We’ve seen it with the ‘Ticket Tax’ on Ansett, we’ve seen it with the ‘Milk Tax’ the Dairy Industry restructuring, they’re talking about a ‘Sugar Tax’ for Sugar Industry restructuring and now they’re talking, not just a ‘War Tax’ but also a ‘Tourism Tax’. This is a Government whose economic fundamentals, their credentials being exposed very rapidly.

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible).

 CREAN: We don’t support the circumstances of us going to war. We want diplomatic solution achieved. We want the Government to support that approach. We want the talk of war, the rhetoric of war to be replaced by in this use, for a diplomatic solution.

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible).

 CREAN: That’s a hypothetical question Dennis, and it’s something that the Prime Minister keeps avoiding making. What’s interesting is that his Treasurer and Defence Minister aren’t avoiding. They’re the ones that are anticipating not only the Government strategy in terms of a peaceful solution failing, but how we’re going to fund it. I’m not going to be drawn on the hypothetical. I want the peaceful solution and Labor is the only Party consistently since April that’s called for that. The Prime Minister has come round to it but only after he’s seen his misreading of the Australian public’s view at the war. He’s been driven by public opinion polls, we’ve been driven by what’s right for this nation. Making a decision as to what’s in the national interest and it’s in our national interest for the United Nations resolutions to be upheld and we’ve consistently called for that.

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible).

 CREAN: Well, it’s a test of many things Louise. And the issues that people are asking us about, quite frankly aren’t what’s happening in the Hawke Wran Review, they want to know what’s going to happen to Telstra? What’s going to happen to education? Why is it that they can’t find doctors that bulk bill and at the same time we’re finding that private health premiums are going up despite the fact that the Government said, it promised, to keep them down. They also want to know what’s in it by way of job security. These are the issues that the people are asking out there. These are the issues that are coming through Sharon. They are the issues next week, at the Special Rules Conference, are issues that have been raised in a number of quarters round here and I’m determined to address them. I’m determined to ensure that the branch stackers are not rewarded, I’m determined to have a set of rules that ensures that we continually put forward the best quality candidates available. And so to the extent to which those issues are of concern for some, they are issues that I’m prepared to address at the conference next week.

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible).

 CREAN: Because we have allowed debate to be opened up on the question of refugees, Bob. We have had policy forums all around the country to which every member for the Labor Party has been able to attend and express their views. We have also indicated that the fundamental task for Labor is to get a policy position that is tough on border protection but compassionate at the same time. And we’ve already signalled some important change, change to close Woomera, change to get the Australian Protective Services group, Government run organisation, back running the detention facilities. To get the kids out from behind the razor wire and make these facilities more open, more accountable. The issues that remain to be determined are the length of time that people are held in detention and the conditions under which they’re held. And these are issues that we are still progressing. They’re not matters for determination at the conference next weekend. That conference is being called specifically for the rules. But I’m determined to ensure that we get the right outcome in relation to refugees policy. It will involve consultation as it has to date and we will get the balance right. I’m determined to achieve that as well.

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible).

 CREAN: Well I, my partnership is with all groups within the community. That’s really why I’ve argued very strongly for the 50/50. But if we’re to invite other groups into the Party to participate to be part of the partnership, they’ve got to be treated as equals, not as minority parties. Now to the extent to which that push for reform causes concerns, I accept that’s part of the reform process, but it’s something I’m determined to achieve. If we’re to really reach out through a broader base, not ignore our past and not ignore our traditional base with the trade union movement but in fact to modernise it, to strengthen it, to make it more relevant, that’s what the reform process is about. But you know the issues that workers talk to me about are their job security, their future, the security of their entitlement, the ability to have greater flexibility between work and family and when you talk to people about those issues and say to them, this is what the Labor Party stands for, they appreciate that and remind you their supporters.

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible).

 CREAN: Look even Yvonne’s entitled to stand as a candidate. What strikes me strange is that there are thirteen candidates standing but not one of them is a Liberal, not one of them! Now John Howard said this would be a test for me. Well I’m prepared to sit a test and pass it, he won’t even sit it, because he’s taking the area for granted. This is the ultimate contest that any party can afford the electorate. “I’m not standing because you don’t deserve to have a choice about our policies”. Now I say to people, if you really are concerned about what John Howard is doing on Iraq, if you’re concerned about what he’s doing in terms of the further sale of Telstra, on the further Americanisation of our education system, of the running down of

 bulk billing, because he hasn’t given you a choice to vote for him, don’t vote for the independents, vote for Sharon Bird. Because John Howard, in not giving you a choice, will rally take comfort if those votes go against Labor. If people seriously want to send a message to the Liberal Party then they should vote for Sharon Bird, otherwise you’re just giving comfort and relaxation to a Prime Minister who is showing contempt for the Illawarra.

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible).

 CREAN: They did give us a message a couple of weeks ago, a message in terms of the Local Government election. It’s a message that I’ve heard. A message that I’m prepared to act on, a message of commitment that I’m now prepared to make, off the back of all of those commitments over many years that I’ve made for this region, but it’s a commitment I’m prepared to make, it’s not a commitment John Howard’s making. John Howard is treating the region with contempt.

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible).

 CREAN: I’m concerned to ensure that the Illawarra continues to get the best representation possible. My task is to demonstrate that that best representation is having Sharon Bird represent the seat. That’s what I’m concerned to demonstrate and that’s what I will continue to campaign on. I’m prepared to give people the candidate, prepared to give them the policies, prepared to give them the choice, John Howard won’t even enter the contest.

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible).

 CREAN: The question of national infrastructure is a very important issue, whether it’s the, whether it’s done by rail, road, other forms, telecommunications, information technology. We believe that this nation will only go ahead if we’re prepared to invest in our future, I’ve mentioned innovation today but one of the reasons why I’m committed to establishing the National Infrastructure Council is to address those important issues of infrastructure for the nation. The main icons are being built in this country, because governments have been prepared to invest in them. We’ve got to rethink that whole approach, we’ve got to have a national strategy for infrastructure. That I’m determined to achieve as well.

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible).

 CREAN: Well, you’ll see the policy announcements. We’ve already indicated the commitment to the National Infrastructure Council and quite frankly, we are going around the country, all of the time talking to regions about their infrastructure needs. And Craig’s Innovation Paper talks about ways in which some of the funding for these initiatives could be addressed. We will go to the next election with policies to support the building of the nation through the National Infrastructure Council.

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible).

 CREAN: I’m prepared to meet all sorts of people at all times (inaudible). I’ve indicated consistently that my commitment to this region is sound, but most importantly what people have to judge me about is the type of candidate that we’re putting forward to represent them. Someone who was born in the area, someone who’s lived in the area, someone who’s worked in the area, someone who knows the area. It’s that sort of person that’s needed in Canberra to represent the Illawarra. Now of course if people have concerns I’m prepared to meet with them to address them but I just say this to people, that the real test in this by-election is whether the issues that matter, not the personalities, not the internal differences, but the issues that matter to the Illawarra are given the opportunity to be expressed and the issues that matter are those that I’ve expressed before. That’s what the people of the Illawarra are talking about and that’s why the message, if they’re concerned about the direction the Government is going in, is to get behind Sharon Bird. Not give comfort to John Howard, not give relaxation to him. What he will take from support from independents, is not that his policies are wrong on Iraq, not that they’re wrong on Telstra, not that they’re wrong on education, he’ll take comfort from the fact that they’re right. And my argument is if these are the issues that matter to people, the most effective message that they can send to Canberra is to return Sharon Bird.

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible).

 CREAN: Well I don’t know the specific circumstances that the (inaudible). We have been saying to the Government for some months now that we’re prepared to work with them to get a lasting solution to the refugee issue. Historically it’s worked in this country when there’s been bipartisan support. And that’s what we’ve got to get back to. I believe the basis to the solution exists but it is very difficult when you’ve got the Government of the day still wanting to play politics with the solution rather than develop effective policy for it. Now we know that the Pacific Solution has been a costly failure. It’s not a policy solution, it’s not a Pacific Solution, it was a political solution. But let’s try and put that behind us and to work constructively for a lasting solution. I repeat the point, I am committed to achieving such a lasting solution. That’s why I have invested so much time in ensuring that the Party allows the debate internally to get the balance right between strength of border protection but compassion in the way you treat people who still arrive on our shores.

 ENDS.
