 Doorstop Interview

 Simon Crean - Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Shadow Treasurer

 Subjects: Petrol, Ansett, Asylum Seekers, Policy Costings, Aged Care

 Transcript - Oakleigh, Victoria - 3 November 2001

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 CREAN: Labor's policy on petrol is to keep the independents in the game. If the independents go out of the game the price of petrol will rise. What we need is genuine competition, and you will only get it if independents are kept in the game. That's why the list of measures that we have announced do that. They support the independents and they support them on the basis of consultation with them, and that's why the independents, as an organisation, will be supporting the Labor Party in this election.

 JOURNALIST: The Howard Government is continually saying that its policies on petrol prices are sufficient. What's your reaction?

 CREAN: It just shows out of touch they are. They are not sufficient. What needs to be done is to ensure that independents get the same access and same price at the terminal gate as the majors give to their retailers. That is not guaranteed at the moment. There needs to be greater transparency in the pricing, and we need to change the Trade Practices legislation to ensure that it is easier for the independents to take action when predatory pricing against them occurs, because the predatory pricing is designed to put them out of the game.

 JOURNALIST: Would you agree with the government's comments that some prices have gone down, some petrol prices?

 CREAN: Petrol prices have gone down for two reasons. One, we forced the government to honour its promise on the GST. It was collecting more GST than it should have been and we forced it to drop it and so therefore petrol prices came down as a result of that. Secondly, the pressure on world oil production eased over recent months. However, there are reports that restrictions on world production could come in

 again. What we therefore need to do is to continue to put in place policies that support competitive pressure to keep prices down. The government promised an inquiry - it still hasn't met. Labor promised an inquiry - it met and it delivered and our announcements on petrol pricing are a result of that inquiry.

 JOURNALIST: Lang Corporation is reportedly going to be another bidder for the failed Ansett airline. What's your reaction to this?

 CREAN: We welcome all serious bids that will get Ansett flying again. The real problem though is the government won't lift a finger to help get Ansett flying again. Yesterday in the court they were refusing to guarantee that the money raised by the ticket tax will be paid over for worker entitlements. Do you remember when the government said the reason it was imposing the ticket tax? To pay for worker entitlements. It now says it won't do it for that. The ticket tax is just another tax under John Howard. It's got nothing to do with getting Ansett flying again. Only Labor will support initiatives to get Ansett flying again.

 JOURNALIST: I know this is from left field, but do you agree with Laurie Brereton's comments that there needs to be an inquiry into the current arrangements for asylum seekers?

 CREAN: I've not seen those comments. Our commitment in terms of asylum seekers is a three-pronged one. We have got to close the gate through diplomatic relationships. We have already shown how the Howard Government can't even talk to Indonesia - we can. Second, there's got to be a cop on the beat, that's the Coastguard. And third, you've got to have in place a process if people get through the gate and if they get through the cop on the beat, that they are processed quickly and if they are not legitimate they are returned home. We had arrangements in 1994, arrangements with Indonesia and China to turn back 1,000 illegal asylum seekers at a very low cost. We did it because we had the arrangements in place.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean do you trust the government won't interfere with the process of your policy costings.

 CREAN: (laughs) I know what that Costello is up to. He's as tricky as a barrel load of monkeys this bloke. So that's we have sought, and got, an assurance, thankfully, from the Prime Minister, that we can be guaranteed that when we put costings in they won't be passed over to him, or to other sources. We have already had our policies costed by Access. We will comply with the Charter of Budget Honesty in submitting policies to Treasury and Finance. What's very interesting today, is that there's a report in one newspaper that says, that despite John Howard and Peter Costello saying that all their costings have gone in, this report says up to a third of their policies haven't been submitted. This is Peter Costello being tricky and dishonest again it would seem.

 JOURNALIST: When are you going to put Labor's costings in?

 CREAN: We'll be submitting our policies in accordance with the Charter of Budget Honesty. Now that we've got that assurance, those policies will go in.

 JOURNALIST: (inaudible)

 CREAN: They will be going in from now.

 Can I just say this about nursing homes. Today we've got a leaked report from the department that shows, that there is a huge gap in the number of nursing home beds available. It's exposed the government lie. The government said there was no problem with nursing home beds - their own report shows that there

 is. What has also happened today is that one of the Liberal Party's true believers has turned against them on nursing homes. A big operator in nursing home beds, Doug Moran, has said he's going to withdraw his support for the Liberal Party over their bungling of aged care. He's got no confidence in Bronwyn Bishop, none in the government, and he's supporting Labor's policy on aged care beds. Labor now has support for its aged care policy across the political spectrum. It's been endorsed now by providers of aged care facilities, including Mr Doug Moran, a long time supporter of the Liberal Party. He knows their policy is bad and he knows Labor has got the policy to fix aged care in this country.
