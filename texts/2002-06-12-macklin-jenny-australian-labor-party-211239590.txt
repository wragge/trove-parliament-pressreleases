 WE’RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER

 SPEECH TO THE

 SYDNEY INSTITUTE

 BY

 JENNY MACKLIN

 DEPUTY LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION, SHADOW MINISTER FOR

 EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION, TRAINING AND SCIENCE

 12 JUNE 2002

 Last Thursday I flew home from Canberra in time to see my youngest child perform

 in his school concert.  He plays the saxophone in the school band. Like school bands

 everywhere the young musicians were a colourful and very different bunch. Different

 backgrounds and different cultures - the inspirational product of a nation where one in

 four of our citizens are migrants and one in five are the children of migrants.

 As I sat in this public school hall and listened, I saw that my son was learning much

 more than how to play the saxophone. He was learning one of the most important

 lessons in life - to get on with people and to make allowances for the differences.

 He and the rest of the band were musical proof of that timeless Australian value:

 “we’re all in it together.”   In the case of the school band “all being in it together”

 guaranteed a harmonious outcome. It also acknowledged the value of difference.

 It’s no different when it comes to harnessing energy and endeavour across a nation.

 When all Australians are convinced that  “we’re all in it together”, all Australians

 will benefit.

 John Howard and his Government think otherwise. They’ve created a Great Divide in

 the Australian social landscape that’s as forbidding as any mountain range. At every

 2

 level the central message from this Government is that “it’s everyone for

 themselves.”

 John Howard pits us against one another in the name of competition, individualism

 and choice. In many ways, the development of “gated communities” where fences and

 security systems quarantine residents from the outside world are symptomatic of what

 is happening under John Howard.

 Those who can afford it purchase safety and security just as they purchase education

 and health care. The disturbing aspects of life can be relegated to the other side of the

 fence.

 John Howard wants a “gated Australia” - an inward looking, insular nation intent on

 building barriers rather than bridges to the outside world.

 In the past few days, the Howard Government has once again shown that it is not a

 Government that will build on our national strengths - rather it will play to our fears

 by redrawing the map of Australia for immigration purposes to bring our borders

 closer in.

 Superficially, this would appear to be confined to immigration policy but in my view

 they have critical social implications.

 It’s a further example of Government policies that diminish Australia and Australians.

 In a late announcement last Friday, the Howard Government excised all islands off

 Australia’s northern mainland from the nation’s migration zone.

 Then on Sunday - claims from President Rene Harris of Nauru that the so-called

 Pacific Solution is nothing more than a Pacific Nightmare.

 According to the President of the tiny Pacific Island state, John Howard has failed to

 keep his side of the bargain in the election-driven deal to offload more than 1100

 3

 asylum seekers on Nauru.  Despite the deadline of the 30th May passing about 700

 asylum seekers remain on Nauru.

 Rather than propping up the illusion of a long term “Pacific Solution” by further

 excisions and other stop-gap measures, the Government should start work on a

 comprehensive long term plan to deal with refugee and asylum seeker issues, not knee

 jerk policies based on exploitation of poor countries.

 This is the task the Australian Labor Party has embarked upon.  We have made it

 plain that we believe we can put forward compassionate policies while protecting our

 borders.  Our policy review has published a framework for discussion of asylum

 seekers issues and some of our policy changes have already been announced.

 Labor has called for the release of all children from detention centres.

 In addition under our policy:

 â¢ The government would take back control of the detention centres; and

 â¢ Woomera would be mothballed.

 And the great divide doesn’t stop with asylum seekers, it also resonates through the

 Howard Government’s health policies.

 A Government that believed all Australians were in it together would not have short-changed our public hospitals while simultaneously blackmailing and cajoling millions

 of Australians into private health insurance.

 The Government’s policy rewards self-interest rather than the value of working

 together to strengthen public hospitals and Medicare.

 The differences in policy approaches are clear.  One side says that if you can pay, you

 deserve to jump the queue to get preferred treatment.  The other says, when it comes

 to health care, it shouldn’t matter who you are or how much you can pay.

 4

 The Howard Government is not so blunt as to say - there is no such thing as society -

 the famous Margaret Thatcher quote - but look at the policies - $2 billion on private

 health insurance subsidies and $3 billion extra for private schools. Their policies

 speak for themselves.

 But it is in the area of education that the greatest damage can be done to our sense of

 togetherness, because it is our education system that strengthens and invigorates

 Australia’s values.

 Rather than strengthening our capacities to work together, the Federal Government’s

 neglect of public education is laying down the foundations for greater divisions.

 Further proof of the Great Divide.

 Our public education system is our greatest defense against concentrated disadvantage

 and entrenched prejudice.  Sharing a public education, Australians from different

 backgrounds and beliefs come together, learn together, have fun together and develop

 a sense of shared social good.

 Australia must fiercely oppose attacks on our public education system.  Arguments,

 such as those put forward by the Liberal Party Treasurer, Malcolm Turnbull, calling

 for public schools funding to be diverted to private schools would lead to the

 disintegration of our society into disparate communities of interest.

 It’s a trap for different groups and communities; a device to divide them rather than to

 encourage people to work together for a cohesive society.

 Under the ideological mantra of giving people choice, John Howard is taking

 Australia down a narrow and isolationist path.

 Labor takes a different approach.  We believe at our core that we are in it

 together that we must strive for a common purpose.

 Since becoming Deputy Leader I have met many people who are passionate

 about education. Among them, representatives of Catholic, Jewish, Muslim

 5

 and Christian schools who are only too aware of the divisions that are

 emerging. And they are worried.

 One educator from a private religious school was strongly opposed to the concerted

 devaluing of our public education system. He told me that ‘public schools are the

 backbone of this country’. This is a view shared by most Australians, who are looking

 to government for constructive policies in support of public education.

 Instead, we now have a Commonwealth Government that has chosen to exacerbate the

 problem, not to reduce or resolve it.  It has exacerbated the problem by its neglect of

 public schools.

 The Budget gives nothing new to public schools except annual adjustments to cover

 cost increases.  By contrast, the Budget papers show that the Government is

 conservatively estimating that Commonwealth funding of non-government schools

 will exceed $5 billion by 2005-06.

 This means that Commonwealth funding of non-government schools, since 1996, will

 have increased by over $3 billion. That’s an increase of almost 170 per cent.

 Australian egalitarianism - our commitment to a fair go - should question

 Government policy that puts billions of additional dollars towards private schools

 while effectively giving public schools a zero increase in constant prices.

 It is not a policy approach that embraces all Australians - especially the 2.2 million

 children and young people enrolled at public schools.

 POLICY REVIEW PROCESS

 Labor is currently developing new policies that build on, rather than erode,

 Australians’ sense of fairness.

 The policy review process is about responding to the complex and varied needs of a

 changing society.

 6

 Our approach in the past has been very much a one size fits all model, forcing square

 pegs into round holes.

 What’s overwhelmingly obvious now is that people are demanding options. Their

 situations, needs and ambitions vary. Families are different; work habits are different.

 We must have policies that reflect these changes.

 The following analysis by Hugh Mackay is illuminating:

 He says:

 “Thirty-year-olds typical approach to work can be summed up in one word: flexibility.

 By adopting a flexible approach to the kind of work done, to the number of hours

 worked, and to one’s preparedness to switch jobs, people in this age-group have

 mastered the art of living with job insecurity.  Now they come to regard flexibility in

 employment as a positive virtue.”

 Young people, particularly, are saying to me that they want to keep their options open.

 What they want from government is support to develop their own solutions rather than

 to sign up to a set plan.

 So the challenge in my portfolio area of education is make sure all Australians have a

 strong general education, from which they can break out and learn new knowledge

 and skills, as they need to.

 We also have to create a life long learning system that lives up to this challenge - that

 gives people the opportunities to mix and match.

 More and more I’m hearing that younger Australians are comfortable with constant

 change. That means rigid policies have little relevance to their lives.

 These people know that they will need to and want to switch jobs, over the course of

 their life.  Our job is to give them the capacity to do this and to do it quickly.

 7

 It requires a sea change in policy and attitude.  We need to find new ways to offer

 access to entitlements that enable people to keep their options open.

 Labor can do this without losing its traditional values.

 Values that begin with an abhorrence of inequality and a determination to improve the

 standard of living for low and middle income Australians. Values that recognise the

 responsibility of governments to use public institutions to strengthen society.

 These are the traditional tasks for any Labor Government but finding new and modern

 ways to deliver these improvements is essential.

 Measures such as Simon Crean’s commitment to exploring the benefits of tax credits

 for low income Australian families.

 His guarantee that every last cent of a worker’s entitlements will be covered through

 an insurance scheme that will cost large companies only 0.1 per cent of payroll

 reflects our commitments to deliver to these Australians.

 These policies reflect our understanding that more and more Australians are working

 in low paid, insecure jobs.  This reality requires new policy approaches like tax credits

 for working families.

 Federal Labor’s policies will recognise families working arrangements - they will

 complement the realities of people’s lives.

 With two incomes a necessity for most Australian families, it is Labor’s view that it’s

 time Australia caught up with the rest of the world and introduced paid maternity

 leave.

 But we know it doesn’t stop there.  What parents need are real options and solutions

 for the first five years of their child’s life.  A five-year solution that gives them five

 years of reassurance and certainty in what is inevitably an unpredictable time.

 8

 Family-work-options will require significant changes in policy and attitude. To

 become family-work-friendly we need to develop more responsive models of parental

 leave and income support and improve access to high quality, affordable childcare.

 Options like longer unpaid leave with guaranteed job security, part-time work,

 working from home, job sharing should also be thrown into the mix.

 Again, it’s about recognising the value of difference while working to develop

 policies that advance the common good. It’s about giving people greater control over

 their lives and their local communities.

 The need to target our policies to communities; to go “local” is a common theme in

 Labor’s policy review.

 People are turning local because that’s one place where they think they can make a

 difference. Although they’re turning off politics (and politicians) in droves, people

 still believe in their local communities.

 They connect through playgroups, book clubs, sporting clubs, school canteens, and

 voluntary organisations.

 The challenge then, for the Labor Party, is to convince them that, just as they make

 the wheels go round in their local schools and community groups, they can and should

 be an essential part of politics at every level.

 Simon Crean’s push to modernise the Labor Party is about acknowledging that the

 way people work and live their lives has changed and that a modern political party

 must open itself more to community based groups, while still maintaining its

 traditional connection with the labour movement.

 By responding to the real problems that face many communities - crime, urban decay,

 poor school results - with policies like community safety zones, education priority

 zones and urban renewal, local communities will regain greater control.

 9

 The policy review is as much about engagement and reaching out to communities

 hearing from them about what matters to their lives. We will continue to do this

 throughout 2002 and submissions are welcome until 1st December.  In addition to

 taking written submissions, Shadow Ministers are holding policy forums around the

 country to discuss with people the issues that most concern them.

 The review process provides Labor with the opportunity to develop a deeper

 appreciation of the enormous changes that confront Australians - the gender

 revolution, the revolution in information and knowledge, the internationalisation of

 our economy, the increasing polarization of work - to name just a few.

 To explain these changes and to make sense of them in a way that reinforces not

 undermines the Australian way of life is critical to our task.

 Balancing the books will never be enough for Labor.  It is our job to inspire people to

 believe that there is a better and fairer way to organise our economy and our society.

 Labor will always be committed to a strong economy - it is the basis of a prosperous

 and fair society.  But like most Australians we believe government must do a lot more

 than manage the economy.

 The society we confront now is a very different one from the 1980s and early 1990s

 when Labor was last in Federal Government. Our policy solutions must therefore

 reflect and respond to these changes while staying true to our values - that is the

 challenge of the policy review.
