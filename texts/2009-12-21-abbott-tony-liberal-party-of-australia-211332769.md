 ABBOTT DOORSTOP - PAID MATERNITY LEAVE, KEVIN RUDD'S FAILED  BORDER PROTECTION POLICIES, KEVIN RUDD NEEDS TO COME OUT OF  HIDING, KATE LUNDY, EDUCATION 

 The Hon Tony Abbott MP  

 Leader of the Opposition 

 E&OE  

 QUESTION:  

 You have made some comments about maternity leave there. What exactly do you have in mind in terms of 

 changes?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Look, I am seeking advice and I am not going to go into the detail other than to say that the Government’s 

 scheme is a Mickey Mouse scheme and we’ll try to do better.  

 QUESTION:  

 Why is it a Mickey Mouse scheme, what’s wrong with it?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Because it doesn’t actually give some women more than they would already get.  

 QUESTION:  

 So is this something that just occurred to you while you were speaking to the women here?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 No. No, you go and read Battlelines and you’ll see that it’s something that’s been on my mind for some time.  

 QUESTION:  

 Can you give us an idea of what you would like to see changed?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 No, I am seeking advice. That’s what I’m seeking.  

 QUESTION:  

 ... refugee policy starting to unravel?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Oh look, every day another boat seems to arrive. Plainly Christmas Island is full to bursting. What they said was a 

 white elephant is now too small because Mr Rudd’s policy has started the boats coming. Here in the West it’s 

 very obvious that Mr Rudd’s policy has failed and I see that the first of the Sri Lankans who were on the Oceanic 

 Viking are now in Australia, which shows that Mr Rudd was effectively blackmailed into giving people what they 

 wanted and that’s the last thing that an Australian government should be - vulnerable to blackmail.  

 QUESTION:  

 They are also going to Canada and the US and other countries. Aren’t they allowed to come to Australia?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 The fact is that they held that ship for about a month. Effectively, they held that ship and that shouldn’t have 

 happened.  

 QUESTION:  

 It seems that the refugees have a very good strike rate of getting to Australia after being assessed by 

 immigration. Are the benchmarks too low do you think? Should they be reassessing the evaluation?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 It’s important to have control of our borders. The mark of a sovereign nation is that we have control of our 

 borders, and one of the problems with Mr Rudd is that I think he is too ready to give away Australia’s sovereignty. 

 We saw evidence of that in Copenhagen and certainly his border protection policy is not the policy that we should 

 have as a strong and sovereign nation.  

 QUESTION:  

 Can I ask you one on behalf of my colleagues in Sydney, there is apparently a re-emergence of ‘Merry 

 Christmas’ signs rather than ‘Seasons Greetings’ signs, which were more politically correct apparently. Do you 

 welcome that return?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Look I am happy to see people celebrating this Christmas season.  

 QUESTION:  

 Do you think ‘Merry Christmas’ is acceptable or unacceptable?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Look I am a fierce critic of political correctness and if people feel that they can celebrate the Christmas season in 

 their own way, that’s great.  

 QUESTION:  

 Alannah MacTiernan you described as a reject?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Well she wanted to be the leader of the state parliamentary Labor Party. They didn’t want her. They have now put 

 her in to contesting the federal seat of Canning. Now, if she wasn’t good enough for the state party why should 

 she be good enough for the Federal Parliament?  

 QUESTION:  

 Isn’t Don Randall a bit of a reject? He sort of moved from Swan to Canning because he lost Swan?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Well Don is a fiercely competitive, powerful local member - there is no one who represents their seat more 

 effectively in the Federal Parliament than Don Randall.  

 QUESTION:  

 Who like you has been a bit of a maverick over the years; come out with some statements that have caused 

 angst for the Party.  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Look, Don, he is a character and we need more characters in the Parliament.  

 QUESTION:  

 Have you sorted out your travel problem that you had?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 There was no problem. The interesting point that I really should make is that Mr Rudd has come back from 

 Copenhagen. He went to Copenhagen with more than 100 advisers. Having come back from Copenhagen, 

 instead of explaining the outcome to the Australian people he is in hiding in Kirribilli House. Now I say to Mr 

 Rudd, do the right thing by the Australian people, come out of hiding. Don’t closet yourself in Kirribilli House. 

 Don’t send out Penny Wong and Kate Lundy and all these other minions to explain the disappointing outcome of 

 Copenhagen. Do it yourself. You were the one who built Copenhagen up. You were the one who was a friend of 

 the chair. You were the one who was the co-author of the rejected documents. You need to explain yourself.  

 QUESTION:  

 Just on climate change. Would you support more ambitious reduction targets if the Government commits to 

 those?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 No, I support the emission reduction targets that are Coalition policy.  

 QUESTION:  

 So any further commitment to further reductions would not be supported?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Look, I think it’s for Mr Rudd to explain himself. He has to come out of hiding in Kirribilli House. It is his policy 

 which has failed. It’s his rush to legislate before Copenhagen which is now exposed as completely unnecessary. 

 He is the one who has to explain himself.  

 QUESTION:  

 There is an investigation into your travel. Are you worried you might have to pay it back?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 No.  

 QUESTION:  

 …your comments on the Bible studies, the Bible reading?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Well, look the only person who tries to inflict his religious views on the Australian public is Mr Rudd and one of his 

 own Labor Members of Parliament has admitted that today. Mr Rudd’s office sent Senator Lundy out to attack me 

 and instead she has left Mr Rudd in the lurch.  

 QUESTION:  

 … that you want the Bible into the national curriculum?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 False. Patently false.  

 QUESTION:  

 What did you mean to say? Or what did you say?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Read what I said.  

 Thanks so much.
