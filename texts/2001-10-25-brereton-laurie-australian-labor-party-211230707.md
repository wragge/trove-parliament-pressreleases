 FIJI: NEW ZEALAND CONTINUES SANCTIONS, AUSTRALIA OFFERS INDUCEMENTS

 The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laurie Brereton, today welcomed the New Zealand Government’s  announcement  that  it  will  not  lift  sanctions  on  Fiji  until  the  issue  of  the constitutionality of the current Fijian Cabinet is resolved.

 “New Zealand’s decision to defer lifting Fiji sanctions is appropriate”, Mr Brereton said.  “The Commonwealth  has  also  deferred  consideration  of  Fiji’s  suspension  from  Commonwealth meetings until the Fiji Court of Appeal brings down a decision.”

 “Wellington’s consistent stance is in sharp contrast to the Howard Government’s premature and expedient decision of 5 October to lift Australian sanctions on Fiji.”

 “John  Howard’s  decision,  announced  just  a  few  hours  before  the  calling  of  Australia’s election, was cynically designed to facilitate negotiations with Fiji to become another Pacific camp for Afghan and Iraqi asylum seekers.”

 “The Howard Government is now offering further inducements to Fiji and other Pacific Island countries.   They  are  doing  so  in  violation  of  the  spirit  of  Australia’s  election  campaign caretaker conventions.”

 “The Fiji Government of Prime Minister Lasenia Qarase yesterday established a high-level task force to examine the Howard Government’s proposal to use Fiji as a processing centre for asylum seekers.”

 “Significantly, an Australian Government Delegation in Suva yesterday issued a statement saying  that:   ‘Australia  is  willing  to  provide  Pacific  states  additional  bilateral  development assistance in appreciation of  their support [for accepting processing centres] and to assist them to manage the additional burden’.”

 “Labor was not advised of or consulted about this statement by an Australian delegation to an  international  conference  in  Suva.   It  is  improper  in  the  caretaker  period  for  Australian officials to make undefined offers of inducements to foreign countries to support the Howard Government’s policies.  This is a gross breach of the spirit of the caretaker conventions.”

 “Australian  taxpayers  have  already had  to  fork  out  $100  million  to  pay for  John  Howard’s policy  failure  on  illegal  immigration.   Who  knows  how  many  more  taxpayer  dollars  they propose to spend?”

 “In  respect  of  Fiji,  a  Beazley  Labor  Government  will  give  strong  support  for  an  inclusive political  settlement  consistent  with  Fiji’s  constitution  and  the  rule  of  law.   We  will  consult closely with New Zealand and the Commonwealth to ensure that a consistent approach is taken on sanctions.   Only when  we  are  satisfied  that  proper constitutional procedures are being followed, will Labor fully normalise Australia’s bilateral relationship with Fiji.”

 Copies  of  the  New  Zealand  Government’s  sanctions  announcement  today  and  the Australian Delegation statement made in Suva yesterday are attached.

  Lifting of Fiji sanctions 

  deferred pending resolution of   constitutional issue 

  Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Phil Goff said today that   New Zealand would defer lifting sanctions against Fiji until   the issue of the constitutionality of the current Cabinet was 

  resolved. ‘This matter is due to go before the Fiji Court of 

  Appeal in February 2002. 

  “‘The Commonwealth has also deferred consideration of Fiji’s   suspension from the Councils8 of the Commonwealth until the   Court of Appeal’s decision. 

  “The Commonwealth clearly believes that an important   constitutional issue remains Iunresolved 

  with the legal 

  Ichallenge to the exclusion of the Fiji Labour Party from the 

  ‘Cabinet which appears to be contrary to s.99(5) of the Fiji 

  constitution. New Zealand wishes to act collectively with the   Commonwealth. 

  “New Zealand accepts and welcomes the restoration of   democracy in Fiji. It also accepts that Prime Minister Qarase   who has .the confidence of the majority of Parliament is 

  properly Prime Minister of Fi.ji. However the constitutionality   of his Cabinet remains in question. This w’as confirmed by 

  Fiji’s own Chief Justice, Sir Timoci Tuivaga. 

  “I have spok.en with Fiji Foreign Minister Kaliopate Tavola to 

  explain New Zealand’s position. 

  “I told Mr Tavola that New Zealand was keen to see Fiji 

  return to full participation in the activities of the 

  Commoniwealth so targeted sanctions could be lifted and   relations nolrmalised. 

  “As soon as the Court has determined the question of 

  constitut:ionality and its requirements are acted upon by the   parties the way will be clear for New Zealand and the 

  Commonwealth to resume normal and friendly relations with   Fiji,” Mr Goff said.
