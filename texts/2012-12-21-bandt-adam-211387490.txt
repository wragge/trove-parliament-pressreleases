 Swan should now undo damage and reverse  Budget cuts: Bandt    

 Acting Australian Greens Leader, Adam Bandt, has written today to the Acting Prime Minister,  Wayne Swan, calling on the government to reverse the harmful Budget cuts that have been made in  the name of achieving the now abandoned surplus timeline.    

 Mr Bandt says cuts to the single parents payment and university research and the redirection of  foreign aid to asylum seeker programs should be reversed.    

 In the letter, Mr Bandt commits the Australian Greens to working with the government on stimulus  programs in the next Budget, including boosting Newstart by $50 per week, further moves to put  dental into Medicare and building high speed rail. 

 

 “The Greens have consistently argued not just that there is a looming revenue crisis, but also that  spending cuts would hurt people, small business and the economy more broadly,” Mr Bandt said.    

 "I am pleased the Government has seen sense, agreed with the Greens and ditched the arbitrary  surplus timeline."    

 “The government should now take the opportunity to repair the damage to the last Budget caused  by their political surplus promise.”    

 “The Treasurer should reverse the decision to push 150,000 single parents off the parenting  payment on January 1 and reverse the cuts to uni research and overseas aid.”    

 “We are ready to work with the government on boosting Newstart, getting more dental care into  Medicare and building high speed rail.”    

 “These measures would help stimulate a weakening economy, especially in south-eastern Australia,  which is suffering from the pressures of the mining boom and an uncertain international outlook.”

  Dear Acting Prime Minister,

  As you are aware, for some time the Greens have been calling for the Government to abandon its commitment to reach a surplus in 2O72/t3.

  I am pleased that the Government is no longer aiming for this timeline.

  The Greens have consistently argued not just that there is a looming revenue crisis, but also that spending cuts would hurt people, small business and the economy more broadly. Unfortunately, a number of harmful cuts have recently been made in the name of achieving the now abandoned surplus timeline.

  Given the Government's changed approach, I ask you to consider reversing these cuts.

  In particular, the Greens urge you to consider:

  1. The cuts to single parent payment arrangements due to come into effect from L Jan 20L3, which have seen the Parenting Payment cancelled for many single parents solely to achieve a 5685.8m saving over the forward estimates;

  2. The cuts to the Sustainable Research Excellence program of $499m; and

  3. The recent decision to divert the foreign aid budget to be spent on domestic programs relating to asylum seekers and refugees.

  The Greens also look forward to working with the Government in the lead-up to the next Budget to raise additional revenue and to fund several measures, including a SSO/wk increase to Newstart, the commencement of east coast High Speed Rail and moving dental care into Medicare. These measures would help stimulate a weakening economy, especially in south-eastern Australia, which is suffering from the pressures of the mining boom and an uncertain international outlook.

  Yours faithfully,
