 Vanstone All at Sea on the Minasa Bone   

 Minister Vanstone must immediately address the unanswered questions on  her actions since the arrival of the unauthorised vessel, the Minasa Bone.   

 The Minister has backtracked on her version of the facts about the Minasa  Bone, which remind everyone of the Government’s cynical manipulation of  the truth in the children overboard affair.     

 10 days after the Minasa Bone arrived at Melville Island, the Minister still  cannot tell us with any certainty what triggered the Government move to  excise more than 4,000 islands.  Her certainty that they were asylum seekers  swung her into immediate action, but she now has another version of events.   

 All that is now clear is that the new Minister decided to excise first, and ask  questions later.     

 For a government that claims to be tough on people smugglers, it is also  alarming that Minister Vanstone can’t tell us whether the alleged people  smugglers in this affair have been charged, or handed a “get out of jail free”  card.      

 Her mismanagement of this issue now appears to have offended Indonesian  authorities, whose cooperation is essential to an effective long-term response  to people smuggling.   

 Her advice to colleagues, including the Prime Minister and the Foreign Affairs  Minister, now appears to be incorrect and has gone uncorrected by Minister  Vanstone for more than a week.  Alexander Downer is not happy.   

 Labor believes that we can be tough on border protection without  breaching the rule of law, or excising thousands of islands.  Our policy makes  this clear, and presents a much better alternative to Vanstone’s policy on the  run.
