 MEDIA RELEASE

 Temporary visas spell danger for refugees  on Manus   

 The failure of permanent resettlement deals in Papua New Guinea and Nauru will have  disastrous, long-term effects on the people who have bene dumped there, the Australian  Greens have said.   

 “The resettlement deal on Manus has fallen apart, just like on Nauru, and it’s the refugees who  are going to suffer,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Refugees on Manus were attacked and killed inside the centre this year. They’ll be even more  vulnerable when they’re on the outside.   

 “Being dumped in a hostile community on a temporary visa is a recipe for disaster.   

 “Australia can care for the people on Manus and Nauru. We should be offering them refuge  while expanding refugee processing in the region and increasing resettlement in Australia.”
