 AUSTRALIA'S PLACE IN THE WORLD

 by

 SENATOR GARETH EVANS  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS & TRADE

 Address by the Minister for Foreign Affairs & Trade,  Senator Gareth Evans, to ANU Strategic and Defence Studies  Centre Bicentennial Conference, Australia and the World:  Prologue and Prospects.  Canberra 6 December 1988

 AUSTRALIA'S PLACE IN THE WORLD

 A geographically remote country of sixteen and a half  million people in a world of over five billion should not  get ideas above its station. But although Australia's  population size, military power, political authority and  economic importance may all be modest in world terms, we do  have a profile, as a diplomatically active trading nation,  that commands some attention: not only with our 

 traditional friends and trading partners, not only in our  own region, but multi later ally and, in the context of our  defence contribution to the Western Alliance, globally as  well.

 While we have to take the world more or less as we find it,  and cannot do much about our own defining characteristics,  Australia's place in the world is in many ways what we want  it to be. How much attention we get in our bilateral and  multilateral relationships,  and whether that attention is 

 favourable or unfavourable, productive or counter­ productive, depends to a significant extent on how we  choose to conduct our external relations.  Even if we have  no alternative but to play the cards with which we are  dealt, we still have choices about how to deploy those 

 cards.

 For most of Australia's history, those nowadays perhaps  rather self-evident assertions would not have seemed so at  all. For its first century and a half, Australia viewed  the world vicariously as a daughter of Empire.  A handful  of matters aside, the national interest was more or less 

 indistinguishable from the imperial interest,  and choices  effectively non-existent:  "Great Britain has declared war  ... and as a result Australia is also at war".

 Nor did the situation change dramatically even with the  post-War switch of focus to the United States, and Evatt's  creation of a genuine External Affairs Department.  With  only slight exaggeration, one could say that the task of  Australian foreign policy was to do the job that successive  Australian Governments had decided could not be done by  defence policy - namely, ensuring the defence of 

 Australia.  A continent that was indefensible reguired a  foreign policy that secured the attention of great and  powerful friends who were prepared to defend Australia.   The attention of great and powerful friends could best be 

 secured by offering Australia's support in the great  matters in which those friends were weightily engaged. So  Australian foreign policy necessarily became driven by the  commitment of Australian military forces around the world, 

 in support, first, of British imperial interests and later 

 of American global strategy.

 Most of this came to an end with the Vietnam War, and with  the giant strides that were taken in the creation of a  thoughtful, realistic, non-subservient and genuinely  Australian foreign policy by the Whitlam Government in 

 1972. But I think in many ways the real conceptual 

 watershed occurred only as recently as March 1987, with the  tabling of Kim Beazley's Defence White Paper,  based in turn  on Paul Dibb’s defence review a year earlier.

 The White Paper, supported by subsequent Budget decisions,  spelt out a coherent policy of defence self-reliance, or  defence in depth, based upon strategies of early detection,  long range sea and air strike capability, highly mobile  ground forces,  and the joint operation of communications 

 and intelligence facilities with the United States. And it  did so in a way which enabled the simultaneous achievement, 

 or advancement, of four fundamental objectives: 

 independent defence of Australian territory; promotion of 

 regional security and stability; capacity to meet alliance  obligations; and contribution to global strategic security.

 3

 â¦ .

 I see the White Paper as a watershed not only in defence  policy, but in foreign policy. In a very real sense, the  Hawke Government’s defence policy has once arid for all  liberated Australian foreign policy. Our alliance with the  United States remains a fundamental pillar of our defence 

 and foreign policy. But it is no longer necessary for  Australian foreign policy to begin with the assumption that  its first task is to ensure the defence of Australia by  attracting the protective attention of great and powerful 

 friends.

 As a result an Australian Foreign Minister is now freer to  think about his responsibilities a little more 

 systematically, and, may I say, a little more intricately,  than has ever previously been the case. It is possible now  to contemplate an approach to foreign policy decision­ making which involves, not the writing of manuals on how to 

 get one's foot in the door of a protector's office, but  rather the case by case weighing and balancing of national  interests, and opportunities for influence, across an  extraordinarily complex and variegated field. In short, 

 the evolution in our defence and strategic thinking has put  into sharp relief the reality that Australia's interests 

 are multidimensional, and that to promote these interests  we need policies that are equally multidimerisional.  And it  has made clearer the kinds of choices that are available in  the process.

 The starting point, in the approach that I have in mind,  is  necessarily the concept of national interest.  It is of  course a truism that all foreign policy is, or should be,  directed at the protection and advancement of the national 

 interest. But the different elements that make up the  national interest,  and our capacity to advance it, are not  necessarily self-evident at all:  they require definition,  elaboration and thinking through.

 I think it is helpful to group our interests in three broad  categories: geo-political or strategic interests; economic  and trade interests; and the national interest in being,  and being seen to be, a good international citizen - or, to  put this another way, our interest in pursuing what Hedley  Bull used to call "purposes beyond ourselves".  The scope  of the first two categories is fairly obvious, the third 

 maybe less so.

 Our overriding geo-political or strategic interest is the  defence of Australian sovereignty and political 

 independence. That has both a regional and a global  dimension. As to the first, we do have a direct interest  in ensuring that the countries around us remain peaceful  and stable and well-disposed, or at least neutrally-  disposed, toward us. The regions of primary foreign policy 

 interest are essentially identical to those identified in  the Defence White Paper as, respectively, the "zone of  direct military interest" (which includes Australia's  territories and proximate ocean areas,  Indonesia, Papua New  Guinea, New Zealand and other nearby countries of the South  West Pacific) and the "area of primary strategic interest" 

 (covering the eastern Indian Ocean, and the rest of South  East Asia and the South West Pacific). In other words,  

 regional foreign policy considerations are well mapped on 

 the same concentric-ringed chart that appeared in the Dibb  Review and the Beazley White Paper.  I hardly need to add  that it was not merely fortuitous that my first major  overseas visits as Foreign Minister, made just after I was  sworn in, were to the South Pacific and South East Asia 

 respectively.

 Our other major geo-political interest,  which we in fact  share with everyone else,  is the avoidance of global  nuclear war.  As I said in my speech to the United Nations  General Assembly on 4 October:

 Nuclear disarmament and arms control are not matters  exclusively for those great powers which currently  possess nuclear weapons.  For if there is a nuclear 

 conflict, it is not just the peoples of the nuclear

 5

 weapon states who will suffer.  The peoples of the  world will be devastated.  As the potential victims of  nuclear catastrophe, the people of all nations have the  right to demand real progress and the eventual 

 elimination of nuclear weapons.  They have the right to  demand that the nuclear arms race not take new forms,   including its spread into outer space.

 In the economic and trade sphere our overriding interest,  as a commodity producer with growing exports in services  and high technology products, is in trying to secure a free  and liberal international trading regime. We need a  stable, rational and equitable system that allows us 

 reasonable market access, but all too often the 

 international trading environment diverges from this model,   restricted by tariffs, non-tariff protective measures,  competition from subsidised exports, so-called "voluntary"  restraint arrangements,  or straight out political 

 influence. Our stake in a secure international economic  environment also encompasses international banking,  investment and technology flows,  our transport links and  communications - and the whole complex web of bilateral and  multilateral arrangements that help or hinder them as the 

 case may be.

 The third group of national interests I indentified were  those involved in being, and being seen to be, a good  international citizen.  Global environment problems like  the ozone layer require global solutions: so do 

 international health problems like AIDS, or the 

 international narcotics trade, or unregulated population  flows, or those other unhappy phenomena being increasingly  referred to these days (though more for graphic impact than 

 conceptual clarity, I suspect) as "non-military threats to  security".  We have a role to play in all these areas, just  as we do in other fields of international action such as 

 decolonisation, peacekeeping, and the whole arms control  agenda.

 6

 Part of our role in all of this involves an extension into  our foreign relations of the basic values of the Australian  community: values which are at the core of our sense of  self and which a democratic community expects its 

 government to pursue, and values of which in this, our  Bicentennial year, we both take stock and celebrate.  It is  proper, if for no other reason than to maintain our own  sense of worth in pursuing ends that are inherently  valuable, to seek improved standards worldwide in human 

 rights and equal opportunity; to work for an end to 

 apartheid in South Africa and racial intolerance everywhere  else; to try and remove the barbarism of the death penalty;  and to assist through substantial aid programs the economic  and social development of those countries struggling with  debt, poverty or national calamity. In the longer term the  evolution of just and tolerant societies brings its own 

 international returns - in higher standards of 

 international behaviour, and in the contribution that  internal stability makes to international stability and  peace.

 In terms of the domestic returns from the pursuit of these  kinds of objectives, whether there are any more concrete  spin-offs than a warm inner glow is somewhat conjectural.   Although I don't pretend that there will not also be  occasions when taking a principled stand carries costs for  us, including commercially, I do believe that an 

 international reputation as a good citizen in the kinds of  senses I have mentioned enhances any country's overall  standing in the world, and that there will be occasions  when this reputation will prove helpful to us in pursuing  our other international interests,  including commercial  ones.

 It is one thing to define and clarify foreign policy 

 interests in this way, but quite another to advance them: 

 interests,  in the real world, are not the same as 

 influence.  But it also has to be recognised that influence  in turn, is not something that is necessarily quickly or

 7

 easily measured.  It involves assessing, in the first  place, the potential or prima facie capacity for exercising  influence a country has in pursuing that particular  interest - the assets it can deploy; but then also taking 

 into account, on the other side of the ledger, the various  constraints, internal and external, .that in practice stand  in the way of that capacity being applied. Actual 

 opportunities for influence in pursuing an interest are, in  the diplomatic marketplace, what is left over when  capacities are discounted by constraints.

 On the face of it, our capacity to exercise any real 

 influence on matters of global war, peace and disarmament  is so limited that any attempt to exert it would be 

 Quixotic. But our hosting of the joint facilities,  especially Pine Gap and Nurrungar with their unique  intelligence gathering, arms control and disarmament  verification, and early warning functions, gives us the 

 access and opportunity to regularly put views at the  highest level to the United States administration. That,  together with the thought and effort that has gone into  developing and articulating arms control strategies, and  the highly visible role we have played in multilateral 

 forums in promoting nuclear nonproliferation and other  disarmament objectives, for example the outlawing of  chemical weapons, has made us highly respected 

 interlocutors on these subjects, not only in Washington,  but in Moscow, Beijing and around the globe. At the end of  the day we have nothing like the clout of the main nuclear  players at the table, but nobody could argue, given the  nature of the issues involved, that the game is not worth 

 the candle.

 At the other end of the scale of geopolitical interests one 

 comes across situations where our influence is rather less  than it may appear at first sight. Take Fiji. Australia 

 has significant strategic and security reasons, quite apart  from human rights value preferences, for wishing to see a

 8

 stable, prosperous and racially harmonious Fiji. And by  any objective measure we bring solid assets to the 

 bilateral relationship.  Australia is far and away Fiji's  largest economic partner.  We have the largest military  capacity of all countries of the South Pacific region.  We  have an extensive network of people-to-people links,   through tourism, business, education and official visits, 

 and a long history of work together in the Commonwealth and 

 South Pacific Forum.

 But there are constraints which prevent the full 

 utilisation of these assets.  There was never any question  of deploying our military capacity, not just because nobody  ever asked us to, but because the situation demanded a  political, not a military solution; no major group has  sought the continued application of economic sanctions,  official or unofficial; and nobody has reacted very warmly  to the notion of using aid funds, whether regular or  supplementary, by way of either carrot or stick. Our oral 

 encouragement to those advocating the resumption of  constitutional democracy and Western liberal values has  been of at best marginal utility: the very characteristics 

 that may at first sight seem influential - our 

 disproportionate size, wealth, state of political and  economic development, and liberal democratic tradition -  make it easy to paint us, however carefully we may tread  (and I think it is fair to claim our touch has been 

 measurably lighter than New Zealand's throughout) as  uncomprehending, domineering and patronising.

 Another very significant constraint in Australia's response  to the evolving situation in Fiji has been the reaction of 

 its Pacific island neighbours,  whether Melanesian,  Micronesian or Polynesian. Very few appreciated,  let alone  applauded, the military means by which Fiji's indigenous 

 nationalism asserted itself; but anyone who believes the 

 political end thus achieved was itself perceived as wholly  unacceptable, has not spent much time with an ear to the

 9

 ground in the Pacific. In an environment where Australia  has identified its interests in its relationship with its  South Pacific neighbours as best served by a strategy of  "constructive commitment", involving a spirit of 

 partnership rather then dominance, mutual respect for  sovereignty and national individuality, and the development  of shared perceptions of regional strategic and security  interests, it would be self-defeating to ride roughshod 

 over that kind of reaction.

 In the conduct of trade and economic relations, Australia  can lay claim to several advantages such as a relatively  high GDP, an impressive standard of education, and a  well-developed communications system. While our manpower 

 base remains small, we have a huge stock of sought-after  resources, a sophisticated industrial and technological  base gradually emerging from several lifetimes of 

 protective sheltering, and an increasing willingness to  take our economic chances domestically and internationally  in a free market environment.  But, particularly in the 

 arena of multilateral trade negotiations, these assets do  not of themselves give us any particular influence.

 Accordingly, in pursuit of such crucial national goals as a  fair international agricultural regime, one which exposes  producers in Europe, the United States, Japan and elsewhere  to the realities of a market place in which for once we can  hold our own, we have had to judge how best to maximise our 

 influence. Since Australia is only one - and not among the  biggest - participant in the MTN round, we cannot depend  solely on our own advocacy to secure a successful outcome.   Saying it should be so would not make it so.

 We concluded that the most effective way of coping with  this gap between what we wanted and what we have the 

 capacity to achieve, was to build a coalition of allies: a 

 group of agricultural traders that could become a real  "third force" in the MTN after the United States and the  European community. So we did just that, and set about

 10

 under John Dawkins, as then Trade Minister, tying together  an otherwise extraordinarily disparate group of Latin 

 Americans, East Europeans, South East Asians and old  Commonwealth countries.  The Cairns Group coalition has  achieved considerable progress, with both the US and the EC  openly suggesting that it could provide the way through the 

 present early and mid-term deadlocks.

 Holding the Group together for the remainder of the Uruguay 

 Round, as national self-interest and domestic political  necessity come up hard against the broad-based ideal of  genuine market reform, is not going to be easy. But as an  exercise in pursuing vital interests with limited assets, 

 it has been an object lesson in doing more with less.

 In pursuing good international citizenship objectives, the  asset that matters most is, simply, credibility, and here  we start with a reasonably strong asset base. This 

 includes a strong internal tradition of western liberal  democracy (if not an absolutely ideal constitution); a very  strong record of commitment to multilateral institutions  and codes, symbolised early on by Dr Î. V. Evatt's 

 passionate devotion to the UN, and in particular to the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the  General Assembly during his Presidency forty years ago this  week; a continuing leading role in the international  campaign against apartheid, an important legitimate 

 touchstone of moral credibility in most of the developing  world; and a longstanding willingness to accept the  resettlement of more than our fair share of the world’s 

 refugees, particularly those from our own region.

 All of this helps us get results when we go out pursuing  good citizenship causes,  whether it be the commutation of  death sentences passed on Buddhist monks in Vietnam; the  development of a regional consensus behind a new 

 international Chemical Weapons Convention; or the promotion 

 of new international strategies to cope with the Greenhouse  Effect.

 But here, as elsewhere, there are constraints. For a start  one has to be acutely concious of the likely impact of a  given initiative, particularly in human rights related  matters where the life or health of individuals may be  concerned, and that is not always easy to assess. The  object of these initiatives, which is not always

 appreciated by those who preach or practice feel-good  politics, must be not to satisfy a domestic constituency or  some other perceived political imperative, but to get  positive - and not counterproductive - results.

 Another important constraint is that our opportunity to  influence events depends, in this area more than anywhere  else, on keeping our domestic house absolutely in order.   Our ability to secure advances in the areas of human 

 rights, refugees or development assistance rests on our being, and continuing to be seen to be, a liberal democracy  with a solid record at home; a country which articulates  and applies human rights and similar principles with 

 absolute consistency and impartiality; a country which puts  our money where our mouth is when it comes to aid

 delivery. We won't achieve much if in our national 

 policies on Aboriginal affairs, immigration or the like we  are seen to be indulging in double standards.  Hypocrites  are not only disliked, in international relations as  elsewhere, but - if they are our size - they are ignored.

 In the preceding pages I have been trying to give some examples,  across the broad sweep of our national interests,  of the foreign policy decision making process at work, at  least as I understand it. It is a matter, in short, of 

 first identifying the relevant national interests - what it  is one is trying to achieve, or protect, and why; then assessing the available opportunities for influence in  pursuing them, which involves weighing up both of the 

 assets and constraints sides of the ledger;  and devising 

 strategies accordingly.

 11

 12

 I don't pretend, of course, that any of this is very new.  Thucydides's treatise on the Peloponnesian War employed  exactly the same concepts when he argued that the policies  and actions of states and their relations with each other  were determined by the synergy of their interests and 

 power.  The point I want to make is simply that,  hurled as  I now am into foreign relations not as a mere interested  spectator but a practitioner, I find this little bit of  conceptual apparatus in fact very helpful, not just for the  purpose of rationalising and writing it up after the event,  but for decision making itself.

 It is not as easy as it may sometimes seem to untangle  means and ends; real interests, lesser interests and  non-interests; real and apparent constraints; and  productive and counter-productive opportunities for 

 influence, when events are tumbling headlong around you.  If one is going to exercise careful, consistent judgment,  thinking effectively both in reaction to events and in  anticipation of them (and Foreign Ministers and their  advisers have to do this day in and day out, coping with  problems that usually do not present themselves in neat and  elegant packages), then it helps to have a simple, 

 systematic checklist of considerations to work through as  each new circumstance arises.

 My emphasis on the importance of being able to disentangle  the complex interrelationships between interests and  influence, is really just another way of stressing the  importance of effective political management to a 

 successful foreign policy. This is because, at the end of  the day, it is upon the management of the givens and the  intelligently anticipated that interests are advanced,  constraints minimised and influence nurtured.  Effective  political management does not mean all our endeavours will 

 succeed. It involves making sensible judgements and 

 retaining flexibility: the sorts of adjustments we have 

 made, I think successfully, in our relations with the South 

 Pacific, the United States, Japan and China,  to give a few 

 examples - adjustments that can accommodate change,  

 minimise frictions and keep expectations realistic.

 13

 Part of effective political management is to get the  machinery and the institutional structure right.  In this  respect, the amalgamation of the Departments of Foreign  Affairs and Trade - which is now bedding down very well in 

 practice - was a sensible and overdue step because no  effective foreign policy framework can afford to be  functionally divorced from questions of trade and

 international economic policy.

 It is also important to have the diplomatic resources to  secure timely and authoritative advice on developments in 

 countries of importance to us and to have a team of 

 professionals who can identify the significant trends and  anticipate where change is likely to impact on Australian  interests. In this regard, I think we are in good shape in  terms of quality both in Canberra and at our many posts  abroad, but quantity is becoming a problem. Stuart  Harris’s "Review of Overseas Representation" makes the  point very effectively that the kind of multidimensional 

 foreign policy we have been pursuing, in recent years, and  which I have been trying to here describe, will need more  resources in the future, not less. Some of this can be  coped with by flexible institutional structures, evolving 

 to meet continually changing circumstances,  but we are fast  coming to the limits of the art of the possible in this  respect.

 Informed and vigorous public debate can also contribute to  the successful management of foreign policy. This Government more than most has encouraged such debate and  sought to widen the dialogue among government,  academia and  non-government organisations. The latter in particular  make important contributions to humanitarian and development assistance programs,  to our international human 

 rights initiatives,  and to discussion of arms control and  disarmament issues.

 14

 Î¿

 t

 Probably most important of all to effective political  management in foreign affairs is developing a sense of  priorities, and a resource allocation strategy to match.  This is always easier said than imposed, in the untidy  world we inhabit, but something that has to be done in an 

 administrative and decision making environment where 

 resources are always limited.

 In terms of the interests/influence matrix that I have been  describing, priorities tend to define themselves as those  issues where a major interest coincides with at least some  opportunity to influence its achievement. While not  underestimating the need to maintain a proper understanding  of- everything significantly affecting our vital interests,  there is not a great deal of point in devoting major 

 resources to the pursuit of an interest, however inherently  important (or fashionable), which you know you are never  effectively going to be able to advance; nor is there much 

 to be gained, conversely, in devoting a great deal of  attention to something which is attainable, but inherently  trivial.

 From this kind of perspective, our highest foreign policy  priorities can perhaps be spelt out roughly as follows:  contributing to regional peace and stability in the South  Pacific and South East Asia, through regular contact and  cooperation with both indigenous and major external  players; maintaining effective working relationships with  our nearest strategically significant neighbours, Indonesia 

 and Papua New Guinea; tending our alliance relationship 

 with the United States; maintaining effective relations  with our major trading partners, especially in North East 

 Asia; expanding export markets through the freeing up of  international trade, especially in agriculture; working for  nuclear non-proliferation, and arms control generally; and  seeking to advance human rights values through bilateral 

 representations and, where appropriate, by joint action.

 15

 -  To list priorities in this rather mechanical way, however,  is to miss some of the essentially dynamic flavour of  foreign relations. Ultimately successful foreign policy,  like successful policy anywhere else in government, is  about the effective management of change. And this means  not only reacting effectively to the unpredicted, but 

 riding effectively the waves you do know are coming.

 It is obvious enough that there are a series of major new  world developments occurring, imminent or likely - to the  implications of which for Australia we should now be  allocating priority resources, or at least thinking time. 

 I am thinking, first, of the general movement toward a more  fluid, less ideologically divided and certainly less  bipolar world.  Secondly, there is the apparently (though  not necessarily) inexorable move toward world economic  dominance by the Asia-Pacific region - a region led by  Japan, economically if not politically, but highly pluralistic in character, and one in which, despite our  geographical association, we still don’t have much more  than a toe and finger hold. And thirdly, there is the  possible (although at this stage hopefully unlikely)  movement towards trade-restrictive economic blocs in Europe 

 and North America if the GATT/MTN process falls into a  hole, which would create a huge problem for Australia  especially if we cannot negotiate any compensatory role in  a comparable regional bloc of our own.

 This is not the occasion to try and place an order of 

 probability on these various possible developments being  carried through, or to try and analyse in detail their  implications for Australia if they are.  My focus today has  been more on the underlying dynamics of Australian foreign  policy decision making,  as I understand them, rather than 

 the substantive content of those decisions.

 But what one can at least say is that, if we are indeed on  the threshold of a "Pacific Century",  then Australia is, if  not entirely poised to take advantage of this historic  moment, at least no longer trapped in attitudes towards its 

 own region that are dictated by fear, suspicion and  ignorance.

 We approach a potentially major new era in our region  harbouring no secret Monroe Doctrine.  We should welcome  the evidence that our region is becoming more open, less  ideologically divided, particularly because in other parts  of the world a form of closed regionalism is possibly  emerging. We should welcome the opportunity to play a  part, as one nation among many, in a framework which is 

 likely to be neither one-world, nor a bipolar world  dominated by nuclear giants, nor a traditional form of  power rivalry in which one gain is always at another's  expense, but a possible equilibrium in which power is 

 shared, change is managed with political skill and the  resulting prosperity is widely enjoyed.

 But that is all to leap ahead, and it is time to conclude  by returning to where I began. I see Australia's place in  the world evolving, here as elsewhere, within the framework  of a foreign policy that is focused on security, economic  and humanitarian interests, but a framework in which those  national interests are pursued by reference to a realistic  assessment of the influence that Australia can wield  through maximising its assets and managing the many  constraints in its way.

 No nation's foreign policy can mould the world in its  image. A sensible foreign policy takes the world as it is,  knows what it wants, and tries as best it can to ensure  that the currents of change flow in its direction, and  Australia's should be no exception.
