 Gary Hardgrave MP   Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs 

   Media Release H18/2003 - 17 February 2003

 

 Kakuma Visit: Minister To Look at Settlement Issues 

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, left yesterday on a 13-day overseas visit to Kenya, the United Kingdom and Canada.

 Mr Hardgrave will discuss with overseas counterparts refugee resettlement issues, migration  agent legislation and community harmony initiatives.

 The Minister will be visiting the Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya to observe the conditions  experienced by refugees. 

 'Kakuma is one of the major refugee source camps for Australia and the Australian High  Commission in Nairobi has the largest allocation of places under the Offshore Humanitarian  Program, accounting for approximately 40% of the African caseload,' he said.

 'The Nairobi centre processes over 2,000 humanitarian entrants to Australia each year and  many of these people come from Kakuma. The focus for this year's humanitarian entrant  intake has shifted more to Africa, from where we expect approximately 40% of all offshore  Humanitarian entrants to come.''

 'People resettling in Australia from situations like these in Kakuma have special settlement  needs,' Mr Hardgrave said. 

 'Australia's settlement services such as the Adult Migrant English Program and Translating  and Interpreting Service are world-class,' he said.

 Mr Hardgrave will meet with immigration officials and government ministers in Britain and  Canada to discuss citizenship, community cohesion, race equality issues and the settlement  experiences of migrants.

 'On this visit I will be sharing Australia's experience of providing innovative and extensive  settlement services with counterparts overseas,' he said. 'Immigration has been fundamental  to the building of modern Australia and is vital to our continued development as a vibrant,  multicultural society that has much to offer the world. 

 'Britain, in particular, is very interested in our settlement programs and the White Paper on  citizenship incorporates much of the Australian approach to citizenship ceremonies and the  importance of a public pledge of commitment and loyalty to one's country.' Mr Hardgrave will  lead affirmation ceremonies in Britain and Canada for expatriate Australian citizens.
