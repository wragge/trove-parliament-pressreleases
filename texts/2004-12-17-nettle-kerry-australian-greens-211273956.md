 Greens call for Christmas compassion for  refugees 

 17th December  2004 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today joined local activists in Penrith in a  protest outside Liberal MP Jackie Kelly's office to raise awareness that  hundreds of asylum seekers, including children, remain locked up over  Christmas.    

 "The Greens are calling on the government to show some Christmas  compassion and agree to reassess the cases of all Iranian asylum  seekers in order to halt the ongoing hunger strike at Baxter Detention  Centre," Senator Nettle said.    

 "Even if the Minister won't agree to release asylum seekers then at  least she should act to save these Iranian men who have been driven  to desperation by their long incarceration and threat of forced 

 deportation.    

 "It's important that Australians are reminded that hundreds of men  women and children will remain locked up in detention centres this  Christmas, most of whom have been there for years.    

 "This festive season, whilst writing Christmas cards to friends and  family, The Greens are asking all those concerned at the plight of  asylum seekers in Australia to write to Amanda Vanstone and let her  know that they do not support the ongoing detention of asylum  seekers.    

 "Local activists around Australia will be taking action this weekend to  raise awareness of the ongoing plight of asylum seekers and in  particular the 25 Iranians who are on hunger strike at Baxter 

 Immigration Detention Centre.  

 

 The Greens policy calls for all asylum seekers to be released from  detention on temporary visas whilst their claims for asylum are  assessed.
