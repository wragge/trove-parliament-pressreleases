 Pacific Solution Budget Blackhole

 Revelations that the so called ‘Pacific solution’ for asylum seekers is estimated to cost at least $400-$500M underscores how misguided the Government and Opposition approach on asylum seekers has been, Australian Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.

 “This is $500M the Government has effectively taken out of education and health to prop up an inhumane and unworkable approach to the asylum seekers,” Senator Brown said.

 “This is a covert budget black hole. It should be fixed by ending the Pacific solution now. Asylum seekers should be brought to mainland Australia and processed as quickly as possible here.

 “The Pacific solution is no solution at all. It will not last and the Government knows it. It was a short term election fix for which all Australians are now paying a huge financial as well as humanitarian cost,” Senator Brown said.
