 GRAVE CONCERN FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS ON HUNGER STRIKE

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, expressed his deep regret today at  the worsening condition of three female asylum seekers on  hunger strike in Sydney.

 1 1  Such actions serve no purpose except to cause harm to  themselves, distress to all who are charged with their care,  their fellow detainees with whom they have formed close  relationships and their families outside Australia.

 "Two of these people heard yesterday that their appeals  against the rejection of their refugee applications had also  been rejected.

 "Once they are well enough to travel,  arrangements for their  removal from Australia will be put in train by my  Department.

 "If their long protest has been -intended to encourage me to  intervene in the refugee process, then their action has been  pointless and an unnecessary, risk to their long-term health.

 "As I have said many times before, I will not intervene in  the decision-making process for refugee applications," said  Mr Hand.
