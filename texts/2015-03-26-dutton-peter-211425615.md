 A new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Kingdom of Cambodia will further  strengthen co-operation on irregular migration, people smuggling and trafficking.     

 The agreement between Australia and the Cambodia was signed by the Minister for Immigration  and Border Protection Peter Dutton and visiting Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister  of the Interior His Excellency Sar Kheng today at Parliament House.     

 Mr Dutton said this agreement will create a framework to guide cooperation between the two  countries covering a range of areas of immigration including technical assistance, exchange of  experts, bilateral projects and activities.    

 “It also provides for regular consultation and information sharing on transnational criminal issues  that affect the two countries,” Mr Dutton said.     

 “This new MoU is further evidence of the increasing ties between Australia and Cambodia and  follows on from the MoU signed last year on the settlement of refugees in Cambodia.     

 “The agreement represents the renewed determination by Australia and Cambodia to work  closely to counter the growing security threat posed by transnational crime and illegal migration  practices.”   

 His Excellency Sar Kheng welcomed the MoU as a clear example of Cambodia’s commitment to  work with Australia and other concerned countries on the problems associated with people  smuggling and to share information and expertise. 

 

 “This MoU will enhance the effectiveness of the Australia-Cambodia Immigration Forum, through  which both our Governments engage in bilateral projects and activities, including technical  projects  to develop our capacity to fight this growing international criminal activity,” His  Excellency Sar Kheng said.      

 Both Ministers agreed that their ultimate objective was to promote the legal movement of people  across their respective borders.
