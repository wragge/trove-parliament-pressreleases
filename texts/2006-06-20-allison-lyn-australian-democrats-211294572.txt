 ANOTHER MOVE TOWARDS PARLIAMENTARY DICTATORSHIP

 Democrats' leader, Senator Lyn Allison said, the Government's moves to dismantle the Senate  Committee structure is another grab for power.   

 "Slashing the number of committees and taking over the chairing of all committees is a blatant move to  stifle scrutiny and criticism of the Government's agenda.   

 "This is another move towards parliamentary dictatorship.   

 "Since the Coalition took control of the Senate, it has refused to agree to more than half of the proposed  references committee inquiries on topics including the involvement of the AWB in the Iraq Oil-for-food  Programme, processes for assisting refugees and humanitarian visa holders, Australia's future energy  supply and the impact of proposed cross media laws.   

 "After the 2004 election the Prime Minister said, 'I want to assure the Australian people that the  Government will use its majority in the new Senate very carefully, very wisely and not provocatively.' It is  hard to see how this move is in line with that pronouncement.    

 "The Coalition always wanted to reduce the Senate to a benign rubber stamp for the executive in the  House of Representatives. This is just another nail in the coffin of our democracy," concluded Senator  Allison.
