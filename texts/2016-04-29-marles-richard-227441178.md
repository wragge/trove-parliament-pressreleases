 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO    

 DEATH OF ASYLUM SEEKER 

 

 The confirmation that a 23 year-old asylum seeker has today died in a Brisbane  Hospital following injuries sustained during an incident on Nauru is an absolute  tragedy.    

 Labor extends its condolences to the manâ€™s wife and his family and friends.     

 Labor continues to call on Mr Turnbull to urgently secure a third country arrangement  that offers refugees a viable long term settlement future.
