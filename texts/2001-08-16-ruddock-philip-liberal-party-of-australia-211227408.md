 Rebuttal of Four Corners Program MPS 118/2001

 There has been a lot of misinformation and factual inaccuracies circulating over the past few days about Australia's detention policies and practices particularly arising from Monday's Four Corners report.

 I think this has been generated with, among other things, a clear aim of obtaining a different outcome for people who have been found not to be refugees.

 Let me try and put some balance into the scenario painted by the Four Corners program.

 All of the people interviewed for the program have had their claims assessed by one of the most thorough protection assessment processes in the world.  

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Of the five people featured on Four Corners, all were refused protection at the primary stage; all were refused protection by the independent Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT), one person on two separate occasions. Four sought further review unsuccessfully by the Federal Court and two have also appealed at the High Court. In the High Court case finalised, the court found for the Minister.  

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Like all people seeking asylum they have had access to a Government funded provider to assist in preparing their application for a protection visa, and in the review process.  

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 There are at least three interviews to elicit their claims before the first or primary decision on refugee status is made. The three interviews are:

 The initial entry interview with immigration staff. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

   An interview with the Immigration Asylum Advice and Assistance Scheme provider in order to help ensure the asylum seeker puts forward their claim in the best way possible and that all pertinent information is included.  

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The protection visa interview with an experienced and well-trained immigration case officer who is also the primary decision-maker for the application. This interview is thorough and not time-limited and qualified interpreters are used.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 No decision is made without the opportunity for the asylum seeker to put their claims in writing and to have them fully and comprehensively considered.

 Furthermore people in detention are given priority at the primary and review stage.

 The five people interviewed on Four Corners received their primary decisions within three weeks to three months of making an application, depending on the complexity of the case.

 As stated earlier all five applied to the RRT and were refused, four went on to the Federal Court and two to the High Court.

 None of them were found to be refugees.

 What does this tell you?

 It tells you that up to five separate authorities have determined that these people are not refugees…only some sections of the media seem to think they are.

 Our asylum system has been endorsed by the UNHCR as one of the best in the world.

 When I say people have been refused refugee status it means their claims have been thoroughly and exhaustively tested.

 Our determination system is backed up by one of the most comprehensive country information systems in the world.

 Our Country Information Service (CIS) collects detailed information from a wide range of sources, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, other governments, human rights organisations, international media and academics.

 The CIS has more than 36,000 items on 124 countries in its on-line database and more than 5,000 titles in its library.

 Unlike the footage shown on Four Corners, our information is up to date.

 There is no point in putting people through an extensive determination process if you allow people who have been rejected to stay.

 The effect of that would be to throw open your borders. The most potent message for people smugglers is to remove people who have no right to stay.

 Anyone in my position as Minister for Immigration must be prepared to make these tough decisions. The nation would expect this.

 In this context now let's look briefly at some of the uncritical and unbalanced material presented on the Four Corners program.

 It's nonsense to suggest you cannot talk to anyone while in detention. Once through initial processing, people are free to make contact with whomever they wish.  

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 I can categorically assure you there will be no reprisals against detainees who raise concerns or issues about detention.  

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Contrary to claims by Four Corners that the media has no access to detention centres, the program is clearly unaware that the ABC participated in at least four media tours of detention facilities this year.  

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Four Corners uncritically reported that detainees in Villawood have nothing to do, when in fact they have access to 12 televisions, ten newspaper titles including 15 copies of the Daily Telegraph and a range of other recreational and sporting facilities - this is a little different from the picture painted by the ABC.  

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The ABC also consistently gets it wrong when talking about escapees. Of the 46 detainees who recently escaped from Villawood only 25 had even applied for asylum (protection visa), all but four of these 25 have been found not to be refugees. The remaining four cases are yet to be determined.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Some sections of the media appear to be constantly asking the question why don't we release people into the community.

 Let's look at the experience of the United Kingdom. The Immigration and Nationality Directorate at the Home Office recently stated that the total number of asylum seekers living illegally in the UK could be as high as 250,000.

 As a result, the British Government has now constructed one detention centre for illegal immigrants and has three other such facilities in planning. Canada, Sweden and the US all have recently introduced or expanded detention programs for unlawful arrivals.

 Many comments have been made about our treatment of children in detention.

 Australia's migration law requires that all unlawful non-citizens must be detained.

 Under this legislation, no differentiation is made in the treatment of adults and minors, with children in their own right legally assuming the same immigration status as their parents.

 It is worth remembering that just last week the project to trial alternative detention arrangements for women and children began in Woomera.

 Any applications from children and family units in detention are processed as a matter of priority.

 My Department and I take duty of care obligations towards detainees very seriously, in particular in regard to the detention of minors.

 We insist that the detention services provider offers appropriate facilities and services to meet the special needs of children and families. Suitable accommodation for family units and children are made available where possible and recreational facilities including playgrounds, toys and games are provided.

 Children in all detention centres have access to a range of services including educational facilities and health and welfare services and pyschological services.

 Criteria for the release of children on a bridging visa hinge on appropriate care and welfare arrangements with the best interests of the child being the primary consideration. Generally, it is not in the best interests of a child to be separated from their parents or family.

 With particular reference to the young boy featured on Four Corners, apart from his having access to the normal range of facilities as mentioned above, the boy has been promptly given all necessary emergency treatment in hospital (on at least seven occasions) and has been seen regularly by medical staff at the centre.

 The ABC had also reported on the news on Tuesday night that the father had been taken to Stage 1 (the high security area) of Villawood " and has not been heard from since ". This is completely untrue. He was interviewed by officials in the conference room in Stage 2, the compound where he usually resides with his family, on Tuesday afternoon. Arrangements for the ongoing care of his son were discussed. He confirmed his agreement to a foster place for the boy. After the interview, the father left the room and met with his lawyer and family in the general compound and went about his own business unhindered.

 The ABC has also aired claims that the boy witnessed the self-immolation of detainees at Woomera. There have been no incidents of self-immolation at the Woomera facility. Other than that fact I am unable to comment upon what the boy thought he saw.

 Similarly, claims that the boy " witnessed the attempted suicide" of a man at Villawood and "saw him lying in a pool of blood" is also grossly overstated. It is understood that the boy saw the man bleeding, not profusely, from his lower forearm outside the man's room.

 It has also been claimed that the boy has been released from Westmead Hospital and is now back in detention. Again, this is simply untrue. The boy remains in the care of Westmead Hospital and continues to make a good recovery.

 I have asked for an independent physical and psychological assessment of the boy's condition, as well as a psychological profile of the whole family in order that I can properly consider future management options whilst the family awaits removal.
