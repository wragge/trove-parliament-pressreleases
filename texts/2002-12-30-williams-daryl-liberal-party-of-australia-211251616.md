 ATTORNEY-GENERAL   THE HON. DARYL WILLIAMS AM QC MP 

 

 TRANSCRIPT 

 Doorstop 

 Tangney Electorate Office 

 10.30am (WST), 30 December 2002 

 Subject: Detention centre fires……………………………………………………………e&oe   

 WILLIAMS 

 It is very disappointing that there have been these arson attacks on the immigration centres.  The damage done at the Baxter centre in the first fire in the Red 1 compound is estimated to  have cost some $2 million. The second set of fires that were in the Red 2 compound, where  the occupants of Red 1 were moved, is estimated to have cost approximately another quarter  of a million dollars. The fire at the Port Hedland immigration centre, which started initially  under the fire-fighting vehicle which was destroyed and was then moved into an unoccupied  accommodation centre used for storage, and the preliminary estimated cost of damage there is  $3 million. This is an appalling waste of taxpayers money and it’s also deplorable that  people’s lives and safety are put at risk, not only the staff, but other detainees and then of  course the fire fighters who have to go in to stop the damage. 

 REPORTER 

 It was very well orchestrated to target the fire truck first and also there had been warnings that  something like this was going to happen.  Had there been any preparations been made to  expect any trouble seeing as that some of the detainees had said there was going to be  something happening? 

 WILLIAMS 

 Well I don’t know what the detainees have been telling you, but there are well coordinated  responses in place and of course there are staff there who are responsible for security at all  times.  

 REPORTER 

 They weren’t telling me, they were telling the guards there was going to be trouble - that is  what they had warned of this weekend, what would normally happen in a situation like that ?  Would any extra security set up? 

 WILLIAMS 

 It would be for the management of the centre to make an appropriate response and I assume  appropriate responses were given, but I don’t have any briefing on that detail. 

 REPORTER 

 Will there be criminal charges laid?

 WILLIAMS 

 Well the Federal Police are investigating what’s occurred at Baxter and hopefully they will  identify those responsible and they will be prosecuted and convicted and dealt with. The WA  Police are investigating what has occurred at Port Hedland. 

 REPORTER 

 Why aren’t Federal Police involved here in WA?  

 WILLIAMS 

 The Federal Police are not based in Port Hedland, the WA Police are based there. 

 REPORTER 

 Do you admit though it will be difficult to find exactly who’s responsible considering there  were at least 30 involved and they are not exactly going to start dobbing in their mates are  they? 

 WILLIAMS 

 Well I think the difficulty of getting admissible evidence to convict somebody on the basis of  beyond reasonable doubt, shouldn’t be under-estimated. There were 55 occupants of the Red  1 compound at the time the fires were started and 55 possible suspects is a lot of people to  cover and if they are not cooperating and it’s not likely they will cooperate, it may be very  difficult to identify those who are directly responsible. 

 REPORTER 

 What do you say to refugee action groups who say - well this is an act of desperation, these  people are being treated like animals therefore they will act like animals and this is a  desperate call for help if you like? 

 WILLIAMS 

 Well all of the people involved in Red 1 compound in Baxter have had an application for  refugee status refused, they are at liberty to return whence they came at any time, it’s their  decision. I don’t regard their actions as actions of desperation, I regard them as actions of  determination. They’re determined to coerce the Australian Government into giving them  something that has been determined they are not entitled to. The Government will not be  coerced and actions like that can only count against their applications rather than in support of  them.   

 REPORTER 

 (inaudible) 

 WILLIAMS 

 I am not aware of the detail of the Port Hedland  people. The fires occurred in relation to the  fire-fighting vehicle and in an unoccupied building used for storage, so I can’t comment. 

 REPORTER 

 (inaudible) 

 WILLIAMS 

 Well the difficulty with deporting people is that with some countries there are no  arrangements for returning detainees, with other detainees they destroy their identity papers,  those who come with the assistance of people smugglers usually destroy their identity papers  and then there is difficulty identifying who they are and what country they came from.

 REPORTER 

 What is being done in other detention centres around the country to prevent similar attacks?   

 WILLIAMS 

 Well the management of the detention centres will be well aware of what’s occurred at Baxter  and what’s occurred at Port Hedland and they will be taking appropriate steps. The  appropriate steps in the normal course of events would be to provide additional staff to 

 supervise the operations of the centre. 

 REPORTER 

 Residents nearby in Port Hedland had to be evacuated for their own safety last night. What  kind of guarantees can you give for their safety and for the safety of their property? 

 WILLIAMS 

 Well the management of the centre will no doubt be taking additional steps. The fires are  under control, I think some of them smouldered for quite some time maybe they were the  cause of the additional damage. But the management of the centre knows what the risks are  now and they must face them. 

 REPORTER 

 Mr Williams just on the Federal police issue, you’ve said the they are not based there but  could the Federal police take over the matter? 

 WILLIAMS 

 It depends on the nature of the investigation.  The WA Police and the Federal Police have  cooperative arrangements and each can investigate both Commonwealth and State offences  and given that the WA Police are based in Port Hedland it is appropriate they do. But they can  investigate both a possible State offence like arson and a possible Commonwealth offences,  like damage to Commonwealth property. 

 REPORTER 

 (inaudible) 

 WILLIAMS 

 Well I expect there will be charges of that sort laid, if the people responsible can be identified. 

 REPORTER 

 And if charges are laid that would in fact lengthen their stay wouldn’t it - I mean obviously  through the court process? 

 WILLIAMS  

 Well it would depend on the individual circumstances of the detainees. If they are convicted  and sentenced to imprisonment, which is only a possibility at this point, they would serve  their time in prison and then be subject to immigration laws which may result in their  deportation. 

 REPORTER 

 (inaudible)

 WILLAMS 

 They will be in detention whether they it’s in an immigration detention centre or whether they  are refused bail and held in a prison. 

 REPORTER 

 Was Port Hedland a copycat kind of attack ? 

 WILLAMS 

 Well it looks like a copycat arson on the basis that those at the Port Hedland centre would  have known through television and newspapers what had occurred at Baxter. 

 REPORTER 

 And how is that likely to affect the rest of the detainees in those detention centres? 

 WILLIAMS 

 Well only those in the relevant compound at Baxter are affected. There were no women or  children involved, they were all single males and they were moved from Red 1 compound to  Red 2 compound and the fire started there they remained in Red 2 compound overnight, but I  am not at present aware whether they have been moved again. 

 REPORTER 

 What about Port Hedland? 

 WILLIAMS 

 No I don’t have the detail on Port Hedland. 

 REPORTER 

 Mr Williams what is the situation at the Perth detention centre, I heard there were riots there  on Christmas Day? 

 WILLIAMS 

 I’d have to get a briefing to answer that question, I am not aware of that. 

 REPORTER 

 What is the situation there like generally though? 

 WILLIAMS 

 Well I have no report of anything untoward at the Perth detention centre, the immigration  centre.
