 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON KIM C  BEAZLEY MP   

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVIEW , TWEED HEADS SOUTH, 8  JUNE 2005    

 E & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects: Pensioners Dental Care; Wayne Swan; Chen Yonglin;  Airport Security   

 BEAZLEY: Thank you for coming here.  We’re here today to receive a petition  that has been organised in Justine Elliott’s constituency here, 4000 signatures  related to the delays in the ability in particularly elderly people to get the dental  treatment they need.  My mum used to say to me, well actually she still does,  she’s still alive but when you get to her age, the two things that you worry most 

 about are your teeth and your feet.  Well we’re here to deal with the teeth today it  goes to the heart of the health and dignity of elderly Australians.  And it’s a cop-out on the part of the Commonwealth that they have dropped out of what was  once a substantial Commonwealth contribution to the Dental Program.    

 We’ve got now something like 500,000 people on an unacceptable waiting list  around the country.  Every election we have gone to so far and next election will  be no different, the Labor Party has gone on the basis of the restoration of  Commonwealth involvement in the Dental Program.  It’s a constitutional  obligation on the Commonwealth and it’s time this Commonwealth Government,  after 10 years, took it seriously.  Around here there are, as you can see from the  petition of 4,000 people they’re a huge number, greatly inconvenienced,  embarrassed and more than embarrassment, experiencing, as a result of the  inadequate access of dental facilities, a considerable impact on their health as  well.     

 So, Justine is doing a sterling job in making sure this issue comes before the  Commonwealth Parliament and I’ll be delighted in joining her in presenting the  petition.   

 JOURNALIST: Is it that most people here can’t afford the services or there  aren’t enough dentists?   

 BEAZLEY:   It goes to the question of affordability very quickly.  The  elderly simply can’t afford current prices, dentists, and there’s not doubt at all that  if they could that backlog could be cleared very quickly.  The promise that we  came out with at the last election would have provided for something like one and 

 a half million services.  And that would more than amply have cleared the  backlog if the Government was prepared to take it up.  That’s not unaffordable,  its a few hundred million dollars, so it’s something the Commonwealth can do,  constitutionally obliged to do and should so. 

 

 JOURNALIST: How are your teeth?   

 BEAZLEY:  My teeth are fine.  What do they say in Chinatown? I’ve still  got a few teeth in my head and a few friends downtown.   

 JOURNALIST: Speaking of China Mr Beazley, are you happy with the way  the Government is looking after Mr Chen?   

 BEAZLEY:  We’re looking for a briefing on this.  We regard this matter  very seriously.  We want to know what the Government’s rationale is for its  position.  We don’t go off on these things without being properly informed and  Kevin Rudd is seeking that proper information.     

 JOURNALIST: It does seem bizarre.  One minute he’s saying he has  applied for asylum and another is saying he never asked for it.   

 BEAZLEY:  That’s this Government and this Government is magnificent  at spin of getting its politics out there, getting its politics right.  But when it comes  to delivery on anything, they’re absolutely appalling. 

 

 JOURNALIST: There’s news that another one may have come forward this  morning.  Are we in danger of getting into a mess?   

 BEAZLEY:  I think the Government is struggling with it frankly.  How  much it’s struggling with it we don’t yet know and because these are serious  issues we’ll always wait until we’ve got substantial information before we respond  formally ourselves.  We have not yet had that briefing.   

 JOURNALIST: Alexander Downer is overseas.  Should he come back to  deal with this properly or is Vanstone enough to do it?   

 BEAZLEY:  He’s got a telephone, Alexander, and he can use it and he  can get the thing done and it does need to be resolved.   

 JOURNALIST: Are you confident (inaudible) the Chinese Ambassador has  said that if Mr Chen does go back to China that they’ve got laws in place now to  look after him.   Are you confident that he would be looked after? 

 

 BEAZLEY:  I wouldn’t want to assume that until I’d seen the product of  the proper briefing of one of our Members.  Kevin Rudd is an absolute expert on 

 China he can make sensible judgments and ask reasonable questions of the  officials when they get around to briefing.   

 JOURNALIST: On Wayne Swan, there’s pressure for you to dump him from  the front bench, what’s your response to that?   

 BEAZLEY:  I have total confidence in Wayne Swan.  He’s doing a good  job and he’s doing an essential thing for the community.  He’s holding this  Government to account on their management of the economy.  I did see mention  in that story about the number of questions asked, can I say this: you go to any  comparable period in the last four or five years of our time in Opposition, you  won’t find as many questions asked on the economy as we have.  And the  reason why we’re asking questions is that we are concerned, we think the  Government has dropped the ball on management of this economy.  We’ve got  foreign debt going through the roof they used to have a debt truck we now talk  about a debt convoy.  We have got an appalling position in our current account  deficit and we have had 46 years of trade deficits in the monthly returns and that  is, it’s not been anything like that for a very long period of time and you’ve got the  Reserve Bank out there saying the Government should be doing something  about skills, doing something about infrastructure.  We’ve got the Commonwealth  Government out there doing it’s best to point its finger at the States.  So, we have  been in there strongly on those issues.  We’ve been in there strongly on tax too.   Tax goes to the Senate next week, we say bring it on immediately.  Make  absolutely certain that the Senate has the opportunity to debate Labor’s fair Tax  Package and then if we succeed in the Senate ask Costello this question: why  are you blocking a decent tax cut for seven million Australians?  Why do you  arrogantly turn your back on the people who are making a difference in this  society, supporting our families and who deserve more than this form of derision?   

 JOURNALIST:  (Inaudible)  stalling  tactic, what would you say to that?   

 BEAZLEY:  I’d say this Government hates a debate.  They really do not  want the light shone on what they are doing in their taxation legislation.  They will  talk about anything, any procedural issue, any personal issue, they will do 

 anything but talk about what they’re doing with their tax package in which some  people in this society, millionaires, get $65 a week and seven million Australians  get $6.  And we saw again today some reporting that what happens at the bottom  end of the income scale, how much is lost by effective marginal tax rates and  again, it’s only Labor who had the proposition out there in this tax debate to deal  with that problem.  Now, these are the real issues of tax reform, a fair thing as we  propose for those far too many skilled workers who find themselves in the upper  income bracket shouldn’t be there, get them out of that.  But a fair thing for the  seven million hardworking Australians in the middle and a decent outcome for the  poorest when they take on the opportunity to work.      

 JOURNALIST: Are you blocking the tax cut now, Kim? 

 

 BEAZLEY:  We are proposing a decent tax cut, that’s what we’re doing,  there’s nothing like a decent fight.  I said when I became Leader of the  Opposition that we’d hold this Government accountable and we’d sharpen the 

 distances between us.  We would not simply accept, at face value, what they  think is necessary for our people or our society and we have been presented  immediately with a desperately unfair tax package but because of its size would  crowd out government activity for a couple years.  $24 billion is not a small  amount off the Government bottom line, but we’ve got a better way of spending  that $24 billion.  Costello has not been able to lay a glove on our numbers so he  avoids the debate.   

 JOURNALIST: So then their tax plan is not in the best national interest?   

 BEAZLEY:  What I’ve said about the question of procedures they want  you all to focus on is that the Labor Party has always made clear, let’s ignore  what Costello says about it, let’s look at what we’ve said all along.  We say that  at no stage that we’d either vote for or against that disallowable instrument.  Our  quarrel is not with the Commissioner of Taxation.  When we do come to  considering that we will of course, as with all our votes, contemplate the issue of  the national interest.  But we will not consider, until we have had a chance in the  Parliament to hold up to this Government the fact that they are doing the wrong  thing by the fast majority of Australian taxpayers and we will deal with that issue  first.   

 JOURNALIST: You say you want a debate.  Will it be a lengthy debate?   

 BEAZLEY:  The Senate doesn’t debate at length, it’s a simple  proposition.  Labor says that the seven million who are getting $6 should get  double that.  Labor says that it’s a fair thing to take people up to $100,000 out of  the upper income bracket but that’s far enough.  We say it’s a fair thing that  people don’t pay 70 cents effective marginal tax rate down at the bottom end,  which is what they do.  So, we say, and it’s simple, there’s nothing complex  about those propositions, they can be debated very rapidly by the Senate. 

 

 JOURNALIST:  Ultimately,  at  the end of that fight, are you going to have to  pass these cuts?   

 BEAZLEY:  Don’t be so pessimistic.  There is just a possibility that they  may be sufficiently shamed either to do something about it now or never to do  this again, and we take one step at a time.  There’s going to be plenty of time to  handle all these issues, both the substantive issue, which is what we’re talking  about, here and the procedural issue which is what we’re talking about with the  disallowable instrument.  They can all be handled in the next fortnight. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Can I ask you a quick question about airports?  The plan that  was announced yesterday, do you think that is enough or is there more that  needs to be investigated?   

 BEAZLEY:  Why wasn’t it done four years ago?  The Americans did this  four years ago.  The Government let us believe, I think all of us Australians, that  they’d handled this and now we find they misled us.  What I said about John  Howard, marvellous spin, he’s had marvellous spin out there on national security,  inoculating the community to all sorts of concerns, keeping them relaxed and  comfortable and then we find out the truth.  And the truth is the agencies do not 

 sufficiently consult each other.  We have a shocking view wandering around  Customs of the affairs at Sydney Airport, for example, and the State Police and  the Federal Police know nothing about it.  This is just hopelessly inadequate and  this is a response that is four years too late.   

 JOURNALIST: You obviously do a fair bit of travel, are you worried about  the security of your bags?   

 BEAZLEY:  I’m a confident traveller because I do it so often and my  experience has always been good.  But there is no doubt that a lot of Australians  feel nervous about it and they feel nervous for many reasons.  They feel nervous  because of the circumstances that have been argued in Schapelle Corby’s case,  for example.  They feel nervous about that.  They feel nervous about, and that’s  shown in the way in which they handle their luggage, they should not be in that  position, they should have total confidence.  If this Government had been doing  its job they would have total confidence.   

 JOURNALIST: Does a British expert know more than what anyone in  Australia should know?  Why are they bringing in someone from overseas?   

 BEAZLEY:  He is a very good man and he has an international  reputation.  But I would have thought that if they left Mick Palmer doing the job as  Inspector (of Transport Security) instead of firstly appointing him too late, the 12  months they had the authority to appoint the Inspector before they appointed him  and then taking him immediately off it for an inquiry which, basically, however  good Mick might be, was basically aimed at covering the Government’s rear with  another political problem that they’re confronting and he has found that his  powers or his situation is adequate to handle all the inquiries they now have to  do.  So, Mick Palmer’s been left there in sort of limbo really, when really what we  should have been having was the benefit of his view for the last year or so and  then this would not be necessary.   

 Ends
