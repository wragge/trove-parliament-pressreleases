 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 19 February 2014   

 Immigration Department privacy breach makes  a mockery of the obsession with secrecy   

 The Australian Greens have called on the Immigration Minister to explain what he will do to  ensure that thousands of refugees who have had their private details published online will not  be negatively affected by the breach.   

 “This breach makes a mockery of the Government’s obsession with secrecy,” the Greens’  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Thousands of refugees have had their private details published online and the Government  must now take that into account when considering their claims for protection.   

 “This is a very serious breach of privacy and yet another example of this Government’s failure to  care for vulnerable people who are fleeing for their lives.   

 “The Immigration Minister must provide a full and frank explanation of how this breach  occurred and what will be done to protect the people involved.”
