 MEDIA RELEASE

 JOHN HOWARD’S PACIFIC SOLUTION: WHAT ABOUT THE FOREIGN POLICY COSTS?

 The Foreign Correspondent program aired on ABC Television last night raises some serious and fundamental questions about the foreign policy costs to Australia of the Pacific Solution in terms of our future relations with our South Pacific neighbours.

 First, it raises questions about the impact of the Howard Government’s Pacific Solution on Australia’s future relations with Papua New Guinea.  In the longer term, what effect will the hastily put together Pacific Solution and the way it was put upon the PNG Government have on our level of influence on matters of mutual interest?

 Second, the program raises questions about the extent to which Australian requirements associated with the Pacific Solution may have created questions of legality and constitutionality in PNG.  A court case is pending there on whether the PNG Government’s detention of asylum seekers is legal and constitutional.  What does this mean for the future of the PNG Government?

 The third question the program raises is what form of leverage did the Government apply on PNG to get it to agree to take the asylum seekers.  For that matter, what did the Government do to achieve a similar deal with Nauru?  And why is there so much secrecy surrounding these agreements?

 These are all important questions the Government will need to answer in the period ahead.

 Ends 18 April 2002
