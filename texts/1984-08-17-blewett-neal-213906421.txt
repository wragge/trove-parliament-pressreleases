 THE HON. NEAL BLEWETT

 Commonwealth Grants to N.S.W. Health Researchers

 The Minister for Health, Dr Neal Blewett, today  announced a grant of $23 018 for a study designed to  identify ways of improving ambulance care for cases of  severe injury such as those which result from motor  vehicle accidents.

 The grant, made to Dr Greg Goldstein, Lecturer in  Preventive and Social Medicine, of the Commonwealth Institute  of Health, Sydney was one of a number of grants totalling  $162 670 made to Australian health research workers under  the Health Services Research and Development Grants Scheme  administered by the Commonwealth Department of Health.

 The Minister said the study was important as it  could lead to improved methods for the initial treatment  of casualties when first attended to by ambulance personnel  and which could lead to the. saving of lives.

 Dr Blewett said few overseas studies of benefit  to Australia had been done and it was both timely and  appropriate for Australian health researchers to become  involved in this critical area of health care delivery.Â·

 The Minister also announced a grant of $34 229  to Dr Andrea Mant, the Director of the General Practice and  Primary Care Research Unit of the Royal Australian College  of General Practitioners, for a study into the long term  prescribing and use of psychotropic drugs (drugs effecting 

 the mind) in general practice.

 Dr Blewett said the study would help provide  information on prescribing patterns by general practitioners  of psychotropic drugs and could ultimately assist both patient  care and influence medical school curricula.
