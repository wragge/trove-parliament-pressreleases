 Senator the Hon Kay Patterson Minister for Health and Ageing

 Extra funding aims to lower tragic rate of suicide further

 November 28, 2002

 Increasing the self confidence of young people at risk of suicide, identifying others at risk through emergency departments and counselling for drug users are among 12 Victorian projects to get an extra $550,000 to help with suicide prevention in Victoria.

 The Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Kay Patterson, today approved the twelve projects as part of the Commonwealth Governments $66.4million National Suicide Prevention Strategy, which is working to reduce the incidence of suicide in Australia.

 "Suicide is a complex problem and accordingly any strategy needs to have a variety of approaches," she said. "This new funding will enable existing programs to extend their services working further to reduce the tragic incidence of suicide in Australia."

 In Victoria, funding through the Victorian Foundation for Survivors of Torture will assist young refugees and their families, many of whom have been affected by war and trauma, to cope with the stresses involved in adjusting to a new culture and schools system.

 In the Wimmera, another preventative project is helping young people in rural areas. This project is working closely with many youth organisations across the region and has already initiated a range of activities for young people including leadership training, camps, a youth forum for 700 participants, workshops in schools and a website. The extra funding will allow these youth projects to be expanded and train additional support staff in dealing with young people in crisis.

 A third project focuses on people who have gone to Emergency Departments in the Western Region of Melbourne after attempting suicide to receive appropriate support and treatment in the weeks following hospital attendance because it is during this time that they are at highest risk of attempting suicide again.

 The additional $550,000 provided today is an extension on the $3.4 million already allocated by the Commonwealth Government in Victoria as part of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy, a seven- year program which started in 1999.

 In 1997 in Victoria, 669 people took their lives; this compares to 511 in 2000. This is a 23% reduction, with the biggest decrease among young Australians.

 "While we are making inroads into the tragedy of suicide, the number of Australians taking their own lives is still significant. Men aged 25-44 years and people in rural areas are still at the greatest risk. But, through the extension of the National Suicide Prevention Program we hope to continue to build stronger community supports and further reduce these tragic statistics," said Minister Patterson.
