 LAURIE BRERETON MP SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

 HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN AFGHANISTAN

 The  Shadow  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Laurie  Brereton,  today  called  on  the  Howard Government to boost Australia’s response to the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.

 “UN and non-government aid agencies are now warning that Afghanistan could see the 21st century’s first great refugee disaster”, Mr Brereton said.

 “UN estimates of the number of displaced people in and around Afghanistan have jumped to more than 6 million, with the shadow of famine hanging over a vast number of people on the move towards Afghanistan’s borders.”

 “The UN High Commissioner for Refugees is appealing for $US252 million to cope with the flood of refugees into Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan’s northern neighbours.”

 “Any effective strategy to stop Afghanistan from being used as a terrorist haven must deal with the humanitarian crisis.”

 “UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair have rightly called for the formation of a humanitarian coalition to prevent a potential disaster.”

 “In  these  circumstances,  the  Howard  Government  should  urgently  re-evaluate  Australia’s contribution to emergency relief efforts.”

 On 6 September, Immigration Minister Ruddock announced that Australia would allocate an additional $AUD 14.3 million to support processing and assessment of displaced Afghani’s in South West Asia.  This contribution was made prior to the current humanitarian crisis.

 On 23 September, Foreign Minister Downer issued a press release announcing this $14.3 million contribution for a second time.  He made no reference to the fact that Mr Ruddock had already previously announced this commitment.

 “Re-announcing  an  existing  aid  commitment  is  not  a  genuine  response  to  this  unfolding tragedy”, Mr Brereton said.

 “Much  more  aid  will  be  required,  both  inside  and  outside  Afghanistan.   The  international community, including Australia, will have to make further large aid contributions.”

 “It  would  be  a  terrible  tragedy  if  the  international  campaign  against  terrorism  were  to proceed in the midst of a humanitarian disaster.”
