  PRIME MINISTER 

  ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER  THE HON JOHN HO\VARD MP  FEDERATION OF INDIAN ASSOCIATION'S DINNER FOR THE 51ST  ANNIVERSARY OF INDIAN INDEPENDENCE 

  HYATT HOTEL - MELBOURL~E 

  E&OE ............................................................................................... . 

  Dr Mara, to Mr Phil Honeywood, to His Excellency the High Commissioner in Australia  for the republic oflndia, Mrs Joy Howley, the President of the Victorian Division of the  Liberal Party, Mr Harry Jenkins, my other Federal and State parliamentary colleagues,  ladies and gentlemen. 

  I am particularly pleased to share this very special night with Australians of Indian  descent and Indian background. We gather tonight, partly in honour of the 51 st  anniversary of the independence ofindia, commemorating that tumultuous event on the  15th of August 1947 when the Indian sub-continent was partitioned into to new nations, 

  independent nations, oflndia and Pakistan. But more deeply we celebrate the links that  exist between our two countries. India is the world's biggest democracy. India and  Australia share many things in common. We have a rich history. We share in part a  common cultural heritage. Each of course has its own separate and distinct heritage, but  we share very much in common a facility with the language of English, essentially a  common system of jurisprudence and most importantly of all of course a common love of  that great game of cricket. â¢ 

  And I was reminded tonight that there are other things that we share in common. We  share in common the sacrifice of our sons and daughters in defence of liberty and defence  of freedom. Last Anzac day I had the privilege of journeying to Hellfire Pass in Thailand  to commemorate the heroic deeds of those Australian men who died in captivity building  the notorious Burma-Thailand railway. And of course it serves all Australians well to be  reminded that along with the Australians who died in those tragic circumstances, many  thousands of Indian servicemen also lost their lives, and \Vhen I spoke of the dedication 

  of the museum, I not only honoured the Australian dead but I also honoured the Indian  dead. 

  Australia's links with India of course go beyond those that I've mentioned. They~ .  very contemporary links, they are links of commerce, they are links of business, they are  links of trade and they are links of investment. The New Horizons project represented  one of the largest individual overseas trade efforts that Australia has ever mounted. And  I'm particularly pleased that it turned out to be so enormously successful in its  development. Of course the Indian community in Australia is one of its most long  established. There are now something like 160,000 Australians oflndian descent which  represents a very large number indeed and I want on behalf of the Government and on  behalf of all other Australians to pay respect to, and to thank the Australians of Indian  descent for the contribution that they have made to the development of our nation. The  contribution that they have made in all walks of life, in business, in the community  generally, in medicine, in law, in commerce, in sport and indeed in all the range of  activities of the Australian community. 

  And I also want to take the opportunity tonight to reaffirm the importance within the  Australian community of those enduring values, those enduring Australian values of  tolerance and harmony. Australia is the most successful demonstration of racial harmony  that can be found anywhere in the world. We sometimes sell short the achievement that  Australia represents as we move towards the third millennium. We sometimes forget that  we have successfully absorbed people from 140 nations on earth. We sometimes forget 

  that although on occasions we have difficulty and intolerance and bigotry and racism  demonstrated within our community, that overall we have been more successful than any  other country. Australia, be it remembered, took more Indo-Chinese refugees in the late  1970s on a per capita basis than any nation on earth, and remember that we have  demonstrated a capacity for tolerance and understanding and ham10ny which is quite  unparalleled, and something of which Australians should always be defiantly proud. And 

  I for one, as Prime Minister, and I know that the overwhelming bulk of the Australian  community are proud of the tolerance that we have demonstrated, proud of our capacity  to harmonise, to absorb, but to respect cultural difference. We are all united by a  common lo.¥e of Australia, but a common love of Australian values, by a common love of  what Australia can be in the future. But consistent with that we respect the right of all to  preserve their own particular cultural values, and their own particular heritage. 

  Yesterday, Philip Ruddock on behalf of the Government launched the 'Living in  Harmony' campaign. Some will call it an anti-racism campaign, some will call it a pro- â¢  tolerance campaign, some will call it, I think quite properly, a re-affirmation of some  enduring Australian values. And that campaign is designed to demonstrate by example  the positive aspects of Australian life, to demonstrate the success stories of diversity, to  demonstrate that we can learn from each other and we can absorb the values of each other  and produce common values out of that absorption, which are important to all of us and 

  to remind all of us that the things that unite Australians are always greater and more  cnJmi11g than the things that divide us.

  India and Australia belong to a great democratic tradition. My own first visit to India  occurred in 1964. I remember it very well. I spent two weeks there on the way to  Europe, and having not long come out of the Sydney University law school, I not  surprisingly wandered along to a sitting of the Indian Supreme Court in New Delhi ~dl  sat there and listened to a complicated constitutional case being argued about the  respective roles of the Federal and State Governments within India. I've often thought of  that case when I've been at Premiers Conferences. And what struck me then, way back 

  34 years ago, was the extraordinary heritage that we shared in common, because one of  the cases quoted during the complicated argument was a decision of the High Court of  Australia dealing with the respective powers of the Commonwealth and State  Governments within the Australian federation. And that was a very practical reminder to  me all those years ago of the many things that our two countries have in common. But 

  the most important thing we have in common is of course a common love of democracy.  And it is quite remarkable, given the size oflndia, given the ethnic differences, the  religious differences, the historical differences, and the struggle that India has had with  poverty, and all the other challenges that India has had. It is quite a remarkable thing that 

  democracy has survived and it is an enormous tribute to the Indian people that democracy  has survived, given all of that adversity. And anybody who has studied the history of  India can't help but be moved by the tragedy that has overtaken that country and the  leadership of that country on so many occasions. 

  I always find it difficult as a Prime Minister, to reflect upon the fact that some of the  people that I've met occupying the positions of Prime Minister and President of other  countries, after I've met them, have died in violent circumstances or through political  assassination, and it is a reminder to us of what a triumph of the human spirit it is that a  country should have survived all of that and still retained a deep and abiding faith in the  democratic process, and it is also of course a reminder of the immense privilege we have  of living in this country in relative tranquillity and harmony and peace and how it is 

  incumbent on all of us to play our part in preserving tolerance, in exterminating  discrimination and bigotry and intolerance and maintaining the great Australian values  that bind us all together. 

  I wanted to end my remarks tonight by referring to a moving illustration that some of you  may be aware ofI'm sure, of the modem links between our two countries, and of course  it concerns Mr Satish Gujral who'd be well-known to you as one oflndia's outstanding  contemporary artists, architects and poets. And his family is part of the story of modem 

  India- his father was a friend of Nehru and of Gandhi, and of Jinnah. Now 72, he's been  deaf for more than 60 years following a childhood injury. But in mid-June in the Mater  Hospital in Sydney, Professor Bill Gibson, the developer of the Australian technology  implanted a cochlear bionic ear into Mr Gujral's inner ear, and he was not only Professor  Gibson's oldest patient to receive the implant, he was also one of those who'd been the 

  longest without the sensation of hearing. But within a month of this remarkable operation  performed by a skilled Australian surgeon, he could hear his own voice, he heard his  \\·ife's voice for the first time ever, and he now hears birds and the sound of running  \'- ater. And as his way of saying thanks, he gave a highly successful exhibition of his 

  recent paintings and sculpture and that \Vas launched recently by the New South Wales

  Opposition·leader Peter Collins, and it was very warmly supported by His Excellency the  High Commissioner who is here tonight and his staff Satish Gujral is a friend of  Australia whose experience in this country has changed his world and in turn we have  gained from his coming. And as always in the links that exist between nations, andthe  bonds that bind nations together, it is the moving personal and human stories that 

  exemplify most of all what those bonds mean, and that is a wonderful story of the way in  which the skill of an Australian surgeon has brought joy and happiness and contentment  to a distinguished Indian in a way that ennobles both of them and I think says volumes for  the basic decency and harmony and affection that exists between the peoples of our two  countries. 

  Thank you.
