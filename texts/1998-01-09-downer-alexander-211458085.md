I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government is contributing a
further $ 1 million in humanitarian relief to Burmese refugees residing in
camps on the Thailand-Burma border. The funds are being provided through
AusAID's humanitarian relief program.

 The Australian Government
is conscious of the burdens placed on Thailand by this refugee presence, and
we are prepared to do what we can to help share the burden of refugee
relief. Australia encourages Thailand to continue to provide sanctuary to
civilian refugees from Burma so long as it is unsafe for them to return to
Burma. We also encourage Burma's Government - the State Peace and
Development Council - to take steps to improve the observance of human
rights inside Burma, which is the underlying cause of the problem.

 The aid is for over 115,000 refugees composed of largely the Karen
ethnic minority but also the Mon and Karenni peoples. Australian funds will
provide food, mosquito nets, firewood, blankets and basic health care. The
assistance is designed to promote self-sufficiency and assist the refugees
in establishing their own health system. The relief programs will be
implemented in partnership with Australian NGOs.

 $650,000 is
going to the National Council of Churches in Australia (NCCA) as part of
their work with the Burmese Border Consortium (BBC) which currently provide
all the food and relief assistance to the refugees. A further $350,000 has
been allocated to Community Aid Abroad (Oxfam in Australia) to provide
medical assistance to reduce the spread of communicable diseases and improve
sanitation. These activities include malaria control, immunisation, and the
development of adequate sanitation facilities to reduce the prevalence of
disease in the camps.
