 MACPHEE CRITICAL OF HAYDEN

 From the Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs. THE HON..IAN MACPHEE, M.P.

 "The Leader of the Opposition," Mr Hayden, was making a fool  of himself" the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee said today. Mr Macphee was commenting on  recent statements on immigration attributed to the Leader  of the;Opposition.

 "The last time Mr Hayden addressed himself to migration . issues was 15 months ago" the Minister said.

 In;June 1980 Mr Hayden undertook to issue major policy  statements in the ensuing months on the following:-* criteria for migrant entry;

 * post-arrival services and facilities;

 * Labor's philosophy ;in the years to come in .  the "area of Immigration and‘Ethnic Affairs.

 "Mr Hayden seems to have forgotten that he gave these  undertakings."' Mr Macphee said, "everyone is still waitding  for these, statements.  " ,/z

 "In a situation where Mr Hayden has failed to offer  alternatives how can he be taken seriously" the'Minister  said. "While he is touching upon some of the issues he  offers no solutions.".

 "Last year I suggested that the Government and Opposition  work towards a bipartisan policy on immigration. This  suggestion was applauded by community groups concerned with  migrant settlement". -

 "When Mr Young became Opposition spokesman for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs I renewed that suggestion and his:immediate  acceptance was enthusiastically welcomed by all ethnic and  community organisatiohs." Mr Macphee said.

 "As part of the review of NUMAS Mr Young and I travelled .  throughout Australia together listening to the views of  migrant groups and I believe we share an,understanding of the  complexities involved in formulating Australia's immigration 

 policy for the balance of this century."

 "As soon as Mr Young goes overseas Mr Hayden has jettisoned  those months of careful preparation and has now told Parliament  that he is doubtful of our capacity to achieve a bipartisan  policy," Mr Macphee said. "Instead he has embarked upon political  point scoring without any understanding of the subject matter."

 "With his utterances on refugees Mr Hayden has played into the  hands of those who would wish to exclude Asian migrants from  Australia," Mr Macphee said. "Would he also say the same about  persons from Poland and other Eastern European countries?"

 Is Mr Hayden asking that Vietnamese boat people be sent back? Is Mr Hayden asking that non political refugees be kept in  camps in Malaysia or Thailand? Is he suggesting that the boats  "should be pushed off?"

 "All concerned Governments are aware of the problem. Unlike  Mr Hayden they are looking for solutions".
