 Senator Aden Ridgeway  Australian Democrat Senator for NSW    

 13 December 2003              STATEMENT                         03/890 

 

 Howard Must Apply His Family Values to Refugee Families Too   

 I am behind barbed wire today to highlight the shameful policy of separating families that this  Government justifies under the term ‘border protection’.   

 Currently in Nauru, there are six women and their children who remain separated from their  husbands. Their husbands have been granted TPVs and live in Australia; they have not seen their  wives and children for two years.   

 The bureaucratic justification for this human tragedy is that they arrived on different boats. Now the  Government wants to send the women and children back to Afghanistan; a place recently described  by the United Nations as being on the brink of chaos and internal collapse yet again.   

 Democrats Leader and Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, has visited every  Federal detention centre inside Australia and overseas.   

 After visiting Nauru in July, he described the distressing sight of taxpayer-funded imprisonment of  children.   

 Lives are destroyed, children’s futures are stolen and the Government boasts of this as a success.   

 No doubt Governments in the past also spoke in similar glowing tones of the policy of separating  Australian Indigenous children from their families.   

 To add to our shame, the New Zealand Government recently accepted three families in a similar  situation - including the men - as permanent residents; a truly humanitarian and practical outcome.   

 The Australian Democrats have consistently advocated  â¢ permanent protection for refugees  â¢ full access for asylum seekers to Australian legal institutions  â¢ full access for refugees to welfare, education and legal systems 

 â¢ Australian immigration law to meet our International obligations.   

 We call on the Federal Government to reunite these families now and release all children from  detention centres.   

 Senator Ridgeway took part in Amnesty International’s “Daybreak in Detention” Event at  Bondi Park today.
