 Australian Democrats Press Releases

 Senator Andrew Bartlett  Deputy Parliamentary Leader and Democrats Senator for  Queensland  Australian Democrats spokesperson for Immigration and  Multicultural Affairs

 Dated: 15 March 2006 

 Press Release Number: hdtpcgiy  Portfolio: Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

 Refugees And DIMA - Where To From Here? 

 Democrats' Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett said today that additional measures  were needed to reform Australia's grossly inadequate and unfair immigration system.   

 "While we have recently seen baby steps addressing the cultural deficiencies within DIMA, much of it  has largely been cosmetic, while the Minister has been vested with an inordinate amount of power as a  backup or failsafe."   

 "While I don't dispute the need for Ministerial Discretion as a last measure, we need real reform if we are  to see any fundamental improvements to the system."   

 "Many migrants, as well as refugees and asylums seekers have suffered disproportionately under this  system which has failed to have adequate checks and balances built into the system to protect their  fundamental human rights."   

 "The newly tabled Senate Committee report into the administration and operation of the Migration Act  has found that part of the problem we see today stems from the innate unfairness and restrictions on  due process contained in the law itself. The unnecessary complexity of deciphering the Migration Act  and the lack of a system of complementary protection all create unnecessary confusion, inefficiency and  unfairness."   

 "We urge the Government to implement the key recommendations of the report as well as those outlined  by the Democrats in our additional remarks, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Auditor-General and  others who pointed out multiple flaws with the existing system."   

 "This is the only way forward if the Government is serious about affecting real change in the way that  DIMA operates under the Act and wants to ensure that everyone who comes here gets a fair deal,"  Senator Bartlett concluded.   

 Senator Andrew Bartlett will be participating tonight in the South Australian Democrats Refugee Rights  Forum, Where to From Here?   Venue: Parliament House, North Terrace   When: Tonight, 5.00 pm for 5.15 pm.
