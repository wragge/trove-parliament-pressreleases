 Media Centre  Labor Claims About Adult Migrant English Programme  Wrong 

 3 September 2006 

 Labor claims that $11 million has been cut from a fully funded English  language course for migrants and refugees are wrong, the Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Andrew 

 Robb, said today. 

 Since taking office in 1996, the Government has ensured that no eligible  client is denied access to their entitlement of 510 hours of English tuition  under the Adult Migrant English Programme (AMEP). 

 The Government has put significant extra resources into the programme.  In fact the government increased funding by $36.8 million in 2004 to cater  for young humanitarian entrants with special needs. 

 Mr Robb said the government adjusted funding for the AMEP each year,  based on demand estimates. Last year’s spend was $139 million. This  year, the appropriation has gone up to $153.7 million based on estimates  of the amount of people requiring intensive programs. 

 Mr Rudd claimed today on ABC television that the AMEP’s budget had  been reduced by $11 million. This is wrong. 

 “Unfortunately, in running this red herring, Mr Rudd avoided the question  which asked did he support the Prime Minister’s observation that new  migrants should embrace Australian values, accept our culture and learn  English.” Mr Robb said. 

 “The Government regards English as a priority for migrants and refugees  and is committed to providing to those who need it, tuition and the tools  necessary for a working knowledge of Australia’s national language. 

 “The Government is focussed on helping new migrants integrate quickly  into the community. A functional level of English is fundamental to this  objective.”
