  Increased funding to help migrants settle into a ‘new life’ in Australia 

  The Federal Government has reinforced its long-standing commitment to the settlement of  migrants, refugees and humanitarian entrants, by announcing an additional $1 6.02m in  funding for the Community Settlement Services Scheme (CSSS). 

  Announcing the funding today, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary  Hardgrave, said the money would facilitate a smoother introduction into the community for  new migrants, refugees and humanitarian entrants settling in Australia. 

  “$16.02m will be offered to 148 organisations under the Community Settlement Services  Scheme (CSSS), to provide a range of settlement services in metropolitan, regional and  remote areas over three years,” Mr Hardgrave said. 

  “Settlement services assist refugees, humanitarian entrants and migrants to adjust to life in  Australia, to access available mainstream and specialist services and to achieve  independence and participation in Australian society. 

  “The grants I have announced today complement funding allocated in June for Migrant  Resource Centres and Migrant Service Agencies, the total funding for community services  now stands at $26.98m.” 

  “There had been great interest in the CSSS and competition for funding was very strong.  Of the 312 applications received, 187 grants are being funded this year, “ Mr Hargrave  said. 

  In total 102 projects received funding for one year, 56 received funding for two years and 29  received funding for three years. 

  Funding Advisory Committees (FACs) consisting of representatives from states, territories  and Federal Government agencies, identified proposed projects most appropriate for  funding and ensured existing services would not be duplicated.
