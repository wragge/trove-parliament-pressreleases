 Senator Andrew Bartlett   Leader of the Australian Democrats     September 4, 2003                   MEDIA RELEASE                          03/635                  

 

 Democrats Seek to Prevent Latest Government attack on  Refugees    

 The Australian Democrats will move to disallow new Government attempts to further erode the  permanent protection Australia provides to asylum seekers and their families.   

 Democrats’ Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said new laws introduced by the Government will  only give temporary visas to refugees who seek protection while in Australia. This will prevent  legitimate refugees getting permanent protection and prevent them from bringing their families to  safety in Australia.   

 “Deliberately seeking to split families and prevent people seeking safety together in Australia is  heartless in the extreme,” Senator Bartlett said.   

 “Since the Government first introduced temporary protection visas in 1999, there is clear evidence  that this has led to massive trauma and distress for refugees.  It prevents them from rebuilding their  lives and contributing fully to the Australian community.   

 “Now the Government is creating a whole new class of people that it can leave high and dry,  without rights and without hope.  These are people who have not arrived illegally, who have not  tried to jump the queue, but who have sought a new life and been deemed legitimate refugees.   

 “The continued attack on refugees by this Government is sickening and diminishes us all.  The  Howard Government continually refuses to see asylum seekers as real people with real families,  instead seeking to demonise them so they can try and score political points.   

 “At a time when asylum seekers captured aboard the Tampa have finally arrived in Australia - after  more than a year of being held in limbo in detention camps on Nauru - the Government seeks to  erode the meagre rights refugees currently cling to.   

 “The actions of this Government show a determination to strip back every right and every hope of  refugees that flee atrocities in their homeland and make often treacherous trips to reach safety in  Australia.   

 “The lengths to which this Government will go to break these people and to keep children locked  behind razor wire - all with the aim of pushing their divisive political agenda and strategy of  creating fear in the community - is atrocious.   

 “We will use every avenue possible to stop this Government’s attack on the basic humanity of  refugees, including disallowing this coldhearted regulation.”
