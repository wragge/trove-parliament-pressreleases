 MEDIA RELEASE   

 095.12 20 October 2012 

 

 Four more boat arrivals returned to Sri Lanka   

 The Department of Immigration and Citizenship said today four more Sri  Lankan men were returning home voluntarily from Nauru after choosing not to  pursue their asylum claims.    

 This brings the total number of Sri Lankans to return home in 2012 to 79,  including 47 since the department began transferring people to Nauru as part  of the new regional processing arrangements.    

 “These individuals have chosen not to pursue asylum claims and therefore are  no longer seeking to engage Australia’s protection obligations,” a  departmental spokesman said.    

 “The men were in the post-13 August cohort and so were subject to transfer to  a regional processing centre - they have instead chosen to return home  voluntarily.”    

 The spokesman said transfers of boat arrivals to Nauru continued this week  and more would follow in the coming days and weeks.    

 “Regular transfers to Nauru and more Sri Lankans returning home is further  proof that there is no advantage engaging with people smugglers,” the  spokesman said.    

 People in immigration detention can request their removal from Australia at  any point in time. Those who choose to depart voluntarily can be provided  with individual reintegration support to assist with their sustainable return,  through the International Organization for Migration.    

 Reintegration packages are determined on a case-by-case basis depending  on need and eligibility.
