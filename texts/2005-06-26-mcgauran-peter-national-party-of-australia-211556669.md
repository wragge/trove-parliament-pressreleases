 Citizenship For 48 Refugees

 26 June 2005

 Forty-eight refugees will celebrate World Refugee Day by becoming Australian citizens at a special ceremony held at the  Western Bulldogs Football Club today.

 The Australian Government Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Peter McGauran, said the conferees were  refugees who have built new lives in Australia.

 ‘Our newest citizens have come from Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan. I am delighted they are taking the  final step in becoming full participants in the Australian community,’ Minister McGauran said.

 ‘The theme for World Refugee Day 2005 is Courage and this citizenship ceremony is a celebration of the spirit, courage  and determination that characterises humanitarian entrants. 

 ‘Australia has one of the largest dedicated refugee and humanitarian resettlement programs in the world. In the past year  Victoria has welcomed 3528 arrivals under the Refugee and Special Humanitarian programs,’ Minister McGauran said.

 ‘Citizenship is the unifying force in our culturally diverse society. I encourage all those who are eligible to apply for  Australian citizenship.’

 Players and staff of the Western Bulldogs will be present at the ceremony.

 Citizenship information is available at www.citizenship.gov.au or from the Citizenship Information Line on 131 880.
