 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION   MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 DUTTON’S INACTION A DISGRACE 

 

 Figures from Peter Dutton’s own department have revealed an alarming blow out in  the time asylum seekers are spending in detention facilities in Australia.   

 According to the statistics released by the Department of Immigration and Border  Protection, asylum seekers are now facing an average of 445 days in detention.  This is more than double the processing time under Labor.   

 Allowing men, women and children to languish indefinitely in detention is a disgrace  and Peter Dutton needs to immediately start taking responsibility for the dysfunction  he is overseeing.   

 There is no excuse for the processing time of asylum seekers to be increasing, yet  that is exactly what has happened since the Abbott-Turnbull Government came to  office.   

 This is yet another sad example of Peter Dutton’s failure as a Minister.
