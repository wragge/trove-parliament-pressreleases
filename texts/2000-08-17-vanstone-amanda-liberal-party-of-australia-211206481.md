 Boat people intercepted near Ashmore Islands A vessel carrying about 70 boat people was intercepted this morning near Ashmore Islands off north-western Australia, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today.

 The motorised Indonesian fishing vessel was intercepted by the Customs vessel Roebuck Bay which is patrolling the area on a tasking from Customs Coastwatch.

 First reports indicate the people, believed to be of Middle Eastern origin, are in good health.

 Senator Vanstone said Coastwatch was making arrangements to transport the people to the mainland, where they would be handed to officials from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.

  

 NOTE: Exact passenger numbers will not be available until the vessel is anchored at Ashmore Islands.
