 BEAZLEY: There'll be many issues you'll want to raise with me today but I think, in many ways, one of the most significant stories of the day is a very small one but with very big implications; and that is the ABS statistics which reveal us doing the world's worst performance on investment in research and development. The nations which succeed this century will be those who invest in innovative ideas, skill their people, and ensure that they maintain their scientific endeavour at peak performance. And we are failing on all fronts. And it's got far worse since John Howard was in office. He has sacrificed the future of this nation for a short-term political benefit. And we've got to change on it or we will be a sad bunch of Australians by the end of this century.

 JOURNALIST: Do you think Labor's plan to boost research scholarships would address that problem? Would that go far enough?

 BEAZLEY: No, it would start it. Labor's plan would start the process. And I notice that the Chief Scientist has indicated that in his recommendations. It's not all that should be done but it is an essential start - boosting the scholarships, or research fellowships, in the areas where they already exist. But coming in on top of that a scheme to encourage the return to Australia and the retention within Australia of our top scientists and researchers. These are necessary starts, but by no means all that should be done.

 JOURNALIST: You'd have heard, this morning, Coalition MPs calling for an increase in road funding linked to excise. What do you think about that?

 BEAZLEY: Well, we've always opposed hypothecation of excise, always opposed that, because, of course, it pays, that fuel excise pays for a whole range of government activities. But what the Coalition MPs admitted was that there's a windfall. And Howard and Costello were in total denial on that windfall yesterday. And what we say is that windfall should be used to uphold Mr Howard's promises on petrol tax, which he has broken. He now has confirmed by his Coalition bankbenchers that that windfall exists. The cat's out of the bag and he's got to keep his promises.

 JOURNALIST: So, would you rather see a reduction in excise than a boost in road spending?

 BEAZLEY: I would rather see that they spent their windfall on keeping their promises.

 JOURNALIST: Do you think, in fact, that the next election, when it comes to winning seats in the bush, though, you would have to almost be equal in whatever the Coalition promises to spend on roads?

 BEAZLEY: Look, what the Coalition has done on roads, of course, is reduce spending. That's what

 they've done on roads. They have also appallingly neglected the bush. Yesterday, we saw Costello in the Parliament asked two questions on the impact of petrol prices in regional Australia and he obtusely refused to acknowledge that regional Australia existed. He went through his usual exercise of reading out a list of what's happened in capital cities. And when we got up and made the point to him again, again he refused to address the position of regional Australia. As far as this Government is concerned, at its very peak, they do not admit that regional Australia exists. So, we will be competitive with our opponents in regional Australia, you bet, because, frankly, none of their programs are believable, none of their promises are believable, so folk go for attitudes. And they know that this Coalition Government long since departed any empathy or sympathy with them.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, are you comfortable with Stephen Conroy accepting an Olympic ticket package?

 BEAZLEY: I've made clear our views on the issue of Olympic tickets and I've made those views clear again to my Shadow Cabinet colleagues over the course of the last couple of days, and I'm sure that they will heed it.

 JOURNALIST: Does that mean no, because he has accepted a three-day package?

 BEAZLEY: It means exactly what I said it meant.

 JOURNALIST: Is the uprising at Woomera a reflection of the Government's policies towards illegal immigrants?

 BEAZLEY: The uprising at Woomera is to be totally condemned. The processes have been gone through for those who are applying for refugee status in this country. This is a country with a generous attitude towards refugees. The behaviour there is absolutely unacceptable, absolutely unacceptable, and we assume that it will all be appropriately investigated. And where criminal activities have taken place, charges will be laid.

 JOURNALIST: The industry-wide strikes begin today. Andrew Murray has accused Labor of being indistinguishable from the unions?

 BEAZLEY: Well, these industry-wide strikes are another triumph for Peter Reith. This is a direct product of his Act which, effectively, prevents bargaining during the course of an agreement, and loading all the industrial argument at the end of an agreement period. And it just so happens that through manufacturing industry the agreements all come up at the same time. So, they can thank Peter Reith's inflexibilities for the situation in which they now find themselves. And they can thank Peter Reith's Act, which limits the capacities of the IRC to act in public benefit terms and to act as an honest broker, and that virtually oblige employers and employees to go to the mattresses whenever there is an industrial dispute of any substance between them.

 JOURNALIST: ...$30 million...

 BEAZLEY: $30 million - Peter Reith's bill.

 JOURNALIST: Where are you up to with negotiations on Queensland native title?

 BEAZLEY: Well, we understand that there's correspondence passing between QIWG and the Queensland Government. We think it would be courteous to wait till that process had concluded, and

 when it has we would finalise our position. We take the view on this that the positions that we'll adopt will uphold the principled stands that we've taken on these issues over the years, and that we will be there supportive of the Aborigines position on a right to negotiate. But we also say that it's possible to put in place State-based regimes and we don't have any in-principle objection to that occurring. But we will not finalise our position until that process of discussion is complete.

 JOURNALIST: The disallowance motion is tomorrow so...

 BEAZLEY: Yes, that's right.

 JOURNALIST: Which way are you looking at going?

 BEAZLEY: Negotiations often go down to the wire, that's right.

 JOURNALIST: Are you taking your position to Caucus today?

 BEAZLEY: What I take to Caucus is for the business of Caucus, not for anyone else. Naturally, I suspect, there'll be discussion on it in Caucus today.

 JOURNALIST: Have you spoken to the Democrats about their inquiry proposal and would you expect â€¦ what inquiry they would like to see in the Senate?

 BEAZLEY: The Democrats are running away from the issue which concerns all Australians - and that's the price of petrol. They will look at anything but that and, frankly, they owe it to the Australian people to ensure that an inquiry takes place on the broken promise on petrol. And Meg Lees effectively acknowledged today that there was a broken promise, but said that that was historical. It's not historical, it's occurred in the course of the last couple of months. There is a windfall there now, as the National Party and Liberal Party backbenchers have acknowledged, and there is an opportunity to use that windfall to keep that promise.

 JOURNALIST: You've got to get together, though, to get an inquiry off the ground, don't you?

 BEAZLEY: Well, at the end of the day, if the Democrats don't support our inquiry it doesn't get off the ground. But I don't think they'd feel very good about it if they didn't.

 JOURNALIST: Do you agree with Stephen Conroy accepting that Olympic ticket package?

 BEAZLEY: I've already answered that question and I don't...

 JOURNALIST: What's your position on the bastardisation committee hearings yesterday within the Defence Forces?

 BEAZLEY: Oh, sorry, mate, I'm not up to speed on that.

 JOURNALIST: And the Defence legislation, that'll be going through..?

 BEAZLEY: On the Defence legislation? We've put forward a series of amendments which meet most reasonable concerns that have been raised by the States and by other parties concerned in the area of potential breaches of civil liberties. I hope the Government accepts them. Thanks.
