 AA  07  03          25  January  2007  

 

 Australia provides $5 million for post-conflict activities in Lebanon    

 I  am  pleased  to  announce  $5  million  for  new  reconstruction  and  development  activities  in   Lebanon.   

 The commitment, to several international agencies working to help the country recover from  last year’s conflict, is expected to benefit tens of thousands of people.   

 Our  contribution  of  $1.5  million  will  assist  the  World  Health  Organization  in  its work  with  Lebanon’s  Ministry  of  Health  on  reconstruction  of  priority  health  infrastructure  such  as   hospitals and clinics. 

 

 The $1.5 million provided to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) will support the  restoration of health services, particularly immunisation campaigns for children.   

 Australia  will  provide  $1  million  to  the  UN  Relief  and  Works  Agency  to  help  reconstruct   health facilities in Palestinian refugee camps.   

 And we will provide $1 million to the UN Mine Action Service for clearance of unexploded  ordnance and to provide support to survivors.    

 The UN estimates last year’s conflict left one million explosive remnants of war in Lebanon.   

 As  well  as  endangering  lives,  these  have  made  large  tracts  of  land  inaccessible  for  crop   harvesting.   

 Australia is a global leader in mine clearance activities and is already funding activities in this  area in Lebanon.    

 Australia will participate in this week’s Lebanon donor support conference in Paris, and has  committed up to $24 million to Lebanon for reconstruction since the conflict last year.
