  MEDIA RELEASE  Tony Abbott MHR  Federal Member for Warrinaah ~ ~~  15 December 2004 ABB 194/04 

  DAY OF DIFFERENCE FUNDING 

  The Member for Warringah, Tony Abbott, announced today that the Australian Government  would provide Manly Council with $20,000 to support a community "Day of Difference". 

  Mr Abbott said the grant supports the work of Ron Delezio, the father of Sophie Delezio,  who was badly burned in the Roundhouse childcare centre accident last December. 

  The Day of Difference recognises the diversity of the Australian community. "Australia is at  its best when everyone is recognised as part of the same team", Mr Abbott said. 

  Mr Abbott said the grant would fimd a report to the Mayor, aimed at identifying any gaps in  the Council's services to people at risk of being marginalised in the community. 

  "Manly Council faces many challenges providing a range of services to people from diverse  backgrounds with specific needs, including refugees, newly arrived migrants, people with  disabilities and the aged", Mr Abbott said. 

  "The proposed "Day of Difference" and related activities will help identify and meet the  needs of these people".
