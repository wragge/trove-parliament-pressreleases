 â¢ K119 arrives as taxpayers face massive 

 boat bill   07/05/10  

 The arrival of boat K119, just days before the Federal Budget, yet again highlights the  massive bill taxpayers will face for Kevin Rudd’s failed immigration and border  protection policies, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison  and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan  said today. 

 “Boats are arriving almost every day and every day the cost to Australians of Labor’s  ongoing border and immigration incompetence is spiralling up,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “Next week Kevin Rudd must come clean on the full cost of his failed border  protection policies, both on Christmas Island and at detention centres and motels all  around the mainland,” he said. 

 “Each extra person arriving at Christmas Island is costing taxpayers almost $82,000,  the government is running a virtual airline from the island to the mainland, onshore  detention facilities are filling up and old centres are being re-opened. Australians are  wearing the cost of this failure in the millions. 

 “Figures from Senate Estimates earlier this year revealed that when the Rudd  Government prepared the 2009/10 budget they believed only 200 people would arrive.  In November last year Minister Evans asked for an additional $134 million to cover  the cost of 1,400 arrivals. 

 “Now with a record 4,401 people arriving illegally by boat this financial year,  Australians can look forward to potentially another $200 million for asylum seeker  management. 

 “Kevin Rudd is happy for Australians to literally keep paying for his continued  failure,” he said. 

 Mr Keenan said: “This latest arrival, intercepted only a stone’s throw from the  Kimberley, reminds us just how exposed WA’s Northwest coast has become under  the Rudd Labor Government. 

 “Today’s interception has once again demonstrated the crippling condition of  Australia’s border protection system, and the high rate at which boats are arriving. 

 “Another day, another boat - this is what we’ve come to expect under the Rudd Labor  Government,” he said.
