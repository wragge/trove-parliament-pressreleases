 SENATOR THE HON KATE LUNDY  Minister for Sport, Minister for Multicultural Affairs, Minister  Assisting for Industry and Innovation   

 Speech at the Urban Development Institute of Australia National  Congress on Housing, Population, and Growth  Melbourne   Wednesday 6 March 2013   

 CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS OMITTED   

 I’d like to thank the organisers from the Urban Development Institute of Australia  for giving me the opportunity to speak at this event.  My presentation today will focus on population through our shared history of  migration and the contemporary trends and challenges of sustaining a managed  and strategic migration program. This has led to enormous benefits for Australia,  culturally, socially and economically.    

 AUSTRALIAN MIGRATION HISTORY  It’s a great pleasure to be with you here today in Melbourne, a city with a long  and proud history of welcoming new migrants.  With respect to our first Australians, the traditional custodians of this land,  Australia is a nation built on migration.  There is also no mistaking the effect of migration on our population.  We have  transformed from a predominately anglo-celtic population of 4.5 million to a  population of more than 22 million people who speak over 400 languages and  identify with more than 270 ancestries.   

 At the time of the last Census almost a third of Melbourne’s population was born  overseas, and nation-wide more than a quarter of us had a parent who migrated.    This means that most of us have a direct migrant connection.    To get an appreciation of these impacts from a population perspective let’s take  the last ten years as a baseline example.  Between the 2001 and 2011 Census we have seen just under two million people  added to Australia’s eight capital cities.  Some 1.4 million of these people were  new migrants - people who arrived since 2001.  This means that international migration has accounted for 70 per cent of total  capital city growth over this period, far outstripping any population increases from  internal migration or natural increase.  

 Looked at another way that 70 per cent migrant share is equivalent to adding  another Adelaide and another Hobart to our urban population every decade.  Economics has been and continues to be inextricably interlinked with migration  -  whether it be push or pull factors that have influenced  people to come here and  call Australia home - the Australian economy has reflected the waves of  migration that we have experienced.  In the last one hundred years Australia has experienced multiple waves of  migration.   From the convict settlement in the late 1700s and the settlement of free migrants  due to the growth of the wool industry and demands for labour.  To the discovery of gold by John Dunlop and his mate James Reagan in Ballarat  in Victoria, which triggered our first mining boom - seeing tens of thousands of  diggers from all walks of life and every corner of the world get off at Victoria Dock  to seek their fortunes in the goldfields - heralding four decades of prosperity for  Melbourne.    Transforming Melbourne from a remote colonial outpost of just 20,000 souls to a  vibrant financial and industrial centre, that was home to half a million inhabitants.  Australia also welcomed  ï· the Afghan, Pakistani and Turkish camel handlers who facilitated the 

 construction of the overland telegraph and railways lines across central  Australia;   ï· the Japanese fishers and Filipino Divers who were instrumental in facilitating  the pearling industry in Australia, the Greek settlers who worked in the mining 

 camps, on the wharves or on coastal ships in the 1850s;   ï· the Italian labourers and craftsmen who helped in the building of Melbourne  and fruiterers and cane-cutters in New South Wales, north Queensland; and   ï· firewood contractors working on the Woodline tramway in Western Australia 

 and labourers from Melanesia recruited to work on Queensland plantations.   

 Australia then welcomed the next great phase of migration less than a lifetime  ago with the welcoming of hundreds of thousands of migrants displaced and  fleeing the economic and political uncertainty of post-war Europe.   These ‘new Australians’ as they were known, settled down in suburbia, raised a  new generation of Australians and through their enterprise and hard work helped  fuel the economic boom of the 1950s and 1960s.  Following World War II, Australia’s refugee intakes focused on refugees fleeing  persecution and dictatorships from Asia including Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand,  Indonesia and Malaysia, and then Bosnian, Croatina and Serbian refugees  following the Yugoslav wars.  The emphasis on family migration, then student migration and finally skilled  migration saw more Chinese and Indian migrants making Australia their home,  as well as in the present day humanitarian migrants and refugees from Iraq,  Afghanistan, Africa and Sri Lanka being granted residency in Australia as a result  of overseas conflicts.   

 MIGRATION AND CULTURE 

 Combined with our rich indigenous heritage, the diversity of our people following  these different waves of migration continues to shape our identity, socially and  economically as a rich and vibrant multicultural nation.   While migration numbers waxed and waned for much of the ensuing period, the  ethnic diversity of Australia’s migrant population continued to grow.  And this growth, this city - and indeed the rest of the country - became a much  more interesting place to live.   Introducing Melbournians raised on meat, three veg and AFL to a true cafÃ©  society and the world game of football.     Just think how bland Melbourne might have been without these decades of  migration.  Who can deny the vibrancy of Lonsdale Street’s Greek precinct in the  heart of the CBD, the vitality of Carlton’s Lygon Street, and the hustle and bustle  of Abbotsford and Chinatown?  More significantly, migrants have exposed us to new ideas and different points of  view, innovative thinking and diverse business nous. Helping us to grow from an  insular Anglo-Saxon society eternally looking back to England for guidance, to a  proud, outward looking people ready and willing to make our mark on the world  stage.   

 MIGRATION AND THE ECONOMY  Outside of the cultural and culinary benefits of our multicultural society,  permanent migration has accounted for some 44 per cent of total job growth in  the past five years and migrants make a significant contribution to Australia’s  budget bottom line.   Over their first 10 years of settlement, permanent migrants arriving through the  2009-10 Migration and Humanitarian Program will provide an estimated net  fiscal benefit of $9.6 billion.  A factor contributing to this positive outcome is the high participation rate in the  workforce of recently arrived migrants, with the Department’s Continuous Survey  of Australia’s Migrants showing that recent migrants had a participation rate 15  percentage points higher than the national average[1].  Further, regarding refugees, the Hugo Report of 2010 showed that humanitarian  entrants make a distinctive and significant contribution to Australian society and  the economy.  About 60 per cent of humanitarian entrants are under the age of 25 and often do  not have family links in Australia.  They are, therefore, more prepared to take up  opportunities in rural and regional Australia, which then creates social and  economic benefits for these local communities.  Humanitarian entrants in particular display greater entrepreneurial qualities, with  a higher proportion engaging in small and medium business enterprises. While  many humanitarian entrants started out as employees, approximately 20 per cent  gravitate towards owning their own business.   This is the great untold story of our refugee program.   Humanitarian entrants have also been found to: 

 

 

 ï· fill labour shortages in low-skill and low-paid occupations  ï· develop and maintain economic links with their origin countries, and  ï· be upwardly mobile between generations - second generation  Humanitarian entrants have, on average, higher levels of post-secondary 

 school qualifications than the Australian-born population.   

 Migration is an integral part of our story of transformation to a world-leader and  our connectivity into Asia and the rest of the world.  Here in Melbourne for example, this city is quickly moving up in the ranking of  global cities and is quickly closing the gap on Sydney.  It has been ranked, for  the second year in a row, as the most liveable city in the world, it is ranked 4th in  the world as a desirable destination for students and it is 17th in the world on an  Innovations City Index.  What this means is that Melbourne is not only an important destination and hub  for Australians, providing an important launching pad for international careers  and access to global labour markets, but, equally, it is increasingly an important  destination for attracting highly mobile global talent that in turn is important for  attracting big business.   

 SKILLED MIGRATION  Today it is impossible, more so than ever, to imagine the flows of information and  knowledge, finance, goods and services without also thinking of the movement of  people.    Moving away from an immigration policy of populate or perish, today our  migration program is well-managed and strategic.   As our economy has grown and developed, under a Gillard Labor Government  our focus has turned to skilled migration to fill what are quite specific economic  needs, as well as meeting our international commitment to share the  responsibility for protecting refugees and resolving refugee situations.    The recent increase in our Humanitarian Program to 20,000 is the largest in more  than thirty years and is on track to achieve levels not seen since the early 1980s.   Through a strong migration program and investment in our people, Australia has  excelled in building the forward looking and prosperous nation we have today.    As a Government, we are preparing Australia for the future and delivering on  Labor values by investing in a strong economy, paid parental leave, a stronger,  fairer health and aged care system, dental care, the National Broadband  Network, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and the Gillard  Government’s National Plan for School Improvement arising from the Gonski  Review.  We have cut taxes, increased super, and invested in skills and infrastructure. We  are determined to tackle global warming and moving to a clean energy future.  Our economy is the envy of advanced countries throughout the world, and in the  race to compete in a globalised economy our people are our greatest strength  and advantage. 

 That’s why it’s so important that we continue to strategically manage our  migration programs. They remain a critical tool in meeting the economic and  demographic challenges that we face.  The quality of our permanent and temporary skilled migration programs is  essential to the future economic development of our urban as well as our  regional areas.  By delivering hundreds of thousands of skilled workers and professionals to our  cities each year we would expect these programs to deliver substantial benefits  to our labour market and the wider economy.  While skilled migration will make an essential contribution to our economic future  by adding to our skilled workforce, enhancing innovation, increasing global  markets and ameliorating the effects of an ageing population, that is only part of  the story.  These skilled migration programs, in particular the 457 skilled temporary worker  visa class, were created with a specific purpose.  Ensuring that skilled migration is meeting our needs and expectations is  something that we as a government take very seriously.    For these skilled programs to succeed we are of course reliant on the collective  success of individual migrants.  Therefore, the UK welder recruited by a heavy engineering firm would be  expected to improve the company’s bottom line through increased production  and by passing on their skills to younger less experienced employees.  Similarly, the Chinese entrepreneur setting up an IT company would be expected  to create new careers for Australians and additional export opportunities  overseas.  Furthermore because cities are at the heart of the knowledge  economy, this employer might seek to obtain a competitive edge by fostering a  workplace culture built around research and innovation.  However, we are also reliant on business doing the right thing, by not exploiting  workers. And this doesn’t only refer to temporary workers coming here from  overseas. It also means that we cannot allow skilled migration visas to  undermine our local job market here in Australia.  And that is why we have introduced important reforms to skilled migration  programs in recent years.  These include: 

 ï· a more targeted skilled occupations list intended to deliver workers with  the skills most needed in our economy;  ï· a re-designed Points test for skilled migration that attaches greater  importance to strong English language skills and gives improved 

 recognition to qualifications obtained overseas; and   ï· a new, more effective mechanism for selecting skilled migrants through  SkillSelect - an online service that enables us to select the best and 

 brightest across a diverse range of occupations.   

 In particular recent changes to the 457 temporary skilled visa include employers  being required to demonstrate there is a genuine skills shortage, and the inability  to send overseas temporary skilled workers to an area where local skilled 

 workers are available. These changes also included closing a loophole that  allowed overseas temporary skilled workers to be paid less than local workers.  Contrary to the cheap politicking of Tony Abbott, these changes to 457 visas are  not an attempt to demonise overseas workers. There are genuine skills  shortages in some sectors and some regions and temporary foreign workers are  needed to fill those gaps.  This is also not about changing conditions for skilled workers who have already  migrated to Australia and who are making an important contribution to our  economy and our community.  This is about ensuring that employers are not exploiting loopholes to bring in  temporary unskilled workers to replace workers already here in Australia.   Similarly, we do not want to see workers brought in through the 457 visas to  undercut the wages of Australians, migrants and permanent residents already in  Australia.   Mr Abbott, true to form, however, has chose to deny the evidence that there are  problems with the 457 visa.   But, as the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Brendan O’Connor said  yesterday  

 ï· If the system is “working perfectly”, why has a business in Parramatta  been able to bring in temporary workers described as “Project and  Program Administrators”, when they are clearly working as security  guards?  

 ï· Why would a Melbourne start-up business which isn’t making any money  bring in a temporary overseas worker and pay them from private funds?   ï· Why is a Perth manufacturing company sponsoring foreign workers at a  salary of $92,000, meaning they are exempt from the English language 

 requirement, then sending them to work for another company at a much  lower wage?   

 Until we tighten the guidelines, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship  cannot take action against these employers. It cannot cancel these visas, even  when it suspects the jobs described have been created solely to bring a relative  into the country, and not to fill a skilled vacancy.  These changes are not going to ‘starve the industry’, they are just ensuring that  people who call Australia home, including those who have been resettled under  our humanitarian and refugee intake are supported appropriately.  Our biggest resource in Australia is the cultural diversity of our people - whether  through people to people links to increase trade relations or bilingual support in  aged care facilities to support our increasingly aging population. These people,  as well as people born in Australia, increasingly come to me saying they can’t get  work.   These people have skills, they bring with them entrepreneurship and innovative  thinking. Yet the system is not working for them, because some companies think  that it is too hard to employ local workers, it is just easier to import workers for a  short period of time, without any support, under false pretences and then send  them back. 

 That is not the type of migration program this Government supports.  If people want to settle in Australia permanently, there are migration pathways to  do this, however the 457 visa program is not that pathway.   

 CONLUSION  The Gillard Labor Government has not only invested in a strategic and well-managed migration program as well as meeting our international obligations to  resettle refugees and humanitarian entrants fleeing persecution and war, but we  have also invested in the social infrastructure to support new migrants who come  to call Australia home - ensuring we remain a socially cohesive society.  Of course, everyone in this room knows this Labor Government’s position on the  value of a multicultural Australia.  Indeed, it was Labor that brought the term ‘multicultural’ back into Government  after the blatantly xenophobic attempts of the Howard Government to deny the  benefits of a multicultural Australia.  And we will fight any attempts to rob Australia of the benefits of multiculturalism.   Australia is a vibrant multicultural nation and generations of migrants have  contributed to our national prosperity. And our national multicultural policy ‘The  People of Australia’ underpins this.  Our approach to multiculturalism has been underpinned by practical integrated  settlement services and strategies - including migrant resource centres,  multicultural youth organisations, English tuition centres and cultural orientation  programs.  Our settlement services are world class - these services are the backbone of our  successful migration program.   Australians are by and large a warm, welcoming people who are more than  willing to give any new migrant a fair go.  This can be put contributed to the optimism, energy and creativity that new  migrants bring to a community.  It is also in the way we as a society encourage  migrants to celebrate their customs and cultures so long as they are consistent  with our own democratic values.  It is this spirit of equality and acceptance that has enabled multiculturalism to  flourish in Australia and to strengthen our society.  And, together, I’m confident we can look forward to many more decades of  cultural growth and prosperity in this, our proudly multicultural nation.  Thank you  END.
