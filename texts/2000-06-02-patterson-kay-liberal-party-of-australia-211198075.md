 Senator Kay Patterson Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

 Media Release

 2 June 2000

 A Fairer Deal for TIS Senator the Hon. Kay Patterson, Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, today announced changes to the Translating and Interpreting Service (TIS) schedule of contractor fees and the scale of user charges TIS uses to charge agencies for translating and interpreting services.

 Fees paid to TIS interpreting and translating contractors will increase from 1 July 2000.

 "The new TIS interpreter and translator contractor fees will generally match contractor fees paid by Centrelink and are competitive with contractor fees paid by other major providers of interpreting and translating services," Senator Patterson said.

 Senator Patterson also announced that a new scale of charges to user agencies will apply from 1 September 2000. This is the first change to the scale of user charges since 1991.

 "Services currently provided free of charge by TIS will not be affected by the changes," Senator Patterson said. "That is, they will continue to be provided free of charge".

 "For example, migrants and refugees will continue getting free interpreting services from TIS when visiting the doctor. Newly-arrived migrants and refugees will continue to get free translations of their personal documents from TIS, within their first two years residence in Australia. Community organisations currently getting free interpreting and translation services from TIS whilst providing settlement assistance to migrants and refugees will

 continue to get these free services.

 "These changes will enable TIS to continue to provide an excellent service to our clients, and attract well qualified, professional interpreters.

 The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has established a hotline to provide advice and explanation of the changes to interested people and organisations. This number is (02) 6264 1777.
