 Thai police snare alleged people-smuggler  

 Thai police have arrested an alleged people smuggler wanted by Australian authorities in  connection with the arrival of a boat carrying illegal arrivals at Ashmore Reef in 2001, the  Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Chris Ellison said today.   

 Masoud Chaudry, a 35-year-old Pakistani national, was arrested in Bangkok yesterday by Thai  police at the request of Australian authorities.   

 Chaudry is alleged to have organised the passage of a boat from Indonesia to Christmas Island  between November 2000 and April 2001. He is wanted in Australia to face prosecution for  people smuggling offences against the Migration Act 1958.   

 He is the subject of an Australian arrest warrant issued in relation to two offences under section  233(1)(a) of the Migration Act, each punishable by a maximum term of ten years  imprisonment.   

 “This latest arrest highlights the Australian Government’s strong and continuing commitment  to bring people smugglers to justice,” Senator Ellison said.   

 “The Australian Federal Police (AFP) and Thai authorities have cooperated closely in the lead-up to Chaudry’s arrest - another outstanding example of the excellent relationships which the  AFP have with their regional law enforcement counterparts,” he said.   

 “The AFP work extremely hard to develop and maintain their international network, with this  effort bringing results in many areas including people smuggling, sex trafficking, child sex  tourism and illicit drug trafficking.”   

 Chaudry is currently in custody in Bangkok and Australia will be immediately applying for his  extradition from Thailand to face an Australian court.   

 “This arrest also demonstrates the strong cooperative relationship on extradition matters that  has been forged between Australia and Thailand,” Senator Ellison said.   

 “The Australian Government will pursue the criminals behind the abhorrent practice of people-smuggling to the ends of the earth and ensure they are brought to justice, wherever they may be  in the world.”
