 STATEMENT ON THE PASSING OF MALCOLM FRASER    

 

 The passing of Malcolm Fraser has left Australia without one of its strongest  voices on human rights and human dignity. I have known Malcolm Fraser for  many years and have always respected his courage and conviction on human  rights and Australia's place in the world.    

 As National Secretary of the AMWU, in the face of some pretty stiff opposition, I  invited Malcolm to address the union's national conference, where he delivered a  speech of conviction and insight on the plight of refugees. Since then, Malcolm  has been a valued friend to me and I was always pleased to receive his advice  and wisdom on human rights issues.    

 Malcolm Fraser will be missed and I wish to express my sincerest condolences to  Tammy and his family.
