  Immigration Minister to visit Adelaide for Refugee Week  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs , Philip Ruddock, will visit Adelaide on  Monday 13 and Tuesday 14 October in support of AUSTCARE's National Refugee Week. 

  "Refugee Week is an important date on the Australian calendar," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "This special week gives all Australians time to think about people, who are fleeing persecution  in various parts of the world. It is also an opportunity to acknowledge the important contribution  that Australia has made , over many years, to helping refugees." 

  On Monday 13 October the Minister will meet and talk with refugees who have recently settled in  South Australia at a 'Welcome to South Australia' function hosted by DIMA and the Australian  Refugee Association. 

  On Tuesday 14 October the Minister will launch a report titled 'Resuming Settled Lives:  Cambodian Refugees in Adelaide' at lOam at the Parks Function Centre. The report looks at the  settlement progress of Cambodian refugees who came to Adelaide in the 1980s. 

  Following the launch of the report, the Minister will confer citizenship on a number of people  from Cambodia in a small ceremony. 

  "Australia has a long history of helping people who are fleeing persecution. In the past 50 years  half a million refugees have resettled in Australia." 

  "That commitment is set to continue with some 12,000 people expecting to settle in Australia  under the refugee and humanitarian program in 1997-98."
