 Parliamentary Secretary congratulates language  innovators 

 15 February 2007 

 Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Citizenship Teresa Gambaro has  congratulated the National Accreditation Authority for Translators and  Interpreters (NAATI) for 30 years of work assisting migrants to settle into the  Australian community. 

 Speaking today before an address at NAATI’s 30th anniversary celebration in  Canberra, Ms Gambaro said the authority had been innovative in improving  standards and services amid three decades of social change. 

 ‘NAATI recorded a 30 per cent increase in the number of tests it delivered in  2005-06, when it offered testing in more than 40 languages,’ Ms Gambaro  said. 

 ‘More than 700 people graduated from NAATI approved courses in the year,  up more than 80 per cent on the previous year.’ 

 Ms Gambaro commended NAATI for developing its online course Introduction  to Interpreting in Australia. 

 ‘This will help overcome the shortage of qualified interpreters in regional and  rural areas,’ she said. 

 ‘It will also give much-needed support in new and emerging languages -  including a range of African languages - so that we can better support our  recent refugee entrants.’ 

 Ms Gambaro said NAATI’s work helping people to understand each other  through translating and interpreting had particular significance for her. 

 ‘I am a first-generation Australian born to Italian migrant parents with English  as my second language,’ she said. 

 ‘This has given me a personal insight into the difficulties faced by people who  have to learn English so they can integrate into Australian society.’ 

 Ms Gambaro said she was impressed by the growth in the authority’s  numbers of new candidates, tests, accreditations, approved courses and  overall revenue. 

 ‘This shows that NAATI is achieving the goals for which it was established and  will continue to make a significant contribution to our society, through  promoting and developing high quality skills in translation and interpreting in  Australia,’ Ms Gambaro said.
