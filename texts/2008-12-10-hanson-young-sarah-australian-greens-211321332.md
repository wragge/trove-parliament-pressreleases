 Australia still has work to do on 60th anniversary of human rights  declaration 

 Media Release | Spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young   Wednesday 10th December 2008, 6:30am 

 Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young says Australia, as a signatory to the United Nation’s 

 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, still has work to do to fulfil its obligations. 

 Today, International Human Rights Day, is also the 60th anniversary of the Declaration. 

 “While we celebrate 60 years of such an important document, we should note that there is 

 still significant work to be done in this area,” said Senator Hanson-Young. 

 “The significance of this universal document is that it applies equally to all people - but 

 unfortunately, even in this country, we can see cases where some people’s rights are not 

 being upheld. 

 “Today’s anniversary should serve as a timely reminder as to what more Australia, as a 

 signatory to the Universal Declaration, can do to uphold universal human rights.” 

 Senator Hanson-Young pointed to Australia’s treatment of asylum seekers and refugees as an 

 issue needing attention. 

 “The way we have treated desperate people who flee to Australia for our protection needs an 

 urgent rethink,” she said. 

 “It is not illegal to seek asylum. 

 “The practice of mandatory detention, especially in isolated facilities such as those on 

 Christmas Island, and a lack of judicial oversight of detention, are examples of Australia 

 letting down its obligation to uphold human rights. 

 “These practices have also damaged our country’s international reputation.” 

 Senator Hanson-Young said she looked forward to Attorney-General Robert McClelland’s 

 statement today on the Federal Government’s National Human Rights Consultation. 

 “The Greens hope that the rights of refugees and asylum seekers are taken into consideration 

 during the formulation of any future protection of rights, such as a charter or bill of rights,” 

 she said. 

 “I look forward to the Attorney-General’s announcements today, and to learning who the 

 panel of experts conducting the consultation will be."
