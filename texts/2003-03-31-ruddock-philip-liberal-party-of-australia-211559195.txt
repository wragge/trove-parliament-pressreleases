 Philip Ruddock MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 

 Humanitarian Program Intake For 2003-04

 MPS 19/2003

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today announced 12,000 new places  for Australia's Humanitarian Program intake for the 2003-04 program year.

 'In addition to the 12,000 new places, the Humanitarian Program will be supplemented by any unused places rolled over from  the current year's program,' Mr Ruddock said. 

 Within the program, there will be an estimated 4,000 places for refugees resettled from offshore.

 With the decrease in numbers of unauthorised arrivals - there has been no boat arrival of substance since December 2001 -  there will continue to be a greater scope to accommodate the demand offshore under the Special Humanitarian Program  (SHP).

 'The SHP is for people in refugee-like situations with links to Australia and who have suffered human rights abuses in their  home country. I expect over 7,000 places will be available for this purpose,' Mr Ruddock said. 

 A notional 700 places have been set aside to meet possible needs for those granted protection visas in Australia.

 Regional priority in the Program will continue to be given to Africa and the Middle East as recommended by the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 

 'The Humanitarian Program can be managed flexibly to deal with any specific needs arising out of the present Middle East  conflict and the situation will continue to be monitored closely,' Mr Ruddock said. 

 'We will look to see what role resettlement can play, if any, in addressing refugee displacements in the region as part of any  coordinated international effort.

 'Within the Humanitarian Program we will continue to give priority to people who are in the most vulnerable situations, and  have the greatest need for resettlement places,' Mr Ruddock said.

 Australia is one of only ten countries that operates a dedicated resettlement program each year. The resettlement program goes  beyond any international obligations and reflects Australia's desire to assist refugees and people in humanitarian need. 

 The latest refugee resettlement intake figures published by UNHCR (in June 2002) show Australia as ranking third after the  United States and Canada in the number of refugees resettled in 2001.

 For each of the last five years Australia has had a program of a total of 12,000 new humanitarian places for offshore 

 resettlement and onshore protection applications.

 This figure is arrived at through consultation with the Australian community, the UNHCR and taking into account the number  of new humanitarian entrants Australia can reasonably manage. 

 The costs of sustaining refugees will include a generous suite of settlement services to help refugees successfully settle into  Australian society.
