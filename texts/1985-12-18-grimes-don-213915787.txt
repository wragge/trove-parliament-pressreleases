 ASSISTANCE TO REFUGEE CHILDREN

 Refugee children will be cared for under services provided by  the Federal Government's Children's Services program.

 The Minister for Community Services,  Senator Don Grimes said  today that he had extended grants to five centres which are  currently being funded on a 'pilot' basis. The five centres  are in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide.

 Sufficient funds would now be provided to enable the centres to  operate for a further period until June 1986. Under the  'pilot'  arrangements,  funds would have expired at the end of  this year.

 In the mean time, the government will consider the situation  and decide whether some more specific long term arrangements should be introduced,  possibly in conjunction with the  Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.

 Senator Grimes said that the 5 existing centres were providing  a valuable service to children.

 They include such work as family mediation, counselling and  welfare advice, education programs and community liaison.

 Most of the children involved are members of the Vietnamese and  Khmer communities.

 Senator Grimes said that many of these children had arrived in  Australia in very distressing circumstances.

 "I believe it is important to provide them with the necessary  help now to assist them through their first difficult years in  Australia", he said.

 The 6 months extension of funding for the 5 projects will cost  an additional $62,846.

 "The relatively small amount of money involved is a good  investment in the future for these children", Senator Grimes  said.
