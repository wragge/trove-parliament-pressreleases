 Most Arrivals in a Decade to Australia

 VPS 003/2005

 Australia attracted the largest number of migrants and refugee entrants in a decade in 2003-04, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and  Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today.

 Releasing the 2003-04 figures for the first time, the Minister said more than 111 000 people arrived and settled in Australia in 2003-04, an increase  of nearly 20 000 from the previous year’s total of 93 914.

 ‘The increase is in line with a general upwards trend over the past decade - in 1993-94 just 70,000 settlers arrived in Australia,’ Senator Vanstone  said.

 ‘This means that in the past 10 years arrivals have increased by 60 per cent, with well over 200 countries represented.

 ‘Australia has a wonderfully rich and diverse society as a result, with nearly one in four of Australia’s 20 million people born overseas.’

 The largest number of people came from the United Kingdom (18 000), followed by people from New Zealand, China, India, South Africa, the  Sudan and the Philippines.

 ‘On top of these figures are the growing numbers of people becoming permanent residents after arriving in Australia, such as overseas students  who apply for skilled migration onshore,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘Our ongoing commitment to new and innovative visa programs and the increased efficiency and integrity of immigration processing means that  Australia continues to attract more and more people from around the globe.’
