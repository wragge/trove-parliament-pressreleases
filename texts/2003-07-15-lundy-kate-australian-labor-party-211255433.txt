 Museum Review a time warp back to the 1950’s   

 The review of the National Museum of Australia advocates a whitewashing of  Australian History. This is in accordance with John Howard’s view that  Australia should focus on the great achievements of white men in Australia,  rather than the complex and diverse stories that make up Australian culture. 

 This disappointing review recommends that we should be simply retelling the  stories we learnt in school, rather than adding to our understanding of all  facets of our Australian history, and provides some hackneyed "suggestions"  for implementing these stories. 

 Instead of advocating a 21st century museum exploring our national make-up,  the review prefers a 20th century museum which puffs up "exemplary  individual, group and institutional achievements." 

 Australians would rather have a "fair dinkum" approach by their national  museum when looking at our past, rather than some kind of historical public  relations exercise. 

 The review goes further to suggest that if there is not enough tangible  evidence to substantiate events then they may not be included in the  Museum’s collection.  To imply that ‘oral evidence’ specifically relating to the  ‘Contested Frontiers’ exhibition, which deals with the mistreatment and  massacre of the Aboriginal people, is perhaps not enough to justify the telling  of this story, is abhorrent. 

 Colonial authorities were not averse to white-washing the murders of  Aboriginal people by leaving them out of the records. Now John Howard's  hand-picked review panel wants the NMA to continue the whitewash in our  national museum. 

 The review also implies that the ‘Horizons’ exhibition which contains a module  corner devoted to quarantine of immigrants creates an ‘unbalanced’ view of  migration to this country.  This is an absurd attempt to wipe out any truth  relating to the treatment of immigrants and refugees by our country.  

 I agree with the concerns of the review about shortcomings concerning the  construction of the museum building.  The review highlights that;  "Acoustic  problems to the point of cacophony, through much of the public space, arise  because of poor design and application, and inferior quality equipment."  In  other words, budget cuts have impacted on the quality of the building. 

 I call on the Howard Government to reject this whitewash of Australia’s history  and to fund the necessary infrastructure improvements.
