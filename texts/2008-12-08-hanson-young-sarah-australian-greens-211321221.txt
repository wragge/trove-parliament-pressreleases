 Humane immigration policy an international obligation, not a  liability   

 Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young has slammed claims that changes to  Australia’s immigration policy has caused a surge in suspected asylum seekers  reaching Australia in boats.   

 A boat carrying 44 suspected asylum seekers was intercepted off Broome yesterday,  bringing this year’s total of detained asylum seekers to 127. Last year 150 asylum  seekers arrived by boat. 

 

 “These are the same old scare-mongering lines being trotted out by hangers-on from  the Howard and Ruddock regime,” said Senator Hanson-Young.   

 “Human beings, desperate to escape a life-threatening situation, will resort to  services of people smugglers if no other option is available.   

 “It is our responsibility, under international obligations, to support these people when  they arrive within Australian territory.”   

 Senator Hanson-Young pointed out that this Wednesday 10 December is the 60th  anniversary of the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   

 “May this International Human Rights Day serve as a timely reminder that it is not  illegal to seek asylum,” she said.   

 “Rather, it is a human right, protected by international law.   

 “We must not let the politics of fear cloud our actions on these matters on human  rights and justice.   

 “The Greens urge Immigration Minister Chris Evans to ignore the fear-mongering,  and introduce legislation to enshrine his Government’s new immigration policies  without further delay.”
