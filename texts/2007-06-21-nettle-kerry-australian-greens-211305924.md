 Senator Kerry Nettle   Australian Greens Senator for New South Wales 

 

 

 Climate Refugees Bill  introduced into Parliament   

 21.06.07   

 Australian Greens Immigration spokesperson Senator Kerry Nettle today  introduced the Migration Amendment (Climate Refugees) Bill 2007 into  the Senate.    

 “The Bill introduces a new climate refugee visa and sets up mechanisms  for the Minister for Immigration to set the numbers and parameters for  accepting climate refugees,” Senator Nettle said   

 “The Greens hope that all parties will support this important bill that is  the first step to managing what will be a major issue in the coming  decades.   

 “The Stern report concludes that 150 - 200 million people will be displaced  by climate change by 2050, while Christian Aid estimates up to 250  million climate refugees will be on the move between now and 2050.   

 “Last week the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon wrote an  opinion piece in the Washington Post arguing that climate change was  partially responsible for the crisis in Dafur which has displaced two  million people.   

 “The first climate refugees will be in the Pacific from low lying islands  such as Tuvalu and Kiribati.     

 “This bill would provide a mechanism for Australia to respond to the  repeated requests from the governments of Tuvalu and Kiribati to take a  set number of climate refugees each year.     

 “New Zealand is already taking 75 people from Tuvalu and Kiribati each  year. The Greens are calling on the Government to accept around 300  climate refugees per year that would ease the pressure and assist with an 

 orderly evacuation as Tuvalu and Kiribati as they succumb to rising seas.   

 “The Greens are also calling on the government to create an international  framework to deal with climate refugees. The Greens Climate bill is due to  be debated in August 2007,” Senator Nettle said.
