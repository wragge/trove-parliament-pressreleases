 Senator Kate Lundy  Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Citizenship 

 

 

 New chair and deputy chair for Settlement  Council of Australia  Friday, 12 November 2010 

 The Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Kate Lundy,  congratulated the new chair and deputy chair of the Settlement Council of Australia  (SCoA) appointed at its annual general meeting today. 

 SCoA is the national peak body representing migrant and refugee settlement  agencies across Australia, providing advice on migrant and refugee settlement  issues. 

 ‘The new chair, Cedric Manen, who is the general manager of Southern Tasmania's  Migrant Resource Centre, is ideally placed to advise on refugee and migrant  settlement matters,’ Senator Lundy said. 

 ‘Immediate past chair, Ricci Bartels, who is manager of Sydney's Fairfield Migrant  Resource Centre, will take up the role of deputy chair. 

 ‘The government needs a strong sector and an organised and collaborative  representative body with clear direction, like SCoA, is critical. 

 ‘The government is committed, in partnership with the settlement sector, to help  improve settlement outcomes for new arrivals,’ Senator Lundy said. 

 ‘The welfare of the sector and its capacity to deliver are key criteria for judging the  effectiveness of government policies. 

 ‘Achieving the best settlement outcomes is a continuous effort and I look forward to  working closely with the sector in the future. 

 ‘I would like to thank the past chair, Ricci Bartels and deputy chair, Gail Ker for the  work they have undertaken and I look forward to working closely with Mr Manen and  Ms Bartels in the future.’
