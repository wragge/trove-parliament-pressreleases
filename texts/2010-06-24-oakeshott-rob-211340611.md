 MEDIA RELEASE 

 24 June 2010 

 RUDD THE LATEST VICTIM OF CLIMATE CHANGE WARFARE 

 THE climate change storm has claimed its second parliamentary leader, with both Malcolm  Turnbull and Kevin Rudd being taken out by the power-hungry faceless men within the  Labor and Liberal parties, leaving the issue of a secure and affordable energy mix for  Australiaâs future still unresolved, Independent MP for Lyne Robert Oakeshott said today. 

 “Rudd, Gillard, Abbott and Turnbull all admit climate change action by the Parliament is  inevitable, yet it is extraordinary how politically toxic this inevitability is,” Mr Oakeshott said. 

 “We now have a clash within the two major parties between this long-term, national interest  inevitability that any leader must address and the short-term, day-to-day, poll-driven,  political wings of these same two major parties. And somewhat unfortunately, the poll-driven political wings continue to win out. 

 “This leaves Australia exposed on policy and without a secure and affordable energy mix for  our future.   

 “I call on new Prime Minister Gillard and the Leader of the Opposition to stop the âenergy  policy warfareâ and to seek consensus on this issue.   

 “As can be seen yet again today, no-one wins by making this âmoral challenge of our timeâ  the âpolitical issue of our timeâ, and it is in the national interest that consensus can be found  quickly. 

 Mr Oakeshott added that from his personal perspective, accusations that Mr Rudd failed to  consult his Parliamentary colleagues were incorrect. 

 “I spent an hour with Mr Rudd on Tuesday evening, and he talked in an engaged way on  Afghanistan, local government issues, asylum seekers, climate change, the mining tax, the  Chinese delegation visit, and a hung parliament,” Mr Oakeshott said. 

 “He was engaged and across his brief.  In whatever he chooses to do from here, I  personally wish him well.”
