 DEMOCRATS:

 FRIGATE DEPLOYMENT IS A WASTE OF PUBLIC FUNDS

 The Australian Democrats said today that the deployment of  Australian frigates to the Middle East carried a huge cost but  no benefit, and that the money could be much better spent in  alleviating the plight of refugees in Jordan.

 Democrat leader Senator Janet Powell, saidt "The Government has  admitted that the deployment will cost $100 million per year, or  $300,000 per day, above normal operating expenses.

 "Just twelve day's costs —  $3.6 million —  would completely fund  UNICEF's request for emergency assistance to the refugees in  Jordan. But so far Australia has pledged only $500,000 of aid."

 Senator Powell will be represented by Senator Sid Spindler at  tomorrow's (Sunday) public meeting on the Gulf crisis at 3pm at  the Uniting Church Centre, 130 Lt Collins St, Melbourne.  The  meeting is a project of several Victorian organisations.

 Senator Spindler said that the frigates were not performing any  useful tasks.

 "The flow of oil from Iraq ceased even before the naval buildup  began", Senator Spindler said. So did the supply of arms, and a  large proportion of food imports.

 "Any future leakage through the oil embargo would best be  minimised by applying diplomatic pressure on the purchasing  countries, not by naval action. The United Nations has already  persuaded Yemen not to accept Iraqi oil shipments.

 "And the question of food imports is a political problem for  which no military solution exists. The UN sanctions exempt food  for humanitarian purposes, and all medical supplies.

 "Shortages are already occurring, and India, Iran and China have  given notice that they intend to send food to Iraq and Kuwait.   Any international difference of opinion over this issue will only  be resolved by negotiation.

 "Naval action against Chinese or Indian cargo vessels would  provoke a major international incident, which will rebound on  Australia at a time when we are trying to build our links with  Asia", Senator Spindler concluded.
