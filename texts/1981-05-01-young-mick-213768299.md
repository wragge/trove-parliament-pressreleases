 INTRODUCTION

 Basically two main themes run through the "Review of Commonwealth  Functions" (or as it is commonly known, the Razor Gang Report).  Firstly, anything that is profitable is sold to private enterprise,   and secondly, whatever is difficult to manage (like hospitals) 

 is given to the States.

 The area of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs did not escape.

 It is estimated that nearly $10 million will be cut from (or raised  from the sale of) the Department's present expenditure and services.

 By comparison with the Prime Minister's Department, the ethnic  communities, newly arrived immigrants and refugees have been dealt  with harshly indeed by the "Razor Gang".

 The following is an attempt to comment on the specific cuts and  changes proposed by Mr Fraser in the "Review of Commonwealth  Functions" in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and  in a number of other areas directly affecting immigrants and refugees

 1. ASSISTED PASSAGE SCHEME

 Abolished. This scheme in the past applied nearly exclusively to  British immigrants and refugees. Indeed, the meeting of Labor  Ministers and Shadow Ministers for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  discussed this issue in Adelaide on 26 October 1979 and it  recommended that in the future the Assisted Passage scheme;

 "(1) should be means tested; (2) should not favour citizens of any particular country; (3) should cover passage costs for refugees; (4) at the discretion of the Minister, should be :  available to persons who do not meet the

 :  'means test'  requirements in the form of an  interest free loan, repayable within a  3-year period; .  (5) should be repaid if a person leaves Australia 

 before the 3 years residence in this country  expires."

 3.

 $15,000 Indo-Chinese refugees (average cost $352) $ 4,000 East European refugees (average cost $935) $ 8,500 other assisted migration (average cost $586).  By abolishing this scheme it is estimated that the Government  will save approximately $6 to $7 million.

 2. CITIZENSHIP *  I

 According to the Razor Report, the "admtnt-6tfiattve pfio czdu.fi &Î &ofi Qfia.ntd.ng  â   ctttz en6 htp u>ZZl b e  AtfizamZtnzd" .

 No-one really knows what is meant by the word "streamlined".  There  is already an average waiting period of some 15 weeks between  application and the actual granting of Australian citizenship. Indeed,  a waiting period in excess of 8-9 months is not uncommon.

 I find strange such "streamlining" especially when only recently  it was announced by the Minister for Immigration, Mr MacPhee that  only Australian citizens will be eligible to vote from 1/1/1982.

 Which means that potentially there will be an additional 1.2 million  applications for Australian citizenship within the next year or so -  from British immigrants alone.

 According to statements by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs, the Australian Citizenship Act will be completely reviewed  before the end of this year (possibly in the Budget session).  It's  worth pointing out that the idea is again "borrowed" from the  A.L.P. In a paper entitled "Legislative Reform" and released in 

 September 1980, my predecessor, Dr Cass, emphasised the need for ‘   a complete review of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948.'·

 The revision of our Citizenship Act is urgent because of the new  citizenship provisions being introduced in the Parliament of the  United Kingdom. They are proposing to abolish the term "British  subject" and 3 different types of British citizenship will be 

 introduced.

 Until 1948 Australians were considered simply "British subjects".

 The concept of Australian citizenship is of relatively recent origin.

 2.

 This decision has been published by my predecessor, Dr Moss Cass  in a paper entitled "Rationalisation of 'Assisted Passage', 'Family Reunion1  and 'N.U.M.A.S.' Schemes",  shortly after the  Adelaide meeting. It has also been made available to the  officials of the Department of Immigration and to the Minister 

 for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.

 The proposal that Assisted Passages will be means tested for  refugees no doubt is 'borrowed' from that paper. From now on  "refugees with available assets above $20,000 in the case of  families, and $10,000 in the case of individuals, will be required  to meet the cost of their travel to Australia", said Mr MacPhee  in a press release dated 30 April 1981.

 "At the present time, Australia has formal agreements involving  the provision of Assisted Passage with six countries; Germany  (Fed. Rep.) in force since 1962; Italy in force since 1971; Malta  in force since 1970; Netherlands in force since 1965; Turkey in 

 force since 1967; and Yugoslavia in force since 1970", said Dr  Cass in his paper.

 Perhaps it's worth mentioning also that although the vast proportion  of Assisted Passages went to immigrants from Britain, the agreement  between Australia and the U.K. has expired years ago.

 Mr Fraser said that:

 " n e g o t t a t t o Î·Î (u)ZZl) be. 6 0 u g k t  u)Ztk m t g f i a t t o n 

 a.gne.e.me.nt c o u n t A t e -Î t o  ÏÎÎ¹Î±Î e. o u t  the. AÎÎÎÎÎ¯Î¶Î¬  Î¡Î±ÎÎÎ±Î²Îµ Sche.me.".

 It is symbolic of the great haste with which the whole "Razor Report" was put together that they didn't even have the time to advise the countries concerned of the decision made by this Government.

 In 1980-81, $13.2 million was allocated for Assisted Passages  for 30,000 immigrants and refugees. This sum represented a 77%  increase compared to the 1979-80 expenditure. Indeed, an additional  $800,000 was sought only a few weeks ago in the "Additional  Estimates 1980-81". The $14 million in 1980-81 was to be spent  as follows:

 4.

 Indeed,  there are strong suggestions that the swearing of allegiance  to the British monarch should be replaced with an oath of allegiance  to the Australian Constitution.

 On the average around 60,000 people each year are granted  Australian citizenship.  Streamlining of citizenship is urgently  required. In 1980-81 some $2.27 million was allocated to the  citizenship branch in the Department in salaries alone.

 3. INFORMATION SERVICES

 According to the Minister for Immigration, Mr MacPhee, "economies  will be made by ceasing production of two weekly bulletins For  The Ethnic Media and From the Ethnic Press and of a monthly  compilation of D.I.E.A. news releases".

 Without a doubt there is not going to be many tears shed over the  publication From the Ethnic Press.  It was constantly Criticised  by politicians, editors of the ethnic press and community  groups because of "selective" information. Often one had to  wonder how the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs could  publish such biased political propaganda. The quality of the 

 translation was not "crash-hot" either.

 Of course the question remains, how will the public, politicians,   journalists and interest groups in the community be informed of the  numerous articles appearing in various languages in the ethnic press.  According to Mr MacPhee, the Foreign Language Newspapers Association 

 intends to produce "a compendium of material translater from the  Ethnic Press".

 However,  according to my information,  the Foreign Language Newspapers  Association does not intend to publish anything of the kind.  "Certainly, not without a Government grant", they said. "Although  there was some talk about it a year ago because of the poor quality 

 of the publication known as From the Ethnic Press,  the idea  was dropped because of the prohibitive cost somewhere between  $200,000 and $300,000 to produce a good quality publication", they  said. Indeed, one of the members of the Association has applied 

 for a grant but he was told by the Department that "we will not 

 finance anyone".

 5.

 As far as the other publication For the Ethnic Press is concerned, I must say that I found it somewhat odd that for the general English  press, there were one set of press releases while the ethnic press  was treated like children with "pre-digested" news and resumees of 

 the original press releases. If the Government is set on informing  the ethnic media they could do it just as well with the original  press releases.

 According to the "Review of Commonwealth Functions",  the "VipaAtminf A Zn^oAmatZon a oZi (u)ZZZ) be  Î‘Î±ÎÎÎ¿Î·Î±ÎÎÎ id" .

 The Minister for Immigration said that "an ZntiAdipaAtmintaZ £at>k gAoup u>ZZZ AivZiu)  £hi AoZi ofa thi VipaAtmint o £ ImmZgAatZon and  EthnZi A i faaZtu, Zn pAovZdZng Zn^oAmatZon ÎÎ¯Î‘ÏÎÎ¹ÎÎ.

 Thi ÎÎ±Îk gAoup u)ZZZ compAZM Î‘Î¯ÏÎ‘ÎÎ intatZvÎ¹& o f a  £hi VipaAtmint Î¿Î² ImmZgAatZon and EthnZc Afa^aZAA, Finance, £ki PubZZc SiauZci BoaAd and £ki ku.6tAaZZan  În^oAmatZon SiavZc i".

 Many of the information services presently provided in Australia by  the Department of Immigration to newly arrived immigrants, refugees  and the ethnic communities in general are very poor indeed.

 In the financial year 1980-81 some $963,000 was allocated for "Migrant  publicity" and another increase of $24,000 was sought in the  "Additional Estimates 1980-81, only a few weeks ago. Of this,  nearly 78% ($766,800) will be spent on overseas expenditures and  on information material for use overseas. Only $220,000 will be 

 spent in Australia, which also includes, the $74,000 already spent  on materials and publicity for the R.O.S.P. programmes.

 It is hoped that the Interdepartmental Task Group will come up  with something much more efficient than what we have today, both for  intending immigrants prior to their departure overseas and for  the newly arrived immigrants and refugees in Australia.

 The information provided by the Departments for overseas use will  have to portray truthfully all aspects of life in Australia starting  from employment to housing and from social security to health  services provided in this country, in order to allow intending  immigrants to make a fair judgment whether or not they want to 

 uproot their families and migrate to Australia. This information 

 should be aimed at settlers not tourists.

 6.

 The information needed by immigrants, refugees and the ethnic  communities in Australia should encompass all services provided  by Government,  semi-government and voluntary organisations. The  role of the ethnic press is crucial in providing this information.

 But sadly they are not consulted by the Government.

 It is somewhat strange to set up an information service for the  ethnic communities and not to consult with the journalists and editors  of the ethnic press when they are providing that information already  for nearly two million people every week.

 4, COMMITTEE ON OVERSEAS PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS - C.O.P.Q.

 The "Razor Report" recommends that "charge* for examination o f qualification* be  intn.od.uccd where appropriate".

 Indeed "the Government embraces the principle of "fee for service"  and considers this should be extended to other C.O.P.Q. activities".

 The role of the C.O.P.Q. is to evaluate professional,  technical and  general academic qualifications attained overseas, and to assist other  assessing authorities in Australia with advice on the standing  of such qualifications.  For this purpose, $181,000 was allocated 

 in 1980-81.

 The introduction of fees for the recognition of overseas qualifications  will certainly not solve the confusion surrounding this area. In  fact it might only add to the hardship of many qualified immigrants  who,must work in menial jobs because they can't afford to have 

 their qualifications recognised.

 There is an urgent need for efficient mechanisms for the recognition  of overseas trade, technical and professional qualifications. At  present, there are some 22 major types of authorities involved  in some way in the evaluation of the qualifications of immigrants.

 There are also 6 Commonwealth Departments up to 40 State and  Territorial departments and potentially over 100 autonomous and  semi-government bodies involved in this area.

 7.

 No Australian employer is legally obliged to recognise any overseas 

 degree,  with the probable exception of those of British universities.

 The present absence of any enforceable or conventionally accepted  responsibility on the part of employers and accrediting bodies to  take account of the advice of a competent authority means that the  system functions largely on goodwill, and that a qualified immigrant  has no redress when goodwill proves to be lacking.

 It would be necessary to restructure C.O.P.Q. as a professional  research unit. This reorganisation would involve, among other things,  delegating responsibility for administrative decisions and  individual assessments to the secretariat staff, instituting a more 

 comprehensive career structure within the secretariat, and taking  measures to ensure the recruitment of more staff with appropriate 

 specialist qualifications.

 The design and administration of screening examinations should  be delegated to a specialist body with appropriate expertise - either  a special unit within C.O.P.Q.,  an outside body, or a new unit  established for the purpose.

 The introduction of fees simply places an additional burden on the  individuals without solving the inefficiency of the present setup.

 5. ADULT MIGRANT AND REFUGEE EDUCATION

 The "Razor Gang" Report states that the "Commonsealtk't note, [will] be restricted to  arranging and co-ordinating only, by rellnquls king  tint, possibility loti thn conduct o l Individual programs. 

 Field activity will bn contracted out to State and  non-govntinmnnt bodies. Allowance payments will be  made by the Department Î¿l Social Security".

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs stated that these  proposals are "consistent with the present close working  arrangements with the State Adult Migrant Education 

 Services which conduct most of the activities  within the program".

 8.

 Mr MacPhee also said that:

 "the Department of Social Security will take  over responsibility for physical payment of  Education Living Allowances to migrants and  refugees attending full time English, language  courses. This new arrangement will reduce  problems of transition between Social Security  Benefits and Education Living Allowances and  provide a better service for adult migrant 

 and refugee students".

 Many State Ministers will be furious,no doubt,  with these new  arrangements, given that they have no say whatsoever about the  number or the selection of immigrants and refugees coming to  Australia.

 Although,because of the lack of Commonwealth activity in this  area,the States were already providing most of these services, the  present proposals rather than rationalising the Adult Migrant  Education Service will further confuse who is really responsible 

 for the teaching of English td newly arrived immigrants.

 In fact, the present changes outlined in the "Review of Commonwealth  Functions" run contrary to the recommendations of the Galbally Report  The Galbally Report, adopted by the Government, recommended (amongst  other things) that the

 "existing courses be extended in availability;  "in-service" development for teachers be developed;  the permanent nature of the programme be recognised;  and that the Commonwealth and the States assess the  need for a formal agreement to recognise their 

 separate responsibilities for E.S.L. teaching and  to provide for the collection of information  necessary for planning and evaluation".

 The Commission of Inquiry into Poverty in its Fifth Main Report  Poverty and Education in Australia said that the whole English  language program for immigrants needed more resources and a new  strategy. The Commission recommendations included

 "extending and improving the program so that it  is used more extensively in the work environment;   ethnic groups to be consulted at each stage in  the preparation or programs;  employers to be encouraged to allow attandance at  on-the-job classes".

 But nothing is being proposed by the "Razor Gang" along these lines.

 9.

 Certainly none of these problems will be overcome by transferring  responsibility of an inefficient system to the States. It is  better planning more foresight and efficient allocation of funds  that is needed rather than washing the Federal hands of all 

 responsibility.

 In 1980-81 the sum of $28.02 million was appropriated to provide  English language instruction and orientation information classes  for adult immigrants and refugees and to provide a range of 

 associated and supporting services and facilities. Another $841,000  was sought in the "Additional Estimates 1980-81" a few weeks ago,  in order to pay for higher work value awards for teachers and an  increase in the rates of payment for living allowances.

 The whole area of Adult Migrant and Refugee Education is  characterised by a total confusion. Often the right hand doesn't  know What the left hand is doing. The proposal to transfer  certain responsibilities to the States while retaining certain other  areas under Federal responsibility will achieve but one thing, between 

 two chairs, the immigrants will sit on the floor, yet again.

 The "Razor Gang Report" makes no mention of permanent employment  for the thousands of teachers employed in this area. Makes no  reference to a career structure which could attract better qualified  teachers. Makes no provision for better training for teachers or  on updated curriculum material. Indeed it rarely ever mentions 

 the "clients" the immigrants and the refugees for whom these  programmes are supposed to be provided.

 Given that the Department of Immigration is responsible for the  recruitment of immigrants it is fair to say that the Department  should also assume direct responsibility for the administration of  post-arrival services including English language teaching and  curriculum development.

 As far as the transfer of allowance payments to the Department of  Social Security is concerned, no doubt it might result in more  efficient management. But I wonder whether or not it might also  result in longer waiting hours and more bureaucratic red tape for 

 clients who do not only have no knowledge of our Social Security  system but who do not even have a workable knowledge of English.

 10.

 6. POPULATION AND LABOUR MARKET RESEARCH

 The "Review of Commonwealth Functions" says that "po putatton and Zabour market res earck acttvtttes  (wlZZ)  be rattonaZtsed between departments o &  Immtgratton and Etknte Afi&atrs and EmpZoyment 

 and Youth. Afifiatrs and stafi&tng wtZZ be reduced ".

 Mr MacPhee said that "a Population Branch has been created within the  Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to  provide an identifiable body to focus Commonwealth 

 activity in population matters.  The Branch will  monitor and analyse the implications for Australia  of population changes both in Australia and overseas  and strengthen the ability of the Government to 

 respond positively to these changes".

 To be truthful the rationalisation of the present system is long  overdue.  Indeed, the "feud" between the two Departments came to  an open clash when the new system of selecting immigrants >  N.U.M.A.S.,  was introduced by the then Minister for Immigration,  Mr MacKellar.

 A high ranking official of the Department of Employment openly  criticised the system because officials in his Department could  see very little relationship between the immediate need for skilled  and unskilled workers and the recruitment of these immigrants  overseas.

 In fact, the compilation of the monthly list of employment needs  and its application to the recruitment of immigrants came to an  end shortly after it's introduction.  The Department of Immigration  now uses the six monthly report compiled by the Department of Employment.

 There are a number of other difficulties with the present system.

 We have a so-called "Entrepreneur scheme" and a "small businessmen  scheme" whereby certain people after the payment of a considerable  sum of money (on the average $500,000) may bypass the normal  immigration requirements and they are allowed to settle in Australia 

 (including their families) provided that the proposed project is a  viable one. In the financial year 1979-80, some 244 persons of which  78 were entrepreneurs and 166 were dependents, were admitted to  Australia.

 11.

 I do not know how much money will be saved by this proposal of the  "Razor Gang" in the Department of Employment. As far as the  Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is concerned $1.22 million  was allocated to the Population Planning and Research section for 

 salaries and studies in the financial year 1980-81. An additional  $67,000 was sought in the Additional Estimates 1980-81. Besides  these expenditures there are a number of other salaries "buried"  under the Management, Selection and Review, Settlement and Advisory  Councils headings.

 7. TRANSLATION/INTERPRETING SERVICES

 The "Review of Commonwealth Functions" states that the "tAan*latlon *eAvlce* Mill b e  tAan* j e t t e d  to pAlvate .   agencle* MheAe they can pAovlde the teAvlce; wlthdAawn  tn aAea* o f a  pAlme State Ae*pon*lblllty,  changes to be

 TAanilatoA* and InteApAeteA* ( Mill) become  * elfunding a* *oon a* po**lble".

 This is what the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacPhee had to offer by way of explanation,  to the sweeping  changes proposed by the "Razor Report":

 "The Telephone Interpreter Service provides an essential  service primarily for emergency situations and an  information service. Most calls are in normal weekday  working hours.

 Experience has shown that staffing does not need to be  duplicated in each centre of migrant population.

 With use of the telephone diversion equipment, local  calls can be automatically transferred anywhere in  Australia at the cost of a local call to the caller and  with efficient service to clients. In this way, the 

 Telephone Interpreter Service has been extended well beyond  what the Galbally Report recommended.

 Further use of diversion equipment is intended. This  will avoid the cost of continuously operating the Telephone  Interpreter Service by office-based staff at times when  there are very few calls.

 12 .  1

 Under the new system there will be 10 hours of fully-  staffed operation from Monday to Friday. Calls made  outside those core hours will be automatically switched  to interpreters on stand-by.

 The substantial cost of maintaining fully-staffed services  in less populous States will be avoided by diverting calls  to larger services interstate where interpreters are more  readily available and clients will have access to a  greater range of languages.

 .  On-the-spot interpretation by contract interpreters will  continue to be provided where necessary. Guidelines will  define where this service will be provided.

 There will be no reduction in the effectiveness of the  service by reducing the number of hours operated by  office-based staff or diverting calls interstate to larger  services. The aim is to achieve greater economies by using  new technology without any reduction in the effectiveness  of the service. The new arrangements will be phased in to 

 ensure that the effectiveness of the service is not reduced.

 Translating services are currently provided by the  Commonwealth, some State Governments and the private sector.

 The Commonwealth has encouraged State Governments to provide  these services by funding of cost-sharing arrangements.  These will be continued and extended. Those State Governments  not yet participating will be given the opportunity of doing so.

 In future the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  will concentrate on providing translation facilities within  areas of direct Commonwealth responsibility, focussing  particularly on programs designed to facilitate the initial 

 settlement of migrants.

 Basic Commonwealth translation services will still be  required where other Departments, State authorities and  organisations,  or the private sector, for various reasons,   are not able to provide these effectively.

 The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will  recover the costs of translation work done on behalf of  Commonwealth and State authorities and for private firms  and organisations.

 The private sector will be encouraged to play an increasing  role in providing translations to firms, organisations  and individuals.

 The Government established the National Accreditation  Authority for Translators and Interpreters (NAATI) to  ensure that proper standards of interpreting and  translating are set and maintained and to test and 

 accredit people who meet these standards.

 13.

 Î¤Î 1C Authority has been active in testing and acerediLing  interpreters and translators. A pool of qualified persons  is being developed throughout Australia and is expanding.   This is a big task because more than 100 languages and  dialects are in common use.

 Recently it was announced that NAATI will also develop  standards, testing and accreditation procedures in  Aboriginal languages.

 It is proposed to work towards the development of  self-funding, self-regulatory and representative body in :   the interpreting and translating profession itself, which  eventually will take over from NAATI the role of accrediting  interpreters and translators in accordance with the 

 standards it has set".

 The Department of Immigration's Ethnic Affairs Branch presently  combined within one administrative structure the following three  services which previously were under separate administration:

 (1) the telephone interpreter service (since 1977) ; (2) the community interpreter service, now integrated  with the telephone interpreter service in the form  of a "pool" of contract interpreters who are 

 "on-call" (when needed) to provide on-the-spot  interpreting; (3) the translation unit which is involved mainly in  work for the Department and other Commonwealth 

 instrumentalities. It also provides translations  for a few individuals, mainly qualification  certificates, employer references and other  documents which are considered essential for 

 settlement purposes.

 State Departments of Immigration and State Ethnic Affairs bodies also  employ interpreters and translators for similar purposes to the  Commonwealth. Indeed, the Galbally Report recommended that subsidies  should be provided to the States to encourage them to employ more 

 interpreters. There was no mention ever of completely transferring  these services to the States.

 Several major banks also provide advice in community languages and  translation of documents free of charge to their customers.  Although  the quality of the translations provided by these services is to say  the least dubious,  many immigrants seem to find them more accessible  than Government departments.

 14.

 In addition to the above services there are a number of private agencies  who operate on a fee for service basis. Some States also employ their  own court interpreters and other specialised interpreters (e.g. hospitals)

 The National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters (NAATI)  was established in 1977. The objectives of the Authority are to develop procedures necessary to provide a means of accreditation for interpreters and translators and to provide advice and guidance to tertiary institutions on the content of courses in translating and interpreting. Its principal objectives are to establish standards and conditions leading to professional status.

 The Authority is also responsible for the development of the basic  infrastructure for the emergence of a national self regulatory  professional body in the expectation that this body will, within  five years,  assume responsibility for the profession including 

 accreditation»

 In 1977, NAATI, following international usage has adopted a  five-tier classification for the accreditation of interpreters.

 The budget allocations for the services mentioned in the "Review of  Commonwealth Functions" in the financial year 1980-81 were as follows:  Translators and Telephone Interpreter Service, $1.25 million;  subsidies to the States for translators and interpreters, N.S.W.

 $105,000; Victoria, $70,000; S.A. $60,000, a total of $235,000;  overseas interpreting and screening fees, $37,000; NAATI $78,000.  Translation fees for multilingual material used overseas  and in Australia should also be included but the expenditure on 

 these services would be very difficult to dissect from the budget  allocations. An additional $300,000 was sought in the "Additional  Estimates 1980-81" a few weeks ago for the Translating and Interpreting  Service,  which adds up to a total of approximately $1.87 million.

 Somewhat contrary to what the Minister had to say about the Telephone  Interpreter Service the Department of Immigration sought the additional  $300,000 because "The Telephone Interpreter Service has experienced  a significant and progressive increase in demand... calls to T.I.S.  grew by 46% between January 1980 and January 1981" .  It is somewhat  difficult to understand therefore how the Telephone Interpreter  Service's hours of operation can be reduced.

 15.

 The Minister argues that thanks to new technology, "calls made outside  core hours will be automatically switched to interpreters on  stand-by".  I know that in the last decade, new technology has  achieved some amazing things. I must confess,  that I would very  much like to see a telephone that automatically distinguishes between 

 Greek, Turkish, Italian and Arabic and it switches automatically to  the specific interpreter on stand-by.

 As far as switching from one city to another is concerned, I am  somewhat preoccupied because without the knowledge of the local  conditions, the task of an interpreter can become quite difficult.

 I can visualise someone ringing the telephone interpreter service  about a serious car accident on Hindmarsh Drive near O'Malley or a fire  on the corner of High Street in Casuarina and hanging up. How would  an interpreter in Sydney know where O'Malley is or another one in  Melbourne have knowledge of Casuarina in Darwin.

 Without a doubt there is a pressing need to rationalise and  restructure the present interpreting and translating services. But I  don't believe that the best way to do that is to sell it to private  enterprise or to give it to the States, because the Federal Government 

 can't cope with it.

 A paper entitled Rationalisation of Interpreting and Translating Services  was circulated by my predecessor, Dr Moss Cass, late last year and it  has received enthusiastic support from the ethnic committees,  academics, translators and interpreters. Perhaps it is worth 

 repeating some of the changes necessary outlined in that paper:

 "More emphasis should be put on the recruitment of  specialist translators with professional or para-professional  qualifications, especially among those who for one reason or  another have been unable to gain full recognition for 

 their qualifications.

 The Government Translation and Interpreting Service could  fulfil a much greater role if they were provided with the  funds and facilities to employ sufficient staff.

 Shopfront offices such as the "Migrant Information Centres" (or Resource Centres) should be provided in the suburbs  and country.

 16.

 Immigrants should not be forced to pay profit-making concerns  (e.g. banks or private "speculators") for their essential  translation and interpreting needs.

 The Community Interpreters Service should employ at least  a "nucleus" of staff conversant in the major community  languages on a full time basis.

 The staff and functions of the Translation Unit (D.I.E.A.)  should be expanded in order to allow access to translating  facilities for the public and various agencies (perhaps on  a fee-for-service basis for the latter).

 Responsibility for persons employed as translators/interpreters  in Regional Offices should be given to the Director of the  Central Translation Unit.

 NAATI certification has no legal status at present.

 A barrier in improving standards both within the D.I.E.A.  and the Public Service in general is the limited career  structure for interpreters and translators.  A separate  career structure for professional and sub-professional 

 translators and interpreters should be provided, similar  to those which now exist for librarians and library officers  (for example).

 There is a need for some form of professional registration  to ensure that adequate interpreting and translating standards  are maintained. Professional registration implies the  existence of a controlling body to monitor both professional 

 standards and ethnical conduct.

 Commonwealth and State laws could be amended to ensure that  all translations of legal documents and those connected with  health and safety be carried out by a registered translator  or interpreter.

 There is a completely unrealistic attitude towards the number  of languages in which a translator/interpreter is expected to  be proficient. It is extremely rare, indeed, it is doubtful,   that there are more than a few people in Australia today who  would be competent in more than three languages,  including 

 English.

 In general, there is an urgent need to extend the number of  staff and funding for translating and interpreting (including  NAATI)".

 As far as the question of translators is concerned, no doubt by giving 

 it to private enterprise the cost of translations will more than  double.  In a reply given to the House of Representatives Estimates  Committee the Department of Immigration states that the Department  is charging "between $4 and $9 for 100 words according to the language  concerned. Rates charged by certain organisations known to the

 Department range from $9 to $25 per 100 words".

 17.

 The Department's expenditure on translators in 1980-81 was $70,000.

 8. NATIONAL GROUPS DIRECTORY

 The "Review of Commonwealth Functions" states that the "product-ion (Î¿ l the directory will) be discontinued.

 Mr MacPhee said that "publication of a directory providing details of  ethnic organisations throughout Australia will  cease. A revision to be published in the near 

 future will be the last to be issued by the  Commonwealth".

 According to the Department of Immigration some 3,000 copies of  the Directory were printed each year. The printing cost is $15,000  but it is estimated that an additional $50,000 is spent on staff  salaries in collecting,compiling and checking the information 

 (and postage)i

 It is surprising that the National Groups Directory, perhaps the  only useful document produced by the Department which has allowed  various groups to get in touch with each other will be abolished in  order to save $65,000 for a budget of $80 million. For many community 

 organisations,  voluntary agencies, politicians and Government bodies  the Directory was the only means whereby they could get in touch  with various ethnic organisations to inform them about their activities.

 9. OVERSEAS SERVICES

 The "Razor Report" states that "overseas based sta^i associated u)itk the recruitment  and s election Î¿ I persons Ïor settlement in Australia  [will) be reduced".

 The press release issued by the Minister for Immigration did not  offer much by way of explanation about this move.

 At present, the expenditure on overseas services and overseas staff  is as follows:  salaries and allowances, $5.32 million; overtime, $82,000; travelling and subsistence, $1.2 million;  stationery and  special publications,  $80,000; telephone services, $18,000;

 18.

 incidental and other expenses $386,000 (international movement  conLrol salaries and overtime overseas $1.89 million;  executive  services salaries and overtime overseas, $810,000) ;  overseas  visits, $115,000; COPQ overseas consultants,  $18,000; information  material for use overseas $429,000; repatriation, $82,000.

 In the "Additional Estimates 1980-81" a few weeks ago the following  increase in funds was sought; salaries and allowances, $376,600;  travelling and subsistence,  $175,700; stationery,  $10,000;  telephone services, $1,700; incidental and other expenditure,

 $52,000; contribution to the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration,  Fifth Seminar, $1,500. .

 At present 154 persons are employed by the Department of Immigration  in its overseas offices.

 The rationale behind seeking additional funds for the overseas services  of the Department was that there has been a "significant increase in  workload" overseas. In the "September quarter, migrant applications  increased by 55% compared to the previous years. The principal 

 increases were from U.K. and Ireland, 51%; Asia, 73%; North  Europe, 94%; South Europe, 97% and North America, 58". Visitors  visa applications have also increased by 13%.

 Given such an increase in demand, it is very difficult to understand  how the Department can cut its overseas staff.  Indeed, a general  confusion seems to reign in the higher echelons of the Department  in attempting to comply with Mr Fraser's directive. No-one in the 

 Department knows where and how they can reduce the existing overseas  staff.

 A number of private companies and indeed the Public Service Board is  already advertising overseas for skilled immigrants.  A cynic might  legitimately ask, what is the use of the Department of Immigration  and immigration policies, if private individuals do the recruiting?

 19.

 10. TEMPORARY ENTRY TO AUSTRALIA

 The "Review of Commonwealth Functions" states that "aequ-iA. Î¯ ’ ,Î·Î·Î¹Î·ÎªÎ and pao ceduftei (w-ilZ)  be. Ataeamtd.ned".

 The Minister for Immigration. Mr MacPhee, in his statement did  not offer anything by way of explanation on this subject.

 The functions of the temporary entry branch are the control of entry  and re-entry in Australia of short term visitors on business,  tourism,  etc. private overseas students, people on short term employment,  entertainers and sportsmen, working holiday makers, and academic 

 staff.  They are also responsible for the extension of visas and  for arrangements for new bilateral visa agreements.

 In 1979/80 some 876,000 people were admitted to Australia for short  stay. This figure includes also some 30,000 people on working visas.

 In 1980-81 the Budget of the temporary entry section included  $732,971 for salaries and allowances. An additional $60,000 was  sought in the "Additional Estimates 1980-81" for salaries and  allowances. .

 The additional sums allocated to the Branch would be difficult to  dissect from the balance sheets of the other Branches within the  Department.

 It is my understanding that the streamlining will consist of two  main elements.  Firstly, it is proposed that more discretion will be  given for overseas posts to approve temporary entry to Australia.

 Until now, applications for visitors visas to people who intended to  stay in this country for a period in excess of 4 months, were  referred back to Australia. From now on it is proposed that overseas  posts will have the discretion to issue visitors visas up to a period  of 12 months.

 Secondly, it is proposed that executives of large international  corporations coming to Australia who have already undergone a medical  screening by their companies would not have to undergo another  screening in order to be allowed into Australia. Thus, it is argued /

 20.

 a duplication of medical checks (and the bills that go with it)  would be prevented. .

 11. ADVISORY BODIES

 The "Review of Commonwealth Functions" states that "a single a.dvt^oA.y cou.nc.-il. (ivtZZ) AcpZacc the  Au&tAaZtan Ethntc AHatAi CounctZ, kubtuaZtan  Po puZatton and ImmtgAatton CounctZ, kui>tnaZtan 

 Rc^uQCd) kdvtbofiy CounctZ” .

 The Minister for Immigration, Mr MacPhee, offers the following  by way of explanation:

 "A new advisory body, the Australian Population Advisory  Council,  has been set up to advise the Minister for  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.

 Previously,  there were three advisory bodies:

 .  the Australian Population and Immigration Council  .  The Australian Ethnic Affairs Council, and  .  the Australian Refugee Advisory Council.

 They have provided a foundation of constructive, informed advice  which will be available to the new Council.

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs also receives  advice from the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs.  The Minister will continue to consult with a wide range of  ethnic and community organisations on matters within his 

 responsibility.  The current NUMAS forum provides an  example of this. .

 The Australian Population Advisory Council will concentrate  resources in providing advice on the major policy aspects of  the immigration and ethnic affairs portfolio with emphasis on:

 .  population and immigration policies  .  refugee matters  .  citizenship .  control over entry to Australia, and  .  post-arrival services to migrants related to the 

 immigration function.

 The Council will complement the work of the Australian  Institute of Multicultural Affairs.

 The membership of the Council will include prominent people  from business,  industry, trade unions, ethnic communities  and voluntary services, together with academic experts  in disciplines closely related to the functions of the  portfolio.

 A Population Branch has been created within the Department of  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to provide an identifiable body  to focus Commonwealth activity in population matters. The Branch

 21.

 will monitor and analyse the implications for Australia  of population changes, both in Australia and overseas,  and strengthen the ability of the Government to respond  positively to these changes".

 The proposal to "scrap" the various advisory councils goes  contrary to the recommendations of the Galbally Report.

 The danger is that by having one council only to advise the Minister,  less and less people in the community can have an input into the  policy and decision-making process.  On the other hand, it could  lead to increased efficiency in the Department if the members of 

 the Council will be carefully selected on the basis of their  experience and expertise rather than political expediency.

 The expenditure on these advisory councils in 1980-81 were:  Australian Population and Immigration Council, $44,000; Australian Ethnic  Affairs Council, $56,500; Australian Refugee Advisory Council, $38,000.

 12. MANAGEMENT OF MIGRANT HOSTELS

 The "Review of Commonwealth Functions" under the Department of Administrative Services states that "rn.igA.ant hostel manage.mo.nt ( uitZl)  b e  taani> l eA.A.ed  to the. pA.tvate. &eetoA. on a management lee aA.A.angement" .

 I have little doubt that in many centres the transfer of responsibility  for the operation of Migrant Hostels to private enterprise will open the  door to unscrupulous entrepreneurs to take advantage of newly  arrived immigrants and refugees.

 No-one knows how much money will be saved by selling these services  to private enterprise. No-one could give me a satisfactory answer  to the question, what will happen if the lowest bidder will be  higher than the present expenditure?

 There is also a question of principle involved here. If the  Commonwealth accepts responsibility for migration and the recruitment  of immigrants and refugees from overseas, they must also accept the  responsibility of looking after these people on and after their  arrival in Australia.

 22.

 13. OTHER PROVISIONS

 A number of other provisions will severely affect many newly  arrived immigrants, refugees and the ethnic communities in  general. I will mention only a few of these provisions:

 * Cleaning and watching of Commonwealth properties.  We all know that unfortunately, most of the cleaning and catering jobs in Australia are done by immigrants and refugees. Many of these people do not have a permanent position in the Public Service either because they have arrived only recently to Australia or because they are not Australian citizens. The Razor Gang's

 decision is however, that

 "cleaning and watchtng o f a  CommonuJzaZth pAo pzAttzs  (wilt) bz undzAtakzn by thz pAtvatz s z z£o a".

 No doubt many immigrants and refugees will lose their jobs

 as a result.

 * Government Printing and Publication.

 "TAansfizAAzd to thz pAtvatz szctoA and A G P S  bookshop  to bz tzaszd to thz pAtoatz szztoA".

 Many immigrants are employed in the Government printing offices.

 They have brought to this country a high degree of skill and expertise in the field of colour printing, setting and binding.

 Now many will be left without employment. '

 * Australian Legal Aid Office.  The only avenue to seek legal  redress for many immigrants and refugees will be transferred to  the States, which in effect means dismembering the office.

 * Consumer Affairs Activities.  Considerably reduced. Many immigrants  and refugees will find it very difficult to find an avenue to  complain against unscrupulous businessmen.

 * Eligibility for TEAS and Students Loans.  Will be limited only to  those students who are in absolute need. In many other cases it is to be "scrapped". This provision needs no comment from  me because I am sure that students and teachers alike will voice 

 their dissatisfaction in the weeks to come.  In effect the  changes introduced by the Razor Gang in the field of education 

 will assure only one thing - education for the wealthy.

 23.

 * Rationalisation of Colleges of Advanced Education.  The only  avenue for many refugees and immigrants to acquire better  qualifications,  to have their overseas qualifications recognised and  to acquire an education while forced to work was through the  evening courses of the various Colleges of Advanced Education.

 Rather than expanding these services,  the "Review of Commonwealth  Functions" will assure Australian industry of a cheap labour force  of those who cannot have their qualifications recognised and  indeed, of those immigrants, refugees and their children who will not be able to obtain any qualifications.

 * Advisory Bodies.  Advisory bodies in most Government departments  will be abolished or considerably scaled down. Obviously either  this government knows everything or they do not want the advice  of the experts, and that of the community. Any hopes therefore 

 that the ethnic communities might have an input in the various  Departments even on an advisory capacity, are very meagre indeed.

 A number of other major changes coupled with the cancellation of the  Medibank scheme indicate that the present government is set on the  course of handing over all profitable functions to private enterprise.  The States are entrusted with projects which the Federal Government 

 found too difficult or indeed impossible to cope with.  .

 The leadership crisis in the Liberal Party, the growing dissatisfaction  of backbenchers with government policies and the general revolt in  the Senate about the lack of direction, purpose and foresight of  the present Government are but an indication of the growing  - dissatisfaction of Australians with the present policies.

 Politicians are astute people. They know when they are about to  â lose their job. No doubt we haven't heard the last of the  "Razor Report".
