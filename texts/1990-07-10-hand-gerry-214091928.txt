 SUCCESSFUL ASYLUM SEEKERS TO HAVE ACCESS. TO GOVERNMENT

 Successful asylum claimants who are given four-year  temporary residence permits under the Government's new  refugee and humanitarian policy will be given access to a  variety of Government services.

 Chinese nationals who were in Australia on 20 June 1989 who  are allowed to stay in Australia for four years under  special temporary residence arrangements announced recently  will be given the same access.

 This was announced today in a joint statement by the  Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, and the Minister for Finance,  Mr Ralph Willis.

 The services are Special Benefit, Family Allowance, Family  Allowance Supplement, Medicare, labour market programs,   English language training and education.

 The Ministers said Special Benefit, with the addition of  family allowances in the case of families, acted as a safety  net to cover survival needs for people who had no access to  other Social Security benefits such as pensions and  unemployment benefits.

 The Government considered that if Special Benefit was denied  to people in desperate need, it could lead to cases of  severe hardship and destitution with a consequential impact  on the voluntary sector.

 Thus it was decided to extend the Benefit to the Chinese and  other asylum seekers given temporary residence, but only  where severe hardship was demonstrated. There would be no  automatic entitlement to it.

 On Medicare, the Ministers said access to the program was  considered essential for survival. It was also prudent as a  preventive health measure which could halt more serious  health problems developing among the people concerned.

 Access to labour markets, they said, was highly desirable to  encourage self-sufficiency, to maximise likely useful  contribution to the economy, and to reduce the potential use  of Social Security benefits. Successful claimants would be  able to participate in the full integrated range of labour  market programs.

 The Ministers said a facility with the English language was  fundamental to participation in the labour market and in  community activities, and the Government considered that the  provision of language training to survival level was  —entirely appropriate.

 Access to the Adult Migrant Education Program would be given  to all except those who had studied under English Language  Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS) programs.

 Any additional vocational language needs would be assessed  on a case-by-case basis and met by labour market programs of  the Department of Employment, Education and Training.

 On other education needs, the Ministers said access would be  given to primary and secondary education and to the  English-as-a-Second-Language program for the children of  Chinese and other successful asylum claimants.

 The benefits will be available after the introduction of a  new class of four-year Temporary Entry Permit on 1 August  1990.

 Asylum seekers who lodged applications before 27 June 1990  will be able to gain access to these benefits by withdrawing  their outstanding applications and reapplying under the new  refugee and humanitarian arrangements announced last week.
