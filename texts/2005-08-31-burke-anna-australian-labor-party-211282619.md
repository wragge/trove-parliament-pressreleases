 Anna Burke MP  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR CHISHOLM   

 

 

 MEDIA RELEASE  Wednesday August 31, 2005   

 Burke launches online petition calling for rights  for asylum seekers   

 Federal Member for Chisholm Anna Burke has launched an online petition on  the National Forum website - http://petitions.nationalforum.com.au - calling for  work rights and Medicare access for all community based asylum seekers.   

 “The Howard Government currently prevents around forty per cent of  community-based asylum seekers from accessing any form of income  support, employment rights or health benefits,” Ms Burke said.   

 “Although families released from detention as a result of the Howard/Georgiou  compromise have income support and access to healthcare, countless  asylum seekers already living in the community have no such rights.   

 “How does Amanda Vanstone expected these people to survive?     

 “If it wasn’t for the various charities and church groups many of these people  would have nowhere to live, nothing to eat and no way to access health  treatment.  As it is, the most these organisations can afford to provide an  individual is $35 a week.   

 “Sadly, many asylum seekers are not aware of the benevolent support  available to them, as the Department of Immigration doesn’t refer them to  these services.  What do they do?  Who do they turn to?   

 “The Howard Government’s inconsistent immigration policy is putting peoples’  lives at risk - there are cases of asylum seekers suffering malnutrition and  being turned away from doctors when they urgently need medical treatment.   

 “I hope this petition will show the Howard Government that it has a long way  to go on the road to a more compassionate immigration policy,” Ms Burke  said.

 The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the fact that: 

 â¢ Thousands of community-based asylum seekers in Australia are denied income support, work rights and  Medicare access as a result of the Government’s unfair and inflexible immigration policy, making survival  nearly impossible without the assistance of various church and charity groups.   â¢ In many cases this breaches the Refugee Convention and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  

 Your petitioners therefore ask the House to ensure that the Government: 

 â¢ Abolishes the ‘45 day rule’, which prevents community-based asylum seekers who make visa applications  outside that period from receiving any form of income or health benefits.   â¢ Gives all community-based asylum seekers in Australia work rights and access to Medicare.
