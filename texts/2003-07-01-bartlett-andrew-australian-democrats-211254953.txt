 Senator Andrew Bartlett   Leader of the Australian Democrats  1 July 2003                          MEDIA RELEASE                                    03 /477                

 

  “No War” cries not the answer in human rights battle   

 The world community needs to find ways to deal with dictators other than launching wars,  Australian Democrats’ Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, told an Amnesty International (AI) Pacific  Forum in Sydney today.   

 “There are real challenges facing those concerned about human rights. War is not the answer, but it  is not enough to just oppose war. Those working for peace have to enunciate and implement  practical alternatives,” Senator Bartlett said.   

 “War is sold as a simple solution to rid a country of a dictator but it doesn’t always improve the  circumstances of ordinary people in the short or long term. Doing nothing is also no solution.   

 “Practical plans and alternatives to war are the key to working for peace and seriously addressing  human rights concerns.  Simplistically decrying war is not enough.”   

 Senator Bartlett told the forum: “Under the Howard Government, Australia has become isolationist  in its dealings with refugees, careless of the image it projects to the region, and militarily aggressive  in its coalition with the United States. 

 “The United Nations, regional forums and bilateral meetings are all important ways Australia  should be interacting with the rest of the world.   

  “As a predominantly white western nation geographically in Asia, and a middle power in global  terms, the more communication and trust building exercises we can be part of, the better.”   

 Senator Bartlett praised Amnesty’s work campaigning against human rights abuses.   

 “Amnesty’s  eye  witness  accounts  and  thorough  research  makes  it  an  invaluable  source  of   information for parliamentarians and members of the public. Since its establishment 42 years ago,  AI  has  developed  into  one  of  the  most  powerful,  effective  and  widely  respected  human  rights   organisations in the world.    

 “AI  is  well-known  for  its  active  participation  in  the  parliamentary  committee  process,  which  is   where  many  of  these  issues  are  explored.  If  it  wasn’t  for  parliamentary  committees  and  inquiries   most of what Parliament worked on would be tax law.”   

 Senator  Bartlett  said  the  Amnesty  International  Parliamentary  Group  provided  a  forum  for   politicians to work together and, occasionally, put party politics aside to talk frankly about human  rights  issues,  such  as  the  ongoing  detention  of  Australians  David  Hicks  and  Mamdouh  Habib  at   Guantanamo Bay.
