 23 December 2003                  MEDIA RELEASE                                 03/909 

 

 GOVT’S ONLY OPTION IS TO BRING EIDREISS HOME   

 The  Federal  Government  has  clearly  breached  an  official  agreement  with  South  Africa   regarding  refugees  following  its  treatment  of  a  Kuwaiti  man  currently  stranded  in   Johannesburg after being deported from Australia. 

 Eidreiss  Alsalih,  who  was  born  in  Kuwait  to  Sudanese  parents,  was  removed  from  a  WA   detention centre 11 days ago and flown to South Africa, where he was refused permission to  continue  on  to  Sudan,  and  instead  was  sent  to  Tanzania,  before  being  flown  back  to   Johannesburg. 

 Australian Democrats Refugee spokesperson Kate Reynolds said the Mr Alsalih’s treatment  clearly  breached  the  “Joint  Ministerial  Statement  In  Support  of  Mutual  Co-operation   Between  Australia  and  South  Africa  On  Migration,  Refugees,  Irregular  Migration  And   People Smuggling,” signed on August 2, 2002 in Cape Town. 

 Ms Reynolds said the document, under the heading “Transit Arrangements For Returnees”  stated: 

 “The Australian Government undertakes that it will accept these returnees back into  Australia should their return to their countries of origin not materialise; 

 “Returnees  may  not  remain  in  the  transit  area  for  longer  than  24  hours  before   proceeding on a connecting flight” 

 Ms Reynolds said, given that Mr Alsalih had been detained in a Johannesburg transit lounge  for  four  days,  and  had  been  refused  entry  to  Sudan,  the  only  option  available  to  the   government - in accordance with the joint ministerial statement - was to bring him back to  Australia. 

 “There  is  no  other  way  around  this,  he  simply  has  to  come  back  to  Australia,  where  he   should be released into the community, as he cannot be detained indefinitely,” she said. 

 “The  government  must  bring  Mr  Alsalih  back  immediately,  he  has  been  subjected  to  this   distressing and inhumane treatment for far too long already. 

 “This government simply cannot ignore its own agreement, and must act accordingly. It was  willing  to  send  him  away  from  Australian  shores  without  taking  responsibility  for  the   consequences, but that has backfired.”
