 THE WAR AGAINST TERRORISM

 I would like to thank the American Chamber of Commerce for the honour of addressing this audience today.

 This anniversary is, above all, a time to remember and to reflect. But it is also a time to recognise the strength and resilience of the American and Australian peoples, and to renew our resolve.

 The impact of 11 September

 We will all remember for the rest of our lives where we were as the terrible events of 11 September unfolded. 11 September was a defining moment - not only for the United States but for the global community.

 At the individual level, our thoughts today are with those most directly and terribly affected: the families and friends of the victims, including the Australians killed.

 But even for all of us not touched immediately by the tragedy, the world was different after 11 September. For those of us in countries such as Australia used to feeling safe and secure as we go about our daily business, the terrorist attacks brought a new and very foreign sense of insecurity.

 The 11 September attacks have been likened to Pearl Harbour, but they were different. They were attacks, and intended as such, on the symbols of a free and open system of government, an economic model and a way of life - and therefore on values we share with the United States.

 The attacks made many of us stop and think more carefully about what is important in our lives. They made us appreciate how lucky we are - that we are able to go about our daily lives in freedom and safety.

 But they also reminded us that we cannot take this for granted because there are those in the world who are committed to the destruction of that freedom.

 They have reminded us that, unfortunately, sometimes we have to defend our values and our way of life.

 For the United States the trauma is clearly immense. The national psyche has been profoundly affected. 11 September has reverberated through every aspect of American life - the economy, politics and society.

 There is a new sense of vulnerability. But there is also a sense of resolve. The terrorists planned and hoped to bring the United States to its knees, but in many respects 11 September brought out the best American impulses - not least courage and an unshakeable purpose.

 Of course although the attacks took place in New York and Washington, they killed not only Americans. The victims came from all over the world including, of course, Australia, and from many faiths.

 In this the attacks symbolised the global nature of contemporary threats to our security and the frightening reach and lethality of networks such as al Qaeda.

 This is why our Government moved quickly with the US Administration to invoke the ANZUS Treaty - for the first time in its long history. We recognised not only that our ally had been attacked, but that the threat to us had increased also.

 It took 11 September to bring home the reality which had been growing for some time. The signs were there in the attacks on the US embassies in Africa and on the USS Cole and other seemingly isolated events.

 It is only with the advantage of hindsight, however, that we have started to comprehend the sophistication, extent and fanaticism of this threat.

 Arrests in Europe, and America as well as the Middle East, Africa and Central Asia have brought home the immediacy of the peril. And, for Australians, the arrest of a terrorist cell in Singapore - with our High Commission as one of its targets - brought the threat uncomfortably close to home. None of us is immune.

 Because of this, 11 September had a rare unifying effect - something the terrorists did not count on.

 It brought together a remarkable international coalition. It has had a positive effect on great-power relations, and we’ve seen unprecedented cooperation across the globe in diverse areas including law enforcement, intelligence sharing, border management and control of financial flows.

 In the process it has become clear that we can best defeat this threat if we work together.

 Progress in the war against terrorism

 These efforts by the international community have met with considerable success.

  

 Over 2,000 suspected al Qaeda members have been arrested around the world. Al Qaeda has lost Afghanistan as a base for training and weapons development. Its communications and funding have been put under pressure. The international legal framework dealing with terrorism has been strengthened.

 More immediately, a number of planned al Qaeda activities have been disrupted. To name just a few examples:

 An al Qaeda plan to attack shipping in the Gibraltar Straits was disrupted by Moroccan security forces âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Members of an al Qaeda cell in Spain were arrested by Spanish authorities âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» The arrest of the would-be radiological or ‘dirty’ bomber, Jose Padilla, is thought to have averted an al Qaeda plot to stage an attack in the United States âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The arrests last week of extremists planning an attack in Germany - although it is possible they were working alone. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 In each case innocent lives have been saved.

 The nature of the war against terrorism is still evolving, but it is clearly a very different kind of war. It is not a war being fought out between nation states on the conventional battlefield.

 But it is a war nonetheless. Despite the views of some, it is not so much a religious or cultural conflict as an ideological conflict. The terrorists’ objective is to intimidate us into compromising our values and ultimately to supplant them. The terrorists win if we let them divert us from living our lives according to our own values and from pursuing our national interests in the way we see fit.

 Their ambitions are global. 11 September was designed to have strategic effect as well as tactical impact. Al Qaeda has been described as having many of the characteristics of a state but without borders.

 While military action is not the only element of the response to this threat, it is a critical component. As we have shown in Afghanistan, it is necessary if we are to destroy those who would succour and sustain terrorists and to dismantle their infrastructure.

 The war against terrorism has aspects of more conventional wars - such as the Taliban’s use of formed units and tactics and the use of US airpower. But it also has distinctly new elements.

 The terrorists seek to exploit the strengths that come with free and open societies and globalisation - such as the freedom to come and go, airliners, credit cards and the internet - and turn them into weaknesses. They use the products of our highly developed economies - from ‘box cutters’ to airliners - to cause disproportionate death and destruction; this is the phenomenon known to strategists as ‘asymmetry’.

 This is a major challenge for institutions set up to deal with conventional conflict.

 In the United States this has seen the development of a new government structure responsible for ‘homeland’ security and has spurred the process of military transformation. We have witnessed ‘network-centric’ warfare being taken to a new level in Afghanistan in the powerful imagery of US special forces mounted on horseback alongside Afghan tribesmen calling in precision airstrikes.

  

 In Australia it has brought new anti-terrorism legislation, fighter patrols over the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, the creation of the Incident Response Regiment to address chemical, biological and radiological threats and creation of a second counter-terrorism force.

 Of course we operate on an entirely different scale of military capability, but Australia has played an important role in the coalition military operation in Afghanistan, and this is an appropriate time to consider what has been achieved as a result.

 Australia’s personnel in Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan and the Persian Gulf will be pausing with us today to reflect on the reason why they are there. Our thoughts are also very much with them and their families. We can be proud of their achievements and those of the many ADF personnel who have supported their deployment back in Australia.

 It sometimes seems to be taken for granted now, but the destruction of the Taliban regime was a major achievement not just in terms of the war against terrorism but for the Afghan people and the international community.

 It was the necessary precursor to dismantling al Qaeda in Afghanistan and disrupting its operations globally. Some have escaped, but many terrorists have been captured or killed. The detainees have provided invaluable intelligence which has thwarted further attacks and led to arrests - including those in Singapore late last year. These results would have been impossible without military action.

 Moreover, the defeat of the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan was sudden and humiliating. It represented a shattering psychological blow to al Qaeda operatives and their supporters and sympathisers. Movements such as this thrive on success, and nothing is more effective than crushing defeat to deflate them and reduce their appeal.

 Finally, we should acknowledge the opportunity that has been created for the Afghan people. The coalition put an end to an atrocious regime - one of the world’s least tolerant with an appalling record for human rights violations.

 The situation in Afghanistan remains fragile and far from perfect, as illustrated by last week’s bombing in Kabul and the attempt on the life of President Karzai. But nevertheless conditions have been established in which the Afghan people can begin to rebuild their lives and their country and take control of their own future. Refugees are returning home in vast numbers, and girls have returned to school. It is up to the Afghan people to take this opportunity.

 The next phase of the war against terrorism

 So what next in the war against terrorism?

 Firstly, there is clearly more to be done in Afghanistan. Military operations there have entered a different phase, with the focus shifting from destroying remaining al Qaeda and Taliban concentrations to tracking down remnants, and preventing them from regrouping or infiltrating back into Afghanistan.

 The longer-term challenge in Afghanistan is stabilisation and nation building. The entire international community has a stake in this process, including Australia, as it is the only way to prevent al Qaeda and the Taliban from again taking root there. This is, however, not just a military task.

  

 Moving beyond Afghanistan, it is clear that global law enforcement and intelligence efforts have to continue. Al Qaeda has been diminished, but it is still functional, adaptive and dangerous. Senior al Qaeda figures remain unaccounted for and may be operating out of other countries in South Asia, Central Asia, Africa and the Middle East.

 Al Qaeda and associated groups retain the capability to conduct terrorist attacks around the world, particularly but not only in Muslim countries. Recent examples include the explosion which killed 11 French nationals in Karachi in May, the bombing of a synagogue in Tunisia in April which resulted in 19 deaths and the explosion outside the US consulate in Karachi which killed 12 in June.

 The international community needs to remain determined, proactive and well coordinated in its response. We need to confront the fanatics.

 But we also need to address the environments from which they grow and are sustained. Poverty, injustice, oppression and prejudice must all be addressed. Aid, diplomacy and effective partnerships can help avoid state failure. Education and capacity building are critical if we are to limit the support base of the extremists.

 We also need to address the extension of these terrorist networks into our own region.

 Since 11 September it has become apparent that the past decade has seen the emergence of a real terrorist threat in South East Asia.

 This has been manifest in the attack on the Philippines ambassador in Jakarta, the December 2000 bombing of churches in Indonesia and bombings in Manila, and a spate of other small bombings throughout the region.

 It is also evident in the scouting of the US embassy in Jakarta, the December 2001 plan against embassies in Singapore including Australia’s and plans for attacks on the US and Israeli embassies in Manila.

 Australia welcomes the steps South East Asian governments are taking to address these threats, including arrests and a range of measures to increase regional cooperation. We remain committed to supporting these efforts. We have signed MOUs on countering terrorism with Indonesia and Malaysia and are negotiating a similar arrangement with Thailand.

 My department is playing its part in these efforts, including by providing training in intelligence and counter-terrorist techniques and more generally by strengthening regional capabilities through the Defence Cooperation Program. At our meeting of regional Defence Ministers mid year, there was strong agreement that increased cooperation is fundamental to the eradication of terrorist networks in our region.

 Weapons of mass destruction: Iraq

 The carnage of 11 September and the ensuing feeling of vulnerability have also stiffened international resolve to confront the awful reality of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

 As I have said before, the major lesson of 11 September is that it doesn’t pay to avert our eyes from a developing threat. Our worst fears can and sometimes do come true unless we are prepared to act firmly and decisively. 11 September was so shocking because it went beyond our worst fears. That was bad enough, but now the real nightmare scenario is an attack with chemical, biological or even nuclear weapons.

  

 It is for this reason that the US administration and other governments, including Australia’s, are of the strong view that Iraq’s regime can no longer be allowed to remain in breach of UN resolutions and the terms on which hostilities were suspended in the Gulf War in 1991.

 Our argument does not rest on Iraq being involved in the events of 11 September. Rather, Saddam Hussein’s weapons programs have become a risk impossible to ignore. We should not forget that Iraq both has used weapons of mass destruction and remains a state sponsor of terrorism.

 We have made clear that we wish to see Iraq comply with UN resolutions and end its weapons program. We have also emphasised that we see the responsibility for ensuring this happens resting with the international community as a whole, not just the United States.

 We have also emphasised that continuing inaction and prevarication can no longer be tolerated. We need to be clear that the onus is on Saddam Hussein to comply with Iraq’s international obligations in full and not those who feel threatened by his weapons program.

 Conclusion

 This is, above all, a time to be thinking of the many families seared forever by loss on 11 September 2001, whether in America, Australia or elsewhere around the world.

 The anniversary is a reminder that we live in a difficult and dangerous world that often makes great and even unreasonable demands of us.

 It is a time to ensure we have learned from the experience and are more committed than ever to avoiding a reoccurrence.

 But it is also a reminder that there are many reasons for hope. The spirit of the rescue workers and the inhabitants of New York and the Pentagon. The resilience of our communities. The courage and professionalism of our military forces. The skill and dedication of our law enforcement and intelligence officials. And the strength not only of our alliance but also of the enduring friendship between the peoples of Australia and the United States.

 Thank you for inviting me to address you on what has become a special day of remembrance.
