  LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

  

  TRANSCRIPT 
OF DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,

  24 NOVEMBER 
1999

  

  E & OE - Proof Only

  

  Subjects: East Timor levy, 
refugees

  

  JOURNALIST:

  Mr Beazley, the taxpayers' associations are now saying 
that this is unfair, costing taxpayers, it should be paid for by big 
business. What's your reaction to that?

  BEAZLEY:

  Look, we support the troops, therefore we support 
the levy. We understand that the levy is necessary to ensure that they 
get the financial support that they need. So, it's acceptable to us 
from that point of view. But it needs to be clearly understood that 
the only reason why this is being charged is that John Howard's GST 
package has punched a $6 billion hole in that year's Budget surplus. 
There'd have been plenty of money to pay for it if we weren't in this 
situation of having to handle the GST. But that's water under the bridge 
now. It's obviously much better that increases in the Medicare levy, 
in any particular circumstances, ought to be devoted to dealing with 
the crises in the public hospitals. But, as a mechanism with some degree 
of fairness in it for providing the necessary funds for the troops, 
it's an acceptable outcome for us.

  JOURNALIST:

  Is it fair, though, that they're targeting a specific 
area of income tax?

  BEAZLEY:

  You can't actually describe people on $50,000 a year 
as rich. It's never been an expression we've applied to it. But, you 
know, John Howard, in his usual straw man erection of issues, has conveyed 
that once some time ago, as you'll remember. So, it's middle Australia 
bearing the burden. It's also middle Australia who bears the burden 
of the GST, it has to be said. But the troops are in the field now. 
And the troops have to be supported.

  JOURNALIST:

  There are some questions from defence analysts that 
the extra two battalions are not needed. Is that your assessment?

  BEAZLEY:

  I think it's very important that the Government focuses 
on how it uses the Reserves, how it uses call-out legislation, and draws 
heavily, for temporary full-time service, on those who are prepared 
to commit themselves to the Reserves. I think that maximises Government 
flexibility. I said that in my statement yesterday, and it did seem 
to me the Government was going to take some notice of it. I hope they 
do.

  JOURNALIST:

  What would you like to see in next year's White Paper 
on the Defence force?

  BEAZLEY:

  In the end, Australia always has to have a capital 
intensive Defence force. We are a small nation. We have a very, very 
big border. And, in the maritime approaches, we cover an even larger 
area of the earth's surfaces. We are never going to be able to deal 
with the defence needs of Australia from manpower intensive areas. It's 
always going to have to be capital intensive. So, as this crisis recedes, 
the issues related to the capital equipment associated with the Defence 
forces are going to come forward. And we face a bow wave of obsolescence 
over the course of the next decade which we're going to have to deal 
with. So, I would say that, after Timor, the emphasis will switch off 
ground forces towards the acquisition of equipment, and that is why 
it would be useful to have flexibility.

  JOURNALIST:

  Do you concede the cleverness of John Howard's policy, 
though. It does seem to be appealing somewhat to a sector of the sentiment 
to help...

  BEAZLEY:

  Well, you have to pay for any commitment you put 
overseas. There's no question about that. You have to pay for any additional 
expenditures that you do. The uncleverness in John Howard's position 
is he slashed the public sector so hard that essential services are 
now in serious trouble. Our hospitals are in crisis. Our universities 
are in crisis. Our schools are in crisis because of John Howard. Now, 
John Howard knows he can't push them further into crisis. He knows that 
that $6 billion hole that he's punched in the Budget surplus with his 
GST package has strained the limits of tax cuts as far as they can go. 
Now, that is an appalling situation. But it's a situation we have to 
deal with. It is, to a certain extent, water under the bridge until 
we handle it at the next Federal election. But he knows darn well that 
the crisis that he has induced in universities and hospitals is going 
to have to be fixed and he can't simply keep cutting away at them in 
order to pay for this commitment. He's got no choices.

  JOURNALIST:

  And what does it mean for the business tax package? 
The Democrats seem to be more confident, before they entered talks last 
night, that there would be the money to pay for all the changes...

  BEAZLEY: 

  I don't really know what the Democrats' position 
is on this. But, I tell you, ours is pretty simple. We're quite happy 
to see this business tax package go through. We've made that amply clear. 
But in one circumstance. And I would have thought that yesterday's events 
amply pointed out that we are right. And that is, the business tax package 
must go through on the revenue-neutral basis that Costello promised, 
and that the additional tax avoidance measures that are being used to 
fund the GST-associated tax cuts go through as well. Now, we want assurances 
from the Government on this. We know the Government is very divided, 
particularly in the area of what might happen to family trusts. And 
so, therefore, we don't trust them. We want to see very clearly what 
it is that they intend to do because we think there is a question mark 
over Costello's ability to deliver. But remove those question marks 
and, as far as we're concerned, the business tax package goes through. 
Costello doesn't have a problem.

  JOURNALIST:

  There's quite a few question marks, though.

  BEAZLEY:

  Over whether or not he's going to deliver on the 
revenue side? Well, quite clearly, there are, yes.

  JOURNALIST:

  Mr Beazley, the Government is projecting boots on 
the ground in Timor until 2002/2003. Do you think that will be the end 
of the operation? Or do you imagine some sort of a military presence 
beyond those years?

  BEAZLEY:

  I think we should keep an open mind on that matter. 
The point is to do the job effectively. That's what has to be done. 
An awful mess has been created in the course of this year. You know, 
I saw John Howard out there the other night talking about how his hands 
were tied and, yet again, erecting another straw man by saying that 
that mess and mayhem which he concealed from the Australian people - 
or his true knowledge of it concealed from the Australian people for 
six months - could not have been answered by an invasion of Indonesia, 
as though that was ever an option. The option was to use the information 
that he had to persuade the Americans and others in the international 
community to pressure Indonesia in a way Australia could not on its 
own. The fact of the matter is, his people actually acted against doing 
that, despite the information they had, and that's made the mess worse. 
I mean, the record this year, when historians come to examine it, is 
going to reflect very ill on John Howard, Alexander Downer and this 
Government. But we move on now. We have to deal with the situation that 
we now confront. And we have a major interest in ensuring the best possible 
outcome in Timor.

  JOUR  NALIST:

  There's been some fairly strong criticism of the 
Labor Party on the front page of one of the Sydney papers this morning. 
Do you concede that the Labor Party has perhaps sold out on some of 
the left side of politics, and they're undermined on things like the 
boat people policy...

  BEAZLEY:

  I saw the article. It was just weird and sad.

  JOURNALIST:

  You don't think that the change in policy on boat 
people is a dramatic shift for Labor?

  BEAZLEY:

  No. It's something similar to what we did ourselves 
at one point of time. Look, I'm a high population man because I don't 
think we can support our elderly people or provide dynamism in the Australian 
economy if we just simply sit down and accept the rapid aging of our 
population. But an essential underpinning of that is that we get to 
choose who comes into this country, what their qualifications are and 
that our very generous refugee program associated with that choice is 
kept effective and unsullied. Even with that three year limitation, 
it is still very generous, by international standards, very generous 
treatment of refugees. And the truth of the matter is that if any person 
who comes in under it faces the serious prospect of internment or death 
on return to country of origin, they will, of course, stay in this country. 
So, from that point of view, we're not worried about it. But, as a Party 
- or as a politician, in my case - is arguing the need for changing 
that naturally occurring aging process of our population, by measures 
which include the possibility of bringing in people to this country…to 
advocate that that should happen in some uncontrolled way would be absurd. 
But I don't see how that fits any of the agendas that Margo is talking 
about.

  Ends
