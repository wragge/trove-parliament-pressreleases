  Dems welcome ALP support for allowing Kosovo 
refugees to stay

  

  The Democrats have always opposed forcing the Kosovar Albanian refugees 
to leave agai nst their will, said Senator Andrew Bartlett the 
Democrats’ immigration spokesperson.

  

 “The Prime Minister was there welcoming the refugees 
at the airport when they arrived. Will he be there waving them goodbye 
if they are forcibly deported?” asked Senator Bartlett.

  

 “The Government created a new class of refugee visa 
for the 4,000 Kosovo Albanians refugees specifically to give the Government 
the legal standing to remove them at a future time,” said Senator 
Bartlett.

  

 “These refugees have ‘use-by’ dates. Presently 
haven is temporary and they are not allowed to apply for permanent residency 
unless they first leave Australia again. It is unacceptable that their 
fate is at the mercy of the immigration Minister without right of appeal.”

  

 The Democrats welcomed Federal Opposition calls to 
allow the refugees to stay in Australia. More than half the refugees 
at Sydney’s East Hills Safe Haven have said they want to stay.
