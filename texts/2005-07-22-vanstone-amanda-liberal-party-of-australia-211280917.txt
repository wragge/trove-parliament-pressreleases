 SA Public Advocate 

 VPS 091/2005

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, today rejected claims made by the South Australian Public  Advocate, Mr John Harley, concerning the health care for immigration detainees and former detainees.

 ‘Despite Mr Harley’s assertions, mental health services at Glenside provided for immigration detainees, or people who are on a Residence  Determination, are paid for by the Commonwealth. For those with a Removal Pending Bridging Visa or a substantive visa, medical costs are  covered by Medicare,’ Senator Vanstone said. 

 The Minister said Mr Harley, having raised the issue of mental health services, invites questions in relation to his own conduct.

 ‘In February, media around Australia reported that Mr Harley had made repeated efforts to convey to DIMIA his concerns for Ms Rau,’ the  Minister said.

 ‘Mr Harley conducted a number of interviews and the reports flowed around Australia. Following this wide publicity, Mr Harley privately admitted  to me that he had made no contact with DIMIA officials prior to Ms Rau’s move to Glenside. None at all!

 ‘Given his responsibilities as Public Advocate, and his publicly declared concerns for Ms Rau’s well being, it would be appropriate for Mr Harley  to reveal the steps he took within the SA mental health system to raise his concerns.

 ‘Surely if his office empowers him to approach the Commonwealth with his concerns for Ms Rau, it also empowers him to do the same with South  Australian mental health authorities. 

 ‘Mr Palmer reveals a communication breakdown between Baxter and Glenside in respect to Ms Rau’s treatment. Now the public is entitled to  know whether Mr Harley raised his concerns with SA Mental Health from December when he said he first became aware of Ms Rau or did they  simply not listen to him?

 ‘The Palmer report highlighted failings in the system, we are working hard to correct these failings. If we are to succeed we will all need to step  down from the soap box and get to work,’ Senator Vanstone said.
