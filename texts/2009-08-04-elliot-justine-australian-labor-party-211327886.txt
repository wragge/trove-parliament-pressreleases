 THE HON JUSTINE ELLIOT MP 

 Minister for Ageing   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 

 4 August 2009   

 More Than $15 Million to Support Older People from Non-English Speaking  Backgrounds   

 The Minister for Ageing, Justine Elliot and Member for Maribyrnong, Bill Shorten today  announced more than $15.6 million to fund 77 projects to help older culturally and  linguistically diverse people access aged care services.     

 The $15.6 million over three years is being funded under the Community Partners  Program (CPP) which brings together older people and their carers from culturally and  linguistically diverse communities, connecting them with aged care information and  service providers.    

 Minister Elliot and Parliamentary Secretary Shorten made the announcement at the  Mekong Senior Citizen's Hostel run by the Indochinese Elderly Refugees Association Inc  which will receive $214,228 from the funding announced today to provide support to  elderly Vietnamese people in Brimbank, Maribyrnong and Dandenong.   

 The 2006 Census reported that almost a quarter (22 per cent) of Australian residents  were born overseas.   

 Minister Elliot said this program is an important investment in older Australians from non-English speaking backgrounds.   

 “Older people born overseas or from culturally diverse backgrounds may have more  difficulty finding out about their aged care options, due to language and cultural barriers.    

 “Providing information about culturally appropriate care is essential in improving access  to care and ensuring their healthy and positive ageing.   

 “This Community Partners Program helps aged care providers to offer culturally  sensitive aged care services, offers training projects, information sessions and the  development of resources,” Minister Elliot said.    

 Parliamentary Secretary Shorten said: “Making sure older Australians have access to  information on culturally appropriate aged care services is very important.   

 “We are a diverse society and we are committed to making sure we provide the right  services at the right time regardless of a person’s background.   

 “The Australian Government is committed to supporting multicultural communities to  overcome any additional barriers they may face in accessing aged care services.    

 “The Vietnamese communities living in cities of Brimbank, Maribyrnong and Greater  Dandenong will directly benefit from today’s announcement,” Mr Shorten said.     

 As part of the Minister’s visit to Maribyrnong Minister Elliot and Parliamentary Secretary  Shorten also visited and spoke with residents and staff at the Viva Care centre at Albion  and St Bernadette’s Nursing Home and Hostel at Sunshine North.
