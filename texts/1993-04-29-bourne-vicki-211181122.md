  DEMOCRATS CALL FOR  RECOGNITION OF ERITREA 

  The Australian Democrats today called on the Australian Government to  officially recognise Eritrea as an independent and sovereign state. 

  Foreign Affairs Spokesperson for the Democrats, Senator Vicki Bourne,  congratulated the people of Eritrea on their overwhelming vote in favour of  independence. 

  Senator Bourne said ''Many Australians have a special respect for the people of  Eritrea and their long and brave struggle for freedom. 

  "As a practic~ recognition of that respect the Australian Government should  recognise Eritrea's independence and commit Australia to provide development  and fo()d aid, which will be crucial to the new nation. · 

  "Eritrea's already woefully inadequate resources, especially food, will be further  strained by the expected return of hundreds of thousands of refugees and exiles,  who number approximately 750,000. 

  "When Eritrean independence is declared on May 24, 1993, the practical goodwill  of the people of Australia should be extended to the people of Eritrea. 

  "With Eritrean independence, the difficulties of Australian government aid will be  alleviated. 

  "Australia must join the United States and Italy which have already announced  their intention to fol'lllally recognise Eritrea."
