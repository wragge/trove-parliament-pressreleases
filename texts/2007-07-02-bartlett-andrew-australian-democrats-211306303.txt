 SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT  Queensland Democrat Senator  QUEENSLAND’S ONLY INDEPENDENT VOICE IN THE SENATE 

 

 Ombudsman’s report shows Immigration laws need changing   

 Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett said that the release of the Immigration  Ombudsman’s final report into the long-term detention of 247 people shows the government has failed to  adequately reform our immigration system and laws.    

 “The Immigration Department may have had a name change and some restructuring, but the laws and policies  which lie at the heart of the problems in the place are the same,” Senator Bartlett said.    

 “This latest Ombudsman’s report isn’t just a litany of past stuff-ups; it’s a testament to continuing cruelty  towards asylum seekers.    

 “The only way to prevent ongoing mistreatment and prevent unnecessary suffering is to reform the law.   

 “I have put forward a series of Private Senator’s Bills to make the necessary changes to prevent this suffering,  ongoing abuse and absurd expense to the taxpayer but these Bills need government support.   

 “The fact that the Ombudsman is bringing such a comprehensive report on the poor treatment of people in  detention is the strongest evidence you will need to show that change to the law is a matter of priority.   

 “Cultural deficiencies within the Department can’t be combated without the appropriate changes to the  government’s policy and our laws.   

 “I call on the government to heed the Ombudsman’s latest report and undertake the necessary reforms rather  than tinkering around the edges,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
