 Windsor wins top MP Award for second time    

 The  community  advocate  organisation  FairGO  has  awarded  its  “Best  MP”,  for  the  second   time in a row, to the Independent Member for New England, Tony Windsor.   

 Mr  Windsor  was  announced  today  as  the  most  helpful  Federal  Member  of  Parliament  in   responding to a wide range of issues which had been forwarded by the FairGO organisation  on behalf of concerned citizens to every MP in Australia during the last Parliamentary term.   

 Mr Windsor is honoured to have achieved this award for the second time, expressing again  that it was very important that individuals in the community should have the right to be heard  by their elected representatives in relation to issues of concern.   

 “I would like to thank my staff for their diligence and hard work in assisting me in my role as  the  Member  for  New  England  and  I  commend  FairGO  Director,  Greg  Bloomfield,  for  his   ongoing efforts over the past 21 years to help bring the community’s concerns to the attention  of Parliamentarians across Australia,” Mr Windsor said. 

 

 The following is a transcript of a media release issued by FairGO

 Star Performing Federal Politicians 2004 - 2007   

 Before  every  federal  election  since  the  early  90's,  politically  independent  community   advocate  FairGO  has  assessed  the  performance  of  each  member  of  parliament  since  the   previous election. This gauges real, tough, performance over a three year period, not the six  week hype of pre-election "promises".

 It rates MPs on how well they respond to voters' queries, complaints and issues. FairGO can  compare  all  politicians  equally  because,  for  21  years  it  has  enabled  voters  to  communicate   simultaneously with all politicians by Votergram. So when a voter seeks help or a change in 

 policy, every politician has an equal chance of assisting.   

 FairGO  advocates  "Value  based  voting".  That  is,  voting  with  the  objective  of  gaining   maximum value for the voters from the hundreds of politicians they elect. This differs from  the old method of people voting for their favourite party or leader, regardless of performance 

 by  individual  MPs.  FairGO  claims  that  just  voting  for  parties  or  leaders  encourages   "democratic  dictatorship"  where  one  party  boss  or  leader  alone  virtually  rules  parliament.   Most of the other 200 politicians don't count.  

 

 This FairGO assessment of Star Political Performers respects and highlights the importance  of  every  local  representative  and  senator  in  our  democratic  government  being  a  good   performer for the people.   

 Some  elected  politicians  are  outstandingly  good  at  helping  voters  get  the  democracy  they   want.  Others  are  not  interested  or  are  too  lazy  to  even  consider  the  views  of  Australians   outside  their  own  electorates,  though  they  are  very  happy  to  listen  to  political  donors,   lobbyists and powerful vested interests from outside their electorates.   

 The range of issues covered by voters is detailed later.    

 HERE  ARE  THE  NAMES  OF  THE  STAR  FEDERAL  POLITICAL   PERFORMERS  DURING  THE  LAST  PARLIAMENTARY  TERM  OF   OFFICE FROM 2004 TO 2007:-   

 Overall winner, Star Political Performer of the whole federal Parliament, for the second  time  running,  is  New  England  Independent  Mr.  Tony  Windsor,  who  was  twice  as   responsive as the next best MPs. Mr. Windsor's willingness to address issues raised by voters  from all over Australia and make government ministers accountable for their actions on those  issues was outstanding, according to FairGO Director, Mr. Greg Bloomfield.   

 "Again and again Mr. Windsor has taken up voters views and queries with federal and state  ministers, seeking explanations and changes", said Mr. Bloomfield. "Mr. Windsor has taken  up  causes  and  given  voters  a  real  voice  from  his  seat  in  Parliament.  He  has  particularly   assisted  voters  who  have  raised  with  him  questions  on  child  care  funding,  alcohol  health   labelling, road safety, citizenship, parenting, debt forgiveness for African nations, fuel prices,  migration and refugees, appropriate anti-terror laws and a fair trial for David Hicks. He has  helped those wanting better rail transport, funding for autistic children, maximum benefits for  Australia  out  of  the  US  Free   Trade  Agreement  and  better  protection  from  crime.  Mr.   Windsor is a unique politician, the dream of all who believe in democracy as "government of  the people, by the people, for the people". He works very hard to do his duty for the people of  Australia. FairGO salutes this superb effort, now covering a six year period in parliament."   

 Runner up  with  a  very  creditable  performance  herself,  was Australian  Democrats leader  Sen.  Lyn  Allison.  Voters  from  all  over  the  country  have  valued  her  assistance  on  many   issues,  particularly  mental  health,  refugees  and  migration,  parenting,  child  care  funding,   alcohol labelling, the environment, debt forgiveness, anti-terror laws and fair trial for David  Hicks.  A  very  consistent  advocate  for  voters,  Sen.  Allison  has  risen  from  4th  best  Political   Performer in the 2004 ratings to 2nd place in 2007.

 Third  placed  performer  out  of  the  200  plus  federal  politicians,  was  another  Australian  Democrat, Sen. Natasha Stott Despoja, squeezed out of the second place she held in 2004,  by  her  colleague  and  leader,  Sen.  Allison.  Sen.  Stott  Despoja  became  a  mother  during  this   parliamentary term and will retire next June to devote more time to her family, so a move into  3rd place in 2007 is perhaps understandable.    

 Following Mr. Windsor as second and third best Star Political Performers in the Federal  House of Representatives were Ms. Tanya Plibersek (Labor) 2nd, just ahead of her leader  Mr. Kevin Rudd in 3rd place out of 147 MPs. 

 

 Third  best  out  of  the  76  senators,   following  Senators  Allison  and  Stott  Despoja  was   Greens Leader Sen. Bob Brown.   

 Three  other  senators  put  in  significant  performances  helping  voters.  They  were  Senators   Humphries and Payne (Liberal) and Senator Moore (Labor).    

 In  the  House  of  Representatives  Liberal  Defence  Minister  Dr.  Brendan  Nelson  showed   interest in some issues, mainly touching his portfolio or electorate.   

 Other Members of Parliament who responded well for Australian voters everywhere were, in  alphabetical order:-  Hon. Tony Abbott (Lib)  Hon. John Anderson (Nats)  Late Mr. Peter Andren (Ind)  Hon. Kevin Andrews (Lib)  Hon Bob Baldwin (Lib)  Mr. Andrew Bartlett (Dem)  Hon. Bruce Bilson (Lib)  Hon. Julie Bishop (Lib)  Mr. Russell Broadbent (Lib)  Hon. Mal Brough (Lib)  Hon. John Cobb (Nats)  Hon Peter Costello (Lib)  Hon. Alexander Downer (Lib)  Hon Peter Dutton (Lib)  Sen. Hon John Faulkner (ALP)  Mr. Martin Ferguson (ALP)  Sen. Steve Fielding (Fam)  Sen. Concetta Fierravanti-Wells (Lib)  Ms. Jennie George (ALP)  Mr. Petro Georgiou (Lib)  Mr. Steve Gibbons (ALP)  Ms. Julia Gillard (ALP)  Hon. Greg Hunt (Lib)  Dr. Dennis Jensen (Lib)  Sen Barnaby Joyce (Nats)  Sen. Ross Lightfoot (Lib)  Mr. Peter Lindsay (Lib)  Mrs. Louise Markus (Lib)  Sen. Jan McLucas (ALP)

 Sen. Brett Mason (Lib)  Sen Christine Milne (Grn)  Hon. Judith Moylan (Lib)  Sen. Fiona Nash (Nats)  Sen. Stephen Parry (Lib)  Sen. Hon.

 These are the 50 most responsive Members of Federal Parliament when it comes to ordinary  voters living anywhere in Australia.    

 Although  elected  and  paid  by  the  Australian  people  as  a  whole,  many  of  the  remaining   federal MPs  were not interested in ideas, issues or complaints raised by anyone who did not  vote for them, act as a paid lobbyist or donate to them or their party.   

 The  issues  raised  by  Australian  voters  through  FairGO's  Votergrams  over  the  4  year   period were :-  â¢ Affordable housing  â¢ African nation debt forgiveness  â¢ Appropriate health warnings on alcohol containers   â¢ Autism specific pre-school funding  â¢ Australian Government corporation bribes to Saddam Hussein's administration  â¢ BCOF veterans entitlements  â¢ Hospital care and safety crisis  â¢ Child care and pre-school funding  â¢ Citizenship  â¢ Crime prevention  â¢ Disability services  â¢ Domestic violence  â¢ False information circulated to doctors and patients by government authorities and refusal 

 to correct same.  â¢ Fair trial for David Hicks  â¢ Family law reform  â¢ Fuel prices, fuel taxes and price rise since the Iraq invasion  â¢ Iraq invasion, war and death toll  â¢ Media that is honest and balanced in reporting  â¢ Mental health services failing to provide necessary care.  â¢ Migration and fair treatment of genuine refugees  â¢ MPs' resources for servicing voters  â¢ Overseas disaster aid  â¢ Parenting  â¢ Political influence that is kept secret  â¢ Public transport  â¢ Preserving remnant urban bushland ….5/
