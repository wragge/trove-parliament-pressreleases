 From the Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs. .. THE HON JOHN HODGES,

 F e bruary 1983

 A U D I O - V I S U A L  SE R I E S  LAUNCHED

 An audio-visual series called "Neighbourhood Living",  aimed at helping migrants 

 and refugees settle into the community, will be launched in Melbourne on 

 Monday, by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, John Hodges.

 The launching will be held at Collingwood Education Centre, theatrette 

 Vere Street, Collingwood, at 10.45 a.m. '  .

 The series will give new arrivals information about living in suburban 

 Australia. The series, produced on videotape by Film Australia, covers 

 topics such as "garbage do’s and don *  ts ", renting, tenancy pitfalls, 

 immunisation programs and community services.

 The tapes will be available in seven community languages - Vietnamese, Khmer,

 Lao, Cantonese, Polish, Spanish and Arabic - and written material will be 

 available for viewers to take away after they have seen the tapes. ·

 Migrant Resource Centres, migrant centres and regional offices of the Department 

 of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will have copies of the videotapes, to be 

 shown or lent to migrants and refugees.

 Mr Hodges said the series grew out of the Fairfield (NSW) Council's concern 

 at the lack of knowledge in the community about the role played by local 

 government and the services it offered.

 "A bonus in making the series has been the positive contribution it has made to 

 fostering harmony in the community. Film Australia reported almost overwhelming 

 co-operation from the people of Fairfield.

 "I believe that the "Neighborhood Living" series is a 

 significant addition to a broad range of services available to 

 new settlers through the Department of Immigration and Ethnic 

 Affairs, and through state and local government.

 "All these services recognise that people arriving in Australia 

 from different cultural environments face needs which arise 

 directly from their status as migrants and refugees.

 "The Neighborhood Living" series is a welcome addition to the 

 services provided to meet these needs."
