 Media Release  20 January 2010  

 Prime Minister  

 Minister for Health and Ageing  

 South Australian Minister for Health  

 Building the GP Plus Super Clinic Network  

 Adelaide  

 The Prime Minister, Federal Minister for Health and the South Australian  Minister for Health today announced the appointment of the construction  firms who will build the $25 million Modbury GP Plus Super Clinic and  Noarlunga GP Super Clinic. Work will soon commence, with the first stage of  the Noarlunga clinic complete in September of this year, and the first stage of  the Modbury clinic finished the following month. 

 Artist impressions were released today of the main Modbury clinic at Tea Tree  Plaza which will have a floor space of 2,558 square metres and will also  include a new four level car park. 

 GP Plus centres allow people to receive care close to home, with a range of  services including specialist clinics, physiotherapy, chronic disease  management and after-hours GP clinics. 

 The Modbury centre - which will be located on two sites on Smart Road and  Gilles Crescent - will boost health services available to residents of Adelaide's  north eastern suburbs. It will have five GP consulting rooms, two clinical  treatment rooms, six specialist clinic rooms, nine allied health clinic rooms,  fourteen dental chairs, plus meeting and training space. 

 Adelaide UniCare will provide GP services at the clinic with a focus on patients  without a GP, patients with chronic health problems, older and disadvantaged  people and indigenous, refugee and migrant groups. 

 The Noarlunga GP Plus Super Clinic will be built between the Noarlunga  hospital and Health Village. It will have five GP consulting rooms, 5 minor  procedure rooms and 25 specialists' consulting rooms for services including  child health, chronic disease programs, mental health and sexual health.

 Dental services will also be available, along with an Aboriginal Health service  with four consulting rooms. 

 The two $25 million centres are the result of a partnership between the  Commonwealth and State Governments signed last year by the Prime  Minister and SA Health Minister John Hill. 

 The Prime Minister said: "GP Super Clinics are essential to building a  stronger, more effective primary health care system. Their focus on keeping  people healthier for longer is an essential part of improving the health  outcomes for all Australians." 

 Health Minister Nicola Roxon added, "These clinics are part of Government's  strategy to help address the growing need in South Australia for access to  affordable, high quality, comprehensive and integrated primary care services  which are convenient and accessible. 

 "These new clinics will help ensure South Australians have access to the  health care they need, where and when they need it," she said. 

 Minister Hill says "GP Plus centres are set to be a cornerstone of our primary  health system. 

 "They're good for patients, who can get treatment at convenient, modern and  family-friendly centres. 

 "They're also good for the whole health system as their focus on keeping  people healthy and out of hospital also frees up capacity in our busy  Emergency Departments." 

 Construction of the first stage at Tea Tree Gully begins this month and will be  complete in October 2010, with the second stage to be complete by October  2011. The Gilles Plains site will be constructed from April 2010 to May 2011. 

 Following rigorous tendering processes, the contract to build the Modbury GP  Plus Centre has been awarded to Badge Constructions SA Pty Ltd, while the  contract to build the Noarlunga GP Plus Super Clinic has been awarded to  Hansen Yuncken Pty Ltd. 

 The Australian Government is also partnering with Adelaide UniCare on a

 $7.5 million Super Clinic at Playford North. 

 GP Plus Health Care Centres have already been opened at Aldinga and  Woodville, and two more are being built in Marion and Elizabeth. 

 GP Super Clinics deliver on an election commitment of the Rudd Government  to provide primary health care services where they are most needed. $275  million has been allocated to establish 36 GP Super Clinics in communities  right around the country.
