 2012 shaping up as another good year for people  smuggling

 Posted on Wednesday, 25 January, 2012

 Another illegal vessel was intercepted of Christmas Island today, carrying 56 passengers and two  crew, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said today. 

 "This just reinforces to the Australian people that Julia Gillard and her Labor Government has  completely lost control of our borders," Mr Keenan said. 

 "With nearly 15 000 illegal arrivals since Labor abolished the proven immigration policies of the  Howard Government, it is time for the Gillard Government to swallow their pride and immediately take  action to restore control." 

 "When Julia Gillard knifed Kevin Rudd to seize the job of Prime Minister she nominated border  protection as one of the reasons that Labor had "lost its way" and she vowed to take Australia on a  different course. 

 "Since then she has adopted almost all possible policy positions except the one that we actually know  works," he said. 

 "Labor has done everything it can to highlight its weakness and lack of resolve which has given an  enormous green light to people smugglers" 

 "They know that when they test this Government they always win and this only gives them further  reason to continue this evil trade" 

 "Only when we see a return to offshore processing, temporary protection visas and turning the boats  back around when it is safe to do so, will we see an end to this continued influx of boats" Mr Keenan  said.
