 Bring asylum seekers to the mainland   

 21.11.05 

 

 Australian  Greens  Senator  Kerry  Nettle  called  on  the  Government   to  bring  seven  recently  arrived  Timorese  asylum  seekers  to  the   mainland  for  processing  and  questioned  whether  the  Government   had changed its policy on the use of the Christmas Island detention  centre.   

 “The  Senate  Inquiry  into  Migration  has  heard  a  mountain  of   evidence  about  why  remote  detention  centres  are  bad  for  people’s   mental health and their ability to get legal representation.  

 

 "To re-open Christmas Island for seven people must have cost many  thousands  of  taxpayers  dollars.  The  government  initially  told  us   these people were not seeking protection and it turns out they are.    This  move  appears  to  be  all  about  hiding  an  embarrassment  from   the public.    

 “It  seems  the  Government  has  changed  its  policy  on  the  use  of  the    Christmas  Island  Detention  Centre.  In  April  this  year,  Senator   Vanstone’s  spokesperson  said  it  would  only  be  ‘used  for   unauthorised arrivals who arrive in areas that are excised from the  migration zone and there’s no plans to change that’.  Now they are  taking these people there even though they clearly made it onto the  Australian shore.    

 The Government's mandatory detention policy is a political, ethical  and financial debacle." Senator Nettle said.
