 PACIFIC STRATEGY CASELOAD ALMOST 80 PER CENT FINALISED   

 Following  the  voluntary  return  home  of  failed  asylum  seekers  and  the  resettlement  of   other  refugees  from  Nauru,  almost  80  per  cent  of  the  caseload  from  the  offshore   processing centres has now been resolved, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural  and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, announced today.   

 “Of the more than 15-hundred people accommodated in the offshore processing centres  in Nauru and Papua New Guinea, only 356 remain,” Mr Ruddock said.   

 “The  ongoing  resolution  of  this  caseload  signifies  yet  again  the  success  of  the   Government’s Pacific Strategy.   

 “We have had no unauthorised boat arrivals for almost two years with the exception of  the Vietnamese in July, and that has been a remarkable outcome.   

 “Looking  back  at  the  events  of  the  past  few  years  it  is  clear  that  we  have  potentially   saved  hundreds  of  lives  —  people  who,  prior  to  the  Pacific  Strategy, may  have  got  on   unseaworthy vessels for a life threatening journey to Australia.   

 “We continue to balance our commitment to the international protection system and while  maintaining the integrity of our borders and migration programs,” Mr Ruddock said.   

 Voluntary returns from both Manus and Nauru had reached 446, following the departure  of 27 people — 17 Afghans and10 Iraqis — from Nauru last week.   

 Of  the  returnees,  17  (all  Afghans)  took  advantage  of  the  Australian  Government   reintegration package. The remainder received financial assistance from the International  Organization for Migration.   

 In  addition  and  in  keeping  with  Australia’s  undertaking  to  share  the  burden  for   resettlement, a further 21 refugees from Nauru have been transferred to Australia.   

 The refugees arriving in Brisbane, comprised 16 Afghans, three Iraqi nationals and two  Palestinians.   

 This  brings  the  total  number  of  refugees  resettled  in  Australia  from  the  offshore   processing centres in Manus and Nauru to 352.     

 “I expect that the situation for the remaining refugees will be resolved in the near future,”  Mr Ruddock said.
