 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS 

 The Hon Julie Bishop MP 

 

 18 February 2015 

 

 AUSTRALIA TEAMS UP WITH ANZ IN THE PACIFIC   

 Today I signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with ANZ Chief Executive  Officer Mike Smith, which will boost Australian Government efforts to enhance  economic growth in the Pacific region.   

 The MoU with the Australian Government and ANZ creates a partnership that will  significantly improve access to finance for many Pacific Islanders and enable them to  participate in the formal economy, in some cases for the first time.   

 The agreement outlines priority areas for joint cooperation between the Department of  Foreign Affairs and Trade and ANZ in the Pacific, including:   

 - financial inclusion, literacy and the economic empowerment of women  - innovative approaches to finance for small to medium businesses  - opportunities for joint financing of infrastructure projects, and  - more effective and timely communication on disaster and crisis relief.   

 Working with ANZ, the Australian Government can more effectively assist Pacific  communities to better manage their finances, start small businesses, save money and  empower women to participate in the formal banking system.   

 The MoU is an important step toward government, business and the development  sector working together to drive economic growth and assist Pacific communities to  work toward financial independence.   

 Private sector engagement in Australia's aid program means our development  assistance can be provided more effectively, efficiently and innovatively.
