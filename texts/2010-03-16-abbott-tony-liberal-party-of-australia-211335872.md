 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   DOORSTOP INTERVIEW   PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA

 E&OE……………………….………………………………………………………………………………..   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 The situation on our borders is getting worse. We’ve had 24 boats arrive since the beginning of the year,  almost 1,200 people. This is a classic case of failure by the Rudd Government. The Howard Government  found a problem in this area. It carved out a solution. Mr Rudd found that solution and he’s created a  problem. The problem is just getting worse.    

 We’re getting 10 boats a month at the moment. It’s the highest rate of boat arrival in our history. It’s all  started because Mr Rudd wanted to parade his compassion credentials before sections of the Australian  population. But it’s part of a pattern of failure.    

 This is a government that is chronically incapable of delivering sound government. It’s failed on border  protection. It’s monumentally and tragically failed on the home insulation programme. It’s failed to deliver  good value to taxpayers with the so called Building the Education Revolution programme. Now of course  it’s a government that wants to reform public hospitals, the same people who gave us the pink batts disaster,  who’ve lost control of our borders, expect us to believe that they can fix public hospitals.    

 The problem is that Mr Rudd cannot focus on problems and he cannot deliver solutions and his incapacity to  control our borders is the latest classic example of this.   

 QUESTION:   

 [inaudible] plan for regional hospitals, what would you do differently to what the Government’s proposing?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, if the Government was serious about sorting out the hospital problem it would go to the immediate  difficulties and the immediate difficulties are chronic bureaucracy, particularly in New South Wales and  Queensland, and that would be solved by local hospital boards in those two states. The other big problem is  the chronic lack of beds and that would be solved by a rapid substantial injection of new beds. They’re the

 problems in our hospitals and that’s what we need. We don’t need Mr Rudd’s medicine which is a great big  new bureaucracy. A great big new bureaucracy which will just continue the mismanagement.    

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott why do you think voters are turning their backs on Kevin Rudd?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I think that the more they see of the current Government the less they like it. I think over time there might  even be some nostalgia for the former government. I think that people are starting to see the inner bully in  Mr Rudd. I think that footage of him giving Kristina Keneally the cold shoulder in every sense last week has  been very damaging for Mr Rudd, particularly on top of the temper tantrum he had with the RAAF flight  attendant last year. I think people are getting to know the Prime Minister and what they’re discovering is  that there’s not that much there.    

 QUESTION:   

 The problems in our health system aren’t something that have just happened in the last two years, so  obviously you resided over Health Minister before that, do you think that you did everything in your power  and everything you could to improve the health system?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I’m not saying that everything went swimmingly when I was the Health Minister. But certainly the federally  run parts of our health system were working pretty well under the Howard Government and yes, we were  about to start tackling the public hospital system when we lost office. But I think if you ask any credible,  serious health professional about the stewardship of different ministers over the health system, I think that  my record would emerge pretty well.   

 QUESTION:   

 Has the Coalition back-flipped on its support for the racial discrimination act?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 No, no, the Coalition supports the principle of welfare quarantining, that’s what we support. Now, we would  prefer that the Government didn’t unwind welfare quarantining in the 73 remote Northern Territory  communities, but we’re pleased that the Government is proposing to extend automatic welfare quarantining  more widely, initially throughout the Northern Territory, but eventually at least to certain categories and  beneficiaries right around Australia.    

 Now, this is a positive change. It’s a change for the better and that’s why even though it involves one step  back in one area, it involves at least one and a half steps forward in another area and that’s why I’m inclined,  subject to party room processes, to try to amend the bill, but if that can’t be done to support the bill.   

 QUESTION:   

 You say your record as Health Minister was good but didn’t you chop a $1 billion out of the public health  system?

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 This is an absolute lie. It’s a complete lie and it’s a symptom of the fact that Mr Rudd is so ethically  challenged when it comes to his political presentation that he keeps repeating this lie. The Coalition  Government constantly increased funding for public hospitals. At one stage there was an adjustment to the  forward estimates but the actual quantum of funding for public hospitals constantly increased, massively  increased over the term of the Howard Government, as all credible observers acknowledge.   

 QUESTION:   

 John Howard seems to think that your response…that he’s responsible for you being the Liberal leader  today, would you agree with that assessment?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 John Howard certainly has been a giant of Australian politics and after Menzies by far the most significant  figure in the Liberal Party’s history. I regard him as a great friend and a great mentor. He’s certainly been a  great teacher to me and I look forward to enjoying his counsel and friendship for many years to come.   

 QUESTION:   

 This morning a Labor backbencher said that Julia Gillard was Kevin Rudd’s obvious successor, do you think  that she would do a better job?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Oh, I think there’s no doubt that Julia Gillard has an authenticity which the Prime Minister lacks and I think  the public are starting to appreciate that. Look, she’s very left wing. I don’t think she’d be a great Prime  Minister. But there’s something that’s a bit fair dinkum about Julia Gillard which you don’t get with Prime  Minister Rudd.   

 QUESTION:   

 What do you take away from the polls this morning because Kevin Rudd is obviously losing popularity? The  Coalition on a two-party preferred basis isn’t gaining that much ground?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Ah, I try not to pay too much attention to polls. Obviously I have noticed that the Prime Minister’s  popularity is sinking fast. Our challenge is not just to be an effective Opposition but also to be a credible  alternative government and that’s a challenge which I think we’re rising too. But there’s obviously a fair  way to go. Thanks very much.
