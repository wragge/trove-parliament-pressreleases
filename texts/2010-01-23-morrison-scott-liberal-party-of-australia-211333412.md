 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 

 Media Release 

 Two illegal boat arrivals in just twenty four hours  Saturday 23rd January 2010 

 The arrival of two more boats within just 24 hours for the second time this year is further 

 evidence the Rudd Government has lost control of our borders, says Shadow Minister for 

 Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison. 

 Mr Morrison said “under the Rudd Government’s policy, undertaking this hazardous and 

 treacherous voyage has become a certain ticket to permanent residence in Australia. No 

 wonder the boats keep coming. 

 “This is the most dangerous time of year to undertake this hazardous voyage. 

 

 "The illegal arrival of 2 boats within 24 hours for the second time this year, carrying 73 

 passengers defies belief. 

 

 "We have now had 19 illegal boat arrivals so far this during these dangerous summer 

 months, compared to just five this time last year. 

 “Not even the weather can provide a deterrent against the magnetic impact of the 

 Government’s failed border protection policies” he said. 

 “It is time the Rudd Government ended their state of denial on their failed border protection 

 policies where special deals and weakened controls have issued an open invitation to the 

 clients of people smugglers. 

 Seventy five boats have now arrived since the Rudd Government started weakening the 

 border protection regime they inherited from the Coalition Government. 

 “Against the back drop of reports that more than one hundred people may have perished on 

 a boat recently it is time this madness was put to an end. 

 “Mr Rudd must draw himself away from his festival of self congratulation, swallow his pride 

 and accept that his policies have failed and start making some hard decisions on toughening 

 up our border controls. 

 “Australians do not want to see people perish at sea or their borders to be treated as 

 optional by people smugglers. But this is what is taking place under the Rudd Government 

 “It is time for Mr Rudd to face reality. He cannot spin these boats away. He needs to make 

 decisions that will send a message to people smugglers that their business will not succeed 

 in Australia” Mr Morrison said.
