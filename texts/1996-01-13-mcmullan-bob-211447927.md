  Media Release  Bob McMullan Minister for Trade 

  MT9/96 13 January 1996 

  EAST TIMORESE ASYLUM SEEKERS 

  Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob McMullan, confirmed today that the two  East Timorese women who entered the Australian Embassy, Jakarta, on 10 January and  sought "protection and asylum" had left the Embassy on 12 January for Portugal. 

  The International Commission of the Red Cross (JCRC) assisted in arranging for the  departure of the women, as they had done in previous instances .where East Timorese had  entered diplomatic missions in Jakarta. 

  Senator McMullan rejected any suggestions that the women had gone to Portugal other than  of their own free will. 

  "The voluntary nature of the decision of the two women to go to Portugal was independently  verified by the ICRC," Senator McMullan said. 

  "I believe the ICRC's integrity is beyond question. 

  "Neither the Australian nor Portuguese Governments would be party to their travel to  Portugal other than on an absolutely voluntary basis." 

  The Australian Embassy in Jakarta went as far as possible to ensure that the women were  comfortable and well looked after while they were in the Embassy, and to ensure their safety  once they left the Embassy. 

  As a matter of normal practice, the Indonesian authorities were informed that East Timorese  persons were in the Embassy. The Indonesian authorities played no other role than allowing  the East Timorese to depart for Portugal.
