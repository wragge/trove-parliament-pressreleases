 Australia Renews Agreement with People's Republic of China on Returning Illegal Arrivals MPS 051/2000

 International cooperation will continue to play a major role in stemming the illegal flow of people to Australia, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today.

 Mr Ruddock was speaking after the renewal of migration regulations on the 'safe third country' arrangement with the People's Republic of China (PRC).

 "The 'safe third country' arrangement facilitates the return to the PRC of Sino-Vietnamese refugees who have been settled in the PRC and who have subsequently arrived in Australia unlawfully," Mr Ruddock said.

 "This arrangement is based on a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that Australia signed with the PRC on 25 January 1995. Migration Regulations giving force to this agreement have been in place since 1 July 1996 but are reviewed every two years to ensure that the return of these people to the PRC is still appropriate.

 "Consultations with the Canberra Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and investigations by my own department have indicated that Sino-Vietnamese refugees who have been granted protection in the PRC are treated essentially as Chinese nationals," Mr Ruddock said.

 Since 1 July 1996, the MOU has facilitated the return of 915 Sino-Vietnamese to the PRC. In accordance with the MOU, UNHCR is kept informed of progress with returns.

 These arrangements have been extremely successful in sending the message that it is not worth paying a smuggler - only 39 such people have arrived unlawfully in Australia since 11 March 1999.

 "There has been no threat of involuntary return to Vietnam by the PRC and no evidence that returnees have suffered discrimination or persecution on return," Mr Ruddock said.

 "This arrangement demonstrates the strong relationship that Australia has with the PRC and is a good example of the types of arrangements that we are trying to establish with a range of countries to combat the problem of people smuggling," Mr Ruddock said.
