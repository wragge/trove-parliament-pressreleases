 Beazley's Blunders Continue

 MPS 178/2001

 "The Opposition leader continues to suggest that the ALP has some bright ideas about handling unauthorised boat arrivals, however, his statements simply show that he doesn't understand what the Government is currently doing", said Mr Ruddock, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural affairs today.

 Mr Beazley believes that "only the Labor party can stop the boats coming" and he proposes that this can be done by a Coastguard and sending all unauthorised arrivals back to Indonesia.

 The idea of the Coastguard has been condemned by Mr Beazley's own mouth when he dismissed the idea when he was Defence Minister in 1984.

 The Opposition has also failed to detail just what it is that a Coastguard will do that the current arrangements with Coastwatch and the Navy aren't already doing. Current arrangements already detect 98.6% of all boats. Coastwatch is already on duty 365 days a year.

 Mr Beazley says that all the Government has to do is to get an agreement with the Indonesians like the agreement we have with the Chinese.

 We already have such an agreement. The Chinese agree to take back Chinese nationals and the Indonesians agree to take back Indonesian nationals. The Chinese never agreed to take back non-Chinese nationals and the Indonesians are also understandably reluctant to take back non-Indonesian nationals.

 Mr Beazley has failed to recognise that the problem of the Chinese boat people is significantly different to the current problem. Even his colleague and ex-Immigration Minister Senator Ray understood this when he said during the debate on the Border Protection Bills on 26 September,

 "what we have seen emerge over the last few years is not boat people in the traditional way

 but people who have bought passage on a boat."

 The approximately 2000 boat people who arrived in the 20 years to 1985 came directly from their countries of origin - they did not transit third countries except for supplies. They certainly did not pay people smugglers to travel by air through third countries to use Indonesia as a staging post.

 Mr Beazley's comments also failed to recognise that it was the Coalition government that initiated and implemented the Regional Cooperation Agreement with Indonesia whereby the UNHCR and IOM process interdicted asylum seekers for re-settlement.

 Australia has already agreed to take some of those who are granted refugee status through this agreement in a burden sharing arrangement with other countries.

 The ALP is simply parroting what the Coalition is already doing.

 No new ideas here.
