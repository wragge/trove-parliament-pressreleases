 PRIME MINISTER 

 

  CLAIMS BY MR MIKE SCRAFTON 

 

 It is a matter of public record that I did speak to Mr Mike Scrafton on the night of Wednesday 7  November 2001.  I told the House of Representatives of this in answer to a question on 19 February  2002, some 2½ years ago.  I said in that answer that I had spoken to Mr Scrafton entirely about the  video.  This was reported in the media the following day.   

 My sole purpose in ringing him on 7 November 2001 was to obtain his assessment of the video  which he had just viewed.  He gave me a description of the video and expressed the view that it was  inconclusive.   

 I decided that the video should be released.  This occurred the next day.   

 My answer to the House was given more than 2½ years ago.  It has not been disputed by Mr  Scrafton until now.  I have been informed that Mr Scrafton left the employ of the Public Service on  13 December 2003 ie. nine months ago.   

 It is also particularly relevant that on 14 December 2001, in an interview with Ms Jenny Bryant of  the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, who had been appointed to conduct a departmental  inquiry into the matter at my request, Mr Scrafton said " ... that the Prime Minister rang him later  that evening.  He said he spoke to the Prime Minister a couple of times that evening about the tape  and informed him that it was inconclusive".   

 That was the only reference he made in the interview to his discussions with me on 7 November.   He did not refer to the matters mentioned under (b) and (c) in his letter to The Australian newspaper  published today viz that the photographs had been of events on 8 October and that nobody in  Defence believed any longer that children had been thrown overboard.   

 In a follow up question the Bryant Inquiry asked Mr Scrafton: "Do you recall being advised at any  stage that there were no children among those in the water on the 7 October?"  To this question Mr  Scrafton replied "No".   

 A record of the interview of 14 December 2001 was signed by Mr Scrafton on 3 January 2002.  His  response to the above additional question as well as some other specific questions was also signed  on 3 January 2002.     

 Both of the documents signed by Mr Scrafton were made available to the Senate Inquiry.  These  documents are attached.   

 I stand by the previous statements I have made on this matter.
