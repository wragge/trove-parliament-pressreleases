 CHRISTMAS ISLAND BUDGET BLOWS OUT BY $132 MILLION 

 Mr Scott Morrison MP  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 Federal Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison has revealed a $132 million blow out in 

 the Rudd Government’s budget for offshore processing at Christmas Island in parliament.  

 “In the May budget the Rudd Government had allocated $125 million for offshore processing. In the detail of the 

 additional estimates, the government is now asking for another $132 million for this work, an increase of more 

 than 100%,” Mr Morrison said.  

 “In 2009/10 we will now be spending $257 million on this work, $143.7 million or 126% more than last year,” he 

 said.  

 The cost blow outs include:   - An extra $26 million or a 58% increase in payments to contractors  

 - An extra $72 million or a 178% increase for departmental expense  

 - New expenditure of $34 million for capital works, for additional demountable accommodation on the Island. 

 “What is even more extraordinary is that they are budgeting next year for a 38% cut in expenditure in the area. 

 Even keeping the budget at current levels to meet current demand, would mean a budget shortfall of $370m over 

 the next three years. Combined with this year’s blowout, this represents under budgeting by Labor of more than 

 half a billion dollars.  

 “Since July 1 last year, 53 boats have illegally arrived in Australian waters carrying 2,441 passengers to be 

 transferred to Christmas Island. After just seven months, this is more than double the number of boats that 

 arrived in 2008/2009 carrying 1,039 passengers.  

 “The Rudd Government’s answer to their failed border protection polices is just to buy more beds and tents, 

 rather than take tough decisions to stop the boats, as they promised.  

 “The Rudd Government has already rolled over to people smugglers by transferring people to the mainland 

 whose refugee claims have not been determined. Yesterday, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration 

 confirmed they would continue this policy, with Christmas Island being overrun.  

 “The Coalition has made it clear we will not compromise our policy of offshore detention and would seek 

 alternatives in Government if required. While Manus Island and Nauru are now closed and not under 

 consideration, it is the Government’s job to find alternative solutions.  

 “The Rudd Government has gone for the soft option once again and made Australia a soft touch as a result.  

 “Under the Coalition’s policies we had 18 boat arrivals in our last 6 years. The Rudd Government has had 18 

 arrivals in the last 8 weeks. These outcomes speak volumes for the Rudd Government’s border protection 

 failures,” Mr Morrison said.
