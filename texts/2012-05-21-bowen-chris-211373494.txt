 Chris Bowen MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 Another boat as Coalition ignores warnings  Sunday, 20 May 2012 

 Joint media release with Chris Bowen MP - Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship and Jason Clare MP - Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for  Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel. 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for  Home Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said Tony Abbott and the Coalition continued to  ignore warnings that more lives could be lost at sea, as another asylum seeker boat  was intercepted today. 

 Mr Bowen said the latest boat was the 35th since Tony Abbott rejected the expert  advice, rejected the warnings of more boat and rejected compromise to deliver  offshore processing. 

 'As the government has said countless times, without a genuine deterrent such as  the Malaysia Arrangement, boats will continue arrive. Without legislation, there is no  legal basis for offshore processing, whether it be in Malaysia or Nauru,' Mr Bowen  said. 

 'Tony Abbott's refusal to support the government's offshore processing legislation is  encouraging the people smuggling trade and more people onto dangerous boats.' 

 Mr Clare said it was time for Tony Abbott to stop saying no and vote to allow offshore  processing in Malaysia and Nauru. 

 'Remember what this is all about - 200 people died off the coast of Indonesia last  year. Another 11 died off the coast of Malaysia,' Mr Clare said. 

 'We can stop this but it requires legislation. That means it requires us to work  together. 

 'It is time for Tony Abbott to vote to allow offshore processing in Malaysia and  Nauru.'
