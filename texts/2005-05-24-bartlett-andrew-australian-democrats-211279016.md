 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 05/273 TUESDAY 24 MAY 2005   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS SPOKESPERSON ON IMMIGRATION  DEMOCRATS RENEW CALL FOR RELEASE OF ASYLUM SEEKERSâ€™ CHILDREN ON NAURU The Australian Democrats have welcomed the release of three year old Naomi Leong from Villawood detention centre, and have called for the six children who have been detained on Nauru for even longer periods to also be freed. Democrats' Deputy Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said there are six children on Nauru, aged between 15 and 2, who have been in detention since 2001.   Senator Bartlett has just returned from his third visit to Nauru, and met with almost all of the 52 asylum seekers currently on the island, including all 6 of the children. "It is clear that some of these children have suffered major trauma.  "There is a 14 year old girl, who is the only teenage girl sharing the camp with over 40 men. Her isolation and the suffering she is going through are obvious.  "Over more than three and a half years in detention, the two 7 year old girls and an 8 year old boy have seen all the other children freed while they have been left behind." "The Immigration Minister cannot continue to ignore these children just because they hidden away on Nauru.  The fact is that it is she and her Department who have decided to keep them locked up for so long, and Australian taxpayers who are continuing to foot the multi-million dollar bill." "The long overdue release of this three year old girl shows that the Immigration Minister and the Department already have the power to act to take these children out of such a harmful environment, but are simply refusing to do so." "There is clear evidence of the harm done to children by long-term detention, yet the Minister is refusing to act to prevent it."  Media contact - Daele Healy - 0419 867 649
