 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 STATEMENT BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THE HON SIMON CREAN MP

 Further Excision of Australian Territory

 “….the only substantive differences that emerged in their recollections and the Leader of the Opposition’s is that yesterday no reference was made to assurance or guarantee.

 “The officials believe they were asked to give a guarantee, the Leader of the Opposition seems to be suggesting that he asked for an assurance.  And, I simply make the point again, that it is quite unreasonable to ask, in relation to all of the vagaries that exist in relation to these matters, whether somebody can guarantee that a particular event will occur or not occur.”

 Phillip Ruddock, Question Time, 18/6/02

 Philip Ruddock today confirmed the Government’s absurd proposal to excise over 3,000 islands from Australia’s migration zone will NOT stop boats coming to the Australian mainland, and nor will it stop them leaving Indonesia.

 As he told Parliament, this is what senior Government officials from the People Smuggling Task Force, told me at last Friday’s briefing.

 As I said then, the agencies represented on the People Smuggling Task Force were unable to explain why this further excision would act as an effective deterrent to people smugglers.

 They were also unable to give any assurance that the excision would not simply encourage people smugglers to head for the mainland, nor why the Government announced its decision late on a Friday before a holiday long weekend, without consultation.

 Now that his Immigration Minister has admitted the Government’s surrender to people smugglers will achieve nothing, the Prime Minister should abandon his ludicrous plan.
