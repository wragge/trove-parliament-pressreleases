 Minister's Visit Highlights International Cooperation on People Smuggling MPS 72/2002

 People smuggling and the plight of the world's 19.7million refugees, will be the focal points of discussions during an African and European tour by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock.

 During the two-week tour the Minister will visit several countries including South Africa, Tanzania, Greece, The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia including Kosovo, The Czech Republic, Austria and the UK.

 The Minister will meet with government officials in Europe and Africa, briefing them on Australia's latest changes to legislation related to enhancing border control. In Europe he will also discuss their current efforts to stop people smuggling.

 The Minister, who left for South Africa today, will discuss refugees, migration and the global problem of people smuggling, with the South African Minister for Home Affairs, Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi.

 "International cooperation is essential for a consistent and successful response to the illegal trafficking of human cargo," Mr Ruddock said.

 "The only way to stop these inhumane operations is to tackle the problem from all sides.

 "We must have strong support and understanding between all countries affected by this insidious practice."

 The Minister will also visit a refugee camp, a hospital and a special centre for women in Tanzania, to inspect first-hand how critical the refugee situation is in this African nation.

 "While I'm in Tanzania I will investigate the circumstances of some refugees who may need resettlement in Australia," Mr Ruddock said.

 "I will be highlighting the plight of the world's legitimate refugees: people who are living in appalling poverty and destitution as opposed to those who have been living without persecution and with the financial resources to pay people smugglers thousands of dollars to come Australia."

 The last leg of the Minister's tour will see him visit the United Kingdom.

 "I'll be ending the trip in the UK where I'll be meeting with government ministers, officials, academics and lawyers to exchange ideas on border protection," Mr Ruddock said.

 On his return to Australia, Mr Ruddock will report to the Australian public, the outcome of his visit and the reaction of other governments to Australia's initiatives on border protection.
