 Ombudsman's Report is Unbalanced MPS 122/2001

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock said today he was disappointed by the Commonwealth Ombudsman's unbalanced report into migration applications by the family of the late Shahraz Kiane.

 "That someone should take their own life in the way that Mr Kiane did is indeed tragic and I again extend my sympathies to his wife and children," Mr Ruddock said.

 "But such actions, or threats of such actions, cannot be used to put pressure on decision-makers in the hope of coercing them into not applying the law and government policy.

 "The Ombudsman has suggested that officers of my Department should have over-ridden the long-standing policy of successive governments, by automatically waiving the health requirement in this case and ignoring the impact on the community.

 "This is despite the requirement to consider potential costs of $750,000 and whether access to health and community services for Australian citizens could be prejudiced.

 "In considering whether to waive the health requirement, I take a compassionate view, but I am required to carefully consider all of the facts, not just the facts that suit one pre-determined view of a case."

 Two key issues in this case were:

 whether Mr Kiane could have returned safely to live in Pakistan with his spouse and three children; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 what weight could be given to the claims of Mr Kiane and his extended family that they would bear the health and social welfare costs involved. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 While Mr Kiane was found to be a refugee in 1996 on the basis of a fear of persecution in Pakistan due his alleged association with a religious minority, it was subsequently found that:

 Mr Kiane did return to Pakistan for several months without incident, despite a claimed fear of persecution; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the specific religious minority community in Pakistan had advised that Mr Kiane was unknown to their leaders in his home town; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 a document purporting to show links with that community was found to be fake; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Mr Kiane has very close relatives in the Pakistan Army and that his family lives in a military cantonment; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Mr Kiane's family was being assisted by a friend in the Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Mr Ruddock said that Mr Kiane had clearly misled his Department to obtain a protection visa in Australia.

 In addition, given the circumstances of Mr Kiane's wife and children in Pakistan, the family was unable to support claims in their original application for a resettlement visa to meet the threshold criteria of substantial discrimination or persecution.

 "Mr Kiane and his extended family had also given commitments in relation to immigration matters on a number of occasions, but these commitments were not honoured," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Given all these factors, it was difficult to give weight to their offer to bear the health and social welfare costs associated with Mr Kiane's daughter.

 "This case highlights the importance of considering all of the facts and coming to a balanced view after all issues have been properly investigated," Mr Ruddock said.

 In response to the three specific recommendations, Mr Ruddock said the Government was already reviewing the Humanitarian Resettlement Program; there is already a specific visa for reuniting family members under the Humanitarian Program; and policy on the health requirement has already been reviewed by successive governments.

 "I am disappointed that the Ombudsman apparently believes we should look at this case in isolation and not apply the same standards as are applied to all other cases involving the health waiver," Mr Ruddock said.

 "This comes down to a fundamental issue of fairness and a Government's responsibility to take decisions with the whole community and national interest in mind," Mr Ruddock said.
