 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Greens’ immigration spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson-Young   

 Wednesday 22 May 2013   

 ASIO laws must change to stop further harm to refugees   

 The Australian Greens today welcomed the release of a mother and child from the legal black hole of  indefinite detention upon ASIO's retraction of her adverse security assessment.   

 "The news that ASIO has reversed its decision on Manokalo's case shows how critically important a  proper review process is and that the indefinite detention of refugees is absolutely not justified" said the  Greens’ immigration spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson-Young this afternoon.    

 "The law must now be changed to ensure that ASIO is compelled to do periodic internal reviews for all  refugees who are stuck in the inhumane limbo of indefinite detention.    

 "A mother and her child have been locked up without cause and suffered unnecessarily at the hands of  the Government for over 18 months and there are numerous others still in this dire situation.   

 "There is every likelihood that this was a systematic failure as part of a shadowy process and it is  imperative that light be thrown on all cases through a fair and thorough internal ASIO review.    

 "Refugees in this situation should be immediately released on community detention with appropriate  conditions while ASIO and the Government expand their review to find out who else has been wrongly  imprisoned.
