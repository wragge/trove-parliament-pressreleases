 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration   

 MINISTER RUDDOCK’S   CHEAP STUNT WILL BACKFIRE   

 Labor’s Statement on the Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2003   

 Minister Ruddock today has engaged in a desperate attempt to shift public  attention from the Cash for Visas scandal back to so-called border protection  issues. 

 

 For the last three weeks in Parliament, Minister Ruddock has been under  pressure and has failed to answer a series of questions about the way in which  donations to the Liberal Party have influenced the allocation of visas.  Indeed, in  one answer it is clear that Minister Ruddock has misled the Parliament.   

 Desperate to divert attention elsewhere, Minister Ruddock has rushed in to  Parliament today with what he now says is an urgent Bill responding to Federal  Court decisions about persons whose detention has become unlawful.     

 This is a cheap and stupid stunt.  To distract attention from the Cash for Visas  scandal, Minister Ruddock is now manufacturing a crisis and pretending this  legislation is urgently needed.  Minister Ruddock has known about the Federal  Court decisions for many months.  If he wanted to respond to them, he could  have done it far earlier.     

 Labor will study the Bill and respond to it in detail, but Labor makes Minister  Ruddock this promise - if he forces the House of Representatives and the Senate  to urgently debate this Bill next week, Labor will ensure it is a lengthy and  strident debate on the real crisis in Australian immigration system - his Cash for  Visa scandal.   

 Minister Ruddock, Australians now know who the real queue-jumpers are - Liberal Party donors.  This cheap stunt won’t cover up that fact.
