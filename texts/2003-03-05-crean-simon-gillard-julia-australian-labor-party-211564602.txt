 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION   

 

 JOINT STATEMENT BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON SIMON CREAN MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION  JULIA GILLARD MP   

 EAST TIMORESE ASYLUM-SEEKERS   

 In the Senate tomorrow, Labor will move an amendment to the Migration  Legislation Amendment (No.1  Bill which, if adopted, will compel the  Government to grant permanent residency to the around 1,600 East Timorese  asylum-seekers who are currently being threatened with deportation.  

 )

 

 Labor believes that these East Timorese asylum-seekers are a very special case  deserving of the utmost compassion.  Most of these asylum-seekers have lived  in Australia for over a decade and fled East Timor at a time when executions,  torture and arbitrary arrest were common.     

 Both the then Labor Government and the current Coalition Government failed to  respond with real compassion to their plight.  Instead, both Governments  embarked on a strategy of deliberately freezing the processing of their claims.    The East Timorese are the only class of asylum-seekers who are in a position  where the failure to process their claims was the Government’s fault, not their  fault.   

 Today, East Timor has fundamentally changed, and it is true to say that if these  asylum-seekers returned to East Timor they may not be subject to persecution.   In that sense, as recent decisions of the Refugee Review Tribunal reflect, these  asylum-seekers are no longer refugees under the Refugee Convention.   

 However, these asylum-seekers do deserve our compassion.  They fled real  persecution, the delay in the resolution of their claims was due to the actions of  the Australian Government, they have lived for a very extended period of time  in Australia, and many have no real ongoing connection with their former  homeland.

 Labor has been urging Minister Ruddock to resolve this long-running sore by  creating a special visa class for these individuals.  The Minister has not  responded, and Labor will now seek to force the Minister to act through this 

 amendment.   

 There is no reason to fear the setting of a precedent that could be used by  others, because the circumstances of these asylum-seekers are truly unique.   The amendment has been carefully drafted to ensure that only the East  Timorese asylum-seekers who had their cases frozen by the Australian  Government will be eligible for the special humanitarian visa. 

 

 Through their support for the deployment of Australian forces in East Timor,  Australians showed their real concern for the East Timorese.  Many Australians  understand the debt of gratitude we owe them from World War II.  Many other  Australians believe that, as a nation, we waited too long to help them in their  time of need.   

 We urge the Senate to vote for the amendment and we particularly urge  Government members to do the right thing and vote for it.  If adopted by the  Senate, the amendment will then be debated in the House of Representatives.    

 In addition to moving this amendment to the Migration Legislation Amendment  (No.1) Bill, Labor will again move its amendment to compel the Howard  Government to get children out from behind the razor wire of high security  detention.  This amendment was defeated on party lines in the House of  Representatives.  A number of Liberal moderates contemplated voting for the  amendment, but did not do so because Minister Ruddock announced that he  would be changing the circumstances of children in detention.   

 

 The Minister’s statement has proved to be nothing more than a device to stop  a number of Liberal MPs voting for Labor’s amendment.  Today, around  120 children remain in detention in Australia, and nothing has been done to  implement the Minister’s statement.   

 Liberal MPs should not allow themselves to continue to be fooled by the  Minister for Immigration.  If they believe children should not be behind razor  wire, they should vote for Labor’s amendment.
