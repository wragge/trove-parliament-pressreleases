 Four Corners addresses myth of Australia’s humanitarian refugee program  

 The myth that Australia has high standards of compassion in our treatment of refugees has been exploded by the Four Corners program aired last night (ABC TV Monday 13 March 2000, repeated 1pm 14 March 2000). 

 “The Government has been willing to encourage hostility towards people who arrive here by boat and refused to acknowledge that some are genuine refugees who are treated abominably,” said Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Democrats’ immigration spokesperson. 

 “Australia is one of very few countries that incarcerates all asylum seekers. It is cruel and unnecessary.” 

 Senator Andrew Bartlett said he was relieved that the truth about Australia’s treatment of refugees was being documented. The Four Corners program, A Well Founded Fear of Persecution, alleged Algerian asylum seekers who had been on a hunger strike were bound and forcibly sedated before being deported illegally to South Africa. 

 “For too long now we have had senior members of government, such as West Australian Premier Richard Court, demonising refugees,” he said. 

 “We have seen genuine refugees slammed by the Immigration Minister for taking up space, savage cutbacks to Australia’s refugee program and constant attempts to limit the legal avenues for refugee determinations. 

 “My office receives many calls and letters from asylum seekers as well as people who work with them, including lawyers, doctors and religious organisations. The stories that people tell are increasingly desperate and tragic,” said Senator Bartlett. 

 “A system which puts the most vulnerable of people through this can only end in tragedy. 

 “Too many people are treated like criminals by the Department of Immigration. It can take around 60 days for an application to be processed during which time these people who have lost so much and suffered so much are locked up and denied access to telephones, lawyers,

 priests and family. Their fear and uncertainty is continued. They include children and pregnant women,” said Senator Bartlett. 

 “I know many Australians would be appalled at the true circumstances surrounding our processing of asylum seeker applications. 

 “Despite our treatment of refugees being the focus of a Senate inquiry, the conditions faced by refugees has continued to deteriorate even whilst the inquiry has yet to report,” Senator Bartlett who initiated a Senate inquiry into Australia’s refugee program, said.
