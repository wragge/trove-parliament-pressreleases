 MEDIA RELEASE   Senator the Hon Amanda Vanstone Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation   128.04  Peter Qasim - The Facts   The Minister for Immigration Multicultural and Indigenous Affirs, Senator the Hon Amanda Vanstone, today released a brief statement from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous affairs setting out facts of the case of Mr Peter Qasim who is currently in Immigration detention.  “In view of the widespread reporting of alleged facts in relation to Mr Qasim’s circumstances there is a need to ensure that the department’s understanding of the facts in relation to Mr Qasim are available to the public,” Minister Vanstone said.  The attached statement was prepared by the department in consultation with legal advisers to correct many misconceptions in the public arena while maintaining privacy responsibilities.  “Mr Qasim cannot be considered stateless until all reasonable attempts to establish his identity and nationality have been undertaken,”  “As the statement provided by my department makes clear, the department needs Mr Qasim to fully cooperate to resolve his nationality.”                        13 September 2004

 Peter Qasim - six years in immigration detention   

 â¢ Mr Qasim arrived in Australia by boat in September 1998.  â¢ He was refused a protection visa in October 1998    - This decision was affirmed by the Refugee Review Tribunal in January 1999.    - At this point Mr Qasim was available for removal, however he refused to 

 cooperate with the Department’s efforts to remove him and while he did  provide information, it could not be verified and was inconsistent with some  other claims made at later times.  Nevertheless, the Department approached  the Indian High Commission to seek a travel document which was not made  available as the Indian authorities were not satisfied with his identity.    â¢ Mr Qasim requested to be removed from Australia in November 2002, but failed to 

 complete and sign an Indian travel document application until September 2003.  â¢ Mr Qasim applied to the Federal Court for release from detention in November 2003,  however after reviewing the detail of his case the Court dismissed his appeal.   

 â¢ Mr Qasim refused to cooperate with the Department’s removal attempts for five years.  â¢ He claims to have been cooperating fully for the past year, but he has continued to  provide the Department with information that is inconsistent or cannot be verified by  Indian authorities. 

 â¢ Claims by his supporters that he has been trying to tell the same story while in  detention are not valid.  He has been inconsistent and sometimes contradictory in the  detail of his claims to the Department in areas such as:  - his place of birth 

 - his profession 

 - education details  - residential addresses.   

 â¢ A wide range of information Mr Qasim has provided to the Department has then been  provided to the Indian authorities and they continue to be unable to confirm his identity.  â¢ He is not considered stateless, he simply has not been identified based on the  information he has provided and therefore the Indian authorities have not been willing 

 to issue a travel document to him.  â¢ It is clear that provision of accurate information that can be verified would assist in  confirming his identity, therefore facilitating his removal.  â¢ That does not mean we are not continuing to try to establish his identity  â¢ The Minister announced on 31 August that she had asked that these cases be kept 

 under close review by the Department, and that is what is happening.
