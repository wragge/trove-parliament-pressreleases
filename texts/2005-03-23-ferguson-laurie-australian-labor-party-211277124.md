 LAURIE FERGUSON MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR REID   

 MEDIA STATEMENT 

 

 YES MINISTER! - VANSTONE’S QUICK FIX SOLUTION FOR LONG TERM DETAINEES   

 The changes to the processing of a small number of long term detainees must be met with some  caution,” stated Labor’s Shadow Minister for Immigration, Laurie Ferguson.   

 The Opposition welcomes the release of these long term detainees on a humanitarian basis.  Nevertheless, we have to question why now - why not 2 yrs ago or 2 months later. It’s a bit  suspicious that the government suddenly decides to be more humane on this area after years of  pressure for procedural and legislative changes.    

 It seems the government is trying to detract attention from the recent hype surrounding Cornelia  Rau, seizing school kids, the proposed 20,000 skilled migration rise and talk of an army of unskilled  entrants. Even Costello described the skilled workers proposal as ‘Un-Australian.’   

 Labor believes that people who are essentially stateless need to be deemed so with humanity and  expedition. As soon as the Department concludes that people cannot be sent back - they should be  released. Labor also believes that people who are in detention for more than two years and cannot be  deported should be released, so that their hope in remaining is not futile.   

 Labor is also very concerned and seeks clarification from the Minister that when the detainees sign  an agreement to return home that this should not block out possible appeals for a Section 48  discretion, where situation in their homeland worsens. Whilst reasonable monitoring of those  released is desirable, it should not be so draconian as  to deny them real employment opportunities or  adequate settlement provisions in Australia.    

 Labor will also consider a policy allowing those released for a significant time under this new visa to  be granted permanent residence.
