 MEDIA RELEASE 

 ABBOTT ATTACKS MCMAHON COMMUNITY WITH CRUEL CUTS   

 Shadow Minister for Citizenship and Multiculturalism, Michelle Rowland and Member  for McMahon, Chris Bowen have today met with communities in Western Sydney  who have been impacted by the Abbott Government’s cuts to multicultural funding.    

 Organisations impacted include the Assyrian Resource Centre (ARC) in Fairfield  which has had their fully budgeted grant of $150,000 cut.     

 Ms Rowland said the Abbott Government’s decision to rip $11.5 million from the  Building Multicultural Communities Program was a disgrace and would have an  adverse impact on the community.   

 “Tony Abbott and Kevin Andrews have cruelly cut grants to organisations that work  to maintain cohesive and socially inclusive neighborhoods in the very diverse  western Sydney region and regions right around the country,” Ms Rowland said.   

 “The best way that governments can help build inclusive, harmonious communities is  from the bottom up, by supporting grassroots programs like this.”   

 Mr Bowen said he was disappointed that the Assyrian Resource Centre has had its  approved funding snatched away by the Abbott Government.   

 “The ARC provides an essential service to the local Assyrian community, many of  whom are from a refugee background,” Mr Bowen said.  

 “These cuts will directly affect newly arrived families that depend on such services to  help them integrate into Australian society.” 

 Ms Rowland also encouraged the community to send Tony Abbott a message about  his cuts to multicultural organisations by visiting www.ISupportCommunities.com
