 Fasts in Support of Asylum Seekers End With Vigil Outside Cathederal 

 A series of rolling 3-day fasts in support detained asylum seekers will conclude today with a vigil  outside St Stephens Catholic Cathedral in Brisbane.

 Asylum seekers in Baxter detention centre ended their hunger strike after listening to the pleas  of their supporters from all around Australia, and in the knowledge that they will continue to be  supported in their ongoing efforts for justice. 

 Queensland Senator Andrew Bartlett, who participated in a prolonged fast, said the struggle to  ensure freedom for the asylum seekers would continue.

 "Whilst there may seem to be no hope for the detainees, we should remember that this time last  year, there were 285 people still detained on Nauru. At the end of 2004, only 54 remain. Whilst  that is 54 too many, the fact remains that over 230 people were freed during the course of the  year, despite the Government insisting until the last moment that none of them were refugees  and they should all return home." 

 "There is little doubt that it is not safe for the vast majority of asylum seekers in detention to  return home. They should be freed to rebuild their lives and may thousands of Australians will  continue to campaign for that to happen." 

 WHAT: The final 3 day fast in this action, which began with Senator Bartlett on Friday 17th  December, will conclude with a vigil outside St Stephens Cathedral in Brisbane. 

 WHEN: Friday 31st December, from 12.30p.m

 WHERE: St Stephens Cathedral, Charlotte St., Brisbane
