 UNHCR MEETINGS IN GENEVA 

 The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Peter Dutton is travelling to Geneva  this week to attend high level meetings convened by the United Nations and led by the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) regarding Syrian refugees.   

 The Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon will open the meeting in  Geneva on Wednesday.   

 Mr Dutton will meet the newly appointed United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees Filippo Grandi ahead of Wednesday’s conference.   

 Mr Dutton’s participation will demonstrate Australia’s ongoing support for the UNHCR at  one of a number of high-level meetings during 2016 which aim to further promote a  more effective international response to mass migration and displacement issues.   

 The Minister will re-affirm the Australian Government’s already significant commitment  to the Syrian refugee crisis through Australia’s Refugee and Humanitarian Programme  and financial support to UNHCR.
