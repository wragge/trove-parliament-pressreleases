 MEDIA RELEASE

 Statement: Liberal spill motion 

 

 I welcome the decision by the Liberal party room to vote against the spill motion.   

 As a Nationals Member of Parliament, I do not attend Liberal Party meetings and do not  receive a vote on motions relating to the leadership of the Federal Parliamentary Liberal  Party.   

 The Nationals remain committed to working with our Liberal colleagues to get Australia  back on track.   

 The Abbott-Truss Government has delivered on many of its core election promises,  particularly in relation to the carbon tax, mining tax, illegal boat arrivals and infrastructure  investments.   

 After inheriting a budget deficit which was out of control, the Coalition knows tough  decisions will need to be made.   

 However, it is essential Australians understand and embrace the proposed reforms. These  reforms are necessary if we are to deliver the services which Australians rightly deserve.   

 Our focus is to support families, create jobs and deliver a safe and secure Australia.   

 ENDS
