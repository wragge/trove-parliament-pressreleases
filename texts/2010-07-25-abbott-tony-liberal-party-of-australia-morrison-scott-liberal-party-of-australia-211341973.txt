 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH 

 â¢ Tony Abbott, Joint Press Conference, 

 Parliament House, Canberra   25/07/10  

 Subjects: The Coalition’s real action on sustainable population growth; Leader’s  Debate preparation; Penny Wong’s comments on carbon tax.  

 E&OE    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, it’s good of you guys to interrupt your debate preparation to come along this  morning. Look, last week, for most of the week, the Prime Minister was engaging in a  debate about population. It’s impossible to discuss population without also discussing 

 immigration because immigration accounts for about two thirds of our population  increase. In fact, it’s fundamentally dishonest of the Prime Minister to pretend that  population has nothing to do with immigration. So, today I’m here to launch the  Coalition’s 2010 Immigration Policy. I’m pleased to be joined by my friend and  Shadow Minister for Immigration Scott Morrison and also by my friend and Shadow  Parliamentary Secretary for Population, Cory Bernardi.    

 Immigration was running at about 200,000 a year in the last term of the Howard  Government. Under the Rudd/Gillard Government, immigration has gone up to  300,000. We had 200,000, more or less, under the Howard Government at the time of  an unprecedented economic boom, under the Rudd/Gillard Government, we’ve had  300,000, not withstanding the global financial crisis and the associated economic  slowdown. 300,000 is just not sustainable. Immigration at this rate is just not  sustainable. So the Coalition will reduce net overseas migration to 170,000 a year  within our first term. We will maintain though, the various employer nominated  categories, because it’s important that business has the skills and the people that it  needs.    

 Most of you may not be aware, but I am a migrant myself. Australia is an immigrant  society, proudly so. The Coalition parties are pro-immigrant, but it’s very important  that our immigration program have the support of our people and that is what this  policy is designed to ensure.    

 So I’ll now ask Scott to say a few words and then we’ll hear a little from Cory.    

 SCOTT MORRISON:    

 Thank you, Tony. The policy we’ve released today is all about one thing and that is  about a sustainable rate of population growth and how to achieve it and what can be  done immediately to move towards that goal. Sustainability is all about ensuring you 

 don’t deny the opportunities and quality of life that we enjoy today to those  generations that follow. That’s what sustainability means and it’s important that we  don’t run at levels of population growth, which at over two per cent per year at the  moment, are historically high and in recent times, but also historically very high in  terms of global population growth, global population growth today is around 1.2 per  cent. In the OECD countries, it’s less than one per cent. What we are proposing in this  policy is to restore within a first term the population growth rate to 1.4 per cent, which  is Australia’s long run average. At that long run average, Australia’s been able to  enjoy considerable and great economic success, particularly throughout the 11 and a  half years of the Howard-Costello Government, the Coalition Government. So  returning those growth levels to that level, within the first term of a Coalition  Government would ensure we are meeting the needs of our economy, that most  importantly we are meeting the needs of preserving the quality of life, both for current  generations and future generations. To just run you through some of the key elements 

 of the programme, in particular where we restate today our commitment made back in  April of this year, to establish a Productivity and Sustainability Commission from the  current Productivity Commission, whose job would be to set growth bands to advise  the Government on what rate of growth we would need to be at in the future from  year to year to ensure that we’re growing at a sustainable level.  

 

 The Productivity and Sustainability Commission would be basically keeping score on  the performance and delivering for infrastructure, services, environmental  management, all of these things, to give us the confidence, and most importantly to  give Australians the confidence that the rate of growth at which we are setting our  migration program and our overall rate of population growth is sustainable. Tony has  outlined the position on where we need to get to on net overseas migration and a rate  of growth within our term and that’s taking real action on immigration. The Prime  Minister cannot have it both ways. She cannot say that she doesn’t believe in a big  Australia, and then go onto say that she’s not going to talk about immigration. The  only thing that can be done practically, in a most significant way, in the next three  years is to remove the population pressure that is forcing the decline in qualities of  life of services and infrastructure and the things people are experiencing at the  moment. Tony has outlined also that we will be making clear commitments to the  areas of the employer nominated program for skilled migration and in the document  you’ll also see that we’ve made commitments to give priority to particularly high  growth states like Western Australia and Queensland and ensuring that our employer  nominated programs and skilled programs, we’re addressing the needs of small  businesses and particularly businesses in regional areas. We will establish on coming  to Government a process, a white paper process, which will be tasked to identify the  rorts, the abuses, the tightening of the program that can be achieved and will be  achieved for the Coalition to meet this target. There will be a discussion paper by the  end of the year and the white paper process would be completed in time to set the  annual migration program in our first Budget.  

 

 They’re the commitments that are outlined, it’s a clear policy, it’s not one line in a  speech, which we always see from the Prime Minister, it’s a considered policy, it’s a  responsible policy that address the population pressures that are being faced mainly  by people in our cities around the country.    

 CORY BERNARDI:    

 Thank you, Scott. Thank you, Tony. During my responsibilities as the Shadow  Parliamentary Secretary for   Population Policy, I’ve consulted widely with Australians in every state and territory  and let me just say their concerns are not about, directly about, immigration, they are  a very welcoming nation and the people of Australia understand that immigration has  played a key role in our foundation and development of our country. But they are  concerned about the productivity of our nation, the liveability and the sustainability of  our migration program. The Coalition’s come up with a policy that will reflect the  concerns, the very real concerns of the men and women of Australia and will ensure  that our nation will continue to grow and get stronger in the years ahead.    

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, can I ask you [inaudible], the policy you announced in April, you said that  you would delegate the to the Productivity Commission, to set benchmarks, to set  targets and Mr Morrison said during the week that you would be confined by what  they recommend. Haven’t you just confined them to a target?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 The Productivity and Sustainability Commission will give us advice about future  population levels, which are compatible with economic and environmental  sustainability, but it will always be the Government’s responsibility to set the number.    

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, the BIR Shrapnel has already predicted a slowdown in net overseas  migration to 145,000 persons by 2011/2012. So are you saying that an Abbott  Government, in your first term, would actually have a larger net overseas migration  than a Gillard Government?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 No, I’m saying absolutely not. The interesting thing about the Prime Minister last  week was that she was very, very keen to talk about population, but not honest about  the role of immigration in population. Now, you cannot have a population discussion  without also having an immigration discussion. And you can’t say you are against a  big Australia without also discussing the immigration rates. So, what we’re  announcing today is a demonstration that we are fair dinkum, that we will back up our  talk with appropriate policy. That’s what we’re doing.    

 QUESTION:  

 

 What’s the difference between your policy and Labor’s policy? I mean, BIS Shrapnel  is forecasting 145,000 by 2011/2012. So are you for higher immigration? Is this  [inaudible]?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, if Labor wants lower immigration, let it specify a number. They can’t say  they’re in favour of lower immigration without specifying a number, and that was the  fundamental dishonesty of the Prime Minister last week. She said she wanted to  dramatically reduce population growth, without having the guts to talk about  immigration numbers. Now, if she doesn’t like our number, she should say so. If she  thinks our number is too low or too high she should say what her number is.  

 

 QUESTION:    

 What would the population be, Mr Abbott, under your policy by 2050? What  population do you want to see by 2050?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Alex, it would be a lot lower than the 36 million nominated by Kevin Rudd as his ‘big  Australia,’ and supported at the time by Julia Gillard as Deputy Prime Minister.    

 QUESTION:    

 [Inaudible]    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, as Scott said, we would be guided, not ruled, but guided by a White Paper  which we would commission shortly after coming to government, and which would  inform decisions that would be announced at budget time next year. What we won’t  cut, though, are the various employer nominated categories, because we do need  skills, business does need to continue to grow, and it’s very important that we don’t  put any obstacles in the way of growing business.    

 QUESTION:   [Inaudible] the Family Reunion Programme, and if so, why shouldn’t Australians be  allowed to bring relatives to Australia?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, again, those sorts of specific details can only be decided in government, and  they would be informed by a White Paper process. What we would do is manage the  programme to bring it down to what we think are sustainable long-term numbers. But  what we won’t do is get in the way of legitimate Australian business that is seeking  appropriately to expand.    

 QUESTION:  

 

 How do you know you can hit your target if you can’t say which parts of the  programme you’ll cut from?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, because there are all sorts of different components, and there are some very  large components of the immigration programme that if reduced would certainly bring  us very swiftly to the 170,000 maximum that we’re nominating. So it’s just a  question, it’s just a question of intelligently managing the programme, making sure  that all of the entrants in these various categories are fair dinkum. That’s what we did  before, particularly under Phillip Ruddock, that’s what we will do again.    

 QUESTION:    

 [Inaudible]    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 No, it’s not.    

 QUESTION:    

 Yes it is.    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 No, it’s not. No it’s not. Sorry Tim, it’s not.    

 QUESTION:    

 [Inaudible] migration programme, it’s the bit that is under the control of government  of skilled migration is almost two-thirds, and the rest is family reunion and refugees.    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Tim, look, I’ll get Scott to take you through very carefully the numbers in the  programme, but by far the largest contributor to net overseas migration are student  entrants, educational entrants. That is by far the largest contributor. Now, now -    

 QUESTION:    

 So you’re planning to cut students? You’re planning to cut students, foreign students?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, what we are planning -    

 QUESTION:    

 That’s the biggest target, right? That’s where you’ll get your bang for the buck,  cutting foreign students coming into Australia?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 What we are planning to do is to get our immigration levels to those which we believe  are economically, environmentally, and politically, if you like, sustainable. We need  an immigration programme which can be supported for the long term by the  Australian people. If we want to be a cohesive, prosperous society we need strong,  popular support for the immigration programme, and that’s what this policy is  designed to achieve.    

 QUESTION:    

 Are you targeting foreign students, and if you are, why would you do that when it is a  billion dollar industry for Australia, one of our biggest industries?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, I am all in favour of Australia selling education, but what I don’t want us to be  doing is selling immigration outcomes in the guise of selling education.    

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, the student numbers have been coming down, and the requirements have  been tightening. So wouldn’t it be more relevant to take the last financial year rather  than 2008-09, and what do you understand the final figure, well, the figures, the  projected figures for the last financial year will be?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, look, Michelle, I don’t have access to official advice. All I can go on is the  published figures, and the published figures show that calendar ‘09 it was something  like 277,000. So what we are proposing is a reduction of 100,000 on ’09. That’s what  we’re proposing. Now, as I said, we’re going to get there sensibly, carefully, with 

 good advice. All we are saying today is that what we’re not going to do is to restrict  the various employer nominated categories, because we think that they are important  for Australia’s continued economic health. But look, I might ask Scott to say a few 

 words, because he’s more familiar with all of these tables than I am.    

 SCOTT MORRISON:    

 Well, the figure that Tony referred to of 277.7 is the calendar 2009. There have been  no figures released by the ABS for 2009-10. We don’t have access to that  information. No, there’s no estimate, there’s no figures that we’re aware of, that’s 

 been brought to our attention. And the migration program is set on a financial year  basis. And the most recent financial year figures that we have available to us is the  2008-09 figures and if you go to the Department of Immigration’s Population Flows  document, you’ll find a fairly extensive outline of the program, but ultimately we  would have to deal with the 09-10 figures when they’re available and they’re not 

 available today.    

 Other comments have been made about the BIS Shrapnel forecast. Well, that’s BIS  Shrapnel’s opinion, it’s not government’s policy. And if I follow the logic of the  questions, if the Government has a secret plan to cut immigration, well, they should  say what it is. We’ve been very clear and open and honest here about what our  intention is to do in the first term of an Abbott Coalition government, to get…    

 QUESTION:    

 [inaudible] 170,000. What’s the thinking behind 170,000? What’s that based on?    

 SCOTT MORRISON:    

 It’s based…well, as I said in the opening remarks, our target here is to get the  population growth rate to 1.4 per cent. And our estimate is that that requires getting  net overseas migration to at least 170,000 by the end of the term. What we’re trying to  do here is control and get back to a sustainable level the population growth rate. The  population growth rate is what puts pressure on our cities around the country.    

 Remember, more that nine out of 10 people who come into Australia end up in the  cities. The Government can talk til the cows come home about getting people out into  the regions and we would pursue policies similar to that but we cannot be unrealistic  and disingenuous with the Australian people by suggesting that is a substitute for  easing the population pressures on those in western Sydney and other parts of the  country. It is just simply not telling the truth.    

 QUESTION:    

 …1.4 per cent is your growth target for the next term.    

 SCOTT MORRISON:    

 That’s right.    

 QUESTION:    

 The Productivity and Sustainability Commission you’ve established, you’ve said that  it would set a population growth band of upper and lower levels…    

 SCOTT MORRISON:    

 That’s right.    

 QUESTION:    

 And would adjust pop…is the 1.4 going to be the upper limit that’s going to have to  [inaudible] or the lower limit or the medium limit?    

 SCOTT MORRISON:  

 

 Well, the Productivity Commission, I’m sure, will advise us in due course, Phil. 1.4  per cent, I think, is a very reasonable estimate of what could…well it could be right  smack back in the middle of it, or it could even be at the upper end of it, Phil. But  we’ll have to wait and see what they say but, what I think the Australian people  want…no, let me finish, what the Australian people want to know for us going into  this election is where we would take population growth. And we will take that growth  level to 1.4 per cent. But we’ll also be getting the Productivity Commission…1.4 is  what we’ve given a commitment that it’ll be no greater than, under a Coalition  government by the end of our first term. Now, the Productivity and Sustainability  Commission will give us advice and they will give us a band, as you know, not a  single figure, a band.    

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, why did the Liberal Party endorse David Barker as its candidate?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, he’s unendorsed. He’s disendorsed. He’s gone, he’s finished. And we now have  a new candidate, our new candidate in the seat of Chifley is Venus Priest. She’s a 41-year-old small business person who lives in the area.    

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, [inaudible]?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, the point is, the point is that attacks on people based on their religion should  have no place whatsoever in this election campaign.    

 QUESTION:    

 What do you think of Don Randall’s comments yesterday? About Julia  Gillard…[inaudible]    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, I just, I’m not aware of Don’s particular comments, but I just want to make it  very clear that attacks on people based on their religion have no place in this election  campaign and will not be made by me.    

 QUESTION:    

 How’s your debate prep going?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Debate prep? Look, of course. Who wouldn’t be? Who wouldn’t be? I mean, this is 

 obviously a pretty big day in the campaign. It’s obviously an opportunity for me to  put the Prime Minister on the spot for the essential fraudulence of Labor’s campaign  so far. The fact that there’s a fundamental dishonesty about all of the things that she’s  claimed to fix. The fact that she hasn’t fixed the mining tax, she hasn’t fixed boat  people, she hasn’t fixed population, she hasn’t fixed climate change. I mean, all of the 

 announcements that she made in the run-up to the election campaign, and since the  election campaign started, are essentially fraudulent.    

 And while I’m on that subject, and thanks for the opportunity Alex, look, let’s be very  clear about this. The Prime Minister’s sub-contracting out of climate change policy to  a glorified focus group is a fundamental abdication of leadership, or it is camouflage 

 for the coming carbon tax. And I notice that Senator Wong today said that the  Government will not give up on a carbon price, regardless of what this focus group  says. In fact, it’s pretty clear from what Senator Wong has said today that basically  they’ll keep going back to the focus group until the focus group gives them the  answer that they want. And the answer that they want is, there must be a carbon price.  In other words, there must be a carbon tax and so I just say again, as I will say every  day between now and polling day, if you don’t want a carbon tax, you’ve got the 

 change the government, because as sure as night follows day, if this Government is  re-elected, there will be a carbon tax. And what that will mean is fewer jobs, higher  prices, pressure on families’ standard of living.    

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, if population is such a concern, and population growth, why was your  government telling us, and giving us Baby Bonuses, telling us growth was good for  the country, have one for mum, dad and the country? Isn’t this more about people  [inaudible]?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 No, look. It’s…there are obviously a whole range of factors that play into population.  Natural increase is significant. And I would like to see our birth rate improve because  even now, despite the uptick in the birth rate over the last few years, it’s still  significantly below replacement level. But two thirds of the population increase is  coming from immigration and it’s got to be sustainable. It’s got to be something the  Australian public can support. I want to see a sustainable, supportable immigration  program, going into the future because, as I said, I am an immigrant myself. We are  an immigrant society. We always will be. That’s a good thing. But let’s have an  immigration program that people can support, that they don’t think is out of control.  That they don’t think has been sub-contracted to people smugglers. That’s what we  want to do, to give the Australian public an immigration program that they know is  under our control and is firmly in Australia’s national interests. Thank you very much,  thank you.
