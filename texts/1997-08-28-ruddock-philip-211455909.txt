  INTEGRATED HUMANITARIAN SETTLEMENT STRATEGY 

  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock has announced the  first measures in an Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy to address the specific  needs of refugees and other humanitarian entrants who have fled human rights abuse. 

  'This is part of the Coalition's Budget commitment of an additional $20.8 million over  four years for a new strategy to provide a national framework resulting in better  planning, coordination and delivery of humanitarian settlement services," Mr Ruddock  said. 

  "The first installment of the four year funding plan has been allocated for specific  service provision and case management for refugees and other humanitarian entrants,  while the ailocation of material assistance has also been revised and upgraded." 

  "Many refugees have fled persecution, leaving all their possessions behind or having  had them confiscated by their oppressors. The provision of material assistance, gives  them a basic start." 

  "Government contributions channelled through voluntary groups registered under the  Community Refugee Settlement Scheme have been increased by $0.48m to $2m and  will be set on a household, rather than an individual basis." 

  For a single refugee, the grant for clothing and household items will rise from $665 to  $1,100, while for a couple with no children, it will increase from $1 ,130 to $1,400, with  another $300 for each additional person in the household. 

  "Funding on a household basis recognises that the cost of establishing a household is  only marginally more for couples than for a single person," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "I will also ask the Refugee Resettlement Advisory Council to recommend possible  improvements to the delivery of material assistance." 

  In the second initiative as part of the additional funding for humanitarian settlement  services, $4.234 million has been allocated as an interim measure , for grant  applications submitted by community organisations, to further the aims of the strategy. 

  "The Strategy will introduce specialised case management which will enable service  providers in the areas of health, English language training , employment, specialist  youth and other services, to target those most in need of assistance." 

  Organisations will work under service and funding agreements to ensure appropriate  accountability . All grants are effective for one year from 1 October 1997 , although a  number of these grants might be extended for a further one or two years.

  "By using the existing grants process to purchase some services we will be increasing  our capacity to extend case coordination to a broader client group of new and recent  arrivals," Mr Ruddock said. 

  ''The effectiveness of this interim measure for providing services will determine how we  proceed with the Strategy's implementation in the longer term."
