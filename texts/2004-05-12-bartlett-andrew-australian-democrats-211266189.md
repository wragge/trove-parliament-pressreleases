 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/383 WEDNESDAY 12 MAY 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS AND IMMIGRATION & MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS SPOKESPERSON  Democrats Condemn New Detention Centre Proposals The Australian Democrats condemn the Government's decision to build a two new detention centres in Melbourne and Brisbane. Senator Andrew Bartlett, leader of the Democrats and spokesperson for Immigration said, "I am appalled that the government is intending to spend $142.5 million over the next four years to keep asylum seekers locked up.  "In the past three years we have estimated that this Government has already wasted $230 million on building detention centres which only serves to destroying the lives of people.1 "The administrative reasons for detention are not only false but the costs far outweigh the purported benefits. "Even for those who are eventually allowed to apply to enter Australia, the majority of them are left traumatised, unsupported and uncertain of their future while Australia provides temporary 'protection'.  "This Government deliberately creates dysfunctional members of our community - at our expense. "By abolishing the current system of mandatory detention and the Pacific Solution we have also estimated that $120 million could be saved and instead redirected into health and education programs for refugees. "The biggest disgrace of our 'pro-family' Government is the women and children put in housing who are deliberately being kept apart from husbands and fathers in Australia.  "We call on the Federal Government to reunite these families now and release all families from detention centres".
