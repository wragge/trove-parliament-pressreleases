 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday 23 April 2014   

 Abbott must be upfront with UN and Australian public    

 “The Abbott Government cannot continue to snub its nose at the United Nations and shirk its  responsibility to refugee families in need,” said Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, Australian Greens  spokesperson for immigration.    

 “Turning women and children away when they arrive on our doorstep asking for protection is cruel,  inhumane and illegal.   

 “If the government has nothing to hide then it should be upfront with the UN and the Australian public.   

 “The Abbott Government's arrogant and brutish behaviour is compromising Australia’s standing in the  region and tarnishing our international reputation.    

 “At a time when the world is facing a humanitarian crisis we should be extending a hand to those in need,  not locking the door and throwing away the key.   

 “Australia cannot continue to isolate itself from the region or the world.    

 “We must take our fair share and help carry the burden by increasing the number of refugees we take. “
