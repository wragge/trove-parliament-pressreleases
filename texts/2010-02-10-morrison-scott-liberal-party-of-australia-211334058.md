 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  Wed, 10th February 2010  

 RUDD FAILS NATIONAL SECURITY 

 The Rudd Government put political expedience above national security in their  special deal on the Oceanic Viking, based on evidence presented at Senate  Estimates, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said  today.  

 “It is clear from the evidence presented at Senate Estimates that the only reason  refugees given adverse security assessment by ASIO were transferred from  Indonesia to Australia was because of Kevin Rudd’s special deal for the Oceanic  Viking,” Mr Morrison said.  

 “The decision to transfer those with an adverse security assessment was made by  the National Security Committee of which the Prime Minister was a member,” he  said.  

 “Officials confirmed that it was not usual practice to transfer refugees who had been  given an adverse security clearance by ASIO, from another country to Australia.  Worse still, the security implications do not appear to have been considered in  deciding whether to enter into an agreement with the Indonesian Government to  offer those on the Oceanic Viking a special deal.  

 “It is clear from this that the Government sought and secured an arrangement with  Indonesia that required Australia to take responsibility for people they knew nothing  about, without any regard for potential security risks.  

 “National security was traded for the PM’s own political expediency.  

 “This was highly unusual and occurred with the direct sign off of senior Cabinet  Minsters as well as the Prime Minister’s own National Security Adviser. Yet Mr Rudd  and Government officials continue to deny he had any knowledge of the deal.  

 “Mr Rudd told the Parliament on 29 October, that the National Security Adviser  answers to him. It is extraordinary that the Prime Minister would not seek to be  advised by his own National Security adviser on the security implication of the  special deal offered to the Indonesian Government for those on board the Oceanic  Viking.  

 “If this is true, how could the Prime Minister fail to inform himself and allow such a  trade off of Australia’s national security interests to be compromised without getting  involved.  

 “The Prime Minister and the Government has failed the most important test of  national Government - national security,” Mr Morrison said.  

 A summary of key outcomes revealed at Senate Estimates is noted below:   - The four Tamil refugees given an adverse assessment by ASIO were transferred to  Australia because of the special deal done with Indonesia for the passengers on  board the Oceanic Viking  

 - Officials confirmed that transferring UNHCR mandated refugees with adverse  security assessment from Indonesia to Australia was not usual.  

 - The special deal was signed off by the Border Protection Committee of Cabinet,  chaired by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship.  

 - The National Security Adviser or their deputy attended every one of these  meetings.  

 - The Government continued to deny the PM had any knowledge of the contents of  the special deal, despite the fact his Foreign Minster, Immigration Minister and  National Security Adviser had approved the terms.  

 - The Minister and officials denied that any suggestion, discussion or agreement was  made with respect to Australian responsibility for asylum seekers at the Port of  Merak, in the course of the negotiation in relation to the Oceanic Viking  

 - DIAC was able to develop a manifest of the passengers before they left the vessel.  

 - ASIO had no access to the passengers to enable any assessment to be made of  any risk that may present itself of people on board the vessel if the Australian  Government undertook to take responsibility for them.  

 - Once the adverse security assessments were determined, the Minister for  Immigration and Citizenship was advised.  

 - The decision to transfer the 4 Tamil refugees to Australia was made by the National  Security Committee, whose membership included the Prime Minister and the  National Security Adviser.  

 - The refugees with adverse security findings are now held in the general population  of the detention and alternative detention facilities at Phosphate Hill and  Construction camp sites on Christmas Island.
