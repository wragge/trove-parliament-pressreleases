 English classes - - a simple step to stopping the suffering for refugees The Australian Democrats have called on the Federal Government to allow all refugees equal access to free English classes as a means of assisting them to become self-sufficient taxpayers.

 Senator Andrew Bartlett, Australian Democrats’ spokesperson on Immigration, made the comment while addressing a National Celebration in Adelaide as a lead up to "Refugee Sunday", organised by the National Council of Churches.

 "The Federal Government has deliberately manufactured a humanitarian crisis in our cities by denying refugees basic assistance," said Senator Bartlett.

 "The Democrats call on the Immigration Minister, Mr Ruddock, to recognise the aim of Refugee Sunday, organised by Australia's churches, and make this one small step to reduce the suffering of people who have already endured so much.

 "Refugees in Australia on temporary protection visas do not have access to free English classes. A lack of English makes it almost impossible for people to adapt and find a job.

 "The welfare benefits these refugees receive are very minimal and not enough for them to pay their own way to attend English classes. If the refugees had the opportunity to learn English they would become self-sufficient very quickly. All it takes is the standard 500 hours of English classes for them not to be a burden on the welfare system. Clearly that would be money well spent.

 "It is a well known fact that refugees are willing to find work. In fact they are

 willing to do many jobs that many Australians don't want to do," he said.

 Other problems facing refugees on temporary protection visas include restrictions on their ability to sponsor immediate family members and difficulty in accessing health care, education or housing assistance.

 "Refugee Sunday is a national celebration organised by our churches aimed at raising community awareness about the problems faced by refugees and the organisations trying to assist them," concluded Senator Bartlett.
