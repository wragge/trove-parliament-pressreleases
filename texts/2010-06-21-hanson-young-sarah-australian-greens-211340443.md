 Statement Responding to Reports of a Possible Re-Opening of Woomera Detention Centre 

 Media Release | Spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young

 Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, Greens Spokesperson on Immigration and Human Rights: 

 "Reports suggesting the Immigration department thinks Woomera should be considered as an option for 

 housing asylum-seekers again shows the flawed thinking at the heart of Government policy. 

 "Woomera was a notorious desert prison, a place where vulnerable men, women and children suffered 

 indefinite detention, leading to increases in mental health problems and attempts at self-harm. It was never 

 an appropriate place of detention, and that's still the case now. 

 "Woomera is the wrong option, just like Curtin is the wrong option, and Leonora is the wrong option - 

 asylum-seekers should be brought to metropolitan mainland centres, so their claims can be processed 

 quickly, fairly and humanely and they can be closer to necessary services. 

 "The Government should be looking at Red Cross polling, which shows the Australian people clearly 

 understand the desperate reality of life for those fleeing persecution. 

 "It's shameful that the Government and Coalition are either innocently clueless or wilfully misleading when 

 it comes to their failure to promote this sort of compassion for asylum-seekers. 

 "When 94 per cent of people say that if their lives were under threat they would use every resource to get 

 to a safe country, why do the old parties persist in demonising desperate people who jump on boats 

 seeking protection? 

 "The Greens message to Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott is - listen to the Australian people and stop peddling 

 the politics of fear and false toughness.''
