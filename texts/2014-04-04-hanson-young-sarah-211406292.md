 Cambodia: Morrison’s next dumping ground    

 The Immigration Minister’s plan to dump refugees in Cambodia is irresponsible and absurd, the  Australian Greens have said.    

 “The Government knows Manus Island is untenable and is now scouring the region for the next  poor neighbour to dump refugees on,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young.    

 “Instead of prowling around South-East Asia, setting up one gulag after another, the Abbott  Government should be giving refugees the protection they need.    

 “It seems Cambodia, one of the poorest nations in our region, is the next to be offered the  poison chalice of foreign aid funding for taking Australia’s refugees.    

 “As a wealthy, developed nation that has signed the Refugee Convention, Australia can be far  better than this.    

 “Boosting refugee processing capacity in the region and bringing more people directly to  Australia will save lives and help to protect some of the most vulnerable people in the world.”
