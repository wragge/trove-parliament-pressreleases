 2002-03 Humanitarian Program Restoring the Balance to  Those Most In Need 

 MPS 53/2003 

 Australia has granted the highest number of offshore refugee and humanitarian visas for  five years as a result of the success of the Government's border control strategies,  including the Pacific Strategy, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and  Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, announced today. 

 In the 2002-03 program year, 11,656 visas were granted to people applying overseas  under the Humanitarian Program. (Refer to Table 1 below.) 

 This represented 93 per cent of the total number of 12,525 humanitarian visas granted  during the year.  

 'In the past the large numbers of unauthorised arrivals has meant that Australia could not  take as many people living in often appalling conditions in refugee camps overseas,' Mr  Ruddock said. 

 'However with no boat arrivals for something like 18 months, with the exception of the  Vietnamese vessel that arrived in July, we have been able to focus our resources on  helping those most in need. 

 'Hundreds of additional places are now available offshore for those requiring humanitarian  resettlement from the Middle East and Africa who do not have the resources or  opportunity to engage people smugglers,' the Minister said.  

 In 2003-03 there were 869 protection visas granted onshore - the lowest for more than  five years.  

 'Having more places available offshore also means that refugee and humanitarian visa  processing times offshore have dropped significantly in the past 12 months due to people  having to wait for less time for an available place,' the Minister said. 

 The offshore component of the program has been further boosted by the signing of an  arrangement with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in June  2003 which established procedures to ensure that emergency resettlement cases referred 

 to Australia can be quickly finalised once accepted. 

 'The arrangements reaffirm the close working relationship and the commitment to the  system of international protection shared by Australia and the UNHCR.'

 The Government has also been able to allocate a significant number of program places to  Africa where, according to the UNHCR, most resettlement places are needed.   

 During 2002-03, 48 per cent of the total offshore visas were granted to people from  Africa, followed by 38 per cent from the Middle East and South West Asian regions. 

 The 2002-03 program was able to be delivered despite the unavoidable disruption of  operations at many DIMIA overseas posts due to the conflict in the Middle East and South  West Asia. 

 All of the 12,000 new places made available by the Government for 2002-03 were used  and some additional visas were granted from places carried over from the previous year.
