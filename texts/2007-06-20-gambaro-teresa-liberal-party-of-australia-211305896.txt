 Launch of Australia - a new home  World Refugee Day 2007 

 Parliament House, Canberra  20 June 2007 

 Today is World Refugee Day and it is important for us all to reflect on the  great courage and resilience of refugees world-wide. Most if not all refugees  have experienced trauma, loss and distress beyond our calculation. 

 Today is also an opportunity for Australians to hold their heads up high in the  knowledge that Australia has provided sanctuary and support to over 675,000  refugees and humanitarian entrants since 1945. Australia has offered a  helping hand to those in need and has helped them to build new lives of hope  and promise. 

 It is a proud national record and one the government is committed to maintain. 

 It is important to remember that the United Nations ranks Australia  consistently among the top three refugee resettlement intake countries -  along with Canada and the United States. Australia is among the world’s  leaders in its administration of an orderly refugee intake and resettlement  scheme. 

 These are facts that are too easily overlooked. 

 So it is an absolute pleasure to launch this DVD: Australia - a new home. The  DVD is a world first in assisting the successful resettlement and integration of  refugee and humanitarian entrants from sub-Saharan Africa. 

 The government recognises that one size does not fit all. To give people the  best chance of integrating into mainstream Australia we have to be innovative  in how we provide them with assistance and information. 

 This DVD is a unique resource. It offers newly-arrived refugees and  humanitarian entrants a useful introduction to life in Australia. It explains in 

 English and in six other widely spoken African languages, the facets of  Australian life that many of us take for granted. 

 And it can be used by settlement service providers to deliver orientation  information and advice to new African arrivals. Each new arrival will also  receive a copy of the DVD to watch in their own time. 

 Topics covered on the DVD include renting a home, finding work, learning  English, going to school, budgeting, water safety and childcare. 

 There is also advice on matters such as how to use an ATM, how to make a  doctor’s appointment, obtaining a driver’s licence and the importance of  recycling. 

 There is advice on the separation of powers, freedom of speech and the  equality of men and women. 

 The DVD also features interviews with recent arrivals — such as Senayt  Mebrahtu, who you will meet soon — who offer advice on some of the  opportunities and challenges that may be encountered when settling in  Australia. 

 Senayt will speak about her experience as a young refugee, starting a new life  in Australia. 

 The DVD complements Australia’s existing settlement services such as those  provided under the Australian Cultural Orientation Programme, the Integrated  Humanitarian Settlement Strategy, the Settlement Grants Programme, the  Adult Migrant English Program and the Translating and Interpreting Service. 

 It is not enough just to give people visas to live here. We must also do the  best we can to provide them with the information and skills they need to  participate in the community as soon as possible after arrival. 

 I should mention that this year’s budget included a package worth more than  $209 million to provide additional support to refugees and humanitarian  entrants. 

 I congratulate everyone involved on the development of the DVD, and thank  the many community representatives, service providers and government  agencies who gave their time and expertise. 

 I welcome this DVD as an innovative and exciting resource to help African  refugees to settle in their first few months in Australia. 

 Africa to settle and integrate more quickly into Australian life.
