 Press conference 

 Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York 

 Transcript, E&OE, proof only 

 24 September 2012 

 SENATOR CARR: Ladies and Gentlemen. 

 I'm honoured to be talking to you about something as important as Australia's bid for  the Security Council. We think it's appropriate that Australia put its virtues before the  world. We are a creative middle power and we think that we've got quite a bit to  contribute to discussions in this highest of international fora. 

 It's a matter of Australians being modestly proud of the things we do around the  world. The fact that we fund the training of police in the Pacific; that our nurses work  in Cambodia to train midwives to bring down the rate of maternal deaths; that we  contribute to peacekeeping, in an exemplary fashion if you look at the Solomons or  East Timor. The fact that we are the biggest non-NATO contributor in Afghanistan -  doing our bit in very challenging and sometimes awful circumstances to build peace  in that country. That we make a contribution to inter-faith understanding around the  world - reflecting our multiculturalism. 

 I make the point when we put Australia's case that we are not America, we are not  Europe. We're a multicultural country between the Indian and Pacific Oceans and  we've got our own perspective to put to the world. We're a creative middle power  that, it might be said, punches above its weight. And we haven't been on the Security  Council from the mid-80s. 

 That's our case. 

 It is hard going to get Australia up in any ballot whether it's to host an international  sporting event or to do something like this, because we are not part of a trading bloc  or a cooperative bloc of nations. It's not as if we are going into the ballot as a South  American nation with the almost guaranteed support of every Latin American country  or as a member of ASEAN with a bloc of ten votes behind us, or as a member of the  European Union. Australia is not part of a bloc. 

 The other challenge is that we took our merits into this race sometime after our  competition declared that they were in the race, six or five years after they had made  their declaration. And many nations have already committed to the people we're  running against. But in good spirits we're in this race as a long term supporter, in fact  a foundation member, of the United Nations. 

 QUESTION: Senator, what do you make of Tony Abbotts comments back home in  Australia, beside the fact they are [inaudible] what do you make of the general  attitude that this isn't a priority and we should be directed to talking about boat  people? 

 SENATOR CARR: I just tell Tony Abbot he's too fixated on the Anglosphere. We're  engaging with the world at the United Nations. I've got a meeting with the Gulf  Cooperation Council - I'm chairing the meeting. Later in the week I'll be chairing a  meeting of the Commonwealth - there are fifty-five nations in the Commonwealth and  about twenty of them are small island states. We've got the endorsement of the  fifteen nations of the Caribbean. They like us. And we've got much support from  African countries and at a recent meeting with African countries in Perth talking  about our common interest in mining, I was able to say to them, "We're Australia, we  are not Europe, we are not America we've got our own perspective and we want to  build cooperative partnerships with you." 

 Tony Abbot understands none of this. Tony Abbott sees Australia as being part of  the Anglosphere, being comfortable with our friends, our long term friends the other  old dominions, but not looking to the rest of the world. And if Tony Abbott became  Prime Minister of Australia still talking about the Anglosphere and saying we  shouldn't be talking to the rest of the world; that we shouldn't be moving outside our  region, it would send the message that Australia had gone back to its colonial  origins, we are retreating from Asia, retreating from Africa, retreating from Latin  America where we've got terrific relationships. 

 QUESTION: Do you actually think we are punching above our weight because there  have been some senior Australians, just quietly, who have said we are naÃ¯ve to still  think that? 

 SENATOR CARR: Well we are the thirteenth largest economy in the world; we are a  member of the G20. We took - this is Kevin Rudd's work - we took a lead role in  expanding the East Asia Summit by getting the admission of America and Russia.  These were big, and with the establishment of G20, these were major diplomatic  achievements by Australia. In terms of aid we are variously measured as being the  eighth or the ninth biggest contributor in the world. That's punching above our  weight. 

 QUESTION: [Inaudible] 

 SENATOR CARR: No, that is precisely confirmation that we are punching about our  weight. The fact that we are the largest non-NATO contributor in Afghanistan  confirms that too. I think the access I've seen Australia enjoy, getting a meeting with  the new president of Egypt three weeks ago, confirms that the world is ready to  engage with Australia. 

 QUESTION: What about the Prime Minister's role in advocating the Millennium  Development Goals, did that lose a bit of clout given the slippage in our timetable for  meeting those set goals? 

 SENATOR CARR: Well no because so many nations had actually cut their aid  budget, we've actually increased ours. We've increased ours. In the last budget aid  went up another $300 million. That was on top of some very steep increases in the  previous years and that's acknowledged. There are other countries - I'm not going to  mention them, that might be considered impolite - that have actually cut their aid  budgets because of these things we are all grappling with, the slowing of the world  economy. 

 QUESTION: What conditions do we attach to our aid to Middle Eastern countries  where there has clearly been a change of attitude and temperature in regard to  America's role in the region and leaders like Mohammed Morsi saying America  needs to change the way it engages in the region? 

 SENATOR CARR: Well we provided humanitarian assistance to the people of Libya  when they were pulling out of a very destructive civil war. We see it's a standard  tradition in fact that none of our aid would ever reach and organisation associated  with terrorism. One aspect of aid to the Middle East that I'm very proud of, that all  Australian's can be proud of, is our support for those wretched, suffering refugees in  camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. They are being forced to flee over the border  from Syria where their homes are being bombed, their neighbours, family members  killed. Australia - this is another example of us punching above our weight - Australia  is the fourth largest contributor in aid to the Syrian refugees. 

 QUESTION: You're meeting with the Palestinian delegates today in light of the riots  in Middle East. What is Australia's stance on their push for greater recognition in the  United Nations, and will you be supporting their push to become a non-member  state? 

 SENATOR CARR: We would need to see the resolution. No resolution has been  presented. We want a two-state solution and the two-state solution of course  requires concessions on both sides. Our favoured position is to get the two sides  talking to one another; that's what we want to see most of all. So we're looking for  wording on that and I'll draw your attention that I think on a total of nine UN  resolutions since 2007 Australia has changed its voting position. 

 QUESTION: Senator you mention that Finland and Luxemburg have got five years  head start on Australia in terms of this contest for this seat, these seats. How do you  rate Australia's chances at the moment and how significant is that five year gap  really? 

 SENATOR CARR: Well it's a very fair question but it's hard to say because we can  get a sympathetic hearing from a foreign minister from a country that seems well  disposed to us but that's got to translate itself into a voting decision in a secret ballot  on October the eighteenth here. There is, in previous ballots for the Security Council,  a phenomenon, I guess you would call it, of promised support being somewhat  higher than support that's actually recorded for a candidate on the day. This is a  phenomenon not unknown in ballots for caucus positions and other contests in  politics. 

 QUESTION: You mentioned that Tony Abbot signalled a possible return to our  colonial past or words to that effect. Isn't that over cooking it a bit, he was just sort of  highlighting the need to focus on our region as a priority? 

 SENATOR CARR: He keeps returning to this idea of the anglo-sphere, that's what  I'm referring to the anglo-sphere. Like an infant reaching for its mother's skirts.  You've got to see what he said recently in the context of that longing for an old  colonial relationship where Australia thinks only of its great and powerful friends. 

 I've got to tell you that we've got good lines of communication with diverse countries  and they appreciate it when we say, "We are not America, we are not Europe, we're  Australia with our own perspective as a creative middle power, our own perspective  on the world." 

 That's why we engage with Africa. Like getting that conference a month ago of  African ministers and officials in Perth talking about what we've got in common in  managing mining. That's why we are running cooperative work on climate change  with the small island states. Over twenty nations in the Commonwealth fit that  description: small island states. The reason we have been endorsed by the fifteen  islands of the Caribbean is that they see that all these things are true, that Australia's  not America, not Europe and we have got a sympathy with small and medium-sized  countries, small island states included. That's what we're engaged in. And that's a  contrast to Tony Abbott who says we shouldn't be talking to Africa. 

 I think he got caught out badly by the way, I've got to say this in saying the Prime  Minister should be up in Indonesia talking to the President and not in New York,  when the President of Indonesia arrived in New York on the same day as our Prime  Minister. 

 QUESTION: Well you will be seeing the President of Indonesia tonight, how do you  expect that conversation to go in the context of … [inaudible]? 

 SENATOR CARR: It's not a formal meeting with him, it's a tribute to him. And of  course I'm going to be there for my interest not only in Indonesia as Foreign Minister  but my interest in the nature conservation agenda. It's a meeting sponsored by the  Nature Conservancy and the World Wildlife Fund to pay tribute to a leader from a  developing country who has made a stand in the nature conservation cause and  battle. 

 QUESTION: Would you expect the asylum issue to come up in that conversation? 

 SENATOR CARR: I wouldn't think so, I really wouldn't think so. But we've had a lot  of engagement with Indonesia, most recently with a Ministerial visit about safety at  sea issues. 

 QUESTION: Relying on the sympathy vote is not normally seen as a really strong  suit to play … 

 SENATOR CARR: Nor is talking up your prospects wildly and extravagantly, so let  me fall between the two. 

 QUESTION: There seems to be an effort to prepare us for another disappointment. 

 SENATOR CARR: No. I think both the contentions I put to you are easily defended.  It is tough for Australia in international ballots, if some of you took an interest in sport  you'd know what I'm talking about. And second, we did get into the race a little after  our major competitors. 

 QUESTION: Minister, what would you say to those who ask why we're spending  money on something like this and … [inaudible]? 

 SENATOR CARR: Well the answer is this. 

 We are proud, in a modest way, of what we do as Australians. 

 We are proud of the people, our police in the Solomon Islands who brought order to  a place that was being torn apart by civil war with armed gangs firing at one another  from different ends of the streets in Honiara. We are proud of what our people did in  East Timor. We are proud of what they are doing under enormous pressure trying to  get more girls to school in Afghanistan, and protecting people from terrorists and  getting Al Qaeda uprooted and out of that country. We are proud of what we are  doing training midwives in Cambodia. We are proud of Australia's civilised voice in  the councils of the world. We are proud of our multiculturalism which is something of  a shining beacon to the world. A lot of the world is interested in how we manage the  great diversity of races and peoples and faiths that Australia can boast after decades  of ambitious immigration. 

 QUESTION: Senator Carr, the fact that the alternative Government of Australia  opposes our bid for the Security Council is that hamstringing our efforts at all? Has  that been raised? 

 SENATOR CARR: No, I see no evidence of that. To be fair to them - and I strive to  be fair to the Coalition - they've said at different times they've supported the bid. 

 QUESTION: Could I ask you a question on a sort of domestic matter? I did come to  this party late so forgive me if this has been asked before. 

 SENATOR CARR: Sure 

 QUESTION: Considering that you've been down this path yourself, there are reports  of Morris Iemma running for Federal Parliament in the seat of Barton if Robert  McClelland retires what advice would you give him? 

 SENATOR CARR: First of all I would make no assumptions about Robert  McClelland, a trusted and respected colleague, retiring. If he were to retire, then I  couldn't think of a better candidate than Morris Iemma. I think Morris Iemma was an  honest and industrious premier who was badly treated by my party. I think nothing  was gained for the party by replacing him as leader especially in those  circumstances. Morris Iemma got electricity privatisation absolutely right and could  not have done more to have persuaded the party to a sane course. I think he would  be an excellent candidate and all that experience in state politics certainly counts. 

 QUESTION: Senator, do you think Mohammed Morsi, not Morris Iemma, has a point  about America's posture in the Middle East and/or is he just providing cover for  violent extremists with his remarks? 

 SENATOR CARR: I think President Morsi has got a very, very difficult job. You've  got to look at the divisions in Egypt reflected in that vote of the last election. What  he's doing, and I admire him for this, is providing more energetic leadership for Egypt  than it's had for decades. 

 I think he deserves to be praised for that brave speech he gave in Tehran on Syria. I  think he deserves to be praised for saying he wants to be President of all Egyptians,  that he heads a democratic country and a civil government. He's the first  democratically elected leader in Egyptian history. He's the first civilian leader in  memory. 

 QUESTION: What about his position though that there shouldn't be a Christian as  leader of Egypt and there shouldn't be a women as a leader of Egypt? 

 SENATOR CARR: There are cultural differences here but I'm not commenting on  the internal affairs, the internal politics of Egypt. I'm just saying that the west needs  to be open to someone who's been elected by his people in the first democratic  election they have ever had. And we've got to engage with him. Clearly we've got to  engage with him, that's the position of the United States, but it's our position - it's an  Australian position - we engage with this government. 

 QUESTION: How do we meet this fellow though? I mean we've got a female Prime  Minister and a presumably Christian Prime Minister, I mean how do we engage with  this fellow? 

 SENATOR CARR: I think you ought to reflect on what he's actually said and done as  President. 

 QUESTION: Senator Carr, the notion of a law or an international convention against  blasphemy has been mooted before, there's talk of it apparently among some of the  Arab world at this assembly currently going to be raised in some speeches, what is  your view on any such notion? 

 SENATOR CARR: Well, we reject it. I don't believe you can have religious anti-vilification laws and religious anti-defamation or anti-blasphemy laws without  restricting freedom of speech. 

 No matter what your faith, it's possible to be offended by artworks or parodies that  touch on religious themes or religious values. But I don't think banning it is  compatible with the Western tradition, the Western approach. 

 I think nothing would worsen religious differences, the gaps between the faiths, than  hauling people into court and putting them in prison or fining them because of things  they say about other religions, about other faiths. Because that's what you're going  to be doing with such a law, fining people or putting them in gaol if they express a  blasphemous or a disrespectful view about another religion. 

 I just don't think that's feasible. 

 Thank you. Thanks folks.
