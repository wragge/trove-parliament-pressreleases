 THE HON DR SHARMAN STONE MP  Federal Member for Murray  Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

     Tuesday 30 June 2009 

 

 Indonesia warns 10,0000 asylum seekers waiting to come to Australia   

 The warning by Indonesian authorities yesterday that up to 10,000 asylum seekers are waiting  in Malaysia to make the journey to Australia sends a message there is an urgent need for the  Rudd Labour Government to re think its softened border protection policy.   

 “It is crystal clear to everyone except the Rudd Government that now is the not the time to  further unravel migration policy.   

 Dr Sharman Stone, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship called on the Rudd  Government to immediately reverse decisions that have left us with a softened border  protection policy.   

 “The softening of our border protection policy since August last year has resulted in a surge  of 23 boats with over 1000 asylum seekers arriving in Australia during that time.    

 “The Rudd Government should consider increasing the penalties for people smuggling. The  current $200,000 maximum fine is clearly inadequate when more that one million dollars can  be earned in a single boat voyage.   

 “The time is now long past for Minister Evans to continue to sit on his hands while thousands  put their lives at risk.     

 “Clearly the Australian migration policy is now in chaos; our border protection policy is in  tatters, with a well oiled pipeline delivering millions of dollars to criminals while lives are put  in peril,” Sharman Stone said.
