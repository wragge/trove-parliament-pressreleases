 Trafficking in Women for Prostitution  Speech by Ms Kathleen Maltzahn   Australian Women Conference  Canberra, August 28, 2001 

 This afternoon's session aims to examine systematic approaches to violence against women,  and I'll be talking about an area where we find an extremely organised, very systematic  approach to violence against women - that of trafficking in women for prostitution.  Unfortunately, the systematic approach is in perpetrating the violence, not, at least in this  country, in combating it, and in that it stands in contrast to the issues Julie and Christine have  been discussing. 

 Trafficking in women for prostitution is a strange issue in that it is both huge and growing, and  underground and invisible. In that it has many similarities to issues like domestic and sexual  violence, but it is different in that it is not simply a global issue in terms of affecting many 

 women from all over the world, but in that it also moves women around the world. It has all  the hidden-ness of a 'domestic' issue, with the complexities of a cross-border, international  one. 

 Today, as we talk about trafficking in women for prostitution, I'd like to start with what is often  the most invisible side of this hidden industry - the 'customer'. In the Philippines in the early to  mid-nineties, when feminist work on trafficking and prostitution was taking off, one of the main  thrusts of advocacy work was to move the discussion from what seems to be a universal  near-obsession with the women involved - why they enter, why they stay, why they come  back, as if individual women's circumstances dictate their experiences in and the running of  the sex industry. Instead, Filipino feminists called for a more accurate discussion about the  whole industry, what they dubbed the 3Bs. 

 Business, Buyer, Bought  The three Bs were the business - the multi-national, multi-billion dollar industry where the  orchestrators - the traffickers, pimps, procurers, managers, owners, pornographers and so on  - benefit hugely financially from the sale of women; the buyers - overwhelmingly men, who put  the demand into the 'supply and demand' equation, and benefit both personally and politically  from the use of women in prostitution; and the bought - the women who, as the raw materials  of the sex industry, are consistently the lat to benefit.  

 In my talk today, as we explore ways to respond systematically to violence against women  through trafficking, I'll be trying to keep a focus on all of these three parts of the industry - the  business, the buyer and the bought - and so I'd like to start, if you will, from one of our 

 sponsors - the 'customer'. 

 This is an extract from an article in the Sunday Age Magazine earlier this year, titled 'Why  Men Pay for Sex'. And before I start, I should add that all names in this article have been  changed, to protect … well, I'll leave it to you to decide who is being protected. 

 James Ogilvy, 51, says his regular visits to sex workers stem from a self-analysis as a  "borderline fetishist". … Colleagues at the financial institution where he works have no idea  Ogilvy is aroused by, what he calls, 'exotic' women. That his wife is a blond-haired, blue-eyed  English woman began to present a problem two years ago when his longing for someone  'different' became so overpowering that sex with his wife became difficult … 

 So, an average fortnight involves at least one interaction with a sex worker. He makes regular  use of an agency that specialises in 'exotic beauties'. African, Asian, Indian and even  southern European women make the grade. Ogilvy has justified it to some extent and feels 

 less guilty because there is such a point of difference. 'If I was after blue-eyed blonds but just  didn't want my wife, I think it would be worse,' [he says].  

 James Ogilvy is not alone in constructing prostitution in a racialised - racist - manner. Recent  research on sex trafficking in the US used the Internet to access men's accounts of using 

 women in prostitution. Of 298 men, 196 (66%) identified either the nationality or ethnicity of  the individual women they used, and/or the composition of the women at the venue the  women came from . 

 Race, difference and women  Clearly, when it comes to the sex industry, race matters to men. Difference matters. And what  this says, I believe, is that trafficking is not simply about meeting the demand for prostitution 

 in countries where women aren't coming forward in large enough numbers (although it is  worth asking why there aren't enough women in countries like Australia, given that the sex  industry tells us that prostitution is good employment for women). Trafficking is also very  much about accessing a specific sort of woman. 'Exotic' women, 'different' women, and  surprise surprise, women from the global 'south' who are seen (and I stress seen) to be more  compliant, less powerful, easier to use. 

 Trafficking globally   What this helps create - and it is clearly not the only factor - is a massive trade in women  internationally. The statistics are overwhelming, and they go on and on. Here are a few: 

 â¢ the United Nations estimates that trafficking is a US$5-7 billion operation annually,  with 4 million people moved from one country to another and within countries each  year ;  

 â¢ the US government estimates that 50,000 women and children are trafficked in the  US each year ;  

 â¢ 500,000 women are trafficked for prostitution in Western Europe each year ; and,  significantly  

 â¢ traffickers can make five to twenty times as much money from a woman as they paid  for her - unlike drugs, women can be re-sold multiple times, and there are  considerably fewer risks of being caught, prosecuted or convicted than if they are  doing drug or arms trafficking.  

 Trafficking in Australia  And what is the situation here in Australia? 

 â¢ in Melbourne, in one case alone, trafficker Gary Glazner brought in between 20 and  40 Thai women;  

 â¢ in 1998-1999, 243 people, overwhelmingly women , were deported from this country  having been located in brothels, up from 56 in 1996-97 . It is impossible to know how  many more were not detected. In the UK, it is estimated that that only a tenth of  trafficked women are actually detected (and that assumes you are looking for them in  the first place); and  

 â¢ Government estimates put the gross cash flow to organises of the Australian sex  industry at A$1 million a week.  

 Despite this, and despite the fact that Australia was one of the first countries in the world to  respond to trafficking for prostitution with new legislation, there is no real response to this  issue, let alone a systematic one that might make a difference. 

 'Removals'   The closest things we have to system in our approach is the Department of Immigration's  response. DIMA regularly apprehends women in brothels without working visas and  systematically 'removes' them from Australia. We have no idea how many of these women  might be trafficked, because DIMA doesn't ask them. Instead, it returns them to the country  on their passport, without finding out first how they got here, without linking them in with  support services at the other end, without asking them if they have been a victim of crime.  Without a doubt, they are returning trafficked women to the place where they were vulnerable 

 to trafficking in the first place, back to the place where they possibly still have huge debts to  the initial trafficker.  

 Even leaving these humanitarian concerns aside, DIMA is also losing a unique opportunity to  find out more about trafficking in this country and locate women who may wish to press  charges against their traffickers. This is not an impossible task - I'll talk a little later about  successful approaches in other countries that find offering women support makes a huge  difference in their willingness to testify. Given this, it is hard to understand the logic behind  DIMA's approach. Unless we take it to mean that they don't think trafficking for prostitution is  a problem worth seriously investigating, which perhaps translates as trafficked women don't  really matter. To quote an ex-Federal Policeman's account of some of his colleagues views  (and not, I should stress his own), after all, 'they're just fucking molls'. And of course we can  add, in this country, overwhelmingly Asian 'molls' to boot. 

 The Glazner trafficking case in Melbourne   In 1998-1999, of the 243 people deported in prostitution-related cases, all but two were from  Asia. And what do we know about these women and what happens to them? Let us look for a  minute at the majority, the 130 identified as Thai. In the most documented Australian  trafficking case we have, the Glazner case in Melbourne, the women were required to do 500 

 free half-hour 'services', and were under contract for 12 months. Glazner held their passports,  and their freedom of movement was severely curtailed. The only two women who testified at  the committal hearing - all the others had been deported - said they feared they would be  killed. Recent articles in The Age talks of violence including someone's fingers being cut off,  and children being threatened. The terms used to differentiate between those women under  contract in the brothels Glazner operated and those not said it all. The Thai women Glazner 

 brought in were 'the contract girls'. The rest were called 'freedom girls'.  

 Interestingly, while the prosecution in this trial were successfully able to argue that Glazner's  trafficking activities should be part of the evidence, rather than simply the breach of  prostitution regulations he was charged with, there was no scope in the trial for examining the  conditions from which the women were trafficked. There was no discussion of why women  would 'consent' to do 500 prostitution jobs for no money. There was no discussion of what  their other options might be - or indeed if they had any. It's worth noting that the new UN  Optional Protocol on Trafficking says that trafficking is not only about coercion and force. A  woman can also be said to be trafficked in terms of abuse of vulnerability. Unfortunately, our  new legislation does not include this element, and there was no consciousness of this in the  trial. Rather, it was accepted that for some reason, Thai women 'willingly' enter into situations  that Australian women would reject. As James Ogilvy told us at the beginning, some women  are 'different'.  

 Thai and Burmese trafficked women  But if we are looking at trafficking, we have to do what that court refused to do, and what our  current legislation side-steps, and look at the other end, where women are trafficked from.  Firstly, in the case of women on Thai passports, it is important to say that many of them won't  be Thai. A significant proportion are women from Burma, who have either been trafficked from  Burma into the Thai sex industry, or who have fled Burma and then been recruited. Either  way, these women leave an environment of incredible violence and abuse under one of the  most brutal regimes in the world, and come to a country that does not want them. Refugees  from Burma found outside established refugee camps in Thailand face arrest and deportation.  They are not allowed to work legally, and so end up in dangerous and difficult work that no  one else will do. The sex industry capitalises on this. It is worth asking how the sex industry  would fare if it had to recruit women without the aid of war and poverty, hunger and  homelessness, incest, other rape and domestic violence. It is human rights violations such as  these that vastly increases the vulnerability of women to trafficking. 

 Sex Tourism  It is also worth adding at this point that these things do not happen in isolation in supposedly  poor, third world countries. We don't have to wait till women turn up here to see an Australian  involvement. The role of Australian sex tours, for example, in increasing the sex industry in  countries like the Philippines is well-documented - and also has clear links to violence against  Filipino women in this country, particularly against so called 'mail order brides'. And sex 

 tourism and the involvement of Australians in foreign sex industries is not an issue of the past.  When the US military pulled out its military bases in the Philippines in the 1990s, it left behind  a huge 'rest and recreation' industry that had sprung up to catered to US serviceman.  Australians rushed into fill the gap the US had left. They bought up the sex industry  infrastructure - hotels, strip clubs, travel agents - and in Angeles City, are now a highly  organised force that controls well over 80% of the sex industry.  

 As we can see from this, and as I mentioned at the beginning, the sex industry is both  organised and international. Its 'businessmen', for want of a better word, work across  countries, and both bring customers in from one country to another, and move women to  meet customer's demands. I remember seeing a menu in a Philippines bar in Angeles owned  by one of the Australians I just mentioned that symbolised this. It had American snacks, Thai 

 soups, Filipino noodles, and vegemite toast for breakfast. 

 In contrast to the traffickers, efforts in Australia to combat trafficking have to date been  piecemeal, uncoordinated and geographically limited. It may be comforting to know that until  recently, we weren't alone in this. Most 'receiving' countries were similarly committed to  closing their eyes and hoping the problem would just go away. It hasn't of course, and the 

 sheer scope of the problem is forcing countries like the US, UK and European nations to  really start thinking about how to respond. In Australia we seem still to have our eyes shut. I'm  hoping that we will open them and try to respond before, as in Europe and the UK, the  numbers are so overwhelming that it is incredibly difficult. What this means, however, is that  there are some new initiatives that we can learn from, and I'd like to explore some of these,  and how they tie in with the Australian situation.  

 Ways Forward  UN Optional Protocol on Trafficking in Women and Children  One of these initiatives is the Optional Protocol on Trafficking in Women and Children I  mentioned earlier. This is in many ways a ground-breaking agreement. Apart from anything, it  looks at trafficking in its totality, and was agreed upon by both receiving and sending  countries. It gives a shared definition of trafficking, something that until now has eluded us,  and that in turn provides a framework for working with people in all parts of the trafficking  journey - in sending, transit and receiving countries. The protocol is also important in saying  that trafficked women and children are victims of a crime, and not criminals, and it suggests  that receiving countries look at allowing trafficked women to stay in their country if they testify  - an interesting suggestions that needs further consideration in our context. If we are looking  for a systematic response to trafficking, the Optional Protocol is a good way forward. Australia  has not yet had a chance to ratify the Protocol - the question is whether it will once it has had  the chance.  

 The framework we currently have is legislative, through the sexual slavery and servitude  offences that were introduced in 1999. Against the Optional Protocol, this legislation falls  somewhat short, but it has failed even to live up to its own standards. There have been no  prosecutions. Clearly, a response to trafficking must include prosecution of traffickers.  

 Policing Trafficking   This in turn needs a police response to trafficking. Recent research in the United Kingdom  shows that police districts with vice squads have significantly greater knowledge of and  awareness of trafficking for prostitution. The UK report states that 'where there is a reactive,  nuisance based, response to prostitution it is less likely that trafficked women will be detected.  The conditions under which they exist, alongside a fear of the authorities ... means that few  will come forward for help. Police forces that insist they have no problem must ask  themselves, whether, unintentionally, they are creating 'areas of tolerance' for trafficking.' This  has interesting implications in somewhere like Victoria, where regulation of the industry has  been almost entirely removed from police hands.  

 Trafficking is a crime where the obstacles to victim testimony are significant. In the UK  research finds that only a small minority testify - the rest ask to be deported, preferably within  48 hours, 'fearful that their exploiters will think they have given evidence against them, and  carry out threats made to themselves and their families.' Clearly trauma from violence  experienced also impacts on their choices. Interestingly, however, the research also states 

 that in countries where there are specialist non-government organisations who offer support,  up to 50% of women testify. In Australia, the lack of government support for organisations  such as Project Respect undercuts attempts to support potential witnesses. Project Respect  believes that policing alone cannot address trafficking - policing must be complemented by  specialist NGOs such as Project Respect who can offer support to women outside the  prosecution process.  

 Even with such support, however, there are other significant obstacles regarding victim  testimony, including the difficulty of guaranteeing witness protection if women return home. In  this context, the UK Metropolitan Police's Clubs and Vice Unit (CO14) has made its primary  concern regarding trafficking to 'ensure the rescue and safety of the women (or children). The  success of the investigation - to the extent that it is possible to make arrests and seize assets  - is secondary.  

 The approach uses a 'practical human-rights based approach in seeking to support women in  situations where they have limited options. Policing trafficking requires being able to address  women's fears and concerns, and this can be time and resource intensive. Where women  request to return home, CO14 work with immigration to facilitate this in a way which retains as  much dignity and confidentiality as possible.... They also endeavour to make links with NGOs  and/or embassy staff in the country of origin to extend the woman's options.' Working in this  way addresses the problem that simply detecting and removing women (as the Australian  Department of Immigration currently tends to do) may unintentionally increase demand.  

 Direct Services  The UK model shows the importance of support for trafficked women and children. Project  Respect is one of the few organisations in Australia that seeks out trafficked women and tries 

 to offer them information and support. At present, however, we receive no government  support for this work. This is in contrast to Europe. Driven by necessity perhaps rather than  inclination, European governments have dramatically changed their approach to trafficked 

 women. With the massive influx of trafficked women, they have realised that there will be no  end to trafficking without support for the women themselves. Consequently, trafficked women  in Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands are offered shelter, protection, and residential permits,  in the hope that they will help identify and prosecute traffickers. This strategy is proving  successful. In Italy, women have helped identify about 1,500 pimps and traffickers. At least  800 suspects are under arrest, facing up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Clearly, potential  prosecutions are not the only reason for resourcing NGOs to support trafficked women. A  basic concern for human rights demands this. But the success of the European experiments  is another, compelling reason for consider this.  

 Study Tour  Finally, I'd like to mention an Australian initiative that Project Respect and partners in  Australia and the Philippines are conducting. In June/July 2002, we will be conducting a Study 

 Tour on Trafficking, to be held in the Philippines. The Study Tour will give Australian-based  people the chance to learn about trafficking from the other side, from 'sending' countries, to  help us understand how and why women are recruited, and what countries such as the  Philippines are doing about it. It will be a unique opportunity to learn about this issue from  both ends of the trafficking equation, and we encourage people here today to join the tour.
