 REMOVAL OF CHINESE BOAT PEOPLE

 The return of 113 Chinese boat people from Christmas Island to China within 9 days of  their unauthorised arrival poses the question, why are we going through all this agony if  it can be done so simply and swiftly.

 This is the first reasonable and decisive action taken by the government to recover some  credibility in the refugee determination process since Hawke's ill-judged decision on the  Chinese students.

 The Coalition has been seeking the swift deportation of non bona-fide asylum seekers  and illegal entrants.

 The outcome of protracted applications, further review and appeals suggest that a  majority of other arrivals' claims for refugee status, as defined by the United Nations  Convention, are unfounded.

 Appropriate, thorough and sympathetic investigation of claims for asylum should separate  those who are in genuine need of protection from those who are simply seeking to  manipulate our compassion for economic gain.

 The Government's unwillingness to send a clear and unambiguous signal to others  contemplating unauthorised fentry, has resulted in the long-term detention of several  hundred boat people. Such unconscionable action has irreparably damaged Australia's  reputation as a compassionate and humane society.

 The psychological damage to those who have been detained for long periods of time is  becoming a m atter of very real concern.

 Prompt decision making and quick removal of non bona-fide asylum seekers is the only  fair and appropriate response. It is the only response that protects Australia's interests  and integrity of its borders, and it is the only response, in the long term, that is fair to  any unauthorised entrant.

 The Government has acted properly in the decision it has taken in regard to the 113  arrivals on Christmas Island. With reports of more boats on the way, it is hoped that they  continue to be firm in their resolve.
