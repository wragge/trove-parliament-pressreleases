 Ingrid Betancourt - four years captive  23rd Feb 06   

 International action needed for Colombian peace, hostage release     

 Today is the fourth anniversary of the kidnapping of former Greens presidential  candidate, Ingrid Betancourt, and her campaign manager Clara Rojas by FARC  guerillas. Both remain captive with over 5000 other people, some held for more than  eight years.    

 International action is essential to break the impasse in Colombia and the first step is  to initiate a peace process with a humanitarian agreement and hostage exchange,  Greens leader Bob Brown said today.    

 “Human rights abuses including kidnapping, murder, extortion and illegal land seizure  are rife in Colombia,” Senator Brown said.    

 “Colombia is second only to Sudan in numbers of refugees, with three million people  forcibly internally displaced in the last three years.”    

 In November 2005, 14 Greens from 10 countries including Australia and Taiwan held  the first Global Greens conference for the liberation of the hostages, a humanitarian  accord and human rights in Colombia.     

 Today, Greens around the world including New Zealand, Japan, France and Colombia  will mark the anniversary of Ingrid’s kidnapping.    

 The FARC guerillas have refused all communication from Ingrid and Clara since  August 2003 but both are believed to be alive.    

 “The situation in Colombia is intolerable but receives little attention compared with  other humanitarian tragedies.    

 “Ingrid Betancourt symbolises the plight of all the victims and Greens globally are  initiating a new campaign for international action on Colombia”, said Senator Brown.
