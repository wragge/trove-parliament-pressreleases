 Philip Ruddock MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS  AFFAIRS

 Statement by the Acting Minister for  Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon Daryl Williams AM QC MP

 Support Groups Should Condemn Violence

 MPS 1/2003

 I am concerned about the number of advocacy groups and individuals who are actively or tacitly condoning the actions of  detainees who have been engaging in violence or destruction at detention centres.

 It is unacceptable for advocates to be saying they understand why people are engaging in these acts, because this is giving  comfort and condoning their actions.

 There is no excuse for the lives of other detainees, staff, police and firefighters to be put at risk, nor for the wanton destruction  of public property.

 I am concerned that unless the actions are universally condemned in the strongest manner, the safety and possibly lives of  many people will be put at risk.

 While ever detainees believe their actions are being endorsed, this trouble is likely to continue.

 Australia is a country that believes in the rule of law and the Government will not respond to coercion.
