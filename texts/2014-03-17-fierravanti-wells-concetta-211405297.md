 Celebrating Nowruz

 17 March 2014

 The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services, the Hon Senator Concetta 

 Fierravanti­Wells, today attended Nowruz celebrations with Afghan and Iranian women at the 

 Diamond Palace in Guildford.

 The Senator, who has special responsibility for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services  said, “Today is a very special occasion for the Iranian and Afghan communities, both in 

 Australia and around the world, as you come together to celebrate your hopes for a 

 prosperous new year.”

 “It is also an important occasion for all Australians to share your unique and vibrant cultural  traditions and I acknowledge the organisation of this event by Anglicare. It is yet another 

 example of the rich diversity that both strengthens and unifies this country.”

 Senator Fierravanti­Wells used the occasion to highlight Harmony Day celebrations on 21 

 March.

 “For almost 15 years Harmony Day has shared the message that Everyone Belongs—from the 

 traditional owners of this land, to those who have come here from many countries around the 

 world,” Senator Fierravanti­Wells said.

 “I am pleased to see a record number of Harmony Day celebrations registered this year,  including by the Afghan community in Ingleburn.”

 “As the daughter of migrants myself, I understand the need to belong. It’s something felt in all 

 of us. I understand that migration also brings many challenges, acclimatising to a new 

 language and a new society.”

 Senator Fierravanti­Wells said over the past 20 years new arrivals from Afghanistan and Iran 

 have increasingly contributed to the diversity of Australia.

 “The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that all new migrants are able to  participate in the social, cultural and economic success of this nation. To achieve this we offer 

 settlement services that aim to help refugees and migrants become self­reliant and fully 

 participate in all aspects of Australian life as quickly as possible,” the Senator said.
