 Media Centre  Minister to Visit the Ethnic Communities Council of  Victoria 

 24 October 2005  

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, John Cobb, will  discuss issues affecting newly arrived refugees with the Ethnic  Communities Council of Victoria (ECCV) today. 

 The ECCV is the peak non-government body representing ethnic  communities in Victoria. It was established in 1974 as a voluntary  community organisation. 

 Minister Cobb and the council will discuss the centre’s current projects  and DIMIA’s settlement programs. 

 ‘Australia has a long history of cultural diversity and we have learned to  accept people from different backgrounds whose skills, commitment and  hard work benefit Australia socially, culturally and economically. 

 ‘The council, through its connections and experience with the business,  government and community sectors, is helping Australia make the most  of our cultural diversity.  

 ‘I look forward to meeting the members contributing to this important  work,’ the Minister said. 

 The Minister will visit the Ethnic Communities Council of Victoria,  150 Palmerston St in Carlton on 24 October at 3pm.
