 Memorial Project to Drowned SIEVX  Asylum Seekers   

 

 A national memorial project to commemorate the 353 asylum seekers who lost  their lives when the SIEVX went down in waters between Indonesia and Australia  two years ago, was launched today by Senator Bob Brown and project initiator,  renowned Australian psychologist and author Steve Biddulph.     

 The two-year project, a joint initiative of Rural Australians for Refugees and the  Uniting Church in Australia, invites school students from around the nation to  design a permanent memorial to be built on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin in  Canberra, after approval from ACT Authorities.    

 Called "A Young People's Art Collaboration", the project is non-competitive and  will exhibit designs submitted from schools around the nation in regional and  state capitals. The best elements of the works will then be combined into a  design, which will be an appropriate, evocatively beautiful and educational site in  the national capital.   

 Steve Biddulph said, "It's very important that this huge loss of life, including 146  children and their parents, is known about and remembered. A memorial will give  back a sense that we care about innocent lives, and that our caring doesn't stop  at our own borders. Everyone, regardless of his or her politics, is appalled that  this has happened, and determined it must never happen again."     

 Reverend Rod Horsfield from the Pilgrim Uniting Church in Launceston,  Tasmania added, "We believe Australian people are at heart compassionate and  hospitable.  We want to encourage that spirit and nurture it in the coming 

 generation."   

 Senator Brown said, "We hope that the project will raise awareness of the SIEVX  tragedy. The memorial will be a permanent reminder of the courage of the  families who were on the ship and will help to build compassion for those who  seek safety from persecution, in a younger generation of Australians."
