 Senator Amanda Vanstone  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND  INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS

 Media Centre Refugee information kits

 VPS 077/2004

 Minister for Immigration, Amanda Vanstone, today strongly rejected Opposition criticism of an information  kit for schools about Australia's support for refugees.

 'It seems quite interesting that the Opposition criticises the kit, while the kit itself is designed to present the  facts to Australian schoolchildren about Australia's current and historical support for refugees,' Senator  Vanstone said.

 'I am the first person to encourage frank and open debate about all sorts of issues, including immigration.

 'However, the Opposition and others all too often use the issue of refugee resettlement as a political football.

 'It is important that both sides of the case be told here. Clearly the Opposition isn't going to present the facts.  That places on me, as Minister, a responsibility to ensure that information is available which presents a  balance in the debate.

 'The kit is specifically about refugees, not those who have been assessed and rejected as refugees and who  now are in detention centres. 

 'For example, the fact sheets distributed to schools show that in the past decade Australia has resettled about  100 000 refugees and people whose lives are at risk.

 'The fact sheets also detail the support given to refugees, the differences between asylum seekers and refugees  and some individual case studies.

 'The information is factual and can hardly be criticised as being political.

 'The material has been distributed to about 11 000 schools. Some schools have welcomed the material, others  choose not to use it. That is a choice for individual schools to make.'
