 Minister Urges Support for Refugee Volunteer Groups MPS 18/2002

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today urged advocates who oppose mandatory detention to divert their energies into helping refugees in our community.

 "Australia brings thousands of refugees in through the orderly resettlement program each year and members of community play a major role in helping them settle into their new lives," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Many of those refugees and humanitarian entrants have come from the most appalling conditions in refugee camps in the Middle East and Africa or have witnessed atrocities in the Balkans.

 "Without Australia's resettlement program, many would remain in life threatening situations or face ongoing persecution.

 "Very few would have the resources or opportunity to engage a people smuggler to bring them to Australia.

 "They need a welcoming hand and voluntary groups coordinated through my department under the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy, play a key role in the settlement process.

 "People who claim to have the best interests of refugees at heart could do far more to help refugees and humanitarian entrants coming in from some of the most appalling conditions, if they were to join some of the voluntary groups.

 "Volunteers play a very practical, hands-on role in making refugees and humanitarian entrants feel welcome in our community.

 "If advocates who claim to have the best interests of refugees at heart they would put their signature on a volunteer's application form, rather than a petition calling for an end to mandatory detention.

 "I would urge them to contact my department to see how best they can apply their skills and energies."

 Under its annual offshore Humanitarian Program, Australia welcomes thousands of humanitarian entrants, including refugees, who have faced serious violations of their human rights.

 Many are severely traumatised as a result of their experiences, including persecution and torture, which has caused them to leave their home countries.

 The Government recognises that rebuilding the lives of these people involves far more than securing permanent residence in Australia.

 They must be provided with extra support to enable them to become acquainted with the Australian environment and the services available so that they can fully participate in the Australian community.

 Integrated strategy The new Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS) model helps humanitarian entrants rebuild their lives in Australia by providing them with support designed to meet their initial settlement needs.

 The IHSS provides services to humanitarian entrants through a range

 The Department operates a national telephone inquiry line on 131 881, for the cost of a local call anywhere in Australia. Overseas, please contact your nearest Australian diplomatic office.

 of service providers, many of whom are community based, and volunteers.

 The aim of the IHSS is to help humanitarian entrants achieve self-sufficiency as soon as possible in the settlement process and to distribute resources on a needs basis.

 Emphasis is placed on sensitivity to cultural differences and minimum intrusion into entrants' lives.

 A case-management approach is provided to ensure that the special needs of humanitarian entrants are identified and addressed promptly by matching them with settlement services that meet their particular circumstances.

 In 2001-02 the government will spend $14.3m to provide services to humanitarian entrants.

 Assistance available The IHSS provides settlement support through seven service types. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) has contracted a number of service providers to provide these services. They include:

 Initial Information and Orientation Assistance (IIOA)

 Provides settlement information and case manages entrants so that they are aware of their new environment and are linked to essential services such as income support, Medicare, education and training, employment and the other IHSS services;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Accommodation Support

 Helps entrants to find long term accommodation and, if required, provides interim accommodation; · Household Formation Helps in establishing a household with a basic package of household items;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Early Health Assessment and Intervention

 Helps in overcoming physical and psychological health problems and encourages health care providers to be sensitive to the needs of humanitarian entrants;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 raising community awareness of the refugee experience;

 Proposers' Support

 Provides information to enable proposers of humanitarian entrants to fulfil their undertakings; and

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Service Support

 Helps IHSS contractors with training required to meet their obligations as service providers.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Humanitarian entrants are also provided with pre-embarkation information on issues that are important for their travel to Australia and what to expect on arrival.

 The successful settlement of humanitarian entrants relies on their acceptance by the broader community.

 In this regard, volunteers play a valuable role in making new entrants feel welcome and helping them establish contact with their neighbours, places of worship, sporting organisations and linking them with the relevant ethnic association.

 Volunteers wishing to be involved with the IHSS can contact the Settlement and Multicultural Affairs Section at the nearest Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs office for a list of IHSS service providers for their State or Territory.
