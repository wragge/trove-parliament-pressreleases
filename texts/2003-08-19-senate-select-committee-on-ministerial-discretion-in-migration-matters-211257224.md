  MEDIA RELEASE 

  

  The Senate Select Committee inquiring into ministerial discretion in migration matters met in 

  private for the second time in Canberra today (19 August).  

  

  The Committee published 22 submissions from a range of organisations and individuals with 

  expertise in immigration law and related matters.  These include submissions from the Department 

  of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA), the Migration Review Tribunal 

  and Refugee Review Tribunal and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.  Other 

  submissions are from interested non-government organisations and legal practitioners.   

  

  The Committee’s first public hearing on 5 September 2003 in Canberra will provide an opportunity 

  to hear from DIMIA representatives.  Public hearings will also be held in Sydney on 22 and 23 

  September 2003, with further dates likely. 

  

  The Committee comprises ALP Senators Joe Ludwig, Nick Sherry and Penny Wong, Government 

  Senators Santo Santoro, David Johnston and Gary Humphries and Australian Democrat Senator 

  Andrew Bartlett.  The inquiry’s terms of reference direct the Committee to examine the use and 

  appropriateness of ministerial discretionary powers under the Migration Act 1958. 

  

  Further information about the inquiry and copies of submissions are available on the Committee’s 

  website: www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/minmig_ctte/index.htm or from the Committee 

  Secretariat on 02 6277 3103.
