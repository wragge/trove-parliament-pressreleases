 Bakhtiyari Family Relocated to Port Augusta Residential Housing  Project

 VPS 147/2004

 Minister for Immigration, Amanda Vanstone, announced today that Mrs Bakhtiyari and her six children had been relocated to the Port Augusta  Residential Housing Project.

 The family had been living in alternative detention arrangements in Adelaide.

 ‘The current arrangements became untenable for both the Australian and South Australian Governments,’ the Minister said.

 ‘This occurred well before this week’s High Court decision against one of the Bakhtiyari children.

 ‘Unfortunately, the arrangements could not continue and a decision was made to relocate the family to the housing project where they can be closer  to their father, Ali.

 ‘The family has cost taxpayers in excess of half a million dollars through court action, with the department having to defend more than 20 separate  applications lodged by the family.

 ‘Australians believe in a fair go and this family has certainly been given that. Many Australian kids living on outer edges of capital cities,  Indigenous kids living in remote areas and kids who come from refugee camps in Africa would like to live in Adelaide’s inner eastern suburbs and  go to private schools.

 ‘The Bakhtiyari’s are not refugees. They are Pakistani nationals and can return safely to Pakistan at any time.

 ‘I’m advised that a departmental delegate has considered the latest request from the family for ministerial intervention in their case and determined  that the request contains no new information which would warrant my intervention.

 ‘It is often overlooked that this family can end their immigration detention by agreeing to return to Pakistan. I urge them to do so.’
