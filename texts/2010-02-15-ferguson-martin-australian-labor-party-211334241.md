 Recently arrived South Australians get a sporting chance 

 The City of Salisbury will receive $46 000 in funding under the Australian  Government’s Diverse Australia Program, the Parliamentary Secretary for  Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services, Laurie Ferguson, announced today. 

 ‘The Diverse Australia Program aims to promote respect, fairness and a sense of  belonging for everyone in all Australian communities,’ Mr Ferguson said. 

 The City has recently become home to migrants from countries including  Afghanistan, Myanmar, Iraq, Bhutan and a number of African countries. 

 ‘The Salisbury link: coming together through sport project will encourage newly  arrived families to join in recreational and sporting activities, provide assistance to  parents and run sporting clinics.’ 

 Mr Champion said the project would bring migrants, refugees and the local  community together through sport, helping to build both relationships and team spirit. 

 ‘It is essential that all residents, regardless of their background, feel they provide an  essential and welcome contribution to the Salisbury community. 

 ‘Sport provides a great way for all community members to connect and form lasting  relationships,’ Mr Champion said. 

 Full details of the successful Diverse Australia Program community grants projects  can be found on the Diverse Australia Program website.  See: www.harmony.gov.au
