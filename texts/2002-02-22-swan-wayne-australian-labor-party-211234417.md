 Howard buying time in photos cover-up

 John Howard has deliberately defied the House for a week to avoid releasing damaging information about who received the photographs from the children overboard affair for another fourteen days.

 Following damaging revelations this week that Peter Reith's office selectively released photographs of asylum seekers in the water to back their false claims children had been thrown overboard, Labor has sought full details of who received 13 photos sent by Defence to Ministers' offices.

 On Monday of this week, the Opposition Leader asked Mr Howard:

 Mr CREAN (2.13 p.m.) -My question is to the Prime Minister. It refers to the answer just given by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, representing the Minister for Defence. Prime Minister, given the confused and conflicting stories emerging hourly from your ministers relating to the `children overboard' photographs, will you now undertake to release the filenames and captions of the 13 photos mentioned by the Minister for Defence this morning and the names of all ministers and their staff who received them?

 Mr HOWARD -That is a question that is appropriate for me to take on notice and discuss with the Minister for Defence.

 Despite the Opposition asking another five questions this week on this issue -- two of them to the Speaker, Mr Howard deliberately avoided providing this information to the House before it rose yesterday.  This has bought him another two weeks to attempt to avoid public scrutiny on this issue.

 John Howard pretends the information takes time to get from Defence yet it is contained in a single e-mail.

 Labor will continue to pursue John Howard over the photos cover-up, but it serves to highlight Mr Howard's regular abuse of Question Time by promising to come back to the House with information requested in Questions without Notice -- with the usual tiresome homily about not accepting material quoted by the Opposition -- and then failing to do so.

 Labor will be seeking the cooperation of the Speaker to stamp out this practice.
