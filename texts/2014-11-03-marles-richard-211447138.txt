 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO    

 MEDIA RELEASE    

 SCOTT MORRISON HAS QUESTIONS TO ANSWER    

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Richard Marles has said  serious claims raised by asylum seekers about their treatment at the Manus Island  Regional Processing Centre need to be addressed by the Abbott Government.    

 The allegations that have been reported today by the ABC are deeply concerning  and relate to the events of 16-18 February, which saw the death of Mr Reza Berati.    

 It is not good enough for Scott Morrison to simply discount the claims. A statement  released today by his office states: ‘The Minister is advised a full investigation was  undertaken by Transfield.’    

 This begs the question of whether the Minister has even bothered to ask for a copy  of the investigation.    

 If Scott Morrison can’t be bothered to read the investigation, the very least he can  do is make it available to the Australian people.     

 We need to be assured that asylum seekers are being treated in a dignified, humane  manner and that they are housed in a safe environment.
