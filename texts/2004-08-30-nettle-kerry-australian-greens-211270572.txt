 Senator Kerry Nettle 

 Senator for New South Wales 

 

 Greens call on schools and workplaces to  remind workers and students to enrol to vote   

 Senator Kerry Nettle, 30th August 2004 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today called on all universities, TAFEs, schools and  workplaces to remind their students and staff to enrol to vote in the next week. 

 "Our right to vote is a core pillar of our democracy. Employers, principals, and  university administrators can help by ensuring their staff and students know that they  have just one week to get on the electoral roll. 

 "Many first time voters will not know that they have just one week to get on the  electoral roll. Employers can provide a civic service by notifying staff and allowing  time for them to enrol. 

 "It only takes a couple of minutes to enrol; check your details online and fax in a form  printed off the AEC website. 

 "The views of younger people are under-represented in Australian elections with over  40% of eighteen year olds not on the electoral roll. 

 "Young people are concerned about the war, refugees and Tasmanian forests. They  don't care for the boring men in suits that Howard and Latham represent but they do  want to vote for these issues.
