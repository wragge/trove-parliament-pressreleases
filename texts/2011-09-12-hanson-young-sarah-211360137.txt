 Media Release   

 Australian Greens' Immigration Spokesperson - Senator Sarah Hanson-Young   

 12 September 2011 

 GREENS WILL FIGHT GOVT'S MOVE TO CONTINUE OFFSHORE PROCESSING   

 The Australian Greens will not support this attempt by the Government to circumvent  Australia's obligations under the Refugee Convention and the landmark High Court  ruling.   

 "The announcement made today by the Prime Minister, and Immigration Minister  Chris Bowen, is a breach of our responsibilities under the Refugee Convention, and  the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and is the wrong solution for Australia,"  Greens' Immigration Spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said today.   

 "This move comes as another poll is released on asylum seekers, showing that the  majority of Australians (54%) support onshore processing, with only 25% in favour of  the major parties offshore processing solution.   

 "It is a sad day, when the Australian Labor Party has announced a policy, reminiscent  of John Howard's Pacific Solution quick fix that was introduced into Parliament 10  years ago this week.  The Prime Minister’s proposed amendments to the law will give  even less human rights protections to vulnerable people than the legislation  introduced by the Howard Government in 2001.   

 "What we need is a commonsense, cost-effective and humane Australian solution  that allows us to get on with the job that we signed up to do.  That is, processing the  claims of vulnerable asylum seekers who come to this country seeking our  protection.   

 The Greens also remain concerned by the Government's response to the Minister for  Immigration's role as the guardian of unaccompanied minors.   

 "What the Greens and the majority of Australians want to know is, who will look after  these children and ensure their rights and welfare are protected.  The Government  made it clear today, that it won't be them.
