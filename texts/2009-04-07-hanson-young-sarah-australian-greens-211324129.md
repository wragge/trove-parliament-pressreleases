 Christmas Island an expensive white elephant   

 Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young says a boatload of suspected asylum seekers  should not be taken to Christmas Island, and instead should be brought to mainland  Australia to undergo checks and have any claims processed.   

 A boat carrying 63 people was intercepted 58 kilometres off Ashmore Reef, north of  the Australian coast, and is currently being transported to detention facilities on  Christmas Island.   

 “The carrying out of checks and processing of any claims of these people would be  much better managed on the Australian mainland,” said Senator Hanson-Young.   

 “Claim processing and checks could be done on the mainland more humanely, with  better public scrutiny, and more efficiently and without the exorbitant cost involved  with Christmas Island.   

 “According to the Immigration Department, it costs $70,000 each time departmental  officials are flown to Christmas Island to assist with those checks.   

 “Particularly at a time when the Government are looking to ‘cut some fat’ from its  spending, Christmas Island is proving to be an expensive white elephant.”   

 Senator Hanson-Young said the detention facilities on Christmas Island should be  closed, as suggested in last week’s United Nations Human Rights Report on  Australia, which assessed Australia’s compliance with the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights.   

 “Last week’s report card by the United Nations’ Human Rights Committee specified  its concern over the fact that people who arrive in Australian waters by boat are  taken to Christmas Island,” she said.   

 “The Rudd Government’s promises of a more compassionate, humane approach to  immigration begin to ring hollow when asylum seekers are taken to a remote island  2300 kilometres from the mainland.   

 “Of course, those who come to Australia seeking our protection and assistance must  have their claims processed and health and identity checks carried out, but the best  place for that to happen is mainland Australia.   

 “The Greens call on the Federal Government to urgently take up the United Nations’  suggestion, and close the detention facilities at Christmas Island.”
