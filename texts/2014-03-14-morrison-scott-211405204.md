 Minister for Immigration and Border Protection 

 Scott Morrison 

 85 days since last successful people smuggling venture 

 Friday, 14 March 2014 

 The latest weekly update for Operation Sovereign Borders reveals 85 days have now  passed since the last successful people smuggling venture to Australia, Minister for  Immigration and Border Protection, the Hon Scott Morrison said today. 

 85 days, or more than 12 weeks, since the last successful people smuggling venture  to Australia demonstrates the continued success of Operation Sovereign Borders,  particularly maritime operations, in stopping the boats. 

 The last people smuggling venture that made it to Australia and had all passengers  handed over to Australian immigration authorities was on December 19 last year. 

 From 20 December 2012 to 14 March 2013 there were 40 illegal boat arrivals with a  total of 2121 people on board. 

 The personnel carrying out the government's policies under Operation Sovereign  Borders, including the serving men and women of our armed forces and Australian  Customs and Border Protection Service, our diplomats, police, immigration officers  and other officials, are making remarkable progress. 

 However there will be no let-up under Operation Sovereign Borders. As the monsoon  period ends it is imperative that tension remains in the cord on border protection.  The message is clear - the policy of the government to intercept and safely remove  boats that seek to illegally enter Australia remains. 

 Meanwhile the reduction in the detainee population on Christmas Island continues,  lessening pressure on facilities. When Operation Sovereign Borders commenced  there were over 2600 people accommodated on the island, now there are 1700.
