  National Identity database could threaten  privacy standards

  Locking up 'clients' indefinitely  is the problem cabinet should consider 

  Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today said the recommendations from the Palmer  report were unlikely to prevent future human tragedies being played out in  detention centres whilst the policy of indefinite mandatory detention remained  in place. She also raised concerns that a national database threatened privacy  protections. 

  "The cabinet should be considering a return to the more humane asylum seeker  processing that ran successfully in Australia for decades if they truly want to  address community concerns about asylum seekers," Senator Nettle said. 

  "National Identity databases are not going to prevent the vast majority of  tragedies that the current system generates because these tragedies are not  about identity they are about indefinite detention. 

  "The proposals also threaten the privacy of all Australian's. The linking of  various government databases will erode the foundations on which privacy  protection in Australia is built. Privacy should not be traded off for an illusory  promise of addressing immigration bungles. 

  "Mick Palmer was not asked to question the policy of mandatory detention, and  as a result this core policy is not affected by his recommendations. 

  "The problems besetting the department of immigration are largely politically  driven policy problems which will not be fixed by administrative tinkering. 

  "The Greens urge the government to recognise the need to scrap the mandatory  detention policy and return Australia to a more human and compassionate  approach to dealing with asylum seekers."
