 SUCCESS FOR BABI IN BID TO BUILD COMMUNITY HARMONY 

 Friday, 7 October 2005 

 Federal Member for Bonner, Ross Vasta, today congratulated Bayside Adolescent  Boarding Inc (BABI) on their success in being awarded funding of $10,000 for their  ‘Welcoming the Stranger’ project.    

 “Projects like ‘Welcoming the Stranger’ are great examples of local solutions to local  issues. They get people working together to do the important work of breaking down  barriers and building community harmony,” said Mr Vasta.    

 In recent times many large African refugee families have entered the rental market in  Wynnum/Manly and they have faced difficulties securing private rental  accommodation.    

 “BABI’s ‘Welcoming the Stranger’ project will seek to overcome this by providing  information and cross cultural training to local real estate agents. It will also hold  informal social events to bring agents and refugees together to share perspectives and  develop relationships,” Mr Vasta explained.    

 “The funding of this project is great news for the local area and is an element of the  Government’s Living in Harmony initiative, which aims to address issues of racism in  Australia.    

 The Australian Government allocated $14 million to the Living in Harmony initiative  over four years from 2002-03. ‘Welcoming the Stranger’ is one of 39 projects around  Australia to be awarded funding.    

 “BABI should be extremely proud of their achievement and I wish them all the very  best with this latest project” Mr Vasta said.
