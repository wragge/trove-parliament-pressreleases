 FROM THE AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR HEALTH  THE HON. NEAL BLEWETT

 Commonwealth Grant to Victorian Health Researcher

 The effectiveness of an antismoking campaign  in Victoria is to be assessed following approval of a  $15 284 Federal Government grant to review the Latrobe  Valley Community Smoking Control Project, which had been 

 designed to reduce over five years the incidence of smoking  among adolescents in the Latrobe Valley.

 The Minister for Health, Dr Neal Blewett, today  announced that the study would be conducted by Dr Christopher  Fraser of the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education,  Churchill, Victoria.

 Dr Blewett said the study would measure changes  in school age population smoking rates over a four year  period. The study would also contribute to an understanding  of the effectiveness of community based rather than government  centered programs to reduce smoking, particularly at a time  of rapidily rising costs of health services.

 The grant to Dr Fraser was one of a number of  grants totalling $162 670 made to health researchers in  Australia under the Health Services Research and Development  Grant Scheme, a Scheme administered by the Commonwealth  Department of Health.
