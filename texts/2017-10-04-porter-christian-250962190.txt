  Joint Media Release 

  Wednesday, 4th  October 2017 

  Ministers mark completion of resettlement of 12,000 Syrian and Iraqi 

  refugees 

  A special event in Melbourne today will mark the completion of the settlement of 12,000 Syrian and  Iraqi refugees. 

  Minister for Social Services, Christian Porter, and Assistant Minister for Social Services and  Multicultural Affairs, Zed Seselja, will join refugee families in Melbourne to mark the milestone. 

  It is just over two years since the Government announced that Australia would welcome 12,000  displaced Syrians and Iraqis fleeing conflict in the Middle East. 

  All families have now arrived in Australia after the final visas under the special intake were granted in  March this year. 

  Minister Porter said this additional intake was another part of Australia's long and proud tradition of  resettling refugees and vulnerable people in humanitarian need. 

  "Our commitment to resettle an additional 12,000 Syrian and Iraqi refugees, on top of the total  Humanitarian Program intake of 13,750, is testament to Australia's commitment to help those in  need," Minister Porter said. 

  "Australia is a compassionate and welcoming nation to refugees, with more than 865,000 people  arriving under our Humanitarian Program since 1945. 

  "Our focus here has been on those most in need, particularly women, children and families of  persecuted minorities who have sought refuge from the conflicts in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey." 

  Australia's Humanitarian Program has an increased intake of 16,250 places for the 2017-18 financial  year and 18,750 in 2018-19. 

  Assistant Minister Seselja said Syrians and Iraqis from this additional intake have settled in all states  and territories and in regional and metropolitan areas.

  "In recent months I have had the privilege of meeting and talking with new refugee arrivals around the  country - in Hobart, Canberra, Melbourne, Toowoomba and Logan - as well as staff and volunteers  from settlement service providers," Assistant Minister Seselja said. 

  "These refugees have very moving stories. 

  "Many of the refugees who come here are seeking protection from conflict and trauma unimaginable  to most of us here. 

  "But what was also clear to me during these meetings how well Australians help settle people into  their new lives - and how we have been doing this for decades. We have some of the best settlement  services in the world and we should be proud of it. 

  "We are committed to ensuring humanitarian entrants are able to overcome barriers, start a new life  and integrate into Australian society as quickly as possible."
