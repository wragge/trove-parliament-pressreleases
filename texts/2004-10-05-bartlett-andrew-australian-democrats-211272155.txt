 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/1007 TUESDAY 5 OCTOBER 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT             AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS LEADER AND SPOKESPERSON ON IMMIGRATION  DEMOCRATS HAVE STRONGEST RECORD ON REFUGEE ISSUES The Australian Democrats have welcomed the efforts of A Just Australia to raise the refugee issue in the election campaign through advertising and surveying candidates. "The Democrats are pleased the results recognise the Democrats as having the strongest record on refugee issues," Senator Andrew Bartlett Leader of the Democrats said. "We donâ€™t just talk about the tragedy of Australia's treatment of refugees, we approach the Minister to assist individual cases, and we go to the detention centres to speak to the refugees themselves. "It's outrageous that 3 years ago there was an election where the blowtorch was being put on refugees around the country. Three years later those people are suffering still as a direct consequence of what was done to them three years ago and I have met with the people still locked up on Nauru today. There are thousands of refugees still suffering uncertainty, still being kept separated from their families three years on.  "Neither Labor nor Liberal has seen fit to talk at all about those people who are the victims of what those parties did to them as part of their electioneering 3 years ago. While the Green senators have talked about it, they haven't acted. "We welcome the attempt by A Just Australia to put the focus back on the refugees, on the people who are directly affected," Senator Bartlett concluded. Senator Bartlett is the only member of Parliament to have visited every detention centre and has had the greatest success of any parliamentarian in successfully seeking the Minister's intervention on individual humanitarian cases. He was the first to raise the Tampa issue in Parliament before the last election, and has raised the refugee issue in Parliament on three times as many occasions as Greens Leader Senator Bob Brown. Since they have both been in Parliament, Senator Andrew Bartlett has raised refugee issues 247 times in the unglamorous environments of Senate Committees and Estimates Committees. Senator Brown has never turned up to a Senate Committee or Estimates committee to ask a question about refugees. Despite the record, the Green Party continues to claim to be the strongest on refugee issues. In the A Just Australia survey, candidates ranked according to their responses to a survey on refugee issues and the Democrats scored a high number of 'first' rankings.
