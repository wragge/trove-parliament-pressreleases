 DUNCAN KERR SC MP   

 FEDERAL MEMBER FOR DENISON 

 MEDIA RELEASE  30 June 2005 

 

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUSTICES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS   

 A proposal to deal with the controversial, often vexed, issue of removing federal  judges  who  are  not  performing  their  duties  has  been  presented  to  an   administrative law forum in Canberra today.   

 In a paper to the 2005 Australian Institute of Administrative Law forum titled,  “The  Removal  of  Federal  Justices:  Qui  Custodio  Custodis?”,  former  Justice   Minister,  Duncan  Kerr  S.C.,  proposes  the  establishment  of  a  new  statutory   body to investigate complaints of judicial misconduct. 

 

 “The sorry history surrounding the case of the late High Court Justice, Lionel  Murphy, represented the first and last time Parliament gave detailed attention  to whether or not the removal of a federal Justice may be warranted,” Mr Kerr 

 said.   

 “In the Murphy case, the debate became partisan and poisonous.  Little wonder  the  Parliament  has  been  shy  of  turning  its  attention  to  what  formal  and   consistent  mechanism  might  be  put  in  place  for  dealing  with  allegations  of   judicial misconduct or incapacity.   

 “The large expansion in the federal judiciary increases the likelihood that in the  foreseeable  future,  Parliament  may  be  called  on  to  decide  whether  or  not  to   agree to an address for the removal of a federal Justice.     

 “There is clearly a need for a known, predictable and rule-based system to be  put  in  place,  so  we  are  not  dealing  with  this  issue  on  an  ad-hoc,  possibly   partisan, basis.    

 “The  proposed  Parliamentary  (Judicial  Misbehaviour  or  Incapacity)  Commission  (PJMIC)  would  be  a  transparent,  fair  and  independent  body  vested  with  wide-ranging powers, akin to those of a Royal Commission, to investigate complaints  of misconduct referred to it by a House of the Parliament. 

 

 “The establishment of such a Commission, with statutory powers, would require  an Act of Parliament.  Prior to its formation, there would need to be substantial  public and political debate on what form the Commission might take, and what  powers and responsibilities it is granted by the Parliament. 

 

 “I have spoken to the Attorney General, Philip Ruddock, and to my colleagues  within  the  ALP  about  the  need  for  an  improved,  cooperative  approach  to  the   issue of judicial misconduct or incapacity.      

 “It is my hope that we can work together as parliamentarians with an interest in  the  law,  to  find  some  resolution  to  this  issue  before  controversy  again  arises   over the performance of a Justice in the federal jurisdiction.  My paper is one  contribution to the debate,” Mr Kerr said.

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUSTICES:  QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS?   

 1.  THE  HISTORY  

 

 1.1 The growth of the federal judiciary   

 Before  the  creation  of  the  Federal  Court  and  the  Family  Court  of   Australia  in  the  1970s  no  more  than  seven  federal  judges  served  the   nation  at  any  one  time.  Those  were  the  justices  appointed  to  exercise  

 the  judicial  power  of  the  Commonwealth  of  Australia  that  the   Constitution vests in the High Court1.    

 Now,  combined,  the  Federal  and  Family  Courts  are  constituted  by   almost  a  hundred  judges.  When  the  members  of  the  recently  created   Federal Magistrates Court are included, the number of federal justices  jumps to over 1302.   

 There  is  no  constitutional  limit  on  the  number  of  federal  judges  and   magistrates  the  Government  can  appoint,  nor  upon  the  number  of   federal  courts  that  the  Commonwealth  parliament  can  create3.  In  the   past  quarter  century  Australia  has  evolved  a  separate  and  distinct   hierarchy of federal courts.    

 The  most  recent  federal  expansion  was  in  1999.  It  followed  the   Commonwealth’s decision to establish a Federal Magistrate’s Court to  ease the growing burden of the existing federal courts, and on the State  and  Territory  courts  invested  with  federal  jurisdiction4.  According  to   High  Court  Chief  Justice  Murray  Gleeson  the  Federal  Magistrate’s   Court is likely to become “one of Australia’s largest courts”5.   

 1.2 The “visibility” issue   

 The  growth  in  the  number  of  federal  justices  has  coincided  with   increasing scrutiny of, and growing public interest in, the role of those  judges. The federal judiciary is now in the cut and thrust of everyday  life  for  Australians;  everything  from  their  family  relationships  to  the   conduct  of  trade  and  commerce;  from  copyright  to  migration,  and  a   plethora of other matters governed by federal law. 

 

 1  See the Constitution, section 71 (which requires there to be at least two High Court judges) and the  High Court of Australia Act 1979, section 5 (which limits the number of High Court judges to seven).  2

  See Table 1. For a history of the growth of the federal judiciary see Chief Justice Murray Gleeson, “A  Changing Judiciary”, Judicial Conference of Australia, Uluru, 7 April 2001.  3  The Constitution, section 71 provides: “The judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a  Federal Supreme Court, to be called the High Court of Australia, and in such other federal courts as the  Parliament creates”.  4

  For the purposes of the Constitution Federal Magistrates are “Justices” appointed under section 72.  See New South Wales v Commonwealth (1915) 20 CLR 54.  5

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 2

 

 Federal  courts  have  been  the  testing  ground  for  some  of  the  most   contentious  government  policy  and  law-making  of  our  times.  The   decisions of the High Court of Australia in Mabo6 and Wik7 generated  media  and  policy  near-hysteria.  In  more  recent  times,  immigration   cases  involving  decisions  of  the  Family,  Federal  and  High  Courts   regarding  the  right  of  entry  and  permanent  residence  in  Australia  of   refugees have attracted similar attention.   

 In recent years debate over the scope of what is the legitimate role of  the  judiciary  has  overlapped  controversies  about  the  conduct  of   individual judges.   

 Putting  to  one  side  the  widespread  criticism  of  former  Chief  Justice   Barwick  for  role  he  played  and  the  advice  he  gave  in  the  1975   dismissal  of  the  Whitlam  government,  the  only  High  Court  justice  to   have been subjected to prolonged attention for alleged misconduct has  been Justice Lionel Murphy9.   

 Justice Murphy’s alleged misconduct became the subject of extensive  parliamentary  scrutiny  but  he  died  before  that  process  could  be   concluded.  Prior  to  his  death,  His  Honour  had  been  acquitted  of   criminal charges over related allegations10.   

 Instances of serious allegations going to the capacity or misconduct of  state  judges  were  also  rare  between  1901  and  recent  times.  The  only   state  superior  court  judge  to  have  been  removed  from  office  since   federation  was  Queensland  Supreme  Court  Judge  Angelo  Vasta  in   1989.   

 I am aware of only one other instance, between federation and the turn  of  the  century,  when  removal  of  a  state  judge  was  seriously   contemplated.

  There is of course the sad case of Justice Piddington who, before his appointment to the bench in  1913, had assured the government of the day of his soundness on Commonwealth powers. The uproar  that ensued when that assurance became public caused Piddington to decide not to take up his office.  10

  Over the period late 1983 to early 1984 two newspapers published alleged transcripts of telephone  calls, intercepted and taped by NSW Police, between persons known to be associated with organised  crime in NSW, a Sydney solicitor and "a senior judge". The senior judge was alleged to be Justice  Murphy. Charges of perverting the course of justice were laid against His Honour on the basis of  material contained in the alleged transcripts.

 In  1997  NSW  Supreme  Court  Judge  Vince  Bruce’s  fitness  to  hold   judicial  office  was  debated  by  the  NSW  parliament.  Complaints   against  him  of  extensive  and  repeated  delays  of  up  to  three  years  in   handing  down  his  decisions  were  upheld  by  the  NSW  Judicial   Commission.  However  despite  those  findings,  after  hearing   representations  on  His  Honour’s  behalf,  the  New  South  Wales’   Legislative Council decided not to take the ultimate step of voting for  his removal11.    

 1.3  Increased  scrutiny    

 Since  2000  there  seems  to  have  been  an  upsurge  in  public  

 controversies  involving  judicial  conduct  or  fitness  to  hold  office.  In   this, less than five years, there have been at least ten instances in which  state  and  federal  judges  or  prominent  magistrates  have  become  the   subject of allegations or controversies in respect of matters that, at least  potentially, raised issues of their fitness to remain on the bench.    

 â¢ In  2000,  then  Victorian  Chief  Magistrate  Michael  Adams   received  a  vote  of  no-confidence  from  his  fellow  magistrates   and resigned. Had he not done so media reports suggest that the  question  of  his  removal  may  have  been  considered  by  the   Victorian Government12.   

 â¢ In 2001, two Victorian County Court judges were convicted of  failing  to  lodge  tax  returns.  One  resigned,  after  the  Victorian   Government took advice on removal; the other remained on the  bench13.   

 â¢ In  2002,  the  then  Queensland  Chief  Magistrate,  Di  Fingleton   was accused of retaliating against a witness--fellow magistrate  Basil  Gribbin--in  judicial  proceedings.  She  stood  trial  on  that   charge and in June 2002 was convicted and sentenced to a term  of  imprisonment.  After  serving  six  months  in  prison,  and   having  resigned  her  position,  Ms  Fingleton  was  ultimately   exonerated by the High Court this month when her appeal was  upheld. The High Court held that Ms Fingleton should not have  been charged given an immunity from prosecution contained in  section 21A of the Queensland Magistrate's Act for conduct of  a judicial officer acting in an official administrative capacity15.   

 â¢ In  the  same  year,  Senator  Heffernan,  then  Parliamentary   Secretary to the Cabinet, made extraordinary allegations in the

 Senate  that  High  Court  Justice  Michael  Kirby  had  misused   Commonwealth  cars  to  pick  up  rent  boys  in  Sydney16.  Rather   than  distancing  himself  from  these  allegations,  the  Prime   Minister  appeared  to  endorse  them  saying  "any  suggestion   [Senator  Heffernan]  used  parliamentary  privilege  as  a  first   resort,  rather  than  a  last  resort,  is  wrong"17.  Justice  Kirby   immediately,  and  forcefully,  denied  Senator  Heffernan’s   allegations  but  these  stories,  not  surprisingly,  remained  front   page  news  until  subsequent  investigations  established  that  the   supposed  Commonwealth  car  records  upon  which  Senator   Heffernan  had  built  his  case  against  the  judge  were  forgeries.   Senator  Heffernan  resigned  his  position  as  Parliamentary   Secretary   

 â¢ In  2004,  NSW  Magistrate  Pat  O’Shane  had  an  AVO  order   issued against her on the application of her estranged husband.  She took leave from the bench21.   

 â¢ In  the  same  year,  NSW  Supreme  Court  Judge  Jeff  Shaw  was   charged  with  drink-driving.  As  a  result  of  those  charges,  and   the  associated  publicity  about  the  alleged  circumstances   surrounding  them,  the  judge’s  fitness  for  office  became  a   matter of controversy and he chose to submit his resignation22.    

 â¢ In  early  2005,  several  unnamed  NSW  judges  and  magistrates   were issued with notices by the Australian Taxation Office for  allegedly  failing  to  lodge  tax  returns  for  periods  of  up  to  7   years23.  What,  if  any,  action  may  be  taken  in  respect  of  these   allegations is yet unknown.   

 â¢ At  about  the  same  time  NSW  District  Court  Judge  Ian  Dodd   had  a  “minor”  but  very  public  and  embarrassing  complaint   upheld by the NSW Judicial Commission.

 The  criticism  was  that  he  had  repeatedly  fallen  asleep  on  the   bench24. It was reported that His Honour had been treated for a  medical condition and was fit to continue his duties. That may  not  be  the  end  of  the  matter.  The  New  South  Wales  Premier,   Bob  Carr,  recently  gave  his  opinion  that  Judge  Dodd’s   performance  had  "been  below  par"  and  confirmed  that  the   judge  remained  the  subject  of  investigation  by  the  conduct   division of the Judicial Commission25.   

 â¢ In a third matter around the same time, Justice Michael Hannon  of the Family Court of Australia became the subject of national  and  local  headlines  for  alleged  delays  stretching  over  years  in   his  handing  down  judgements  in  contested  family  law   matters28.  Justice  Hannon  had  given  notice  of  his  intention  to   retire from the bench before those allegations became public29.    

 â¢ More  recently,  Western  Australian  Chief  Justice  David   Malcolm took leave of the bench after he had made a number  of serious errors in directions to a jury in a major criminal trial.  The trial was aborted. A spokeswoman for the Chief Justice has  denied that his departure on leave was connected to the aborted  trial.  Although  there  have  been  relatively  sympathetic   responses  to  the  His  Honour’s  circumstances,  the  West   Australian Opposition spokesman on legal affairs drew on these  circumstances  to  call  for  Western  Australia  to  follow  New   South Wales and set up a Judicial Commission with the powers  to investigate allegations of judicial misconduct or incapacity30.

  Some media reports referred to correspondence between me and the Family Court in relation to  aspects of these allegations.  His Honour’s retirement removed any rationale for possible parliamentary  consideration of whether the delays alleged, in the circumstances they were alleged to have occurred,  could have amounted to incapacity to hold judicial office. In the absence of a full opportunity to hear  His Honour’s side of the story it is unfair to infer that they would have.  30

 1.4 Dealing with criticism   

 How  we,  as  a  community,  deal  with  allegations,  criticisms  or   complaints  about  judges’  conduct  has  become  a  key  issue  for   government and the judiciary alike.  In an era when the media shows  very little deference to the judiciary, such concerns cannot, if they ever  formerly could, be ignored.    

 But there is a countervailing interest we should also consider when we  debate ‘accountability’. The accountability of  individual  judges  ought   be insisted upon within a framework of respect for the judiciary and for  the  important  constitutional  role  courts  play.  This  framework  is  too   rarely given sufficient weight. Casual resort to intemperate criticism of  the judiciary or individual judges is likely to exact a high price. Loss of  respect for the judiciary will diminish the community’s regard for, and,  eventually, weaken our instinctive defence of the rule of law.   

 Justice  Michael  Kirby,  speaking  a  decade  before  the  reckless  and   wholly  wrongful  attack  made  on  his  own  character  by  Senator   Heffernan,  presciently  spoke  out  against  the  “atmosphere  of   disrespect” that he feared would come to prevail31.    

 On  the  retirement  of  prominent  New  South  Wales’  Court  of  Appeal   Justice R M Hope, Justice Kirby commented:   

 Challenges  to,  indeed  attacks  upon,  the  integrity,  and  at   times  the  independence,  of  judges  have  increased   significantly  in  the  last  ten  years.  Judges  and  the  judicial   system  are,  and  indeed  must  be,  sufficiently  robust  to  be   subjected  to  informed  criticism.  But  the  attrition  of   continual uninformed and unjustified criticism is not merely  an irritant; it could, if not kept in check, cause great, even  irreparable harm to the system itself.32 

 

 31  Justice Michael Kirby, “Judicial Independence in Australia reaches a moment of truth”, UNSWLJ  (1990) vol 13 (2) pp. 187-211 at 192.  32

  Ibid at p.188. Justice Kirby’s speech was made in 1990 - a time when it was still expected that the  responsibility of replying to malicious or ill-informed criticism of a federal judge or the judiciary  ordinarily fell to the Commonwealth Attorney-General. Whilst that convention was always an  imperfect shield against uninformed and unjustified criticism of judges and the judiciary, its importance  should not be underestimated. The decision of former Attorney-General Daryl Williams QC, reaffirmed  by his successor, the current Attorney-General Phillip Ruddock, that under the current government the  Commonwealth’s first law officer would no longer respect that constitutional convention has greatly  exacerbated the problems that Justice Kirby identified. Sadly, if ironically, even the salacious and  unfounded criticisms of Justice Kirby by Senator Heffernan, failed to prompt the Attorney-General to  reconsider. 

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 7

 

 This danger justifies a warning that great restraint should be exercised  to  avoid  irresponsible  and  unfounded  attacks.  There  is  a  further   practical  consideration  that,  in  fairness,  should  be  taken  into  account.   Often there is no-one who can readily come to their defence.   

 Most judges who are confronted with criticism are constrained by their  office,  or  believe  themselves  to  be,  from  speaking  out  in  their  own   interest. Because of that constraint, the role of defending the judiciary  from  unjustifiable  attacks  used  to  be  undertaken  by  Commonwealth   and  State  Attorneys  General.  However  in  recent  times,  at  the  federal   level,  this  responsibility  has  been  renounced  by  both  the  current  and  

 the immediate-past first law officers of the Commonwealth33. This has  left a vacuum.    

 2.  PARLIAMENT’S  POWERS    

 2.1 The Constitutional context   

 The  question  of  whether  it  is  possible  to  devise  a  comprehensive   system  that  adequately  balances  these  concerns  -  one  that  would  be   robust in hearing complaints about the conduct of the federal judiciary,  yet also weed out unfounded attacks and ensure there are proper means  for the judiciary to address misconceived criticism - is a complex and  difficult question. Some consideration to the question has been given in  recent Commonwealth and State reviews34.   

 However,  without  an  amendment  to  the  Constitution35  it  is  doubtful   that Federal parliament has the capacity to legislate for any complaints  mechanism to  adjudicate  on  alleged  judicial  misconduct  other  than  in   the context of Chapter III and more particularly of section72(ii) of the  Constitution.  That  subsection  provides,  inter  alia,  that  the  Justices  of   the High Court and other federal courts:  

 

 …shall  not  be  removed  except  by  the  Governor  General  in   Council, on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in  the  same  session,  praying  for  such  removal  on  the  ground  of   proved misbehaviour or incapacity. 

 

 33  See note 32, supra.  34  See Australian Law Reform Commission Report No. 89: Managing Justice: A Review of the Federal  Civil Justice System (2000); Attorney-General’s Department, Government Response to ALRC Report  No. 89 at http://www.ag.gov.au/alrc89 updated 6 June 2004; Commonwealth Attorney-General’s  Strategy Paper, Federal Civil Justice System (December 2003); Australian Institute of Judicial  Administration, The Governance of Australia’s Courts: A Managerial Perspective (2004); Professor  Peter Sallmann, The Judicial Conduct and Complaints System in Victoria (2003).  35

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 8

 

 This  provision,  and  the  additional  guarantee  that,  having  been   appointed,  a  federal  justice’s  term  of  office  continues  until  the   prescribed  retirement  age,  reflects  the  intention  of  the  framers  of  the   Constitution  to  strengthen  the  guarantee  of  judicial  independence   beyond that which was entrenched in British constitutional practice and  law at the time of federation36 by the Act of Settlement37.   

 Writing  shortly  after  federation,  Quick  and  Garran  noted  that  these   provisions did not allow for the suspension of a justice:   

 It would seem that suspension is a temporary removal, and that  as  the  Governor  General  in  Council  has  no  power  of  his  own   motion to remove, he has no power to suspend.  Certainly such  a  power  would  be  open  to  dangerous  abuse,  and  might   endanger  the  independence  of  the  Bench  as  a  constitutional   bulwark against Parliamentary encroachment38.   

 Whilst  there  is  no  binding  authority  to  confirm  Quick  and  Garran’s   view,  no  Commonwealth  government  has  since  contested  that   conclusion. It is undoubtedly correct.   

 However,  Quick  and  Garran’s  reasoning  in  this  regard  is  capable  of   supporting,  and  perhaps  even  requiring,  a  broader  conclusion.   It  is   strongly  arguable  that  an  identical  danger  of  abuse  and  risk  to  the   independence  of  the  bench  must  be  inherent  in  any  measure  that   purportedly  authorises  the  Executive  or  Legislature,  or  any  entity   established by either of those branches of government, to admonish or  censure  a  justice  over  the  discharge  of  his  or  her  judicial  functions,   except as provided for by section 72.    

 It is not impossible, and may indeed be likely, given the history of the  High Court’s decisions regarding the separation of powers and judicial  independence conferred by Chapter III of the Constitution, that such an  argument might prevail if the proposition was ever tested.   

 For  this  reason,  notwithstanding  the  merits  of  the  New  South  Wales   Judicial Commission model39, there must at least be some appreciable  doubt  that  it  is  open  to  the  federal  parliament  to  impose  

 ‘accountability’  on  federal  justices  in  a  way  analogous  to  New  South   Wales.

 In  view  of  this,  it  would  seem wise  for the federal parliament first to  address how the existing and certain powers under section 72 can best  be  exercised  before  assaying  further  proposals  of  uncertain   constitutional validity. Accordingly, the focus of this paper will be to  examine the procedures and processes that could be put in place to deal  with cases of alleged misconduct or incapacity which may arise under  section 72 of the Constitution.   

 While the focus is narrow, it is nonetheless timely. The large expansion  of the federal judiciary increases the likelihood that, in the foreseeable  future, parliament may be called on to decide whether or not to agree  to an address for the removal of a federal justice.   

 2.2 The Murphy case   

 No  justice  has  been  removed  under  provisions  of  section  72  of  the   Constitution.  The only time parliament has given detailed attention to  whether or not the removal of a justice might be warranted40 was when  the  alleged  misconduct  of  former  High  Court  Justice  Murphy  came   before it.   

 An excellent summary of the history of the parliamentary response to  the  Murphy  controversy  can  be  found  in  Odgers’  Australian  Senate   Practice ("Odgers")41.    

 This paper draws on that account not only for its good summary of the  history  but  also  for  the  suggestions  made  by  Odgers  regarding  the   lessons that ought to be learnt from the Murphy experience. However,  Odgers  does  not  comment  upon  what,  in  my  opinion,  is  the  central   lesson that ought to be learnt from that experience.    

 The  Murphy  case  should  teach  us  that  any  ad  hoc  procedure  put  in   place  after  a  specific  allegation  of  judicial  misconduct  or  incapacity   has been brought to light can, and almost certainly will, be criticised as  lacking at least some of the institutional attributes appropriate for a fair  hearing and respect for the rule of law.    

 Unless  a  known  and  predictable  rule-based  system  is  put  in  place   before  any  individual  justice’s  conduct  is  brought  before  the   parliament,  it  will  be  easy  to  call  into  question  the  fairness  of  any   procedure subsequently introduced.    

 If  that  proposition  appears  self-evident,  it  may  be  wondered  why   nothing has been done to agree some rules.   

 

 40  The only other instance of the conduct of a justice being formally raised was by way of an  unsuccessful motion in the Senate in 1980 to establish a joint select committee to examine allegedly  improper business interests of the then Chief Justice of the High Court.  41

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 10

 The reason the federal parliament has not sorted this out has its source  in  the  highly  charged  and  partisan  debate that surrounded the attempt   to remove Justice Murphy.    

 In  the  poisonous  aftermath  of  those  debates  any  proposal  to  adopt   procedures  to  govern  future  cases  would  have  seemed  naive.   Discussion  would  have  swiftly  degenerated  and  would  have  been   overwhelmed  by  partisan  attacks  on,  or  defences  of  actions  taken  by,  

 the Senate with respect to the late Justice.    

 Sufficient  time  may  now  have  passed  for  a  cooler  debate  to  be   possible.  If  this  is  so,  now  would  be  a  good  time  to  decide  how  we   want to proceed in the future.   

 That  is  for  two  reasons.  First,  the  practical  likelihood  of  the  need  for   such  procedures  has  increased  because,  as  discussed  at  the  outset  of   this  paper,  of  the  ever  expanding  number  of  federal  justices.  Second,  

 these  kinds  of  decisions  are  best  made  when  there  is  no  imminent   controversy  looming.  To  my  knowledge,  there  is  no  proposal  to   remove  a  federal  judge  or  magistrate  currently  under  contemplation.   No ad-hominem  problems  cloud  the  parliamentary  horizon.   It  would   be prudent for parliament to use this window of opportunity to agree a  non-partisan framework to apply to any future proposed removal.   

 2.3 Formal and informal resolution of complaints   

 Allegations of misconduct or unfitness come before parliament - if at  all  -  in  an  ad  hoc  manner.  There  is  no  settled  process.  A  constituent   might raise a complaint with his or her federal Member. A complaint  of  alleged  misbehaviour  or  incapacity  might  come  to  the  attention  of   the  Attorney-General  through  representations  to  his  department  or   directly.    

 Some matters which seem to raise potential triggers for removal, upon  examination,  will  be  discovered  to  have  no  merit.  Others  which  have   merit may be capable of being resolved informally. For example, it is  not,  in  my experience,  considered  improper  for  the Attorney-General,   or  indeed  individual  Members  of  parliament,  to  raise  matters  of   potential concern with the Chief Justice of the relevant court42.    

 Informal mechanisms of this kind will sometimes remove the need for  parliamentary  action.  Where  illness,  stress  or  like  factors  may  have   reduced the capacity of a judge to perform his or her work effectively,  early retirement may be discussed within the court and agreed to by the  judge or magistrate.    

 

 42  If  this  is  not  to  be  misinterpreted,  these  steps  must  avoid  both  the  reality  and  also  any  possible   appearance of seeking to influence the decision-making of a justice in a particular case.  

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 11

 Informal mechanisms are not, however, appropriate means for dealing  with  substantive  allegations  of  misconduct.  If  serious  allegations  (for   example  bribery  or  fraud)  are  involved,  private  discussions  which  go   beyond  factual  enquiries  risk  being  misconstrued  as  demonstrating  a   willingness to ‘cover up’ wrongdoing.    

 Furthermore, complaints to Members and Senators or to the Attorney-General are just one of many ways allegations relevant to the fitness of  a federal justice to hold office can come to the attention of parliament.  The Murphy allegations were given sensational media attention before  parliament  was  involved.  Public  interest  in  judicial  conduct  has   intensified and this often generates extensive media coverage.    

 Informal processes have their limits.   

 2.4 Guaranteeing judicial probity and guarding judicial independence   

 Too ready resort to the ultimate sanction of removing federal justices  must  be  discouraged.   But  too  great  a  nicety  in  approach  by  the   parliament  can  also  be  damaging—and  potentially  more  so.  If   parliament  fails  its  constitutional  responsibility  as  the  ultimate   guardian  of  the  probity  of  judicial  system,  and  does  nothing  when  it   plainly ought, then whilst controversy may be avoided for a time, the  cost  of  leaving  a  justice  on  the  bench  when  the  facts  warrant  their   removal  will,  when  exposed,  result  in  much  greater  loss  of  public   confidence.   

 Modern  constitutional  theory  acknowledges  the  importance  of  party   discipline;  however,  issues  of  the  kind  involved  in  the  removal  of  a   justice  should  be  removed  from  party  consideration  to  the  greatest   degree possible.    

 In  recognition  of  the  importance  of this  consideration, it  must  remain   the right of any Member or Senator, having proper grounds to do so, to  propose the removal of a justice. The parliament should set clear rules  for how such proposals will be dealt with. The processes it adopts must  be as transparent, immune to partisanship and fair as they can be made.   

 Under  section  72  of  the  Constitution,  federal  parliamentarians  cannot   surrender their constitutional responsibility to the Executive. It would  be wrong to think that, consistent with this provision, responsibility for  decisions  about  judicial  fitness  for  office  can  be  left  to  the  Attorney-General. 

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 12

 

 This  is  not  merely  a  matter  of  form.  It  provides  a  substantive  reason   why  recent  Victorian  legislation43,  which  abolishes  the  state   parliament’s  power  to  remove  a  judge  unless  the  Victorian  Attorney-General  has  exercised  his  or  her  discretion  as  to  whether  or  not  they   will (a) appoint an investigating committee and (b) report any adverse  findings to each House, cannot provide a model at the federal level.    

 However, to provide some sanctions against abuse of a process that can  be  triggered  by  any  Member  or  Senator,  safeguards  need  to  be   introduced  to  ensure  the  right  to  propose  the  removal  of  a  justice  is   exercised in good faith. Baseless allegations made by a parliamentarian  against a federal justice should be dealt with as a serious contempt. The  Standing Orders of the House and Senate should be amended to ensure  any  parliamentarian  who,  deliberately  or  recklessly,  puts  forward   baseless  allegations  will  be  suspended  from  the  service  of  the  House   for a substantial minimum period.    

 Furthermore, the Standing Orders of each House should be amended to  insert  a  threshold  procedural  step  to  apply  to  any  proposal  for  the   removal of a justice. This is intended to ensure no further action would  be  taken  on  a  proposal  for  the  removal  of  a  judge  unless  there  is  a   sufficient basis to justify parliament’s further consideration of the case  under section 72. The threshold test would be applied by the Speaker 

 or  President  as  the  case  may  be,  in  much  the  same  way  as  currently   applies to allegations of breaches of parliamentary privilege.    

 It is the current practice of each House that no action can be taken in  respect  of  an  asserted  breach  of  privilege  raised  by  a  Member  or   Senator  unless  the  presiding  officer  gives  the  motion  precedence.    Precedence  will  only  be  granted  if,  inter-alia,  a  prima  facie  case  of   contempt or breach of privilege has been made out44.   

 In  deciding  such  questions  the  Speaker  or  the  President  examines  the   nature  of  the  claim  and  any  material  produced  by  the  Member  or   Senator  and  then  exercises  his  or  her  judgement  as  to  whether  the   matter could involve a breach of the privileges of the House or Senate.  While a Presiding Officer’s threshold judgment can be overturned by a  vote  of  the  Chamber,  in  practice  they  are  not.  Even  a  dispute  is   extremely  rare.  Speakers  and  Presidents  generally  see  this  aspect  of   their role as requiring impartiality and usually seek independent advice  from the Clerk.  

 

 43  Courts Legislation (Judicial Conduct) Act 2005, see s 87AAB(2) and s 87AAH(3).  44  SO 51(d)(i) House of Representatives, see also Senate Resolution 4 referred to below. 

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 13

 

 There have been very few controversies over these types of rulings45. I  see no reason to doubt that Speakers or Presidents would behave with  similar impartiality if the Standing Orders gave them a role to play in  the removal process.   

 Such Standing Orders would require the Speaker or President to decide  whether  or  not  the  Member  or  Senator  had  established  a  proper  case   for  giving  further  consideration  to  the  removal  of  the  justice.  More   specifically  the  Standing  Orders  should  provide  that  the  Speaker  or   President would need to be satisfied:   

 (a)  that  the  allegations  against  the  justice  were  clearly  set   out;    

 (b) that the facts alleged were such that, if they were to be  proven, they could lawfully form a basis for the removal  of the justice for misbehaviour or incapacity; and   

 (c) that the facts alleged had been established46 or that there  were  at  least  reasonable  grounds  for  believing  the   conduct  as  alleged  may  have  occurred  and  that  the   examination of this possibility would be justified47.   

 The Standing Orders should also require that the Speaker or President:   

 (i) advise the justice of the motion; and   

 (ii)  invite  the  justice  to  respond  in  writing50  within  a  short   but reasonable timeframe51.    

 

 45  On 25 February 1998 the Senate agreed to several resolutions, including Resolution 4. Resolution 4  sets out the criteria the President should take into account when determining whether a motion arising  from a matter of privilege is to be given precedence over other business. It provides that the President  shall have regard only to those criteria. It also states priority should not be given to matters “which  appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate”.  46

  For example by conviction for a serious criminal offence. Note this assumes that parliament can use  the findings of courts, tribunals or other commissions of enquiry as a basis for holding an allegation  against a justice to have been proven.  47

  This is a deliberately low threshold. It is advanced  on the basis that the next stage of the process is  intended to provide a fair and impartial forum for assessing the extent of the evidence and its weight.  50  There would of course be no obligation to respond to such an invitation. However the right to make a  submission would provide an opportunity for the early disposal of allegations capable of immediate  disproof - for example Senator Heffernan’s allegations against Justice Kirby.  51

  The need for a reasonably short timeframe is inherent in the section 72 requirement that removal  requires an address from both Houses in the same Session. Delay at the initial stages is likely to make  this condition even more difficult of achievement. 

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 14

 Any submission made by the justice would be required to be taken into  account and reported to the Chamber by the Speaker or President when  tabling their reasons for according, or denying, priority to the motion.    

 Such Standing Orders would ensure that serious issues would have to  be dealt with, while trivial complaints and allegations lacking credible  substance would fall at the threshold.   

 Proposals for the removal of a judge which were not approved by the  Speaker or the President could not proceed further without a resolution  of the House or Senate concerned.    

 2.5 Investigating the allegations   

 If  we  assume  that,  with  such  Standing  Orders  in  place,  priority  was   given by the Speaker or President for a motion for an address for the  removal of the justice, how should the matter then proceed?    

 As  I  see  it,  the  Member  or  Senator  who  initially  raised  the  motion   should be required, by the Standing Orders, to move that motion for an  address  for  removal53.  Debate  on  the  motion  would  then  be   automatically  adjourned  until  the  House  received  a  report  from  an   independent body established by the parliament for this purpose.   

 Can this be done?    

 Quick  and  Garran  were  of  the  opinion  that  section  72  of  the   Constitution “ensur[ed] that the Judge should be heard in defence and  the charge against him should be alleged in the address”54. They stated:   

 Parliament  is  limited  by  restraints  which  require  proof  of   definite  charges;  the  liability  to  removal  is  not  a  qualification   of,  or  exception  from  the  words  creating  a  tenure;  but  only   arises  when  the  conditions  of  the  tenure  are  broken;  and   though the procedure and mode of proof are left entirely to the  Parliament, it would seem that, inasmuch as proof is expressly  required, the duty of Parliament is practically indistinguishable  from a strictly judicial duty55. 

 

 53  If the Member or Senator has been granted leave or is otherwise unable to attend the sitting, permit  any other Member to move the motion for an address.  54

  Para 292, p.729.  55  Para 296, p.731. 

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 15

 

 That  conclusion  may  be  conceded.  However,  Quick  and  Garran  took   their  argument  further  suggesting  that  section  72  requires  a  federal   justice be given a separate trial before the Bar of each Chamber.  They  took the view that neither the House nor Senate could put any reliance  upon the findings of other courts, commissions or, even, its own Select  Committees. They argued: 

 

 The matter is discussed, and the proper procedure indicated, by  Todd,  (Parl.  Gov  in  Eng.,  ii,  860-875)  where  it  is  laid  down   that ‘no address for the removal of a Judge ought be adopted  by  either  House  of  Parliament,  except  after  the  fullest  and   fairest  enquiry  into  the  matter  of  complaint,  by  the  whole   House,  or  a  Committee  of  the  whole  House,  at  the  Bar;   notwithstanding  that  the  same may  have  already  undergone  a   thorough  investigation  before  other  tribunals’—such  as  a   Royal Commission or a Select Committee56.   

 But  is  this  so?  Odgers  points  out  that,  while  this  may  have  been   presumed in the early years after federation to be the correct procedure,  when  in  fact  allegations  against  Justice  Murphy  arose  both  Houses   acted on a common assumption that they could delegate the taking of 

 evidence and the preparation of a report to a Commission or a Select  Committee.    

 The  Senate  took  the  first  step  by  appointing  a  Select  Committee  on   Allegations Concerning a Judge to hold formal hearings and report its  findings  to  the  Senate.  No  action  was  taken  on  its  report  because  of   intervening events.    

 Later,  both  Houses  co-operated  by  passing  legislation  to  establish  a   Parliamentary  Commission  of  Inquiry.   The Parliamentary  Commission of Inquiry was established by statute and was empowered  to  hear  relevant  evidence  and  to  report  its  findings  to  each  House.    Both  Houses  plainly  regarded  themselves  as  being  at  liberty  to  have   regard  to  the  findings  of  the  Commission.  The  work  of  the   Parliamentary  Commission  of  Inquiry  was  terminated  by  further   legislation passed shortly after Justice Murphy had been diagnosed as  terminally  ill.   Thus  it  never  reported  and  its  records  remain  securely   archived. 

 

 56  Para 296, p.731. 

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 16

 

 Odgers states:   

 It is therefore an unresolved question whether the Houses can  act on a hearing of evidence conducted elsewhere.  It may still  be  argued  that,  even  where  the  evidence  has  been  formally   heard  elsewhere,  it  is  necessary  for  the  Houses  to  rehear  the   evidence, and separately, in which case the removal of a judge  under section 72 would be a protracted and difficult business.  It  is  more  likely,  however,  that  the  Houses  would  accept  the   evidence of a committee57.   

 This  seems  a  sound  view.  There  is,  generally,  nothing  to  stop  either   House  taking  the  advice  of  a  body  it  has  created  for  that  purpose.   Moreover,  obvious  practical  difficulties  aside58,  there  are  reasons  of  

 principle to reject proceeding by way of separate trials at the Bar of the  House and Senate respectively.   

 That  is  because  allegations  of  wrongdoing  by  a  judge  can  justify   removal  under  section  72  only  if  incapacity  or  misconduct  is  proven.  This  should  lead  the  Houses  to  adopt  the  most  credible  form  of   investigation  and  proof  that  is  lawfully  available  to  them.  Whatever   may have been the case in 1901, processes akin to impeachment now  fail this test.    

 Both the public interest, and the private interests of any justice whose  conduct  is  brought  into  question,  will  be  better  served  by  a   Commission’s  careful,  impartial  and  professional  examination  and   report  to  the  parliament  than  by  attempts  to  adduce  the  relevant   evidence during a trial at the Bar of the House or Senate.    

 That  is  more  so  when  it  is  realised  that  it  is  patently  unrealistic  to   expect the focussed attention, or indeed the continual presence59, of all  (or  even  most)  Members  or  Senators  during  anything  but  the  shortest   imaginable of possible proceedings.   

 Partisanship  is  another  problem  likely  to  emerge  -  as  it  did  in  the   Murphy case - during a trial at the Bar. Because justices are appointed  on the recommendation of the government of the day, it sometimes is  the case that an appointment, if controversial, is criticised in a partisan  way. Such criticisms may be most unfair but that is not the point.   

 

 57  at p.514.  58  The practical difficulties are however considerable. These practical objections alone would justify a  different approach assuming that approach was constitutionally open.  59

  The quorum for the House of Representatives is one fifth of the number of members. Often even  fewer members are present and the work of the House proceeds unless and until a Member draws  attention to the absence of a quorum. No members attend the Chamber continuously. Similar rules  apply in the Senate. Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry. 

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 17

 If  a  judge  who  has  been  the  subject  of  such  criticism  is  put  on  trial   before the Bar, the risk of an appearance (and perhaps, sometimes, the  reality) of partiality is obvious. The risk of such partiality infecting or  appearing to infect the process will be much lessened if the parliament  was required to take into account, and could, after receiving, take into 

 account, a report from an impartial and independent body.   

 2.6  Constitutional  validity     

 Is  interposing  an  independent  and  impartial  body  to  report  to  each   chamber  inconsistent  with  the  Constitution?  There  seems  little  reason   to doubt the High Court would hold this question to be justiciable60.    

 Whatever  process  is  followed  therefore  must  comply  with  the   requirements of section 72. As Saunders neatly puts it, a judge “can be  dismissed,  but  only  through  a  public  process  which  requires  a  good   reason  to  be  given”61.  The  Constitution  does  not,  however,  prescribe   the procedures or modes of proof that must be followed. It appears to  leave those issues to the determination of the parliament.   

 It follows, in my opinion, that Quick and Garran’s contention that the  Constitution  requires  a  trial  at  the  Bar  of  each  House  is  not  only   impractical and wrong in principle, but also lacking in support from the 

 text of the Constitution.    

 The  passage  containing  Quick  and  Garran’s  argument  relies  for  its   authority  not  on  any  words  in  the  Constitution  but  rather  upon  the   authors’  analysis  of  Todd’s  writing  in  Parliamentary  Government  in   England62. Todd was writing in the late nineteenth century. His views  no doubt represented the best (English) parliamentary practice of more  than  a  century  ago,  but  the  provisions  of  Australia’s  Constitution  do   not  contain  any  explicit  command  requiring  those  practices  to  be   followed today.   

 Even if, for the sake of argument, some constitutional implication can  be derived from the text of section 72 to the effect that a House, when  considering  the  possible  removal  of  a  judge,  must  follow  best   parliamentary  practice,  it  would  not  preclude  an  ambulatory  reading.   Such  a  reading  would  permit  the  High  Court  to  recognise  that  much   parliamentary  practice  has  changed,  both  in  England  and  Australia,   during the past century.

 It  can  hardly  be  implied  that  the  Houses  must  go  back  to  archaic   practices  to  address  contemporary  circumstances. Best  contemporary   parliamentary  practice  would,  in  my  opinion,  require  the  Houses  to   ensure that questions of fact are first referred for careful examination to  an independent and impartial body63.   

 The  argument  that  a  House  of  parliament  must  never  take  account  of   the  findings  of  such  a  body  (or  indeed  of  a  court  or  a  royal  

 commission) also leads to absurd results. Assume a criminal trial had  resulted  in  the  conviction  of  a  federal  justice  for  bribery—in  those   circumstances  it  is  implausible  that  the  House  or  Senate  should  be   forced to ignore the transcript, the findings of the jury and the remarks  of  the  sentencing  judge  and  instead  be  compelled  to  conduct  a  fresh   trial at the Bar rehearing the whole of the evidence afresh.   

 Parliament undoubtedly has the power, as it did in the Murphy case, to  establish an impartial body to make inquiry and to report its findings to  each House. It seems implausible that  the  High Court  would  give  the   slightest credence to an argument that it is impermissible for a House  to  have  regard  to  such  findings  to  help  make  a  decision  whether  its   Members are satisfied the alleged misbehaviour or incapacity had been  “proved” as required by section 72.    

 While any view expressed by Quick and Garran deserves to be treated  with  respect,  in  this  particular  case  their  suggestion  that  the  only   permissible  procedure  would  be  by  way  of  a  trial  at  the  Bar  of  each   House  should  be  rejected.  As  discussed  above,  not  only  does  this   suggestion  lack  any  foundation  in  the  text  of  the  Constitution,  but  it   also  contradicts  their  own  contention  that  section  72  leaves  the   procedure and mode of proof entirely to the parliament64.   

 

 3. A NEW STATUTORY SCHEME   

 3.1  A  Parliamentary (Judicial Misbehaviour or Incapacity) Commission   

 How  then  might  such  a  transparent,  fair  and  independent  body  to   enquire and report be established?   

 Without  a  statutory  basis,  Parliament  could  not  achieve  what  is   required.  As  Odgers  notes,  although  either  House  can  appoint   investigators  to  gather  evidence,  such  investigators,  unless  authorised   by  statute,  would  have  no  power  to  compel  testimony,  summons   witnesses or require the attendance of witnesses.  

 

 63  The most recent example is the Courts Legislation (Judicial Conduct) Act 2005 (Vic).  64  Para 296, p.731. 

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 19

 

 Conversely, while a Select Committee of either House could be given  such  powers,  parliamentary  committees  are  poorly  equipped  to   undertake  investigations.  In  Odgers  words  “select  committees  are   designed to hear evidence rather than gather evidence”65. Setting up an  independent  body  vested  with  all  the  appropriate  powers  to  gather   evidence,  evaluate  it  and  report  findings  to  both  Houses,  requires  an   Act of the parliament.   

 I  therefore  propose  that  a  new  statutory  body  be  created  -  the   Parliamentary  (Judicial  Misbehaviour  or  Incapacity)  Commission   ("PJMIC"),  for  want  of  a  better  title  -vested  with  wide-ranging   powers,  akin  to  those  of  a  Royal  Commission,  to  investigate   complaints  of  judicial  misconduct  referred  to  it  by  a  House  of  the   parliament.    

 The use of a commission with statutory powers for this purpose is not  unprecedented.  As  discussed  above,  a  Parliamentary  Commission  of   Inquiry  was  established  to  investigate  the  Murphy  allegations.  What   may  be  new  are  the  proposals  for  the  membership  and  powers  now   advanced.    

 The  discussion  that  follows  in  this  paper  makes  recommendations   about  what  the  legislation  constituting  the PJMIC  should  provide.  It   does  so  to  propose  answers  to  two  broad  questions.  First,  what  form   should the Commission take? Second, what powers and responsibilities 

 should the parliament give to the Commission?    

 The  latter  is  most  important  because  the  Murphy  controversy   highlighted that many fundamental matters - such as whether or not a  judge  can  exercise  the  privilege  against  self-incrimination  -  have  no   agreed answers. They need to be settled.    

 Although this paper makes a number of recommendations about these  contested  issues,  what  is  most  important   is  not  that  they  be  resolved   precisely  in  the  manner  I  propose,  but  rather  that  they  be  settled  in   advance of a controversy arising.

 3.2 The Form of the Commission   

 (a) Continuing or ad hoc membership?   

 Members  of  the  PJMIC  should  not  be  appointed  on  a  case  by   case basis66.   

 Standing  appointments  would  remove  any  perception  that  a   particular outcome could be engineered and would ensure there  were  always  impartial  members  ready  to  undertake  the   Commission’s  work  as  required.  There  is  also  the  question  of   the  time  it  could  take  for  ad  hoc  appointments  to  be  made  -   time which would better be spent on resolving the case itself.   

 For those reasons, I believe a Commission with standing, rather  than an ad-hoc, membership should be established.   

 The members of the PJMIC should be appointed as soon as is  convenient  after  the  legislation  constituting  the  Commission   comes into force.    

 Members  should  receive  a  suitable  honorarium  for  holding   themselves  available  to  serve,  and  should  be  entitled  to  per-diem  payments  if  matters  are  referred  to  them.  Both  the   honorarium  and  the  per-diem  payments  should  be  

 independently set by the Remuneration Tribunal.   

 (b) The number of Commissioners   

 There  is  no  overwhelming  case  for  the  appointment  of  any   specific  number  of  commissioners.  However,  one  

 commissioner would be too few.    

 A  justice  whose  conduct  came  to  be  in  issue  could  

 understandably object if the preliminary assessment of the facts  was  placed  in  the  hands  of  only  one  person,  no  matter  how   impartial and well credentialed that person was. But there is no  advantage  in  large  numbers.  The  Commission  would  quickly   become  unwieldy.  I  propose  that  the  PJMIC be  made  up  of   three members. 

 

 66  This may have to yield to higher obligations of natural justice if, for example, a permanent member  of the Commission has had previous dealings with the justice and is obliged to disqualify his or herself  for actual or apprehended bias. In such cases an ad hoc appointment to fill the vacancy may be  unavoidable. 

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 21

 

 (c)  By  whom  appointed  

 

 By  whom  should  such  members  be  appointed?  Given  that  the   Commission  will  be  acting  as  the  agent  of  the  Houses   undertaking their function under section 72 of the Constitution,  the  normal  mode  of  appointment  by  the  Executive  is   inappropriate.  I  therefore  propose  that  the  President  of  the   Senate and the Speaker make these appointments jointly.    

 I  propose  they  do  so  on  the  basis  that  two  of  the  three   Commissioners would be appointed on recommendation of the  leader  of  the  largest  party  in  the  House  (the  Prime  Minister),   and  one  on  the  recommendation  of  the  leader  of  the  largest   party  not  forming  part  of  the  government  (the  Leader  of  the   Opposition). Forming the Commission in this way would lift it  above the usual ruck of partisan politics.   

 It  would  also  mean  that  supporters  of  any  justice  whose   conduct became the subject of the PJMIC’s examination would  not  be  able  to  impute  ill  motives  to  the  tribunal  which   parliament  had  entrusted  to  examine  the  justice’s  conduct  or  

 fitness to hold office.    

 Vacancies  in  the  PJMIC  would  need  to  be  filled  by  a  similar   process  to  that  of  the  initial  appointments-ie  by  the  Speaker   and President jointly on the recommendation of, in the case of a  member  previously  nominated  by  the  Prime  Minister,  by  the   Prime  Minister,  and,  in  the  case  of  a  member  previously   nominated  by  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  by  the  Leader  of   the Opposition.   

 (d) Qualifications for serving on the Commission   

 I  believe  it  is  preferable  to  have  a  mix  of  persons  represented   on  the  PJMIC.  But  what  is  vital  is  that  each  of  the  ten   Commissioners must be a person of independence and integrity.  No Prime Minister or Leader of the Opposition would want to  endure  the  controversy  of  nominating  persons  lacking  any   standing  to  undertake  this  task.  Without  wanting  to  limit  the   pool of persons who may be appointed Commissioners, the one  justifiable  restriction  would  be  that  Commissioners  should   always  include  at  least  one  retired  federal  or  state  judge  of  a   superior  court  -  but  the  appointment  of  sitting  federal  judges   can  be  ruled  out.  Beyond  that  the  legislation  establishing  the   Commission  need  not  set  out  prescribed  qualifications  for   membership. 

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 22

 

 The reason sitting federal judges can not be appointed is to be  found  in  the  structure  of  the  Constitution.  The  doctrine  of  the   separation  of  powers  prohibits  sitting  federal  judicial  officers   exercising  non-judicial  powers  that  are  inconsistent  with  their  

 Chapter  III  responsibilities.  While  the  PJMIC  would  be   required  to  “act  judicially”  in  an  administrative  law  sense67,  it   would be a creature of the parliament.    

 The appointment of a serving federal justice as a Commissioner  would be open to legal challenge on the basis that the exercise  of that office is inconsistent with the exercise of judicial power.    

 If there are good reasons why sitting federal justices should be  appointed  to  the  Commission,  it  might  be  plausible  to  risk   constitutional challenge to such an appointment but there is no  benefit, I see, that justifies that risk.   

 Indeed  it  can  be  argued  that  it  is  inappropriate  for  a  sitting   judge to be asked to gather and evaluate evidence about one of  their  fellows  who,  at  the  time  of  the  Commission’s  enquiries,   would  still  be  sitting  member  of  the  bench.   It  would  look   wrong—like Caesar judging Caesar.    

 In  the  event  that  the  judge  concerned  was  not  removed  from   office  it  might  also  be  difficult  for  that  judge  to  continue   working  alongside  a  member  of  the  Commission  who  had   examined  his  or  her  affairs  so  intimately  and  in  such   controversial circumstances.    

 (e) Counsel assisting and the right to be legally represented    

 In order to carry out the fact-finding part of the Commission’s  brief, if will be necessary to give the Commissioners power to  appoint counsel to assist them undertake their tasks.   

 Under  its  enabling  statute,  the  PJMIC  should  be  given  the   power  to  appoint  counsel  assisting  without  reference  back  to   parliament.   

 Fairness also requires that a justice whose conduct or capacity  has been referred to the Commission for report is entitled to be  legally represented.   

 

 67  See Shimon Shetreet, Judges on Trial: A Study of the Appointment and Accountability of the English  Judiciary, North-Holland Publishing Company, 1976, p.135: “...on the whole, it is clear that the  proceedings have been deemed judicial in nature and procedural safeguards protecting the accused  judge, as well as public confidence in the courts, have been followed. That the proceedings for an  address have been deemed judicial also appears from the frequent reference by Members to  proceedings for impeachment in support of their views of the proper procedural course which should be  followed by the House upon a motion for an address for removal”.  

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 23

 

 The legislation should provide that a justice under investigation  is  entitled  to  legal  representation  but  allow  the  Commission   discretion as to whether or not any other person or body can be  legally represented68.   

 Legal  costs  of  the  justice  appearing  before  the  Commission   should  be  met  under  the  Commonwealth's  Special  

 Circumstances  Scheme  which  can,  by  the  Attorney-General's   direction, provide non-means tested legal assistance69.   

 3.3 The Procedures, Powers and Responsibilities of the Commission   

 (a)  Misbehaviour  and  criminality:  should  ‘misbehaviour’  be   limited to criminal conduct?   

 Proceedings  under  section  72  of  the  Constitution  are  not   criminal  in nature. No  deprivation of liberty  is at  stake.  There   may be punishment, in the sense of losing one’s tenure, and the  public humiliation and disgrace which would inevitably follow  a  removal.  But  the  standard  of  conduct  required  of  a  judicial   officer  is  different  (and  higher)  than  that  required  of  other   citizens  whose  conduct  is  only  constrained  by  the  laws  of  the   jurisdiction in which they live.   

 As holders of public office, and as persons who are often seen  as  the  objective  representation  of  the  law  itself  to  those  who   appear  before  them,  the  conduct  of  judicial  officers  has  to  be   constrained  by  other  far  more  nebulous  factors  than  the   boundary between what is, and is not, criminal.   

 There have, in the past, been suggestions that only criminality  or,  slightly  more  widely,  some  serious  defect  in  the  direct   performance  of  judicial  duties,  can  constitute  misbehaviour  of   the kind referred to in section 72 of the Constitution71. This was  the  opinion  the  Commonwealth  Solicitor-General  tendered  in   198472. 

 

 68  Cf section 87AAG(1) Courts Legislation (Judicial Conduct) Act 2005 (Vic).  69  Guidelines for the Special Circumstances Scheme are set out at Annexure A.  71

  See Odgers pp.509-510 and Shetreet, note 65 supra, pp.88-89.  72  Odgers, p.509. 

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 24

 

 Notwithstanding  that  opinion,  the  Commissioners  inquiring   into  the  allegations  against  the  late  Mr  Justice  Murphy  took  a   broader  view.  They  stated  that  any  conduct  that  “indicated   unfitness  of  a  judge  to  continue  in  office”  could  amount  to   “misbehaviour”  for  the  purposes  of  section  7273.  This  broader   definition has its roots in the long-standing conventions of the  English  parliament  which  consider  it  appropriate  to  take  into   account  the  effect  on  public  confidence  of  a  judicial  officer’s   behaviour.   

 Shimon  Shetreet’s74,  detailed  survey  of the  English  authorities  on removal up to the mid-1970s, provides various formulations  of what has been held to amount to misbehaviour.    

 It  includes  behaviour  which  “seriously  impaired  public   confidence”, or was “letting down the judiciary or lowering the  dignity of the bench”, or, in more colourful terms attributed to  Lord  Denning,  would  “lead  people  to  point  a  finger  of  scorn   saying,  ‘who  made  thee  a  ruler  and  a  judge  over  us’?”75  All   constituted,  in  Shetreet’s  survey,  behaviour  which  would   warrant  a  judge's  removal  from  office  under  the  Act of  Settlement76.   

 Shetreet’s  analysis  supports  the  approach  taken  by  the   Commissioners  in  the Murphy  case.   In  my  opinion  the   Commission  was  correct  to  reject  the  then  Solicitor-General’s   opinion  and  to  apply  the  broader  view  of  section  72  

 “misbehaviour”.  Not  only  was  the  Commissioners’  approach   consistent  with  the  English  authorities  surveyed  by  Shetreet,   their  approach  was  (and  remains)  consistent  with  prevailing   community  expectations  about  the  standard  of  conduct  for   those who are holders of federal judicial office.77   

 Although the issue would therefore seem relatively well settled,  in  order  to  prevent  future  uncertainty  the  legislation   establishing  the  PJMIC should  prescribe  and  adopt  the  wider   view of what may amount to misbehaviour.

  The Chief Justices of Australia recently produced a Guide to Judicial Conduct published the  Australian Institute of Judicial Administration in 2002. The Guide is intended to provide "some  practical guidance" about conduct expected of judicial officers in Australia which "should reflect the  changes in community standards over the years" (Preface to the Guide). 

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 25

 

 (b)  Criminal conduct charged or established   

 Notwithstanding  that  the  broader  test  of  misbehaviour  is   recommended,  the  PJMIC  could  find  itself  called  on  to   consider  the  conduct  of  a  judge  after  criminal  charges  have   been brought against him or her, or a conviction obtained.    

 How  should  matters  proceed  when   the  subject  matter  of  the   inquiry  also  forms  the  basis  for  a  concurrent  criminal   prosecution?    

 If a judge’s trial for a crime is pending, proper respect for the  trial  process  would  generally  constrain  the  conduct  of  the   Commission’s  enquiries.  However,  given  that  the  PJMIC  would be acting in discharge of one of the parliament’s specific  constitutional  responsibilities  this  would  almost  certainly  be  a   matter of comity rather than obligation78.   

 If  that  is  so,  the  legal  position  of  the  PJMIC   would  contrast   with  that  of  a  Royal  Commission  which,  notwithstanding  its   terms  of  reference,  can  be  required  by  the  law  of  contempt  to   refrain from hearing evidence or other wise acting in a manner  which might prejudice a criminal prosecution79.    

 If  a  conviction  has  been  recorded  against  the  judicial  officer   concerned, it could be the basis of a report to parliament for the  purpose of a removal provided that the conduct covered by the  conviction  is  the  same  conduct  as  has  been  referred  to  the    PJMIC for investigation and report.    

 Subject to any appeal against the conviction to a higher court,  the Commission (and the Houses of the parliament) ought to be  entitled to rely upon the fact of the conviction, the transcript of  evidence,  and  the  trial  judge’s  remarks  on  sentence  without   having to duplicate the task of the jury.   

 A  criminal  conviction  might  affect  the  Commission’s   proceedings  in  a  further  way  -  the  proceedings  might  need  to   be expedited to enable the parliament to act quickly to remove 

 the convicted judicial officer from the bench.  

 

 78  If a House chose to proceed directly by trial at the Bar in discharge of its responsibilities under  section 72, it could not be injuncted. Given that the Parliamentary (Judicial Misbehaviour or  Incapacity) Commission would not have jurisdiction to consider the conduct of a federal justice unless  the matter were referred to it by a House of the Parliament and that once it received such a referral it  would be carrying out its functions as a Commission of the Parliament it would be surprising if an  injunction could run against it. There may be occasional circumstances where the public interest would  require prompt attention to removal notwithstanding overlapping criminal proceedings.  79

  See Hammond v Cth (1982) 152 CLR 188. 

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 26

 

 It is well, however, to remember that criminal convictions will  vary greatly in the gravity of the conduct concerned. The failure  to  lodge  tax  returns  can  be  -  and  has  been  in  Victoria  -  the   cause  of  a  criminal  conviction  for  judges.  In  that  case  -   presumably  because  of  differences  in  the  circumstances  -  one   judge resigned, the other remained in office. This is because a  conviction need not be determinative of the question of fitness  for office under section 72    

 Frequently  the  context  of  the  conviction  may  require  further   exploration. Most, but not all, crimes are morally blameworthy.   

 Surprisingly  to  some,  an  acquittal  would  not  absolve  the   Commission from further responsibility to inquire into the case  of alleged misconduct referred to it.    

 An acquittal from conviction does not mean the conduct alleged  did  not  occur.  All  it  means  is  that  the  jury  was  not  persuaded   ‘beyond  reasonable  doubt’.  Further,  as  discussed  above,   criminal  guilt,  or  the  absence  of  it,  is  not  a  measure  of  the   standard  of  conduct  required  of  federal  judicial  officers.  The   parameters  of  public  office,  and  public  confidence,  are  more   nebulous  than  that  of  criminality.  A  reasonable  doubt  about   matters as alleged by the prosecution in a criminal trial can co-exist  with  a  conviction  in  the  minds  of  parliamentarians,  and   the  community  they  represent,  that  someone  is  not  fit  to  hold   judicial office. The reprehensible is not always made criminal.   

 (c)  The privilege against self-incrimination    

 When  allegations  were  made  against  the  late  Mr  Justice   Murphy,  His  Honour  claimed  that  a  federal  justice  facing  an   address  for  removal  was  entitled  to  assert  the  privileges  of  an   accused person at trial, including a right to submit an unsworn  statement  and  the  privilege  against  self-incrimination80.  These   claims were accepted in each of the parliamentary inquiries he  faced.  Justice  Murphy  was  permitted  to  give  unsworn   statements and was not cross-examined81.     

 The  former  right  to  give  unsworn  statements  in  criminal  trials   has since been generally discredited. It would be anomalous if  this  anachronistic  right  was  retained  in  the  case  of  a  judge   facing  proceedings  for  removal.   The  legislation  constituting   the PJMIC  should  codify  the  abolition  of  a  justice’s  right  to   make an unsworn statement in Commission proceedings.

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 27

 Further, the privilege against self-incrimination remains a vital  part  of  the  rights  of  persons  accused  of  crimes,  it  is  far  from   clear that parliament should continue to allow  judicial officers  who are the subject of possible removal to claim this privilege.  Judges hold high constitutional office. Their private rights need  to  be  balanced  against  the  public  interest  of  ensuring   confidence in the incorruptibility of judicial conduct.    

 If  the  Speaker  or  the  President  has  found  a  threshold  case  for   removal  of  a  judge  exists,  it  would  offend  common  sense  and   community  expectations  if  the  Commission  and  the  Houses   could  not  draw  adverse  inferences  if  that  judge,  rather  than   clearing  a  matter  up,  refuses  to  answer  questions  and  claims   privilege.   

 Odgers states:   

 It may well be contended that, as a holder of high office  in  whom  the  public  must  have  confidence,  a  judge   should be obliged to answer any case reasonably made  against him82.   

 (d) Compellability of judges   

 The  above  statement  by  Odgers  raises  the  additional  question   of  whether  a  judicial  officer  appearing  before  the  PJMIC  should be compelled to testify.   

 There  are  several  options  available  to  the  parliament.  But   starting  from  first  principles  it  is  difficult  to  imagine  how   proceedings  for  a  removal  under  section  72  could  be  most   effectively  conducted  if  the  Commission  can  not  require   testimony  from  the  judicial  officer  concerned  and,  if  the   circumstances make it relevant, from other judicial officers83.   

 Assuming  a  judge  will  be  required  to  give  evidence  to  the   Commission,  a  strong  case  can  be  made  that,  consistent  with   the  general  tenor  of  the  Parliamentary  Privileges  Act  1987,  such statements, made under compulsion, should not be able to  be  used  directly  as  evidence  against  the  justice  in  any  related   criminal trial. 

 

 82  Odgers, p.517.  83  Odgers, pp.515-516. 

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 28

 

 This  could  be  achieved  by  denying  a  privilege  against  self-incrimination  but  giving  protection  to  a  judge  who  is  required   to  testify  before  the  Commission  either  by  conferring  full   transactional immunity or use immunity, similar to that offered 

 to  witnesses  compelled  to  give  evidence  in  Australian  Crime   Commission proceedings to prevent that evidence being used to  convict the justice in related criminal trials.    

 To  deny  immunity  absolutely  would  conflict  with  a  citizen’s   right  not  to  be  compelled  to  give  criminal  testimony  against   him  or  herself.  Even  in  the  case  of  a  judge,  who  may  be   expected to owe a duty to cooperate with the Commission, not  conferring some form of immunity in later court proceedings is  neither necessary nor justifiable.   

 The  legislation  establishing  the  PJMIC  should  therefore   provide  that justices  are  compellable  witnesses  before  the   Commission. The legislation should clarify that justices are not  entitled to claim privilege against self incrimination but should  confer  either  transactional  or  use  immunity  in  respect  of  any   admissions so made.   

 (e)  The standard of proof required   

 The  standard  of  proof  required  is  a  contentious  issue.  It  was   contentious  in  the  Murphy  case,  where  Justice  Murphy   contended  the  criminal  standard  of  proof  beyond  reasonable   doubt ought to apply.    

 The  Second  Senate  Select  Committee  enquiring  into  his   conduct  was  asked  to  make  its  findings  on  both  the  civil   balance  of  probabilities  standard  and  the  criminal  one84.  The   question  of  which  was  the  appropriate  standard  was  left   unresolved85.   

 Ultimately, a choice must be made. In my opinion, the balance  of probabilities test as defined by the Evidence Act (Cth) 1995  is  the  appropriate  standard  to  apply  in  inquiries  of  this  kind86.  The civil standard, so defined, requires a degree of confidence  which  increases  as  the  importance  of  the  inquiry,  and  the   gravity of the matters alleged, increases. Given the seriousness  inherent in the removal of a judge, a high level of confidence,  but not the criminal standard, would be required.

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 29

 

 As previously discussed, removal proceedings are not criminal  prosecutions.  For  this  reason  alone,  the  criminal  standard  of   proof is not appropriate.   

 As Odgers notes, a finding that misbehaviour or incapacity has  not been proven ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ can co-exist with a  firmly held belief that someone is unfit to hold a judicial office:   

 It  may  be  thought  to  be  irresponsible  for  the  Houses   to leave a judge on the bench when it is probable that  the  judge  has  engaged  in  acts  constituting  grave   misbehaviour  simply  because  proof  beyond   reasonable doubt is lacking87.   

 (f) The compellability of witnesses   

 The  PJMIC  would  need  wide-ranging  powers  to  allow  it  to   obtain the information it required. It would also need powers to  compel the production of documents and other 'hard' evidence.   

 The  Commission  should  be  vested  with  the  same  powers  to   compel  the  production  of  evidence  as  would  a  House  of  the   parliament itself.     

 In addition, analogous provisions to those in section 87AF (2)  and (3) of the Courts  Legislation  (Judicial  Conduct) Act  2005  (Vic) should be included to remove any doubt that a person will  not  be  excused  from  answering  a  question  or  producing  any   document  required  by  the  Commission  on  the  ground  that   answering  the  question  or  the  production  of  the  document  is   prohibited by other legislation.    

 Issues which require confidentiality can be addressed in camera  -  although  the  proceedings  of  the  Commission  should  be   conducted in public to the greatest degree possible.   

 (g) Applying the rules of evidence   

 The task of the PJMIC is to enable parliament to make as fully  informed  decision  as  possible  in  the  exercise  of  its  

 constitutional  powers.  It  is  for  this  end  alone  that  the   Commission carries out its functions. 

 

 87  Odgers, p.514. 

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 30

 

 Royal  Commissions  and  other  bodies  established  by  the   executive  and  the  parliament  having  similar  obligations  to   inquire  and  report  are  not  usually  constrained  to  apply  the   technical  rules  of  evidence.  They  are  however  obliged  to   conduct their inquiries in a manner that complies with the rules  of  natural  justice.  An  'investigating  committee'  established  in   Victoria  to  conduct  a  similar  function  under  state  law  is  not   bound  by  the  rules  of  evidence  and  may  be  informed  in  any   manner it considers appropriate88.   

 While  reasonable  minds  could  well  differ  on  this  point,  there   would seem to be no sufficient reason not to follow that general  approach  in  the  legislation  establishing  the  PJMIC.  The   legislation should provide that the Commission is not bound by  the rules of evidence but must act in accordance with the rules  of natural justice.   

 (h) When Parliament is dissolved   

 It is possible that a case referred to the Commission could still  be under investigation at the time parliament is dissolved.  The  legislation  establishing  the  PJMIC  should,  in  those   circumstances allow the Commission to report to the incoming  parliament.   

 The legislation should clarify that a later Session is entitled to  receive and deliberate upon the Commission’s report.   

 (i) Witness protections    

 Given  its  status  as  a  body  exercising  the  powers  of,  and   reporting  to,  parliament  members  of  the  Commission  should   receive the same protection from suit as would members of the  relevant Chambers.   

 For  similar  reasons,  witnesses  should  be  given  the  same   protection from legal suit as they would under the terms of the  Parliamentary  Privileges  Act  1987  as  if  they  had  been   questioned or examined by a house or a committee of a house.

 However, parliament should take the occasion to amend section  16(3)  of  the  Parliamentary  Privileges  Act  1987.  The   amendment  would  permit  the  later  cross-examination  of   witnesses  not  accused  of  a  crime  as  to  prior  inconsistent   statements89. The current operation of section 16(3) in denying  that  possibility  carries  parliamentary  privilege  further  than  is   necessary or desirable. This denial has the potential to prevent  the giving of evidence that in some future case may be vital to  the  rights  of  a  person  on  trial  or  to  the  just  outcome  of  civil   litigation.    

 3.4 Reports of the Commission to the Houses   

 (a) Submitting Reports to the Houses   

 Once  the  Commission  has  completed  its  investigation  of  the   matter(s)  referred  to  it,  the  Commission  would  be  obliged  to   provide  a  report  to  both  Houses  through  the  Speaker  and  the   President.    

 The PJMIC’s report must be comprehensive, must annex a full  transcript  of  its  proceedings.  It  must  state  the  Commission’s   conclusion  as  to  whether  facts  amounting  to  proved   misbehaviour  or  incapacity  exist  such  as  would  warrant  the   removal of the justice from office90.   

 Among  the  three  Commissioners  it  is  possible  there  may  be  a   dissenting  opinion.  In  the  interests  of  a  fully  informed   parliament all opinions, including any dissenting one, should be 

 reported by the Commission.   

 (b) Procedure of the Houses after receipt of a Report   

 The  Standing  Orders  of  each  House  should  provide  that  upon   the  Presiding  Officer  tabling  a  report  from  the  PJMIC  stating   that  removal  of  the  justice  is  warranted, debate  on  the  motion   for an address of removal would immediately commence.91  

 

 89  On 20 June 2005 my Private Member’s Bill, the Parliamentary Privileges Amendment Bill 2005 to  amend section 16(3) was given a first reading.  For background see, Sir Clarrie Harders Parliamentary  Privilege v The Courts; Cross-examination of committee witnesses Parliamentary Library Information  and Research Service Paper October 1991.   90

  This is a modified restatement of the provisions of s 87AAH(2) of the Courts Legislation (Judicial  Conduct) Act 2005 (Vic). Note the Victorian Act requires a report to the Attorney-General as to  whether the conduct could amount to proved incapacity or misbehaviour.  91

  See Shetreet, note 65 supra, p.137. Provision should also be made to allow a new motion to be  moved in those cases where the Report is tabled in a subsequent Parliament, that is, after an intervening  election.

 However, if the Report of the Commission does not find facts  amounting to proved misbehaviour or incapacity, such as would  warrant the removal of the justice concerned, no further action  or debate on the motion should be permitted92.   

 All Members and Senators should be provided with the Report  of the PJMIC and should be entitled to inspect all the original  documents and exhibits referred to in it.   

 The  Standing  Orders  should  guarantee  the  right  of  a  justice,   whose conduct is the subject of the Report, by his or herself, or  by counsel, to address each chamber from the Bar of the House.  That is a matter required by both common-sense and fairness.    

 However,  no  other  witness  should  be  heard  except  with  the   leave  of  the  House.  Members  and  Senators  should  not  allow   themselves  to  be  drawn  into  a  rehearing  of  all  the  evidence.   They  should  not  vote  for  removal  unless  they  are  satisfied  on   the  basis  of  the  materials  before  them,  that  misbehaviour  or   incapacity has been proven.   

 Only  in  exceptional  circumstances,  such  as  the  disclosure  of   fresh  evidence  or  other  matters  not  considered  by  the   Commission, should additional submissions be heard. This will  enable  parliamentary  debate  to  proceed  in  an  orderly  way  on   the  basis  of  members’  or  senators’  evaluation  of  the  findings   and conclusions of the PJMIC.   

 After debate each House would determine its view, by a vote of  its  members,  as  to  whether  misbehaviour  or  incapacity  had   been proven in accordance with the test provided for by section  72 of the Constitution.    

 

 92  Whether the legislation constituting the Commission would need to go so far as to prohibit the  Governor General in Council from acting on an address praying for the removal of a justice where the  Commission had not so concluded may be doubted. It is unimaginable that a House would proceed to  such a conclusion against the advice of the Commission. However, some might think it prudent to do  so in order to remove the most remote possibility of a removal in those circumstances. For an  analogous provision see section 87AAB(2) Courts Legislation (Judicial Conduct) Act 2005 (Vic)

 4.  CONCLUSION  

 

 As Chief Justice Murray Gleeson said to an audience of fellow judges in 2002:   

 [Public] confidence is not maintained by stifling legitimate criticism  of courts or of their decisions.   

 When serious complaints of misconduct or incapacity are made against federal  justices the provisions of section 72 of the Constitution become relevant.   

 This paper has explored how, should the need arise, members of the Australian  parliament can best undertake their constitutional responsibilities.   

 A summary of the key proposals is as follows.   

 â¢ It  must  remain  the  right  of  any  Member  or  Senator,  having  proper   grounds to do so, to propose the removal of a justice.   

 â¢ The Standing Orders of the House and Senate should be amended to  provide that any parliamentarian who, deliberately or recklessly, puts  forward  baseless  allegations  will  be  suspended  from  the  service  of   the House for a substantial minimum period.  

 

 â¢ The  Standing  Orders  of  each  House  should  provide  for  a  threshold   procedural step to apply to any proposal for the removal of a justice.   

 â¢ To meet the threshold test the Speaker or President would need to be  satisfied:  1. that  the  allegations  against  the  justice  were  clearly  set   out; 

 

 2. that the facts alleged were such that, if they were to be  proven, they could lawfully form a basis for the removal  of the justice for misbehaviour or incapacity; and   

 3. either  (i)  that  the  facts  alleged  had  been  established  or   (ii) that there were reasonable grounds for  believing the  conduct  alleged  may  have  occurred  and  that  

 examination of this possibility would be justified.    

 â¢ The  Standing  Orders  should  also  require  that  the  Speaker  or   President  (a)  advise  the  justice  of  the  motion;  and  (b)  invite  the   justice to respond in writing within a short but reasonable timeframe. 

 

 â¢ If the Speaker or the President found the threshold test to have been  met  debate  on  the  motion  would  then  be  automatically  adjourned   until the House received a report from the PJMIC.

 â¢ The PJMIC should  be  a  standing  body  created  by  legislation  and   constituted by three members including at least one retired federal or  state judge of a superior court.   

 â¢ Two  of  the  three  Commissioners  would  be  appointed  on  

 recommendation of the leader of the largest party in the House (the  Prime Minister), and one on the recommendation of the leader of the  largest  party  not  forming  part  of  the  government  (the  Leader  of  the   Opposition).   

 â¢ Vacancies in the PJMIC would be filled by a similar process to that  of  the  initial  appointments  -  that  is,  by  the  Speaker  and  President   jointly on the recommendation of, in the case of a member previously  nominated by the Prime Minister, by the Prime Minister, and, in the  case  of  a  member  previously  nominated  by  the  Leader  of  the   Opposition, by the Leader of the Opposition. 

 

 â¢ Under  its  enabling  statute  the  PJMIC should  be  given  the  power  to   appoint counsel assisting without reference back to parliament.   

 â¢ The  legislation  should  provide  that  a  justice  whose  fitness  to  hold   office  is  under  investigation  is  entitled  to  legal  representation  but   allow the PJMIC a discretion as to whether or not any other person  or body can be legally represented. Costs of a justice so represented  should  be  provided  for  under  the  Commonwealth  Special   Circumstances Scheme on a non-means tested basis.   

 â¢ The legislation establishing the PJMIC should adopt the wider view  of  what  may  amount  to  misbehaviour.  It  should  not  be  restricted  to   conduct which amounts to the commission of a criminal offence.    

 â¢ The legislation constituting the PJMIC should clarify that there is no  right to make an unsworn statement in Commission proceedings.   

 â¢ The  legislation  establishing  the  PJMIC  should  provide  that justices  are compellable witnesses before the Commission.    

 â¢ The  legislation  should  clarify  that  justices  are  not  entitled  to  claim   privilege  against  self  incrimination  but  should  confer  either   transactional or use immunity in respect of any admissions so made.   

 â¢ The  PJMIC  should  apply  as  the  standard  of  proof,  the  balance  of   probabilities test as defined by the Evidence Act (Cth) 1995.   

 â¢ The Commission should be vested with the same powers to compel  the production of evidence as would a House of the parliament itself.   

 THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES: QUI CUSTODIO CUSTODIS ? 35

 

 â¢ Analogous  provisions  to  those  in  section  87AF  (2)  and  (3)  of  the   Courts  Legislation  (Judicial  Conduct)  Act  2005  (Vic)  should  be   included  to  remove  any  doubt  that  a  person  is  not  excused  from   answering  a  question  or  producing  any  document  required  by  the   Commission  on  the  ground  that  answering  the  question,  or  the   production of the document, is prohibited by other legislation.    

 â¢ The  legislation  should  provide  that  the  PJMIC  is  not  bound  by  the   rules of evidence but must act in accordance with the rules of natural  justice.    

 â¢ Given its status as a body exercising the powers of and reporting to  parliament,  members  of  the  PJMIC  should  receive  and  protection   from suit as would members of the relevant Chambers. 

 

 â¢ Witnesses should be given the same protection from legal suit as they  would under the terms of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 had  they  been  questioned  or  examined  by  a  House  or  a  committee  of  a   House.  Parliament  should  take  the  occasion  to  amend  section  16(3)   of  the  Parliamentary  Privileges  Act  1987  to  permit  later  cross-examination in limited circumstances.   

 â¢ The Report of the PJMIC’s must be comprehensive and must annex a  full  transcript  of  its  proceedings.  It  must  state  the  Commission’s   conclusion as to whether facts amounting to proved misbehaviour or  incapacity  exist  such  as  would  warrant  the  removal  of  the  justice   from office.   

 â¢ Upon the Presiding Officer tabling a report from the PJMIC stating  that removal of the justice is warranted, debate on the motion for an  address of removal would immediately commence.    

 â¢ If  the  Report  of  the  PJMIC does  not  conclude  that facts  exist  

 amounting  to  proved  misbehaviour  or  incapacity  such  as  would   warrant  the  removal  of  the  justice  exist,  no  further  action  or  debate   on the motion should be permitted.   

 â¢ The  Standing  Orders  should  guarantee  the  right  of  a  justice,  whose   conduct is the subject of the Report by his or herself, or by counsel,  to address each chamber from the Bar of the House.   

 â¢ No other witness should be heard except with the leave of the House.   

 â¢ After  debate  each  House  would  determine  its  view,  by  a  vote  of  its  members, as to whether misbehaviour or incapacity had been proven  in  accordance  with  the  test  provided  for  by  section  72  of  the   Constitution.
