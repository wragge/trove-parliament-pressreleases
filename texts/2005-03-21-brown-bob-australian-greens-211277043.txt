 Bob Brown, Senator for Tasmania   

 Nauru and Christmas Island Detainees Should be  Brought to Australia 

 21st Mar 05 

 Greens Senator Bob Brown says Federal Cabinet must also consider bringing long term 

 detainees on Christmas Island and Nauru to mainland Australia. 

 

 “Some of Australia’s longest term detainees are on Nauru with 48 adults and 6 children 

 locked up since 2001,” Senator Brown said.   

 

 “Meanwhile 38 (28 adults and 10 children) remain locked up on Christmas Island. 

 

 “The discussion by federal cabinet of long term detainees must consider those outside 

 mainland Australia as well as those behind the razor wire at places like Baxter. 

 

 “Now that the Prime Minister has become directly involved in rolling back this cruel and 

 inhumane system, he should bring back all those on Nauru and Christmas Island for 

 processing here as a prelude to releasing them into the Australian community. 

 

 “The brutality of the offshore detention centres has shamed this country. 

 

 “I praise those on the Liberal backbench who are speaking up and joining the thousands of 

 Australians who have been working for change for so long,” Senator Brown said. 

 

 Senator Brown’s colleagues Senator Nettle and SA Greens MP Kris Hanna will visit Baxter 

 Detention Centre tomorrow
