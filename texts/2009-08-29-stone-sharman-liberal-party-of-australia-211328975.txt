 THE HON DR SHARMAN STONE MP   

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

          Saturday 29 August 2009 

 

 Arrival of 28th boat of asylum seekers highlights Labor’s failed immigration stance   

  Another boat carrying 52 asylum seekers, intercepted today near the Ashmore Islands, will be taken  to Christmas Island where the detention centre is already bursting at the seams,  Dr Sharman Stone,  Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, said today.   

 This brings the number of asylum seekers to 1293 since August last year when the Rudd Government  softened its immigration policy opening the back door for people smugglers.    

 How many more boats will we see before the Rudd Government admits its weakened border  protection measures have failed?   

 Mr Rudd and Senator Evans must stand before the Australian people and admit they are losing the  battle against people smugglers.    

 Again, I strongly urge the Rudd Government to launch an independent inquiry into the relationship  between its softened stance on immigration management and the surge of people smuggled into  Australia over the last 12 months.    

 Last week the Government admitted it has been forced to ship in portables to the Christmas Island  detention centre in a desperate and panicked measure to provide more beds for the exploding  population of unauthorised arrivals.   

 With the interception of another boat they will need to keep the portables coming but that seems  like lining the ambulances up at the bottom of the cliff.   

 There will always be push factors across the world, but what we don’t need is the foot on the  accelerator through a unique set of pull factors created by this Government.   

 Meanwhile lives are at risk and international criminals grow fat on the profits and Australia’s limited  humanitarian and refugee resources are diverted to deal with the smugglers whose clients have the  cash and contacts to go to the head of the queue.
