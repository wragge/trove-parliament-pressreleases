 Media Release   

 Safety needs to be ensured before refugees  returned   

 The Australian Greens want to know what monitoring is in place to make sure that refugees who are  returned to their home countries by the Australian Government are kept safe.   

 “When the Australian Government is offering vulnerable people over $3,000 to return home, we  should know what oversight is in place to make sure that they are safe when they go back to the  countries from which they fled,” Greens immigration spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young says.   

 “In becoming a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention Australia committed to protecting refugees  by not sending them back to places where they are at risk of human rights violations.   

 “NGOs such as Amnesty International have reported that serious human rights breaches still occur in  Sri Lanka so it is critical that the Australian Government has taken every precaution not to return  anyone to further persecution.   

 “I will be asking the Department of Immigration in the coming Estimates what independent advice  these people were given about their options for applying for asylum.   

 “The Australian Greens fear a lack of oversight will leave these people open to discrimination and set  a dangerous precedent for the future.”
