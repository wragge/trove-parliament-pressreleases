 NEW APPOINTMENTS TO ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL

  

 I am pleased to announce the appointment of 53 members of the Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), comprising 15 new members and 38 reappointed members. Most of the appointments will commence from 1 July, for terms of between one and three years.

 The appointments follow an extensive selection exercise. Appointments have been made at the Deputy President, Senior Member and Member level. To allow the AAT to flexibly manage its workload, many of the appointments have been made on a part-time basis.

 These appointments achieve a good balance of gender, mix of skills and background and location of members across Australia. I am confident that the quality of the AAT members appointed will ensure the effective continuity of the AAT, pending the establishment of the Administrative Review Tribunal.

 A list of the appointed members is attached.
