 Media Release: Denial of medical care allegations demand urgent action 

 5 September, 2016 

 Allegations that the Government has denied medical care to a family of asylum seekers,  including a 12-year-old with a badly broken arm, are extremely serious and demand urgent  action, Greens Immigration spokesperson Nick McKim says.   

 “It’s time that Minister Dutton take seriously his responsibility to care for the men, women and  especially children seeking asylum in Australia,” Senator McKim said.   

 “Unfortunately, this Government has a shameful record of denying medical care to people in  need, or dragging its feet rather than doing the right thing.”   

 “We know that the situation on Manus Island and Nauru is untenable. The very least the  Government can do is treat people seeking asylum with humanity.”   

 “The best way to resolve these issues is to close the camps and bring the detainees to  Australia.”
