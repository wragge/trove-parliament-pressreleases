 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling JULIA GILLARD HITS 3,000 ILLEGAL  ARRIVALS BY BOAT IN APRIL April 29, 2013

 The illegal arrival of another boat, with 74 people on board, has taken to over 3,000 the number of people to have illegally  arrived on boats so far this month, the first time more than 3,000 people have ever arrived in a single month, Shadow  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection,  Michael Keenan said today.

 “Another new record of failure has been achieved by Julia Gillard as she becomes the first Prime Minister ever to have  presided over the illegal arrival of over 3,000 people by boat in a single month,” Mr Morrison said.

 “Boat arrivals for this month are now more than triple what they were in April last year when 971 people arrived. These  continued record arrivals will result in yet more cost blow outs in the budget when the latest bill for Labor’s failed border  protection policies is presented to taxpayers.

 “If Australians were wondering where all the money for education funding or the National Insurance Disability Scheme has  gone they need only look off our north west coast where illegal boats continue to arrive at a rate of more than one a day  under Labor’s continued border protection chaos,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “650 boats since Labor came to office in 2007, another record. When Julia Gillard knifed Kevin Rudd she  identified this area of policy as one where the government had lost its way. Under Julia Gillard there has been an increase  in the amount of boats per month of greater than 300 percent. 

 “There is too much incentive in getting on a boat and risking your life under this government. 

 “There is a proven way to stop the boats. Sadly, only a change of government will achieve this,” Mr Keenan said.
