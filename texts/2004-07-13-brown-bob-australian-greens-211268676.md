 TPV decision welcome but government  needs to do more 

 The federal government's decision to allow thousands of temporary  protection visa holders to apply for permanent residency is welcome  but doesn't go far enough, Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.   

 "The government's reversal of its hardline stance on these refugees is  a small win for compassion but it falls well short of what is needed,"  Senator Brown said.   

 "The Greens have consistently argued that we do not need TPVs. This  visa class keeps in limbo people assessed as needing protection. It  restricts their access to education services, and denies them the right  to work and to bring family members to live with them.   

 "Senator Vanstone says the government's decision to allow 9,500 TPV  holders to apply for permanent residency does not undermine the  government's border security policy.   

 "There is no reason, then, for continuing the TPV class. The  government and the Labor Party should move immediately to support  the Greens long-held policy that everyone assessed as being a refugee  should be offered permanent residency.   

 "We also call on the government to issue a timetable to ensure that  the cases of the refugees are finalised as quickly as possible and to  ensure that this decision extends to TPV holders denied access to  permanent residency under legislation changes of September 2001.   

 "Restriction on their rights should be removed, allowing them to  become fully participating members of their new Australian home."
