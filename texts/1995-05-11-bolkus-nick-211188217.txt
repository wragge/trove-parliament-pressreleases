  HUMANITARIAN PROGRAM MAINTAINED AT 13,000 PLACES IN 1995/96 

  Australia will maintain its commitment to people across the world in urgent need of  resettlement with a Humanitarian Program of 13,000 places for 1995/96, the Minister for  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus, announced today. 

  "Once again, the program will reflect the desire of the Government and the Australian  community to make a positive contribution to those people who have suffered persecution,  . discrimination or displacement from their homes by offering them a new life in Australia." 

  The program will comprise: 

  4,000 places for refugees (people who meet the United Nations Convention definition  of a refugee); 

  5 ,200 places in the Special Assistance Category (for those in vulnerable positions  overseas who have close links with Australia) and 

  3,800 places in the Special Humanitarian Category (for people who have suffered  discrimination or other violation of human rights but are not defined as refugees). 

  The Humanitarian Program excludes those people assessed as refugees within Australia and  granted permanent residence. 

  "While Australia accepts refugees and other people in need from across the world, the  Government recognises that there are currently two priority areas -people displaced by the  wars in the former Yugoslavia region, and the Gulf," Senator Bolkus said. 

  "For many of the 3.5 million displaced in the former Yugoslavia region, resettlement remains  the only solution. They will be be allocated a sizeable proportion of the program, joining  the 11 ,000 other former Yugolsavs who have resettled in Australia since early 1992. In the  Middle East, some 22,500 people, mainly Iraqis, remain in need of resettlement as a result  of the Gulf War. I intend to continue our strong efforts to assist them." 

  Senator Bolkus said that the resettlement of Vietnamese asylum seekers from camps in South  East Asia and Hong Kong under the Comprehensive Plan of Action was nearing finalisation.  Australia has played a key role in the CPA for the past six years and has resettled more than  17 ,000 Vietnamese refugees in that time. 

  "However the program will remain flexible, so that Australia will be able to accommodate  further refugees who may need resettlement here under the CPA in 1995/96," he said. 

  Senator Bolkus said he planned to continue the eXlstmg programs under the Special  Assistance Category for Minorities from the former Soviet Union, people from the former  Yugoslavia, Sudanese, Burmese, East Timorese, Sri Lankans and Cambodians. 

  "The plight of women and children caught up in conflicts in Europe, Africa and the Middle  East is a continuing cause for concern," he said. 

  "Australia is one of the few countries to have addressed this issue, through its Woman at  Risk program. 

  "Special emphasis should be given to this group, and I intend to maintain, at 500, the number  of places allocated for Woman at Risk cases," he said.
