 Lennon’s Forest Vandalism Ploy Will Distract Police and Annoy Tasmanian Public

 Crean to receive Lennon complaint

 Tasmanian forests minister Paul Lennon’s naming of Peg Putt and myself in connection with logging machinery sabotage is despicable and will distract the police trying to find the culprit, Greens Senator Bob Brown said in Launceston today.

 “Mr Lennon should apologise to us both and the wider Tasmanian public,” Senator Brown said.

 “This is the Bacon ALP Government using the children overboard ploy. Pick a contentious issue involving a respected security force and a fearful public and falsely vilify an innocent victim by inference or assertion.

 “Paul Lennon’s assertion that ‘we don’t want these types of people here…we want them out of the place’ is a slight on myself and Peg Putt and is almost word for word John Howard’s vilification of the asylum seekers before the federal election. Premier Bacon’s silence is deafening.

 Senator Brown said Mr Lennon should follow his own line of logic and as a key politician in the forests debate, open his diary to the public and police and detail his knowledge of tensions in the logging industry where he has intimate connections.

 “However the fact is that neither he nor Peg nor Jim nor I know who is responsible or we would say so.

 Senator Brown noted that in Victoria of twelve recent episodes of logging vandalism the culprits have been identified in six cases and all were in the logging industry itself.

 “I expect to meet Simon Crean next month and will ask him take my complaint re Paul Lennon’s behaviour to the ALP national council.

 Senator Brown has written to the Police Commissioner asking for the $100 000 reward to extend to anyone helping identify the vandals who gelignited environmentalist’s cars at the Picton River and who placed a ‘bomb’, falsely implicating greens, on the railway before Black River two days before the 1993 federal election.
