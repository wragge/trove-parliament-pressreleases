 ADDRESS BY THE MINISTER FOR FINANCE, SENATOR PETER WALSH 

 AT A PUBLIC AFFAIRS LUNCHEON HOSTED BY 

 THE VICTORIAN CREDIT CO-OPERATIVE ASSOCIATION 

 MELBOURNE, FRIDAY/ 10 OCTOBER 1987

 Thank you for i n v i t i n g  me t o s p e a k  to you her e t o d a y .

 Le t me say a t t h e o u t s e t  t h a t I am a f i r m  s u p p o r t e r  of t h e

 CO-OPERATIVE APPROACH AS A "THIRD FORCE" IN OUR TYPE OF ECONOMY.

 Ther e i s a p l a c e for t h e p r o v i s i o n  of goods and s e r v i c e s  by

 COMMERCIAL PROFIT-SEEKING PRIVATE ENTERPRISE. THERE IS A PLACE  

 -  THOUGH SOME WOULD SEEK TO DENY I T  -  FOR THE PROVISION OF  

 SERVICES BY GOVERNMENT-OWNED AND CONTROLLED ORGANISATIONS. AND  

 THERE IS A PLACE FOR THE "THIRD FORCE" -  NON-PROFIT BODIES  

 ORGANISED ACCORDING TO PRINCIPLES OF CO-OPERATION AND MUTUAL  

 ENDEAVOUR.

 Bu t i t  i s one t h i n g  t o a s s e r t  t h a t t h e r e i s a p l a c e  i n t h e 

 Au s t r a l i a n  economy  for c o- o p e r a t i v e s . I t i s a n o t h e r  t o s a y

 WHERE THAT PLACE IS AND WHERE I T  IS  NOT.

 Some p e o p l e , as you w i l l  know , argue  t h a t  t h a t  p l a c e  i s  not

 IN THE SO-CALLED "DEREGULATED" FINANCIAL MARKETS OF- AUSTRALIA  

 IN THE LATE 1980S AND BEYOND.

 Ac c o r d i n g  to t h a t  v i e w , c r e d i t  u n i o n s  w i l l  only  be a b l e  to

 SURVIVE AS SEPARATE E N T IT IE S , BY MIMICKING THE BEHAVIOUR OF  

 THEIR PROFIT-ORIENTED COMPETITORS.

 Th i s  t h e n  i s  t h e  theme  I want t o e x p l o r e  w i t h  you t h i s  

 a f t e r n o o n : Can the co- o p e r a t i v e  s p i r i t  s u r v i v e  i n  the modern

 FINANCIAL ARENA? CAN CREDIT UNIONS SURVIVE WITHOUT LOSING THE  

 ESSENCE OF WHAT MAKES THEM DISTIN C TIVE?

 Al l of you i n  t h i s  room w i l l  be well  aware  t h a t  c r e d i t

 UNIONS HAVE BEEN FACING EXTREMELY TOUGH COMPETITION IN THEIR  

 OWN TRADITIONAL MARKETS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS OR SO.

 And you h a r d l y  need  me to t e l l  you t h a t  t h i n g s  are g o in g  to

 CONTINUE TO GET TOUGHER.

 De r e g u l a t i o n  i n  the b a n k in g  ar ea  has meant  t h a t  the

 ESTABLISHED BANKS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BID HIGHER RATES OF RETURN  

 ON DEPOSITS. M any of the new e n t r i e s  t o t h e b a n k in g  arena  have  

 BEEN OUT THERE BIDDING FOR THE ORDINARY HOUSEHOLD'S SAVINGS,  

 ALSO.

 De r e g u l a t o r y  moves  i n  the b u i l d i n g  s o c i e t i e s  area  have  seen

 NEW PLAYERS OFFERING HOUSEHOLDS THE TRADITIONAL FORM OF  

 PERSONAL LOAN.

 And as banks  and b u i l d i n g  s o c i e t i e s  h ave  so ug ht  to in c r e a s e

 THEIR SHARE OF THE PERSONAL LOAN MARKET, WE HAVE SEEN THE  

 DEVELOPMENT OF THE "EQUITY LOAN" -  THE LOAN WHICH RIDES ON THE  

 BACK OF THE SECURITY THE LENDER HOLDS THROUGH THE BORROWER'S  

 PRE-EXISTING HOUSING LOAN.

 Wi t h  Cr e d i t  Un i o n s  h a v i n g  a much sm a l l e r  p o r t f o l i o  of

 OUTSTANDING HOUSING MORTGAGE LOANS TO MAKE USE OF IN THIS WAY,

 -  I T  IS EASY TO SEE THAT THIS DEVELOPMENT RAISES THE SPECTRE OF  

 THE "HIGHEST QUALITY" PERSONAL LENDING (BY WHICH I MEAN THE  

 MOST SECURE LENDING) BEING SYPHONED AWAY FROM THE CREDIT UNION  

 SECTOR.

 At the same t i m e  as c o m p e t i t i o n  has b ee n  s q u e e z i n g  the

 MARGIN BETWEEN BORROWING AND LENDING INTEREST RATES, CREDIT  

 UNIONS HAVE HAD TO BE CONSCIOUS OF THEIR NEED TO BOLSTER THEIR  

 CAPITAL BASES.

 I t i s  a f a c t  of l i f e  t h a t  a person  d e p o s i t i n g  money  w i t h  a

 TRADING BANK ENJOYS A GREATER DEGREE OF SECURITY REGARDING THAT  

 DEPOSIT THAN IF  HE (OR SHE) HAD PLACED IT  WITH AN INSTITUTION  

 WHICH DOES NOT HAVE THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA STANDING

 BEHIND IT  -  EXERCISING PRUDENTIAL OVERSIGHT, AND OFFERING  

 "LENDER OF LAST RESORT" F A C IL IT IE S  -  SHOULD THE WORSE COME TO  

 THE WORSE.

 No n- bank f i n a n c i a l  e n t e r p r i s e s  can en h a n c e  th e s e c u r i t y

 WHICH THEY ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THEIR DEPOSITORS BY BOOSTING  

 THEIR CAPITAL-TO-LENDING RATIOS, AND BY WORKING TO IMPROVE THE  

 ARRANGEMENTS FOR PRUDENTIAL OVERSIGHT, AND LENDER OF LAST  

 RESORT F A C I L I T I E S ,  WHICH THEY THEMSELVES WORK UNDER.

 Here I t h i n k  V i c t o r i a ' s c r e d i t  u n i o n  m ovement  can g i v e

 ITSELF A WELL-MERITED PAT ON THE BACK. TO BOLSTER ITS CAPITAL  

 BASE, A CREDIT UNION MUST BUILD UP ITS RESERVES. THESE  

 RESERVES ARE THEMSELVES THE FRUITS OF THE SURPLUS OF THE  

 INTEREST MARGIN RECEIVED OVER AVERAGE OPERATING EXPENSES  

 INCURRED -  IE THE TRADING SURPLUS.

 I n s p i t e  of t h e tough  c o m p e t i t i v e  p r e s s u r e  on i n t e r e s t

 MARGINS, I UNDERSTAND THAT VICTO RIA'S CREDIT UNIONS HAVE  

 SUCCEEDED IN L IF T IN G  THEIR RESERVES TO LENDING RATIO FROM  

 AROUND 2%  TO AROUND 4% IN ONLY TWO YEARS. THIS HAS TO BE  

 RECOGNISED AS A MASSIVE ACHIEVEMENT.

 Toge the r  w i t h  t h e e f f i c i e n c y  and p r o f e s s i o n a l i s m  w i t h  w h ic h

 TRADING SURPLUSES SO AS TO IMPROVE FURTHER YOUR GEARING, AND TO  

 PERMIT EXPANDED LENDING.

 TO A LARGE EXTENT IT IS NOT WITHIN YOUR POWER TO WIDEN YOUR  

 INTEREST MARGINS. WHAT IS WITHIN YOUR POWER IS TO REDUCE YOUR  

 NET OPERATING EXPENSES.

 Th i s  i s  the key c h a l l e n g e  you f a c e . Can you pare  back  your

 NET OPERATING EXPENSE RATIOS, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY REMAINING  

 LOYAL TO YOUR PHILOSOPHICAL ROOTS? CAN YOU CONTINUE TO DO  

 T H IS , IN THE FACE OF CONTINUED OUTSIDE COMPETITION?

 Apart  from  m a t t e r s  of pure  a d m i n i s t r a t i v e  e f f i c i e n c y , t h i s

 RAISES A NUMBER OF OTHER IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.

 Fi r s t l y , t h e r e  i s  the m atter  of t h e p r o v i s i o n  of

 PAYMENTS-TYPE SERVICES AND THE LEVYING OF SEPARATE CHARGES FOR  

 SUCH SERVICES.

 MIGHT ALIENATE SOME OF THE MORE TRADITIONALLY-MINDED BANK

 CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN SPECTACULARLY H IG H -A C T IV IT Y  

 LOW-ACCOUNT-BALANCE DEPOSITORS; IT  HAS TO BE ACCEPTED THAT TWO  

 IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES WILL FOLLOW FROM THIS MOVE.

 . Banks  w i l l  g e t more of t h e i r  pa y m e n t s  s e r v i c e  c o s t s  covered

 E XPLICITLY AND AWAY FROM NEEDING TO BE COVERED OUT OF THE  

 INTEREST MARGIN BETWEEN DEPOSIT AND LOAN RATES.

 I f Cr e d i t  Un i o n s  s t i c k  to e x i s t i n g  p r a c t i c e s , t h e y  w i l l

 FIND THEMSELVES PICKING UP NEW CUSTOMERS IN THE FORM OF  

 H IG H -A C T IV IT Y  LEVEL, LOW-ACCOUNT BALANCE REFUGEES FROM THE  

 BANKS.

 En r o l l i n g  new cu stom er s  i s  a t t r a c t i v e . Bu t t h e s e  customers

 WOULD BE LIKELY TO PUSH NET OPERATING EXPENSE RATIOS UPWARDS -  

 AT THE SAME TIME AS THE IMPOSITION OF THE NEW CHARGES WAS  

 PERMITTING THE BANKS TO ACT TO SQUEEZE MARKET INTEREST MARGINS  

 FURTHER.

 Cr e d i t  Un i o n  d i r e c t o r s  and a d m i n i s t r a t o r s  m ust  then  ask

 THEMSELVES THE QUESTION: IS IT AN INHERENT PART OF THE

 "FUNDAMENTAL ETHOS" OF CREDIT UNIONS TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL  

 VOLUMES OF PAYMENTS SERVICES TO PERSONS WHO ARE NEITHER  

 SIGNFICANT LENDERS TO NOR BORROWERS FROM THE RELEVANT BODIES?

 Or i s  t h e " f u n d a m e n t a l  e t h o s " of Cr e d i t  Un i o n s  more a

 MATTER OF ACCEPTING MEMBERS' SAVINGS AND EXTENDING LOANS TO  

 MEMBERS AT INTEREST RATES WHICH ARE AS HIGH ON THE FORMER AND  

 AS LOW ON THE LATTER AS IS CONSISTENT WITH ACCEPTED PRINCIPLES  

 OF EQUITY AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF FINANCIAL PRUDENCE?

 I THINK FROM THE WAY I HAVE PHRASED THOSE QUESTIONS, I T  

 WILL BE CLEAR WHICH SIDE OF THE FENCE I AM INCLINED TO LEAN TO.

 Se c o n d l y , t h e r e  i s  t h e m a t t e r  of "c o r p o r a t e  l e n d i n g " -  o r,

 MORE PRECISELY, THE MAKING BY CREDIT UNIONS OF SIZEABLE  

 BUSINESS LOANS TO CORPORATE E N T I T I E S .

 The a d m i n i s t r a t i v e  c o s t s a s s o c i a t e d  w i t h  m a k i n g  an i n t e r e s t

 ONLY LOAN OF $2 M IL L IO N  TO A SINGLE BORROWER, ARE CLEARLY WAY  

 BELOW THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RUNNING A  

 THOUSAND SEPARATE STANDARD PERSONAL LOAN CONTRACTS, WITH THE  

 SAME AGGREGATE LOAN VALUE.

 To g e t h e r , I s u s p e c t , w i t h  t h e glamour  of p a r t i c i p a t i n g  i n

 THE SAME GAME AS THE "BIG BOYS" PLAY, THIS FACT APPEARS TO HAVE  

 ATTRACTED SOME CREDIT UNION DIRECTORS AND ADMINISTRATORS INTO  

 ADVOCATING THAT CREDIT UNIONS SHOULD MOVE INTO "CORPORATE  

 LENDING".

 The r e c e n t  e v e n t s  i n my own St a t e su g g est  t h a t t h e r e  i s a

 CATCH TO T H I S .  I UNDERSTAND THAT THE SMALLER SCALE AND LESS  

 PUBLICISED A C T I V I T I E S  OF ONE VICTORIAN CREDIT UNION NOT SO LONG

 0 U1875

 8.

 AGO, TOGETHER WITH THE PROMPT ACTIONS OF YOUR RESERVE BOARD IN  

 RESPONSE TO THAT SITUATION, HAVE MEANT THAT ENTHUSIASM FOR THE  

 "CORPORATE LENDING" STRATEGY HERE IN VICTORIA WAS SLIGHT, EVEN  

 BEFORE THOSE RECENT EVENTS IN PERTH.

 Le t me n e v e r t h e l e s s  make some comments  on the s u b j e c t .

 The t y p i c a l  Cr e d i t  Un i o n  has g r e a t e r  e x p e r t i s e  a t i t s

 DISPOSAL FOR ASSESSING THE RISKS ATTACHING TO PERSONAL LOANS TO  

 ITS MEMBERS THAN I T  HAS FOR ASSESSING THE RISKS ATTACHING TO  

 SIZEABLE BUSINESS LOANS TO CORPORATE E N TITIES .

 I t has l i m i t e d  e x p e r t i s e  at i t s  d i s p o s a l  for p u t t i n g

 TOGETHER THE PROPER DOCUMENTATION APPROPRIATE TO THE LATTER  

 TYPE OF LOAN.

 I t lacks  t h e  sc a le  of a c t i v i t y  and dep th  of p o r t f o l i o  w h i c h .

 WOULD ALLOW IT  TO TAKE IN ITS STRIDE A SINGLE SUBSTANTIAL  

 DEFAULT ON A LOAN OF THIS LATTER TYPE.

 These  are t h r e e  good reasons  why Cr e d i t  Un i o n s  sh ou ld  l e a v e

 THAT TYPE OF BUSINESS TO OTHER TYPES OF FINANCIAL  

 INSTITUTIONS. BUT THERE IS A FOURTH AND ARGUABLY MOST  

 IMPORTANT REASON.

 IS IT  COMPATIBLE WITH THE "FUNDAMENT ETHOS" OF CREDIT .

 Un i o n s  t o gather  t o g e t h e r  the funds  of many  small  s a v er s

 PERHAPS ATTRACTED TO CREDIT UNIONS BY THE CO-OPERATIVE ETHOS,

 IN ORDER TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL LOANS TO PROFIT-ORIENTED CORPORATE  

 ENTERPRISES, WITH.THE INTEREST RATES CHARGED ON THE LATTER  

 BEING, LOWER, IN ALL PROBABILITY, THAN THE LENDING RATES THE

 Cr e d i t  Un i o n  charges  to i t s  own o r d in a r y  m em bers ?

 There  are p u r i s t s , I i m a g i n e , who would  argue  t h a t  Cr e d i t  

 Un i o n s  should  st e er  c l e a r  of m a k in g  loans  for any b u s i n e s s  

 p u r p o s e . That i s  a m a t t e r  for you to d e b a t e . Bu t i t  does

 STRIKE ME THAT A DISTINCTION CAN BE MADE BETWEEN:

 . On t h e one h a n d : m a k i n g .a loan  to a normal  m e m b e r , who

 HAPPENS TO BE A SELF-EMPLOYED PERSON, AND WHO REQUIRES A  

 LOAN TO PURSUE WHAT AMOUNTS TO THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND THAT OF  

 THEIR FAMILY -  A LOAN MOREOVER OF A SIZE NOT OUT OF LINE  

 WITH WHAT THAT CREDIT UNION IS WILLING TO EXTEND TO A  

 MEMBER FOR PERSONAL PURPOSES, AND WHERE THERE IS A  

 REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT THE MEMBER WILL EVENTUALLY  

 BECOME A NET DEPOSITOR.

 Tu r n i n g  to t h e t h i r d  i s s u e  I w i s h  t o r a i s e : t h i s  i s , I

 BELIEVE, THE MOST CONTENTIOUS. IT IS THE MATTER OF HOW YOU  

 RESPOND TO THE INCIDENCE OF BAD DEBTS EXPERIENCED IN LENDING  

 FOR DEBT CONSOLIDATION AND FOR CURRENT L IV IN G  EXPENSES.

 He r e , i t  s t r i k e s  m e , you fa ce  a r ea l  c o n f l i c t  b e t w e e n  your

 TRADITIONAL PHILOSOPHY OF HELPING PEOPLE KEEP OUT OF THE  

 CLUTCHES OF USUROUS MONEY-LENDERS NOW, AND YOUR DUTY TO ATTEMPT  

 TO SURVIVE AS CREDIT UNIONS -  TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE  

 THE COMMUNITY WITH YOUR SOCIALLY VALUABLE SERVICES INTO THE  

 FUTURE.

 I t  IS A FACT OF L IF E  THAT, VIEWED AS A WHOLE, LENDING FOR  

 DEBT CONSOLIDATION AND FOR CURRENT LIVIN G EXPENSES PURPOSES ARE  

 AREAS WITH A HIGH INCIDENCE OF DELINQUENCY AND OF OTHER FORMS  

 OF BAD DEBT.

 IT  IS THUS A HIGH COST AREA. ONE POSSIBLE RESPONSE TO YOUR  

 NEED TO PARE BACK YOUR OPERATING EXPENSE RATIOS WOULD BE TO  

 TAKE THE AXE TO THOSE TYPES OF LENDING -  TO CONFINE YOURSELVES  

 TO THE "BETTER QUALITY" AREAS OF LENDING -  WHERE COSTS OF RISK  

 ASSESSMENT ARE LOW, AND THE COSTS OF FINANCIAL COUNSELLING ZERO.

 Th a t , I f e e l , would  be t h r o w in g  out the baby  w i t h  t h e

 BATHWATER.

 Bu t t h i s  i s  an a r e a  where  you must  do s o m e t h in g  t o reduce

 YOUR EXPENSE RATIOS. AND THERE IS CLEARLY A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  

 DEBT CONSOLIDATION AND "BAD-DEBT" CONSOLIDATION. I T  IS ONE  

 THING GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THE CLUTCHES OF THE USURERS, IT  IS  

 QUITE ANOTHER TO SIMPLY TAKE OVER THE USURERS' BAD DEBTS. THE  

 PROBLEM IS :  SPOTTING THAT DIFFERENCE IN PRACTICE, AND THEN

 TRYING TO MAKE SURE I T  WORKS OUT THAT WAY.

 YOU MUST REDUCE YOUR OPERATING EXPENSE RATIOS. AND THAT MEANS  

 BECOMING LEANER, AND MORE PROFESSIONAL IN GOING ABOUT YOUR  

 BUSINESS. IT  MEANS PAYING CLOSER ATTENTION TO YOUR COSTS OF  

 BAD DEBTS.

 I HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF DISCUSSIONS WITH NEIL O'KEEFE ABOUT  

 THESE ISSUES. HE SHARES MY VIEWS. HE BELIEVES THAT YOUR  

 RECENT MOVES TO SATISFY THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT THAT YOU ARE  

 "DIFFERENT" -  THAT YOU INTEND TO FOCUS ON YOUR "COMMON BONDS"

 AS THE KEY TO REACHING A "Q UALITY" BASE IS THE ANSWER.

 I AGREE AND ENCOURAGE YOU IN THAT DIRECTION.

 I n t h e f i n a l  u p s h o t  you are n o t g o i n g  to be a b le TO SUSTAIN
