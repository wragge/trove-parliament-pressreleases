 Continued attack on Triggs proves no lessons learned    

 Greens Leader Christine Milne says the extraordinary but predictable new attack on Gillian  Triggs has again shown the Coalition is more concerned with witch hunts than leadership and  good policy.    

 “Claims against Gillian Triggs from anonymous Coalition sources in the Murdoch pamphlet are  laughable in the face of evidence presented to the Senate this week,” Senator Milne said.    

 “So much for turning over a new leaf. The Coalition’s only response to the cruelty uncovered  against refugee children has been bullying and cowardly anonymous attacks.    

 “Offshore detention centres should be closed. They are certainly no place for children.    

 “Gillian Triggs is an outstanding advocate for human rights and for common decency in  Australia. She has been bullied, ever since Tony Abbott came to office, by his team of small  men full of moral cowardice.    

 “Instead of having the courage to answer the criticisms, they are trying to shoot the messenger.    

 “I’d take the evidence Gillian Triggs presented to Senate Estimates over the government’s  anonymous sources any day.”
