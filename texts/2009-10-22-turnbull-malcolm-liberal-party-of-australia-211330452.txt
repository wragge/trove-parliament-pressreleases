 Turnbull Doorstop - Border protection and asylum seekers 

 The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP   Leader of the Opposition 

 E&OE  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well on the day that another unauthorised arrival is picked up just off Christmas Island, the  Prime Minister in an outburst of contrived indignation seeks to distract attention from the  comprehensive failure of his border protection policies. It is the stated objective of every  Australian government, the previous government and this Government to stop the scourge of  people smuggling and, as far as practicable, ensure that there are no unauthorised arrivals of  asylum seekers into Australian waters. That is the policy objective of the Government. This  Government’s policy has comprehensively failed - since the changes in August last year, 43  boats and over 2000 unauthorised arrivals.  

 Now when Julia Gillard was Shadow Immigration Minister, she said ‘another boat, another  policy failure’. So we now have by the Labor Party’s own yardstick, 43 policy failures. This  has been a catastrophic failure in government policy and Mr Rudd has to address it and what  he has sought to do today is to distract attention from his failure by this contrived, this bogus  outburst of hysteria and indignation.  

 QUESTION:  

 Do you agree with Mr Tuckey?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 I saw Mr Tuckey’s remarks. I spoke to Mr Tuckey and I note that he has issued a clarifying  statement about them.  

 QUESTION:  

 Aren't you just another Liberal… beleaguered Liberal Party leader out there - this is what  Kevin Rudd says - out there…  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 I was about to say, you are normally more eloquent than that.  

 QUESTION:  

 Out there whacking the asylum card - is what he said - because there’s political gain in it and  you should show some leadership and control this debate he says.  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well I urge every member of this Parliament to speak about this very important issue in calm  and measured and rational language just as I did in the House earlier this week in the MPI.  And I notice the Attorney-General thanked me for the way in which I approached the issue.  And I intend to do that. I will make no criticisms of asylum seekers. I recognise that they  come, many of them, from the most desperate situations and that there are million of refugees  around the world desperately seeking asylum somewhere.  

 I also recognise that Australia’s borders have to be secure. We have a generous humanitarian  program, a very generous one and we should uphold the integrity of our borders and act  generously in accordance with our obligations under the United Nations Convention on  Refugees.  

 QUESTION:  

 But what would you actually do that’s different?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well what I would do is not have a policy that has comprehensively failed. You see, the  problem with Mr Rudd in his approach… I mean his attempt to distract today is just another  stunt in his efforts to avoid the real issue. You see he has as his objective the same that Mr  Howard had, which is to stop people smuggling and stop boats arriving. Now Mr Howard’s  policies succeeded. Mr Rudd said they were no good, he removed them and since then we  have had a surge of boat arrivals. And I go back…  

 QUESTION:  

 [inaudible]  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 This issue is for Mr Rudd. It is his policy that has failed. He is the Prime Minister of  Australia. He is the one that is using hysterical language, extraordinary language to try to  distract attention from a policy failure. If you accept…  

 QUESTION:  

 [Inaudible]  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 I beg your pardon?  

 QUESTION:  

 Wilson Tuckey is using hysterical language too by the same token.  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Wilson Tuckey is not the Prime Minister of Australia. Mr Rudd should approach this issue  calmly and objectively.  

 Now according to Mr Rudd, there are no pull factors associated with this surge. In other  words, Australian domestic policy - that is to say, the policies of the Australian Government  - have no influence on the number of unauthorised arrivals. That flies in the face of all of the  evidence, all of the facts, numerous reports from around the world. Mr Rudd’s policy has no  credibility.  

 QUESTION:  

 What would you do?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 What we will do when we return to government is ensure that our borders are secure. That  will be our commitment.  

 Mr Rudd is the Prime Minister at the moment whose stated objective is to stop the vile surge  of people smuggling, as he describes it, but instead we are seeing a surge of an extraordinary  kind that has come immediately after - with growing intensity - he changed the policies and  sent a signal that Australia had become a soft target.  

 Thanks very much.
