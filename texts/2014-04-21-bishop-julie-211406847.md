 Foreign Affairs Minister 

 Julie Bishop 

 Australia provides $20 million for children affected by Syrian  crisis 

 Media release 

 21 April 2014 

 Today I am announcing that Australia will provide $20 million for children in  Lebanon and Jordan who have fled across borders as refugees due to the Syrian  crisis. 

 The funding will be provided to the United Nations’ ‘No Lost Generation’ initiative to  help build better futures for these children by improving their education and  addressing the violence and displacement they have faced. 

 Around half of the 2.7 million Syrian refugees are children, and around 70 per cent of  these children are not attending school.  Children are the most affected of the  fighting - an entire generation is being shaped by fear and violence and, often,  without an education. 

 Australia will coordinate its efforts with other nations to ensure these children can be  supported in the region so that they can return to their homes in Syria when the  crisis has stabilised.  

 Australia will provide $9 million to the Office of the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), $9 million to the United Nations Children’s  Fund (UNICEF) and $2 million to Save the Children Australia. 

 Australia has provided over $130 million to the humanitarian response to the Syrian  crisis since the conflict began in 2011.  An additional $2 million has been provided to  assist in the destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons. 

 The United Nations estimates 9.3 million people inside Syria are in need of  assistance making the Syrian conflict the greatest humanitarian, peace and security  crisis facing the world today. 

 Today’s announcement will help relieve the burden on neighbouring communities  sheltering Syrian refugees in this time of crisis.
