 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH SENATOR NICK BOLKUS,  ADELAIDE, 2.30PM, DECEMBER 30 1994.

 The message of today's announcement is a clear one. The  objective of today's announcement is to basically stop boat  arrivals coming into Australia,  and we expect that the  announcement of the measures in the package today will have a 

 substantial eff^t on the number of boats coming here.

 'the fact is that we want to send a very clear message to anyone  who is intending to come to Australia illeslly by boat with no  valid claim that the doors are closed. ^

 'They are not wanted here unless they have got a valid claim.

 Essentially you are not wanted here if you haven't got a valid  claim. Don't even bother trying.

 The measures announced today are a package of measures which go  very much to every aspect of this particular problem. The  legislative measures that have been announced are a raft of  measures which essentially toughen up in a whole diverse number 

 of ways our legislative processes for handling these sorts of  people.

 We are basically saying to people,  particularly those who have  received protection in other countries,  that we are going to  toughen up our legislation, legislation that denies those sorts  of people applying for protection here again.

 We are going to toughen up legislation which deals with repeat  applications and we are also going to toughen up legislation  that bounces out of the system claims that are manifestly  un just.

 â¢Those provisions will have effect from today's date.

 The legislation will be introduced in February,  but will have  effect from today's date.

 As well as that we will be legislating to ensure that people  can't claim refugee etauts in Australia on the basis of China's  one child policy.

 It's a policy which has lead to enormous problems in the United  States allowing people to claim asylum status on the basis of  that policy.

 t

 They won't be able to claim asylum status in Australia on the   basis of the one child policy.

 Now the measures as I say have effect from today and they cover   every applicatiorn for asylum status which is lodged after   today's a n n o u n c e m e n t .

 So basically those poeple who have come into Australia by boat   in recent days are covered by this raft of^easures that we will   be introducing into Parliament as soon as'Parliament resumes.

 As well as that the second part of our strategy has always been   to engage in discussion with the Chinese authorities. We will   continue to do that - in fact that team of senior officials   will be going to China next week to Beijing to discuss with the  

 Chinese authorities two particular aspects of our ongoing   discussions with t h e m .

 We have had some success in recent days with boats being   stopped out of China but we need to maximise t h a t , we need to   build on that, we need to esnure that the number of boats   leaving China is reduced even more so - as I say we have had  

 some s u c c e s s , the talks will go towards enhancing cooperation   of the Chinese authorities in that r e s p e c t . The talks will   also go towards progressing discussions we have had so far in   respect to organising the return of these people to China,   discussions have been constructive but there is some way to go   and the senior officials in Beijing will have as their second   p r i o r i t i y , as one of thi^br two p r i o r i t i e s , the continuing of  

 talks to ensure q u ick r e t u r n , speedy r e t u r n ,of the people that   we are talking a b o u t .

 The other apsect of t o d a y 's m e a s u r e s  is that obviously   detention is an important part of our r e s p o n s e . Detention has   been criticised In the past but I think the value of detention   can't be u n d e r e s t i m a t e d , We will be looking at alternatives to  

 Port Hedland to complement Port Hedland as a place because we   do anticipate that at least as a backstop we need to have   another venue in store.

 As well as that let me say that the Government's objective in   this area is o n e , to send the m e s s a g e ,and that message is we   choose the migrants we want. We choose the settlers we want to   come into Australia.

 That's either under our Migration Program or under our   Refugee/Humanitarian P r o g r a m . We take more refugees and   humanitarian cases per year than any other county in the world   on a per capita basis. We do so in accordance with  

 internationally accepted p r i n c i p l e s . and we do so in   cooperation with the UNHCR.

 We took 13000 this financial y e a r , we took 2,350 out of camps   in our region this financial y e a r . They are genuine reguees,   we will continue to do that. But we say to people who don't  have valid claims, 1  you are not welcome here 1.

 Q :  How can you be sure that these poeple will get the message?

 A: Well the message is going to get to them in a number of   ways,  One way is in cooperation with the authorities in  Beijing to ensure that people don't leave and we have had some   success there. The other message is through all sorts of 

 channels,  whether it's direct there or through their supporters   in Australia. And the message basically is, those legal avenues   that you might have had in the past are going to be closed off   now - don't waste your money.

 Q: What about boats already on the high seas, will they be   turned back or will be allowed to land?

 A: We mention in this press statement that there is a pipleline effect in terms of boats. We intend to substantially  decrease the number of boats but we expect that there might be   some other boats on the high seas coming here.  Those boats  will be processed in the normal way but the message to them is,   you won't have the chance if you come from the southern part of  

 China, if you are Sino-Vietnamese in background, if you have  received protection from China as all these people have in   cooperation with the UNHCR, you will not be able to claim  asylum here and basically you ought to think logout turning  back.

 Q: Has coastal surveillance been stepped up at all

 A: Coastal surveillance has been involved in discussions in recent days in respect to this and you have to remember that in  terms of the number of boats floating around in the north of  Australia there have been thousands over the past year or so, 

 there1ve been only two that have got through without being  spotted. We obviously want to maximise their return there as  well, but coastal surveillance has been involved in discussions  and I think they are happy with the attitude that we are 

 taking,  and the position that we have determined.

 Q: Have the Chinese authorities agreed to cooperate?.

 A: The Chinese authorities have in fact been cooperating substantially on a whole range of issues related to this. Their efforts in southern China to stop boats leaving - I  think we are getting more and more evidence of that - and in 

 terms of returns, we are having constructive discussions with  themâ  They haven't saic^they won't take them back - it's just  a matter of working out how and when they can take them back.

 conditions on the returnees? Q Have they put any

 A; Well with all returns you've got to work out the processes   and conditions and obviously the Chinese have got some concerns   that we need to take into account.

 The purpose of our people going over there next week is once   again to take those concerns into account and talk them over   with the Chinese .

 Don't forget also that we did send some£one to China,  the   second person in charge of the Immigration Department,  at the   end of November.  Those talks were constructive but obviously   they need to be kicked on a bit now.

 Q: There’s some evidence of a heavy handed approach of China’s on these people on the seas leaving, do you support that?

 A: I think the reality is that this has got to be stopped from   two ends,  if it’s to be stopped at all. You've got to have   measures within China,  to stop people leaving illegally, and   you've got to have measures in Australia to send them a message  

 to say that you are not welcome.

 And those measures taken in China are in accordance with those   priorities.  I haven't had any evidence of heavy handed   measures,  I have had evidence of people being arrested and   detained,  but you know if they breach Chinese law then they've  

 got to cop the consequences in the same way as they have to cop   the conseqences v%tn they come to Australia.

 Q :  One of the criticisms that the message isn't getting   through to China is due to the slowness of our processes here   because of the legislation .. the measure^ you are Introducing   in February, will that speed up the processing procedure at all   so that we will see the message getting back faster7

 A: This package of measures will give us the same processing capacity as ve do have for those boats who have come to   Australia from camps in our region,  Galang and others ... so it   does allow us a speedy process.  We do however have to get  

 agreement from the other side to ensure speedy acceptance and   that's the other part of our objective right now.

 Q :  Have you thought about travellfong over there yourself?

 A: Yes look I've had ongoing discussions with China's officials   here,  I have had on going discussions by phone over there and I   think Tim Fischer's statements deny the fact that we do have   telephones these days. Officials are in constant communication  

 on this.

 The reality is that we have had direct constant communication   with the Chinese authorities on this, both here and in   Austrlaia and if there was a need then obviously I'd consider   it, but our estimation now is that there's no need for me to go

 ' 94 1  2 ' 31  1 6 : 2 3

 over. There is a need to maintain these high level contacts   and I am in fact one phone call away and I have used the pohone   a number of times in the last 10 days.

 Q: 6o you see a point where y o u , might have to go over there?

 A: Not at this stage, no.

 I think the way the talks have been progressing and the   constructive approach that we are getting from the other side   means that there won't be a need for that.

 But there is a need for us to use that capacity of using the   phone and not only have I done that but I have also, and so has   the Foreign Minister, written to our counterparts in Beijing in   recent day s . We have had direct contact with them and through  

 the ambassador to them, so there's been more ways than one to   make direct contact with them, I suppose you can say you can   let your fingers do the walking.

 Q: ^What proportion of boat people in the past have been able   to claim refugee status who won't be able to from now on?

 A: I think when we're talking about this particular package of   measures we are talking very much as a primary target group of   Sino Vietnamese from out of the southern part of Ch i n a , but you   are also taking about anyone who wants to come here and claim  

 asylum status on the basis of China's one child policy. Now if   we were to let that policy stay intact - that capacity to stay   intact, you could probably find that the ... our process would   be out of control he r e . That's why we're taking this measure  

 now to ensure that we have measures in place to ensurre that   people dont access the one child policy as their reason for   asylum status.

 Q: What proportion of people won't be able to ...

 A: Essentially what I am trying to say to you that it's very   hard to put a proportion on it, that the message is fairly   clearly anyone from the southern part of China from the Beihei   province of Sino Vietmameae background will be covered by this  

 legislation, and also anyone seeking asylum status from China   will be covered by the part of the legislation which bounces   the one child policy as a leg for seeking asylum status, so I   think you are talking about, quite a substantial proportion of  

 those who are seeking asyli’um status from there.

 Q :  How quickly can you expect the latest boat people to be   processed?

 A: Well they are being processed effectively and quickly, we've   got huge resources up there at the moment and I'm in constant

 contact with the department,  oo in respect to that, people are  being processed but the reality is we have to ensure both the  porcessing in accordance with our law and ensure that there is  a ready acceptance at the other end.

 Those two things have to be progressed at the same time. That's a priority without a doubt.

 Q What is the latest indications of the numbers that are on  their way and how soon will they be here?

 A: There is no evidence at this stage of another boat on the  way. I say at this stage because the pipeline effect is that  it takes three or four weeks for a boat to get here from  southern China,  So there may in fact be some boats.  But 

 there's none on the horizon at this stage so we do expect that  we are not free of this for the time being,  but that's why we  are taking these measures and that's why we are also taking  steps to find back up support for Port Hedland.

 Q :  Do you think by this time next year the message will have well and truly got through or will it take many years?

 A: Well I think the message will get through very strongly to  the supporters of these people in Australia.

 And it won't take all that long before the message goes from  them to the southern part of China, it won11 be a year before  it gets there.

 Q :  How are you going with the progress for a backup to Port Hedland,  have we seen any movement there?

 A; I have said that we are looking at options for Port Hedland  - some are in WA but we need to look at all of them and what  venues have got the capacity for the people that we need and  the backup support.  It may very well be that we don't have to  use the back-up support.

 Q: Any one of these measures that stands out as the main one that is going to help stem the flow?

 A: Well I think the legislation effective from today's date  which will be introduced in a month's time, will have an aspect  of retrospectivity about it, but the message from that  legislation is that if you are from that part of China with no 

 valid claim,  then don't bother coming and I think that in  itself is the strongest message you could get,  As well as that  the meauere of people going over, senior officials going over,  to discuss with the Chinese authorities ways to maybe  strengthen their surveillance of boats leaving China will also  be very important.

 Q :  If coastal surveillance cornea across a boat say within 100km of Australia can it turn it around?

 A: There are all sorts of implications involved with that, both   practical, political and international implications. So we are   not talking at this stage of turning boats around. We are  talking of stopping it at its source.
