 SHAYNE NEUMANN MP 

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR   

 DUTTON FAILS REFUGEES ON MANUS AND NAURU AGAIN   

 Immigration officials have confirmed the Turnbull Government is not negotiating with  any other countries to resettle refugees currently living on Manus Island and Nauru.    

 Potentially hundreds of refugees on Manus Island and Nauru will miss out on the  opportunity to resettle in the United States and could be left to languish in Regional  Processing Centres for years to come.   

 Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has been sitting idly in the full knowledge that a  significant number of refugees will miss out on the US resettlement deal.    

 We now hear the Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has further shirked responsibility  and is not even engaging with any other countries to resettle genuine refugees from  Manus and Nauru.   

 Itâ€™s not good enough for Peter Dutton to put all his eggs in one basket.   

 Labor supports the US refugee resettlement agreement because of the need to get  people off Manus Island and Nauru and into permanent resettlement.    

 Peter Dutton should do his job and immediately secure other third country  resettlement options for refugees on Manus Island and Nauru.
