 Arrivals Flock to Tasmania

 Australia’s Apple Isle, Tasmania, has proven to be an attractive haven for migrant and refugee entrants, with the largest number under this  Coalition Government.

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, released the 2004-05 figures today, with more than  900 people arriving and settling in Tasmania.

 Senator Vanstone said this was an increase of almost 100 people compared to last year’s figure of 811 and meant Tasmanian arrivals had increased  nearly 60 per cent in the past 10 years, when just 552 settled in Tasmania.

 In 2004-05 the United Kingdom and New Zealand provided the largest number of Tasmania settlers, with Africa the third highest.

 On the national front, more than 123 000 people arrived and settled in Australia in 2004-05, up 40 per cent on the 1994-95 figures.

 ‘Australia has a wonderfully rich and diverse society as a result, with nearly one in four of Australia’s 20 million people born overseas,’ Senator  Vanstone said.

 ‘On top of these figures are the growing numbers of people becoming permanent residents after arriving in Australia, such as overseas students  who apply for skilled migration onshore.

 ‘Our ongoing commitment to new and innovative visa programs and the increased efficiency and integrity of immigration processing means that  Australia continues to attract more and more people from around the globe.’
