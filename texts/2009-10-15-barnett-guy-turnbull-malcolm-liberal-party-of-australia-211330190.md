 TURNBULL JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH BARNETT - WASTE ANNUAL  REPORT 2008/09, PUBLIC HOSPITALS, BORDER PROTECTION AND  ASYLUM SEEKERS 

 The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP  

 Leader of the Opposition 

 E&OE  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 We are here at Abbotsford with Senator Guy Barnett to launch the Labor Waste Annual Report. This is the 

 product of the Labor Waste committee that Guy Barnett chairs which keeps a very close eye on the growing 

 waste and mismanagement of the Rudd Labor Government. And this is a chronicle of waste, mismanagement 

 and inefficiency. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent on consultants; billions of dollars being wasted recklessly.  

 And of course we are here in Abbotsford where we have one of the sadly iconic examples of Labor’s waste and 

 mismanagement. This is the school where four perfectly serviceable classrooms are to be torn down at a cost of 

 $2.5 million and then replaced with four perfectly serviceable classrooms. $2.5 million of taxpayers’ money to tear 

 down four classrooms and build four classrooms - and that really is a symbol of the Labor Party’s attitude to 

 debt, to deficit, to borrowing, to spending; borrowing and spending big, spending ineffectively and throwing a 

 heavy burden on the shoulders of Australians now and in generations to come.  

 And we saw today in a speech by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, who has had to put up 

 interest rates - these interest rates are rising in part as a consequence of Labor’s reckless spending - we saw 

 Glenn Stevens say that economic policy has to be recalibrated as circumstances change. In other words, the 

 message to Mr Rudd and Mr Swan is: now that you can see the economy is much stronger than you thought it 

 was going to be when you committed to all this reckless spending, now is the time to wind it back.  

 But oh no, Mr Swan wants to keep on spending like there’s no tomorrow. No matter how much economic data 

 demonstrates that they should be winding back their reckless spending and borrowing, these Paris Hiltons of 

 government finance are determined to keep spending.  

 Guy?  

 SENATOR GUY BARNETT:  

 Thank you. Thank you Malcolm and today, yes, we’re releasing the annual report, it’s the first annual report of the 

 Labor Waste Committee. It’s highlighting the Labor waste, the litany of waste, the litany of reckless spending and 

 some of the key examples are set out in the report, and I just want to nominate a few.  

 But today we can advise that this Rudd Labor Government is spending more on consultants than any other 

 Australian Government in history - over $900 million since they were elected - and that’s outlined in the report.  

 We have had the GROCERYchoice website fiasco where Mr Rudd promised to put downward pressure on 

 grocery prices, and what did he do? He established a website and they budgeted for over $13 million over four 

 years and of course in less than 12 months they’ve expended, of taxpayers’ money, nearly $10 million.  

 The website was of no use to consumers or anybody else and has now been closed down. It is a shocking waste 

 of money.  

 The $1.7 million overspend in terms of school stimulus waste and $3.6 million, for example, on signs to promote 

 the Labor Party, to get them elected before the next election and memorial plaques to Julia Gillard. These are but 

 some of the examples. And as Mr Turnbull indicated, here we are at Abbotsford Primary School to highlight the 

 $2.5 million for four classrooms to be knocked down and to be rebuilt.  

 These are projects that are being forced on schools to undertake projects that they don’t want or in fact don’t 

 need. So there’s a whole range of litany of examples in the report and they highlight and confirm that the Labor 

 waste has now become systemic within the Rudd Labor Government. It is now systemic and today we have 

 relaunched the website: www.laborwaste.com and we are seeking further examples from members of the public, 

 consumers, small business people. To highlight the waste please go to: www.laborwaste.com.  

 We will scrutinise that feedback and we will keep this Government accountable for what they should be doing.  

 And at a time like this, at a time like this when it is difficult for a lot of people, we say we want to keep the 

 Government honest and accountable and to ensure scrutiny so that taxpayers get good value for money.  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Thank you. Do you have some questions?  

 QUESTION:  

 Mr Turnbull just following on from the AMA’s report yesterday, do you think it’s now time that the Commonwealth 

 took over public hospitals?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well it is time that Mr Rudd delivered on his promise. Mr Rudd said he would either fix public hospitals by 30th of 

 June or take them over, and he hasn’t done either. So it is up to Mr Rudd to deliver. He is going around from one 

 hospital to another, one picfac to another. It is all very good for his PR but it is not doing anything for the patients 

 that are missing out on these medical services that they deserve and that the AMA is so concerned about.  

 QUESTION:  

 Would the Coalition look at a takeover if you were in government?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 We are focused on what Mr Rudd has got to do. He is in government, he is the one that has to live up to his 

 promise. He said he would fix public hospitals or he would take them over. And he has done neither.  

 QUESTION:  

 Sure the AMA report suggests that states can’t run the health system the way it’s going?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well the AMA report identifies the many deficiencies and failings and the deterioration over the last year, a year 

 in which Mr Rudd of course has been in government. He can’t blame this on the previous government. That AMA 

 report is a damning indictment of his failures, and he has to be held accountable for them. He said he would 

 either fix it or take it over, and he has done neither.  

 QUESTION:  

 Kevin Andrews is suggesting an unlawful entrance visa stemming from the number of illegal boat arrivals that we 

 have been having lately. Is that a Coalition policy or is that something that he is putting up himself?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Mr Rudd has to tell us what he is going to do. It is his problem. He is Prime Minister. He is the one that 

 dismantled a border protection policy that worked. Illegal arrivals were negligible as a result of the Howard 

 Government’s policies. Mr Rudd dismantled them and in doing so said it would have no effect on arrivals. He said 

 it would have no effect.  

 The Labor Party described the Christmas Island detention centre as a white elephant. Now it is not going to be 

 able to cope with the flood of illegal immigrants. Mr Rudd’s policy has failed. He has no answers other than to 

 fling his hands in the air, shrug his shoulders and say there is nothing he can do about it.  

 What he has to do is take charge. It is all very well talking tough and describing people smugglers as vermin. 

 Let’s all agree that they’re very bad criminals. But what is he going to do about it? And the answer is so far, 

 nothing.  

 QUESTION:  

 …policies are working though, so what’s your alternative?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well we have proposed, given that he refuses to recognise that there even is a problem, we propose there be a 

 thorough, independent inquiry that can get the benefit of advice from the Federal Police, from security services, 

 to get all of that expert advice, examine which part of Mr Rudd’s blunderings have had the greatest impact on this 

 flood of arrivals, and examine a range of alternatives that could be put in place to stop it.  

 The fact is Mr Rudd has not even got to first base. He doesn’t even recognise or accept he has got a problem. 

 How many thousand illegal arrivals do we need before Mr Rudd is going to have to own up and say that his 

 border protection policies, his border protection policies have failed?  

 QUESTION:  

 You were saying this morning on radio that it won’t be long before asylum seekers will be processed on the 

 mainland. Where has that come from, do you....?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well this is what we are hearing from the Government. They have run out of places or are running out of places 

 at Christmas Island, and we know that they are looking actively at reopening detention centres on the mainland. 

 That is again a total failure of policy. But this is Mr Rudd’s failure of policy and he is the Prime Minister, he has to 

 deal with it.  

 QUESTION:  

 What do you think should happen to the Sri Lankans currently just in limbo up there off Indonesia?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well the reality is that these people chose…. seek to travel to Australia illegally. They have been with people 

 smugglers. They sought to enter Australia unlawfully, and they have been apprehended by the Indonesian 

 authorities, and they if they seek the protection of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees in Indonesia 

 then they should be dealt with accordingly. But they should not be rewarded for this effort by being admitted into 

 Australia.  

 Okay? Thanks very much.
