 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 06 May 2016   

  Save the Children compensation exposes government’s refugee advocates lies    

 The government’s attempts to blame advocates and support workers for the horrendous  situation on Nauru has backfired, with the Immigration Department being forced to pay  compensation to Save the Children Australia after accusing its workers of coaching self-harm on  the island.   

 “The situation on Nauru is no one’s fault but the government’s,” the Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The shameful practice of the government, which is to blame the victims and those advocating  for them, has backfired.   

 “These Save the Children workers were baselessly and unfairly accused of coaching self-harm  on Nauru. Earlier this week we saw the government trying it on again, blaming advocates for  giving refugees hope before two self-immolated.   

 “The fact of the matter is that hope is the only thing keeping many of the people on Nauru alive  at this stage.   

 “The government’s policy is designed to break people and the Immigration Minister must take  responsibility for that.”
