 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 401 REASONS WHY THE MALAYSIA  ARRANGEMENT WON’T MAKE ANY  DIFFERENCE TO THE PEOPLE SMUGGLERS April 18, 2013

 Another two boats carrying nearly 200 passengers have been intercepted in Australian waters, making it 10 illegal boat  arrivals in the last week alone, as Labor continues to do nothing to fix this crisis, Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration  and Citizenship and Shadow Minister for Justice Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “Since Labor signed their 800 for 4000 Malaysia swap deal there have been 401 illegal boat arrivals, carrying well over  25,000 people across Australia’s borders,” Mr Keenan said.

 “The 800 quota set for the Malaysia Deal was reached within the first seven days of April proving that in its current form  the arrangement would have no impact on stemming the flow of boats to our shores.

 “The idea that we would send 800 people to Malaysia and that would make one bit of difference to the people smugglers  is completely nonsensical.

 “The Government is using the Malaysia arrangement as an excuse to do nothing whilst the rate of boat arrivals continues  to flood our borders at an unprecedented rate.

 “Recently illegal boats are targeting mainland Australia in a bid to exploit the legal loophole that would exclude them from  being sent for offshore processing.

 “The Government is dragging its feet on passing legislation in the Senate that would excise the Australian mainland from  the migration zone - yet another example of Labor’s incompetence when it comes to implementing tough border  protection policies.

 “Labor won’t stop the boats as they don’t have the resolve to get the job done,” Mr Keenan said.
