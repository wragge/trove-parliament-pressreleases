 DOORSTOP INTERVIEW   

 SYDNEY 

  1PM TUESDAY 12 JANUARY 2010

 Topics: The Rudd government’s wasteful and reckless spending, NSW State government, Oceanic Viking asylum  seekers, schools funding for the Exclusive Brethren, Henry Review 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 The big issue for Australians this year on the economy front will be rising interest rates and the lack of access to  credit.  The affordability of credit will be a major issue for small business in 2010 and rising interest rates will be  the big issue for families and those who have mortgages as they battle to eke out a living on a day-to-day basis.  

 Today there are more revelations that the federal government is spending money at a rate that no previous  government has.  Today there is more evidence that the government is spending recklessly and that is putting  upward pressure on interest rates, which will hit Australian families between the eyes.  

 The best way to reduce upward pressure on interest rates is for the government to stop spending so much  money.  If the government continues to spend at reckless levels, the impact on Australian families in 2010 will be  devastating in the form of higher interest rates.  

 As each day passes, more evidence emerges that the government’s spending is out of control. Whether it be  building school halls, putting computers in schools or be it a raft of programs that we have identified today and as  are identified in The Australian, the clear evidence is that this government’s reckless spending will continue to put  upward pressure on interest rates and that will hit Australian families right between the eyes.  

 I think as we continue into the new year, there will be more and more evidence that not only is finance harder to  get, but it becomes more expensive.  Today we saw the housing finance data released which indicate that  housing finance is down.  That is further evidence of the fact that Australians are finding it more difficult to get  credit.  Moreover, that credit is increasingly expensive and will continue to be expensive whilst the government  spends so much money.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 [inaudible] spending cap. Why are you so convinced that it needs to rein spending in" 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Well there are more than 20 programs where the government has well exceeded its two per cent cap but most  obviously the government has exceeded its two percent cap on areas such as schools, school halls - where we 

 saw a blowout in excess of $1.5 billion on the school hall program. We saw a massive blowout in the ‘Computers  in Schools’ program.  This is a government that doesn’t know when to stop spending.  

 It’s easy for Kevin Rudd, who is missing in action over this summer holiday, it’s easy for him to spend other  people’s money, but it’s damn hard to save other people’s money and it’s damn hard to pull back on spending.   And unfortunately the federal goverment doesn’t know when to pull back on spending.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 Will the impact on small business affect employment, for instance?  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Well it will ultimately impact on employment because you’ve got to understand that in the last year, big business  has been able to raise capital, mainly because they’re more likely than not publicly-listed businesses and it’s easy  for them to raise capital, even at a discount to the last traded share price.  But how does a small baker or an  electrician or a retail shop owner, how do they raise capital to reduce their debt?  It’s only by taking money out of  the family home, it’s only by taking money out of the bank.  They can’t go and issue shares as they’d find it very  hard to have investors.  

 Therefore small business has been the most obvious target for the banks in their interest rate increases.  The  interest rates did not come down as signficantly for small business as they did for home owners previously and  now we’re seeing small business feel the true impact of rising interest rates.  

 And obviously small business never comes into the equation of the Rudd government. Just look at the fact that  they’re spending $10 millon on the union movement educating workers about the new industrial relations laws,  but the two million small businesses that could end up paying the fines have no education program at all.  It says  everything about the priorities of the Rudd government.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 Have you got anything to say about the specific standing of New South Wales at the moment financially given the  figures of the other day?  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 New South Wales is leaderless. New South Wales has no direction. Whether it be Premier Keneally, or Nathan  Rees, or Morris Iemma, New South Wales has been without leadership for effectively 10 years. And I would say  to the people of New South Wales that the sooner we have a change of government in this State, the sooner  we’re going to get back on track and we’re going to have eonomic growth that we can be proud of.  

 I mean I grew up in a State that was proud, that held the leadership position of all States in Australia. Quite  frankly, New South Wales’ economic performance is an embarrassment and it’s because of the lack of leadership  at a State level and the fact that the Rudd government has no senior, significant Ministers based in New South  Wales.  For the first time in perhaps a generation of politics, we don’t have either a Prime Minister, a Deputy  Prime Minister or a Treasurer based in New South Wales, and that says everything about the priorities of the  national government.   

 It’s also a fact that the Keneally government is an embarrassment to everyone in New South Wales.  The sooner  we get rid of them, the better.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 Back on government funding, do you think that the $70 million that was handed to the Bretheren by the  government school funding. Do you think it’s an exorbitant amount especially considering Kevin Rudd has in the  past labelled it an “extremist cult”? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Well this is where the Prime Minsiter’s words come back to haunt him. I mean if Kevin Rudd called them an  “extremist cult”, why is he funding them? And of course they’re not an extremist cult. They are as legitimite as the 

 law determines them to be. Obviously they are lawfully, legally receiving this money and it was Kevin Rudd that  described them as an “extremist cult”.  Now it’s up to Kevin Rudd to do something about it.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 [inaudible] 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 I mean, this is just like FuelWatch, GroceryWatch, taking over our hospitals by the middle of 2009, declaring war  on executive salaries, declaring war on drugs, declaring war on a range of things, standing up on asylum  seekers.  I mean, this is Kevin Rudd writ large - all talk, no delivery.  He was the one that set the highjump bar  and he’s failed to jump over it.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 [inaudible] The four asylum seekers that were denied entry, the ones that were on the Oceanic Viking.  Is this a  further blow to the government’s credibility on the whole handling of that issue? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Well as I recall, Kevin Rudd called on Wilson Tuckey to apologise when Wilson Tuckey said that some of these  people may have links to terrorist organisations.  More fool Kevin Rudd for coming out and saying that, you know,  Wilson Tuckey should apologise.  I think Wilson’s had a win there and I’m one of those people rather reluctant to  give Wilson a tick for a win, but he deserves recognition for the fact that of course there are going to be risks with  unsolicited arrivals in Australia.  

 Kevin Rudd promised to turn the boats back. He hasn’t and he’s a hypocrite for it, as he is on most things where  he makes promises and he doesn’t deliver.  I’m sorry that the Prime Minister is not being fair dinkum with the  Australian people about the risk of unsolicited arrivals on our shores.  I’m sorry that the Prime Minister’s not being  fair dinkum with the Australian people about hospitals, or about grocery prices, or the rising impact of interest  rates.  It’s disappointing for Australians at the beginning of 2010 that their Prime Minister is not being fair dinkum  with them.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 Mr Hockey, is it Coalition policy to increase the tax on cigarettes instead of putting up the cost of private health  insurance? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Yes it is and again I call on the Treasurer to release the Henry Review.  The irony is that the man that fashioned  the Henry Review, Ken Henry, has delivered it to the government and now Ken Henry is writing the government’s  response.  So I don’t know why the government doesn’t just release the initial report so that we can get on with  an open, transparent debate about tax.  

 All these rather insipid leaks of supposedly parts of the Henry Review, I don’t understand why the government’s  in the business of self-flagellation on tax.  I would think they should be in the business of an open, transparent  debate about the tax agenda for Australia, which would allow us to get on with the job of having a sophisticated  economic debate about how to have a tax system that delivers greater economic growth.  But, sadly, you’ve got  New South Wales’ Labor writ large in Canberra.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 Can I just ask, sorry, again on further, back on the Bretheren and the amount of funding. Do you, do you find that,  do you think that $70 million is too much for schools that are not … 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 There is a formula for school funding and it has been a consistent formula for a number of years now.  Again, the  Labor Party said it would review it, it didn’t, it kept to it.  There’s some irony in that.  

 The Exclusive Bretheren, if they’re entitled to the money, legally entitled to the money, they should receive the  money. I don’t have a problem with that, what I have a problem with is Exclusive Bretheren being described by  the Prime Minister as a cult and yet he funds them. That’s what I have a problem with. And, look, as much as I  would profess to have some theological interest, I would not suggest for a moment that I’m an expert on the  Exclusive Bretheren. What I do know is that there are people who determine whether it is lawful for them to  receive money. There are thousands of bureaucrats in the Department of Education in Canberra and they don’t  teach one pupil, so I assume that they are actually spending their time looking at organisations and church  groups like Exclusive Bretheren to determine whether they should lawfully be receiving money and if they are,  then that’s fine by me.  But if, as the Prime Minister says, they are a cult, then I would say to the Prime Minister -  live up to your words and deny them funding but do not pretend to be one thing and do something else.
