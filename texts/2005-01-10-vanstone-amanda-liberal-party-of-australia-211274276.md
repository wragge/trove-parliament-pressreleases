 Most Arrivals in a Decade to Queensland

 VPS 008/2005

 Queensland attracted the largest number of migrants and refugee entrants in a decade in 2003-04, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural  and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today.

 More than 20 000 people arrived and settled in Queensland in 2003-04, an increase of more than 4000 from the previous year’s total of 16 182.

 ‘The increase is in line with a general upwards trend over the past decade - in 1993-94 just 10 000 settlers arrived in Queensland,’ Senator  Vanstone said.

 ‘This means that in the past 10 years Queensland arrivals have increased by over 97 per cent and the national increase has been 60 per cent, with  well over 200 countries represented.

 ‘Australia has a wonderfully rich and diverse society as a result, with nearly one in four of Australia’s 20 million people born overseas.

 Australia-wide, the largest number of people came from the United Kingdom (18 000), followed by people from New Zealand, China, India, South  Africa, the Sudan and the Philippines.

 ‘On top of these figures are the growing numbers of people becoming permanent residents after arriving in Australia, such as overseas students  who apply for skilled migration onshore,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘Our ongoing commitment to new and innovative visa programs and the increased efficiency and integrity of immigration processing means that  Australia continues to attract more and more people from around the globe.’
