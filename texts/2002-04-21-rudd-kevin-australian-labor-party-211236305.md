 MEDIA RELEASE

 CONTINUED CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST

 Following the conclusion of the visit by the United States Secretary of State, Colin Powell, to the Middle East, the efforts of the international community must continue to focus on bringing an end to the current violence in order to initiate negotiations on a comprehensive security and political settlement between Israel and the Palestinian people.

 It is regrettable that despite United Nations Security Council Resolution 1402 of 30 March, Secretary Powellâ€™s efforts and calls by the international community, including US President Bush, a ceasefire has not been reached, Israel has still not fully withdrawn from Palestinian settlements and there has been no comprehensive repudiation by Chairman Arafat of terrorism of the campaign of suicide bombings against Israel.

 Of critical importance is for Israel to give international humanitarian agencies, including search and rescue teams, full and immediate access to the Palestinian territories in accordance with international humanitarian law governing the protection of civilian populations in armed conflict.  The search and rescue teams must also be given proper assistance by Israeli authorities to allow them to do their job properly. It is entirely regrettable that this access has not been granted to date.

 A further priority is the reconstruction of the civil infrastructure of Palestinian settlements that have been occupied by the Israeli armed forces. The destruction of power and water supplies and sewerage systems pose an additional threat to the civilian populations of these settlements.

 There is also deep concern at reports of a massacre of Palestinian civilians at the Jenin refugee camp.  Labor supports the UN Security Council fact-finding mission on these reports. Labor also notes that this mission is supported by the United States. It is curious that Foreign Minister Downer, virtually unique among western foreign ministers, is reported from Brussels as not supporting this investigation describing it as premature. It is critical that all parties cooperate fully with this investigation.

 The path ahead for the Middle East peace process is extremely difficult in the absence of a ceasefire. The incrementalist approach of the past based on series of confidence and security building measures post-Oslo no longer appears to be functional.

 Ends 21 April
