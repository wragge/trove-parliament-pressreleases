 Australia leads in war on desertification 

 June 16, 2009 - for immediate release 

 Desertification is playing a key role in accelerating global climate change - and Australia may have 

 some answers, scientists at the Desert Knowledge CRC said today. 

 “The World Resources Institute has estimated that as much as 300 million tonnes of carbon are lost to 

 the atmosphere from drylands as a result of desertification each year - about 4 per cent of global 

 emissions,” DKCRC’s Dr Mark Stafford Smith says. “It also undermines the livelihoods of up to 250 

 million vulnerable people, creating conflict, humanitarian crises and environmental refugees. This 

 makes desertification a major concern for everyone.” 

 “However in Australia we have seen recent evidence that desert vegetation cover - and hence carbon 

 storage - may actually be improving. This underlines the importance, first of understanding what is 

 really going on and second, of taking the right management approaches.” 

 “Looking after our deserts better will not only help to curb greenhouse emissions, it will also protect our 

 native species and landscapes and make pastoralism more sustainable. You could say it is a no 

 regrets policy,” Dr Stafford Smith says. 

 His comments come on the eve of the United Nations’ World Day to Combat Desertification, which is 

 observed every year on June 17. Drylands occupy nearly a third of the world’s land area and support 

 two billion people. Estimates suggest as much as 20 per cent of the world’s drylands are degraded or 

 desertified - meaning that humans are taking more from them than these regions can renewably 

 provide. This has caused long-term loss of productivity. 

 Globally, 20,000 to 50,000 square kilometres are lost annually through land degradation, chiefly soil 

 erosion, due to unsustainable land management and climate change. Losses in Africa, Latin America 

 and Asia are 2-6 times higher than in the developed regions. China is experiencing severe 

 desertification over a vast area, roughly equivalent to 35 per cent of the country’s territory, according to 

 the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development.  

 Among Australia’s leading contributions to the global battle against desertification is ACRIS, the 

 Australian Collaborative Rangelands Information System, which is being looked at internationally as a 

 model for how to monitor desertification, in the lead-up to the UN Convention on Desertification 

 conference in Buenos Aires in September this year. 

 ACRIS - a joint program involving state and Federal Government agencies - has pioneered a 

 collaborative system for recording and reporting on environmental, economic and social changes in 

 the rangelands.  

 

 “We have managed to bring together various different data sets from state and Northern Territory 

 government sources to create a national picture of the condition of our rangelands - one that is 

 founded on hard data, rather than expert opinion,” explains ACRIS coordinator Mr Gary Bastin. Above 

 all the information system looks at how the rangelands function - their level of vegetation cover, the 

 landscape’s ability to take up water, provide forage for pastoralism, the impacts of rainfall, drought, 

 erosion, fire and grazing and the human and ecological responses to all three. 

 In 2008, ACRIS produced a landmark national review of condition and trends across Australia’s 

 rangelands - the first objective survey of the dry regions of the continent as a whole. “You’d have to 

 say that things are holding up pretty well,” says Mr Bastin. “The survey is focussed mainly on the 

 pastoral regions but, allowing for seasonal variations, there is no strong prevailing sense that modern 

 grazing practices are having a widespread adverse impact.” 

 Queensland has recently introduced satellite monitoring of rangeland condition and Gary hopes this 

 will eventually extend to cover the whole continent, giving Australia a truly world-leading system for 

 managing rangelands sustainably. 

 “The fact that this is a highly co-operative effort across different governments here, we’re hoping, can 

 serve as a model for international collaboration on monitoring the conditions of the world’s dry lands 

 and for the future prevention of desertification,” Gary says.  

 

 The Desert Knowledge CRC is helping to fight desertification in many other ways, explains Managing 

 Director Jan Ferguson. “Among our many research programs aimed at this problem, four are 

 particularly worth mentioning as helping to change the way we care for our continent, its desert areas 

 and their people,” she says. 

 These are:  

 â¢ A recent major study of the Lake Eyre Basin highlighting how regional-scale coordination is 

 necessary to control desertification and caring for desert landscapes, and how thinly-scattered local 

 communities need more support in this role.  

 â¢ DKCRC’s WaterSmart PastoralismTM project which demonstrated practical ways that pastoralists 

 can save both money and water using advanced technologies like telemetry.  

 â¢ The nation’s leading study of wind erosion, the formation of a national DustWatch network to observe 

 major soil movements in the deserts, and advice for pastoralists on how to reduce erosion risk.  

 â¢ Research into desert fire behaviour is establishing state-of-the-art knowledge about how to manage 

 fires for enhanced vegetation cover as well as protection of people and infrastructure in regions such 

 as the Tanami desert, the NT pastoral lands, Central Australia, the acacia scrublands and desert 

 national parks.
