 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Wednesday, 14 January 2015    

 Desperation leads to Manus Island hunger strike    

 The protest and hunger strikes at the Manus Island detention centre are a desperate call for  help, the Australian Greens have said.    

 “Refugees inside the Manus Island detention camp are clearly suffering and have resorted to  self-harm in an act of desperation, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “Eye witness reports from staff inside the camp contradict comments made by the Department  of Immigration. These are serious allegations and the Minister must explain what is really going  on.    

 “As tensions rise inside the centre, the violent attacks which resulted in the death of Reza Berati  remain at the forefront of the refugee’s minds as the 12 month anniversary approaches.    

 “The government cannot continue to dismiss the concerns of those detained at the centre. We  know that such actions will only lead to further anxiety and distress.    

 “The only way to end the human suffering is to bring those detained at the camp to Australia.    

 “The Australian public have a right to know what is really going, the Minister must open the  gates to the media.    

 “Minister Dutton has the opportunity to be upfront and transparent about the conditions at the  Manus Island detention centre, rather than follow in the footsteps of his predecessor.”
