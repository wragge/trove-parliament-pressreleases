 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 400th ILLEGAL BOAT ARRIVAL THIS  FINANCIAL YEAR June 30, 2013

 400 illegal boats have arrived in Australia this financial year - almost four times as many as last financial year, making it  the biggest ever on record, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “This latest arrival, carrying 47 passengers, is the 40th boat to arrive this month as Labor’s border protection failures  continue,” Mr Keenan said.

 “The fact that since Mr Rudd resumed the Prime Ministership, we have had four more illegal boat arrivals announced, with  a total of 259 people on board,  is just a reminder that this is one of his greatest failures as Prime Minister.

 “How can the very man, who was responsible for this border crisis, be trusted to stop the people smuggling trade he  reinvigorated as Prime Minister.

 “Kevin Rudd has spent three years plotting his return to the Prime Ministership so on that basis one would assume he had  answers to this crisis at our borders yet unsurprisingly we haven’t seen any evidence of that yet.

 “The Coalition has a plan to put an end to the people smuggling trade - a plan that will work because it has already done  so in the past,” Mr Keenan said.
