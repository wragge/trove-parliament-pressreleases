 The Migration Program

 The Ministers discussed the size and composition of the 1994/95 Migration  Program. Key factors expected to contribute to a moderate upward trend in  migration program numbers including indications of increases in demand for  migration, flowing from a stronger economy.

 The Humanitarian Program

 The Ministers supported a continuing commitment to a substantial Humanitarian  program and the priorities of the Humanitarian program responding as it does to the  need for resettlement of people from the former Yugoslavia while responding to  other humanitarian situations, particularly when people affected have close links  with Australia. -

 They also noted the continuing decline in resettlement of people from Indo-China  and the success of the Special Assistance Category (SAC) for those who have  experienced hardship and suffering and have close links with Australia.

 . the Government introduced a new SAC in October 1993 for Cambodians with  close links to Australia who had been resident in Cambodia for twelve months  before lodging their application. The SAC has attracted strong interest and  600 places have been allocated in 1993/94.

 Migration Reform Act

 The Ministers noted the introduction on 1 September 1994 of the provisions of the  Migration Reform Act 1992 which are designed to clarify aspects of the  administration of migration legislation.

 They noted that the changes will impact on the law and policy underlying the  processes by which people enter, remain in, and leave Australia although the direct  effect on the public is expected to be limited.

 1 November 1993 Decisions

 The Ministers discussed the implementation of the Government's decision to allow  members of the following groups to remain permanently in Australia:

 . PRC nationals in Australia on 20 June 1989 and their family members in  Australia

 . Better qualified asylum seekers who had applied for refugee status before 1  November 1993 and humanitarian temporary entry holders from the former  Yugoslavia and Sri Lanka

 . highly qualified students

 . refugee status holders

 The Ministers noted that the decision honoured a commitment that the PRC  nationals who were in Australia at the time of Tienanmen Square would not be  forced to return to the PRC.

 National Integrated Settlement Strategy

 Ministers endorsed the progress made by Commonwealth/State/Territory Settlement  Planning Committees towards the development and implementation of collaborative  settlement plans.

 In particular they welcomed the improved level of cooperation between States and  Territories in moving towards an integrated and planned approach to the way  settlement services are made available to migrants.

 The Ministers noted that at the next Ministers meeting the Commonwealth would  table a paper presenting the scope and level of Commonwealth services for  migrants including funding allocations. The purpose of the paper would be to  provide a basis for analysis of Commonwealth services to migrants in the 

 Commonwealth, State and Local Government spheres.

 Ministers also noted the progress report on Commonwealth ESL provisions and  agreed that there continue to be ongoing progress reports at forthcoming Ministers'  and Officials' Meetings, particularly in the context of the proposed evaluations of  Commonwealth ESL programs to be conducted during 1994/95.

 Progress in access and equity

 Ministers noted that the next phase of the Commonwealth's plan would be based on  additional consultative and participative processes, and noted the progress in the

 States in developing and implementing a range of plans to improve service delivery.
