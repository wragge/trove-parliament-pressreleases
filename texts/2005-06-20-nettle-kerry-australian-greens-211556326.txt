 Qasim still denied a normal life - Minister  should apologise 

 20th Jun 2005 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today welcomed the news that Peter  Qasim, Australia's longest serving immigration detainee, may be  released into the community on a new 'removal pending visa', but The  Greens will continue to call for permanent protection for 'stateless'  people like Mr Qasim.  "It is great news that the pressure that refugee advocates across the  country have put on the government has led to the imminent release  of Peter Qasim," Senator Nettle said. "I hope that this good news will  help Peter recover from the mental scars that seven years of  immigration detention has left him with."  "I have visited Peter on two occasions in Baxter Detention Centre. I  know how hard it has been for him to be locked away for much of his  youth, and know what a great member of the Australian community he  will make.  "It remains disappointing that Mr Qasim will not be granted permanent  residency and that he will have to live with the threat of being  deported sometime into the future.  "Mr Qasim has lost seven years of his life as a result of this  government's inhumane policies. The compassionate thing to do is to  give him a permanent visa.  "The Minister should show much needed leadership in changing the  culture of her department by granting Mr Qasim a permanent visa and  apologising to Mr Qasim for keeping him detained for such a long time.  "The Greens oppose the mandatory detention of asylum seekers and  call for all detainees to be released subject to standard health and  security checks."  Contact - Jon Edwards 0428 213 146
