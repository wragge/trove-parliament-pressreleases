  GOVERNMENT TO LIMIT REFUGEE AND IMMIGRATION LITIGATION 

  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock has announced  plans to limit the growing cost and incidence of litigation of refugee and immigration  decisions. 

  "There has been significant growth in cases going to the courts in recent years and this  has added to delays and has cost the taxpayer millions of dollars," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "Immigration and refugee applicants have access to a thorough merits assessment of  their case. If they are unhappy with the outcome, they can seek independent merits  review before a Tribunal, so they have every chance to put their case." 

  "However, in addition they can also access the Federal and High Courts, giving them  up to three levels of judicial review." 

  There are currently 623 active litigation cases in the Immigration portfolio, of which 422  relate to on-shore refugee decisions. 

  A substantial proportion of these cases will be withdrawn prior to hearing. Of those  cases that do go onto substantive hearings, the Government currently wins 89% . 

  "Many people are using litigation to delay their departure, even though they have no  legitimate claim to remain in Australia," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "To address this issue, the Government will introduce a 'privative clause' for many  decisions under the Migration Act, to effectively limit the volume and cost of litigation ." 

  A privative clause is a provision within an Act of Parliament, the practical effect of which  will be to limit judicial review to whether the decision maker made a decision that was  within their jurisdiction and power to make . This does not affect access to merits  review. 

  The Government has received advice from several leading Queens Counsel that thisâ‘  is likely to be the most effective way of addressing this problem. 

  The change, foreshadowed last week follows the Coalition commitment to undertake a  review of immigration decision-making and is in line with the Government's  determination to simplify the decision-making system . 

  The 1995-96 Budget shows that litigation cost the Department of Immigration and  Multicultural Affairs $7.4 million dollars. This does not include legal aid nor the cost of  running the Courts.
