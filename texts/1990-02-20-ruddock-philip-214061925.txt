 PHILIP RUDDOCK Shadow Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs

 IMMIGRATION - IMPLICATIONS OF CHANGE IN EASTERN EUROPE

 Australia should now be re-ordering its migration staff  arrangements in European Overseas Posts Philip Ruddock, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs said  today.

 In the aftermath of Eastern European reform a new public  awareness program on Australia's non-discriminatory  immigration policy should be undertaken in Eastern Europe. Upto now the recognized international right of individuals  to emmigrate has been denied to Eastern Europeans.

 Now with change it is unlikely that in future Eastern  Europeans from Romania, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Bulgaria will be able to satisfy refugee  criteria. The test is on a case by case examination of 

 facts to assertain if the claimant has a "well founded  fear of persecutionin their home country."

 At 30th June last, Australia only had immigration staff in  one Eastern European country, namely Poland with one  Australian Officer and six locally engaged staff.

 Our commitment to refugees was seen by the numbers of officers  in our German and Austrian missions. .

 Germany - 3 Australian based staff and 15 locally engaged

 Austria - 2 Australian based staff and 7 locally engaged

 As Eastern Europe has experienced a closed press, now is the time  to catch up and ensure that Eastern Europeans are as aware as the  rest of Europe, Asia and the world generally, that selective  migration to Australia is available.

 P.T.O.

 It goes without saying that with a good education and a highly  trained and skilled workforce background, many Eastern Europeans  would be eligible for entry.

 Likewise, family reunion possibilities should e x i s t .

 Opportunities will be lost to Australia, and Eastern European  potenial migrants discriminated against if staffing arrangements  are not quickly re-ordered.

 A  public information campaign about migration is also necessary  to ensure the disadvantage of having lived in a closed society,  is overcome 11

 GOVERNMENT SURVEYS IMMIGRATION PROSPECTS IH EASTERN EUROPE

 A senior Immigration Department officer will visit Eastern  Europe next month to. survey the need for migration services  in the region.

 The Overseas Operations Branch Assistant Secretary, Mr Keith  Owen, will visit Moscow, Warsaw, Vienna, Budapest and  Belgrade. -

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, said the visit would ensure his  department's operations kept pace with the rapid political  and social changes occurring in Eastern Europe.

 '  "To date, migration movement from Eastern Europe has been  almost exclusively confined to refugees," he said.

 "Now, there is the prospect of a free flow of people, some 

 wanting to join relatives in Australia, others trying to  better their economic prospects through migration.

 "My department is gearing up to deal with the changed  circumstances."

 Senator Ray said that to date, there had been no surge of 

 people, inquiring about migration, apart from in the Soviet  Union where considerable preliminary interest had been  s h o w n . '

 Elsewhere, people appeared preoccupied with the sudden rush  towards democracy.

 "When the present turbulence settles down, citizens of these  countries will be able to make judgements about where they  want to live and work," he said.

 "In addition to deciding on the best locations for^ new  migration offices, arrangements will have to be developed  for the processing of applicants.

 Ï*Î· ,Î¡· ^ '  > "This will involve identifying «additional reliable medical and radiological facilities for screening prospective m i g r a n t s , and developing.procedures for assessing- and evaluating Eastern European education and employment qualifications."Senator Ray said suggestions that migration to Australia from the region had been hampered by a lack of staff to process cases were clearly wrong.The Department had resources in G e r m a n y , Austria and Italy which had effectively met the Eastern European refugee demand to date. Within the Eastern region itself, the department was represented in Moscow, Warsaw and Belgrade."We expect a decreasing need for Australian migration resources in the traditional Western European countries of first asylum," the Minister said."Instead, we will be investigating the placement of additional resources in some Eastern European countries to handle migration inquiries and applications at the source."We want to normalise our migration operations in the region." ·  'Senator Ray emphasised that priority in migration processing would continue to be given to those seeking reuniorccwith close family members in Australia."There have been long delays in many cases in countries such as Romania because the local authorities refused to grant passports or exit p e r m i t s ," he said."We will be doing everything we can to expedite the entry of people who qualify under the family migration c a t e g o r y , just as soon as they are allowed to leave."The Minister said nearly 1400 Romanians were currently seeking migrant visas through the Australian Embassy in Belgrade.Over 400 of them had been approved to come to Australia and could be granted visas as soon as they were able to present a passport. .CANBERRA, 14 February 1990 ,MEDIA INQUIRIES: Peter Cotton Minister's Office (062) 77 7860Allan Rice DILGEA (062) 64 2382
