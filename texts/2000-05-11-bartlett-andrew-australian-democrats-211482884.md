 Fortress Australia…

 The Government is pouring resources into keeping people out of Australia, while ignoring the need to upgrade tourist and immigration visas processes, according to the Australian Democrats.

 “This Government is so obsessed with looking tough on refugees and portraying most migrants as an economic cost that they are costing Australia millions in lost potential from migrants, as well as from reduced tourism and business investment,” said Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Democrats’ immigration spokesperson.

 The Budget outlines that the Immigration Department has two key outcomes:

 1. Lawful and orderly entry and stay of people; and

 2. A society which values Australian citizenship, appreciates cultural diversity and enables migrants to participate equitably.

 “The Government are spending over 5 times more money on their first aim - policing immigration and border protection - than they are on ensuring Australia gets the economic and social benefits of immigration and multiculturalism,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “This would not be so bad if they were putting more money into overseas posts and consulates to enable the faster processing of temporary visas, but they are not.”

 The Migration Department is also responsible for processing and approving tourist, business and other temporary visas in far greater numbers than the permanent migration program.

 “Extra funding is needed to improve service in this area - extra money

 which would be quickly repaid in extra tourism and investment dollars for Australia,” Senator Bartlett said.

 “Instead we have more than $115 million of extra spending on detention centres and ‘border integrity’ measures, whilst there is a slight cut in real funding for positive settlement assistance programs.

 “Nowhere is this negative and punitive approach more clear than the government’s intention to find new ways to cut refugees off social security payments by forcing them to work for the benefits.

 “Whilst the Democrats do not oppose all measures to reduce people smuggling, this Budget shows how completely distorted the Government’s priorities are,” he said.

 “Rather than looking for ways to reap the benefits of migration, the Government is unnecessarily spending money to make life more difficult for refugees, whilst reducing funding which would assist migrants and refugees be more productive members of the Australian community.”
