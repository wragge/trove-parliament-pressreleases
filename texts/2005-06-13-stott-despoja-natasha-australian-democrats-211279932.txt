 Dick Smith Right - Release Qasim now

 The Governments continued detention of Peter Qasim is a national disgrace, according to the Australian  Democrats. Australian Democrats Senator for South Australia Natasha Stott Despoja said the Governments claim that Mr  Qasim could not be released because the Department of Immigration was still unable to clearly identify him  (1) after almost seven years in detention, was indefensible.  It is little wonder Australians like Dick Smith are concerned by Peters case, Senator Stott Despoja said. Not only has he had to endure almost seven years of soul-destroying detention, the Government also refuses  to say when or even if it will release him. Continued detention and the uncertainty over his future are clearly having a devastating effect on Peters  health. When I have visited Peter, I have been struck by his growing sense of despondency. "Following last years High Court ruling on indefinite detention, Mr Qasim now faces the possibility of being  detained in Australia for the rest of his natural life unless the Government intervenes in his case. As a Kashmiri man, who the Indian Government refuses to recognise, Mr Qasim effectively is 'stateless' and  is trapped in bureaucratic limbo. "Although he has been eligible for deportation since January 1999 and signed documents requesting this  deportation in 2003, the Department of Immigration is unable to return him.  "He has approached more than 80 countries to grant him asylum but, so far, none have agreed to accept him. I urge the Minister for Immigration to review Peters case as a matter of urgency and, at the very least, grant  him a temporary protection visa to allow him to live in the community with his friends and supporters while the  Government continues to verify his identity, Senator Stott Despoja said.
