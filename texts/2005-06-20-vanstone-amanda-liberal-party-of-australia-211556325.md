 New Booklet Highlights Australia’s Response to Refugees

 VPS 079/2005

 ‘By the end of this month, Australia will have granted about 13 000 visas to refugees and others in need of resettlement through the 2004-05  Humanitarian Program,’ Minister for Immigration, Amanda Vanstone said today.

 ‘Australia’s role in helping people in need of humanitarian assistance is highlighted in the 2005 publication Refugee and Humanitarian Issues -  Australia’s response,’ Senator Vanstone said. 

 The publication will be launched today, World Refugee Day at Parliament House in Canberra.

 ‘The theme of World Refugee Day is ‘Courage’ and the personal accounts in the booklet highlight this theme,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘I hope the 2005 booklet will help the Australian public to understand and appreciate the Government’s and Australians commitment to helping  refugees around the world.

 ‘Later this year we will welcome the 100 000th person to have come to Australia under the resettlement program during the past decade.

 ‘Australia consistently ranks as one of the top three countries resettling refugees every year. 

 ‘We also offer some of the best settlement services in the world to our refugees and humanitarian entrants.

 ‘In 2004 the Government expressed its continuing commitment to refugees by increasing the Humanitarian Program from 12 000 to 13 000 places.  This includes an increase in the refugee component from 4000 to 6000 places - making the refugee component the largest in 20 years.

 ‘The Special Humanitarian Program is set at 7000 places.

 ‘The coming years will see Australia maintain its position as one of the leading countries in the world in providing refugee and humanitarian  resettlement assistance,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 Copies of the booklet can be sourced from the Department of Immigration website www.immi.gov.au.
