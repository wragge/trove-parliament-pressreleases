 ADDRESS TO THE 16TH NATIONAL ETHNIC AND MULTICULTURAL 

 BROADCASTERS' CONFERENCE 

 ADELAIDE 

 11 OCTOBER 1996

 Mr Zangalis, Parliamentary Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen.

 Thankyou for the opportunity to address this - the 16th National Ethnic Broadcasters'  Conference.

 I am particularly glad to have the opportunity to address you tonight because of my  great admiration for the ethnic broadcasting sector generally.

 Of course, we live in a world of media as big business, and we hear almost daily of  the machinations of huge media groups vying for mass audiences. I have spent  most of the last 13 years as a public figure dealing with them at the sharp end.

 Big media organisations attract a great deal of Government attention, and, indeed, a  great deal of their own attention. ’

 It is too easy in the context of there being such big fish in the sea to forget the needs  of a smaller sector such as community broadcasting in general and ethnic  broadcasting in particular.

 But these organisations live and die by Government support.

 They are also deeply deserving of Government support.

 Ethnic broadcasting necessarily attracts smaller numbers of listeners because they  service such specific groups. But this focus is simultaneously the biggest indicator  of their success. They are a vitally important way of getting information,  entertainment and a sense of community to migrant communities often isolated by 

 little knowledge of English.

 Like all community radio stations, they rarely have enough funding to perform these  important tasks, and like all community radio stations, they rely heavily on a  dedicated band of volunteers to continue their service.

 These are true grassroots community organisations, and therefore ones I am very  grateful of the opportunity both to address, but also to listen to their concerns as we  in the Labor Party go about compiling the policies to carry us back into Government  in two-and-a-half years' time.

 I would like to take this opportunity of reassuring you that we in the Labor Party will  continue to support the ethnic broadcasting sector because we recognise its  importance to large numbers of people within the Australian community, the huge  dedication of the people who work in the sector (often voluntarily) and of course, the 

 necessity of Government support if the good work is to continue.

 In this regard, the Government's allocation of an additional $3 million to the sector  over the next three years is to be applauded.

 I know that my colleagues, Chris Schacht and Duncan Kerr, will be addressing your  conference to speak about Labor's policy on ethnic broadcasting. I do not wish to  preempt any of their comments here, other than to give you the assurance of our  continued support.

 I would, however, like to speak briefly on one issue which is central to the mission of  ethnic broadcasters in Australia. This is the question of multiculturalism. Ethnic  broadcasting has long been at the front line in making our diverse, multicultural  society work.

 It is the support the sector offers a series of often isolated ethnic communities which  has helped 'knit them in' to the fabric of Australian society - to make them feel that  this country is big enough to find a place for their culture here and thereby 

 encourage them to feel a part of and participate in the life and future of this country -  to the enduring benefit of Australia and their fellow Australians. '

 Part of the success of multiculturalism relies on a deep appreciation that the political  leadership of this country has a duty to govern for the nation as a whole, secure in  the knowledge that this whole is greater than the sum of its diverse parts.

 If, by your silence, you allow or encourage these parts to drift apart, you diminish the  entire community.

 Pauline Hanson is dead wrong in her belief that not all sections of the community  are of equal value.

 She calls for the 'abolition of multiculturalism'. I don't know how you can abolish  multiculturalism - you might as well call for the abolition of mateship for all the impact

 you can have on something which has been such a success and such a defining  aspect of the building of the modern Australian nation.

 Multiculturalism, after all, has its descriptive element. After years of migration from  nations of a non English speaking background we can be no other. It is important  also to point out that older Australian traditions have been enriched by this process.

 Long standing democratic values and institutions have been reaffirmed. Political  and economic freedom has been enhanced. Family life, so important in a stable and  nurturing society, has been strengthened by its significance across cultures. The  existence of these values, philosophies, institutions and possibilities in this country is  what made and makes us attractive as a place of settlement. It wasn’t really the  sun, the sea and the sand.

 Mrs Hanson’s views are not new. There is no-one here, participants in the different  waves of migration who have not heard them. Each generation of Australian  politicians had to debate them then as now. On the outcome of that ongoing debate  rides the nations prosperity, harmony and, ultimately, survival.

 The facts on immigration are that Australia has doubled its population since World  War II, largely due to high numbers of migrants arriving nearly every year for 50  years. Absorbing such large numbers of people from many different cultures has  been difficult but not monumental.

 Despite pressures the process has placed on social planning and the consequent  temporary hardship of each new wave of migrants to impact on our prosperity, has  been obvious to all on reflection. Nevertheless, the fact that Australia has managed  this while sustaining a fair society is recognised around the world as a major 

 achievement. Indeed, it was a factor in Australia securing the Olympic Games.

 In the past there has been general agreement that Australia needed a larger  population for economic and defence reasons. There was also a requirement for a  relatively rich country like Australia to take some refugees and others on  humanitarian grounds. '

 The immigration target set by the Howard Government for this year is 74,000. This  is historically quite low but is actually greater than the average of the past four years.  This is not a major point of disagreement between the Government and Opposition.

 There must always be a discussion about the appropriate level of migration to this  country and indeed there always has been. The levels of the last four or five years  of the Labor government were approximately half what they had been in the 1980s  and will probably continue at these historically low levels for some time.

 I can well recall detailed debates around the cabinet table on refugee and  humanitarian issues and levels, family reunion, skills needs and so on. This has  never been, and should never be, a matter treated by sleight of hand by the  government of the day. The potential impact of the intake on the employment

 prospects of Australians was always central with us and the related employability of  those coming. It is those considerations which have seen the rates reduced so  substantially.

 While overall that reduction has made job seeking for Australians easier, that is not  so in some sectors. The answer to the puzzlement among some in the housing  industry as to why competition among lending institutions and low interest rates have  not produced better outcomes in building commencements is partly due to lower  immigration. Likewise, restricting numbers does not of itself improve the 

 employment prospects of Australians if you pursue anti-growth policies and savage  cuts to training and related programs that enhance job readiness. We will all come  to understand this over the next year as long term jobless rates rise. Under this  Government’s policies, the unemployment rate is destined to freeze over 9% into the 

 next century.

 We must not allow a legitimate argument about the size of the intake to become  code for those opposed to the non-discriminatory nature of the composition. There  is a risk that it has. We benefit massively as a society from diversity. The  intelligence and skill of Australian business in lifting its export performance in the last  decade has to a large degree been due to our diversity. We all, as a result, have  familiarity with cross cultural negotiating. This means jobs for us and a chance for  our kids.

 There is another group who have come in for erroneously-based criticism by Mrs  Hanson.

 By virtually every measure Aborigines are the most disadvantaged group in  Australia. A significant part of this problem is due to the fact that many Aboriginal  people have little hope for the future and no faith that they will be permitted to lead  functional, happy lives. This in turn is due to their very harsh history.

 The reconciliation process is aimed at overcoming this deep pessimism as much as  providing material benefits. The lives of many Aborigines will not improve until they  have the confidence, trust and optimism to take advantage of opportunities  presented to them.

 Attacks such as those by Mrs Hanson, create more fear and mistrust. They make it  more likely that dependence on welfare will continue. The world isn't as simple as  Mrs Hanson suggests. I am reminded of Mencken's comment that to every complex  question, there is a simple answer. And it's wrong.

 In this uncertain world it is the job of political leaders to promote national political  debate which respects and encourages the dignity and unity of our people, of our  diverse community. You contribute to that process.

 I wish you a productive conference.

 Thankyou.
