 screening and eligibility policies reflect the interests and 

 wishes of the various parts of the community",  the Minister for

 Mr Macphee was commenting at the conclusion of the inaugural 

 meeting of the Australian Council on Population and" Ethnic- 

 Affairs in Melbourne today. "

 The Council will establish a Task Force which will,  over the 

 next few months,  be developing recommendations for Government

 Force includes people prominent in the ethnic community,  the 

 union movement,  industry and the professions,  as well as

 "At its meeting today,  the Council also had the benefit of 

 the presence of Mr M.J. Young,  M.P.,  Opposition Spokesman on  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  whose participation reflects 

 the importance placed on population immigration and ethnic  affairs matters by the Opposition as well as by the Government",  

 Mr Macphee said.

 The Council discussed the current year's migrant intake,  .

 which is now expected to be about 110,000. It expressed support: 

 for a continuing significant level of immigration in responce to 

 the strong desire of many members of the Australian community 

 to have members of their families join them. The Council also  supported a positive response through immigration to the growing 

 need for specialised skills for new development objects. The 

 Council also advocated substantial continuing refugee programs.
