 AA 05 15                              11 March 2005 

 

 Lessening the impact of conflict on vulnerable populations   

 I am pleased to announce a further allocation of $15 million from AusAID’s International  Refugee Fund to support refugees, internally displaced people (IDPs) and asylum seekers in  Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, South East Asia and the Pacific.   

 Australia’s International Refugee Fund was established in September 2002 and provides  assistance to protect these vulnerable groups, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.   

 The Fund also helps to reduce the incentive for displaced people to undertake hazardous  journeys to other countries within the region.   

 Since the fund was established, Australia has provided $45 million to support programs  delivered by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the United  Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the International Organisation of Migration (IOM), the  Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the United Nations  Development Program (UNDP) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).   

 In 2005 the $15 million will be shared by UNHCR, UNICEF and the IOM after proposals  submitted by these organisations were selected by AusAID and the Department of  Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.    

 UNHCR will receive $6.5 million for the protection, resettlement and reintegration of  refugees and IDPs in Afghanistan, and for protection and subsistence assistance for refugees  and asylum seekers in Asia and the Pacific.   

 UNICEF will receive $4.5 million to help IDPs and refugees in Sri Lanka, and to help protect  the rights of refugees and displaced children in South East Asia and the Pacific.   

 The IOM will receive $4 million to assist with the reintegration of Sri Lankan refugees  returning from India and to provide support for IDPs in Indonesia’s Aceh Province.    

 This new assistance forms part of AusAID’s humanitarian, emergency and refugee programs  which help lessen the adverse impacts of conflict and natural disasters on vulnerable  populations. Funding for these activities has increased by $13.7 million in 2004-05 to $146  million.
