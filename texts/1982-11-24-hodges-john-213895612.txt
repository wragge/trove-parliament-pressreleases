 FIRST MIGRANTS FROM VIETNAM

 Vietnamese in Australia should encourage their close 

 families in Vietnam to apply to enter Australia as 

 migrants rather than risk their lives by perilous sea ;  

 journey, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, 

 John Hodges, said today.

 Mr Hodges was speaking on the arrival of the first group 

 of migrants to be accepted under the migration 

 arrangement recently negotiated with Vietnam.

 The group of 170 who will arrive on Friday and Saturday 

 are all family reunion cases and will join relatives 

 in most States of Australia.

 "These people are the first to come from Vietnam as 

 ordinary migrants, not refugees",  Mr Hodges said.

 "They have been sponsored in Australia in exactly the 

 same way as other applicants around the w o r l d .  The cost 

 of their passage has been borne by themselves or their 

 sponsors here in Australia.

 "Like all other migrants, they have had to meet normal  globally applied entry rules for Australia."
