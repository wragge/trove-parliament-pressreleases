 Labor’s border chaos pushing Border Protection Command to breaking point 

 Posted on Wednesday, 2 November, 2011 

 

 Border Protection Command is under massive strain with their patrol boats being forced to  operate close to breaking point, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection  Michael Keenan said today. 

 “The men and women of Border Protection Command who are being asked to bear the brunt  of Labor’s policy mistakes are under enormous pressure to keep up with the massive influx of  illegal boats under this Labor Government,” he said. 

 “At the same time Labor have this border protection crisis of their own making they have cut  critical funds to Customs, including the slashing of the budget for aerial surveillance by $20.8  million and reducing aerial surveillance by 2,215 hours.  This irresponsible exercise is putting  extraordinary pressure on the naval patrol boats operating under Border Protection Command  who have to work at a completely unrealistic tempo to make up for Labor’s cuts to critical  border protection programs. 

 “Labor have taken the knife to Customs at every single budget by axing funding and  personnel.   This year’s budget cut a further 90 staff from Customs on top of the 250 cut in  the 2010-11 Budget.  They also cut $34 million for passenger facilitation at our airports and  cut funding for cargo screening at our borders by $58.1 million in the 2009-10 budget  resulting in even less cargo being x-rayed and physically examined to detect illicit drugs,  weapons and other contraband,” he said. 

 “Labor are putting the lives of our frontline men and women at risk by forcing them to  operate on vessels with serious defects due to the operational tempo and unavailability of  additional resources to deal with the influx in illegal boat arrivals. 

 “The Coalition is very concerned that the Government is putting our borders and our frontline  personnel at risk by forcing them to operate with less resources and with vessels that are  under strain from the operational pressures they are facing every day since Labor dismantled  our border protection regime,” Mr Keenan said.
