 EMBARGOED until Sunday, 28th July 2013   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Sunday, 28th July   

 Sarah Hanson-Young to launch television ad  featuring Malcolm Fraser   

 Greens Senator for South Australia, Sarah Hanson-Young will today launch an election ad featuring  former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser.   

 “Voters from both sides have been so disappointed by the old parties and their desperate race to  the bottom on refugees,” Senator Hanson-Young said.   

 Airing for the first time on Sunday night, the commercial looks at the need for humanity in political  debate.   

 “The refugee debate in Australia has hit a new low in recent days, but the Greens are standing up for  the rights of vulnerable people in Australia and in our region.   

 “Australians believe in giving people a fair-go but our nation’s generous heart is under attack from  Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott.   

 “Labor’s cruel deal with PNG, which dumps refugees in Australia’s own gulags, has been matched  with a disgraceful war on refugees from Tony Abbott’s Liberals.   

 “There are many long-time Labor and Liberal supporters who are shaking their heads at the old  parties’ rush to cruelty as they rush to the polls.”   

 A copy of the commercial is available upon request. Please email noah.schultz-byard@aph.gov.au
