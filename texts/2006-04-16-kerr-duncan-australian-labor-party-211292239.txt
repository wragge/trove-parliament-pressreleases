 -- MEDIA RELEASE --   

 16 April 2006   

 

 Papua New Guinea needs more focus and international help  to grapple with HIV/AIDS crisis   

 

 Duncan Kerr SC MP has just returned from a week visiting Papua New Guinea.  He  went to Port Moresby, Lae and the Markam Valley with three members of the New  Zealand Parliament.   

 Papua  New  Guinea  is  on  the  verge  of  an  HIV/Aids  crisis  -  with  estimates  that   between 1.3 and 3.5% of the population carry the virus.  Some experts claim about  half a million men, women, and children will be HIB positive within ten years unless  more effective measures are taken   

 The  government  of  Papua  New  Guinea  has  abandoned  its  previous  approach  of   denying the problem exists and is now taking action in the face of a looming crisis.    There are more than 8000 sex workers in Port Moresby alone.  HIV however is no  longer confined to high risk groups; it is also showing up in remote villages with the  worst prevalence in the highlands.   

 “We will not be able to stope HIV/AIDS taking a dreadful toll on lives in Papua New  Guinea  but  there  is  hope  of  preventing  a  national  calamity  -  if  the  Papua  New   Guinea  Government  and  the  international  aid  community  take  a  more  active  role   focussed  on  primary  health  care,  promotion  of  safe  sex,  provision  of  condoms  and   better coordinated program delivery” Mr Kerr said   

 Duncan Kerr is a form Dean of the Faculty of Law, University of Papua New Guinea  and has made several visits to the country - most recently three years ago as leader  of  an  International  Commission  of  Jurists  delegation  that  visited  refugee  camps  for   West Papuan asylum seekers in Western Province PNG.
