 Brown Denounces Howard’s Trickery Against Asylum Seekers

 Greens Senator Bob Brown has condemned the Howard Government’s trickery in forcing the removal of the Asylum seeks from the HMAS Manoora.

 “Congratulations to the Nauru Government for ordering a halt to the forced transfer. It is showing the humanity the Howard Government, backed by the Beazley Opposition, lacks,” Senator Brown said.

 “Using military force and trickery is not the solution.

 “Howard and Beazley have got the Manoora into a totally unnecessary bind.

 “Already those on board the Manoora have suffered a great deal. They should be brought to Australia and processed here, ending this costly crisis.

 “While both parties preach the virtues of corporate globalisation, neither party is willingly to accept our share of the global humanitarian problems," Senator Brown said
