 IMMIGRATION MINISTER SIGNS AFGHAN AGREEMENT

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, has signed an agreement with the Interim Administration of Afghanistan on the return of Afghan refugees and asylum seekers.

 “The  agreement  represents  a  mutual  understanding  between  Australia  and Afghanistan for the voluntary return, with dignity and in safety, of Afghans who do not engage Australia's protection obligations,” Mr Ruddock said.

 “So far this year, more than three quarters of a million Afghans have returned from neighbouring  countries,  including  about  600-thousand  under  the  auspices  of  the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

 "These returns are evidence that great progress has been made in Afghanistan but there is still a long way to go. Australia is committed to help assist Afghanistan in its reconstruction.”

 Mr Ruddock met a number of Afghan Government Ministers, including the Chairman of  the  Afghan  Interim  Administration,  Ministers  for  Refugee  Affairs  and  Returnees, Justice, and the acting Foreign Minister.

 They discussed a range of issues including people smuggling, border protection, and the global displacement of millions of Afghans after twenty years of conflict.

 “The Ministers I met emphasised the stability and safety that has been be brought to the  region  and  I  was  able  to  see  the  evidence  of  this  in  moving  around  Kabul,”  Mr Ruddock said.

 The Minister also met with local representatives of  the International Organisation of Migration  and  UNHCR  to  be  briefed  on  the  progress  of  their  local  operations  in repatriating large numbers of Afghans wishing to return home.
