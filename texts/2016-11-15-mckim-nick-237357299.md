 Media Release: Immigration Department reveals gaping holes in US "Deal" 

 November 15, 2016 

 The Department of Immigration and Border Protection has confirmed that the US is not obliged to  accept a particular number of refugees, or indeed any, under the terms of its "deal" with the Australian  government.   

 "We  learned  today  that  the  agreement  provides  no  certainty  whatsoever  for  the  men,  women  and   children that Australia has detained on Manus Island and Nauru," Greens Immigration spokesperson  Senator Nick McKim said.   

 "We also learned that people who are currently in Australia for medical reasons, some of whom have  been victims of assault, will be forced to return to Nauru or Manus Island before being considered for  resettlement in the US."   

 "This is just not acceptable given the trauma it will cause."   

 "The Greens also have serious concerns about the Trump Administration failing to honour this deal  and  leaving  people  stranded,  particularly  given  the  Department's  evidence  today  that  processing   applications will take many months in some cases."   

 "The easiest and most compassionate resolution for the people in offshore detention is to immediately  resettle them in Australia."
