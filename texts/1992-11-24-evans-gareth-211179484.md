  Relief assistance for Mozambicans 

  Australia will provide relief assistance worth approximately $6.6 million for  displaced people in Mozambique and for Mozambican refugees in Malawi, the  Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, announced today. 

  The package includes Australian sorghum, beans, high energy biscuits, yellow  split peas, rice and vegetable oil. It is in addition to drought assistance worth $4.8  million provided to Mozambique earlier this year. 

  "Although the recent peace accord has brought hope for the five million  Mozambicans severely affected by the ten year old civil war, the combined effects  of war and drought have created a situation where mass starvation is a real  possibility," Senator Evans said. 

  "One result of the accord has been the opening up of extra distribution routes, so  that large numbers of previously unreachable people can now receive emergency  supplies. 

  "Furthermore, hundreds of thousands of refugees are expected to begin  returning to Mozambique from Malawi over the coming months. 

  "The assistance will be channelled through Australian non government  organisations and the United Nations." 

  The assistance will be provided as follows:  â¢ $3.8m through World Vision Australia for food aid including Australian  sorghum, beans, vegetable oil and high energy biscuits for Tete province, and for  agriculture and health programs in Tete and Zambezia provinces 

  â¢ $1.7m through CARE Australia to provide Australian vegetable oil to  Maputo, Gaza and Inhambane provinces  â¢ $1.1m through the World Food Programme for Australian yellow split  peas for Mozambican refugees in Malawi. 

  Australian emergency assistance for Mozambicans is administered by AIDAB,  Australia's overseas aid agency.
