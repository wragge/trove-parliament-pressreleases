 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Greens condemn inhumane Malaysian people swap  deal 

 The Australian Greens have condemned the Malaysian Solution reached today which  will involve sending up to 800 people, including unaccompanied children, to an  unknown fate. 

 “Under this deal, the Australian government is shirking its international obligations to  offer protection to those seeking our assistance,” Greens’ immigration spokesperson,  Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, said. 

 “The Greens are doubtful that in reality the rights and protections of 800 vulnerable  people sent by Australia will be any different to the 94,000 asylum seekers already in  Malaysia. 

 “Ultimately these 800 people will be subject to domestic Malaysian law, and we know  these laws do not meet appropriate human rights standards. 

 “We do not support any policy to expel unaccompanied children and families to a  country which has not signed the UN Refugee Convention. 

 “This four-year deal is a waste of Australian taxpayers’ money that would be better  spent increasing our humanitarian intake so 800 people do not have to board boats  before 4,000 refugees are taken from Malaysia. 

 “Both houses of parliament have already condemned this deal, but it can be enacted  because the Immigration Minister does not need parliament’s approval. 

 “Nearly10 years ago the Greens condemned the Pacific Solution. We condemn its  newest version, the Malaysian solution.”
