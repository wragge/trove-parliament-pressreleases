 Senator Andrew Bartlett   Leader of the Australian Democrats     June 20, 2003                   MEDIA RELEASE                                    03/ 443                

 

 Set Children in Detention Free   

 Howard Government moves to keep children locked up in immigration detention centres despite a  landmark court decision that they should be freed was cold-hearted and callous, the Australian  Democrats said today.   

 Democrats’ Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said on United Nations World Refugee Day the  Howard Government had revealed - again - the lengths it would go to, including keeping children  locked up, to try to win political points.    

 “Claims that the Family Court ruling would encourage people smugglers is part of Philip Ruddock  and John Howard’s plans to demonise those people who are fleeing persecution, who are so  desperate to leave their home that they will take enormous risks to get themselves and their children  to safety.   

 “It is a cynical political move to inflame people’s prejudices and fears about refugees.   

 “This Government has done it before and they are doing it again: they are trying to win political  points out of children.”   

 In the wake of yesterday’s historic Family Court decision ruling locking up children indefinitely in  immigration detention centres was illegal, Mr Ruddock today confirmed he would seek a legal  orders preventing the children’s release while the Government was considering an appeal.   

 “On a day such as this, the Minister and the Government have shown just how callous they really  are by disregarding the welfare of children,” Senator Bartlett said.   

 “They are so far out of touch with people on this issue.  All children need to be protected, whether  they were born in Australia or just recently arrived to our country.   

 “The actions of this Minister and Government show protecting children is well down on their list of  priorities.   

 “Their refusal to accept the decision of the Family Court also shows their unwillingness to accept  the national and international law.”
