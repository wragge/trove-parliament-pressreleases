 WORLD FOOD DAY — 16 OCTOBER 1991  Taking Australian tree seeds and skills abroad

 Australia's overseas development cooperation program is playing a valuable  role in taking Australian tree seeds and expertise to the world, the Minister for  Trade and Overseas Development, Neal Blewett, said today.

 Dr Blewett said the theme of today's World Food Day, "Trees for Life"  acknowledged the importance of improved forest management and  conservation.

 "With the world's forests being cleared at the rate of about 18 million hectares a  year it is imperative that steps be taken to promote agro-forestry techniques," Dr  Blewett said. -

 "Many developing countries share similar environmental problems with  Australia, and we are now working together with our regional neighbours to  develop sustainable solutions.

 "Australian tree species, adapted to endure our range of harsh environments, are  playing an increasingly important role in agro-forestry in developing countries.

 "Australian trees are being used for food, fuel, forage, shade, shelter, soil  protection and to reduce pressure on native forests.

 "Australian trees now make up over 40 per cent of all plantations in the tropics  and cover about 10 million hectares of land," Dr Blewett said.

 Over the past two years Australia, mainly through the Australian International  Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB), has provided more than $15 million  for forestry or tree-related projects.

 â¢ The Australian Centre for International Agriculture Research (ACIAR)  provides about $1.7 million per year for forestry research projects in Asia  and Africa.

 â¢ Australia has supported forestry-related projects in Africa, China, Papua  New Guinea and the Pacific, Indonesia, India, Nepal, Thailand and  Vietnam.

 In countries such as Ghana, India, Indonesia, Turkey and Vietnam  Australian food aid, mainly wheat and rice, is used by the World Food  Programme in food for work projects such as reforestation and erosion  control.

 These projects are just part of Australia's overall food aid commitments of  $101.5 million for 1991/92. About $31 million will be used for emergency  and refugee food aid.

 At the multilateral level Australia has supported the Consultative Group  on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) to promote better  management and conservation of the world's natural resources.

 Australia also supports and benefits from international research on agro­ forestry through CGIAR, and ACIAR.

 Australia, through ACIAR and CGIAR, is also involved in establishing the  International Forestry Research Institute.

 AIDAB also supports the work of CSIRO's Australian Trees Centre  through funding tne Seeds of Australian Trees for Developing Countries  project. The Centre dispatches about 15 000 parcels of seeds a year to  researchers in almost 100 countries.

 Research is also being undertaken into the food potential of acacia seeds as  a food source in Africa. The research has involved Australian Aboriginal  people, nutritionists, tree breeders and ethno-botanists.
