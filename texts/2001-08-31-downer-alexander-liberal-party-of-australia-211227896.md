 Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade E and OE

 Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Alexander Downer

 Doorstop, Adelaide, Friday, 31 August 2001

 Topic: MV Tampa situation

 JOURNALIST:

 I understand that perhaps East Timor may be involved now in some way, perhaps processing these refugees that what Australia's asked?

 MINISTER:

 Well, we've been talking to a number of countries, obviously Norway, we've had some discussions with New Zealand, some others, which I won't go into. We've had some discussions with the UN in East Timor as well. I know that a number of the East Timorese leaders would like to play a part in perhaps offering East Timor as a place for processing. But I'm kind of conscious of the fact that East Timor had its general election yesterday which was, by the way, an enormously successful general election, and as it moves now towards establishing a government by the 15th of September and into full independence fairly soon in the early part of next year, that to put this issue partly there in East Timor, even as a processing centre, would, you know, create a fair bit of work for them. So, thats not something that's at the top of our agenda but we have had some discussions with the UN about East Timor and there have been some discussions in East Timor with the East Timorese, ethnic East Timorese leaders, not just with the UN. But we have had good discussions with New Zealand, and a number of other countries, and I'll be talking again today to the Norwegian Foreign Minister. So, we're still working this through, but we've certainly had some useful discussions in the last few days.

 JOURNALIST:

 Whats been the reaction from the UN and the East Timorese to the proposal?

 MINISTER:

 Well, I wouldn't overstate the East Timorese proposal, by the way, and East Timor because of its geography and because it's administered by the United Nations, has been canvassed as a possible place where these people could be processed, processed by the UN, to determine those who are genuine refugees and those who aren't. But I think its a little unlikely that that would be done in East Timor, to tell you the truth, because East Timor's just had their elections and they've been through something of a very successful transition over the last few weeks and they don't really have a formal government in place; that's not likely to be appointed until around the 15th of September. So, there are some complications with East Timor.

 JOURNALIST:

 So, it's not really looking very likely now?

 MINISTER:

 Well, we're having discussions with a number of countries and for some reason or other, somebody has talked about East Timor. I think it would be a gross overstatement for there to be a focus on East Timor, its much less likely to be East Timor than somewhere else.

 JOURNALIST:

 What is the top of the agenda, you mentioned this wasn't at the top of the agenda? What is, in terms of?

 MINISTER:

 I'm sure youd love to know. We just are working progressively through this exercise and naturally enough, and I'm sure youd understand, it's not going to be terribly helpful if we canvass the discussions we've been having too publicly because that will undermine the efficacy of the negotiations. But suffice it to say, I mean, what I will say is that we've had some good discussions with the Norwegians. I mean, there was an acrimo'ious relationship initially; that acrimonious relationship has become more cooperative and constructive. I spoke yesterday with the Norwegian Foreign Minister two or three times, Ill be speaking with him again today. Mrs Clark has made clear that we've been having some discussions with New Zealand as well. There are others weve been talking to in addition to them and we're still working this through.

 JOURNALIST:

 I understand that the Prime Minister has yet to speak directly with Megawati Sukarnoputri. I mean, is that considered at all to be a snub by the Indonesians?

 MINISTER:

 No, not at all. I mean, the situation with Indonesia is that they made it clear right from the outset that they weren't going to take illegals, including the people from this ship. Theyve reinforced that position on many occasions since. I mean, Mr Beazley makes an argument that Australia should be confronting Indonesia and demanding that Indonesia take these people. I have to say to you I think a confrontation with Indonesia over this would be entirely counterproductive. I think if we followed Mr Beazley's hot-headed approach, the consequence of that would be that we would do enormous damage to our relationship with Indonesia and that would make it all the more difficult for us to work through a medium and long-term strategy with Indonesia to fix this problem. Mr Beazley's approach would not persuade the Indonesians to change their mind, because clearly theyre not going to change their mind and they've made that very clear right from the beginning in relation to the Tampa and it would damage any prospects any prospects Australia had of negotiating a medium to long-term agreement with the Indonesians. Now, we're the Government, we have to be responsible, we can't just pursue political stunts of the kind Mr Beazley is proposing. We need to work this through as a broader issue with the Indonesians.

 I'll be visiting Indonesia next week, and Ill be taking with me Mr Ruddock, and well be talking with a number of our counterparts there in Indonesia and that will be an opportunity to build a medium to long-term framework for addressing this problem of illegal people movements and people smuggling. But I do not believe a confrontation with Indonesia is going to be productive and I dont thank Mr Beazley for trying to encourage a confrontation with Indonesia. Indonesias made up its mind; they don't

 want illegals in Indonesia, they want to do everything they can to discourage illegals going to Indonesia. Indonesia is not willing to change its position. I know that from a number of sources, including my discussions with the Foreign Minister, and I think the alternative strategy that we're pursuing is a much more productive approach than the confrontational approach with Indonesia proposed by Mr Beazley.

 JOURNALIST:

 Given that you've had a number of discussions with a number of countries, how close is a resolution?

 MINISTER:

 Well, we're still talking it through. I don't want to get into debating some timeframe. In the meantime, the humanitarian concerns of the people on board the ship are being looked after, they are not in bad condition, and we're obviously ensuring that Australia maintains its humanitarian record in looking after the people on board the ship. But at the same time we're not going to compromise our territorial integrity and we are, unlike the Labor Party, we're not going to do anything which will give any comfort to any illegal people smugglers. We have to be strong, we have to be firm, we have to be determined if we're going to break these illegal people-smuggling rackets. If we follow Mr Beazleys weak lead, then all we'll end up with is a confrontation with Indonesia, and the illegal people-smuggling rackets being given comfort. Thats not the way to go, and that's not what a strong, and determined, and resolute government would ever do.

 JOURNALIST:

 Sorry, just very quickly, on the Bougainville issue, is there any chance we could get just a quick reaction to the signing of the treaty between the rebels and the PNG Government and where to from here?

 MINISTER:

 A truly exciting event, a great thing for Papua New Guinea and Bougainville. I'm very proud of the role that I personally have been able to play and Australia has played. There are problems ahead, there still has to be a resolution of the Papua New Guinea Parliament and thats going to require a bit of work, and the weapons disposal plan put into effect, but I'm optimistic. I think the hardest work is behind us and its a wonderful thing that we've been able to play our part in helping to bring together what constituted a regional civil war.
