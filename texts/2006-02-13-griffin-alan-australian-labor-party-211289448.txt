 Media Release     

 ALAN GRIFFIN MP   Shadow Minister for Veterans’ Affairs   

 13 February 2006   

 LABOR TO RAISE RWANDAN CLASSIFICATION IN  PARLIAMENT    

 

 In Parliament today, Shadow Veterans’ Affairs Minister, Mr Alan Griffin will call on  the Government to fix the failed policy on service classification of Rwanda and  follow Labor’s lead by declaring the mission ‘Warlike’.   

 The service of over 600 ADF peacekeeping personnel who served in Rwanda in  1994 and 1995 is currently classified as ‘Hazardous’, not carrying any benefits  above normal peacetime service. 

 

 These peacekeepers were clearly at risk and experienced the most horrible  circumstances, including life threatening events during the massacre of up to  8,000 men women and children at the Kibeho refugee camp in April 1995.   

 Despite the severe trauma and the danger faced by Australian Peacekeepers in  Rwanda, their service is still not treated as warlike service under the Veterans  Entitlement Act.    

 The motion, moved in the Parliament today by Alan Griffin MP and seconded by  Graham Edwards MP, calls on the Government to:   

 ‘Immediately reclassify this service from ‘hazardous’ to ‘warlike’ in recognition of  the risk faced by these troops and the magnificent contribution they made to the  protection of Rwandan citizens.’  

 

 Any change the Government would wish to make in reclassifying the service of  Rwandan veterans to ‘Warlike’ would be both strongly supported and warmly  welcome by Labor.
