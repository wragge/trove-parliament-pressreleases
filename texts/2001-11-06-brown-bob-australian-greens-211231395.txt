 Liberal, Labor Bar on Free Speech Faces Meltdown: Brown

 Greens Stand Has Multi-partisan Backing

 Greens Senator Bob Brown says the bar on Liberal and Labor candidates speaking out over asylum seekers will be followed by a full on debate and back down by both the Liberal and Labor parties after the election.

 "Both big parties are guilty of shoring up their increasingly unpopular policies on asylum seekers and the war in Afghanistan by gagging candidates for parliament who have a more humane viewpoint. There will be a total revision of policy after the election. It is coming," Senator Brown said today.

 "The big parties are rushing about stemming the haemorrhage of free speech in their ranks but this shows that candidates across the board support the Greens stand for more humane treatment of asylum seekers. It has multi-partisan backers," he said.

 "For each person who has been silenced in the campaign there will be 10 who will call for a policy review on 11th November. The Greens will help foster this debate for a more mature and responsible response to asylum seekers who will be brought ashore and processed in Australia," Senator Brown said.

 "Both Mr Howard and Mr Beazley have the ice of their asylum seekers policy melting under their feet," he said.

 "After November 11th, there will be a total meltdown. It will be a healthy thing for Australia," Senator Brown concluded.
