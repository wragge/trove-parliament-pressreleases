 Senator Andrew Bartlett Leader of the Australian Democrats Spokesperson for Immigration

 17TH October 2002 MEDIA RELEASE      02/494

 Pacific Solution is no solution The Australian Democrats oppose the latest misuse of our resources on the so-called ‘Pacific Solution’ with the decision of the Federal Government to continue the processing of refugee claims on Manus Island for another twelve months.

 Democrats’ Leader and spokesperson for Immigration, Senator Andrew Bartlett said, “ The past year has proven that this policy has been a waste of taxpayers money and Government resources, including military and intelligence resources.

 “The lack of medical facilities at Manus Island has resulted in people having to be transported to Australia for treatment, and the lack of educational and religious facilities for detainees is an ongoing concern,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “The lack of transparency and scrutiny of conditions has meant that allegations of human rights abuses cannot be adequately investigated.

 “Asylum seekers are left in a legal limbo with no ability to seek redress under any legal system.

 “Even those eventually recognised as genuine refugees are not automatically granted a visa to Australia. Instead they may be left waiting indefinitely on Manus Island until a third country offers to take them.

 “We are obliged to protect genuine refugees. Leaving them on islands for months or years at a time with no resolution and no certain future is inhumane and in breach of our obligations under international law.

 “This was a shameful policy when it was introduced. The Government has ignored the large amount of evidence gathered by Government and independent inquiries into detention and the wider ‘Pacific Solution’.

 “Not only is the ‘Pacific Solution’ expensive, we are in breach of our obligations under international law and at risk of causing long term mental health damage to people by pursuing this policy.

 “It’s time our military intelligence resources were directed towards detecting terrorists, not stopping refugees. The ‘Pacific Solution’ must be scrapped.

 “Using Pacific islands to keep refugees out of Australia is not, and never will be, a solution,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
