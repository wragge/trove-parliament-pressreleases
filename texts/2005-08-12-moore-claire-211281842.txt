  AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY 

  * Senator Claire Moore Labor Senator for Queensland National Conference on Human Rights and Mental Health Senator Claire Moore from Queensland will be hosting the third National Conference on Mental Health and Human Rights in Contemporary Australia at Parliament House in Canberra on Thursday 8, Friday 9 September 2005. Senator Claire Moore said she was delighted to be hosting the conference and congratulates SAVE Australia for highlighting the often neglected issues of mental health and human rights. “The conference will emphasise that human rights impose obligations on governments to implement policies that provide all persons with the opportunity to be healthy. Currently Government are not fulfilling their obligations and have failed to recognise and understand the important link between mental health issues and international human rights.” Some of the speakers at the conference include Dr Sev Ozdowski OAM Human Rights and Disability Discrimination Commissioner; Patrick Dodson; Dr Carmen Lawrence MP; Bishop Patrick Power, Auxiliary Bishop of Canberra; Margo Kingston from the Sydney Morning Herald; Jennifer Burn, Human Rights lawyer; Ms Julia Gillard MP, Shadow Minister for Health; Senator Jan McLucas, Shadow Minister for Ageing and Disability; Andrew Bartlett, Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats; and many other high profile activists form the mental health and human rights arena. Senator Moore said that In addition to refugee and adolescent mental health, the conference will be addressing the state of indigenous mental health. “Having worked in Indigenous Affairs and recently chaired the Senate Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs, it i s  obvious that indigenous mental health in Australia needs immediate attention. Unfortunately, Australia s t i l l  has no nationally agreed guidelines on the assessment and management of indigenous mental health issues. Currently the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health i s  looking at mental health issues across the country. The submissions and evidence reflect the personal experience and pain of people living with mental health issues. “Finally we have a forum where the issues of mental health and human rights can be considered in the wider community. I anticipate an insightful and frightfully realistic analysis of these issues and eagerly await the opportunity to discuss them with conference participants said Senator Moore.
