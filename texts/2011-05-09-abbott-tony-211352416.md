 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR,  JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH THE HON. BRUCE BILLSON MHR,  SHADOW MINISTER FOR SMALL BUSINESS, COMPETITION POLICY AND  CONSUMER AFFAIRS, 

  QUEANBEYAN

 E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It’s good to be here at Skyview Windows. I want to thank Neil and Rachel Thompson for making us so  welcome. It’s good to be here with Bruce Billson, my extremely enthusiastic and effective Shadow Minister  for Small Business.    

 The carbon tax will have a significant impact on this business. It’s typical of so many small businesses in the  sense that they have a power bill of about $16,000 a year. Under a carbon tax that will go up by about  $4,000 and that’s just a $4,000 hit on their bottom line. But in the case of this particular business it’s not just  the immediate uncompensated impact of the carbon tax on their electricity bills, it’s also the impact on their  suppliers because their main suppliers are aluminium and glass makers here in Australia and a carbon tax  will almost certainly drive aluminium making and glass making offshore.    

 The whole point of a carbon tax is to make energy intensive activities more expensive so we have less  energy intensive activities here in Australia. That doesn’t mean that we will be using less steel, less  aluminium, less cement, less chemicals and less glass, it just means that we’ll be importing all of these vital  sinews of a modern economy from countries like China. So not only will this business be immediately  damaged by a carbon tax but all of the suppliers will be gravely damaged, if not destroyed, by a carbon tax.  So if this business survives it’ll be using imported aluminium and imported glass.   

 Now, obviously tomorrow night is the budget night. All the indications are that this will be a budget with a  hole in its heart because it won’t include the carbon tax, even though the carbon tax is at least the biggest tax  change since the GST. I say to the Government it is not too late to pulp the document and to reproduce it  with the carbon tax in it, because let’s face it the Treasury has done the modelling and it could be and should  be included, and without the carbon tax in it this budget will not be worth the paper that it is printed on. It  will be a completely misleading and incomplete document. The revenue forecasts will be wrong. The  expenditure forecasts will be wrong. The inflation forecasts will be wrong. The growth forecasts will be  wrong. A private company that put out financial statements as materially misleading and incomplete as this  budget will be without the carbon tax would face prosecution and wouldn’t be allowed to list. That’s what a

 dud document the Treasurer is going to produce for the Australian people tomorrow night if the carbon tax is  not included.   

 Now, I’m going to ask Bruce to say a few words then we’ll take some questions.   

 BRUCE BILLSON:   

 Thanks Tony. This is a business that is at the pointy end of the carbon tax debate. It needs to be world class  every day because its competition that it is up against coming in from China won’t be burdened with the  carbon tax, yet this business will. So in the document, the budget documents released, businesses like this  small business and many others around Australia want to know what it means for them. Without the carbon  tax detail in there this is a budget with the detail of a crayon drawing, which isn’t enough comfort for  businesses like this who want to know about their future and what the impact it will have on their viability,  on their employees and on the communities they support.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, you said that under the carbon tax because of aluminium and glass the inputs this company  would end up having to buy from offshore. That’s not strictly true, is it? We don’t know the detail of the  package so for all we know there’ll be enough protection for those sectors in Australia that they won’t fail.  Isn’t that right?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 But we do know that the whole point of a carbon tax is to make energy intensive activities more expensive. I  mean. The whole theory of a carbon tax is you make energy intensive activities more expensive so you have  less of them. But the problem is we’re not going to use less steel, less aluminium, less cement, less glass,  fewer chemicals. We’re not going to use less of this because these are all the essential sinews of a modern  first world economy; we’re just going to import them, import them from places that don’t have a carbon tax.   

 QUESTION:   

 The question was about the viability of those industries in Australia and the Government says that if those  are subject to adequate compensation it won’t happen. So do you know something that we don’t or you just  don’t believe it?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 The thing about this Government is the compensation promises are about as believable as Julia Gillard’s  promise before the election that “there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.” I mean, you can  take nothing this Government says seriously because let’s face it this whole Government is a government  based on a lie, the lie that there would be “no carbon tax under a government I lead.” Now, you know, the  fundamental point about compensation is that this Government has already over-promised the compensation.  One minute households are going to be 100 per cent compensated; then they’re not. I mean, the fact of the  matter is you cannot fully compensate people for the impact of this bad tax and you certainly can’t  compensate anyone for losing his or her job, which is what the impact of this tax will be on so many  industries and so many jobs right across the country.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, would you support the Government bringing in 16,000 skilled migrants?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 3 

 

 I think that what the Government has done over the last three years is make it much more difficult for  Australian businesses to bring in workers under the well proven 457 visa scheme. The 457 visa scheme has  been gravely damaged by union inspired bureaucracy and red tape, and that’s the reason why… one of the  reasons why we have a significant shortage of skilled workers in the country now.   

 QUESTION:   

 So you’d welcome more?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, I say that what the Government should do is stop mucking up the 457 visa scheme. I mean, the great  thing about the 457 visa scheme is that it meant that particular businesses took particular workers for  particular jobs who they could employ tomorrow. It was a very good scheme put in place by the Howard  Government. It was a very good way of responding to skills shortages here in Australia and this  Government’s mucking it up.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, as soon the Government gets a more favourable Senate it will get through its means test on the  health insurance rebate which you oppose. Do you feel strongly enough about this to reverse that decision in  government?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 We’ve always said that one of the big differences between the Coalition and the Labor Party is that we fully  support choice in healthcare and they don’t. Now, this is typical of the kind of class war cuts that we’re  going to get from this Government in the budget. There’ll be no serious restructuring, there’ll be no tough  spending cuts but what there will be will be a tax on people who aspire to a better life and one of the signs of  aspiring to a better life for your family, for your children is taking out private health insurance.   

 QUESTION:   

 So would you reverse it in government?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Our position has always been - and as far as I’m concerned always will be - we support private health  insurance and we don’t support means testing the private health insurance rebate.   

 QUESTION:   

 So, that’s a yes?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It’s what I said it is, Michelle. I mean, let’s see what the Government actually does tomorrow night before  we make definitive answers but it is our clear, definitive, unambiguous, unquestioned policy to support the  private health insurance rebate. We support it un-means tested in opposition, we’d support it un-means  tested in government.    

 QUESTION:   

 4 

 

 Just on the Malaysian deal that, as you know, is to accept 1000 refugees a year for four years so if you  became Prime Minister in a couple of years what would you do? Would you honour the agreement or would  you walk right away from it straight away?    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well again, we don’t have an agreement. We just don’t have an agreement. I mean, this is a Government  which every day comes up with a new announcement and none of the announcements are fully thought  through and none of the announcements have proceeded to a conclusion. I mean, let’s face it, it was only 72  hours ago that their solution was a new detention centre in Manus and we’ve heard nothing about that in the  last 48 hours because they’ve come up with yet another gimmick which is the people swap with Malaysia,  the people-go-round with Malaysia. Now, there is only one way to sort out this problem and that’s to go  back to the policies that worked, the policies that the Coalition supports. That’s Nauru, Manus, temporary  protection visas and a willingness to turn boats around where it’s safe to do so.   

 QUESTION:   

 The signs are from the Malaysian PM that it will go ahead; they’ve just got to nut out the details. So, what  would you do if you became prime minister?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, you say they’ve just got to nut out the details. That’s the whole point. That’s the whole point of it.  They haven’t nutted out the details. It’s just another panicked, desperate thought bubble from a Government  which is literally drowning in problems of its own making.   

 QUESTION:   

 Do you have concerns about asylum seekers being sent?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, that’s a very good point because the whole justification for the Prime Minister refusing to pick up the  phone to the President of Nauru is that Nauru is not a signatory to the UN convention. Now, Malaysia’s not  a signatory to the UN convention. Now, you know, I’m not going to get into casting aspersions on the  Malaysians and how they run things but if Nauru was unacceptable because it’s not a signatory to the UN  convention how can Malaysia be acceptable now? It just goes to show that this is a Prime Minister who  believes nothing and everything; who is against something one day, for something the next day. There is no  conviction, no commitment and no consistency from this Prime Minister which is…   

 QUESTION:   

 Are you saying that you do not and will not support the Malaysian solution?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I’m saying there is no Malaysian solution. There is no Malaysian solution. Let’s see the Malaysian solution  and then you can ask us that question.   

 QUESTION:   

 The United Nations has been positive about this deal, in-principle deal though, so doesn’t that show that this  isn’t like the Pacific Solution because the UN was critical of the Pacific Solution.   

 5 

 

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 The fact is this is an appalling deal for Australia. It’s an absolutely appalling deal for Australia.   

 QUESTION:   

 That wasn’t my question though. My question was doesn’t it show that this is not like the Pacific Solution?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 And my answer is that this is an appalling deal for Australia. I’m interested in Australia. I mean, I would  like to be the prime minister of Australia and my interest is in the best deal for Australia and that should be  Prime Minister Gillard’s interest. Her interests should be in the best deal for Australia. Now, the problem  with this deal is that for every one that they take we take five of theirs and we pay for the whole lot. I mean,  we are just haemorrhaging cash because the Prime Minister is too proud to pick up the phone to the  President of Nauru because if we were to send illegal boat arrivals to Nauru there’d be no question of  bringing people back from Nauru because there aren’t any currently on Nauru.
