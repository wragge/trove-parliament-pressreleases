 TITLE:  Doorstop Interview : Spring Street, Melbourne : Zimbabwe, Khalid Sheikh  Mohammed, and Sri Lankan Asylum Seekers 

 

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: I just want to say something about Zimbabwe and Khalid  Shaikh Mohammed.  

 In relation to Zimbabwe, we have, as I said two days ago, and let me repeat it, we have been  quite appalled at the treatment of Opposition figures. Our ambassador in Harare visited  Morgan Tsvangirai, the Leader of the Opposition, and also other Opposition figures in, first of  all, in prison, and subsequently in hospital last night. And he reports that they have been badly  beaten.  

 This kind of abuse is unacceptable to the international community. Australia is a country that  helped during the time of Malcolm Fraser's Government, and Malcolm Fraser in particular,  helped to bring about constitutional change in Zimbabwe. Australia helped to make a  democratic Zimbabwe possible. And this democracy has now been grotesquely abused by 

 President Mugabe.  

 I have spoken today to the charge d'affaire of Zimbabwe in Canberra, and I've explained to  him that, it's not just the Australian Government or the Australian Parliament, but the  Australian people are deeply upset at what has happened in Zimbabwe.  

 I told him that our statistics show that 80 per cent of people in his country are unemployed  and living in poverty; 80 per cent of them. That Zimbabwe has the world's worst life  expectancy rate.  

 So this is a country that has been trashed by President Mugabe.  

 I've said that we will strongly support the United Nati... any action in the United Nations  Human Rights Council which is in session at the moment in Geneva to address the problem of  Zimbabwe, and for the United Nations Human Rights Council, I hope, this will be a bit of a  test of its relevance, if it can produce a resolution condemning what's happened in Zimbabwe.  

 Finally, I think, if you want to solve the problem of Zimbabwe internationally, you have to  lean on the other countries in the region. I think South Africa, other neighbours and near  neighbours like Nigeria, they do have to carry the bulk of the charge against this regime. By 

 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 2

 that, I mean diplomatic charge against this regime, a bit analogous with China and North  Korea. So we will be talking to the South Africans and others about our hopes for them doing  even more than they have been doing to address the problem of Zimbabwe.  

 And just finally, on Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, I notice that he's made a series of confessions.  One of his confessions are concerned mainly about 9/11. But one of his confessions is that he  had involvement in the Bali bombing. Eight-eight Australians were killed in the Bali  bombing.  

 I'm delighted that he is in Guantanamo Bay, and I'm delighted that he's facing justice, because  people who aid and abet terrorists or who are terrorists, they should face justice.  

 Terrorism is a shocking thing. And what Khalid Shaikh Mohammed has done is truly  deplorable. And I think all Australians should be reminded, through these confessions by  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, of the importance of us being determined to fight the scourge of 

 terrorism so that we don't see a repeat of what we saw in Bali, and of course, 9/11 a few years  ago.  

 QUESTION: Minister, how can we be absolutely certain that these confessions are kosher,  given that independent lawyers and journalists weren't allowed in, and all we've got is a  transcript.  

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: We got a bit more than a transcript. We got a good deal of  additional corroborating information provided to us by a number of other governments  including, by the way, the Indonesian Government in relation to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed's  involvement in the Bali bombing.  

 Look, there are two lines of dealing with this. One is, there is a role for the lawyers. And the  lawyers can make all sorts of claims and lodge all sorts of appeals and do all sorts of things.  But secondly, there's commonsense. And the commonsense reveals this man to be one of the  terrorist masterminds. And the international community, not just the Americans, the  international community have to be determined to confront these people and deal with these  people.  

 Personally, I just think it's completely wrong to be trying to find excuses or apolo... you  know, apologising for the likes of this type of person.  

 I think he's right where I want to see him, in Guantanamo Bay.  

 QUESTION: Isn't there a bit of a concern when there's some things in the actual confession  like, I planned the September 11 attacks from A to Z, which is a very sort of American style  of talking. And perhaps not something that he would say.  

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well, I think... put it the other way around to you. I think any  suggestion that the Americans have arrested someone here for a speeding offence and decided  to trump up charges about him being involved in terrorism, I think that sort of claim is  completely absurd.  

 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 3

 We have all sorts of information about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, not just a confessional  statement. All sorts of information about his activities. This is a truly evil person. And I think  in the end... put it to you this way. I'm not accusing you, by the way, not even for a second of  this. But just because he has been captured by the Americans, and is in the detention of the  Americans, doesn't mean that he is somehow somebody we should turn into a poster boy in  our t... you know, sort of rant against the Americans.  

 I look at it entirely the other way around. I'm absolutely delighted that the Americans have got  this person, and I'm absolutely delighted that he's in Guantanamo Bay.  

 QUESTION: Does what he said about links with JI confirm what you already know?  

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Yes. I mean, in general, absolutely, yes.  

 QUESTION: And are you concerned... I mean, you're obviously quite happy that he's in  Guantanamo Bay. But for the purposes of showing that you're going to be above board and  put him on trial, is there any concern that he's being held in a place like that, and potentially  go on trial in a place like that, rather than being in more of an open court where everybody 

 can see what he has done fully and clearly?  

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: The Australian Government's not going to complain about the  procedures that are taking place in relation to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. This is an evil guy.  And the Americans are tough on him. Good. I think they're right to be.  

 I mean, you can't on the one hand say, tut tut, I'm not much in favour of terrorism, but gee, I'm  going to go out on a limb and campaign for Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. I mean, to be honest  with you, if you want to defeat terrorists, you've got to be tough with them. I mean, look what 

 they have done to our people.  

 I went up to Bali, and I saw the remains of 88 Australians. I was with their families. I know  exactly what the consequences of Bali were.  

 Not a bit of a theory, not just something in a history book for me. It's something that I've seen  with my own eyes. And that has hardened my resolve against these terrorists. It really has.  

 QUESTION: And Guantanamo Bay is the best approach for justice?  

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well, that's where he is. I mean, you know, whatever the  complaints about Guantanamo Bay, my heart doesn't bleed for a man who confesses to be  responsible for, or at least partly responsible for, a range of utterly odious atrocities. He's in  Guantanamo Bay. It's a high-security facility. Conditions in Guantanamo Bay are consistent,  I'm told, with conditions in high-security prisons in Western countries, including the United  States.  

 QUESTION: He's said to be involved in 29 acts or potential acts of terror.  

 Just how significant is this confession?  

 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 4

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well it is significant. But of course, we have known for a long  time about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. So this doesn't all come as a great revelation to us.  We've obviously got a good deal of information about him and his activities.  

 QUESTION: Is there anything in the information that he's provided that would lead  Australia to revise its strategy on terrorism?  

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Not at the moment, no, because what he has said is not  particular news to us.  

 Okay.  

 QUESTION: Can we just ask you a bit more about Zimbabwe.  

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Yeah.  

 QUESTION: What do you think can be done practically? We know that Mugabe's record is  that he will ignore anything that comes from the UN.  

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Yeah.  

 QUESTION: He's likely to ignore pressu... 

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: We have trouble getting things through the UN, by the way.  

 QUESTION: Yeah. Is there... but is there anything practical that can be done?  

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Look, I was at the UN and saying in an interview on The World  Today some time ago, but it was in September last year.  

 I was in a... at the general assembly at the UN. And Robert Mugabe was making a speech as I  was walking by. Well, I chose not to stay for the speech. I didn't want to hear what Robert  Mugabe had to say. But I was taken aback by the number of people who rose to their feet and  applauded his speech at the end of it.  

 The fact is that there are a lot of countries - whether a majority or not is another question - but  there are a lot of countries in the UN that would not be prepared to take any action against  Zimbabwe. A lot.  

 I think we will struggle in the human rights council to get a resolution condemning Zimbabwe  and what has happened there. But an effort is being made.  

 But ultimately, the countries that have the greatest leverage are the neighbouring countries in  southern Africa, particularly South Africa itself. Not the UN. Not the UN's Human Rights  Council or the general assembly, and probably not even the Security Council.  

 But on the other hand, you wouldn't get much of a resolution through the Security Council,  even if you tried.

 QUESTION: One of the countries that an Opposition leader last night singled out for  Australia to lean on is India. Are you aware of that?  

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: I saw that, yeah.  

 QUESTION:  Yes.   

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Yes. He was... and I've met him on a couple of occasions. His  argument is using India is an argument about how best you can, you know, leverage the  Commonwealth in this case. But, I mean, I'm sympathetic to that, and we're happy to talk to  the Indians about it.  

 But we did go down the Commonwealth route when Zimbabwe was a member of the  Commonwealth, and very effectively. Australia was the chair of the Commonwealth. We had  Zimbabwe suspended from the Commonwealth at the Coolum Heads Of Government  Meeting in 2002.  

 And subsequently, we got the suspension renewed; and Zimbabwe them resigned from the  Commonwealth. So Zimbabwe is no longer a member of the Commonwealth. So that's a  problem. I mean, the Commonwealth options have... to be realistic about it, have been largely 

 exhausted. Except that it's nice, from time to time, for the Commonwealth to make the  appropriate strong statements. And I know that Don McKinnon, the secretary general, has  done that.  

 QUESTION: In the past, Mbeki hasn't been quite as forthright against the Zimbabweans as I  daresay that many people would like.  

 Do you think that this latest attack on Morgan Tsvangirai and his fellow Opposition  supporters might turn public opinion in South Africa? And that's, obviously, what you're  suggesting is where you're going to need the help most. 

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Yeah. It is where we need the help most. And look, you know,  it's not going to get us anywhere attacking the South Africans. But I've respected the South  African approach, which is that they want to talk quietly with President Mugabe. They don't  think there'll be any [indistinct] happened in the past thought there was any virtue in taking  too public a stand on this issue. I respect that. But the fact is, the situation in Zimbabwe is  getting progressively worse, not better. It's getting a good deal worse.  

 And now might be an opportunity for South Africa to consider some other tactical and  strategic moves in terms of approaching this issue. So... of a diplomatic kind. So we hope so.  And we'll be talking to them about it.  

 QUESTION: Do you actually fear for the life of Opposition politicians given the situation  there at the moment, and what Mugabi said about not... he's not prepared to take any  criticism?  

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: I fear for the lives of Opposition politicians and many other  people in Zimbabwe. Anybody who opposes the regime doe... demonstrates tremendous 

 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 6

 courage. They really do. And I admire the courage that so many of those people have shown.  And you can see. They've been beaten up. And very solidly beaten up. And so I do fear for  their lives. But I think as the MDC has said, the Opposition will be helped by the international  community.  

 And I don't just mean Australia and Britain and America. The broader international  community, they will be protected by the broader international community, subjecting the  Mugabe regime to greater scrutiny, and a good deal more diplomatic pressure.  

 QUESTION: Can we just ask on the Sri Lankans.  

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Yeah.  

 QUESTION: Are we any closer to a decision, a final decision from Indonesia?  

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well look. We... not a final decision from Indonesia. But Kevin  Andrews and I think that it's going to be simpler to transfer them to Nauru. I think that is  going to be the simplest solution. But the Indonesians, it's... you know, it's complicated work  to put together packages that would involve processing by the United Nations. They're  consistent with our obligations under the refugee convention. So I think, to be honest with  you, the simplest solution here is to transfer them to Nauru.  

 QUESTION: And is it correct that if they are found to be refugees, that they might not be  brought to Australia?  

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: If they're found not to be refugees...?  

 QUESTION: No, if they're found to be refugees.  

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Oh, found to be refugees, they certainly won't be brought to  Australia if they're found not be refugees; they'll be sent back to Sri Lanka. If they're found to  be refugees, well, they'll be resettled. And so we'll have to look at that, cross that bridge if and  when we come to it.  

 [Ends]
