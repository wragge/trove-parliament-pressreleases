 media release 

 Welcome home Vivian  18.11.05 

 

 Australian  Greens  Senator  Kerry  Nettle  joined  with  thousands  of   Australians to welcome Vivian Solon on her return to Australia this  morning.    

 “I  am  very  pleased  that  after  nearly  four  and  half  years  in  the   Philippines, Vivian has returned home,” Senator Nettle said.   

 “Vivian  should  have  been  home  with  her  children  four  and  a  half   years ago.  The Government’s cruel and inept deportation and then  ‘hard  ball’  approach  to  working  out  her  care  package  has  been   disgraceful.    

 “I have not seen any evidence that the Department of Immigration  will not repeat this horror story again.    

 “With ongoing hunger strikes in Villawood Detention Centre, fires in  Baxter and asylum seekers being held incommunicado in Darwin it  is clear that the Government’s efforts to convince the public that the   Department  of  Immigration  has  undergone  cultural  change  have  a   long way to go.   

 “Vivian  Solon’s  case  sets  a  new  standard  for  lack  of  Ministerial   accountability in Australian politics.   

 “As  Vivian  returns  home,  Minister  Vanstone  should  be  finding  a   new job,” Senator Nettle said.
