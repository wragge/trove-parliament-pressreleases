 MEDIA RELEASE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER FA139            13  October  2004  

 

 DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT: AMBASSADOR TO THAILAND   

 I have today announced the appointment of Bill Paterson PSM as Australia’s Ambassador to  Thailand.  Mr Paterson will replace Miles Kupa who has been Ambassador since November  2000.  Mr Paterson is expected to take up his  appointment in January 2005.   

 Australia's relations with Thailand are at a high point, following the visit to Australia in July  2004 of Prime Minister Thaksin and nine of his Cabinet Ministers, the joint meeting of Prime  Ministers  and  Ministers  from  both  countries  and  the  signature  of  the  historic  Thailand-Australia  Free  Trade  Agreement.   TAFTA  represents  a  watershed  in  bilateral  relations,  will   further  strengthen  trade  and  investment  flows  and  links  Australia  with  South  East  Asia’s   second largest and fastest growing economy.    

 Bilateral relations are close and mature and span close cooperation in areas such as counter-terrorism, transnational crime, defence, education, civil aviation and tourism.  The extent and  mutual  value  of  such  cooperation  was  underlined,  for  example,  by  the  joint  service  of  our   forces in East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq, and Thailand’s close cooperation with Australia  in  the  fight  against  terrorism,  narcotics  and  people  smuggling.   This  cooperation  is  set  to   expand  following  the  signature  of  TAFTA  and  a  treaty-level  Agreement  on  Bilateral   Cooperation.    

 People-to-people  exchanges  between  the  two  countries  are  also  significant,  with  Australia   being the preferred destination for Thais studying abroad.  In 2003, some 50,000 Thais visited  or studied in Australia, while 300,000 Australians visited Thailand.     

 Mr Paterson is a senior career officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and is  currently First Assistant Secretary, South and South-East Asia Division. He has been closely  involved  in  international  strategic  and  security  policy,  politico-military  affairs,  intelligence   and  regional  issues  as  a  senior  government  official.   He  was  head  of  the  Australian   Government’s  Iraq  Task  Force  (2002-03)  and  Head  of  the  Anti-Terrorism  Task  Force   following the events of September 11, 2001.   

 Mr Paterson served as Chief of Staff and Principal Adviser to the Foreign Minister (2000) and  as  Assistant  Secretary  for  Asia,  APEC  and  Trade  policy  in  the  Department  of  the  Prime   Minister  and  Cabinet  (1998-99)  during  both  the  Asian  financial  crisis  and  the  East  Timor   Crisis.  Mr Paterson has also worked on global issues for the Office of National Assessments.   

 Overseas, Mr Paterson has served in Dhaka, Baghdad, Vienna, Washington and Tokyo.  He  has also served on the Boards of the Fulbright Commission, the Centre for American Studies  and is a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Management.   

 Mr Paterson was educated at the University of Melbourne and holds a Bachelor of Arts degree  with Honours.  He was awarded the Public Service Medal in the 2004 Australia Day Honours  List.  He is married with three children.
