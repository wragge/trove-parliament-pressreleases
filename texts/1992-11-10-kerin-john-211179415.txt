 Australian relief aid worth more than $15m for Horn of Africa

 Australia will provide emergency aid worth more than $15 million for people affected by drought and conflict in the Horn of Africa, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, John Kerin, announced today.

 "The package includes $10m for Australian wheat, wheat flour, high energy biscuits, cooking oil, beans and associated transport costs. Health and agricultural programs will also receive support," Mr Kerin said.

 "Our aid will be distributed by Australian non government organisations and United Nations agencies working in the Horn of Africa."

 "Civil conflicts and ethnic rivalries in the region have escalated, particularly in southern Sudan. The situation has been aggravated by worsening drought which is spreading to cover most of eastern and southern Africa," Mr Kerin said.

 "People have continued to flee across national boundaries, creating further problems for the relief effort because of lack of security and difficulties in gaining access to different groups.

 "The United Nations has stressed the importance of taking a regional approach whilst bearing in mind the specific needs of individual countries."
