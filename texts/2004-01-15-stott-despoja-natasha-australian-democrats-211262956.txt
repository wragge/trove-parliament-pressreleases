 Australian Democrats Press  Releases

 Senator Natasha Stott Despoja Democrats Senator for South Australia

 Dated: 15 April 2005

 Press Release Number: 05/181

 Portfolio: Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

 Release Peter Qasim Now

 The Australian Democrats have condemned reports that long term detainee, Peter Qasim, will  not be eligible immediately for the Governments new bridging visa.

 Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, Senator for South Australia, who visited Mr Qasim in Baxter  Detention Centre last week, said Mr Qasim is suited to this kind of visa, having been refused  refugee status by the Australian Government and prevented from returning to his country of  origin, India. 

 The visa, announced by the Government last month, is aimed at asylum seekers who have  been denied refugee status and rejected by their country of origin. 

 Why the delaying tactics by the Immigration Minister? asked Senator Stott Despoja.

 Mr Qasim has been languishing in detention, waiting for resolution to his situation for more than  six years. Without this visa, he faces the prospect of being detained in Australia indefinitely. 

 Why is Mr Qasim not being granted this visa which appears to be tailor-made for his situation?

 Originally from Kashmir, Mr Qasim is in his seventh year in detention in Australia. He has been  rejected by the Australian Government as a refugee and has been eligible for deportation,  however, the Indian Government refuses to recognise him. Consequently, Mr Qasim is in limbo. 

 I urge the Government to immediately review this case and grant, at least, a temporary visa to  Peter Qasim to allow him to live in the community instead of prolonging this soul-destroying  experience as a detainee. Senator Stott Despoja said.
