 Statement Re Bakhtiyari Family

 VPS 150/2004

 Minister for Immigration, Amanda Vanstone, today commented on continuing speculation in the media and elsewhere regarding the  nationality of the Bakhtiyari family.

 The Minister noted that the Afghan Embassy had today advised that Mrs Bakhtiyari’s nationality, from an Afghan perspective, needs  further investigation and remains ‘inconclusive.’

 ‘The Australian Government has been in close consultation with the Afghan authorities throughout this year in order to explore the  various claims made about Afghan connections in relation to Mrs Bakhtiyari,’ the Minister said.

 ‘It is important to note however that this does not change in any way the outcome of decisions relating to the Bakhtiyari family.

 ‘It has been established that Australia does not owe the family refugee protection.

 ‘The central issue is clear: it is beyond doubt that the family are Pakistani nationals and can go there safely at any time.

 ‘The Government has written confirmation from the Pakistani authorities that Mr Bakhtiyari, Mrs Bakhtiyari and the children are all  Pakistani nationals. This puts the matter beyond doubt.

 ‘From the start of this whole process, in relation to Mrs Bakhtiyari, there have been serious doubts about her claims as to her  nationality. The Refugee Review Tribunal took the unprecedented step of seriously questioning her credibility.

 ‘Mrs Bakhtiyari refused to cooperate with my department in July 2003, when it sought her assistance to establish the veracity of her  claims to be Afghani.

 ‘The family’s previous claims regarding the need for protection from Afghanistan now need to be viewed against the family’s current  desire to return there.

 ‘The family, all of whom arrived in Australia unlawfully, has never been frank with the Australian Government about their background  and circumstances and has refused to cooperate with efforts to firmly clarify these matters.

 ‘Even if there is doubt about where Mrs Bakhtiyari originally came from - at most ‘inconclusive’, there is no doubt about her current  status.

 ‘This family has tested their claims to remain in Australia, including their identity, in 20 separate legal actions. Those connected to the  family may wish to re-hear their case through the media. That is not the appropriate forum. The primary decision, the Refugee Review  Tribunal and the courts have already determined the status of the family.

 Beyond this statement I do not intend to canvass the details of this family's case publicly.
