 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 5 September 2014   

 Hamid Kehazaei care not ‘outstanding’,  Manus must close   

 It is absurd of the Immigration Minister to claim that 24 year old asylum seeker Hamid Kehazaei  received ‘outstanding’ care while his family grapple with the question of when to turn off his life  support machines, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “This is a dreadful decision for any family to have to make and my thoughts are with them at this  difficult time,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Hamid should never have been put in harm’s way like this and there now needs to be a  thorough, independent medical examination of the Manus Island detention camp.   

 “Scott Morrison says Hamid received ‘outstanding’ care on Manus Island. Well, if ‘outstanding’  care on Manus Island sees someone die because of a cut foot, it needs to be shut down.   

 “Reports that the Immigration Department had refused to facilitate the family’s travel to  Australia, so that they could be with him when he passes away, are concerning. If this is true, it  shows the appalling lack of care from this government and the Minister.   

 “Hamid is the second victim of the Manus Island detention camp and it must be closed  immediately.”
