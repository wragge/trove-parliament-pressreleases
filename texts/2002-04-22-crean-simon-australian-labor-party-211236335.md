 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY    EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY

 SPEECH BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THE HON SIMON CREAN MP THE BAKER AND MCKENZIE AUSTRALIA IN ASIA SERIES ‘AUSTRALIA AND ASIA: NEW PARTNERSHIPS, NEW DIRECTIONS’

 22nd APRIL 2002

 Professor Stephen FitzGerald Members of the Asia-Australia Institute Distinguished Guests Ladies and Gentlemen

 In the five months since becoming the Opposition Leader I have delivered a number  of  speeches  setting  out  Labor  directions  on  issues  such  as modernizing  the  parliament,  modernizing  the  Labor  Party,  developing  a comprehensive  immigration,  population  and  refugee  policy,  and  supporting paid  maternity  leave  and  improvements  to  the  living  wage  for  working families.

 The  direction  I  want  to  spell  out  tonight  is  a  foreign  policy  of  engagement with the Asian region.

 Australia needs a new plan for regional engagement.

 And we need to build a new partnership with the international community.

 It’s  an  important statement about the  direction  in  which  I  want  to  lead the Party.

 This direction needs to be built around three important partnerships.

 â¢ A new partnership with China.

 â¢ Stronger institutional partnerships in the region.

 â¢ And  re-building  our  position  as  a  good  international  citizen  through better global partnerships.

 A policy of engagement requires leadership, both at home and abroad.

 Not  the  boastful  swagger  of  the  ‘deputy  sheriff’,  but  a  true  leadership  that seeks  out  new  opportunities  and  new  partnerships  for  mutual  long-term benefits.

 2

 For  too  long  the  Howard  Government  has  behaved  as  though  we  have  no choice in foreign policy.

 The government believes we are exclusively tied to a reactive foreign policy agenda  —  one  that  defers  to  our  ‘great  and  powerful  friends’  —  but  does nothing to foster the real strength of our international position or offer a more independent view of the world.

 On  the  key  questions  of  strategic  policy,  such  as  the  current  war  against terrorism, Labor unapologetically stands with the US-led coalition because this is a struggle that affects us all.

 However,  support  for  the  war  on  terrorism  and  other  areas  of  co-operation with the US does not mean that this country’s foreign policy should be a pale shadow of America’s.

 Howard says we can still stand tall in the eyes of the world. But it’s hard to stand tall when you’re always on your knees.

 Mr Howard claims that our international reputation has never been higher.

 Who’s he kidding?

 You  only  have  to  look  at  international  media  reports  over  recent  years  and more recently speak to Australians who have travelled abroad to understand how low our reputation has sunk.

 John Howard is in denial.

 A New Proposal for China

 Thirty-one  years  ago  another  Labor  leader  saw  the  growing  importance  of China  in  the  region  and  decided  to  lead  an  ALP  delegation  to  Beijing  —  a delegation that included a young Stephen FitzGerald as an adviser.

 Contrary to the criticism from the Liberal government at the time — including McMahon’s famous line that Gough Whitlam had been played by the Chinese ‘like a fisherman plays a trout’ — his 1971 visit as Leader of the Opposition was instrumental in laying the groundwork for a stronger and more durable relationship between Australia and China.

 He  saw  the  future  and  did  not  resile  from  arguing  for  the  case  for  the diplomatic recognition of China.

 Two days later, when news broke that Henry Kissinger was in Beijing at the same time to negotiate US recognition of China — McMahon must have felt the sting of the fish hook in his own cheek.

 Gough  Whitlam  was  prepared  to  take  on  that  leadership  role.   It  was  the Labor way and a correct call.  If the conservatives had won office in 1972, we would have been followers not leaders.

 That  leadership  is  still  talked  about  by  the  Chinese  leadership  today.   And there remains a huge depth of goodwill towards Australia as a consequence.

 3

 It has been conveyed strongly to me in the various meetings I have had in recent  weeks  with  Foreign  Minister  Tang  and  the  head  of  Shangdong Province, Mr Wu Guanzheng.

 We need to build on that goodwill and take new initiatives to modernise the bilateral relationship.

 Just as  the  1971  visit set a new course  for  Australia’s  regional  engagement policy, I will be taking a new proposal to China next week on Labor’s plans for a closer partnership between Australia and China.

 Upon winning office — a Labor government will move to secure an agreement with China on closer economic, political and trade relations.

 Our objective will be the negotiation of an Australia/China treaty similar to the agreement on friendship and co-operation that we signed with Japan in 1976.

 The 1976 Nara Treaty was significant because it opened up a dialogue and a better cultural understanding between the two countries.

 As China opens up to the world and joins the international community as the newest  member  of  the  World  Trade  Organization,  the  time  is  right  for  a similar initiative with China.

 This  would  be  a  vehicle  for  better  government-to-government relations  that would in turn improve the prospects for Australian and Chinese businesses.

 The business communities in Australia and China should use this opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations with China to secure stronger ties.  I will be arguing strongly in China for projects such as  the  Liquid  Natural  Gas  contract  for  Guangdong  province  and  the opportunities  for  Australian  business  to  be  involved  in  the  2008  Beijing Olympics.

 There  is  no  doubt  that  China’s  size,  economic  growth  and  strategic  weight means that it will become even more important to its neighbours and to the region in the years ahead.

 And  it  remains  a  basic  axiom  of  international  politics  that  if  we  have  good relations with our neighbours and with the region, our security interests and our economic prospects are enhanced.

 For  these  reasons  it  is  important  we  set  down  some  clear  strategies  for building up the relationship now.

 My  proposal  to  the  Chinese  sets  out,  in  broad  terms,  the  benefits  that  can accrue  to  both  sides  as  a  result  of  China’s  rapid  growth  and  increasing integration into the regional and global economy.

 Although we see opportunities to extend and enhance our bilateral links with China, this won’t be at the exclusion of other countries in the region any more than it was in the early 1970s.

 4

 My proposal recognizes the importance of the Australia-China relationship. It renews and reinvigorates that relationship for its own importance and for the signal it gives.

 Under  a  Labor  government,  Australia  will  pursue  the  enhancement  of relations with China in the context of building an overall set of bilateral and multilateral relations in the region in order to build on the foundations of the WTO framework.

 Australia-China  relations  will  be  a  key  building  block  —  the  application  of  a bilateral mechanism to enhance regional and international structures.

 Building partnerships in the Region

 The direct benefits to Australia of regional engagement are well known.

 But  they  are  worth  repeating  because  they  tell  the  story  in  the  most unambiguous terms.

 Over one million Australian jobs now depend on exports — and sixty per cent of our exports go to Asian markets.

 In tabloid terms, ‘trade with Asia delivers Aussie jobs’.

 Moreover,  Asia  is  home  to  our  largest  trading  partner  (Japan),  our  most rapidly growing economic partner (China) and seven of our top ten markets.

 But under a new Labor government, our regional engagement policy will need to be recreated and not just resumed.

 Australia  must  be  willing  to  take  the  lead  in  seeking  new  partnerships  and new forms of engagement.

 We  need  to  recapture  some  of  the  independence,  activism  and  leadership that marked the foreign policy achievements of previous Labor governments.

 It will be about modernising the things that Labor has done well in the past.

 Under previous Labor governments, Australia’s middle power diplomacy — a diplomatic style that emphasises building coalitions of like-minded countries to achieve specific outcomes — had given us a greater degree of influence in the region and the world.

 Our work on the Cairns Group of agricultural traders, which negotiated better outcomes for agriculture in the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations, is exactly  the  kind  of  creative  diplomacy  that  middle-sized  countries  must engage in if they are to have their voices heard.

 Australia’s  other  major  initiatives,  such  as  the  Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation  (APEC)  forum,  the  Cambodian  Peace  Plan  and  the  Chemical Weapons Convention, were widely recognised as positive contributions to the economic and security architecture of the region.

 But the case for regional engagement needs to be constantly re-made.

 5

 There  are  several  steps  that  a  Labor  government  will  take  to  improve  and enhance the quality of our engagement with the region.

 First,  Australia’s  problems  in  its  relations  and  standing  in  Asia  under  the Howard  Government  have  stemmed  from  poorly  conceived  and  ineptly coordinated  policies.   So  a  clear  set  of  priorities  and  the  presentation  of  a more consistent and coherent image to the region is needed.

 A new Australian government should make a serious intellectual commitment to regional engagement as a cornerstone of our foreign policy.

 This  commitment  should  be  made  at  the  highest  levels  of  state-to-state relations. It should be a key priority for the Prime Minister.

 And  we  need  to  articulate  this  policy  through  closer  personal  contact  with regional leaders.

 Australia’s relations with Indonesia are a revealing example of the importance of close personal relationships.

 As  our  largest  neighbour  and  a  country  with  key  economic  and  strategic interests  for  Australia,  the  Australia-Indonesia  relationship  cannot  be successfully  maintained  unless  there  is  a  high  level  of  understanding  and sophistication that goes with close and continuing engagement.

 Likewise, Singapore is a country of great importance to Australia in terms of regional co-operation.

 Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and I have already held discussions on where our two countries should be positioned to meet the challenges that face the region in the next ten to twenty years.

 I will be visiting Jakarta, Singapore and other regional capitals within the next twelve  to  eighteen  months  to  hold  further  discussions  on  these  important matters.

 Second, Australia must work to broaden the terms of engagement with Asia.

 There are a number of issues, sometimes referred to as ‘third agenda issues’, which are highly important to regional countries and on which Australia has good skills, experience and ideas to offer.

 Australian  expertise  in  dealing  with  problems  such  as  food  security,  water scarcity and alternative energy sources is much needed in the region.

 If the events of September 11 demonstrate one thing, it is that threats to the security of individuals are now more diverse and less predictable.

 In  addition  to  the  traditional  security  agenda  of  nation-states,  Asian  leaders are increasingly defining security by reference to a broader range of concerns that  include  terrorism  alongside  trans-national  crime,  disease  and  ethnic  or religious violence.

 6

 Countries  such  as  South  Korea  and  Japan  have  been  at  the  forefront  of debates about how — in this new threat environment — states must employ a comprehensive  approach  to  security  policy  that  includes  environmental, humanitarian and social responses.

 Australia should be more closely engaged in these debates in order to shape and direct a regional response to this new ‘human security’ agenda.

 Broadening the terms of regional engagement should also include expanding the range of contacts beyond the senior ministers usually involved.

 If some interested Members of Parliament — both State and Federal — were willing  to  take  on  the  task  of  developing  contacts  with  one  Asian  country, such as Peter Cook’s interest in China or the long-standing interest that Tim Fischer  had  in  Thailand  —  then  Australia’s  networks  could  gradually  be deepened in ways that are likely to bring benefits to both sides.

 Such linkages are often well established in the academic field - such as the various Alumni associations in countries like Thailand and Malaysia.  I will do more  to  expand  these  types  of  networks  to  include  politicians,  business leaders and community groups.

 Third,  Australian  diplomacy  will  need  to  be  flexible  and  sufficiently independent enough to meet the challenges of future regional integration.

 Australia  must  be  prepared  to  help  define,  and  if  necessary,  lead  the development of the new economic and security architecture as it emerges in the region.

 Under a more active leadership in the past, Australia played this role by giving regional  institutions  greater  strength  through  initiatives  such  as  the  Bogor Declaration of APEC leaders.

 Under my leadership, Australia would be doing much more to rejuvenate the APEC  forum  and  to  promote  the  goal  of  open  regionalism.  This  should  be done in tandem with seeking to establish the new round of WTO negotiations.

 In the wake of the Asian financial crisis, new patterns of regional co-operation have emerged.

 At least five new groupings or dialogues have been proposed since 1996.

 These  include  the  Asia-Europe  Meeting  (ASEM),  the  ASEAN  plus  Three dialogue,  President  Wahid’s  idea  for  a  ‘West  Pacific’  forum,  a  proposed meeting of Asia-Pacific Defence ministers and, most recently, Prime Minister Koizumi’s proposal for closer East Asian economic co-operation.

 Although the process of regional institutional building is still in a state of flux, Australia needs the flexibility to pursue as many avenues as possible.

 Some of these arrangements and proposals have included Australia from the start.

 7

 Other proposals represent an interest in East Asian-focused co-operation that Australia might not easily or readily gain formal membership.

 One of the strengths that Australia can bring to the table in terms of defining the  new  institutional  architecture  is  our  close  and  enduring  security relationship with the United States.

 But Australia must ensure that we make an independent assessment of where our  national  interests  lie  and  should  not  appear  to  reflexively  support  US policy stances on all matters of regional importance.

 If  Australia is  pursuing  a serious  engagement policy  with  Asia,  it  is  likely  to have some policy views that differ from those prevailing in Washington.

 It  is  crucial  for  Australia  to  have  an  independently  derived  and  carefully argued Asia policy.  I believe it will enhance our standing in Asia and in the U.S.

 Washington  will  clearly  assign  a  higher  value  to  an  informed  rather  than  a compliant ally.

 Engagement must also be about Asia and the Pacific.

 In  the  mid-1990s  we  undertook  a  fundamental  shift  in  foreign  policy orientation towards the Pacific Island countries.

 At  that  time,  we  recognised  that  the  combination  of  population  growth, environmental  degradation  and  the  fragility  of  economic  and  political institutions meant that change was needed in how Australia approached the region  and,  in  particular,  how  we  delivered  sustainable  outcomes  on  both trade and aid.

 The  subsequent  conflicts  in  the  Solomon  Islands  and  Fiji  have  only underscored the need for this type of comprehensive, multi-layered approach.

 Instead,  we  get  from  this  government  short-term  political  fixes  such  as  the ‘Pacific  Solution’  to  deal  with  asylum  seekers  -  the  legality  of  which,  for countries like Papua New Guinea, has yet to be determined.

 We  should  not  underestimate  the  damage  that  this  policy  has  done  to  our long-term  interests  in  promoting  good  governance  and  sustainable development in the South Pacific region.

 Building better Global Partnerships

 Australia  has  had  a  proud  history  of  building  global  partnerships  to  tackle global problems.

 But under the Howard Government, Australia has gone from being a leader in brokering  global  solutions  on  issues  as  diverse  as  human  rights,  the environment and arms control to being missing in action.

 We can’t influence global agendas if we haven’t got a seat at the table. After failing  six  years  ago,  the  Howard  Government  still  hasn’t  managed  to  get

 8

 Australia back on to the UN Security Council, it has downgraded our contacts with the International Labour Organization and has only now just managed to get us a seat at the Commission on Human Rights.

 The problem is that Australia is not seen as an indispensable country to any of  these  institutions  because  we  are  seen  as  having  limited  interest  in multilateral frameworks.

 But for some of the most important global issues confronting Australia — such as people smuggling and asylum seekers — building international frameworks is the only way to go.

 I  have  called  for  this  approach  several  times,  but  despite  the  Government saying it is interested in a lasting solution, they didn’t get more countries to sign the 1967 Refugees Protocol at the Bali Conference and they didn’t even have this issue on the CHOGM agenda.

 Australia can be tough on border protection and compassionate at the same time.

 Australians  are  rightly  offended  by  the  notion  of  ‘queue  jumping’,  by  the suggestion that people aren’t getting an equal and fair go.  But it is obvious to all Australians who watch the nightly news that in countries embroiled in conflicts,  orderly  refugee  queues  do  not  really  exist.   We  must  help  create them  as  well  as  tackle  the  problem  of  people  smuggling  and  refugee movements at their source.

 To do this  we  must honour  our  international  treaty  obligations  and  work  to get others to support multilateral solutions.

 We need leadership to get us back to the table.

 Being a good international citizen is the right way to go — it’s the Labor way. It is in our national interest and it builds respect.

 The environment is a good example of the need to build global partnerships to  tackle  global  problems.   And  it  is  not  only  the  environment  that  suffers when we fail to find global solutions.

 Australian  companies  are  already  involved  in  exporting  to  a  growing international  market  for  environmental  goods  and  services.  Our  exports  are currently worth about $1 billion a year and expected to grow by 30 per cent over the next decade.

 Australian  industry  has  a  competitive  advantage  when  it  comes  to environmental  markets.  Our  technical  expertise,  our  experience  with  local environmental challenges, the structure of our economy and our proximity to Asia  provides  us  with  opportunities  that  have  not  been  recognized  by  the Howard Government.

 Organizations such as Australian Business Ltd are already working with local companies in India, Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia and China on a range of new technologies  —  including  waste-water  treatment,  sustainable  energy,  soil

 9

 mapping and automotive-emission controls — to assist with growing concerns in the region about environmental degradation.

 But our access to new environmental markets will be limited if we continue to play the spoiler role in environmental negotiations.

 The  Howard  Government’s  reluctance  to  ratify  the  Kyoto  Protocol  is  putting Australian companies at a disadvantage.

 Failure to ratify the Protocol means that Australia will be unable to participate in global emissions trading and unable to gain credit for emission reductions achieved  in  partnership  with  developing  countries  or  other  industrialized nations.

 This  could  cost  Australia  millions  of  dollars  in  lost  overseas  investment opportunities and local jobs as companies move their operations offshore.

 Australia  cannot  afford  to  simply  opt-out  of  these  important  international agreements.

 A  Labor  government  will  immediately  ratify  the  Kyoto  Protocol  to  tackle climate  change,  to  protect  our  natural  assets,  to  support  growing  industries such as tourism and environmental exports and to ensure a sustainable future for our traditional value-added industries like coal and gas.

 Coal  and  gas  are  important  sources  of  power  for  electricity  generation,  and will  remain  vital  into  the  future.   It  is  in  finding  cleaner  and  more  efficient ways of using these along with other fuel sources, that Australia can maintain its competitive advantage and secure Australian jobs while at the same time reducing greenhouse emissions.

 Labor  takes  our  international  responsibilities  very  seriously.  It is  in  our  self-interest  that  we  do  so  because  we  ourselves  depend  on  the  international system.

 Finding an effective solution to the current cycle of violence in the Middle East must begin with the UN Security Council resolutions and the various proposals for a peace settlement.

 At present there is no trust.  There is nothing to negotiate.  It is a stalemate.

 The framework for peace in the Middle East through international cooperation does exist, but it exists through the international community and cooperation between the two parties.

 The same principle needs to be applied to finding a solution to the problem posed by Iraq - and its refusal to abide by the standards of the international community.

 Earlier today I released a statement that sets out Labor’s policy approach to the  question  of  possible  military  action  against  Iraq  as  part  of  the  war  on terrorism.

 10

 Our  Shadow  Cabinet  considered  this  last  week  and  has  determined  our approach.

 Fundamental  to  Labor’s  approach  is  the  recognition  that  the  United  Nations has a crucial role to play in determining what next steps should be taken on Iraq.

 It is our view that the case has not yet been made as would warrant a direct and immediate attack on Iraq.

 In the absence of any credible information that links Saddam Hussein to the September 11 terrorist bombings or indicates a rapid increase in his ability to use  nuclear,  chemical  or  biological  weapons,  the  international  community must continue to work through the UN mechanisms that are in place to deal with Iraq.

 Labor  believes  that  before  any  decision  is  made  concerning  Australian involvement in, or support for, military action against Iraq three steps need to be taken.

 First, the Government must provide the Opposition with a full briefing on the evidence from all relevant domestic agencies.

 Second,  discussions  must  be  held  between  John  Howard  and  myself  on  an appropriate course of action.

 And third, Parliament should be recalled as a matter of urgency to debate and determine the matter.

 The Australian people expect strong bipartisan support before major military commitments are made.

 Conclusion

 It has become popular in narratives of Australia’s post-World War II history to view  foreign  policy  as  one  area  of  broad  agreement  between  the  major political parties.

 But the Howard Government’s decision to shift foreign policy away from the processes of regional engagement and to focus exclusively on bilateralism has undermined 50 years of bipartisanship in this country.

 Australia’s middle power diplomacy under Labor, which emphasised building a broad  consensus  of  ideas  and  interests,  had  given  us  a  place  at  the negotiating table, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.

 However,  the  retreat  from  that  leadership  role  has  damaged  our  political stocks and has relegated Australia to a secondary player on the international stage.

 With  bilateralism  as  its  only  policy  tool,  the  Howard  government  has  been excluded from the emerging dynamism of regional integration.

 11

 Being an active, independent country engaged in the region and the world is about making choices.

 Governments  can  choose  to  employ  their  diplomatic  resources  in  certain ways. At the end of the day, Australia will always need to be engaged.

 But whether or not that engagement is pursued in a positive and constructive way depends ultimately on what governments in Canberra seek to do with it.

 Building a strong partnership with China, Asia and the rest of the world is the way forward.
