  Asylum seekers stranded: not good enough 

 

 

  It is reported that Australian custom official’s left 50 asylum seekers ship-wrecked for four days  after their boat hit a reef in the Torres Strait.   

  Dr Sharman Stone, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship said it is of great concern  that Border Security Officials were so bamboozled with the Labor Governments latest changes to  the Boarder Security Policy that Customs stood back and observed the stranded passengers for  four days before deciding that it was probably their job and not the Defence Force’s.    

 “Clearly the people smugglers have moved from chartering smaller to larger craft, with this boat  load of 50 the second in three weeks carrying a similar number.”   

 “The 10 smuggler runs since August have been predominantly smaller craft- with 12 to 15 on  board. “   

 Dr Stone said it was also a great concern that this boat was stranded for a number of days and  the passengers finally landed on Horn Island in an area of extreme quarantine risk.    

 “The Torres Strait Islands are our first frontier in trying to guard against pest diseases; it seems  extraordinary that this boat threaded its way into the Torres Strait without detection for so  long.”   

 “Clearly the Rudd Government’s brand new re-badging exercise -renaming the Australian  Customs Service to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service is nothing more then a  farce, when we have an episode like this with Australian officials confused, leaving lives at risk  and boarder security in jeopardy.” 

 

 “I call on Minister Debus and Minister Evans as well as Defence officials to urgently review what  went wrong if this episode is as reported,” Dr Stone said.
