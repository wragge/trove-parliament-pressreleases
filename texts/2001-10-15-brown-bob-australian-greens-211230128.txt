 Brown Proposes Senate Leaders Debate to Stott-Despoja, Hanson and Boswell

 Greens Senator Bob Brown has written to Senators Stott-Despoja, Hanson and Boswell proposing an alternative Senate leader debate.

 “It is important that voters are given the opportunity to focus on the policies of all Senate parties before the November 10 poll,” Senator Brown said.

 “People have two votes and many people will consider voting differently with their Senate vote.

 “Whether Kim Beazley or John Howard wins they will have to get their legislation passed by the Senate as well as the House of Representatives

 “A Senate leaders debate would also cover ground left off the agenda by Mr Beazley and Mr Howard on issues like the destruction of natives forests, global warming, public transport and returning spending on public education to average OECD levels.

 “It would also allow an alternative view to be put on issues on which Howard and Beazley are indistinguishable like the treatment of asylum seekers and Australia’s response to terrorism.

 “I look forward to the other minor party senators supporting my debate proposal. The Greens wrote to the ABC over a week ago suggesting such a debate,” Senator Brown said.
