 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 05/278 WEDNESDAY 25 MAY 2005   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS SPOKESPERSON ON IMMIGRATION  PM'S CONSCIENCE VOTE BAN UNCONSCIONABLE The Australian Democrats have condemned the Prime Minister's refusal to allow Liberal members a conscience vote on the issue of detention of asylum seekers.  "I can't think of an issue that is more an issue of conscience than people being locked up without charge or trial," Democrat Immigration Spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett said. Senator Bartlett welcomed the moves by Liberal backbenchers to introduce a Private Members Bill for selective rather than mandatory detention, saying such moves combined with community pressure, could significantly change Government policy. "It is equally welcome that Liberal MP, Petro Georgiou, is also proposing scrapping Temporary Protection Visas an equally nasty policy introduced in 1999," Senator Bartlett said. "While the Democrats applaud the Liberals who are opposing Government policy on detention, it should be realised that it will take continuing public as well as political pressure to ensure the laws get changed. "A similar example was the Private Senators Bill on mandatory sentencing which the Democrats and others parties brought forward a few years ago. This Bill didn't pass the Parliament, but its presence helped increase pressure for change via other means. "This is a good demonstration of the impact of continuing public pressure from a wide range of people from across the community. Hassling of politicians doesn't always have an impact, but on this issue it certainly is, and if people are concerned about this issue, they should make their concerns heard." Senator Bartlett also condemned the comments from Liberal Minister Senator Coonan for MPs to air their concerns about Government immigration policy only in the party room. "Senator Coonan put her name to a Senate committee report recommending changes to our asylum seekers system five years ago, so it is disappointing she no longer believes in the right to speak out. "The Immigration Department tries to stop detainees speaking to the media. Now the Liberal Party wants to stop their Members of Parliament expressing their opinions to the public."
