 SOUTH AUSTRALIAN FLOUR TO ASSIST HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN AFGHANISTAN

 'South Australians can be proud that South Australian wheat is going to help people suffering from the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan', Chris Gallus, MP, Member for Hindmarsh and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs said today.

 Mrs Gallus' comments came while visiting the South Australian mill where the flour, to be packaged in bags marked 'Gift of Australia', is being processed. It will be sent to assist the World Food Programme's relief activities in South West Asia.

 The Australian Government's overseas aid program has committed 7,200 tonnes of Australian wheat to assist humanitarian relief activities in Afghanistan and neighbouring regions.

 A large component of this wheat, valued at approximately $5 million, is from the wheat growing areas north of Adelaide, with all of it milled into flour at Goodman Fielders Mill in Mile End.

 'South Australians are always ready to help those in need and the Australian Government's decision to provide emergency food aid to the people in Afghanistan is a good example of this.'

 Our overseas aid program is a major buyer of Australian goods - which means more jobs for Australians, and in this case South Australians. Over recent years, the Government's overseas aid program has bought about 50,000 tonnes of wheat annually from South Australian farmers. And South Australian millers produce about 8,000 tonnes of flour each year.

 'All of this goes to help those most vulnerable, as well as benefiting South

 Australians - a win-win situation,' Mrs Gallus said.

 The Australian Government has committed a total of $23.3 million towards the delivery of humanitarian assistance to displaced and refugee populations in South West Asia. This includes support for Australian non-government organizations and international aid agencies such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration to provide emergency assistance. Australia will continue to cooperate with the international community in the provision of humanitarian relief and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan.
