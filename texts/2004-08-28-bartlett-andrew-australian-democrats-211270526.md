 Senator Andrew Bartlett   

 Dated: 28 August 2004    

 PM still avoids giving public the whole truth on refugees and  Iraq war  If the Prime Minister genuinely wants to be open about the truth behind the false children overboard  claims, he would allow his staff to be questioned by a Senate Committee. Democrats' Leader, Senator  Andrew Bartlett, said "With our public service now so politicised, few public servants will volunteer  evidence the Prime Minister doesn't want to hear.   

 "Of even bigger concern than the growing evidence that the PM was told the truth but continued to  mislead the media and the public on the election eve, is that he has never shown regret.   

 "Mr Howard not only appears to be a serial deceiver, but doesnt correct the record or change policies  when he gets the facts. Children overboard, weapons overboard, the POW abuse, and new claims about  Australian operations in Iraq, add up to a lot of lies told to the public and the parliament.   

 "The Democrats are the only non-Government party to support Australian troops assisting to rebuild  Iraq at least until Iraqi elections. If the Government has lied about what Australian troops are doing,  that has serious consequences for the Democrats support of an Australian military presence in Iraq, for  the future of the troops, and for Australian democracy.   

 "The PM has never taken one step back from the decisions that flowed from false claims - whether  about children overboard or the Iraq war and its aftermath. The immigration policy adopted and the  defence decisions that flowed from those lies, are flawed but are still defended, regardless of the  emerging facts.   

 "Major General Powell, Commander Noonan and political staff should be interviewed by a Senate  committee, so they, along with Mr Scrafton, can be publicly asked all the questions that need to be  asked, not just the ones the Prime Minister chooses.   

 "Mr Howard complains about people still exploring so-called 'old news' when it is Mr Howard himself  who has done so much to prevent proper scrutiny. Mr Howard and his Ministers went to great lengths  to stop key staff appearing before the previous Senate Committee. He cannot expect the public to  believe that his hand-picked transcripts of private questioning tell the full story.   

 "A Senate Inquiry is now crucial - not so Senators can   judge, but so the truth can be revealed and the public can have the full facts to make the judgment for  themselves, Senator Bartlett concluded.
