 50 REASONS TO CELEBRATE THE UN

 The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, today launched a year of  celebrations and special projects in Australia to mark the 50th anniversary of the  founding of the United Nations.

 "The entry into force of the UN Charter on 24 October 1945, was a momentous event  for the world," he said. "It brought with it the promise of a new way of managing  relations between governments, a new international order in the place of the failures  and broken dreams of the 1920s and '30s which had produced war and destruction on 

 a catastrophic scale. To people everywhere, emerging from the cynicism and despair  of a shattered world, it gave cause for new hope for a better future."

 Senator Evans said that the 50th Anniversary of the founding of the UN was a time of  renewal for the organisation. "It must be more than a simple birthday celebration,  important though that is. The UN must seize the energy this moment offers to start on 

 a process of much needed reform," he said.

 In response to a request from the UN, a National Committee consisting of Australians  from all walks of life was established last December to encourage and co-sponsor  commemorative activities to be held in Australia next year. The Committee  recommended that activities focus on two anniversary issues:

 . The UN: responding to the challenges of the 21st Century, and  . How does the UN affect Australia and Australians?

 Much of the program of anniversary activities recommended by the National  Committee, as elsewhere in the world, focuses on youth and education. "This places  a most appropriate emphasis on the hopes that we all have for the future of the United  Nations," Senator Evans said. The corporate sector was also identified by the 

 National Committee as a particular target group for the anniversary because of the  ways that the UN and its specialised agencies influence the international commercial  environment.

 Highlights of the Australian programs include:

 . the visit to Australia of the Secretary-General of the UN, Dr Boutros Boutros-  Ghali, and the Director-General of UNESCO, Dr Frederico Mayor, in April for  the international conference on Global Cultural Diversity, which will be one of  the major events on the UN's international calendar and a part of the 

 International Year of Tolerance;

 a range of other conferences on the United Nations and international relations  themes being organised under the banner of the UN Association of Australia  and by universities;

 two major youth conferences next July -  a national Youth Convention for  secondary students in Canberra and a Model UN General Assembly for tertiary  students in Sydney;

 an active media campaign and a speaking program organised by the UN  Association of Australia. A panel of high-profile Australians with differing  perspectives of the UN has been established for contact with the media. (A list 

 of the members of the Media Panel is attached.);

 a curriculum package for schools on the role of the UN;

 an essay and poster competition on the UN for children throughout Australia;

 a commemorative stamp issue by Australia Post and a 20-cent coin  commemorating the anniversary by the Australian Mint;

 a film produced by Film Australia on Dr Evatt and his role in the creation of the  UN;

 the launch in Sydney on 10-11 August 1995 of the Global Youth Project (an  official UN project) -  a full-length feature film depicting youth culture  worldwide, with an accent on music;

 special anniversary concerts by state symphony orchestras.
