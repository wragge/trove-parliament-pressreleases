 AUSTRALIA RELEASES PROTOCOL FOR SHIPS ASSISTING PEOPLE IN DISTRESS AT SEA

 The Australian Government has released a protocol to clarify the responsibilities of Australian and international ships' masters rescuing people at sea.

 The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson, released the protocol today.

 "The protocol provides guidance to ships' masters on the processes that are to be followed in relation to landing people who have been rescued at sea," Mr Anderson said.

 "The protocol is part of the Government's response to the Tampa incident in August 2001. We developed it following a request for clarification from the shipping industry.

 "It is consistent with Australia's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the International Convention on Search and Rescue, and the International Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea.

 "While traditions and conventions exist on the duties of various parties to assist people in distress at sea, there has been no guidance or internationally accepted procedures for determining where survivors are to be landed.

 "The protocol sets out important principles that must be recognised to ensure a smooth post-rescue effort while minimising the disruption to the intended voyage of the rescuing vessels.

 "The protocol does not distinguish between people who are seeking asylum and other persons who are in distress at sea. It is based on seven key principles, which are as follows:

 Search and rescue coordination remains the responsibility of the region in which the rescue takes place; 1.   Any decision to disembark rescued people at a particular port should not take place without the consent of the State in which the port is located; 2.  

 The involvement of any ship in a rescue is likely to have commercial consequences which need to be taken into account when determining arrangements for disembarking those rescued; 3.  

 Australia has an obligation to give expeditious consideration to suitable options for disembarkation of rescued people and to not unreasonably withhold consent for use of its port; 4.  

 Disembarking arrangements need to be consistent with any regional or international refugee, security or border protection arrangements; 5.  

 There should be no incentive for people to be deliberately put at risk in pursuit of entry to Australia; and 6.   Australia has a sovereign right to determine who comes into Australia. 7.  

 "The protocol is not intended to provide a detailed step-by step process to cover every possible scenario where a

 commercial ship rescues persons in distress at sea.

 "Instead, it aims to provide general guidance to ships' masters on the procedures to be followed by all parties in determining the most appropriate way of landing those rescued," Mr Anderson said.

 The protocol will be regularly reviewed by the Government and will be revised as required, taking into account both national and international developments. The protocol will formally come into effect from 20 June 2002. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority will notify shipping of the release of the protocol accordingly.

 The protocol can be accessed at the Department's website, at: www.dotars.gov.au/latest.htm
