 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister  for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan 

 Illegal boat arrivals on track to top 20,000 in 2012/13 

 Saturday 27th April 2013 

 The illegal arrival of the 40th boat this month with 86 people on board continues to put the 

 Government on track to receive 20,000 in 2012/13 according to Shadow Minister for 

 Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and 

 Border Protection, Michael Keenan.    

 "So far this financial year almost 19,000 people have arrived illegally by boat, including the most  recent arrival, the 40th boat this month carrying 86 people," Mr Morrison said.    

 "The Government is already having their biggest year of failure on record. With people turning  up this month at the rate of more than 100 per day, it is certain that illegal arrivals by boat will  top 20,000 arrivals this year.   

 "Not only does this smash the Government's increased quota for taking refugees, but it means  that under Labor's policies, all of those who have come by boat and found to have claims will  take the place of those waiting offshore for their place under our programme all around the  world.   

 "With the queue of those arriving on shore by boat growing at record levels, this means the  queue for those waiting off shore will only get worse. This is bad news for those trying to come  to Australia the right way and demonstrates again how Labor's policies are just giving people  more and more incentives to come on a boat.   

 "Arrivals of more than 20,000 this year also make a mockery of the Government's budget, which  assumed just 12,000 arrivals this year. The Government's current budget estimates for illegal  boat arrivals are pure fiscal fantasy," Mr Morrison said.       

 Mr Keenan said: “Over 40 boats have now been intercepted this month as April looks set to have  over 3000 people arrive illegally by boat - the highest number to ever arrive by boat in  Australia in one month.      

 “The Labor Party’s soft touch on border protection has allowed criminal people smuggling  syndicates to thrive.      

 “As a country we don’t have to accept that this is how it has to be - we can take back control of  our borders through tough but necessary border protection policies that have worked to stop  people smuggling before.      

 “The Coalition has the resolve to squash the people smuggling trade that is currently dictating  who comes to our country,” Mr Keenan said.
