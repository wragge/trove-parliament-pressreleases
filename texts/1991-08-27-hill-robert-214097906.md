 MEDIA RELEASE SENATOR ROBERT HILL LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE  SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

 WORLD MOST TAKE ACTION TO HELP CROATIAN REFUGEES s HTT.T.

 The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Hill, today said  the international community should take action to assist the  thousands of Croatians made refugees by the Yugoslav army-backed  invasion of Croatia by Serbia.

 Senator Hill made his comment after meeting Croatian community  leaders in Melbourne today.

 "The invasion of Croatia by federal army-backed Serbian forces  has resulted in an appalling level of violence and loss of human  life," Senator Hill said.

 "But one major consequence of the conflict - the growing number  of Croatian refugees who have left their homes after attacks or  in fear of violence - has not attracted much attention.

 "Some estimates put the number of Croatian refugees as high as  125,000, and international relief agencies say they are desperate  for help.

 "The Federal Opposition has called on the Australian Government  to press for action by the international community to achieve the  withdrawal of the Yugoslav federal army from Croatia.

 "While the international community pursues this path through such  bodies as the United Nations Security Council, it should also  make a co-ordinated effort to help Croatian refugees with  urgently needed relief.

 "The International Red Cross should be permitted to help the  refugees from its headquarters in Geneva rather than through its  Yugoslav office in Belgrade.

 "The plight of Croatians is disturbing and the prospects for  peace are rapidly diminishing.

 "My talks in Melbourne today with representatives of Australia's  Croatian community highlighted the deep concern within Australia  at the escalating violence and loss of life.

 "The 5000 or so petitions I received today will be used in the  Federal Parliament to make the Australian Government fully aware  of the extent of that concern and of the aspirations of Croatia."
