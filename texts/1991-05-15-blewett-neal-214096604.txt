 Additional $5 million famine assistance for Africa

 Australia will provide $5 million additional emergency-  assistance to help victims of the escalating famine in the Horn  of Africa, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Neal Blewett, announced today.

 Dr Blewett said the extra assistance would be split between  Sudan and Ethiopia and would be channelled through Australian  non-government organisations (NGOs) and the World Food Program  (WFP).

 "This will bring Australia's total assistance to the Horn of  Africa during this financial year to $16 million.

 "In recognition of the enormity of the famine tragedy, the  Government has supplemented AIDAB's funds for emergencies and  refugees because the budget allocation for the entire financial  year was already virtually exhausted," he said.

 Dr Blewett said that this had been a difficult year for all  organisations providing overseas aid due to an unprecedented  number of disasters and emergencies.

 Australia had already allocated some $60 million for  emergencies and refugees in this financial year, including the  Gulf crisis ($7.5m), the Bangladesh cyclone ($2.25m),  Mozambique ($7.3m), Cambodia ($4m) and the Iranian earthquake 

 ($lm).

 The additional emergency assistance to the Horn of Africa would  comprise:

 For Sudan -* 3 700 tonnes of Australian wheat to be distributed through  the WFP;

 For Ethiopia:

 * $1.5m to the Food Aid Working Group, a consortium of  Australian NGOs, to purchase and transport Australian wheat  and wheat flour to Eritrea and Tigray; * $500 000 to the WFP to cover fuel costs for food 

 distribution in the Ogaden; and * $500 000 to Austcare for emergency medical supplies for  displaced people.

 Australian emergency assistance for Sudan and Ethiopia forms  part of the Australian development assistance program  administered by the Australian International Development 

 Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).
