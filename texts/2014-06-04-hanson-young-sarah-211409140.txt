 Lowy Poll shows Australians want refugees in Australia   

 The results of the Lowy Poll released today show that the majority of Australians (57%)  reject Tony Abbott’s policy of dumping refugees in third world countries and instead want  to see them resettled here, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “These results are a massive blow to Tony Abbott’s plans for a refugee dump in  Cambodia,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Despite the Abbott Government’s attempts to generate fear in the community with its  war on refugees, more than half of all Australians want to see them settled here.   

 “While there’s been a clear lack of moral leadership from the Labor and Liberal Parties,  many Australians know that the way we’re treating vulnerable refugee children is simply  wrong.   

 “Almost half, 47 per cent, of Australians want to see all refugees processed here rather  than in the gulags on Manus Island and Nauru.    

 “After the tragic events on Manus Island that led to the death of Reza Barati and the  shocking mental health crisis amongst children on Nauru, Australians are saying loud  and clear that the cruelty towards refugees has gone too far.   

 “There is a better way and Australia should be leading the region when it comes to  protecting refugees.”
