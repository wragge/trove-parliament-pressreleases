 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales 

 

 

 West Papuans in Torres Strait still imprisoned  after 14 days: face return or imprisonment on  Nauru 

 

 Senator Nettle, 22nd May 2006  Greens Immigration Spokesperson, Senator Kerry Nettle, today established through  questions in the Senate estimates process that three West Papuan men are still being  detained in the Torres Strait by the Department of Immigration and face imprisonment  on Nauru if they cannot be returned to Papua New Guinea.    

 Departmental officials confirmed that three men are being held in a hotel in the Torres  Strait Islands guarded by GSL officers; they have made a claim for asylum in  Australia but have not and may not have that claim assessed.    

 The department has not yet been able to arrange their return to Papua New Guinea  under the terms of the 2003 MOU. Departmental head Andrew Metcalfe confirmed  that if continuing attempts to have them returned to PNG fail they will be sent to  Nauru.    

 "These men are experiencing the cruel policy of the Howard government that refuses  to deal with asylum claims instead ejecting potential refugees back to Papua New  Guinea or exile on Nauru," Senator Nettle said.    

 "These men should be brought to mainland Australia and have their claims assessed.  Anything less is cruelly weaselling out of Australia's international obligations toward  refugees.    

 "The fact is that some West Papuans still face danger in Papua New Guinea and could  be under threat if returned.    

 "The government is willing to ruin these three lives in order to appease Jakarta."
