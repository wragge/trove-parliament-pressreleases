 Senator Amanda Vanstone  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 

 What's Happening in Nauru 

 VPS 016/2003

 I welcome the statement by the Republic of Nauru setting the record straight on conditions in the Offshore Processing Centre  (OPC), managed by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and hosted by Nauru.

 The statement by the Hon Russell Kun MP makes clear that the conditions on Nauru are not a 'hell-hole' as Senator Bob  Brown and others have claimed. 

 Asylum seekers are free to attend Nauruan public hospital facilities.

 Their children attend local schools with Nauruan children. The residents of the facility are free to move around the island for  shopping, picnics, swimming and participation in sporting events.

 In particular, Senator Brown should retract his claim that people live behind razor wire and acknowledge the facts.

 Senator Brown and other critics should particularly take note of Mr Kun's statement that ' Asylum seekers accommodated on  our island have been provided with a level of care and conditions that are equal to, if not better than, that of the Nauruan  people themselves.'

 I hope the protesters are not being misled by people in Australia into believing that a hunger strike holds any prospect of  forcing the Australian government to grant visas to people who have been found not to be refugees.

 The Hon John Hodges and Gholam Aboss have arrived in Nauru today to undertake a direct dialogue with those protesting in  the OPC and consult further with the IOM.
