 Focus on Border Control, Security and Skilled Migration

 VPS 054/2005

 Key features of Budget 2005-06

 The Australian Government's continued commitment to strengthening Australia's border security is key focus for the 2005-06 Budget, the Minister  for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today. 

 The Minister said that the government's dedication to protecting Australia's borders has already resulted in a dramatic decrease in unauthorised  arrivals, allowing Australia to take more people from overseas in need of resettlement. 

 ' The government is always looking to build on its successes and a number of measures have bee developed to ensure this, with an additional  $112.3 million being provided for new border control initiatives over the next four years,' Senator Vanstone said. 

 'Almost $44 million over four years will be spent on making improvements to the Movement Alert List to ensure it remains a state-of-the-art, front-line tool for national security and to combat fraud. 

 ' The use of biometric technology will also be expanded at the cost of almost $43 million over four years, delivering enhanced security and identity  verification at the border,' Senator Vanstone said. 

 Other border security initiatives include: 

 â     More than $12 million over four years for additional intelligence officers at Australian airports and seaports, to monitor people smuggling 

 threats; additional compliance officers and Airline Liaison Officers - to be placed overseas - playing a key role in preventing people from  fraudulently entering the country. â     Almost $12 million over four years to help combat identity fraud through additional document examiners and document detection 

 equipment in Australia and overseas.

 The Minister said that skilled migration is another major priority of the government, with the 2005-06 Migration Programme including a number of  initiatives to address the skills shortage in Australia and to assist regional areas. The 20 000 additional places will help meet Australia's short and  long-term labour force needs. 

 'The government will also build on changes in both programme size and composition of the Humanitarian Programme in 2005-06 and the enhanced  settlement services agreed to in the Budget,' Senator Vanstone said. 

 'The programme will be maintained at 13 000 places. This includes maintaining the 50 per cent increase in refugee places announced last year,  from 4000 to 6000 places, plus 7000 special humanitarian places,” she said. 

 Further detail on the announcement can be found in the Budget 2005-06 Budget media kit on the department's website at www.immi.gov.au/budget
