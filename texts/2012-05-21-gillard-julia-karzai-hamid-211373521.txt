 Comprehensive Long-term Partnership  Between 

 Australia and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan   

 1. The Government of Australia and the Government of the Islamic Republic of  Afghanistan, hereinafter known as Australia and Afghanistan respectively and  collectively as “Governments”, share a commitment to peace, democracy and  development, and reaffirm their common respect for sovereignty, human rights  and the rule of law. 

 2. The Governments recognise their shared interests in a secure, stable and  democratic Afghanistan, able to defend itself against international terrorism, a  partner in peace with its surrounding region, and a valued contributor to the  broader community of nations. 

 3. The Governments reaffirm their commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes  between states and to the principle of territorial integrity. 

 4. The Governments recall the various undertakings made at the London, Kabul,  Lisbon and Bonn conferences, as well as existing bilateral undertakings, and,  building on their existing strong friendship and the historical ties between the two  countries, commit to a long-term partnership for cooperation, based on shared  strategic interests, in the following areas. 

 Political   

 5. The Governments reaffirm their respect for the principles of national sovereignty,  independence and non-interference in internal affairs, in accordance with  international law.  They note Afghanistan’s position in the heart of Asia and their  shared support for regional stability and peaceful regional relations. 

 6. The Governments will cooperate to support shared interests in international,  regional and multilateral fora and respect for obligations under applicable  international treaties and conventions, including through regular political  consultations on bilateral, regional and international issues. 

 7. Australia welcomes the continued efforts of the Afghan people to build a stable,  democratic society, based on the rule of law, where human rights, including the  equality of all men and women, are guaranteed under the Afghan Constitution.  In  particular, the governments reaffirm their commitment to promoting and  protecting the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan.  In support of these  efforts, Australia will work with the Government of Afghanistan to build the   capacity of government and national institutions to promote and protect human  rights. 

 8. The Governments recognise the importance of a political solution to achieving  peace and security in Afghanistan and the region.  The Governments recognise  that the reconciliation process must be Afghan led and Afghan-owned and be  based on the renunciation of violence, severing ties to international terrorism and  respect for the Afghan Constitution.  The Governments reaffirm the importance of  regional support for reconciliation. The Government of Australia will continue to  provide support to Afghan institutions and processes, including the Afghan Peace  and Reintegration Programme, in pursuit of peace and reconciliation.  

 Security 

 9. The Governments reaffirm their commitment to addressing long-term  transnational threats, including terrorism, narcotics, people smuggling and  organised crime. 

 10. The Governments will work together and with other members of the international  community to assist the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) in countering  the threat of international terrorist groups, and to promote the national security of  Afghanistan during the transition of lead responsibility for security to the  Government of Afghanistan as well as after 2014 as mutually determined. 

 11. To this end, the Governments will develop long-term cooperation on shared  national security challenges and continue to work together to build the capacity of  the ANSF and to promote international support for the ANSF.  Specific defence  cooperation arrangements will be reviewed on a regular basis and could  encompass such areas as counter-terrorism support and providing trainers and  advisors to assist building the capacity of ANSF institutions.  Beyond transition,  the range of support options may expand to include a program of defence  cooperation with opportunities for professional training in Australia.  

 12. Furthermore, the Governments reaffirm their commitment to ongoing cooperation  in conducting capacity development activities and other traditional areas of law  enforcement cooperation, which could include countering narcotics, terrorism,  people smuggling and transnational organised crime.  The specific areas of police  cooperation will be decided by the governments from time to time. 

 Development 

 13. Building on their existing record of cooperation, the Governments reaffirm their  shared vision to work together and with other members of the international  community to achieve improved development outcomes for the people of  Afghanistan. 

 14. The Governments underline their commitment to building the Government of  Afghanistan’s capacity to deliver basic services and provide economic  opportunities to the Afghan people.  Australia reaffirms that its support to  Afghanistan will be guided by the five strategic goals of the Australian  Government’s aid policy, An Effective Aid Program for Australia: saving lives;  promoting opportunities for all; sustainable economic development; effective  governance; and humanitarian and disaster response. 

 15. Australian assistance to Afghanistan will support the development priorities and  planning of the Government of Afghanistan, as set out in the proposed 2012  Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Development Cooperation between the  governments and consistent with commitments made by both Governments at the  2010 London and Kabul conferences. 

 16. Noting the unique challenges Afghanistan will face through the transition and  during the Transformation Decade, the Governments note Australia’s intention to  make long-term, substantial and predictable commitments of development  assistance to Afghanistan, in accordance with the shared responsibilities and  commitments set out in the Kabul Process and the Bonn Conference.   Commitments will be affirmed on an annual basis, taking into account progress  against the commitments made by the Governments in the MoU on Development  Cooperation. 

 17. Recognising that Afghanistan’s long-term economic growth and fiscal  sustainability will depend on the development of its productive sectors, the  Governments will cooperate to build Afghanistan’s capacity to develop and  sustainably manage its natural resources and agriculture sectors in a transparent  and effective manner. 

 18. Australia will support Afghanistan’s efforts in achieving the Millennium  Development Goals (MDGs), reducing poverty, ensuring sustainable development  through a private-sector-led market economy, and building human capacity  through improved access to and enhanced quality of education and better access to  health services. 

 19. As part of its capacity development support for the Afghan government, Australia  will continue to provide training and expertise to Afghan public officials,  including junior diplomats, in relevant Australian institutions.   

 Trade and investment 

 20. The Governments affirm the importance of an open and predictable trading  environment for economic growth and development.  Australia underlines its  support for Afghanistan’s process of accession to the World Trade Organisation as  a Least Developed Country (LDC). 

 21. Subject to the laws and regulations and investment policies in force in their  respective countries, the Governments will take such measures as may be  appropriate to strengthen and diversify bilateral trade and economic relations.  In  this regard, as Afghanistan is an LDC, Australia, subject to its customs laws, will  continue to accord duty-free, quota-free treatment to all goods originating in  Afghanistan for so long as Australia applies such treatment for least developed  countries.  Australia will also consider, as part of Australia’s broader development  assistance commitment to Afghanistan, the provision of technical assistance to  Afghanistan to support goods originating in Afghanistan to meet Australian  requirements. 

 22. The Governments will work to enhance bilateral business relations and investment  including through promotion and facilitation of  business exchanges. Both  Governments will continue to cooperate in creating a conducive environment for  Australian investment in Afghanistan.   

 Migration and humanitarian affairs 

 23. The Governments will cooperate on migration and humanitarian issues, including  as provided for in the MoU on Migration and Humanitarian Cooperation, signed  on 17 January 2011 by the Governments and the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees. 

 24. The Governments will continue efforts to address the humanitarian and livelihood  needs of internally and externally displaced Afghan nationals, including those in  neighbouring countries and on their return to Afghanistan. 

 Cultural and people-to-people links 

 25. The Governments recognise and commit to fostering the cultural and people-to-people links between Australia and Afghanistan.  The Governments will seek to  cooperate in preserving and promoting Afghanistan’s cultural heritage and to  promote direct ties between the people of Australia and Afghanistan, including  through sporting activities and cultural exhibitions. 

 26. The Governments recognise the importance of higher education for Afghanistan  and cooperation between their universities and institutions of higher education.  Australia will continue to promote educational links including through Australian  scholarships.  

 Implementation 

 27. The Governments recognise the benefits of regular bilateral meetings in building a  stronger bilateral partnership, including through Ministerial visits and meetings at  international fora, and will work together cooperatively to facilitate such  meetings. 

 28. The Governments will promote high-level visits and dialogue between the two  countries for the purpose of developing and enhancing bilateral cooperation on  issues of mutual interest. 

 29. Each Government will, pursuant to its national laws, regulations and policies,  ensure appropriate access to its territory for the employees, representatives or  contractors of the other government required to facilitate cooperation under this  Partnership. 

 Institutional arrangements 

 30. The Governments will establish a Joint Commission on Bilateral Cooperation to  review progress in implementing this Partnership and to provide a mechanism for  regular dialogue on issues of shared strategic interest.  The Joint Commission will  report to the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of both countries. 

 31. The Joint Commission will be composed of representatives of both countries and  will be chaired jointly by appropriate senior level officials.  The Joint Commission  will organise consultations on specific issues of bilateral cooperation as necessary  and may establish working groups or committees. 

 32. Commitments made under existing arrangements that are not contrary to the  content and spirit of this Partnership will be respected and may be reviewed by  both Governments as necessary.  Further specific subsidiary arrangements may be  concluded by the Governments to give effect to this Partnership. 

 33. Any dispute between the governments in the interpretation or implementation of  this Partnership will be resolved amicably through consultation, negotiation, or  such other means as may be mutually decided. 

 Final provisions 

 34. The Governments commit to a full strategic review of this Partnership in ten years  from the date of its signature. 

 35. This Partnership will take effect on the date of the later notification by the  Governments of completion of their respective domestic procedures, and will  remain in effect until terminated by either Government on six months’ notice in  writing to the other Government.  This Partnership may be amended at any time  by mutual consent of the Governments in writing.
