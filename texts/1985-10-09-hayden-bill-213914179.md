 HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE - AFGHAN REFUGEES

 The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Senator 

 Gareth Evans,  today announced that Australia would provide  $50,000 to the Australian Red Cross Society (ARC) for their  relief programs for Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

 Senator Evans said that in response to an appeal 

 by the International Committee of the Red Cross (1CRC),  Australia would provide $50,000 through the ARC to send 

 a surgical team to Peshawar.  He said that due to an 

 unprecedented number of admissions to the ICRC's hospital 

 in Peshawar, urgent relief asistance was required.

 The grant forms part of the Australian Government  humanitarian response to disaster situations throughout 

 the world and is provided from aid funds administered by  the Australian Development Assistance Bureau.
