  Afghan Refugees Arriving in Australia from Nauru 

  VPS 100/2004 

  A third group of refugees from the 146 Afghans found to be refugees by DIMIA on Nauru will  arrive in Australia by charter flight this evening. 

  Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said this group of arrivals brings to 139  the number of Afghan refugees resettled in Australia following the Government's commitment  late last year to reassess the entire Afghan caseload on Nauru in light of updated information  from the UNHCR about changed circumstances in Afghanistan. 

  'Of the 146 people reassessed by Australia to be in need of refugee protection, there are 55  children, 70 men and 2 1  women,' the Minister said. 

  'The arrival of this group follows the arrival of 35 Afghan refugees from Nauru on the 29th of  June and another 35 on the 6th of July. 

  'In the third group of 69 arriving this evening, there are 18 children, 45 men and six women. 

  'They will be resettled in Sydney, Melbourne, regional Victoria, Brisbane, Adelaide,  Launceston, Perth and the ACT. 'A number of the arrivals have family members already  residing in Australia. 

  'All of the refugees arriving this evening have been granted secondary movement visas. '51  refugees were granted three-year visas, the remaining 18 were granted five-year visas. 

  'These visas are available to people who have abandoned or by-passed effective protection in  a country of first asylum and travelled to another country to seek a preferred migration  option. 

  'Departmental officers are working with the remaining 7 Afghan refugees in the Australian  caseload on Nauru and these refugees will be resettled to Australia as soon as possible,'  Senator 'Vanstone said. 

  'The UNHCR is currently pursuing resettlement options for a further 22 Afghan refugees in  UNHCR's caseload.'
