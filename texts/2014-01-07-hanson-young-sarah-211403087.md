 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Tuesday, 7 January 2014   

 Coalition turn-back shows disregard for  lives at sea   

 The Coalition has put the lives of refugees at risk by illegally forcing a boat back to  Indonesia before it ran out of fuel, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “The Coalition’s lack of regard for the safety of refugees at sea is deeply concerning and  raises serious questions about the government’s farcical Operation Secret Boats,” the  Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “This incident so nearly ended in tragedy and, if it had, we would never have known  about it.   

 “The government’s obsession with secrecy means that we don’t know whether other  boats have been turned around illegally, with insufficient fuel, before sinking without a  trace.   

 “Scott Morrison’s refusal to explain what has happened to the Australian people is both  cowardly and dangerous.   

 “Australia’s brave service men and women are being used in an unacceptable way by  this reckless Minister. The government must end its ridiculous Operation Secret Boats  and be up front with the Australian people.”
