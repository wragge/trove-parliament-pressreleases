 Senator Brian Greig Portfolio: Law & Justice

 Dated: 20 Sep 2002 Location: Sydney

 Senator Brian Greig speaks to the Sydney Media Club

 Let me begin as Democrats traditionally do by acknowledging the Eora nation and the Gadigal clan on whose land we are meeting today.

 In my first speech in Parliament, back in 1999, I mentioned how working as a deckhand on my father's cray boat, miles out to sea in the wee hours of the morning, surrounded by rotting cow hocks and fish heads and crashing face first into strong headwinds might perhaps prepare me for a career in politics.

 Well, I can pretty safely say now that much of that is true.

 Events of the last few weeks have been very unsettling for the Democrats, our members and for our voters, I’m pleased to say that since coming to the leadership there has been a welcome calm a return to policy focus and the party room is now back in business.

 These difficult times will pass.

 Today, I want to talk about just some of Australia’s domestic responses to recent and current international circumstances.

 Fundamentally, the Australian Democrats are internationalists.

 We are supportive of international law, particularly in relation to human rights and are supportive of collective international action amongst states, particularly in the pursuit of environmental objectives and global security.

 The Australian Democrats are proudly Australia’s first and I think best environmental party. We have for 25 years advanced the cause of environmentalism throughout this country.

 I believe that ratification of the Kyoto Protocol stands before us as the first and perhaps the most pressing environmental challenge. Kyoto is not an end, but a doorway, the beginning of a journey that will involve major changes in the way we live, the way we think and the way we produce and way we consume.

 In other words, an economy that is not based on fossil fuels. The same conclusion has been reached by companies as significant as Ford, Mercedes, Toyota, BP and a number of countries.

 Moving away from our reliance on petroleum is clearly a fundamental step in Australia meeting its obligations and particularly as we move towards yet another war potentially in a world beset by conflict. Consider the implications on the geo-political landscape without oil.

 Even a cursory look at history reveals that the extent to which the international political landscape has been formed and driven by resource needs. The colonial involvement of the Dutch in the East Indies and the British, the Americans and others in the Middle East, the battle of many countries for Russian oil at the turn of the last century tells us that independence from oil reliance can only reduce the level of worldwide conflict.

 No one can plausibly deny that oil plays a central role in the current conflicts in the Middle East.

 In order for this transition away from petroleum to occur with as little pain as possible - both in economic terms and in terms of the impacts of climate change, Australia must not only take unilateral steps but must become part of a global solution.

 And no one should underestimate the threats we are facing with climate change.

 To give but one example. Both the Red Cross and the World Watch Institute have predicted that worldwide there will be 150 million environmental refugees by 2050.

 That compares with the approximately 10 million environmental refugees we currently have. It doesn’t

 take much to imagine the scale of the suffering, the scope of the displacement and the deep global instability caused by such a disaster.

 It doesn’t take an expert to recognise that Australia doesn’t have the capacity to even deal with even 1 per cent of those refugees despite the fact that Australia contributes directly to 1 per cent of all emissions.

 The ongoing refusal by the Government to sign the Kyoto Protocol is short-sighted and irresponsible. It is a refusal to act as part of the global community in which we talked about the interests of humanity.

 International Criminal Court

 The struggle for environmental sustainability is not the only great international struggle of our time. We also face the struggle for global justice.

 I was amazed to learn in 1999 that as a country there was no law against crime of genocide in Australian. Which meant Australia was very much hamstrung in terms of investigating and potentially prosecuting war criminals or those suspected of being involved in genocide but living on our shores. I introduced a Private Senator’s Bill to address this some time ago.

 That legislation was not supported by the Government or opposition.

 Yet the 20th century saw some of the most horrific atrocities in human history.

 The Simon Wiesenthal Foundation is you like a Nazi Hunter organisation based in Washington estimates that there are some 70 war criminals from Nazi Germany currently residing in Australia and recent evidence suggests there are more from Rwanda, former Yugoslavia and Cambodia and there is precious little we can do about it there is no political will to do anything.

 There is a growing recognition that the international community cannot ignore these crimes where they occur and where the perpetrators of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity can escape punishment, humanity itself is diminished.

 This issue came to the fore recently in Australia with the debate surrounding ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.

 The purpose of the International Criminal Court or the ICC is to ensure that future gross violations of international law, such as crimes against humanity and genocide, do not go unpunished.

 The ICC will provide a politically neutral forum in which gross criminal violations of human rights can be tried where normal legal avenues have been exhausted.

 History teaches us that shows that individuals responsible for serious crimes against humankind are rarely brought to justice. We have a unique opportunity to change that from this point forward.

 After massive internal turmoil within the Government, it finally ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC a curious situation in which our Government through Minister Downer was out there on the front foot initially abdicating for an ICC.

 Now it appears set to sign an agreement with the US Government to undermine the ICC.

 The US has been pedalling section 98 agreements which would give US troops or officials who have committed genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity immunity from prosecution before the ICC. This absolutely undermines the ICC, the fundamental principle of which of which is that no one should be immune from prosecution for these deplorable acts.

 The US has been threatening a number of countries with the withholding of military aid if they won’t sign the agreements.

 Laws recently passed recently by the US Congress will actually allow the US military to invade the Netherlands to free any US serviceman brought before the International Criminal Court at The Hague!

 The Australian Government has expressed agreement in principle with the idea of making an Article 98

 agreement with the US.

 The Government is expected to conclude this agreement in the near future.

 For that reason, I am announcing today that the Democrats will be bringing this issue to the attention of the Australian people, through the Senate, as a matter of priority. We cannot allow the Government to hopelessly undermine the International Criminal Court and the struggle for global justice.

 Anti-Terrorsism

 Connected I think to the issue of the ICC is the notion of Terrorists and Counter Terrorists response. Australia’s response to anti-terrorism laws has been extraordinary.

 In a raft of Bill much of which was covered extensively in the media the Government wanted unilateral powers to “proscribe” that is to name or nominate organisations as illegal and have them banned, not according to behaviour but according to what the groups believed. It was very much Reminiscent of the Communist dissolution powers under Menzies. Thankfully this move failed.

 But, the government is still seeking to allow authorities to have access to personal emails, phone calls and SMS text messages - without a warrant, and the revised ASIO legislation, while far better that the initial Bill - following heavy amending by parliamentary committee - would still allow Australian authorities to remove - that is to disappear - citizens from the streets for up to seven days, without the right to have any contact with either their employer or their family while they face and during that period they would be facing detention and questioning.

 Why is it that the Australian Government is so keen on such extraordinary anti-civil libertarian legislation, legislation that proposes to go much further than the US or Britain has done? Especially at a time when the Attorney General himself has said that “Australia is at low risk of terrorism.”

 Thankfully, it has been the Australian people who have pulled the Government into line on this matter, following considerable community outcry, the same dynamic is again occurring with the Governments’ response to the potential of war with Iraq.

 US Unilateralism

 Australia needs to be a good global citizen. We need to recognise that if we are going to do that, we cannot simply follow the US down every path it takes.

 The United States of America refuses to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. It will invalidate the International Criminal Court if it can.

 It has opposed the ban on landmines, it has refused to ratify the Rio Pact on biodiversity. It holds Australian citizens at Guantanamo Bay in an artificial legal limbo. It has laid no charges against them and will not afford them their rights under the criminal justice system. It refuses to recognise them as prisoners of war because it does not want to give them their rights under the Geneva Convention.

 Yet the Australian Government voices no objection.

 We must not support without question the emerging US unilateralism. We must recognise that the solution to global problems lies in global cooperation.

 Iraq

 Which brings me to the questions of Iraq?

 The issue of US unilateralism has come to the fore in relation to the possibility of military action against Iraq by the US.

 In response to a Democrats’ question very recently during question time, Defence Minister Senator Hill, told the Senate that Australia may commit to a war against Iraq without the support of the United Nations.

 The Australian Democrats are of the view that under current circumstances any such strike would not be

 legal. It would not qualify as self-defence under the UN Charter. The evidence that has been made available to the Australian Parliament does not come close to establishing that an attack on another country by Iraq is imminent.

 Echoing parts of the US President's speech to the UN General Assembly last Friday, Foreign Minister Downer has detailed what has been called a `decade of defiance' by Iraq, but gave no new conclusive evidence about an immediate threat from Iraq or Iraqi weapons programs.

 Certainly we welcome the fact that the foreign minister met with the Iraqi foreign minister in New York to put Australia's concerns directly to the Iraqi government. Minister Downer has previously said that US President Bush made a strong case for action against Iraq. We Democrats disagree.

 We welcome any further information that is provided by the government about Iraq and potential consequences for Australia. However, we maintain that the case has not been made and that military action is not the appropriate response.

 Recent news suggests that Iraq will now allow unfettered access for weapons inspectors.

 This news is very welcome indeed, and illustrates I think that diplomatic pressure and UN imprimatur have a very strong and continuing role in working towards peaceful outcomes.

 Clearly this can be possible with dangerous and undesirable regimes. This would appear to be a genuine diplomatic solution and is the very outcome we Democrats have been advocating throughout this difficult period.

 There is no question that the leadership of Iraq is a dangerous and undesirable regime. We acknowledge President Saddam Hussein's long record of abuse of human rights but that alone is not grounds for a military attack. The President of the United States, George W. Bush, in his address to the United Nations said:

 Liberty for the Iraqi people is a great moral cause.

 I wonder if the government would consider the liberation of Saudi Arabia and Jordan, to name but two nations, to also be great moral causes. What about North Korea? What about the liberty of the Tibetan people? What about Nigeria?

 Where was the US during the Indonesian occupation of East Timor? There is a long list of countries with appalling human rights records, many countries and many peoples longing for the sorts of rights and freedoms that we enjoy in the West and all too often take for granted.

 Taking military action against Iraq, far from enhancing UN authority, will in fact undermine it. We must not forget the action the UN is already taking against Iraq for noncompliance, particularly through sanctions.

 The Democrats have argued that a first strike is not the right response and we will point to the real and much broader threats to peace from weapons of mass destruction held by several countries.

 A first strike is an attack.

 The Democrats do not support the notion that the people of Iraq should be attacked. The result would likely be the death and injury of countless civilians—many of whom do not support the government and regime of Saddam Hussein.

 There is no evidence to suggest that military action in Iraq will bring about peace and stability in that region or bring an end to terror. We will examine whether an attack on Iraq will, in fact, enhance stability in the region and worldwide.

 The Australian Democrats maintain our long-held position that the Prime Minister must not commit Australia to a war without community and parliamentary debate, including a vote and I make the point that in recent discussion and debate in parliament came about I believe because of strong pressure from the Democrats successfully passing a motion in the senate committee in the senate to do that obviously our jurisdiction did not extend in the House of Representatives but we were out there first abdicating that community discussion was not necessary

 The Prime Minister has said in the past that he would not commit forces to a conflict without a parliamentary debate. This statement by the foreign affairs minister and statements from others in the parliament do not, of course, constitute ratification for any subsequent commitment of troops.

 It has been reported that Labour MPs will defy the British Prime Minister by forcing a Commons vote on Iraq next week. It had been intended by the Blair government that there would be no vote on the emergency debate on the Iraq crisis.

 Not only should the issue be debated fully, but Australian MPs should be given a conscience vote on the matter. This is an issue of life and death not only for Australian service personnel but for Iraqis, including Iraqi civilians.

 As recent polls have shown, Australia's support for a war against Iraq, particularly without UN approval, does not have the support of the Australian people.

 A Newspoll survey found almost 75 per cent of respondents were against a first strike on Iraq if the UN did not give approval. Almost half were against a strike under any circumstances.

 Australians are very concerned about entering into any military conflict with Iraq and very concerned that the Howard government seems too eager to join the call by America to bring this about—and quickly. Australians want this issue to be dealt with, with the utmost caution and sensitivity and are alarmed by any indication of hasty and ill-considered aggression.

 Events of this week, particularly the offer by the Iraqis to accept UN weapons inspectors, show how fluid this situation is. It emphasises the need for Parliament to keep a watching brief on it and the appropriate way to do this in part is through a Senate inquiry, as the Democrats have abdicated, but which was defeated this week.

 There has rarely been a more important moment where we have needed level-headedness and caution to be maintained.

 The prospect of war with Iraq could well mean injury and death to many thousands of people, including Australians, young Australians. We Australian Democrats expect the government to very conscious of this; indeed the Australian people demand it.

 Conclusion

 Australia faces an important decision about the sort of global citizen we want to be.

 We can be campaigners for environmental sustainability, global justice and security. We can be promoters of international law and constructive cooperation between nations for the betterment of humanity.

 We can take a humane and co-operative approach to asylum seekers and refugees.

 Or we can be a nation that stands in the way of these developments, participating only where it suits our short term interests and does not displease our allies.

 These are issues on which the Howard Government has failed to show good leadership.

 We Democrats will continue to put the alternative case to the Australian people and apply pressure to the Government to reconsider its approach to these matters.

 And we can, and should, do these things as a confident Republic - recognising our place in the world both geographically in south east Asia, and politically as a western democracy - and to embrace the extraordinary opportunities that result from both factors, that’s what the Democrats are all about, that’s our message.

 Thank you.
