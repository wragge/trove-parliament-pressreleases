 AUSTRALIA DOES NOT STAND ALONE IT SEEMS

 “Cypriot police have turned away a fishing boat carrying 35 Iraqis describing them as ‘illegal immigrants’ trying to land on their shores.  The number included 7 children”, One Nation Senator Len Harris said in Canberra today.

 “Singapore has also stated its intention not to allow refugees or immigrants there. Immigration officials  said Singapore was “in no position to accept anyone who claims to be a refugee, whether economic or political”.

 Singapore officials went on to say “to do so would open Singapore to the danger of being overwhelmed by the sheer number of people who would want to come here claiming to be refugees”.

 Hey, what about us?

 Is Australia not already overwhelmed by illegal immigrants?

 Our detention centres are full,  resources for temporary accommodation and facilities are stretched to the maximum, our Immigration officers are stressed beyond measure as they are unable to finish processing one lot before the next one is upon them, and the Australian public have overwhelmingly expressed their support that ‘THIS HAS TO STOP’.

 How many more countries are going to exert their own tough line on illegal immigrants?

 How dare the condemnation of our international neighbours come down upon us. Can they not understand that Australia at least needs a breather from the bombardment of illegals?’ Senator Harris asked.

 “Australia has not, and is not shirking from its responsibility to refugees, and will continue to meet those responsibilities, but just at the moment we have been pushed to our limits.

 “One Nation supports the Government’s present stance and asks our ‘neighbours’ accept our right to take a tough line on this one. After all, where is the support from the countries that Australia has in the past so readily assisted, and will continue to assist, when they are in distressed situations of any kind?

 “After all, what are neighbours for?   You may well ask” Len Harris said.
