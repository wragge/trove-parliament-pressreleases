 New Measures to Boost Border Protection MPS 32/2002

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today announced a series of Budget measures to enhance border protection by addressing illegal migration and people smuggling in source and transit countries.

 These measures are part of the enhanced border control initiative, which is one of the themes of the 2002-03 Federal Budget delivered by the Treasurer.

 The government has long identified the need to address the illegal movement of people at source and transit countries, as well as on our own borders," Mr Ruddock said.

 "We will do this by assisting countries of first asylum and by raising the capacity of transit countries to deal with border protection.

 "The Budget focuses on removing some of the 'push factors' from source countries as well as bolstering international efforts to deter illegal travel," Mr Ruddock said.

 The Budget provides:

 additional funding to assist the Afghan Interim Authority with the reintegration of returned Afghan asylum seekers; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» a total of up to $5.8 million over three years in personal reintegration assistance for asylum seekers who wish to go home. This includes $740,000 for non-Afghan asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island who decide to return home;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 $4 million a year to assist authorities and international organisations in transit countries to detect and intercept illegal people movement; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 up to $14.4 million a year to support international organisations responsible for detaining, processing and removing illegal migrants in transit countries as part of the Government's commitment to a Regional Co-operation Agreement. This builds on the $1.0m a year provided for this purpose from 2000-01.

 "The Budget reaffirms the Federal Government's commitment to play our part in dealing with the international issue of illegal movement of people, in part by helping alleviate the pressures which encourage people to risk illicit travel," Mr Ruddock said.

 "This includes sharing the burden with countries that are experiencing the outflow and are directly affected by illegal and irregular travel.

 "As one of only a few countries pro-actively seeking out refugees in greatest need, we are also ensuring we share the international burden," Mr Ruddock said.
