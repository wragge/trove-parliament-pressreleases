 Temporary Consulate-General In Nauru Funded For Another Year   The Australian Government will provide $0.8 million in 2005-06 to maintain Australia’s diplomatic  presence in Nauru for a further year.  

 Australia’s Consulate-General provides support for the work of government agencies involved in  processing asylum seekers and is a contact point for the Australian Government’s official dealings with  Nauru. The post also coordinates the work of Australian police and finance officials deployed to Nauru  in 2004 to assist with economic, law and justice reforms.

 Since 2002-03, the Government has allocated funding to maintain the Consulate-General on a year-by-year basis.
