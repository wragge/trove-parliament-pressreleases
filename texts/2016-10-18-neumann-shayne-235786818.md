 SHAYNE NEUMANN MP 

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR    

 ASYLUM SEEKERS SHOULD BE TREATED WITH RESPECT    

 The recent release of Amnesty International’s report into offshore processing in  Nauru Island of Despair and the ABC’s Four Corners last night highlight key failures  of the Turnbull Government’s policies and treatment of asylum seekers living on  Manus Island and on Nauru.    

 Asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru have been there too long.    

 People should not languish in indefinite detention because the Prime Minister and  Minister have failed to secure durable third country resettlement options for these  people.    

 Labor’s policy is clear, we believe in strong borders, offshore processing and boat  turn backs when it’s safe to do so because we know it saves lives. But we do not  believe offshore facilities should be run as punitive holding cells.     

  This is a stark difference between the policies of the Turnbull Government and  Labor.    

 Labor believes in a humane and compassionate approach which enables refugees to  progress their claims safely and securely.      

 Labor wants to see:   

 ï·ï Re-engagement and increased funding to the UNHCR;  ï·ï Greater transparency by establishing bilateral mechanisms to support the  independent oversight of Australian funded offshore detention;   ï·ï Third country resettlement arrangements secured as a matter of priority;  ï·ï Appointment of an independent children’s advocate to pursue the best interests 

 of children; and   ï·ï An increase in Australia’s humanitarian intake to 27,000 by 2025.     

 We have a responsibility to investigate serious claims about any mistreatment of  asylum seekers in offshore processing centre.    

 Labor has initiated a Senate Inquiry to investigate serious allegations of abuse, self-harm and neglect outlined in the Nauru files.  That Inquiry will report back by the last  sitting day in March 2017.    

 Asylum seekers living in these facilities need a clear third country resettlement  arrangement. The inability to achieve this has been another failure of the Turnbull  Government.
