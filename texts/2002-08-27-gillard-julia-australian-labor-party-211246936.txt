 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 MINISTER SHOULD PUT HIS MONEY WHERE HIS MOUTH IS

 Minister Ruddock yesterday ‘welcomed’ the extension of tax deductibility status for gifts to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  The Minister then urged Australians to make a donation to the organisation.

 Given the Government slashed UNHCR’s core funding in the May Budget by 50% from $14 million per year to $7.3 million per year, I am not surprised that the Minister is encouraging Australians to open their wallets and pick up where he and his Government left off.

 No doubt the Minister will respond by highlighting the additional $14.3 million provided in the May Budget for ‘special programs’, arguing that this represents an increase in funding levels for UNHCR.

 However the additional $14.3 million is available only for those programs approved by the Minister, a situation that reduces the capacity of UNHCR to genuinely respond to international refugee issues with autonomy on the basis of previously established criteria and needs.

 The Howard Government should restore previous levels of funding to UNHCR so that the generous donations of Australians add to the pool of funds, not fill in the black hole created by the Government’s cuts.
