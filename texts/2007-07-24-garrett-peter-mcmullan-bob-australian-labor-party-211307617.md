 SHADOW MINISTER FOR CLIMATE CHANGE, ENVIRONMENT AND  HERITAGE  PETER GARRETT MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT 

 ASSISTANCE  BOB MCMULLAN MP 

 ASSISTING OUR SOUTH PACIFIC NEIGHBOURS PREPARE   FOR CLIMATE CHANGE 

 A Rudd Labor Government will commit $150 million from Australia’s international aid  budget to assist our neighbours prepare for and adapt to the effects of climate change.  

 Experts warn that the impact of climate change, particularly through rising sea levels,  could lead to the submergence of tiny atolls and the inundation of low lying land - and  that by 2050 up to 150 million people may be displaced.  

 Given the large number of small, low elevation islands in the southwest Pacific, the  impact of climate change on migration patterns in our own region is very real. Tuvalu has  already begun negotiating migration rights with New Zealand as a result of climate  change.  

 Federal Labor is committed to working with our neighbours to develop and implement  climate change adaptation plans to minimise the impacts on our region. 

 Federal Shadow Minister for Climate Change, Environment and Heritage, Peter Garrett,  Shadow Minister for International Development Assistance, Bob McMullan, and Labor  Candidate for Wentworth, George Newhouse, launched the policy today at Bondi Beach. 

 “The poorest countries that are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change are  also those that have the least financial capacity to respond,” Bob McMullan said. 

  “As a developed country in a region, Australia has an obligation to help our poorer  neighbours prepare for and adapt to these and other impacts of climate change,” Bob  McMullan said. “Unless we help our neighbours adapt and act to avoid the worst impacts  of climate change, the world will see millions of climate change refugees.” 

 As part of its International Development Assistance and Climate Change commitment a  Rudd Labor Government will: 

  Increase aid expenditure on climate change by $150 million over 3 years to fund  initiatives on adaptation to climate change - with a priority on Pacific Islands and East  Timor;   Assist countries to develop climate change adaptation plans, particularly low lying 

 countries and those susceptible to extreme weather events;   Ensure climate change is a key consideration in the design of Australia’s aid  program;   Develop a Pacific Climate Change Strategy; 

  Build capacity for avoided deforestation and better forest management in the Asia  Pacific;    Share Australia’s scientific and technology expertise in climate change;   Ensure that the aid program also promotes the use of low carbon emitting 

 technologies;    Increase support for NGOs that assist with the implementation of this new approach;  and    Participate in multilateral and bilateral programs of assistance. 

 “Australia’s continued refusal to ratify the Kyoto protocol means Australia cannot play a  direct role in ensuring the allocation of funding under  the protocol’s Adaptation Fund to  countries in our region.  Labor will redress that by ratifying the Kyoto protocol,” Peter  Garrett said.      

 Major Australian aid and environment NGOs released a report last year ‘Australia  Responds - Helping our Neighbours Fight Climate Change”  that warned that efforts to  end poverty among our poorest neighbours will fail unless the Australian Government  takes urgent action to tackle climate change and prepare for its effects.   

 Leading international reports - including the UK Stern Review and the 2007 Assessment  reports of the UN’s expert Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - also  highlighted the need for wealthier nations to assist poorest countries:   

  “The poorest developing countries will be hit earliest and hardest by climate  change, even though they have contributed little to causing the problem.  

 Their low incomes make it difficult to finance adaptation. The international  community has an obligation to support them in adapting to climate change.  Without such support there is a serious risk that development progress will  be undermined.”  (Stern Review, 2006) 

 The World Resources Institute estimates that developed, industrialised countries are  responsible for 76 per cent of the world’s historical emissions and their 2000 emissions  at 14.1 tons per person (excluding land use change) were four times higher than  developing countries, which emit an average of 3.3 tons per person.  

 Projected climate change impacts on developing countries include:    Increased drought in Africa - the critical water shortages in Darfur were cited in this  context in a June 2007 report of the UN Environment Program;   Retreating glaciers in the Himalayas resulting in significantly increasing water 

 shortages in India and China;   Inundation of coastal areas with sea level rises, including heavily populated mega-delta regions of Bangladesh and the Mekong as well as a number of the smaller 

 Pacific Island countries.   

 Climate change is also predicted to:   Degrade forests, fish, pastures and crop land that many poor families depend on;   Damage poor people’s homes, water supply, and health;    Reduce the quality and quantity of drinking water, and exacerbate malnutrition 

 among children, particularly in sub- Saharan Africa; 

  Lead to more deaths and illness due to heat-waves, floods, droughts and hurricanes;  and;   Increase the prevalence of diseases spread by mosquitoes, like malaria and dengue  fever.    

 " Peter Garrett and Bob McMullan praised the efforts of George Newhouse in raising  awareness of the impacts of climate change on coastal communities".
