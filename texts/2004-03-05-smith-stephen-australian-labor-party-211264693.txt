 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - COMMONWEALTH  PARLIAMENTARY OFFICES, SYDNEY, FRIDAY, 5 MARCH 2004   

 

 SUBJECT: Boat arrival on Ashmore Reef, Liberal Leadership   

 SMITH: Amanda  Vanstone  can  barely  contain  her  glee  that  Australia’s  borders  have  

 been breached again.  This is the third occasion during this parliament where a boat has 

 arrived  on  Australian  territory  undetected.   And  Minister  Vanstone  is  embarrassingly  

 admitting that she has no idea where the boat came from, what the purpose of the boat 

 was about.   

 

 This is the third time, as I say, that a boat has breached our borders undetected.  Where is 

 the surveillance?  Where is the intelligence?  The government says it’s strong on border 

 protection.  The truth is it’s incompetent on border protection. 

 

 So, Amanda Vanstone, instead of gleefully trying to be political and somehow trying to 

 blame  the  Labor  Party,  ought  to  tell  the  Australian  people  where  the  boat  came  from,  

 what  the  purpose  of  the  boat  was,  what  will  happen  to  the  people  on  board,  whether  

 there’s still a boat there. 

 

 Remember  on  the  last  occasion  that  a  boat  reached  Australian  territory,  the  Howard  

 government sent the people smugglers back.  They sent them back to ply their evil trade 

 again.   We  say  you've  got  to  properly  protect  our  borders  through  a  Coastguard,  and  

 when  you  apprehend  people  smugglers,  you  try  them,  sentence  them  to  long  sentences  

 and  if  there  are  asylum  seekers  who  have  landed  on  Ashmore  Reef,  under  Labor’s  

 approach, they will be taken to Christmas Island and processed there in accordance with 

 UNHCR standards. 

 

 Let me just make this point about Amanda Vanstone’s glee.  I wonder whether Amanda 

 Vanstone  being  political  rather  than  trying  to  competently  protect  our  borders  has  

 anything to do with the trouble that the Liberal Party finds itself in today and yesterday? 

 

 We've got John Howard refusing to say whether he will serve an entire term if he’s re-elected, we’ve got Peter Costello refusing to say whether he will challenge Mr Howard 

 and  we've  got  the  Liberal  Party  polling  being  leaked  indicating  that  they  have  some  

 serious political troubles. 

 

 So,  why  can’t  John  Howard  simply  be  open  and  honest  with  the  Australian  people  and  

 tell them whether he’s proposing to serve a full term?  Why can’t Peter Costello tell us 

 whether  he’s  proposing  to  challenge  Mr  Howard  either  before  the  election  or  after  the  

 election if they’re re-elected.  The Australian people are entitled to know whether a vote 

 for John Howard is a vote for John Howard or whether a vote for John Howard is a vote 

 for Peter Costello. 

 

 JOURNALIST:  Getting back to this issue, what do you say Labor … what should be  

 done with the people that … now that they have arrived? 

 

 SMITH: Well firstly, not even the Minister knows where the boat came from, how it 

 got there, who the people are, what their country or nation of origin is.  So, the first thing 

 that is required is for the Government to say how the boat got here, how surveillance and 

 intelligence was breached yet again, where the people come from and how we will deal 

 with them.  

 

 If  it  is  the  case  that  these  people  are  asylum  seekers,  under  Labor’s  approach,  those  

 people  would  be  taken  to  Christmas  Island,  they  would  be  detained  and  processed  at  

 Christmas  Island,  and  they  would  be  processed  at  Christmas  Island  in  accordance  with  

 UNHCR  standards  either  by  the  UNHCR  itself  or  by  Australian  officials  acting  in  

 accordance with UNHCR procedures. 

 

 JOURNALIST:  So,  that’s  what  you’d  like  to  see  happen,  not  being  put  in  a  boat  and  

 shipped back to wherever they came from? 

 

 SMITH:  Well,  I  don’t  know  whether  the  people  on  the  boat  are  people  smugglers,  

 asylum seekers because the government can’t tell us.  We don’t, for example, know how 

 long the people have been there.  We don’t know whether there’s a boat there or whether 

 a boat has dropped the people off and returned. 

 

 So, the first thing that is required is for the government firstly to explain to the Australian 

 public where the boat came from, how it got there and why we've seen for a third time 

 this  Parliament  a  breach  of  our  borders.   Where  was  the  Coastwatch?   Where  was  

 Coastguard?   Where  was  the  Government’s  so-called  operation  patrolling  our  northern  

 borders?   And  we  know  from  information  obtained  at  Senate  estimates  that  the  

 government has cut back on that particular operation. 

 

 So, the starting point is not what Labor would do with these people.  The starting point 

 here is how did they get there in the first place and what circumstances are they in?  If, in 

 the hypothetical, these people are asylum seekers, under Labor’s approach, they will be 

 taken to Christmas Island and processed as asylum seekers in accordance with UNHCR 

 standards. 

 

 JOURNALIST:  With  an  election  only  a  few  months  away,  is  it  your  concern  that  the  

 government may just be trying to turn this into an election issue? 

 

 SMITH: Well, there is no doubt that Senator Vanstone yesterday and today is crassly 

 trying to win the next election by re-running the last one.  Last night when she announced 

 the  presence  of  the  boat  there  was  nothing  there  to  indicate  what  information  the  

 government  had  about  the  boat.   It  was  simply  a  crass  argument  that  somehow  it  was  

 Labor’s fault. 

 

 And  so  there’s  no  doubt  that  given  the  government  is  going  through  the  odd  political  

 difficulty at this stage, particularly with Mr Costello being silent as to his intentions so far 

 as Mr Howard is concerned, particularly Mr Howard refusing to tell the Australian people 

 whether he will serve a full term if re-elected -  no wonder they’re out there for the odd 

 distraction which has served them well in the past. 

 

 But I simply make this point.  The government says that it is strong on border protection.  

 The  truth  is  it  is  incompetent.   This  is  the  third  occasion  this  parliament  we’ve  seen  a  

 breach of our borders, a breach of our territories.  Where was the surveillance?  Where 

 was the coast watch?  Where was the coast guard?  That’s why we say, the best way to 

 protect and defend our borders is being effective in those areas. 

 

 Senator  Vanstone  is  also  out  there  saying  this  proves  the  case  that  further  parts  of  

 Australia ought to be excised from our migration zone.  We support strongly the excision 

 of Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Island and Ashmore Reef because they sit there as a 

 magnet to people smugglers and we will smash the people smugglers. 

 

 The other excisions which the government either presents to the parliament or presents to 

 the media are simply the modern day equivalent of the Brisbane Line.  Surrendering our 

 territory to people smugglers, surrendering our sovereignty.  Whereas the most effective 

 way  of  protecting  our  borders  is  not  through  the  pretence  of  legal  technicalities  or  by  

 surrendering  our  territory  to  people  smugglers;  it’s  by  making  sure  we’ve  got  effective  

 intelligence,  effective  surveillance  and  effective  arrangements  with  our  neighbours  to  

 deter secondary movements of asylum seekers and to smash the people smugglers. 

 

 Our approach is to have those arrangements in place, to have harsh penalties for people 

 smugglers and when they come here to arrest them, try them in Australia, sentence them 

 to harsh penalties up to life imprisonment for the worst sorts of offences.  Not to do what 

 the  government  did  on  the  last  occasion  was  to  send  them  back  scot-free  so  that  they  

 could ply their evil trade again. 

 

 JOURNALIST:   Did  you  say  though  that,  that  whole  discussion  about  Melville Island 

 and the undermining of the Senate to overturn the excise, may have given that message 

 that it’s okay to try (indistinct)? 

 

 SMITH:  It’s  a  complete  nonsense.   Cocos  (Keeling)  Island,  Christmas  Island,  

 Ashmore  Reef  are  excised  from  Australia’s  migration  zone  as  they  should  be,  we  say,  

 because  they  stand  there  as  magnets  to  people  smugglers  because  they’re  closer  to  

 Indonesia than to mainland Australia. 

 

 The  suggestion  that  there  should  be  further  excisions  of  islands  closer  to  our  coast  line  

 and  contiguous  with  our  coastline,  or  Senator  Vanstone’s  suggestion  that  the  migration  

 zone  should  be  moved  from  the  low  water  mark  to  the  high  water  mark  is  simply  the  

 modern equivalent of the Brisbane Line.  Surrendering our territory to people smugglers, 

 actually providing an incentive for them to come closer rather than to stay away.   

 

 So,  we  say  it’s  sensible  to  excise  Christmas,  Cocos  (Keeling)  and  Ashmore  Reef  but  

 anything  else  is  simply  a  surrendering  by  way  of  legal  technicality.   It’s  much  more  

 important,  much  more  effective  to  be  out  there  with  the  surveillance,  with  the  

 intelligence; with the arrangements with our neighbours, to stop the boats from coming in 

 the first place.   

 

 And  if  they  do  come  to  arrest  the  people  smugglers  and  sentence  them  in  Australian  

 courts and give them harsh penalties for the deeds that they have done. 

 Thank you.
