 In addition, I addressed a lunch hosted by the Malaysia-Australia   Business Council (the text of w hich  has already been released)   and I received a briefing at the Malaysian Industrial Development   Authority.

 Before leaving Kuala L u m p u r ,  I visited the Sungei Besi refugee   transit camp. I saw at first hand the living conditions in the   camp and met w i t h  refugees t h e r e , some of w ho m  were to be r e ­

 settled in Australia.

 In S i n g a p o r e , I had lengthy and most rewarding meetings w it h the   Prime M i n i s t e r , Mr Lee Kuan Y e w , and First Deputy Prime M i n i s t e r ,   Mr Goh Chok Tong.

 These discussions focussed particularly on regional security   issues including Cambodia, China and the US strategic presence   (including the recent upgrading of operations from Singapore).   We also addressed refugee and regional defence arrangements  

 (including F P D A ) .

 I r aised specifically w ith Mr Goh the restrictions currently   imposed by Singapore on press f r e e d o m .

 I g reatly benefitted from the exchange of views I had with the   Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, concerning the prospects for   Singapore, Australia and the region as a whole. His leadership   of Singapore over such a long p eriod of time makes his insights   e specially valuable and I had a most stimulating discussion with   him.

 W hi le in S i n g a p o r e , 1 also addressed a lunch jointly hosted by   the Singapore Australia Business Council and the Foreign   C orrespondents Association (the text of w hich has already been   released). Before leaving S i n g a p o r e , I addressed a seminar of   academic experts at the Institute of South East Asian Studies at   the National U n i v e r s i t y .
