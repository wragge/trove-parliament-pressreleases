 Media Release // Senator Peter Whish-Wilson 

 Potential Coalition-Greens unity ticket on whaling this Summer 

 As Greens spokesperson on whaling, Senator Peter Whish-Wilson received a tour of the Sea  Shepherd vessel in Hobart today, he took the unusual step of pointing out the areas of agreement  with the Environment Minister on whaling policy. 

 “The Greens agree with the coalition government that Australia must send its purpose-built patrol  vessel, the Ocean Protector, to the Southern Ocean this summer. We were surprised that the  coalition made this a high-profile election commitment. 

 “I agree with Greg Hunt that previous Australian governments have not done enough to stop  whaling in our Southern waters. I agree with Greg Hunt that when the Japanese conduct whaling  in our waters, they impinge upon our sovereignty. 

 “And when it comes to the Sea Shepherd role, I agree with Greg Hunt that with an unpatrolled  Southern Ocean, the Sea Shepherd is having to do the governments work. 

 “The problem we have right now is that the Ocean Protector is currently on Asylum Seeker patrol  duties. I want to know when our Antarctic patrol boat is going to leave Christmas Island and head  south to Macquarie Island. 

 "Frankly, the Japanese fleet need to do the right thing, bugger off and leave our whales alone" he  concluded.
