 PRESS STATEMENT

 SRI LANKAN AND LEBANESE - EXTENSIONS OP STAY

 The announcement that Sri Lankan and Lebanese citizens temporarily  in Australia on 31st July 1990 would be permitted to extend their  temporary stay until 31st October 1990 rather than return home, at  this time seems reasonable given the Government's assessment of the  current security situation in both places.

 Australia has always responded sympathetically where visitors and  temporary residents might be returning to a situation in which  their life would be at risk through civil disturbance.

 The Minister's comment that the extension should be considered as  interim only is appropriate, if he is speaking about the situation  abroad having changed for the better. His suggestion that in  future people who believe they had humanitarian grounds for  extending their stay need to explore options available through new 

 asylum procedures has grave implications for Lebanese and Sri  Lankan nationals if the situation in both places remains the same  or deteriorates.

 New asylum procedures only apply to refugees and refugee claims are  not available where the formal criteria are not satisfied. The  Minister's statement leaves unanswered how Australia can respond on  humanitarian grounds where the circumstances do not involve 

 Government imposed oppression.

 A sound immigration law cannot be put in place through continued  ad hoc decision making and extensions of time.
