 Act now on detention reforms and save budget bottom line: Greens    

 The government should use the budget in May as an opportunity to start implementing the  recommendations made in the Parliamentary report into Australia's detention network released this  week, the Australian Greens said today.    

 “Putting time limits on detention and shutting down remote centres would help save hundreds of  millions of dollars from the public purse,” Greens' immigration spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, said.    

 “At a time when the Gillard Government is looking for budget savings, cutting spending on  unnecessary detention would be a sensible thing to do.     

 “The Immigration Minister has said he will respond to the report by September, but some of those  suffering the damage of detention, including the 250 people who have been detained longer than  two years, cannot afford to wait six months.    

 “The government should start to act on the recommendations as part of the May Budget.    

 “The government must stop wasting money on a system that has not just a human toll but costs the  Australia tax-payer billions of dollars.    

 “Implementing a fairer, practical and humane system will be better for the Budget and better for the  small number of asylum seekers who have fled war and persecution and arrived on our doorstep  asking for help.”
