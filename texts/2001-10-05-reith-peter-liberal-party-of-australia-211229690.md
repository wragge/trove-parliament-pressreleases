 SPEECH The Hon. Peter Reith, MP Minister for Defence

  

 05 Oct 2001 MIN 51001/01

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON PETER REITH MP

 DOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]

 REITH:

 The Prime Minister yesterday outlined the availability of Australian Defence Force personnel. The availability in total numbers is about 1,000 ADF personnel. That comprises the SAS squadron of about 150. We already have a ship in the Persian Gulf on interdiction duties in respect of sanctions which has a crew of 184 or thereabouts, say 200 for these purposes. And that ship will be replaced and that, of course, relieves the US from providing a ship so that is an important contribution. We are also having available two 707s and the total complement required for that operation would be about 100 RAAF personnel including ground crew. In respect of maritime surveillance aircraft we are similarly looking at two aircraft and likewise about 100 personnel would be associated with that.

 So the SAS - 150, the existing ship - 200, the RAAF - 200. In addition to that we are looking at having an amphibious command ship in the region and that has a crew of about 200 although it could have a few more on board and in that event we would have an escort frigate which would also have around a complement 200. That brings you close to 1000.

 We do also have, and they should not be forgotten, some Australians on exchange in units in the UK and the US and we have authorised those personnel to deploy with their respective units in the event that those units are called in to service.

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]

 REITH:

 Well, around about. It gives you a pretty good idea of the likely Australian involvement.

  

  

 JOURNALIST:

 The Prime Minister said this morning that he has told a few close colleagues when the election date will be. Has he told you?

 REITH:

 Well, all matters about the election are matters for the Prime Minister.

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]

 REITH:

 Well, as I say all matters are for the Prime Minister.

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]

 REITH:

 The position is that the ANZUS Treaty has been invoked at the request of the Prime Minister. The Chief of the Defence Force has met with his counterpart and they have had a detailed discussion about the sort of contributions that Australia can effectively provide. And the CDF has advised the Prime Minister accordingly and obviously any deployment is still subject to further discussions and obviously would also be subject to operational security at the time.

 JOURNALIST:

 And would the Australian Forces be under the overall command of the US or….

 REITH:

 Well, they would obviously fit within the Coalition arrangements but there would be an Australian national command and the deployment of HMAS MANOORA or KANIMBLA would certainly facilitate that although it’s not essential but we think could be a useful contribution to the Australian contingent.

 JOURNALIST:

 Are there any reports of more refugees on the way?

 REITH:

 Look, I can’t give you an update on that. Obviously we are pleased that the MANOORA exercise has now been completed and she’s now able to steam back to Australia. Tobruk is still

 enroute to Nauru. We have the [inaudible] agreement of Nauru to take those 252. And arrangements are well advanced for the reception of those people in Nauru.

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]

 REITH:

 You can’t understate the seriousness of this. Obviously the SAS involvement will be an important contribution for Australia to make and the military situation that they could face could be a very difficult one and you can’t obviously rule out the possibility of our people coming in harms way. So it is a very serious matter but at the same time I think there is an appreciation that the circumstances justify Australian involvement and we can be reassured to the extent that our people are very well trained. They have internationally a very good reputation built on the expertise which is within that unit, within that regiment.

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible] better chance of re-election, do you regret your decision to leave politics?

 REITH:

 I am just focussed on doing the job. I mean, I made the decision a while ago and that decision obviously sticks. But from my point of view there are very serious issues to be dealt with at the present time and I am just keeping all my attentions focussed on doing the job as Defence Minister.

 JOURNALIST:

 If the Government is re-elected [inaudible]…..

 REITH:

 The Government has, I think, a very good structure in place. We put in place the National Security Committee of Cabinet when we came into office. We have very strong leadership at the military level, at the departmental level and, of course, the Prime Minister Chairs the National Security Committee and that gives you continuity. We also have a very strong policy position. The White Paper that we brought down last year provides a blueprint for Defence in the years ahead. It’s also provided us with more options in the future for governments to deploy the Australian Defence Force. If you go back to 1996 the fact is in 1996 we would not have been able to undertake the East Timor operation but the reforms that were then commenced have through till now seen a significant increase in the percentage of the Australian Defence Force personnel available for combat or combat support roles. In fact, that percentage of the totality of the Defence Force available for such roles has gone from 42 per cent to 62 per cent. So we are in a much stronger position as a result of the reforms. And I think the Defence Force is better equipped today and better resourced and better organised than they have been for many years.

 JOURNALIST:

 [Inaudible]

 REITH:

 Well, we have a longstanding close relationship with the United States which is a very important national asset for Australia, namely the ANZUS Treaty. And the fact is that for wherever you are the events of September 11 have changed the world in a way obviously in which we regret but requires us to face the reality of those changed circumstances and it is important that Australia is ready and prepared and willing to play its role in combating terrorism. Not to do so I think would be an even more brave circumstance for Australia in the future.
