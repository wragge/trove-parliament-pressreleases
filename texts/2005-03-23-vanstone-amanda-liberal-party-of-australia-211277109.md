 Broader Powers for Immigration Minister to Manage Long Term  Detainees and Removals

 VPS 046/2005

 Minister for Immigration, Amanda Vanstone, today announced new measures to manage the cases of long term immigration detainees.

 ‘The Government will introduce regulation changes to the Migration Regulations as soon as practicable to create a new class of Bridging visa (to  be known as The Removal Pending Bridging Visa), which will provide greater ability to manage the cases of long term detainees who are awaiting  removal,’ the Minister said.

 ‘Although most unlawful non-citizens spend very short periods in detention before departing Australia, there are some who can remain in detention  for extended periods because a variety of reasons make their speedy removal difficult. The key element of our policy to remove people with no  lawful basis to remain in Australia remains unaffected by these new measures.

 ‘It is important to remember that approximately 9 500 people who arrived unauthorised by boat have been released into the community after being  found to be in need of refugee protection. The cases affected by these new measures relate to those found not to be refugees.

 ‘The Government recognises that for that small number of cases where removal is not possible in the short term, other options should be explored.

 ‘The new Bridging visa will only be granted to a relatively small number of detainees where the Minister believes it is not reasonably practicable to  achieve removal in the short term and where the detainee undertakes to cooperate fully with removal from Australia, once that becomes  practicable.

 ‘Detainees receiving the new Bridging Visa would have access to a limited range of social support benefits. The benefits provided are the same as  the 18-month Return Pending Visa announced last year for TPV holders who do not secure either a further protection visa or mainstream migration  visa.

 ‘The new Bridging Visa would include a regular reporting requirement.’

 The Minister said she was satisfied that the new measures would provide more flexibility for the Government in dealing with the small number of  individuals where there are more complex removal problems while maintaining our commitment to mandatory detention and our highly successful  measures to deter people smuggling.

 ‘The new bridging visa will not be available to detainees with current visa applications, or who are challenging decisions, either through review or  courts,’ the Minister said.

 ‘The new bridging visa category does not apply to failed asylum seekers on Nauru. Management of that caseload remains completely separate from  onshore cases.

 ‘The Government’s offshore strategy to deter people smuggling has been effective. For example, unauthorised boat arrivals have virtually ceased.  It is important that to protect our border we remain vigilant and send no signal to people smugglers that would lead to a resurgence of the regular  boat arrivals experienced between 1999 and 2002.’

 Basic Requirements for Access to the Removal Pending Bridging Visa

 The Removal Pending Bridging Visa requires the making of regulations to come into effect. 

 The Government intends that access will be determined on an individual basis and limited to those immigration detainees who 

 â     do not have any visa applications or litigation outstanding;

 the Minister believes it is not reasonably practicable to remove for the time being; â     the Minister believes have done everything possible to facilitate their removal from Australia; and

 â     have agreed in writing to abide by all prescribed conditions, and cooperate fully with arrangements for their removal from Australia, 

 including leaving Australia when advised to do so.

 In relation to any Removal Pending Bridging Visa granted, it is intended that:

 â     the visa may be ceased when removal can be arranged; 

 â     and the holder would be required to report regularly to the Department.

 Access to the visa is not merits reviewable. The visa does not allow family reunion, and does not provide re-entry rights if the holder leaves  Australia.

 Social support benefits associated with the Removal Pending Bridging Visa

 Removal Pending Bridging Visa holders will be entitled to the same social support as Temporary Protection Visa holders and Return Pending Visa  holders, such as:

 â     Work Rights and Job Matching;

 â     Access to Medicare benefits; 

 â     Eligibility for: 

 â     Special Benefits; 

 â     Rent Assistance; 

 â     Maternity Allowance; 

 â     Maternity Immunisation; 

 â     Public Education for school aged minors; 

 â     Mutual Obligation (after receiving income support for six months); 

 â     Child Care Benefit; 

 â     Family Tax Benefit; 

 â     Double Orphan Pension; and 

 â     Torture and trauma counselling; 

 â     Health Care Card; 

 â     Access to the Early Health Assessment and Intervention (EHAI) services;

 â     Access to the English as a Second Language Service for school aged minors
