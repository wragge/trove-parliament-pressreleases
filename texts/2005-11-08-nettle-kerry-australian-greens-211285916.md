 Greens fax Refugee Visa Applications to HMAS  Geraldton  

 8th Nov 2005 

 

 Protection visa application forms were faxed to the Captain of the  HMAS Geraldton, via the Northern Command Naval Base HMAS  Coonawarra, by Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today.   

 Senator Nettle requested that these forms be passed on to the seven  people who arrived in the Kimberleys on Sunday night and are still  being held by Australian authorities.   

 "I'm concerned that the Department of Immigration may not be  properly informing these people of their rights to apply for refugee  status," Senator Nettle said.   

 "I have asked the Captain of HMAS Geraldton to pass these important  documents to the people he is escorting so they can decide if they  need to apply for protection visas themselves.    

 "I have sent this fax because so far the Government has failed to show  that they take their responsibilities towards people arriving in Australia  by boat seriously.    

 "I am confident that the Navy will ensure that the seaworthiness of the  vessel and the safety of the men women and infants will be paramount  in any action they take," Senator Nettle said
