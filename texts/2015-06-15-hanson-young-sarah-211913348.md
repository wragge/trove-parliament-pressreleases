 MEDIA RELEASE    

 

 Monday 15 June 2015    

 

 AUSTRALIAN GREENS HAVE WRITTEN TO AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE  REQUESTING INVESTIGATION    

 The Australian Greens have today written to the Australian Federal Police asking them  to investigate if any payments have been made to crews of boats carrying asylum  seekers and if so what laws have been violated. An Order to Produce Documents motion  will also be moved in the Senate today for the government to release all documents  relating to any payments made.   

 “I have written to the Australian Federal Police today asking them to investigate if the  government has violated Australian laws on people trafficking, people smuggling and  money laundering,” Greens spokesperson for Immigration Senator Sarah Hanson-Young  said.    

 "The allegations must be dealt with immediately and the Greens will use whatever  means it can, including the powers of the Senate to force the Government to come  clean.    

 "The Greens will also move an Order to Produce Documents today in the Senate, forcing  the Government to reveal what has occurred out on the high seas and whether tax payer  funds were spent paying off the crews of asylum seeker boats    

 "Paying cash bribes to boat crews amounts to people trafficking.  The Government does  not have a mandate to break the law or a blank cheque to allow handing over wads of  cash in the middle of the ocean.
