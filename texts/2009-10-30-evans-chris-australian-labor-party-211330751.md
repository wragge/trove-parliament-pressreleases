 Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of  Australia (FECCA) conference 

 30 October 2009 

 Shepparton Vic. 

 Firstly, I would like to formally acknowledge the traditional owners  and custodians of these lands and pay my respects to their elders,  both past and present. 

 It is apt that the theme of your conference is on strengthening  multiculturalism and building social inclusion. 

 It has not been a great week for social inclusion. Sadly, we have  seen the return of a divisive debate which lacks any evidence-based framework or perspective on the public policy challenge. It  is the sort of debate which I had hoped we had put behind us. 

 This week we have seen various politicians make comments that  raise the threat of disease, terrorism, abuse of welfare payments  and Muslim migration and settlement. 

 Some of that commentary came from former Immigration Minister,  Kevin Andrews, who should know better. Mr Andrews knows that  Australia's migration program does not discriminate on the basis  of race or religion.  

 His government had a large, non-discriminatory migration and  humanitarian program which doubled the Muslim population of  Australia. 

 To raise doubts about Muslim settlement in the midst of this  week’s refugee debate can only have been deliberate and  designed to promote discord. 

 We, as a government will defend the changes we have made in  immigration policy. We have maintained tough border protection  measures while implementing a more humane system of treating  asylum seekers. 

 We are not a government that supports open borders as some  advocates do. We have a responsibility to control our borders and  manage those seek entry to our country. Australians rightly  respect that the government will only allow authorised entry and  orderly migration within a system with integrity.  

 The Rudd Government is committed to that strong border security  and management. We believe that this is not inconsistent with a  strong commitment to refuge resolution and resettlement and the  humane treatment of those who have come seeking our  protection.

 And we think that is a better reflection of Australia's values. 

 I don't think anyone is arguing, even the Liberal Party, even Philip  Ruddock, that we go back to locking kids up behind barbed wire,  separating them from their families and leaving people in long-term, indefinite detention so they become so desperate as they  seek to self-harm. 

 Since coming to office we have increased our funding assistance  to international agencies including UNHCR and the International  Organization for Migration (IOM) and increased our engagement  with other regional nations, Indonesia in particular. 

 This has included working to resolve Indonesia’s protracted  caseloads in partnership with other countries, including New  Zealand. 

 But the focus on what happens in Indonesia has meant that scant  attention has been paid to how those arrangements with Indonesia  fit with the international protection system for refugees and  Australia’s contribution to that. 

 Some have claimed that to do anything other than accept  immediate resettlement of anyone claiming asylum in Indonesia is  to abandon our commitment to the Refugee Convention and  humanity. 

 That is complete nonsense and ignores the reality of the  challenge. 

 At the end of 2008 there were 42 million forcibly displaced people  worldwide, including 15.2 million refugees.  

 Developing countries hosted 8.4 million refugees, or 80 per cent of  the global refugee population. The 49 least developed countries  provided asylum to 18 per cent. One third of all refugees were  residing in the Asia and Pacific region. 

 That is the enormity of the problem and that is the reality. 

 Some of the most important refugee hosting countries in the world  are developing countries that are not parties to the Refugees  Convention. At the end of 2008, Pakistan hosted the largest 

 number of refugees in the world, with 1.8 million refugees, virtually  all from Afghanistan. Syria was host to 1.1 million Iraqi refugees,  making it the second largest refugee hosting country at year end. 

 In our region there are tens of thousands of refugees in Thailand  and a relatively small number in Indonesia.  Again, those countries  are not parties to the Refugees Convention but both work with  UNHCR and facilitate the resettlement of refugees to third  countries. 

 For most refugees the best solution is to be able to return to their  home country when it is safe. 

 According to UNHCR, voluntary repatriation to their home country  is a durable solution which has historically benefited the largest  number of refugees.

 Regrettably it can often be many years until voluntary repatriation  is possible.  

 UNHCR estimates that some 5.7 million refugees are living in a  situation of protracted displacement, having spent five years or  more in exile.  

 Where voluntary repatriation or local integration in the country of  asylum are not viable solutions, UNHCR looks to refer refugees for  resettlement to a third country.  

 However, resettlement benefits relatively few refugees. In 2008,  less than one per cent of the world’s refugees were resettled in  third countries. 

 Over the past 10 years, some 807 000 refugees have been  resettled, compared to 11 million refugees who were able to return  to their home country.  

 It is a massive global challenge and one that Australia plays its  part in a humane and comprehensive way. Our approach has three  main elements.  

 The first is to provide assistance and aid to countries of origin to  stabilise situations and assist people who are able to return safely.  

 The second is to support asylum seekers in neighbouring countries  or as close as possible to their country of origin, in order to share  the burden of hosting refugees.  

 The third is to assist in the resettlement of refugees for whom  UNHCR considers that to be the appropriate solution. 

 Australia’s aid contribution to Afghanistan in 2008-09 totalled  nearly $33 million and we have resettled 5200 Afghan refugees  since 2005-06. 

 We have supported a variety of projects to assist Burmese  refugees along the Thai border and assist displaced Burmese  Rohingya in Bangladesh. Since 2005-06 more than 8500  humanitarian visas have been granted to Burmese. 

 In 2008-09 Australia provided $24.5 million in aid for Sri Lankan  civilians to provide food, medical supplies, shelter, water and  sanitation. 

 In Iraq the Australian Government committed $60 million for  humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in 2008-09 and  provided support for displaced Iraqis in countries in Syria and 

 Jordan. Plus, we have resettled about 8600 Iraqis under our  humanitarian program since 2005-06. 

 Our arrangements in Indonesia are in many ways similar to what  we do in Pakistan, along the Thai Burma border, and in places like  Syria and Jordan. We provide support for refugees in a country of  asylum pending a durable solution, while also assisting in the  resettlement of those whom UNHCR determines to be in need. 

 Under our regional cooperation arrangements, Indonesia allows  irregular migrants intercepted en route to Australia to remain in

 Indonesia under the care of the IOM, with any protection claims  referred to the UNHCR for assessment.  

 In 2002 the Director-General of Indonesian Immigration issued a  directive that no asylum-seekers are to be deported and they must  be referred to the UNHCR in Indonesia. Cases found to be owed  protection and determined by the UNHCR to be in need of  resettlement are referred to third countries.  

 Cases referred to Australia are processed in the same way as  cases referred by UNHCR in any other country. Australia is one of  a number of countries, including Canada, USA, New Zealand,  Sweden and France that have been active in resettling refugees  processed in Indonesia.  

 Around 1300 people have been resettled to third countries from  Indonesia since 2001, with Australia taking about a third of those  refugees - more than any other country. 

 The government recently increased its core funding to the UNHCR  by $4.4 million to $14.3 million and provided another $2 million  over two years specifically to support UNHCR's delivery of  protection assessments and outreach activities in Indonesia. 

 The 2009-10 Budget provided the IOM with $5 million over two  years to provide additional accommodation, food and medical care  for intercepted irregular migrants in Indonesia.  

 Some of the commentary on Indonesia has been unfair,  unbalanced and deeply offensive to the Indonesians. Indonesia is  a developing nation - a democracy that is struggling with the  challenge if increasing numbers of refugees. 

 The arrangements with Indonesia are part of Australia’s  comprehensive protection focused response to the global  challenge posed by forced displacement. By way of contrast, the  failed Pacific Solution was not protection focused and stood  outside the global system of international protection.  

 Howard’s Pacific Solution was underpinned by the message that if  you come by boat to Australia you will not received protection here,  even if found to be a refugee. People were quite deliberately left on 

 Nauru even after being found to be owed protection, to ensure that  this message was understood.  

 In the assessment of UNHCR the Pacific Solution was not in  accordance with the object and purpose of the Refugees  Convention, and on that basis it can only be seen to have  undermined, rather than contributed to, the system of international  protection. 

 As well as contributing to the international protection system, our  arrangements in Indonesia help foster a regional approach to the  challenge of irregular movement. The Bali Process - or to use its 

 full name the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in  Persons and Related Transnational Crime - is co-chaired by  Indonesia and Australia. It is a collaborative effort participated in by  over 50 countries and numerous international agencies, including  the UNHCR.  

 Two of the objectives of the Bali Process are the enactment of 

 Page 4 of 8 Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia (FECCA) conference

 national legislation to criminalise people smuggling and trafficking  in persons, and assisting countries to adopt best practices in  asylum management, in accordance with the principles of the  Refugees Convention. This year, the Rudd Government  reinvigorated the Bali Process at ministerial level for the first time  since 2003.  

 There was continued strong recognition at the Bali ministerial  meeting in April that if the issues of people smuggling and irregular  movement are to be effectively addressed, countries in the region  need to work cooperatively rather than in isolation - indeed going it  alone rather than operating under a regional framework was  another reason the Pacific Solution failed.  

 The importance of criminalising people smuggling in the region and  enhancing co-operation on extradition were also again recognised  by ministers at Bali.  

 On the protection side there was also a clear view that origin,  transit and destination countries could all play a part in protecting  refugees.  

 An important outcome of the meeting was the convening of a  working group to address particular irregular movement challenges  in the region. Countries affected by the current surge of irregular  movement by Sri Lankans will be meeting next month in Perth to  discuss the matter.  

 As a committed participant in the system of international  protection, we share responsibility for protecting refugees  worldwide. 

 As Australians, we should feel proud of our long tradition of  supporting those who come to this country, many of whom have  suffered persecution, discrimination and human rights abuses, by  helping them settle effectively and build their new lives in Australia. 

 But we have to recognise that it is a global issue - not one that is  isolated to Australia.  

 Cultural diversity 

 We must remember throughout this debate, that Australia is a  country of migrants - those who have come as refugees and the  many millions who have migrated here to build a new life. 

 Today, some 45 per cent of all Australians were born overseas or  have at least one parent who was born overseas. 

 Immigration has made a crucial contribution to our success as a  nation. 

 It keeps us open to the world, continues to renew us with new  ideas, experiences and wisdom, and harnesses the efforts of  people from around the world in building our nation. 

 One of the great success stories of Australia as a nation is that our  culturally diverse society compares well with other countries in  terms of our low levels of discrimination, social tension or  disharmony.

 That being said, there is always more to be done to ensure that no  groups are left by the wayside in their journey towards full  participation, inclusion and citizenship. 

 This is critically important - for these Australians, for their families,  and for our nation as a whole. 

 Cultural diversity policies are an important means of supporting  everyone to be a full member of our democratic society. 

 No matter where we are from and no matter what our background,  it is important that we all have opportunities to build our capacities,  pursue our aspirations and contribute to the nation. 

 Mutual respect 

 As we grow as a nation, we need a broader vision of the values of  multiculturalism. A vision where all Australians take pride in and  embrace our cultural diversity. 

 We all need respect. We need to give it and receive it from our  fellow community members.  

 This is not conditional on what people look like, where they come  from, what their religion is, what they hope for, or how well they  speak English. 

 Belonging together requires us to look positively beyond our  similarities to our differences. 

 In a country like Australia, blessed by the wealth that is our people,  we must nurture and value it as a national strength. 

 This requires fairness and opportunity. 

 AMAC 

 The Howard Government abandoned the vision of social inclusion  and multiculturalism. 

 To fill this vacuum, we established the Australian Multicultural  Advisory Council (AMAC) last year to bring new cultural diversity  perspectives to the Australian Government. 

 The 16-member council is chaired by AFL chief executive Andrew  Demetriou and includes your very own chair, Voula Messimeri. 

 I have tasked them with focussing on having a conversation with  the Australian community as a whole and not just focus on new  migrants. 

 The Council will play an important role in articulating the benefits of  Australia’s diversity and shaping this government’s response to  religious and cultural intolerance. 

 It will provide invaluable, independent advice to government on  practical approaches to promoting social cohesion, the  engagement of migrants in Australian society, overcoming racism  and intolerance and communicating to the public on this complex

 social policy area. 

 Citizenship 

 Citizenship is an important guiding symbol for everyone living in  Australia - whether newly arrived, descendants of immigrants, or  part of Australia’s Indigenous heritage. 

 Australian citizenship is the bond that unites us all in one common  endeavour across heritage, culture, politics, wealth, religion and  colour. 

 I know many in the audience did not support the introduction of the  Citizenship test by the former government. It was seen as part of  the attack on multiculturalism and a means of excluding new  migrants rather than welcoming their full participation in Australian  society. 

 The Rudd Government supports the citizenship test but not if it  creates a barrier to citizenship. We believe that anyone who has a  will and commitment to learn about Australia and become a citizen  should be given the pathway to do so.  

 The citizenship test is a crucial part of this process and the recent  changes that the government has made to citizenship Test clearly  place the focus on enabling and educating rather than excluding  and alienating. 

 Is it better that a citizen understands what Ludwig Leichhardt or  Don Bradman was famous for or the role of the Australian legal  system in protecting women from domestic violence?  

 The centrepiece of the new citizenship test is the Pledge of  Commitment.  

 The pledge joins all Australians together through a statement of  unity. It is crucial that prospective citizens fully understand the  promise they are making. 

 Democratic beliefs, responsibilities and privileges of Australian  citizenship, and the requirement to uphold and obey the laws of  Australia - aspects all linked to the pledge - should be what  people are tested on. 

 Revised resource book and other changes 

 On 17 September, Citizenship Day this year, I launched a revised  citizenship test resource book, called Australian Citizenship: Our  Common Bond. 

 It implements the recommendations of the citizenship test review  committee. 

 The revised book will assist people to prepare for their citizenship  test and has been written in plain English by educational experts. 

 Additionally, we are also developing a citizenship course to provide  an alternative pathway as a safety net for a small group of people  who are significantly disadvantaged and vulnerable.

 Lastly, there are some people who want to apply for formal  citizenship but it is unreasonable to expect them to sit the  citizenship test. 

 Recent legislative changes will ensure that people who suffer from  a permanent or enduring incapacity will not be required to sit the  citizenship test. 

 This is just one way of ensuring that these people are not  excluded. 

 These changes have been made to ensure that anyone who is  willing to make a commitment to Australia and contribute to the  Australian community is empowered to do so. 

 At this point in our nation’s history, it is important to look to our  future. 

 A future in which will unify the millions of people from diverse  backgrounds who live in this country and will continue to be a  symbol of hope and aspiration for many more who will look to this  country as a place where they too can build a better life. 

 The government’s settlement and cultural diversity programs work  to strengthen Australian society, hand-in-hand with the  government’s human rights and social inclusion agendas. 

 In a world of challenges and opportunities, I believe we should  focus on what it takes for us all to truly belong with our fellow  Australians and share in framing our future together. 

 I look forward to working with you to build on the success that is  modern Australia, founded on the legacy of perhaps the world’s  most successful immigration program. 

 I seek your support for the government’s commitment to pursuing a  strong, fair, multicultural future.
