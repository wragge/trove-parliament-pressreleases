 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration  LABOR’S CAMPAIGN TO GET CHILDREN OUT  FROM BEHIND THE RAZOR WIRE WILL CONTINUE   

 Late last night, the Howard Government defeated Labor’s legislative amendment to get children out  from the behind the razor wire of immigration detention facilities like Woomera.   

 The House of Representatives dealt with the Migration Legislation Amendment (No.1) Bill.     

 Through an amendment to that Bill, Labor sought to modify the legal power to detain asylum seekers  so that the Government would be compelled to:    

 â¢ Put unaccompanied children into foster or community care arrangements.  â¢ Allow families with children to live in accommodation like the Woomera alternate detention  trial.     

 Labor’s amendment was part of its continuing campaign to get children out from behind the razor  wire.  This campaign commenced on Australia Day, when Labor Leader Simon Crean called for the  Government to get the children out.   

 Labor’s campaign and amendment forced a Government back flip on children and detention last week.  A number of Liberal moderates had threatened to cross the floor and vote for Labor’s amendment.  In  response to this pressure, last week Minister Ruddock was forced to announced that his Department 

 would now be bound by guidelines relating to the fostering of unaccompanied children and placing  women and children in accommodation like the Woomera alternate detention trial.   

 Minister Ruddock was forced to make these changes even though he has always maintained any  softening of detention arrangements would be a magnet for people smugglers.   

 While welcome, Minister Ruddock’s changes are not good enough.  His changes do not have the status  of law and can be ignored at any time.  His changes mean that families have to be split with men and  older boys separated from women and children. 

 

 Liberal moderates did not support Labor’s amendment yesterday.  But it will come back before the  House again and when it does Liberal moderates will have to answer the following questions:   

 â¢ Do I believe that getting children out from behind the razor wire is so important that it should  be guaranteed by law?  â¢ Do I believe that families should be kept together and enormous damage is done when  families are forcibly split?    

 All members of the Government will be forced to answer these questions as Labor’s campaign to free  the children continues.           13 December 2002
