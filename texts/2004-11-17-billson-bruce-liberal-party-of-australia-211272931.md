 MEDIA RELEASE 

 The Hon Bruce Billson MP  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs        

 AA 04 076                                                                             Wednesday 17 November 2004 

 

 Rapid Australian response helps Indonesia’s earthquake victims   

 Australia has provided an emergency humanitarian contribution of $50,000 to help  Indonesian earthquake victims, Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr  Bruce Billson, said today.   

 ‘Emergency Australian-funded aid reached victims within hours of Friday’s powerful  earthquake that has killed 25 people, injured more than 230 and destroyed nearly 800  homes,’ Mr Billson said.   

 ‘The first rescue teams from the Indonesian Red Cross delivered much needed assistance  including tarpaulins to shelter 250 families, medicine and a generator.    

 ‘Australian funds are also providing shelter for another 750 families and we stand ready to  offer further assistance if required,’ Mr Billson said.    

 ‘The earthquake, centred on Alor in Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) Province, about 1000 km  east of Bali, measured 7.4 on the Richter scale and was followed by multiple after-shocks.   

 ‘Some 36,000 households have been affected and almost 8,000 structures sustained  moderate to severe damage, including churches, mosques, schools and government  buildings.   

 ‘In addition to Alor, islands in the immediate vicinity reported casualties and extensive  damage, including inundation of coastal areas by tsunami.   

 ‘In nearby Dili, capital of neighbouring East Timor, the earthquake and successive tremors  caused residents to flee their homes, but there have been no reports of casualties or major  damage.’   

 ‘The Australian Government is committed to an effective ongoing aid program in the region  and also providing a rapid disaster response to help communities in need,’ Mr Billson said.    

 In 2004-2005, Australia increased overseas aid funding by nearly 10 per cent to $2.133  billion and augmented by an estimated $14 million to $146 million, our international  humanitarian, emergency and refugee programs.
