 Christmas Island will cope with boat arrivals 

 There are a number of facilities on Christmas Island to accommodate unauthorised  boat arrivals including a secure detention centre and community housing. Children  and, where possible, their families are not held in immigration detention centres. 

 In total, Christmas Island can accommodate up to 1200 people across the range of  facilities. The island's facilities can adequately accommodate the 479 unauthorised  boat arrivals currently on the island and will cope with the latest arrivals. 

 Conflicts in places like Afghanistan and Sri Lanka have seen an increase in the  number of asylum seekers worldwide. 

 A UNHCR report released this month confirms that the increase in people seeking  asylum in Australia is part of a worldwide trend driven by insecurity, persecution and  conflict. 

 The Government allocated $654 million in the May Budget for measures to combat  people smuggling and there have already been some successes in disrupting  ventures in Indonesia.
