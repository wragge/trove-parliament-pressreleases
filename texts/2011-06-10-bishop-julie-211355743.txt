 Foreign Minister Rudd must take greater responsibility 

 Friday, 10 June 2011 

 Minister for Foreign Affairs Kevin Rudd must exert greater control over Australia’s  international relations as the Prime Minister stumbles from crisis to crisis in key areas of  national interest.  

 Mr Rudd has conspicuously avoided involvement in the negotiations with Malaysia with  regard to the proposed five-for-one asylum seeker swap, the negotiations with Papua New  Guinea for the re-opening of the Manus Island detention centre and the live cattle trade crisis  with Indonesia. 

 It is critical that the Foreign Minister play a central role in these issues to prevent longer-term  damage to key relationships and to Australia’s international reputation. 

 Prime Minister Gillard is clearly out of her depth in foreign relations and continues to make  mistakes such as announcing deals to score domestic political points before any agreement  has been finalised. 

 The Prime Minister has learned nothing from her shambolic handling of the now-abandoned  asylum seeker regional processing centre on East Timor. 

 This shows an alarming lack of respect for the governments of sovereign nations. 

 The Foreign Minister should be closely advising the Prime Minister on these issues and  providing guidance to the government to ensure no further damage is wreaked upon our  international relations. 

 The obviously dysfunctional relationship between the Prime Minister and the Foreign  Minister, due to last year’s leadership coup, has ongoing potential to negatively impact on  Australia’s national interest.
