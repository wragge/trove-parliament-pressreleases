 Chris Bowen MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 Negative Coalition prefer boat arrivals  Thursday, 10 May 2012 

 Joint media release with Chris Bowen MP - Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship and Jason Clare MP - Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for  Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel. 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for  Home Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said another asylum seeker boat was intercepted  overnight, the 29th since Tony Abbott rejected the Government's offer to implement  offshore processing. 

 Mr Bowen said as long as Tony Abbott continued to oppose offshore processing,  asylum seeker costs would continue to rise and people's lives would be put at risk at  sea. 

 'The Coalition can't have it both ways. They want to deny the government the ability  to limit boat arrivals and at the same time attack the government for the boats and  their impact on the budget,' Mr Bowen said. 

 'As things stand, without legislation, offshore processing is not possible - whether it's  for Malaysia or Nauru. Scott Morrison's smoke and mirrors cannot change the fact  that the Coalition walked away from deal with the Government to guarantee the  future of offshore processing, including re-establishing a facility on Nauru. 

 'As long as the Coalition continue to put political interest ahead of the national  interest, people have every right to assume they prefer more boats to arrive' 

 Mr Clare said the time had come for Tony Abbott and the Coalition to allow for  offshore processing to proceed. 

 'Working together we can help stop people dying at sea. We can pass legislation to  introduce offshore processing,' Mr Clare said. 

 'If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must stop saying no and pass  our legislation to allow asylum seekers to be processed offshore in Malaysia and  Nauru'
