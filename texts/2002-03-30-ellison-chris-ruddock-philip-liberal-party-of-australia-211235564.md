 Protests at Woomera Detention Centre Joint release with Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Chris Ellison

 MPS 22/2002

 Philip Ruddock, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Senator Chris Ellison, Minister for Justice and Customs, today condemned the protest action of groups at Woomera over the Easter weekend.

 Senator Ellison said that the actions of the protesters had jeopardised the lawful detention of detainees and put at risk the safety of many law enforcement personnel as well as many others present.

 Senator Ellison said protesters were sadly mistaken if they thought their actions would reduce the resolve of the Commonwealth Government to see that the law was upheld at Woomera.

 Senator Ellison confirmed that 6 Australian Federal Police (AFP) officers had gone to Woomera to assist the South Australian Police and Australian Protective Service with investigations.

 "Officers will be looking at a referral of charges relating to those who assisted detainees to escape and for the prosecution of the escapees themselves" Senator Ellison said.

 Mr Ruddock said he found the events very disturbing.

 "There has been significant trespass of Commonwealth property and breaching of fences and this has obviously been the consequence of a premeditated effort," Mr Ruddock said.

 "The protesters have incited inappropriate behaviour both inside and outside the centre and none of these are incidents that can be taken lightly."

 "I find this sort of behaviour inexcusable."

 "It is important that people focus on the detention population. Most do not have active refugee claims and in the main have exhausted all avenues of appeal and so are ready for removal from Australia," Mr Ruddock said.
