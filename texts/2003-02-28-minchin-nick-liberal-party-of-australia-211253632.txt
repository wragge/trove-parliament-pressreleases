 COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT MONTHLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 JANUARY 2003 

 

 KEY POINTS  â¢ The underlying cash balance for the year to date 31 January 2003 was a deficit of $4,986 million. 

 â¢ The fiscal balance for the year to date 31 January 2003 was a deficit of $1,746 million. 

 â¢ The net operating result for the year to date 31 January 2003 was a deficit of $1,559 million. 

 

 FISCAL AND FINANCIAL OUTCOMES  Care needs to be taken when comparing monthly or cumulative data across years, and to full year estimates, since  factors such as the introduction of The New Tax System and the accrual framework, and the timing of payments  and policy decisions can have a large impact on fiscal aggregates from one year to the next and on year to date  outcomes.

 FISCAL OUTCOMES  UNDERLYING CASH BALANCE 

 The  main  components  of  the  underlying  cash  balance  are  cash  from  operations  and  movements  in  the  net   investment in non-financial assets. 

 The underlying cash balance for the year to 31 January 2003 was a deficit of $4,986 million. The underlying cash  balance  as  at  the  end  of  January  2003  is  lower  than  a  pro-rata  of  the  revised  Budget  estimate  (which  equals  a   surplus of $1,249 million).  The main factors contributing to the difference are: 

 â¢ lower  taxation  receipts,  in  line  with  expectations.   Monthly  taxation  receipts  are  variable  and  tend  to  be   higher in the months when quarterly Business Activity Statements are due and lower in other months.  The  quarterly Business Activity Statements for the second quarter of the financial year will be made in February,  therefore this month has lower tax receipts than pro-rata. 

 â¢ higher payments for: 

 â’ Department  of  Education,  Science  and  Training  multiyear  grants,  particularly  for  universities  and   schools. Grant expenses are recognised on a calendar year basis in line with the school year and do not,  therefore,  flow  evenly  throughout  the  year.  Commonwealth  funding  for  schools  and  universities  is   generally paid on a calendar year basis; 

 â’ personal benefits due to:  

 : the  effect  of  seasonal  demand  for  the  Pharmaceutical  Benefits  Scheme  in  the  first  half  of  the   financial year; and 

 : timing of the fortnightly payment of a number of pensions including the Age Pension and the  Disability Support Pension;  

 â’ Defence suppliers, largely brought about by a reduction in creditors; and 

 â’ employees reflecting timing of payments associated with Australian Defence Force postings. 

 These factors were partially offset by: 

 â¢ higher non-taxation receipts from dividends, due largely to the 2001-02 Reserve Bank of Australia dividend,  which is received as one payment in August;  

 â¢ lower grant payments associated with: 

 â’ road infrastructure projects for the National Highway and Roads of National Importance Programme.    Payments for these programmes are made on the achievement of project milestones.  These milestones  are  expected  to  be  reached  later  in  the  second  half  of the financial year.  In addition, expected claims  from the States and Territories under the Natural Disaster and Relief Arrangements Programme are yet  to be submitted;  

 â’ programmes such as primary care strategies; the second round of the Co-ordinated Care Trials; medical  research  grants;  services  in  Aboriginal  and  Torres  Strait  Islander  communities;  the  Workforce   Programme;  Health  Services  for  Rural  Communities;  and  Diagnostic  Imaging  and  Pathology  Reforms   where grants are paid when conditions are met, rather than on a pro-rata basis, but are expected  to be  fully spent by year end; and 

 â’ the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality, due to extended  negotiations with some State and Territories and delays in developing regional plans; 

 â¢ the  intermittent  timing  of  overseas  aid  projects  and  project  payments  throughout  the  year.   A  number  of   annual payments to Pacific countries, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines, have been delayed and will be

 â¢ 

 expensed in early 2003, while a number of payments under international refugee programmes are anticipated  to be expensed in early 2003; and 

 â¢ lower  superannuation  payments  due  to  more  former  Commonwealth  employees  electing  to  receive  their   benefits as a pension rather than a lump sum. 

 Investing  cash  payments  and  receipts  are  lower  than  a  pro-rata  of  the  revised  Budget,  reflecting  uneven  cash   flows throughout the year in relation to the purchase of non-financial assets and proceeds from the sale of non-financial assets. 

 FISCAL BALANCE 

 The fiscal balance for the year to date 31 January 2003 was a deficit of $1,746 million.  The main components of  the  fiscal  balance  are  the  GFS  net  operating  balance,  which  was  a  deficit  of  $1,848  million,  and  a  net  capital   investment of $102 million for the year to date 31 January 2003 (refer to the Reconciliation of AAS31 Operating  Result to Fiscal Balance for further detail). 

 FINANCIAL OUTCOMES 

 OPERATING RESULT 

 The operating result for the year to date 31 January 2003 was a deficit of $1,559 million.  

 REVENUES 

 Total revenues for the year to end January are $99,661 million, comprising $90,236 million in taxation revenue  and $9,425 million in non-tax revenue. 

 The  main  components  in  taxation  revenue  were  Gross  Income  Tax  Withholding  ($47,970  million),  companies   ($19,272 million), excise duty ($12,333 million), and individuals’ refunds (which reduced net revenue by $9,245  million). 

 The  operation  of  The  New  Tax  System  continues  to  have  affects  on  both  the  timing  and  quantity  of  taxation   revenue received by the Commonwealth compared to previous years. 

 EXPENSES  

 Total expenses for the year to end January are $101,220 million, which is comparable to a pro-rata of the revised  Budget  estimate  of  $101,163  million.   Expenses  for  the  year to date are not always directly comparable to full  year  estimates  due  to  seasonal  effects  on  Commonwealth  administered expenses. Many grant programmes, for  instance,  are  recognised  on  a  quarterly  basis  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  grant  agreement  or  upon   completion of project milestones. 

 Factors  contributing  to  differences  between  actual  expenses  and  a  pro-rata  of  the  revised  Budget  estimate   (including their impact by Function) are higher: 

 personal benefits expenses primarily due to higher child care benefits due to seasonal variations such as  an increase in vacation care (Social Security and Welfare function); and 

 grant expenses relating to: 

 â’ the signing of agreements with donor countries on replenishment of the International Development  Association (IDA) and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative which occurred in November  (General Public Services function); and 

 â’ Department  of  Education,  Science  and  Training  multiyear  grants,  particularly  for  universities  and   schools. Grant expenses are recognised on a calendar year basis in line with the school year and do  not,  therefore,  flow  evenly  throughout  the  year.  Commonwealth  funding  for  schools  and   universities is generally expensed on a calendar year basis.  In the majority of cases the expense is  recorded in January (Education and General Public Services function).

 â¢ 

 â¢ 

 These factors were partially offset by lower: 

 other  goods  and  services  expenses  due  to  the  intermittent  timing  of  overseas  aid  projects  and  project   payments throughout the year.  A number of annual payments to Pacific countries, Papua New Guinea  and the Philippines, have been delayed and will be expensed in early 2003, while a number of payments  under  international  refugee  programmes  are  anticipated  to  be  expensed  in  early  2003  (General  Public   Services function); 

 grants expenses in relation to: 

 â’ programmes  such  as  primary  care  strategies;  the  second  round  of  the  Co-ordinated  Care  Trials;   medical  research  grants;  services  in  Aboriginal  and  Torres  Strait  Islander  communities;  the   Workforce  Programme;  Health  Services  for  Rural  Communities;  and  Diagnostic  Imaging  and   Pathology Reforms where grants are paid when conditions are met, rather than on a pro-rata basis,  but are expected  to be fully spent by year end.  This is partly offset by three fortnightly payments  (not the usual two) during January 2003 in grants to the State and Territory governments due to the  Australian Health Care Agreements (Health function); 

 â’ road  infrastructure  projects  for  the  National  Highway  and  Roads  of  National  Importance   Programme,  which  are  recognised  when  approved  projects  commence  and  when  States  meet   funding conditions.  In addition, expected claims from the States and Territories under the Natural  Disaster  and  Relief  Arrangements  Programme  are  yet  to  be  submitted  (Transport  and   Communications and Natural Disaster Relief functions); and 

 â’ the  Natural  Heritage  Trust  and  the  National  Action  Plan  for  Salinity  and  Water  Quality  due  to   protracted  negotiations  with  some  State  and  Territories  and  delays  in  developing  regional  plans.   (Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing and Recreation and Culture functions). 

 personal  benefits  expenses  due  to  demand  for  Family  Tax  Benefit  and  an  increase  in  the  number  of   customers choosing a lump sum payment, and lower customer numbers for Newstart Allowance. (Social  Security and Welfare function). 

 ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 

 The net asset balance within the General Government sector has improved from a negative net asset position of  $48,457  million  at  30  June  2002  as  published  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  to  a  negative  net  asset   position of $44,245 million at 31 January 2003.

 NOTES: 

 With  the  introduction  of  Business  Activity  Statements  and  Instalment  Activity  Statements  last  financial  year,   taxpayers provide information on payments associated with several types of tax when lodging the statement and  paying the aggregate net tax amount. Thus, while total tax collections are known with certainty at the end of each  month, the distribution across the relevant heads of revenue cannot be finalised until all statements are received  and  processed.   The  outcomes  for  some  revenue  items  provided  in  this  statement  are  thus  estimates,  in   accordance with the best judgement of the Taxation Commissioner, and subject to revision. The taxation revenue  items not affected are: Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, Excise duty, Customs duty, Other Taxes and Individuals  Refunds. 

 The sum of the revenue accrued in the month and the revisions to prior periods equals the revenue reported in  the Statement of Revenue and Expenses. 

 All taxation items in these notes are reported on an AAS31 basis.

 NOTE 3: GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 

 In regard to GST revenue, AAS31 and other relevant accounting standards would suggest the gross amount of  GST be included in the Commonwealth’s Financial Statements. However, the clear policy intent of the  Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations is that the GST is a  State tax collected by the Commonwealth in an agency capacity. Therefore, accrued GST revenues and associated  payments to the States and Territories are not disclosed in these statements.
