  JOINT MEDIA RELEASE

  Cairns regional migrant settlement review

  

  MPS 83/98 

  

  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs , Philip 
Ruddock, and Federal Member for Leichhardt, Warren Entsch, today jointly 
announced the establishment of a committee to examine migrant settlement 
needs and the delivery of community-based migrant settlement services 
in the Cairns region. 

  

 Mr Entsch said the eight 
member committee will consider the findings of the report   Settlement Needs and Responses Project Far North Queensland , 
commissioned by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 
and prepared by Cairns-based consultancy Lorraine Brophy and Associates. 

  

 "The key objectives 
of this report were to identify patterns of settlement of refugees and 
migrants and assess their settlement needs on an individual, group and 
community basis." 

  

 "The understanding 
this information will provide will enable the more appropriate and effective 
targeting of migrant settlement services in the Cairns region". 

  

 Mr Ruddock said the 
report was commissioned when the Department terminated core funding 
to the Cairns Migrant Resource Centre from 31 March 1998 because of 
its failure to fulfil responsibilities under a Service Agreement with 
the Department to implement an agreed work program. 

  

 "The report has 
been based on demographic data from the Census and the Department's 
Settlement Database, as well as consultations with representatives of 
community organisations and services in the region. 

  

 "This process is 
aimed at ensuring that funding from my Department is used in the most 
efficient, effective and accountable manner, for the benefit of those 
migrants who access settlement services. There will be no reduction 
in migrant services to people in Cairns." 

  

 The committee comprises 
eight people who have been actively involved in local government, community 
service and ethnic community activities in the Cairns region. They are 
Councillor Deirdre Ford, Ms Lorraine Brophy, Mr Frank Lanza, Ms Aurora 
Foster, Mr Van Yee Chang, Ms Suda Woodward, Mr Tom Vieira, and Mr Theo 
Bacalakis. 

  

 The committee is expected 
to report to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 
within three weeks.
