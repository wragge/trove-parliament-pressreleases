 Funding to Help Migrants under the Community Settlement Services Scheme MPS 127/2001

 Funding initiatives for services to assist migrants, refugees and humanitarian entrants to settle quickly and effectively in Australia, were announced today by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock.

 Mr Ruddock announced that $18.4m will be offered under the Community Settlement Services Scheme (CSSS) to community organisations to provide a range of settlement services in metropolitan, regional and remote areas over three years.

 "The CSSS funding will support a range of settlement services, including referrals to services that help migrants address all their settlement needs, as well as provide vital information on finding a job, housing or education for children, " Mr Ruddock said.

 The Minister explained that settlement services assist refugees, humanitarian entrants and migrants to adjust to life in Australia, to access available mainstream and specialist services and to achieve a level of independence and full participation in Australian society soon after their arrival.

 The initiatives announced today extend and complement the network of settlement services available to refugees, humanitarian entrants and other migrants permanently in Australia.

 Such settlement services include the 132 CSSS grants made to community organisations in 1999 and 2000 for two and three-year projects, as well as core funding provided to 34 Migrant Resource Centres and Migrant Service Agencies.

 The overall funding granted to the settlement services network in 2001 totals $24.6 million.

 The Minister said there has been a high level of interest in the CSSS, with 337 applications for funding being received Australia-wide over a one-month period, with 87 organisations lodging their application on-line.

 "The competition for funding was very strong and from the large number of applications received 187 grants are being funded this year," Mr Ruddock said.

 In total, 56 projects received funding for one year, 81 received funding for two years and 50 received funding for three years.

 Funding Advisory Committees (FACs) in each State and Territory assisted in identifying proposed projects most appropriate for funding by DIMA and to ensure existing services would not be duplicated.
