  BOLKUS WELCOMES OPPOSITION BACKDOWN ON BOAT PEOPLE LEGISLATION 

  The Coalition has seen sense in its belated support for  legislation aimed at protecting the Australian taxpayer from a  potential 'windfall' in compensation payouts to boat people.  The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, senator Nick  Bolkus, today welcomed John Howard's decision to abandon  Coalition opposition to Migration Legislation Amendment Bill No 

  3 1994. 

  "This vindicates the Government's decision to reintroduce the  Bill and pressure the Opposition into taking a responsible  position," Senator Bolkus said.  "Its dramatic backflip on this issue is a major embarrassment for  Opposition Immigration Spokesperson, Senator Jim Short, and his  colleague Phillip Ruddock, who have been well and truly rolled  by their leader. 

  "Both had argued strenuously against the legislation, and were  quite happy last year to put tens of millions of taxpayers'  dollars at risk.  The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill No 3 1994 was introduced  to the House of Representatives last October; rejected by the 

  Senate on November 9 1994 and reintroduced to the House of  Representatives in December. It will be debated in the Senate  in the near future. 

  The legislation proposes amendments to the Migration Act from 1  November 1989 to give sections relating to the legality of  detention the effect that the Parliament originally intended. 

  "The purpose of the Bill is simply to return the law to what the  Parliament, the Department of Immigration and all other parties  thought it to be," Senator Bolkus said. 

  "Curative legislation such as this has precedents in both  Australia and the United states. 

  "I look forward to its speedy passage."
