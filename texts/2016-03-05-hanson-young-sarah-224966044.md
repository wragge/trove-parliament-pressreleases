 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Saturday, 5 March 2016 

 Vicious targeting of gay refugees on Nauru highlights Turnbull’s   urgent need for Exit Strategy  

 Revelations  that  a  gay  refugee  couple  living  in  Nauru  have  been  repeatedly  assaulted  and   targeted due to their sexuality is a further example that the Australian government can no  longer continue to leave people languishing on Nauru and Manus Island. 

 ‘These are two men who have been persecuted in their countries, only to be sent to a living  hell on Nauru,’ the Greens immigration spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young said. 

 ‘While we in Australia prepare to celebrate gay pride at tonight’s Mardi Gras in Sydney,  these men have been condemned by the Australian government to a life of fear and abuse  in Nauru. This is not the first time we’ve heard about refugees being attacked on the basis of  their sexuality in Nauru and Manus Island.’ 

 ‘Nima and Ashkan came to Australia seeking our protection, and instead the Turnbull  government has condemned them to a life in which they feel unsafe even leaving their  home to do the grocery shopping.’ 

 ‘It is unacceptable for the Turnbull government to send people to an island prison in which  their basic rights are violated. It is clear that Malcolm Turnbull needs an Exit Strategy to get  out of this offshore detention mess before more refugees are abused and harmed.’ 

 ‘The Greens want to see a fair an efficient regional system put in place to process people’s  claims for asylum quickly and efficiently and bring them here safely.’  Media Contact: Katie Robertson 0427 604 760
