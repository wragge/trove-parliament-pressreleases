 AUSTRALIAN RICE TO AVERT CAMBODIAN FOOD SHORTAGE

 Australia is sending a further 4,400 tonnes of rice to Cambodia to help meet shortfalls in  local production, the Minister for Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney, said today.

 Australia delivered 5,000 tonnes of rice to Cambodia last month and the further shipment of  4,400 tonnes will leave Geelong on July 31.

 “Demand for rice in Cambodia has soared since the return of 360,000 Cambodian refugees  from Thai border camps,” Mr Bilney said.

 “Although most of the refugees have successfully established adequate food· production, one  third — about 120,000 people — are still at risk of food shortages.

 “Cambodia is entering a danger period as rice stocks are low and harvesting does not start  until August. “

 “Local agricultural production has been hampered by the recent escalation of conflict  between Government and Khmer Rouge forces and the ongoing problem of anti-personnel  mines.

 “Although Australia is helping international efforts to increase local production, supply is  still well short of demand.

 “The Australian rice is being provided to tide over vulnerable groups, including families who  have lost one parent.

 “The rice is intended as an interim measure in support of programs aimed at reducing  dependency and increasing self-sufficiency,” Mr Bilney said.

 The Australian rice is being distributed by the World Food Programme to support returnees  as they re-establish their own food production.

 AIDAB, Australia’s overseas aid agency, is purchasing the rice at market prices from the  Rice Growers Cooperative in the Riverina District of New South Wales.

 Australia is providing about $28.5 million for development programs in Cambodia in  1994-95.
