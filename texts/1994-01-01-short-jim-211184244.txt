 Directional Statement and Portfolio Upgrade Reaffirm

 Coalition Commitment to Immigration and Multicultural Australia

 In his directional statement "The Things That Matter" released today the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Downer, reaffirmed the Coalition's strong commitment to Multicultural Australia, and to a positive and ongoing non-discriminatory immigration policy as an integral part of Australia's nation

 building.

 Mr Downer reinforced this commitment during answers to questions at the National Press Club . lawnch of the Statement.

 The Statement outlines the Coalition's commitment to access and equity in its multicultural and settlement programs.

 We remain committed to giving greater emphasis to English language and literacy services so that new settlers are not disadvantaged by poor understanding of the language.

 The Statement also commits the Coalition to giving a higher priority to the health needs of migrant women and to aged persons than has been accorded them by the Keating Government.

 We are also committed to improving and strengthening community input into Government decision-making on migration and multicultural policies. The Keating Government pays lip service only to consultation.

 The Coalition is determined to redress this unacceptable state of affairs.

 Mr Downer's announcement yesterday that the portfolio of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is to be re-included in the Shadow Cabinet is an extremely positive step. It demonstrates categorically that the Coalition places a very high priority on immigration and multicultural policies and

 on the diverse ethnic communities that have so enriched Australia -economically, socially- and culturally - throughout our history, but especially in recent decades.

 As Labor has tried to centralise

 more and more power in its own hands in Canberra, Australians have come to feel increasingly isolated and powerless.

 As Labor has divided the nation into "gimps" and "categories", Australians as individuals feel ... increasingly neglected and pawns in part of a much bigger political game, and communities feel that

 power has drained away from them to remote bufeaucracies.

 As a consequence, the broad sense of shared community among Australians continues to fracture under the Keating Government.

 The greatest political challenge which Australia faces has nothing to do with rewriting our Constitution.

 It is to stop the erosion of our national community spirit, to once more empower communities and to rebuild our culture of civic

 engagement which is the lifeblood of our democratic society.

 Opportunities And

 Choices For Women

 Expanding opportunities and choices for women throughout the Australian community is a core .

 objective of the Coalition.

 While progress has been made in securing equality of opportunity for women, more needs to be done.

 There must be further genuine

 improvements in vital areas affecting women, including health care, job creation, child care, the tax and family payments system, superannuation, education, savings, violence against women and the

 organisarion of the workplace.

 The cul _ Larof w ard omen in country areas, from non-English speaking backgrounds and -

 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women must be addressed_

 Our National Job Creation Strategy, our National Family Strategy and our program to revitalise communities all have

 speciEc goals and directions, the achievement of which will significantly advance opportunities for women in Australia.

 Diversity of Cultures as

 a_ Community Resource

 Immigration has been fundamental to nation building in Australia and it will continue to be important.

 Australia stands out among the nations of the world for the successful way in which people from every country have been

 brought together in harmony and tolerance of each other.

 Because this has occurred within the recognition of overarching loyalty to Australia's democratic institutions and values, we have been able to

 build a multicultural society which

 has become one of our great national characteristics, and indeed a major national resource.

 The diversity of languages, experiences, and cultural backgrounds possessed by Australians is a part of our national identity which all Australians can share and from

 which they can benefit This diversity can be a great advantage in our relations with almost all other countries in the world.

 It gives Australia special opportunities in building links between the countries of origin of our citizens and the countries of the

 Ksia-Pacific region_ Equally, it is a strong reason why Australia must not turn its back on any region of

 the world.

 We take pride in the role of previous Coalition Governments in laying the basis for the development of our multicultural

 society. The next Coalition Government will be motivated by the same spirit.. We will continue our strong support for

 Australians of all cultural origins and for the building of Australia as a cooperative and tolerant multicultural society based on an

 overriding and unifying commitment to Australia.

 Australia is one of the great

 immigrant nations in modern history. As a result we have a rich heritage of development as a

 multicultural society. Successive waves of migrants from some.200 countries have helped Australia forge a nation that is tolerant,

 harmonious, freedom loving, culturally rich and diverse.

 The Coalition takes great pride-in its role in this achievement, especially during the last 50 years.

 Successive Coalition Governments have facilitated and supported the post-war migration program to

 Australia. It was Coalition Govenarnnts that opened their arms to the victims of repression and suffering, it was the Coalition that

 welcomed the tens of thousands Of refugees from Indochina after 1975.

 The Coalition is also particularly proud of its role in abolishing the White Australia policy.

 We are proud of our record. We will continue our strong support for Australians of all cultural origins and for the building of Australia as

 a co-operative and tolerant multicultural society based on an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia_
