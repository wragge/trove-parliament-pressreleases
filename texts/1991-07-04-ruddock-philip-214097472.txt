 UNDOCUMENTED ARRIVALS AND ON-SHORE REFUGEE CLAIMANTS

 The Minister may be shortly giving consideration to relaxing the provisions which presently limit access  by Cambodian boat people and other undocumented arrivals to consideration under humanitarian as  distinct from refugee provisions.

 There are a number of issues which will obviously be on the Minister's mind. He should however have  regard to the need for consistency in decision making. He should recall the way in which Australia's  interests were sabotaged when particular rules were introduced to assist one group of arrivals over all  others.

 Evidence before the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Migration Regulations yesterday shows that a  mere 2,000 of the 25,000 PRC nationals who arrived in Australia after the Tienanmen Square massacre,  under relaxed pipeline processing arrangements have left Australia.

 Already more then 10,000 on-shore applicantions for refugee status and/or humanitarian consideration  have been lodged. With 13,000 other PRC nationals in Australia, the bulk of whom may now be illegal,  the situation should give rise to very considerable concern.

 This is in addition to the 20,000 PRC nationals granted temporary entry by the Prime Minister because  they were here before the Tienanmen Square massacre.

 If the Minister is now going to change the regulations to enable claims by the Khmer boat people to  be considered on a humanitarian basis, after any rejection of refugee claims, he will need to ensure that  his decision is seen as fair by all other claimants for protection.

 For instance, his explanation will need to distinguish the situations in Cambodia and The Lebanon.

 In Lebanon, the Australian Government has now determined that all illegals should return forthwith  and those previously given protection must leave Australia by November 30 1991.

 This is at the same time as Australia refuses to open its Embassy in Beirut because of the security  situation in Lebanon.

 In Cambodia, the Australian Government announced last week that it was now prepared to recognise  the new administration to be established in Phnom Penh and to re-open an Australian mission there.
