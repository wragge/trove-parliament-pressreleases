 ATTORNEY-GENERAL   THE HON. DARYL WILLIAMS AM QC MP 

 

 TRANSCRIPT 

 Press Conference 

 Law Courts Building, Queen’s Square, Sydney 

 9.15am, 2 May 2003 

 Subject:  New HREOC president………………………………………………………e&oe   

 ATTORNEY: 

 Well good morning ladies and gentleman and thank you for coming out. We are here today  for the announcement of the new President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity  Commission and it gives me enormous pleasure to announce that Justice John William von  Doussa, of the Federal Court of Australia, will be the new President of the Commission,  taking up the office on the 10th of June.  

 Justice von Doussa is a very well known figure in legal circles. He was from 1992 until just  recently, the 30th of April, a part-time Commissioner of the Australian Law Reform  Commission, and from 1986 to 1988 he was a judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia.  He’s been a judge of the Federal Court since 1988. 

 He has held a number of other positions in the legal arena. He has been President of the South  Australian Law Society, he’s been a vice-president of the Law Council of Australia, he’s been  an additional judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, he’s been a  presidential member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and he is President of the  Australian Competition Tribunal. Internationally, he’s also an acting judge on the Supreme  Court of Vanuatu and is a judge of the Supreme Court of Fiji.  

 Justice von Doussa will be succeeding Professor Alice Tay, who has been the President for  some five years. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Professor Tay for her  outstanding contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights in Australia in her  role as President. 

 The appointment of someone so well-known and of such public eminence in the legal sphere  as Justice von Doussa I think bodes very well for the future of the Commission and for the  development of human rights and responsibilities in Australia. 

 I’m personally extremely pleased that Justice von Doussa has agreed to take this appointment  and I look forward to working with him and the other Commissioners. I note the Human  Rights Commissioner, Dr Sev Ozdowski, is here today and the Chief Executive Officer of the  Commission, Ms Diana Temby.  

 Let me now however hand over to Justice von Doussa to say a few words for himself. 

 JUSTICE VON DOUSSA: 

 Mr Attorney, thank you very much. I am honoured that the Government has entrusted me  with the responsibilities of the office of President of the Human Rights and Equal  Opportunity Commission. Until I take up that post, it’s inappropriate that I say anything about  the structure of the Commission or its operation. I confine myself this morning to simply 

  2

 saying that the importance of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and its  objects can not be over-estimated. 

 This Government has repeatedly expressed its commitment to the promotion and protection of  human rights and of course Australia is a party to many international conventions that are  intended to achieve that end. But of course, the mere statement of human rights is a very  hollow exercise unless the community is prepared to acknowledge and recognize those rights  and facilitate the objective, free enjoyment of those rights by all those that possess them. 

 How that’s achieved is an enormous on-going challenge and I really look forward to working  with the members of the Commission and participating and hopefully contributing to the very  excellent and very hard work that they have done in that area.  

 The Attorney has asked that I say a little about myself, perhaps why I thought that I could  undertake the role. I’ve been a lawyer for 40 years now and lawyers are involved in an aspect  of human rights and with dispute resolution. The Federal Court is a specialist court dealing  with administrative decisions. A major role of the President of the Human Rights and Equal  Opportunity Commission is in relation to dealing with complaints and in that respect I think a  judge should have the appropriate training and I’ve always found that type of work interesting  on the occasions that it has come through the court. 

 The Attorney has emphasized, and indeed many others have emphasized, that the real  importance in perhaps getting a community understanding of human rights and therefore a  respect for them is through education. I’ve had a long-standing interest in education. I was  closely involved in designing and administering a law course outside the university structure,  which ran for six years in South Australia in the 1970s, when there was a shortage of places  for lawyers. And more recently I’ve chaired advisory committees both at the University of  South Australia and in the Law Society in respect of continuing education courses. So I have  had some involvement in the education process and I am particularly looking forward to that  aspect of the role. 

 There is an administrative function involved also as the CEO of the Commission. My  experience is perhaps more in the cottage industries level in that I’ve been involved in  running legal professions, I have been involved in the committees of this Court and the  finance and various aspects of administration and I have the experience of serving on the  executives of a Law Society and the Law Council, which was involved in various  administrative functions. 

 My family has an interest in the human rights area. My wife actually is a human rights  lawyer, who worked for many years with the UNHCR, starting off with the refugee camps in  Hong Kong and then in Africa. And she spent four years as a legal officer with the UNHCR  in Geneva. And human rights journals and papers float around our family on a regular basis  around the house, so it’s not an area that’s entirely new to me.  

 I really do look forward to this and I look forward to working with a staff whose reputation is  high and I’m sure the successes of the Commission will continue. Thank you. 

 ATTORNEY: 

 Now we have a little time - I should emphasise little - for questions if there are any.  

 REPORTER: 

 Attorney, Justice von Doussa stands down, or retires, as a judge of the Federal Court to take  up his position. Does that mean he’s not a member of the judiciary and therefore you’ll be  able to direct him what cases HREOC or the Human Rights Commission will be allowed to 

 intervene in at the court level, is that correct? 

 

  3

 ATTORNEY: 

 It’s Justice von Doussa’s intention, which he can confirm, to retire from the Federal Court on  appointment. Under the Bill, and I assume that’s what you’re referring to, where a person is,  immediately prior to appointment, a judge of the Federal Court, the approval of the Attorney-General is not required for an intervention. 

 REPORTER: 

 But it is his choice to step down? 

 JUSTICE VON DOUSSA: 

 Yes, it is my choice for a number of reasons. One, I think because of the intervention power it  would look better if the intervener was not at the same time in charge of..sorry, the person in  charge of the intervener was not a judge and seeking to have the cause decided by colleagues 

 as it were. 

 I think it’s also appropriate to resign because of the complaints function. A dissatisfied  complainant, who will receive a letter from the President with a decision, has the right either  to go to the Magistrates Court or to the Federal Court and I think there is scope for  embarrassment for the judicial officer who might then be asked to overview the decision and,  understandably at times, a feeling on the part of the complainant that they are appealing from  Caesar to Caeser. 

 I think there’s also a perception issue. I anticipate Mr Attorney that, from time to time, the  President might clash with the Government over certain issues. And I think if people are  going to involve themselves as advocates for a public cause, they oughtn’t  to do so under the  umbrella of a judge.  

 REPORTER: 

 In that case do you think you’ll be able to work with this new legislation and the changes to  the workings of the Commission? 

 JUSTICE VON DOUSSA: 

 I don’t wish to become involved in a discussion at the moment about the structure of the  Commission. There is at the moment a President of the Commission whose function it is to  express whatever views she and the Commission think appropriate. 

 REPORTER: 

 So you would be happy to work with whatever form the Commission takes in future? 

 JUSTICE VON DOUSSA: 

 It is the role of the President to work within the parameters of the Act and I shall endeavour to  do so. 

 REPORTER: 

 Mr Williams, I believe that clause relating to judges and whether or not that seek approval  from you is one of the only changes in this proposed legislation from last time it was put to  Parliament. Why was it included? 

 ATTORNEY: 

 Well I think His Honour has just given a number of reasons why it’s appropriate.  

 REPORTER: 

 But with all due respect to His Honour, he wasn’t the one drafting the legislation. 

  4

 ATTORNEY: 

 But those drafting the legislation take account of the same sort of considerations. I think there  is also perhaps, not only the perception or a Constitutional issue which might arise in relation  to a sitting Federal Court judge, but there is also the fact that an experienced judge is 

 accustomed to making the sort of decisions that are involved in the community interest in  determining whether there should be an intervention. And I feel quite comfortable with that. 

 REPORTER: 

 Mr Williams, it’s been widely reported that Justice von Doussa was your choice to go to the  High Court to replace Justice Toohey in 1998. But some people suggested you were, quote-unquote, “rolled in Cabinet” and Ian Callinan was appointed. Was there any difficulty in 

 Cabinet, convincing them that Justice von Doussa should take up this appointment? 

 ATTORNEY: 

 I have a longstanding practice of not commenting on anything that might be said in Cabinet.  But I can assure you that Justice von Doussa’s appointment is warmly welcomed by the  Government and across the Government. 

 REPORTER: 

 Justice von Doussa, what do you think are the major challenges facing Australia at the  moment in regard to human rights and equal opportunity? 

 JUSTICE VON DOUSSA: 

 I think the major challenge is within Australia in getting people to understand what the human  rights, what the notion of human rights obliges them to recognize. I have a feeling that, often,  people assert human rights in a way that frightens off those who really have the responsibility  of recognizing them and I have confidence that, given time and appropriate educative  programs of the kind that are already being run by the Commission, the culture of the society  and attitudes can be changed to the point where people realize that the assertion of human  rights is not an attempt to take something away from those that have. It is an occasion to  extend to those that haven’t, something that they would like and from which the community  would benefit. 

 REPORTER: 

 Do you think sometimes, there’s so much focus on human rights with the war on Iraq, that a  lot of Australians think that human rights abuses is something that happens overseas and it  doesn’t occur in Australia? 

 JUSTICE VON DOUSSA: 

 Well I’m quite sure they think the real excesses are occurring overseas. Perhaps part of the  educative program is to make people look a little bit closer at what’s happening at home.
