 Senator Andrew Bartlett   Leader of the Australian Democrats  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Spokesperson  2 September 2003                  MEDIA RELEASE                                  03/634               

 

 Refugee release just a start   

 The Australian Democrats have welcomed the release of 21 refugees from detention centres on  Nauru who will arrive in Australia this afternoon.   

 Democrats’ Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said the release of the refugees, including some who  arrived aboard the Tampa, is a breakthrough after many waited more than 18 months for a country  to accept them.   

 “While I welcome their release we cannot forget there are hundreds of innocent asylum seekers still  locked up on Nauru,” said Senator Bartlett.   

 “This includes more than 190 families who have been locked in the harshest conditions and subject  to incredible suffering.   

 “Their treatment has also been an unnecessary cost of millions of dollars to Australian taxpayers.”   

 Senator Bartlett, who recently returned from a trip to the Nauru detention centres, said women and  children, whose husbands have been granted refugee status in Australia, are still being kept in  detention.   

 “Any policy that keeps families apart and children locked behind razor wire can only be described  as heartless and cruel,” he said.   

 “The arrival in Australia of these 21 refugees is a positive step but keeping other asylum seekers  who have committed no crime out of mind and out of sight in detention camps on Nauru remains an  unspeakably callous act by this Government.   

 “This Government and their so-called ‘Pacific Solution’ neglects the fact that asylum seekers are  real people with real families,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
