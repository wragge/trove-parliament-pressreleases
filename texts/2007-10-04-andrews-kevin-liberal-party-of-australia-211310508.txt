 Kevin Andrews MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 Australia's Refugee and Humanitarian Programme 

 Thursday, 4 October 2007 

 Doorstop: CPO, Melbourne  

 E&OE… 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Ladies and gentlemen, I’m here to make some comments because of some of  the reports in the last 24 hours contain misinformation about how the Refugee  and Humanitarian Programme policy is determined. There are three things  which the Government takes into account in determining the programme and  these three things are equally important. The first is that we seek to assist  those in greatest need, in doing that we consult widely and part of that  consultation, an important part of that consultation, is with the United Nations  High Commission for Refugees. And part of the change, for example, to  reflect the needs of people that have fled from Iraq is a reflection of our  consultation with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. 

 The second thing we take into account is how successfully current migrants  are settling in Australia. And that involves us looking at the services which are  being provided and to look and see whether there are changed needs, from  time to time, of the migrant groups that we’re dealing with. And the reality is  that there have been changed needs and as a result of that in this year’s  Budget we put significant additional funds into providing enhanced services  for people coming here.  

 The third element is that community confidence in the programme is essential.  And there are concerns in the community about aspects of the programme.  For example, I was listening to the radio this morning, Councillor Peter Brown,  the Deputy Mayor, I think is his position, of the City of Greater Dandenong,  who also happens to be a school teacher in the area, was expressing  concerns on behalf of the community in that area about the programme at the  present time. I also receive regular reports through my Department, reports  which are provided from, compiled from a variety of sources including  community organisations in some instances and the Police in some instances.  And in the statement which I’m releasing at the end of this media conference  there is a summary of that material which has been provided to me over the  course of this year, and that will be available to you.  

 So these three things, assisting the people in the greatest need, looking at  how current migrants and current, or recent refugee and humanitarian  entrants to Australia are settling, and community confidence in the  programme are equally important elements to the programme. The reality is  that if we’ve got a problem then we need to name that problem, we secondly  need to resource the problem, which is what we’re doing, and we should not  exacerbate the problem which is part of the reason why we’re reducing the  numbers so we can actually meet the challenges that we have. 

 QUESTION: 

 Minister Andrews, if the Police Commissioner Christine Nixon says that  Sudanese, for example, account for one per cent of the people coming before  them. What is the hard evidence that you’ve got to show Sudanese, and other  African, immigrants or refugees that most of them aren’t settling in to  Melbourne and Australia? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Well can I give you a summary of material, which you’ll get in the statement: 

 â¢ Concerns about the establishment of race based gangs.   â¢ Reports of altercations between African groups in nightclubs and at  community functions.   â¢ Disagreements amongst prominent African community organisations 

 over accusations that some are receiving favoured treatment in  accessing community services   â¢ Tensions have arisen between some African families, involving conflict  and assault.   â¢ Concern among some community leaders as to the increase in crime 

 among African youth.   â¢ Reports of a developing trend of young African males congregating in  parks at night, often to consume alcohol.  

 So, this is a summary of the material which has been provided tome. I’m not  the only one saying there’s a problem. If you look in the newspaper this  morning, Mr Hall the CEO, I think he is, of Mission Australia says ‘these  groups face a unique set of challenges in this country.’  I mean the Secretary  of the Police Association, Mr Mullet, as I recall, made similar claims earlier  this year. I think the fact that there’s a problem there is not something which is  really in dispute. 

 QUESTION: 

 You mentioned the support services, the Chair of the Sudanese Lost Boys  Association says they’re getting very little help to integrate into the  community, they’ve had some support from the State Government but hardly  any from the Federal Government, so can you elaborate on the services, what  are you actually doing to help young Sudanese men, in particular, understand  what their responsibilities are in Melbourne? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Well we spend about 300, I think it’s $300 million a year currently, somewhere  between $250-300 million a year currently. We’re putting another $210 million  over the next four years into the settlement programmes, specifically,  specifically as a response to this issue. Specifically to, the reality is that we  are dealing with a different group of people. For example, the average  schooling age, if you compare those who came to Australia in 2005-06 to just  2002-03: 

 â¢ average schooling was 4.3 years compared to 7 years in 2002-03;   â¢ 40% had spent time in a refugee camp compared to 15% in 2002-03;   â¢ 11% rated their reading ability as good or very good, compared to 27%  in 2002-03;  

 â¢ 80% required an interpreter compared to 64% in 2002-03; and   â¢ 67% were aged under 25 compared to 58% just 3 years previous to  that.  

 So there is quite a change, changed nature of the group of entrants that have  come particularly over the last couple of years. 

 QUESTION: 

 Minister, I’m from the AM programme at the ABC and I interviewed four  Sudanese refugees last night. All in their early 20’s, three of them had spent  three years in a refugee camp in Kenya where they obtained year 8 level,  they’re not all studying at Footscray TAFE, Victoria University, and doing well.  (Inaudible) English and they’re very disturbed that their reputation’s being  tarnished by some isolated crimes. Now what do you say to those young men  who, most of whom are totally without family, their parents have been killed in  the war and they’re doing their best to make a life here. But they’re saying  they’re not getting enough support, they have, they are doing well  educationally, not all of them in the community, surely, is illiterate. 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 No, and I’m not saying they are. What I’m saying is if you take the overall  picture, this is a group of people that are presenting many more unique  challenges than we’ve had in the past. I’m not the only one saying it I’m  reporting what a wide variety of sources are saying. Let me, let me quote from  what Councillor Brown said on radio this morning when he was asked about  this and he is a man who says he’s in his 60’s, I think, and a school teacher in  the area as well, he says: 

 “The problem has certainly escalated in the last 12 months…I’m a school  teacher as a matter of fact and one of the most challenging groups of students  we’ve had to deal with has been the Sudanese…Particularly the young boys  and the young men, or the young males. They’ve come from an environment  where there’s been very little domestic control. I’m almost 60, this has been  the most difficult group to integrate into Australian culture.” 

 No, I think it’s a great tribute to the people that you referred to that they’ve  been able to overcome problems. We want every person to be able to  overcome those problems. And what our response is to say right, let’s put  more money and more funds and more effort and more services in place.  That’s obviously part of the problem. Let’s name the problem, let’s resource  the problem but let’s also no exacerbate the problem until we’ve overcome the  challenges we’ve got. 

 QUESTION: 

 The Greens candidate Adam Brandt, he’s the Greens candidate for the seat  of Melbourne, (inaudible) yesterday that what was needed was actually more  immigration to bring in more family members of these young men so that they  can help them integrate. How would you respond to that (inaudible)? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 What one of the challenges we’ve been facing in terms of the Humanitarian  Programme is where people who are struggling in cases to settle and  integrate themselves a have effectively been sponsoring others to come here  and therefore adding to the problem. And from the beginning of next year, we  announced this some months ago, from the beginning of next year we’re  changing the sponsorship arrangements for the Humanitarian Programme so  that community groups and community organisations are the sponsors rather  than the individuals. Because it doesn’t make much sense, as I say, to  recognise a problem that is widely recognised, but to exacerbate that  problem. So I would disagree with him, I think the opposite is actually the way  in which we need to actually tackle the issue. 

 QUESTION: 

 (Inaudible) 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 No, I think it’s a reflection of the nature of the group of people we’re dealing  with. Whether it’s what Councillor Brown said, or what Mr Mullet said, the  reality is we’ve got to have community confidence in this programme. Surely  you’ve got to assist those in need, that’s one of the elements of it, secondly  we’ve got to look at settlement, but thirdly we have to ensure that the  Australian community remains supportive of and confident of this programme.  You’ve got to have all of those three things together if we’re going to take the  immigration programme forward. 

 Immigration’s vitally important to Australia. Australia will have difficulty thriving  the way it has in the future if we don’t have a good immigration programme,  but that’s got to have community confidence to go forward. 

 QUESTION: 

 The documents you’re releasing today are summaries of information you’ve  received? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Yes, we’re going to provide a statement which has got a summary and I’ve  read some of it to you. 

 QUESTION: 

 Will you release the full documents? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Well this is, this is information which is compiled from a variety of sources. A  lot of this information comes from groups like community organisations, it  comes from Police, it comes from a variety of sources and obviously those  people are not going to provide information to us the way they do if we  disclose the sources of information. But I’ll give you a summary of it, you can  see the range of material. But as I say, I’m not the only one saying this, you  know, when you have Mr Hall this morning in the, in The Age newspaper,  saying that this is a group with unique challenges and problems, and you’ve  got others saying the same thing. But let’s not have, you know, some  continued almost arcane debate about whether there’s a problem. The reality  is that anybody who’s dealt with the issue knows there’s a problem and a  challenge. The question now is what do we do to resolve it. 

 QUESTION: 

 (Inaudible) charged issue as you’re reporting wouldn’t it make sense to put as  much information out there as possible to give the public their ability to make  that judgement? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Well I am putting information out and people make their judgement on the  basis of the information that they, they obtain. But you know there’s been a lot  of reporting of this is not as if there’s an absence of information available. 

 QUESTION: 

 Minister Andrews, what’s changed since the time of your predecessor Mr  Ruddock who talked about Africans in a sense missing out on humanitarian  programmes to now where you’re now talking about the needs of Iraqi’s and  others? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Well, as I said, we’re looking at those who’ve got the greatest need as one of  the elements of the way in which we make a decision. Now, in April this year 

 the United Nations High Commission for Refugees convened an international  conference in Geneva to look specifically at the plight of people who had fled  from Iraq. There’s an estimated 3-4 million people who have fled Iraq who are  in Syria and Jordan and surrounding countries. Now they’ve got needs as  well. We know there are people that have fled Burma who have been in  refugee camps on the Thai border for years and years and years. And we  know that there’s an exacerbation of that situation in Burma at the present  time, they’ve got real needs as well. 

 There are 20 million, estimated, 20 million refugees in the world. We in  Australia take 13,000, in absolute numbers that’s the second highest intake of  refugees of any country in the world. The only country that takes more  refugees under a formal refugee programme is the United States of America,  we’re second, Canada’s third. Of the roughly seven other countries outside  Canada, the United States and Australia, they take a handful of people. I think  all of Europe takes less than probably half of what we take in Australia. We’re  talking about 10 countries in the world who take refugees, we are very  generous in that regard, on a per capita basis we are the most generous  country in the world but there are 20 million refugees and we try and look at  where the greatest need is and that’s in various places around the world. 

 QUESTION: 

 Do you acknowledge the need of African refugees looking to come to the  country? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Certainly and that’s why we’re continuing to bring 30 per cent in this year. But  I also acknowledge the needs of people from Iraq, and I acknowledge the  needs of people from Burma and other places around the world as well.  They’re not the only three groups that we bring but they’re substantially the  largest groups that will come this year. But there are people from other places  that we bring into Australia as well. But, as I said, that’s one factor. The  second factor is settlement, what’s happening in terms of them getting here,  migration doesn’t stop when a person gets off a plane at Tullamarine Airport  or elsewhere around Australia. It’s an ongoing process and if they want to  achieve their aspirations, which we want them, then obviously we’ve got to  look at settlement services and the rate at which people are actually settling in  Australia. And thirdly, as I said, we’ve got to retain community confidence in  this programme. Immigration is vitally important for Australia, we want the  Australian people to support it. 

 QUESTION: 

 Isn’t this just the new Tampa or the new interest rates scare in the lead up to  the election? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 It’s about dealing with the practical issue, as I said. Lots of people  acknowledge the problem and they’re a range of people. Some of them don’t  agree with our solution but they acknowledge there’s a problem out there.  Now there’s a problem out there, my experience is the best thing to do to start  with dealing with the problems is actually to name it and to acknowledge it. If  you don’t do that then you’re unlikely to actually deal with the problem. 

 QUESTION: 

 Mr Andrews, what makes you think that Iraqi and Burmese refugees will  perhaps settle better into Australia than the African refugees? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Well we will obviously monitor their rate of settlement in Australia as we are  with other groups. But so far the evidence that I have, in relation to those who  have come from those locations, and that’s showing the same challenges that  we’ve got. Now, we continue to monitor this and that’s why you have to have  a programme which can be adjusted from year to year. Because a whole  variety of circumstances can change from year to year. Circumstances can  change in terms of where the refugee and humanitarian need is so far as  different locations around the world. But secondly changes can occur in  Australia as to the rate of integration and settlement here. And we need to be  flexible from year to year. 

 QUESTION: 

 Do you think if you invest more money in helping the African refugees settle  into Australia and some of these problems that you’re suggesting are sorted  out that you will revise the intake? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:   

 Certainly, I mean, we, we, as I said, I’m not saying we’re going to put it up or  down because it’s hypothetical but in broad terms my answer is that when we  come to look at it next year and then the year after and the year after, you  look at these factors. You look at where’s the need in terms of bringing people  from; how the people that have already arrived here settling into Australia;  and how is the community attitude towards this,  has the community got  concerns, does the community think this is working well. Now those are the  factors we line up. 

 Thanks very much.
