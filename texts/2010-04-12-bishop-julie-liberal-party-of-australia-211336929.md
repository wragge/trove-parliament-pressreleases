 Rudd Government desperation on border protection

 Monday, 12 April 2010

 The Rudd Government's desperation has been exposed as it attempts to paper over the cracks in its failed border protection policies, Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop said today.

 Ms Bishop said Rudd Government Ministers, including Foreign Minister Stephen Smith, continue to misrepresent the relationship between Rudd Government decisions and the processes of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

 "Foreign Minister Smith repeated the misleading claim yesterday that the Rudd Government was acting in concert with the UNHCR, in its decision to suspend processing of asylum claims from Sri Lanka and Afghanistan," Ms Bishop said.

 "The Government continues to make this claim despite the UNHCR clearly stating it was not a party to the decision."

 UNHCR Regional Representative Mr Richard Towle has said, "The decision by Australia to suspend the processing of Afghan and Sri Lankan asylum-seekers was made independently from UNHCR and was a decision taken solely by the Australian government." and that "We are in the process of reviewing our guidelines in relation to Sri Lanka as we are in relation to many other countries. But there's nothing remarkable about that."

 Ms Bishop said Rudd Government Ministers have given numerous interviews in recent weeks but none have accepted responsibility for weakening Australia's border protection laws and putting people smugglers back in business.

 "Mr Rudd's decision in August 2008 to weaken the laws protecting Australia's borders has resulted in a massive increase in people smuggling," she said.

 "The decision to suspend processing of asylum seekers from Afghanistan and Sri Lanka is a stunt to get the Government past the election with its failed border protection laws in place.

 "It is time for the Rudd Government to take responsibility for its own failures and halt the dishonesty with regard to the UNHCR."
