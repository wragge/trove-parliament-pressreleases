 Gillard, Abbott edge towards unholy alliance to scuttle global law  

  The Gillard Government and Abbott Opposition are edging towards an unholy  alliance aimed at agreeing on legislation for offshore processing of refugees in  breach of international law, Greens Leader Bob Brown said today.  

 “The High Court’s decision was based on the global refugee convention but now  there’s an emerging big party consensus to circumvent it. The Greens will not,”  Senator Brown said in Hobart. 

 “Our policy for onshore processing is legal, humane and saves billions of dollars -  and it is backed by public opinion,” Senator Brown said.
