 FROM THE AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR HEALTH  THE HON. NEAL BLEWETT

 VICTORIAN RESEARCHERS RECEIVE HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH FUNDS TO 

 EVALUATE ADJUSTMENT OF RECENTLY-ARRIVED INDO-CHINESE REFUGEES

 The Minister for Health, Dr Neal Blewett, announced today 

 a $47 323 grant for the final year of a research study of the 

 social and psychological adjustment of recently-arrived Indo­

 Chinese refugee groups.

 The study was being conducted by Dr J .  Krupinski,  of the 

 Victorian Mental Health Research Institute,  and Professor G. 

 Burrows, of the Austin Hospital.

 This three-year project was approved in June 1981 at an 

 estimated total cost of $ 152 500 and a progress report of the 

 study has been made.

 Dr Blewett said that the health of recently-arrived 

 migrant groups was an important area of research and it was 

 expected that the final report on the subject would be available 

 during 1984.

 The grant is among grants totalling $408 952 which have 

 been awarded to researchers in three States and the Australian 

 Capital Territory.
