 Community is right to have reservations about   returns to Iran   

 Recent reports of failed asylum seekers currently being repatriated to Iran is a matter of  concern to many Australians, with reports querying their safety and security on return.   

 Labor clearly accepts that in order for any immigration system to have integrity, there  must be provisions for failed asylum seekers to be sent home.   M

 E D I A  R E L E A S E  

 

 However, Labor insists that Australia must meet its obligations to ensure that people  are not being sent back to dangerous situations, where they face violence, torture,  persecution or other human rights abuses.   

 While Minister Ruddock continues to keep secret an agreement made with the Iranian  Government, it is impossible to have confidence that appropriate arrangements have  been made for the returnees’ safety.     

 The Minister explicitly denies any responsibility for the safety of the people he is  returning.   

 Labor has made clear in its asylum seeker policy that, in contrast to the Government’s  approach, we:   

 â¢ Will implement a system of monitoring returnees in country of return, by  working in cooperation with relevant international agencies such as the United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR); 

 â¢ Will develop a practical and consistent international framework to specifically  address the issue of gender persecution for asylum seekers; and  â¢ Do not support long-term detention of asylum seekers - (fast, fair, processing  would see 90% of asylum seekers processed in 90 days) which would result in 

 such returns happening quickly, not after people have spent several years in  detention.    

 The Government needs to provide more information, and assure the community it is  not sending people back to dangerous circumstances.
