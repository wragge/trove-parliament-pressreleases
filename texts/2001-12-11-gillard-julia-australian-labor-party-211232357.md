 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 CHRISTMAS ISLAND TYPHOID OUTBREAK MEANS INDEPENDENT DOCTORS ARE NEEDED NOW.

 Every day brings a new and worrying revelation about health problems amongst detained asylum seekers.

 Today, we learn that an asylum seeker detained with 180 others in a sports hall at Christmas Island has typhoid.

 Yesterday, the fact that a significant number of the asylum seekers at the Villawood Detention Centre studied were suffering from a very serious depressive condition associated with suicide and self-mutilation attempts was revealed.

 It’s time the Immigration Minister, Philip Ruddock, stopped playing politics with the health of asylum seekers.  Every time a health concern is raised the Minister simply denies there is a problem.

 The community isn’t interested in claim and counter claim about these critical health issues.  The community wants to know the truth.

 Yesterday, Labor called for independent doctors to care for the health needs of detained asylum seekers.  This is the obvious solution.  These doctors would be free to tell the community the truth about what is happening.

 We don’t have independent information now because the company that runs detention centres, Australasian Corrections Management, pays the doctors involved. These doctors are not free to tell the community what is happening because they are worried about losing their jobs or breaching ACM confidentiality agreements.

 The Minister should act now and direct that the monies earmarked by ACM for health services be used to pay for the services of independent doctors.  If the Minister has nothing to hide he has nothing to fear.
