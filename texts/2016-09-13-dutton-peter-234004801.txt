 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 AUDITOR EXPOSES LABOR DYSFUNCTION IN GOVERNMENT 

 The ANAO Report into Regional Processing Centres released today is an independent  exposÃ© of the absolute chaos and dysfunction at the heart of the Rudd-Gillard Labor  Governments in their handling of border security.   

 Total responsibility for the problems and processes outlined in the report falls upon  Labor.   

 The Auditor’s report is critical of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection  (DIBP) during the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years and the process of re-establishing the  Regional Processing Centres. It has made recommendations for improvement which the  Department has agreed.   

 The Coalition is working steadfastly to clean up Labor’s monumental mess.   

 However Labor must acknowledge that its incompetent performance placed an  impossible burden on the public service which was charged with re-opening Regional  Processing Centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea within a matter of weeks.   

 The hardworking men and women of the Department and Australian Border Force have  been sleighted in this process and at various times by Labor MPs and this report  demonstrates Bill Shorten owes the DIBP staff an apology.   

 Labor’s failures are laid bare as it attempted to deal with the consequences of its  absolute failure to maintain the integrity and security of Australia’s borders.   

 In the months before Labor made the 2012 decision to reinstate regional processing  6953 Illegal Maritime Arrivals (IMAs) landed in Australia - more than the total number  that arrived in 2011 - onshore detention centres were full to overflowing with 7000 other  IMAs.   

 As the numbers of people smuggler boats rose, the numbers of IMAs soared and the  deaths at sea became undeniable - there was clear desperation within the then Labor  Government to find ways to halt the people trafficking trade.   

 To this day Labor remains riven with dissent on border security and is destined to  repeat its mistakes if ever returned to government.

 The Coalition remains committed to its strong and consistent border protection policies,  of boat turnbacks, regional processing and Temporary Protection Visas.   

 The Coalition has stopped the boats, ended deaths at sea, removed children from  detention, closed 17 detention centres and returned integrity to Australia’s refugee and  humanitarian programmes.
