 BUDGET PUTS PRESSURE ON AUSTRALIA'S  BORDERS  Senator the Hon Christopher Ellison   Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate 

 The Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris  Ellison today said funding cuts in border protection immigration processing functions could have  repercussions for immigration control. 

 Prime Minister Rudd himself said last night on the 7:30 Report that ‘a lot is being asked’ of the  Department of Immigration and Citizenship to deliver the increased skilled migration intake yet he  is making significant cuts to areas that will be required to deliver this increase. 

 ‘Efficiency’ measures of the Rudd Budget will rip $67.4 million out of critical border security and  immigration processing functions and in the next 12 months at least 221 immigration officers will  be removed from key roles. 

 Senator Ellison said strong immigration control contributes to border security and strengthens  international cooperative efforts against people smuggling, human trafficking and terrorism. 

 Cuts totalling $43.6 million will be made to border security, economic and family migration, visitor  and working holiday services, student visa and temporary resident services as well as refugee  and humanitarian programmes. 

 ‘It is essential to ensure that all persons travelling to Australia have their visa thoroughly and  efficiently assessed, administrative functions properly resourced and the staff who this vitally  important work are well supported. Cuts of this size to such a critical area of national security are  concerning,’ said Senator Ellison.   Cuts totalling $23.8 million will be made to overseas immigration services.  

 ‘Our overseas posts are the frontline in our border protection against those who should be  prevented from entering our country as well as the frontline in promotion of Australia to those who  wish to visit or work in Australia,’ said Senator Ellison.
