 PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT

 BY THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS & TRADE 

 MR BILL HAYDEN, M.P.  .

 17 MARCH 1988

 PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT

 Madam Speaker, during my recent visit overseas I represented   the Australian Government in valuable and productive   discussions with heads and members of governments and other   community leaders iri Mauritius, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique,   Kenya, Yemen Arab Republic, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Israel,   Maldives, Singapore and Indonesia.

 These discussions canvassed a broad range of topics, including   international and regional issues, economic and trade matters   and official aid activities.

 There were two particular points of significance about my   visit.

 The first is that the issues raised range across all our   national interests and obligations: the Commonwealth and the Front Line States, for example; trade and aid; the Middle East   dispute; the Gulf War and the arms race; human rights; and our  

 immediate regional preoccupations.

 In Lusaka, Iâ attended the first meeting of the Commonwealth   Foreign Ministers' Committee which was set up by the Vancouver   Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in order to bring   about Commonwealth action to hasten the end of apartheid.

 The Lusaka meeting decided on a program of work to achieve two   objectives.

 One was to widen and tighten Commonwealth sanctions against   South Africa.

 Australia made an important contribution to this objective by   presenting a report on work done by Australia towards the study   (commissioned by the CHOGM) into South Africa's relationship   with the international financial system.

 This study will provide better understanding of possibilities   for financial sanctions against the apartheid regime.

 Australia will continue to contribute to this study, which will   be considered at a future meeting of the Commonwealth Foreign   Ministers.

 The Lusaka meeting was not concerned solely with sanctions, of   coursei

 2.

 Its second objective was to find ways in which the Commonwealth   can play a constructive role in a range of a activities:   reducing the economic dependence of Front Line States on South   Africa; assisting with their security needs; facilitating   contact with groups inside and outside South Africa;  supporting   victims and opponents of apartheid; and counteracting South   African propaganda and censorship.

 The Front Line States opposing the apartheid regime bear a   heavy burden, in the sense that their economic condition is in   large measure determined by this regime.

 This was a recurring theme in my discussions with leaders of   Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.

 We make no bones about our concern for these economies.

 Apartheid is the most deplorable example possible of   infringment of fundamental human rights.

 Unlike the Opposition, the Government will not tolerate   compromise over this great moral imperative.

 The Commonwealth has focussed attention on the plight of   Mozambique, a special victim of drought and famine complicated   by campaigns of destabilisation by Pretoria.

 The drought is particularly serious and international awareness   of'its effects is spreading at last. .

 Senior officials of the Ihternational Committee for the Red   Cross.and of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for   Refugees describe the refugee situation in Mozambique as the   worst they have ever encountered.

 The Commonwealth and the wider international community have   therefore sought to respond out of humanitarian concern for the   predicament in which the ordinary people of Mozambique find   themselves.

 Australia’s capacity to help is obviously limited.

 3 .

 Our pledge of $100 million in aid over three years to the   "  countries of Southern Africa (including Mozambique) is small compared to the commitments of Canada (for example) and the   * Europeans.

 It is nevertheless an earnest of our commitment to a nation   bordering on the Indian Ocean, which is a region of   significance to Australia.

 It allows us, moreover, to continue our close involvement in an   international issue of fundamental concern and to assist   Mozambique to cope with the consequences of South African   destabilisation.

 The Opposition's attitude on this point is churlish and   shameful.

 Let me make two points about this meanness.

 One is that —  for all the Opposition's indignation about aid J

 to Southern Africa —  the fact is that this level of aid will :

 increase by a few cents to about 32 cents on average per head this year! Compare this to more than $95 per head spent last year in PNG (for example) or more than $100 per head in Vanuatu!

 The second point is that most of it is in the form of food aid   and at least three quarters of our food aid over the past four   years has been spent on Australian produce.

 If the Hon Member for North Sydney, having heard this, still   disagrees with the idea of giving humanitarian aid to the   starving and the famished of Southern Africa, let him go and   explain himself to the high-protein biscuit producers in NSW or   the sorghum farmers in Queensland or the dried fruit growers in   Victoria.

 I found a clear wish in Mauritius, Kenya and Zimbabwe to   develop closer trade and commercial links with Australia,   particularly as these countries also strongly desire to reduce   their dependence on South African sources. ,

 I made it clear that Australian expertise and technology have   ready application in a number of product and service areas.

 4 .

 In particular, my discussions in these countries identified   agricultural development and minerals exploitation and   processing as areas of great interest and commercial .   potential.

 A trade mission" of Australian business representatives will   visit Zimbabwe and Mauritius in May this year to explore at   first hand the opportunities for increased commercial contact   between these countries and Australia.

 To succeed in these countries, Australian corporations will   need to be competitive and innovative in their approach.

 The effort is worth making. "

 These are countries with an Indian Ocean focus in their   worldview, a novel experience for Australian companies, and   they offer long-term prospects for Australia.

 Australia must recognise at the same time that these countries   need assistance to develop their own export capabilities.

 My Department for instance, will be extending such assistance   to exporters in Zimbabwe to help them promote their products in   Australia.

 The Middle East is an area of primary trading importance to   Australia, with two-way trade of almost $3 billion last   financial year.

 During my visit, I signed bilateral trade agreements with   Jordan, Egypt and Israel.

 These agreements will facilitate closer economic and trading   relationships, an important aspect being the establishment of   joint committees in which business will have a dynamic role.

 In my trade discussions in the Middle East, I emphasised   Australia's wish to strengthen and broaden our commercial   relationship with the region beyond the present emphasis on   commodity trade.

 I was able to highlight the suitability of Australian   technological expertise in a number of manufacturing and   services areas of relevance to the region's development needs.

 5.

 In addition, I was able to talk directly with customers in the   $309.7 million a year market for Australian wheat in Egypt and   in the $58.4 million Yemen Arab Republic market,  for example,   where our market share is under threat.

 Moreover, at the meeting of heads of Australian missions in the   Middle East —  attended for the first time by senior officers   of Austrade working in the region -- we discussed integrated   strategies to pursue Australian economic and political . interests in the region.

 Australia's influence on regional political events is naturally   limited but we do have obligations and interests in these   events.

 One such development is the war between Iran and Iraq;

 The continuation of this war threatens our important trading   links with both countries.

 It also imposes limits on our capacity to expand these links,   it has to be said that the Iran-Iraq conflict is being   complicated by the involvement of several nations in the supply   of arms to both combatants.

 This is an obviously important factor militating against   solution.

 It certainly emphasises the urgency and necessity of controls   on conventional as well as nuclear weapons.

 The conflict between Israelis and Arabs is especially   significant to Australia.

 Nearly half a million Australians of Jewish and Arab origin   have a direct and often personal interest in this tragic and   complex issue.

 My visit to the region immediately preceded that of Secretary   George Shultz and took place in the atmosphere created by his   attempt to bring the disputants together. .

 6 .

 The issue was therefore the most significant in the subjects of   my discussion with leaders in Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Israel   and with Palestinian representatives.

 In these discussions, I made clear our realisation that we were   marginal participants in events and that we were therefore not   in the business of pressing prescriptions on those who were   central to the issue.

 I made clear also Australia's strong view that the Shultz   initiative and those of King Hussein and President Mubarak   should be taken up as rare opportunities to begin the process   of settlement.

 I was able to convey directly to Mr Shultz my impressions of   the attitudes of leaders centrally involved and, in the light   of these attitudes, to offer what I know our American friends   appreciated as constructive suggestions.

 While I was in Israel, I expressed to Prime Minister Shamir and   Foreign Minister Peres (through a letter from our Prime   Minister and in my own words) the deep concern felt in   Australia -- as a friend of Israel -- about the continuing  

 violence in the occupied territories.

 I was able to see for myself in Gaza the legacy of hatred being   created by the continuing inability of all involved to agree to   solve the Palestinian issue through negotiations based on   acceptance of the rights of Israel to exist within secure and  

 recognised boundaries and of the Palestinians to   self-determination.

 During the return leg of my journey,  I took the opportunity to   visit Singapore and Indonesia and Maldives, our Indian Ocean   neighbour.

 My visits to Singapore and Indonesia were part of our   commitment to maintaining regular contacts with these important   regional partners.

 They were also my first as Minister responsible for trade.

 I ensured that my program reflected this new responsibility in   the fullest measure, in my discussion with Ministerial   counterparts and business representatives.

 7.

 My visit in Jakarta,  of course, offered the chance of another   in the regular exchanges I have maintained with Foreign   Minister Mochtar, who is a good friend to Australia.

 A full agenda of discussion with Dr Mochtar included the issue   of Kampuchea (on which Indonesia has continued to play a major   role), progress on the Timor Gap question, the illegal entry   into Australian waters of Indonesian fishing boats and access   to Indonesia by Australian journalists.

 In Maldives, trade matters were an important item of discussion   with the emphasis on expanding our existing commercial links.

 Our aid program was also discussed.

 It was valuable to.gain Maldivian views, particularly on topics   bearing on our common interests in the Indian Ocean.

 My visits to Maldives and South East Asia illustrate the extent   and diversity of the regional diplomatic agenda for Australia.

 We must focus simultaneously on both the economic and political   level on the Indian Ocean, North Asian, South East Asian and   South West Pacific areas. .

 The days are long gone when we could strike political postures   against China, for example, while pursuing a trading   relationship with China. ,

 Striking the right balance, judging the trade-offs costs in   competing national priorities, deploying scarce government   resources in the maximum national benefit: these are complex, connected strands in our diplomacy which have to be pursued   with sublety as well as energy if we are to protect and   preserve Australia’s vital interests.

 This raised the second point of significance about my visit.

 This is that the issue with which it dealt exemplify in many   ways the complexities in the conduct of diplomacy nowadays.

 By this I mean such issues as disarmament and Superpower   relations, for example; the international economic and trade   systems;  human rights, the effects of racism and colonialism;   and the condition of Australia as a multicultural community.

 This hypocrisy does Australia great harm in the Commonwealth   and. elsewhere. .

 Nothing could be better timed to show the inherent inhumanity   of apartheid then the case of the Sharpeville Six.

 Six people not directly involved in a violent incident are   about to be hanged as a gesture towards the South African   Government's attempts to prop up its apartheid system.

 I regret also that the Opposition's position on Southern Africa   shows a dangerous myopia about Indian Ocean affairs.

 This is a region which is so important to our strategic   interests and our trade and communications links that we   consult annually with the United States on developments there.

 These developments have great significance for us.

 This is why we have increased our diplomatic and defence   presence there since 1983.

 It is why we have such an active interest in encouraging the   work of the Indian Ocean Commission and the concept of the   Indian Ocean Zone of Peace.

 One searches in vain through Opposition pronouncements for some   recognition of this.

 The point will not be lost on Western Australians.

 Another point of "significance about the Opposition's reaction   to the issues raised by my visit is the degree of   misunderstanding —  indeed, ignorance -- about the conduct of   policy towards the Asia-pacific region. '

 The Opposition makes typically vague and unsubstantiated   allegations that the Government has "dissipated" its resources   and energies in the region.

 I think my friends opposite should be introduced to a few facts   on this point.

 Apart froin my Department's specialist resources at home, almost   half of all its policy staff overseas are working in this   region.

 There are, in addition, officers working in the region from   such departments and organisations such as AIDAB, Australian   Federal Police, Customs, Department of Industry, Local   Government and Ethnic Affairs, Defence and Armed Services,   Department of Primary Industry and Energy, and Department of   Special Minister of State, Austrade, Treasury, Education.

 Since this Government came to office, there have been 192   Ministerial visits to countries in the region and 144 visits to   Australia by Ministers of Asian and Pacific governments.

 In the first half of this year alone, continuous, active   contact with the region has taken place or is planned.

 I instance visits to China by the Minister for Industry,   Technology and Commerce, and the Minister for Trade   Negotiations on the occasion of the Joint Ministerial Economic   Commission.

 The Minister for Industry, Technology & Commerce has also   visited Hong Kong and Thailand.

 The Minister for Employment, Education and Training visited   Hong Kong and Korea.

 Other activities include:

 Trade discussions with China, Japan and Korea; further   development of bilateral strategies for Japan and Korea;,   development of concessional financial arrangements with China   to promote Australian commercial participation in Chinese   economic development; and development of beef strategies for   Japan and Korea.

 I plan to visit Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and the Philippines   next month and Japan again and China later in the year.

 Later in the year, apart from visits to South East Asia by   other Ministers, I plan to continue the Australian presence at   the annual meeting of Foreign Ministers of ASEAN dialogue   partners with their ASEAN colleagues -- an activity to which   the Government attaches the highest priority.

 11.

 Australia has consistently supported the efforts of those   Governments which are trying to find a practical and lasting   solution to the Kampuchean problem, which is a major source of   tension in the region.

 The Opposition continues to express fear about the relationship   with Indonesia, especially since the reaction by the Indonesian   Government to Australian media criticism in 1986.

 Despite this reaction, there has been continuous and productive   engagement between the two countries since then at all levels.

 There have been six visits to Indonesia by Australian   Ministers, including two by me.

 Defence contacts have continued; so have negotiations over the   Timor Gap,  which are making very encouraging progress.

 Australian investment in Indonesia has increased.

 Indonesia will be represented at Expo 88.

 Access to Indonesia has now been granted to AAP and there is a   reasonable prospect of access being given also the ABC.

 I plan to make a comprehensive visit to the South Pacific again   this year.

 This will repeat my visit to the area in 1986, when I visited   all eight independent island states plus New Caledonia -- the   first ever such action by an Australian Foreign Minister.

 I have made subsequent visits to this area.

 Australia will continue to take part in the South Pacific Forum   meeting at the highest level.

 We continue to play a full,role within the Forum in developing   regional institutions on security and other strategic interests   in South Pacific countries.

 12.

 We continue to co-operate with other Forum members on   rationalising and strengthening regional organisations.

 We have enhanced the trading prospects of South pacific island   nations by our comprehensive liberalisation of the SPARTECA   Agreement and we are exploring areas of possible broader trade   and economic co-operation.

 We have significantly increased our aid to South Pacific island   nations.

 Papua New Guinea continues to be a principal focus for the   Government.

 The Prime Minister and PNG Prime Minister Wingti signed a Joint   Declaration of Principles late last year which will guide the   conduct of the bilateral relationship into the future.

 Trade will be an increasingly important element in relations   and the Government is actively engaged in a review of our trade   agreement with PNG.

 Despite problems induced by New Zealand's policy on United   States ship visits ANZUS, which is such a significant factor in   regional security continues to be fully in force between   Australia and the United States and, separately, Australia and   New Zealand.

 We played an active role in creating the South Pacific Nuclear   Free Zone.

 The Hon Member for North Sydney has described this development   a s " a  nonsense".

 It shows how little he understands the region and how greatly   he patronises it.

 The Treaty is the result not just of the policy of the   Australian Government but also the strongly -- and widely —   held views and desires of members of the South Pacific Forum.

 Finally, the Australian Government has actively promoted   constructive relationships between Western governments and the   island states. '

 13.

 We strongly encouraged the US, for instance, to enter a treaty   with the island governments to redress the problems of US tuna   fishing in the area.

 We have encouraged Japan to develop its relations -- especially   its economic co-operation -- with the island states.

 We have encouraged France to develop its relations in the area   in a manner consistent with the interests of the people of the   South Pacific as expressed through the Forum.

 The Leader of the Opposition said in his Hobart speech that "Mr   Hawke announced in Singapore that he would welcome   'constructive *  Soviet political involvement in the Asia/Pacific   region".

 The Prime Minister did say in Sinagpore that he would welcome a   constructive involvement by the Soviets in the region but he   went on to say that they would be judged in this not by their   words but by their actions in (for example) Indochina and  

 Afghanistan.  .

 There is a world of difference in meaning and emphasis between   the two.  .

 There ought to be some ,kind of limit to the degree of liberty   to distort allowed to the Leader of the Opposition who, after   all, purports to be the alternative Prime Minister.

 We have embarked on policies to increase the competitiveness   and productivity of Australian industry.

 We have set in train programs of structual reform in industry   and greater flexibility in the economy.

 These activities are designed to reverse Australia's   traditional low export orientation so as to take advantage of   the economic development taking place in this region.

 The Government of which the Leader of the Opposition was a   senior member saw the necessity for this but never had the   courage to attempt it.

 14.

 The point is important because on of the results of this   activity has been continued export growth in a difficult   trading environment. .

 Between 1983-1984 and 1986-1987, the rate of growth in exports   (that is, export receipts adjusted for inflation) to China, for   instance was nearly 30 percent, more than triple the rate of   growth over the period 1975-76 to 1982-83.

 To Japan,  the growth rate from 1983-84 to 1986-87 was nearly 5   percent per annum,  a significant improvement on the negative   real growth rate of the 1975-76 to 1982-83 period and to Hong   Kong exports grew by nearly 14 percent over the period 1983-84  

 to 1986-87, well up on the 6 percent per annum growth rate over   the 1975-76 to 1982-1983 period. '

 Exports to other countries have also grown strongly in real   terms in recent years :  to South Korea by nearly 9 percent per annum and to the South Pacific (excluding New Zealand) by 3   percent per annum.

 Average annual exports to the ASEAN nations have grown by   nearly six percent,  despite the problems experienced by those   economies during this period.

 The Opposition charges that all this activity constitutes   neglect.

 The kindest explanation for this is that its advisers have not   kept it abreast of developments which are having such an   influence on our developments as a force for economic and   strategic progress and stability in our region.

 While all this progress has been taking place, we have heard   nothing but negativism from the Opposition.

 It is constantly trying to denigrate the country and its   economic performance -- in the process, trying to instil   uncertainty in quarters overseas which are involved in our now   more open economy.

 I am reminded of the Leader of the Opposition's speech in the   US in July 1986 where he spent fully 20 minutes criticising his   own country before an audience of foreigners. ·

 15.

 It may be permissible (although I hardly think it advisable)   constantly to denigrate one's own country at home.

 But, to do so while overseas, is a shameful and unpatriotic   act.

 The Leader of the Opposition should still be embarrassed about   it two years on.

 Another regrettable Opposition misconception is that this   Government has damaged the relationship with the US with   "gratuitous criticism".

 The fact is that certain aspects of US economic and trade   policy directly affect and even jeopardise our industry,   especially agriculture.

 This has been recognised by the all-party delegations sent to '

 the US by this Parliament in 1986 and 1987. .

 It is certainly in line with comments by the OECD.

 If the Government had not pointed this out to our American   friends in a forceful but constructive way, it would have   failed in its duty.

 If the Government had not made the point -- and lobbied   energetically for it with both the Congress and the   Administration -- some elements of the US Trade Bills with   particular impact on Australia would not have been dropped or  

 modified.

 I refer, for example, to the failure of proposals which would   have affected our exports of sugar.

 In the meantime, we continue to be concerned with the   protectionist tone of the proposed US trade legislation which   could increase the power of the US aggressively to pursue   bilateral solutions to trade problems. '

 This form of trade has never effectively come under GATT   rules.

 It represents one of the most distorted sectors of world   trade.

 Australia’s active role in the Cairns Group is intended to   ensure that our interests will be effectively represented in   trade negotiations.

 The final difference on foreign policy between the Government   and Opposition which I wish to discuss today is probably the   most important.

 It concerns the timid, derivative and dependent outlook   permeating the Opposition's policy, as displayed in its   Leader's Hobart speech.

 â   .  ·  y 

 This is an attitude which the electorate quite properly rejected in 1983, 1984 and again in 1987.

 Taken to its logical conclusion, it would oppose, rather than   encourage, moves by the Superpowers to develop greater accord   on crucial strategic issues, especially disarmament and arms   control.

 The Australian Government has done all it can to facilitate   this process in multilateral forums such as the UN General   Assembly, Security Council and the Conference on Disarmament.

 We have actively encouraged the process which has produced the   INF Treaty, the first treaty actually to reduce the number of   nuclear:weapons. .

 We welcome the treaty also because it sets important precedents   for other arms control measures.  '

 It applies asymmetrical force reductions, for example, and its   verification arrangements are uniquely intrusive and   co-operative.

 Eliminating medium-range missiles in Asia as well as' Europe, it   has particular relevance to us in that it reduced the threat to   Asian targets which are significant to us - - f o r  example,  in   China, Japan and the Philippines.

 Moreover,  it represents a significant improvement in Superpower   relations which only ideologues and the most reactionary Cold   War Warriors would deplore.

 Mr Shultz has welcomed the constructive dialogue now taking   place between the Superpowers.

 The NATO communique earlier this month hailed what it called   "welcome signs of change" in Soviet policies which created "the   prospect for greater openness in (Soviet) relations with their   own people and with other nations".

 A summit meeting will be held in Moscow between President   Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev probably in May at which   arms control and disarmament issues will be prominent.

 Mr Shultz and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze are meeting on a   monthly basis in the meantime. *

 The Opposition's reaction to these positive developments has   been moans and cries of alarm and suspicion.

 The Australian Government does not hold these current signs of   change w i t h f e a r  and loathing,  as the Opposition does.

 It welcomes the INF Treaty as an example of these changes.

 It will co-operate actively with those nations which are trying   to utilise the Treaty ih the cause of further arms control.

 Australia will (for example) continue to work actively for a   comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, an agreement to   eliminate chemical weapons, and agreement to prevent an arms   race in space and to control and reduce the use of conventional  

 weapons.

 There is an important point here.

 The Superpower relationship is not the only area of change in   international affairs.

 The Opposition clearly has no pride'in this country, its   capacities and the respect it has earned overseas for its   actions.

 This is why its Leader travels around, putting his country down   here and overseas.

 Australians as a whole on the other hand, are showing that they   are prepared to accept the change confronting them as an   opportunity for progress and development.

 In this, they will receive the fullest possible encouragement   and assistance from the Australian Government.
