  ONE NATION’S IMMIGRATION PROGRAM UNWORKABLE

  

  One Nation’s I mmigration program, as outlined today, is so 
seriously flawed it is completely unworkable, the Minister for Immigration, 
Philip Ruddock, said today.

  

 Mr Ruddock said One Nation has again failed to support 
its Immigration rhetoric with policy by refusing to spell out which 
categories of migration would be scrapped or capped under its Zero Net 
Migration Program.

  

 “One Nation Leader, Pauline Hanson, today said Australia’s 
Immigration program would consist of simply replacing the people who 
leave Australia each year which is around 30,000.

  

 “However, she has failed to tell us what would be 
cut from either the current Migration Program of 68,000, or the Refugee/Humanitarian 
Program of 12,000 people, to meet this reduced figure.

  

 “In fact, according to Ms Hanson, Australia would 
continue to accept refugees, would continue to allow family reunion, 
and would continue to accept migrants on the basis of what they have 
to offer this country.

  

 “Even a cursory examination of the facts show that 
the numbers simply do not add up.

  

 “If, based on an intake of 30,000, Australia continued 
to accept refugees, as Ms Hanson says we would, there would only be 
18,000 places left.

  

 “This remaining quota would not even accommodate 
the 24,000 Australians who, each year, meet their life partner overseas 
and seek to bring them into Australia.

  

 “Nor would it have room for the entry of 2,000 dependant 
children of Australian citizens who will enter Australia during the 
next year.

  

 “This then begs the question of how One Nation would, 
as Ms Hanson said this morning, select migrants   ‘who have got something to offer this country’.

  

 “Quite simply, there would be no room left to accept 
migrants through Australia’s Skilled Migration Program, which currently 
accommodates 35,000 people. This would deny all Australians the significant 
economic benefits skilled migration produces”.

  

 Ms Hanson also said this morning:

  

  ‘I think there should be a test on English. I think everyone should 
have some knowledge of the English language. They must have the basics 
of known English’.

  

 “These propositions are absurd in the least This 
would deny ordinary Australians the right to marry people who did not 
speak English, and would not allow Australians to bring there own children 
into Australia if they didn’t speak English.

  

 “This also means Australia’s Refugee and Humanitarian 
Program would only be allowed to grant entry to English speakers.

  

 “Some of Australia’s great citizens have come 
to this country with little of no English language ability and have 
gone on to make outstanding contributions. Sir Peter Abeles and Sir 
Arvi Parbo are two such individuals”.

  

 Mr Ruddock also said Pauline Hanson’s continued 
insistence that potential migrants be assessed on their ability to assimilate, 
and that they   ‘must want to be Australian’,  implies that some new settlers 
are   not   Australian.

  

  “It is unfair in the least to imply that some individuals in this 
country are not Australian simply due to their heritage.

  

  “This is clearly a message about dividing Australia, not uniting 
us”.

  

  **Mr Ruddock will hold a Press Conference at 2.OOPM today at 146 Beecroft 
Road (Cnr Murray Street), Beecroft, SYDNEY**
