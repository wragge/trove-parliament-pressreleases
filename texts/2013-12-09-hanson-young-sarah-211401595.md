 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Monday, 9 December 2013   

 Morrison jumps the shark, Greens  introduce bill to cap Minister’s cruelty   

 The Australian Greens have introduced a bill into the Senate today that would give the  Parliament power to veto any visa caps and freezes proposed by the Immigration  Minister.   

 “The Minister is obsessed with cruelty and, by putting a freeze on all protection visas,  he’s clearly jumped the shark,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young said.   

 “The Minister has shown that he can’t be trusted with this level of power. The Greens’ bill  would put visa caps and freezes in the hands of the Parliament so that this can’t happen  again.   

 “Throwing a hissy fit and taking it out on thousands of refugees because the government  didn’t get its way in the Senate is simply unacceptable.   

 “This government has lost sight of what it means to be a caring, generous nation in an  international community and our reputation is being tarnished.   

 “The Minister’s power must be checked to ensure that the Parliament can temper his  thuggish, bullying approach to vulnerable people looking for protection.”
