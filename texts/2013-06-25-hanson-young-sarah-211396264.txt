 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Tuesday, 25 June 2013   

 Children need care, not damaging detention   

 The Australian Government must listen to the National Children’s Commissioner and her calls  for children to be removed from immigration detention in Australia while also removing the  remaining children that are being held on Manus Island, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “There are thousands of refugee children languishing in Australian detention centres and that  simply isn’t good enough,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young  said.   

 “This policy is creating a damaged generation, for which Australia will be deeply sorry in years to  come.   

 “The government is knowingly harming the mental health of vulnerable children in Australia just  because they came to us asking for protection as refugees.   

 “It is also unacceptable that there are children still suffering in the prison camp on Manus Island.   

 “One child in detention is too many, but thousands being held behind bars is a national disgrace.   

 “The No Advantage rule and its cuts to the family reunion scheme have meant that many more  children are now arriving by boat.   

 “The Houston Panel’s deterrence measures and the shameful No Advantage test have failed.   

 “The Greens will stand up for vulnerable refugees in Australia and our region until we return to a  more caring response to the significant humanitarian crisis in our region.”
