 Senator Bob Brown   Senator for Tasmania    

 PM should not consult Jakarta on West Papuan refugee detail - Greens 

 

 Senator Brown, 7th April 2006   

 Prime Minister John Howard would breach international law if he were to consult  Jakarta about individual refugees from West Papua, Greens Leader Bob Brown said  today.    

 "West Papuans seeking refuge in Australia have a legal right to anonymity," Senator  Brown said.    

 "The spectre of terrorism is now being used by Prime Minister Howard, to deprive  West Papuans of their rights and he should say what he has in mind in reviewing  those rights."  

 

 "Mr Howard would do well to consult West Papuans before announcing what is good  for them," Senator Brown said.
