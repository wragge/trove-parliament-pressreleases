 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 Labor's 'never-never' solution on illegal  boat arrivals   11/07/10  

 Minister Brendan O’Connor has today confirmed what everyone already knew, that  the Gillard Labor Government will not have an offshore processing centre in place if  re-elected, Federal Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison  said. 

 “Labor’s asylum policy has become the ‘never never’ solution, as further  contradictions and inconsistencies appear as Labor ministers line up desperately to  explain a plan that doesn’t exist,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “Today, Ministers O’Connor and Smith seemed to contradict each other over the  status of discussions with Papua New Guinea while Minister O’Connor refused to  guarantee that a Gillard Labor Government would even have their off shore  processing centre established within the next term of Government if re-elected,” he  said. 

 “By contrast the Coalition in government established an offshore processing centre  operated by the International Organisation for Migration with one third of all  processing conducted by the UNHCR within 19 days of the centre being announced 

 by the then Prime Minister. 

 “The centre on Nauru announced in September was operational before the 2001  election was held in October. That is what real action looks like. 

 “The centre operated for over six years and the number of illegal boats arriving fell to  an average of just three per year. 

 “The centre was closed by the Labor Government in 2008, along with the abolition of  temporary protection visas and their promise made before the 2007 election to be  prepared to turn back boats where the circumstances allowed. Today boats are  illegally arriving at a rate of three per week. 

 “This is a Government that found a solution and created a problem. 

 “Now, in a desperate attempt to resuscitate their plan, they have put our international  reputation at risk by verballing the Bali Process set up by the Coalition back in 2002  with Indonesia to address people smuggling and irregular people movement in the  region. 

 “As a co-chair of the Bali Process, the Indonesian Government through their Foreign  Minister has expressed great concern on being sideswiped by Labor Ministers who  have attempted to verbal the Bali Process to give undeserved credibility to Julia  Gillard’s ill considered thought bubble. 

 “The Bali process has focused on issues such as extradition, information sharing,  identification processes and criminalization of people smuggling. 

 “The Indonesians rightly do not want to see this important and worthy process  demeaned by Julia Gillard attempting to use it as a prop for her election quick fix. 

 “A regional processing centre has never been on the agenda of the Bali Process. As  recently as last June officials met and there was no record of any discussion of the  need for a regional processing centre. 

 “The establishment of a regional processing centre runs the significant risk of  becoming an asylum magnet for asylum seekers from other parts of the world, in  particular the Middle East. No wonder there is little enthusiasm for the proposal. 

 “Prime Minister Gillard is abusing the Bali Process to suit her own political interest,  rather than pursue Australia’s national interest and the region's interest. 

 “Labor’s bungled asylum policy is damaging our relations with our regional  neighbours and has time and again been exposed for what it is - a cynical election fix  that has no hope of reality,” Mr Morrison said.
