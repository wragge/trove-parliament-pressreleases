  JOINT STATEMENT

  YOUNG PEOPLE FROM NON-ENGLISH-SPEAKING BACKGROUNDS TO 

  BENEFIT FROM YOUNG AUSTRALIA 

  Young people from non-English-speaking backgrounds will benefit from the measures in  The Federal Government's Youn~ Australia Statement, the Minister for Employment,  Education, and Training, Simon Crean, and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education  and Training, Ross Free, said today. 

  Included in today's announcements are measures to assist homeless and "at risk"  jobseekers, especially those from non-English speaking background. Greater assistance  will be provided for those young people with English language difficulties, as well as more  support for those entering the labour market and greater assistance in the field of enterprise  training and development. 

  Mr Crean said today's initiatives were building on the successes already achieved for  rnigrantjobseekers under Working Nation. 

  "Young Australia builds on the Migrant Service Improvement Strategy, in particular , which  has seen $130 million per annum for English as a Second Language; the introduction of 51  Migrant Liaison Officers in the Department of Employment, Education and Training  (DEET) who are involved in a number of key initiatives to improve employment outcomes  for these jobseekers; upgraded consultation with migrant groups and the extension of the  New Enterprise Incentive Scheme to Migrant Resource Centres," Mr Crean said. 

  â‘Building on the outstanding success of the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme for migrants,  young people from non English speaking backgrounds will now be able to play a more  active role in enterprise activities through the Youth Enterprise Strategy . 

  Mr Crean said the strategy will promote enterprise activity, particularly self-employment,  as a career option for young Australians, providing them with valuable opportunities to  develop enterprise skills, including putting them on the road to viable self-employment  careers. 

  "The Youth Enterprise Strategy is an integrated approach to help young people to take up  an active role in enterprise activities in schools, training programs, further education, the  labour market and the small business sector," Mr Crean said. 

  The Government will assist more than 1000 young people to set up viable self " employment ventures under the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. Through the  Commonwealth Enterprise Education in Schools Program, curriculum materials will be  developed to support enterprise and business education in schools over the next four years.

  "Young migrantjobseekers will also particularly benefit from the Homeless Youth and  Refuge Action Program (HYRAP) which develops best practice models for coordinated  case management and service provision," Mr Free said. 

  "Building on the experience of the JPET and HARY AP projects, the Government will  introduce a total program of assistance for disadvantaged homeless, at risk and refugee  young people, whether unemployed or returning to education. 

  "The development of a program which includes young refugees provides a framework-for  the Government to respond to the needs of a group which has been identified as needing  special assistance, such as English as a second language," Mr Free added. 

  Mr Crean said the Government would also expand the scope of the program of assistance  provided to young migrants and other disadvantaged young people entering the labour  market to include those returning to education or being placed in training and would  increase the period of assistance from 13 to 26 weeks. 

  Under new arrangements, former Youthâ‘ Training Initiative clients will now be eligible for  up to 26 weeks of continuing support after they enter employment or training or return to  education. This extended support can include mentoring, counselling, crisis intervention,  training of co-workers or tutors, assistance with literacy /numeracy or ESL needs, or extra  vocational training or tutoring. 

  "The Working Nation enhancements of October 1995 announced the appointment of 52  Youth Liaison Officers, the use oflnternet to help improve communications with young  people and the Jobs Pathway Guarantee to link training and jobs for students completing a  year 12 vocational training program. These initiatives will also improve training and  employment outcomes for young people from non-English-speaking backgrounds," Mr  Crean said. 

  These young people are also able to access specialist contracted case managers who  provide individualised assistance and counselling. To date, the Employment Services  Regulatory Authority (ESRA) has contracted 30 case management or,ganisations (at 55  sites) to provide specialist services to youth and 23 case management organisations (at 38  sites) to provide specialist services for young people from non-English-speaking  backgrounds. 

  Mr Crean said that Ethnic Employment Liaison Officers (ELOs) are promoting and  supporting the involvement of ethnic employers in the implementation of Workine Nation  initiatives . ELOs are developing strategies to assist and encourage members of employer  organisations to become involved in employment and training programs. 

  Through these strategies, employer stereotypes of young people from non English speaking  backgrounds are being broken down and ethnic community employers are being  encouraged to provide them with employment and training opportunities .
