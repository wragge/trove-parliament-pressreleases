 Australian Greens Media Release   

 Friday, 19 October 2012   

 Labor and Coalition in race to the bottom on  immigration policy   

 The Labor Party and Tony Abbott’s coalition are auctioning off the lives off refugees in a bid to  implement the most inhumane immigration policies, the Australian Greens said.   

 “The Government refuses to say what ‘no advantage’ means, but we now know that the  Opposition plans to destroy people by sending them to Nauru and Manus Island for at least five  years,” Greens immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Being subjected to those inhumane conditions for five years will ruin the vulnerable children  who will be sent there and will turn sane, strong and proud people mad.   

 “We saw refugee’s mental health deteriorate because of long-term detention under the Howard  regime, and now the Government and the Opposition are trying to outdo each other when it  comes to damaging these vulnerable people.   

 “The Australian Greens have long said that 12 months is the absolute maximum time anyone  should spend in detention.   

 “The Government needs to stop hiding behind the hollow spin of the ‘no advantage’ test.   

 “The only definition of the ‘no advantage’ test is indefinite detention and, as the UNHCR has  said, it cannot be applied.   

 “The Opposition says it will focus exclusively on deterrence rather than working with our  neighbour countries to provide safer pathways for refugees, which we know is the only viable  way to reduce the number of boats arriving.   

 “The Coalition plans to implement a policy that will destroy the lives of countless vulnerable  refugees and set up an inhumane offshore warehouse for human beings.”
