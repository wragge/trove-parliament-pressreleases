 MEDIA RELEASE   

 DIAC outreach officers to visit Pilbara 

 Tuesday, 18 September 2007 

 Officers from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) will be in the remote  Pilbara region of Western Australia next week for a regional outreach visit. 

 Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Kevin Andrews said the outreach trips were a great  way for people in regional areas to sit down and talk about immigration-related issues face-to-face with DIAC officers. 

 'The Australian Government places great importance on providing services to regional areas  and these visits are a large part of that,' Mr Andrews said. 

 'These appointments attract a range of people, from small business owners to farmers, and  community groups to individuals, who might want information or just someone to talk them  through a complex matter. 

 'While the department has a great deal of information available over the phone or on the  internet, some people prefer to speak to officers face-to-face and these visits are about  meeting that need. 

 'In the past, the most popular topics related to citizenship, work visas, visas for family  members and how to propose and sponsor refugees,' the Minister added. 

 The DIAC team will be in Port Hedland on Monday, September 24, Newman on Tuesday,  September 25, Tom Price and Paraburdoo on Wednesday, September 26, Onslow on  Thursday, September 27 and Karratha on Friday, September 28. Bookings for consultations at  all venues can be made by calling (08) 9365 7433.
