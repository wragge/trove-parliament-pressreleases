 Close Nauru now: Greens    

 As the Australian Government’s offshore detention regime stares down the barrel of another  embarrassing legal defeat it should read the writing on the wall and make the honourable  choice by shutting its island prisons now, the Australian Greens said.    

 “I welcome the legal challenge because these vulnerable refugees deserve to be defended, even  if the Australian Government has washed its hands of its obligations to give them protection,”  the Greens immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “It is a sad state of affairs when a group of Australian lawyers has to band together to try and  make their own government obey its international human rights obligations.    

 “The government’s eagerness to beat up on refugees, including children and their families, in  this race to the bottom with the coalition is embarrassing our country on an international stage.    

 “The government also needs to let the Australian public know whether it plans to support Nauru  with any funding or legal advice throughout this court case.    

 “The Nauru and Manus Island detention centres are hot houses of mental illness and injustice  and they need to be shut down, whether by legal challenge or the Australian Government.”
