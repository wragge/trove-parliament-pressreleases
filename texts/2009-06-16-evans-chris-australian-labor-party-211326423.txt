 Australia remains committed to protecting refugees  

 The plight of refugees from strife-torn Sudan highlights the importance of Australia's  contribution to international refugee protection, the Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, said today. 

 Opening a photographic exhibition at Parliament House featuring images taken by  young Sudanese refugees from the Darfur region, Senator Evans said Australia's  humanitarian program will continue to focus on the resettlement of people forced into  refugee camps. 

 ‘Through the humanitarian program, Australia has assisted in resettling some of the  worst affected people from Africa, Asia and the Middle East,’ Senator Evans said. 

 ‘With the support of the Australian Government and the Australian community,  refugees are able to come to Australia and live free from fear of the persecution and  terrible violence that they experienced in their home countries. 

 ‘Many of these people have languished in refugee camps for years with no possibility  of returning to their home so the international community must step in and help  resettle them.’ 

 Since the onset of violent conflict in Sudan in 2003, more than three million people -  mostly women and children - have been displaced within the Darfur region and are  living in isolated refugee camps.  

 ‘In the past 10 years, about 20 000 Sudan-born people have made Australia their  new home. So many have defied the odds and made a success of their lives in  Australia in the business, health, academic and arts sectors, to name a few,’ Senator  Evans said. 

 ‘With the challenges of displacement increasing worldwide, it is more important than  ever that Australia steps up to the mark in sharing international responsibility for  refugee protection.’ 

 Australia continues to be an international leader in refugee resettlement and in 2009-10 will welcome 13 750 people under its Humanitarian Program. This represents a 

 boost of 250 places last year and the second year running in which the program has  increased. 

 The main resettlement focus will continue to be on refugees from the three key  regions of Africa, Asia and the Middle East. 

 The photographic exhibition Far to Here is a selection of still images from the works of young  people in the Darfur community in Australia, expressing how they viewed their life in  Australia and the positive differences made since their arrival. The Parliament House  exhibition coincides with Refugee Week, which this year has the theme, Freedom from fear.
