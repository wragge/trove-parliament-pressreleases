 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 16 August 2013   

 Labor: no advantage, Coalition: no shame   

 The Opposition’s shameful announcement today of a fast-track for refugees to potential danger and  the reintroduction of TPVs shows how low they are willing to go in the race to the bottom against an  increasingly conservative Labor Party.   

 “Labor has ‘No Advantage’ and now the Coalition has ‘No Shame’,” the Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “It’s clear that this policy has nothing to do with deterrence as it will only impact on the people who  have already arrived in Australia. This is all about looking tough in the lead up to an election.   

 “Part of the policy announced today is to detain children, potentially for the rest of their lives. No  Australian could think that’s fair.   

 “Resurrecting Howard’s Temporary Protection Visas is shameful and will, once again, increase the  number of women and children coming to Australia on boats.   

 “Mr Abbott’s reference to the “happy situation that was brought about by the Howard government”  today conveniently ignores the trauma, pain and suffering that was inflicted upon refugees in that  period.   

 “Abolishing the Refugee Review Tribunal, a last chance hope to avoid returning people to danger  and possible death, is a reckless and cruel move.   

 “The Greens are the only party in the Australian Parliament that is standing up for refugees and  offering a genuine regional solution that would save lives at sea.”
