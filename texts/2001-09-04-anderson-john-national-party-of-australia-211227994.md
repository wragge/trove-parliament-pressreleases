 Good News Week for Country Australia

 A121/2001 4th September 2001

 It has been a momentous week for country Australians, with large steps being taken towards resolving some of the biggest problems facing the nation, the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, John Anderson, said today.

 “The overnight movement of asylum seekers from the sea near Christmas Island to Port Moresby, en route to Nauru and New Zealand, has sent a strong message to those who would traffic in human cargo,” Mr Anderson said.

 “Australia is not a soft touch and will take firm measures to protect its borders from illegal intrusion. The support from country Australia for this stand has been overwhelming”

 At the same time, Australia has made great strides in the past few days towards overcoming other problems that have caused considerable concern - and economic harm - for many years.

 “The United States decision to finally remove its tariff rate quota on Australian lamb exports proves that the system can work for our farm producers.

 “Make no mistake, the world market is still corrupted by US and European subsidies and other artificial trade barriers. But our protests to the World Trade Organisation on the lamb export issue were successful, meaning that from November 15 Australian lamb producers will have unrestricted access to the US market.”

 Australia is now exporting more than it imports, thanks largely to a record $30 billion this year in rural exports.

 “In fact, Australia’s net foreign debt is falling for the first time in many years.

 “This is further confirmation of three things - rural and regional Australians are more than pulling their weight in the export race, this Government is a responsible economic manager, and Labor’s record in economic management confirms its inability to govern.

 “Many Australians are rightly concerned about our foreign debt. In itself, foreign debt is not a bad thing, particularly when it is used to fund new and important investment and jobs in this country.

 “But it is a problem when the cost of servicing that private debt becomes too great, or governments run up too much debt, as the Hawke and Keating Labor Government did.

 “Since 1996, this Coalition has paid off more than $50 billion of the $90 billion government debt it inherited from the Keating Government’s Finance Minister, Kim Beazley. This allows us to spend about four thousand million dollars a year of taxpayer’s money on health, education and roads; money that would otherwise have been used to service debt.”

 Mr Anderson has also unveiled a package of well-targeted measures to build on the ‘quiet revolution’ that has occurred in rural and regional Australia since 1996.

 “The measures included $100 million over four years for a Sustainable Regions Program to help hard-pressed regions affected by social, economic or environmental change, and $30 million a year to reduce the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service export and associated charges by 40 per cent.

 “These changes have been widely welcomed by most Australians, and the silence from the ALP’s spokespeople must be taken as acceptance that the Government got it right.

 “Our package, Stronger Regions, A Stronger Australia, also detailed how the Liberal-National Government has concentrated on repairing the damage caused by Labor to country Australia between 1983 and 1996. Since then, we have spent $28.5 billion on specific rural and regional programs, on top of money spent nationally.

 “Things are on the improve for many people in rural and regional Australia. The facts bear that out. But what the Liberal-National Government must do — and I have committed us to doing — is to continue to help those that might be paying too heavy a price for government action in the national interest or suffering through changes in technology.”
