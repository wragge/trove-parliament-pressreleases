 No Boats for Twelve Months

 Australia has passed a milestone, with no unauthorised boat arrivals for 12 months showing the success of the Government's  response to people smuggling, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said  today.

 "The last organised attempt to bring a boat load of people to Australia occurred on 17 December 2001, making it now a full  year without a boat. That boat was returned to Indonesia, sending a strong signal to the smugglers," Mr Ruddock said.

 "With 1,200 boat arrivals in the first three weeks of August 2001, and with reports of a further 5,000 in transit countries  waiting to come to Australia, it was clear that if the Government had not acted, we could have had around 12,000 arrivals in  the full year.

 "As a result of the Government's firm actions, significant savings have been made in visa processing costs and people  smugglers have been sent a strong message that the backdoor to Australia is closed."

 Processing on the Australian mainland cost $125m against the $190m provided in the 2001-02 Budget (saving $65m) and a  further saving of $85m for onshore processing of unauthorised boat arrivals was announced in the 2002-03 Budget.

 In addition, processing at offshore centres in Papua New Guinea and Nauru was $112m against a provision of $159m in 2001-02. 

 "Given that there have been no new unauthorised boat arrivals for over 12 months,, processing costs are expected to reduce  considerably in 2002-03 and continue to reduce in subsequent years," Mr Ruddock said.

 As a consequence of the Government's success, detainee population is down, with 1,287 people in mainland immigration  detention (as at 16 December 2002) compared with 3,400 a year before and down from the historical high of 3,721 in August  2001.*

 There has been an even more dramatic reduction in the number of children in detention. Of the 1,282 total in detention, there  are 139 children under the age of 18, which is less than 20 per cent of the total 12 months ago (748 children).

 "By any measure, this comprehensive strategy has been successful, but most importantly, it has stopped people risking their  lives in dangerous journeys organised by unscrupulous people smugglers," Mr Ruddock said.

 "It also allows us to ensure that the asylum system protects those at greatest risk and is not abused by those seeking migration  outcomes."

  *Note: Less than half those detained today are unauthorised boat arrivals. Most detainees are there as a result of compliance  action on overstayers and illegal workers. Of boat arrivals, more than 350 are a vailable for removal having exhausted all  applications.
