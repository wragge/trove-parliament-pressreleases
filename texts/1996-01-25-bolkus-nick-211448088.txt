  IMPROVED TRAINING FOR PEOPLE WORKING WITH REFUGEES 

  - New training arrangements for voluntary groups who help refugees settle in  Australia were announced today by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus . 

  Senator Bolkus said the training will be provided to people working with  refugees most severely affected by their experiences and who do not have  strong family or community support in Australia. 

  "The new arrangements will include training people in understanding the cultural  background of refugees such as gender sensitivity issues; sensitivity to the  effects of torture and trauma and the needs of torture/trauma survivors and the  development of negotiation and advocacy skills," Senator Bolkus said. 

  People who will be offered training will include members of groups registered  with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (DIEA) under the  Community Refugee Settlement Scheme (CRSS) . Voluntary groups belonging to  the scheme undertake to provide support for the refugee families for six months  after their arrival. 

  The new arrangements are being developed by DIEA and the Refugee Council  of Australia -the peak body representing agencies assisting refugees in  Australia and overseas. 

  "High quality training and support structures enable the volunteers to do their.  work effectively and to cope with the effects of sharing, at first hand, the  experiences of the refugees," Senator Bolkus said.
