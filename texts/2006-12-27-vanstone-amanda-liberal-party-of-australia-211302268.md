 Canberra welcomes migrants 

 27 December 2006 

 A building boom, low unemployment and its tree-studded suburbs have made the Australian  Capital Territory an increasingly popular choice for new arrivals to Australia. 

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Amanda Vanstone today said more than 1370  new migrants took up residence in the ACT in 2005-2006, up about 13 per cent on the previous  year’s total of 1217.  

 ‘That’s the highest number of settler arrivals in more than a decade,’ Senator Vanstone said. 

 ‘The Canberra community is to be congratulated for welcoming these people into their lives so  readily and willingly.’ 

 Migrants from 93 countries made the ACT their new home in 2005-2006, with China, the United  Kingdom and India the largest contributors. 

 On the national front, more than 131 000 people arrived and settled in Australia in 2005-2006,  an increase of 8000 on the previous year. 

 The largest number of settlers came from the United Kingdom with 23 290, up by about 5000  on last year. 

 Other European countries contributed about 7000 migrants, while the number of new arrivals  from Sudan fell almost 2000 from the last year to 3783. 

 Iraqi arrival numbers were up almost 500 to 2425, while more than 52 000 people from 34  Asian countries made Australia their new home during 2005-2006. 

 Senator Vanstone said the majority of new arrivals entered Australia through the family and  skill streams of the migration programme. 

 ‘Our migration target for 2006-2007 is about 140,000, including 97,500 in the skill stream and  that number does not include the 13 000 refugee and humanitarian entrants who will begin  new lives in Australia through our humanitarian programme.’     

 The full list of statistics can be found in Settler Arrivals 2005-2006, a Department of  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs publication that has been published on its website at  www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/index.htm.
