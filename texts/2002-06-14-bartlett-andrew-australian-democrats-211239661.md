 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 14 June 2002  MEDIA RELEASE                          02/309

 Crean decision welcome - time to end the Pacific Solution

 The Australian Democrats have welcomed Simon Crean’s decision not to support the further excising of Australia’s northern islands, and strongly urge Labor to now start actively working to unwind the expensive and inhumane Pacific Solution.

 The Democrats indicated a week ago that they would disallow the new Regulation in the Senate.  With Labor, Brian Harradine and Bob Brown on board, the Government’s change is now sure to fail.

 Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said “whilst this decision of Mr Crean’s is welcome, the ALP must now show a willingness to start supporting a winding back of the draconian changes which the Coalition have been allowed to bring into law in recent years.

 “It’s time for the ALP Leader to listen to the growing ground swell of community anger, including in his own Party, at Australia’s unacceptable treatment of refugees, and to work hand-in-hand with the international community in developing a workable, global response to the asylum seeker issue.

 “Hopefully, Labor’s decision will see the end of the Government’s attempts to continually expand the so-called Pacific Solution, which is now in serious trouble.

 “Foreign Minister Alexander Downer is being forced to conduct on-the-run diplomacy with the Nauru President, Rene Harris, today in Adelaide.  Regardless of the platitudes which Mr Downer will bring out of this meeting, the fact is Australia is continuing to waste hundreds of millions of dollars trying to cover up the fact that the Government has no long-term solution to this issue.

 “We now have the scandalous situation where hundreds of people who have been assessed as refugees are still stuck in remote island prison camps, and Australia is paying to keep them there.

 “Unless there are other countries who will take the refugees immediately, Australia should be accepting these refugees into our community now.

 “There are hundreds more who, after ten months, are still imprisoned, with the UN saying they aren’t refugees but at the same time saying it’s not safe for them to return.  Where are these people to go and why should they continue to be imprisoned because their home country is still not safe?  Not to mention, why is Australia continuing to pay the bill?

 “Mr Downer will not answer these questions, because he has no answer.  It is time for Mr Crean to move forward from his decision today, show true leadership and work to bring a halt to the failed Pacific Solution as soon as possible.

 “There are better ways to handle the refugee issue.  It is one thing to oppose the Government’s bad policy, but Labor should be joining the Democrats in highlighting the positive policy alternatives that exist and could be implemented today,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
