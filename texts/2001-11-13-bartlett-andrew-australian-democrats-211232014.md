 DEMOCRATS TO PUSH FOR BROAD INQUIRY INTO REFUGEE POLICY

 Australian Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, today said the Democrats will be pushing hard for a comprehensive inquiry into the costs and impacts of the Government’s policy on handling asylum seekers to be undertaken as soon as possible.

 “Because of the election campaign, and prior to that, the gagging of debate in the Senate, there has been little opportunity to get the facts surrounding this matter, despite it being of great public interest and importance,” said Senator Bartlett.

 Issues that should be examined include:

 â¢ The total costs to date and the likely ongoing costs of the government’s policy; â¢ The impacts of the policy on global efforts to resettle refugees in an ordered, timely and humane manner; â¢ The total numbers of people who have arrived since the time of The Tampa and whether

 numbers have increased or decreased since then; â¢ Who is processing the claims for asylum and what processes are being used; â¢ What is the time being taken to process asylum claims and what legal and other

 information is being made available to claimants; â¢ Where is the likely final destination of both successful and unsuccessful asylum claimants; â¢ What are the contractual arrangements for the construction and the ongoing staffing of the

 offshore camps; â¢ How do the conditions at the offshore camps compare to Australian detention centres, including access to health, education, and interpreters; â¢ What is the impact of the ongoing use of defence personnel to apprehend and detain asylum

 seekers; â¢ Events surrounding the apprehending of the various boats since the arrival of The Tampa, including allegations of boats being set on fire and children being thrown into the water; â¢ What the impacts of the recently passed package of Migration Bills will be on all refugees,

 including offshore and onshore refugees and those who have already been granted refugee status in Australia.

 “This is by no means a full list, but it highlights some of the many areas where there are questions to be answered.

 “I am very keen to ensure maximum community input into an inquiry and enable a comprehensive examination of this crucial area of public policy.

 “With the election concluded it should now be possible to examine this crucial and ongoing issue in a more measured and comprehensive way to see how effective the current policy is,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
