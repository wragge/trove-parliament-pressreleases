 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison 

 â¢ Coalition calls for inquiry into missing 

 asylum seekers   10/05/10  

 The Coalition has called on the Rudd Government to conduct a full inquiry into the  disappearance of five asylum seekers, after an extensive search failed to locate them,  Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan and  Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today. 

 Mr Keenan said: “The disappearance is a tragedy and needs to be thoroughly  investigated. This is a tragic end to what appears to be an attempt to illegally enter  Australia. 

 “We have requested a full briefing from the Government on the details of this  tragedy,” he said. 

 “A full inquiry is needed to determine how it occurred, and what needs to be done to  prevent it from happening again. 

 “This tragedy is a stark reminder of the dangers facing people who attempt to come to  Australia illegally by boat and why the Australian Government must do everything  within its power to stop the boats from coming,” he said. 

 Mr Morrison said: “There is nothing humane about policies that influence a person’s  decision to risk their life on a boat to illegally enter Australia. 

 “Under the Rudd Government 120 boats have turned up, carrying almost 5,500  people. Fourteen boats have arrived carrying 554 people since Kevin Rudd  implemented his ineffective and discriminatory policy to freeze asylum applications 

 for Sri Lankans and Afghans,” he said. 

 “This represents more people than the total capacity of the Northern Detention Centre  in Darwin that is now almost full. 

 “The Coalition will take real action to stop the boats,” he said.
