 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling Another boat almost reaches mainland as  30,000 people have now arrived since last  election  April 15, 2013

 The latest two illegal boats arrivals make it 30,000 people to arrive in Australia by boat since Julia Gillard promised to  squash the people smuggling trade at the last election, Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and  Shadow Minister for Justice Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “Once again the farce that is Labor’s border protection policies has been exposed with another illegal boat arrival, carrying  72 passengers, making it nearly all the way to Broome undetected.

 “Not only did this vessel almost reach the Australian mainland but the West Australian Police were called on to assist in  the interception - another clear indication of just how overstretched our Border Protection Command is in trying to deal  with Labor’s dismal mismanagement of our borders.

 “This is yet another embarrassment for the Government in a week that has already seen an asylum boat make it all the  way to Geraldton undetected and another vessel arrive in Flying Fish Cove on Christmas Island undetected.

 “Despite this being the second boat in under a week to almost reach the mainland of WA, Labor is still yet to pass its  legislation to excise the Australian mainland from the migration zone - meaning all illegal boat arrivals that reach the  mainland are therefore unable to be processed offshore.

 “The last election Julia Gillard said she would stop the boats from coming yet she has since presided over the single  greatest amount of illegal boat arrivals under any Australian Prime Minister.

 “On September 14 the Australian people will have the opportunity to judge this Government on their failure to protect  Australia’s borders,” Mr Keenan said.
