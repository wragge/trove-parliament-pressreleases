 Laurie Ferguson MP 

 Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement  Services 

 Mother Fish giving voice to Australian stories  29 April 2010 

 Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services, Laurie  Ferguson, today paid tribute to Vietnamese-Australian filmmaker Khoa Do on the  35th anniversary of Vietnamese settlement in Australia, which coincided with the  world premiere of Do's new film, Mother Fish.  

 The film, screening at Riverside Theatres in Parramatta, is about four refugees who  fled Vietnam in 1980 and is Australia's first feature film with an all-Vietnamese cast in  title roles. 

 Khoa Do was named Young Australian of the Year in 2005 and is already the  director and writer of two previous highly acclaimed films, The Finished People  (2003) and Footy Legends (2006). 

 'I was pleased to attend a showing at Parliament House of Footy Legends, which  focused on the Yagoona area adjacent to my electorate,' Mr Ferguson said. 

 'Mother Fish adds to the rich and diverse tapestry of Australian stories, of which we  are all a part. According to the 2006 Census, nearly 160 000 Australians recorded  their birthplace as Vietnam. About 75 per cent of them arrived between 1975 and  1990 as refugees. 

 'The 2006 Census also recorded nearly 50 000 people born in Australia who  identified their ancestry as Vietnamese. 

 'Thirty-five years on, Vietnamese Australians are very much an important part of  Australian society. 

 'Those who arrived from Vietnam worked hard and provided opportunities for their  children born in Australia. 

 'Vietnamese Australians are today well represented in universities and many highly  skilled professions. 

 'In 2007, former refugee Hieu Van Le rose to occupy one of the highest public offices  in Australia, Lieutenant Governor of South Australia. 

 'I offer my congratulations to Khoa Do on the world premiere of Mother Fish.'
