 Senator Evans in Singapore

 The following is a transcript of a briefing given to Australian news media representatives by Senator Evans in Singapore on 27 July:

 SENATOR EVANS: WELL YOU'VE GOT THE TEXT OF THE TWO STATEMENTS, FIRST FROM SECRETARY OF STATE CHRISTOPHER, SECONDLY THE JOINT STATEMENT FROM ROBERT RAY (MINISTER FOR DEFENCE) AND MYSELF WHICH IS BEING

 RELEASED IN CANBERRA MORE OR LESS AS WE SPEAK. SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER ASKED TO SEE ME AS MATTER OF SOME URGENCY AND HE CALLED UPON ME IN MY SUITE UP HERE JUST TWO -OR THREE HOURS AGO TO SAY THAT HE DEEPLY

 REGRETTED THAT EVENTS HAD CAUSED HIM TO CHANGE HIS TRAVEL PLANS TO FLY BACK URGENTLY TO WASHINGTON FOR TALKS WITH THE PRESIDENT, AND THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WAS JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED WITH THE SCHEDULED AUSMIN MEETING. HE FULLY EXPLAINED TO ME THE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR ABORTING THE VISIT. THEY'RE SKETCHED IN HIS OWN

 PRESS RELEASE. THEY REFER PRIMARILY TO THE CURRENT, OBVIOUSLY VERY FRAUGHT EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT FOR HIS IMMINENT TRIP TO THE MIDDLE EAST. I THINK THERE ARE ALSO ONE OR TWO OTHER THINGS ON THE BOIL WHICH ARE ALSO HINTED AT IN HIS STATEMENT BUT ABOUT WHICH IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO BE MORE EXPLICIT AT THIS STAGE. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THERE WAS REALLY NO CHOICE OF COURSE BUT TO AGREE THAT THIS WAS A MATTER OF UNHAPPY NECESSITY. WE SPENT THE REST OF OUR CONVERSATION DISCUSSING HOW WE COULD PUT THE

 PIECES TOGETHER IN TERMS OF THE AUSMIN MEETING, AND WE HAVE AGREED ... /Z

 FIRST

 cQMMONW LTH PARLIAMENTARY LISRARyMICAH

 THAT IT WILL BE NOT CANCELLED BUT DEFERRED AND THAT IT WILL BE PICKED

 UP AGAIN IN THE FIRST PART OF NEXT YEAR. I CAN'T BE PRECISE ABOUT DATES AT THIS STAGE. OBVIOUSLY EVERYTHING HAS BEEN HAPPENING ON THE RUN. BUT THE INTENTION WOULD BE FOR IT TO OCCUR IN AUSTRALIA IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF NEXT YEAR. IN THE MEANTIME DEFENCE OFFICIALS' TALKS WILL GO AHEAD PRETTY MUCH AS PLANNED. THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE

 PACIFIC, ADMIRAL LARSON, IS IN FACT IN AUSTRALIA AT THE MOMENT FOR THOSE TALKS. US UNDER SECRETARY FOR DEFENCE POLICY, FRANK WISNER, IS IN SINGAPORE AT THE MOMENT. HE WILL FLY DOWN AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED TO CAIRNS AND HE AND ADMIRAL LARSON WILL HAVE TALKS WITH THEIR AUSTRALIAN COUNTERPARTS PRETTY WELL AS SCHEDULED. QUITE APART FROM THOSE TALKS, THE POLITICAL DIALOGUE BETWEEN OURSELVES AND THE US WILL

 CONTINUE, IN FACT AT QUITE AN ACCELERATED PACE, OVER THE MONTHS AHEAD. WE HAVE IN SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER'S STATEMENT THE FIRST OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION OF SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE LONG BEEN SPECULATING ABOUT, BUT HERE IT IS, THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WILL BE MAKING A BILATERAL VISIT TO THE US IN SEPTEMBER, AS WELL AS OF COURSE THE EXPECTED MEETING WITH MR CLINTON AND OTHER ASIA/PACIFIC LEADERS IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE APEC MEETING IN NOVEMBER. I'LL ALSO BE HAVING A SEPARATE ROUND OF FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH WARREN CHRISTOPHER MYSELF IN THE US IN NOVEMBER. SO  I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD SUGGEST FOR A MOMENT THAT ANY OF THIS REPRESENTS A DOWNGRADING OR AN UNDERPLAYING OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE US/AUSTRALIA RELATIONSHIP. YOU'LL NOTICE THAT SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER HAS GONE OUT OF HIS WAY IN HIS STATEMENT TO EMPHASISE THAT THE US/AUSTRALIA RELATIOtNSHIP IS SEEN IN WASHINGTON AS ONE OF THE REAL LINCHPINS OF US FOREIGN POLICY AND US RELATIONS IN â¢ THIS PART OF THE WORLD. MIGHT I SAY THAT SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER WAS

 ALSO PERSONALLY VERY GENEROUS IN HIS PRAISE FOR NOT ONLY THE STATE OF THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP BUT THE PARTICULAR CONTRIBUTION THAT HE SAW AUSTRALIA WAS MAKING TO CURRENT POLICY DEVELOPMENTS, PARTICULARLY

 IN THE REGION. AND I THINK THAT SOME OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS WEEK HERE IN SINGAPORE ARE EXPLICIT TESTIMONY TO THAT. AND THAT WAS AGAIN EXPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGED BY WARREN CHRISTOPHER AND ALSO WINSTON LORD WITH WHOM I'VE ALSO BEEN TALKING IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES. SO THAT'S AS MUCH AS I CAN REALLY SAY ABOUT ALL THAT. IT'S REGRETTABLE,

 BUT THESE THINGS HAPPEN IN THE ROUGH AND TUMBLE OF INTERNATIONAL â¢ AFFAIRS AND I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD IN THAT CONTEXT.

 â¢ Q. ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE SYMBOLISM OF THE CANCELLATION THOUGH GIVEN THAT SOME OTHER AREAS, SAY TRADE PARTICULARLY, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE UNITED STATES?

 A. IT'S NOT A CANCELLATION, IT'S A DEFERRAL. IT'S BEEN A DEFERRAL FOR EXCELLENT REASONS WHICH ARE LARGELY SELF-EVIDENT ON THEIR FACE. THE CONTENT OF THE DISCUSSIONS DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING ABOUT IT WHICH WAS OF A HIGH DEGREE OF CURRENT URGENCY, AND CERTAINLY IT WAS NOT

 INTENDED THAT THERE BE ANY TRADE ISSUES ON THE AGENDA. IT'S ESSENTIALLY A DIALOGUE ABOUT POLITICAL AND SECURITY ISSUES, WITH A

 FIRST

 .../3

 3-O.SI1606

 STRONG DEFENCE COMPONENT AS WELL AS A STRONG FOREIGN POLICY COMPONENT. SO  IN ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES, I DON'T THINK ANY PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE SHOULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO THIS DEFERRAL, SYMBOLICALLY OR OTHERWISE. IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT HAPPEN.

 Q. DOES IT UNDERLINE THOUGH, THE WAY THAT SECURITY HAS BEEN SLIPPING DOWN THE SCALE, THAT IT'S NOT QUITE UP THERE WHERE IT WAS IN TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP?

 A. I WOULDN'T SAY THAT. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS OF COURSE THAT WE'RE L00K!NG AT SECURITY ISSUES IN A QUITE DIFFERENT LIGHT FROM THE WAY IN WHICH WE WERE LOOKING AT THEM AS RECENTLY AS TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO. THE COLD 'WAR IS OVER AND ALTHOUGH THESE BILATERAL ALLIANCE

 RELATIONSHIPS STILL REMAIN VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF THE TOTAL SECURITY : PICTURE IN THE ASIA/PACIFIC REGION, THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ELEMENT IN THE PICTURE. WE'VE BEEN VERY ACTIVELY PROMOTING THE IDEA OF SECURITY AS BEST GUARANTEED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF THOSE ALLIANCE RELATIONSHIPS AND A MULTILATERAL WEB OF ADDITIONAL DIALOGUE AND COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIPS. AND OF COURSE THAT' 5 ONE OF THE

 CENTRAL THEMES TO COME THROUGH IN THIS VERY ASEAN PMC CONFERENCE THAT

 WE'RE HERE IN SINGAPORE TO TALK ABOUT. SO  THERE IS INEVITABLY SOME CHANGE IN THE CHARACTER OF THIS PARTICULAR MEETING AND THAT IS, I GUESS, GOING TO GO ON BEING THE CASE . IN THE YEARS AHEAD AS THE CHARACTER OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHANGES WITH THE CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT I DON'T SEE IT AS A DOWNGRADING IN ANY

 WAY. I THINK THAT'S A QUITE INAPPROPRLATE WAY OF LOOKING AT THE STATE OF THE ALLIANCE. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF THAT ALLIANCE WORKING ITSELF OUT IN A DIFFERENT WAY. -

 Q. SENATOR HOW CAN IT BE A DEFERRAL IF ANNUAL TALKS ARE LEFT UNTIL NEXT YEAR? DOES THAT MEAN THAT THERE'LL BE ANOTHER ANNUAL TALKS IN THE LATTER HALF OF NEXT YEAR AS WELL AS THESE ANNUAL TALKS IN THE FIRST HALF?

 A. WELL IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THERE WILL BE A SECOND ROUND OF TALKS NEXT YEAR AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT I DID DISCUSS WITH SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER. THERE'S AT LEAST TWO OTHER MAJOR OCCASIONS NEXT YEAR WHEN HE WILL BE IN THISREGION: NEXT YEAR'S ASEAN PMC, NEXT YEAR'S

 APED MEETING WHICH WILL BE HELD IN INDONESIA. AND ONE OPTION WAS TO THINK IN TERMS OF A FURTHER ROUND OF TALKS BEING PLANNED IN THAT CONTEXT. BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY OUR DESIRE, BOTH OF US, TO GET ON THE AGENDA AGAIN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THIS YEAR'S TALKS. AND WE ARE IN FACT HOPING THAT THEY MIGHT BE HELD AS EARLY AS JANUARY. IT IS JUST

 IMPOSSIBLE AT THIS STAGE WHEN EVERYTHING IS HAPPENING ALL AROUND BOTH OF US TO BED THAT DOWN HERE AND NOW.

 Q.  SENATOR COULD YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE CONTENTS OF THE CONVERSATION WITH CHRISTOPHER, ABOUT WHAT CAUSED THE URGENCY OF .../4

 FIRST

 HIS RETURN?

 A. NO, I THINK THAT HAS TO SE LEFT TO SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER TO EXPLAIN. HIS OWN WORDS ARE, ESSENTIALLY: THAT THE DRAMATIC ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE IN SOUTHERN LEBANON AND NORTHERN ISRAEL IS

 SOMETHING THAT IS VIEWED WITH GREAT CONCERN, NOT LEAST IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE PEACE PROCESS; THAT HE WAS PLANNING AS WE ALL KNOW TO VISIT THE MIDDLE EAST NEXT WEEK, BUT IN THE CHANGED AND RATHER MORE FRAGILE CONTEXT THAT NOW EXISTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, HE FELT THE NEED, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE PRESIDENT, TO HAVE SOME DETAILED DISCUSSIONS IN WASHINGTON BEFORE THAT VISIT PROCEEDED. HIS STATEMENT ALSO MAKES REFERENCE TO THE NEED TO CONFER ON OTHER ISSUES.

 I'M UNABLE TO GIVE FURTHER CONTENT TO THAT.

 Q. DID SAY HE WAS GOING TO THE MID-EAST AFTER HE RETURNS TO WASHINGTON?

 A. YES HE DID. THE INTENTION IS THAT HE'LL PROCEED WITH THE MID-EAST TRIP, BUT RATHER THAN AS WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED GOING THERE AFTER THE EXCURSION TO AUSTRALIA. THIS CHANGED ENVIRONMENT, OF WHICH WE'VE JUST SPOKEN, REQUIRES HIM, AND HIS JUDGEMENT AND THE

 PRESIDENT'S JUDGEMENT, TO HAVE A FURTHER ROUND OF DISCUSSIONS IN THE US FIRST.

 Q. WHAT OTHER THINGS ARE MORE IMPORTANT?

 A. WELL I'M JUST REFERRING YOU TO THE OPENING BARS OF MR CHRISTOPHER'S ANNOUNCEMENT IN WHICH HE SAYS "TO DISCUSS RECENT EVENTS IN THAT REGION, I.E. THE MIDDLE-EAST, AND TO CONFER ON OTHER ISSUES". OKAY, I'M JUST DRAWING YOUR ATTENTION TO THAT PHRASE. NOW I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT, THAT'S A MATTER FOR MR CHRISTOPHER TO SPELL OUT. BUT THERE ARE ONE OR TWO OTHER THINGS THAT HE NEEDS CONFER ABOUT. THAT'S ALL I CAN REALLY SAY ABOUT THIS STUFF. UNLESS THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE. THEN WELL GO BACK TO ASEAN RIGHT NOW. I

 MEAN IT ALL SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. IT'S REGRETTABLE BUT THAT'S LIFE. NOW ASEAN.

 Q. DO YOU THINK THAT THE PROPOSED "EXPANDED-EXPANDED PERM FIVE" MEETING IS A GOOD IDEA.

 A. WELL I JUST WOULDN'T INVEST TOO MUCH SIGNIFICANCE IN IT. THERE ARE MEETINGS TAKING PLACE ALL THE TIME AMONG THE CORE GROUP AMBASSADORS WITH THE VIETNAMESE OFTEN INVOLVED, SOMETIMES NOT. YOU ONLY HAVE SORT OF WHIZBANG, BELLS AND WHISTLES MEETINGS POSSIBLY INVOLVING MINISTERS OR HOME-BASED OFFICIALS DR SOMETHING WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOME MAJOR POLICY ISSUE TO RESOLVE. AND AT THE MOMENT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT I THINK A CONSENSUS IS EMERGING ABOUT HOW TO APPROACH THESE ISSUES WITHOUT THERE BEING ANY GREAT NECESSITY FOR SOME HIGH

 ..,/5

 FIRST

 PROFILE, BIG MEETING. THERE DOES NEED TO BE OBVIOUSLY A MAJOR

 MEETING ON THE REHABILITATION EXERCISE, BUT THAT'S IN TRAIN ANYWAY, THE ICORC MEETING FOR SEPTEMBER, I THINK, IN ORDER TO MOBILISE AGAIN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR THAT MAJOR ASSISTANCE EFFORT. BUT IN TERMS OF THE POLICY ISSUES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE, I DON'T THINK THERE IS QUITE THE SAME COMPELLING NECESSITY. I'M NOT SAYING IT IS A

 BAD IDEA, I'M JUST SAYING THAT I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S AN IDEA THAT NEEDS RIGHT NOW TO BE PUT INTO SUBSTANTIVE EFFECT IN ANY MAJOR WAY.

 Q. WHAT ROLE IS THERE FOR AUSTRALIANS IN TERMS OF PEOPLE ON THE GROUND IN THE ONGOING PRESENCE?

 A. WELL I THINK NOT EXTENSIVE. I MEAN WE ARE ONLY TALKING ABOUT A

 QUITE SMALL INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE, A RELATIVE HANDFUL OF PEOPLE PLAYING T^fESE SORT OF ROLES. THERE MAY BE A CASE WHERE ONE OR TWO

 MILITARY ADVISERS, THERE MAY BE A CASE FOR ONE OR TWO, SEVERAL PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE COORDINATION OF THE AID FUNCTION OTHER FROM THE VARIOUS AGENCIES THEMSELVES. BUT I WOULDN'T WANT TO, SPECULATE ABOUT THAT. I MEAN THERE WILL BE A LOT OF INVOLVEMENT IN TERMS OF THE

 REHABILITATION, THE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. ROBERT RAY HAS FLAGGED THE POSSIBILITY OF DEFENCE COOPERATION PROGRAM BEING APPLIED IN RELATIVELY MODEST WAYS TO HELP WITH THE REBUILDING OF THE NATIONAL ARMY AND SO ON. BUT NONE OF THESE THINGS I WOULD EXPECT WOULD

 INVOLVE ANY KIND OF MAJOR AUSTRALIAN PRESENCE ON THE GROUND.

 Q: WHAT DID YOU DISCUSS THIS MORNING? BURMA, BOSNIA, ECONOMIC ISSUES.

 A:  I OPENED UP THE DISCUSSION ON BURMA AND IN ESSENCE I SAID THAT IT WOULD BE MOST UNHAPPY IF THIS OCCASION WERE TO PASS WITHOUT SOME â¢ RECOGNITION OF THE CONTINUING VERY SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT DO EXIST IN BURMA WHICH I GUESS ARE THREEFOLD. ONE, THE CONTINUING DETENTION OF

 LARGE NUMBERS OF EFFECTIVELY POLITICAL PRISONERS AND DETAINEES INCLUDING DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI; THE CONTINUING ATMOSPHERE OF HUMAN RIGHTS REPRESSION THAT EXIST IN THE COUNTRY NOTWITHSTANDING SOME LOOSENING IN SOME WAYS OF THAT ENVIRONMENT OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR SO. THE SECOND PROBLEM IS THE CONSPICUOUS LACK OF ANY KIND OF DISCERNIBLE AND CREDIBLE PROGRESS IN THE CONSTITUTION CONVENTION

 NEGOTIATIONS. ANY EXPECTATIONS WE MIGHT HAVE HAD. IN THAT RESPECT HAVE BEEN RATHER DASHED, NOT ONLY BY THE TIME IT HAS TAKEN FOR NOTHING VERY MUCH TO HAPPEN, BUT ALSO THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION THAT HAS BEEN CIRCULATED RECENTLY BY THE MILITARY WHICH MAKES CLEAR, THAT NO FORM OF DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY WHATSOEVER IS CONTEMPLATED FOR THE

 MILITARY. THE THIRD ISSUE IS OBVIOUSLY THE ROHINGYA OF REFUGEES AND THE INTERNATIONAL CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. AND I SAID THE HARD PART IS NOT TO DISCERN WHAT IS GOING WRONG BUT HOW TO TRY AND

 MOVE THE SITUATION FORWARD. AND I EXAMINED VARIOUS OPTIONS AND POSSIBILITIES AND SAID THAT REALISTICALLY WE HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ...16

 FIRST

 THE ONLY 

 REAL LEVERAGE THAT COULD BE EXERTED IN THE PRESENT SITUATION WAS FROM THE ASEAN COUNTRIES AND FROM CHINA. AND WE HOPE THAT THE ASEAN COUNTRIES WOULD CONTINUE TO DO WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING WITH INCREASING COMMITMENT, I =THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT IN RECENT

 MONTHS, AND THAT IS TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR TO THE BURMESE THAT THEY CAN'T EXPECT TO MOVE THEIR OWN AGENDA FORWARD IN TERMS OF CLOSER RELATIONS WITH ASEAN, ULTIMATE MEMBERSHIP OF ASEAN, UNLESS AND UNTIL SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IS MADE ON THE DEMOCRATISATION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS FRONT. NOW IF YOU WANT THE DETAIL THAT GOES WITH ALL OF THAT I DON'T PARTICULARLY WANT TO GO INTO...

 Q: WAS THERE ANY SUGGESTION OF SANCTIONS?

 A: I SAID THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN FORCED TO ACCEPT THE REALITY THAT THERE SIMPLY WASN'T THE DEGREE OF INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR SANCTIONS THAT WOULD MAKE THEM MEANINGFUL IN PRACTICE AND THAT IN ANY EVENT THE ISOLATIONIST DISPOSITION OF THE REGIME, AND THE GENERATION THAT THEY HAD BEEN LIVING WAS IMMUNISED FROM SIGNIFICANT CONTACT WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD, MEANT THAT SANCTIONS WERE, EVEN IF FULLY EFFECTIVE, WERE NOT LIKELY TO BE VERY USEFUL IN ACTUALLY POSING ANY REAL PRESSURES. EQUALLY I THINK WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SIMPLE CALLS NOT ONLY FOR THE RELEASE FOR DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI WHICH OF COURSE WE ARE ALL CALLING FOR, BUT HER--IMMEDIATE ELEVATION TO THE HEAD OF SOME GOVERNMENT WAS SIMPLY UNREALISTIC. AND THEN YOU'VE GOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IN ANY EVENT THAT THE ELECTION BACK IN 1990

 WAS FOR A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY RATHER THAN FOR A GOVERNMENT. BUT THAT'S NEVER BEEN PART OF AUSTRALIA'S REPERTOIRE ANYWAY. BUT THERE ARE OBVIOUS LIMITATIONS THAT WE CAN SEE IN WHAT THE INTERNATIONAL

 COMMUNITY CAN D0. THE REAL STRENGTH IS AROUND THE TABLE DOWNSTAIRS.

 Q: IS SATISFACTION FROM THE DIALOGUE PARTNERS WHAT ASEAN IS LOOKING AT?

 â¢ A: NO I HAVE TO SAY THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE IS THAT

 â¢ ASEAN IS TAKING THE PROBLEM MUCH MORE SERIOUSLY. I DON'T WANT TO SINGLE OUT INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES BUT THE TENOR OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DEBATE THIS MORNING WAS VERY HEARTENING AND CERTAINLY THE PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS I'VE WAD WITH AT LEAST THREE NOW OF MY ASEAN COUNTERPARTS HAVE GIVEN ME CONSIDERABLE HEART: THAT THEY REALLY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE SITUATION, REGARD THE BURMESE AS QUITE OUT OF STEP WITH TRENDS THAT ARE OCCURRING IN THE REGION, ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DESTABILISING IMPACT OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND GENERALLY VERY MUCH WANT THEM TO MOVE DOWN A MORE ACCOMMODATING PATH.

 Q. WHILE THEY THINK THAT, THEY HAVEN'T SAID OR DONE ANYTHING TO INDICATE TO THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT THAT'S THEIR ATTITUDE.

 A: WELL THEY'VE DONE A FAIR AMOUNT IN THE COURSE OF THIS PARTICULAR

 FIRST

 CONFERENCE. 

 WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO SAY PUBLICLY IS UP TO THE ASEANS. WHAT THEY'RE SAYING TO THEIR DIALOGUE PARTNERS IS VERY MUCHMORE PRECISE, VERY MUCH MORE SUBSTANTIAL, THAN HAS BEEN THE CASE IN THE PAST. I NOTED LAST YEAR THE BEGINNINGS OF A MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION IN TERMS OF THE FAIR AMOUNT OF INDIFFERENCE OF PREVIOUS YEARS IF I CAN POLITELY SO DESCRIBE IT. LAST YEAR THERE WERE ALREADY SIGNS THAT PEOPLE WERE BEGINNING TO TAKE THE ISSUE QUITE SERIOUSLY. THIS YEAR I'VE HAD THE STRONG IMPRESSION, AS ALL THE OTHER DIALOGUE PARTNERS DID, THAT IT WAS AN ISSUE BEING TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY INDEED. REPORTS COMING OUT OF THE AMM ARE THAT THEY HAVE HAD BARNSTORMING SESSIONS ON THIS, YOU KNOW THEY'VE MADE A DECLARATION ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS, WE'VE JUST ALL BEEN TO VIENNA AND SUBSCRIBED TO THE DECLARATION OF THE VIENNA CONFERENCE MAKING CLEAR THAT CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS WERE

 INDIVISIBLE WITH ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RIGHTS AND I THINK IT IS HEARTENING THAT THIS TREND IS BECOMING APPARENT.

 Q: BUT WHEN THEY TALKED ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE AMM, THEY DIDN'T MENTION BURMA?

 A: WELL THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE MENTIONED IT PUBLICLY BUT THEY CERTAINLY MENTIONED IT AMONG THEMSELVES. IT WAS A SUBJECT OF QUITE A LOT OF SIGNIFICANT DISCUSSION AND THE SUBJECT OF QUITE A LOT OF DISCUSSION

 AROUND THE TABLE THIS MORNING. IT'S BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A LOT OF DISCUSSION IN BILATERALS. NOW IT IS A MATTER OF STYLE, CULTURE, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS APPROACH: HOW MUCH YOU CHOOSE TO DO ON THE PUBLIC RECORD AND HOW MUCH YOU CHOOSE TO Da PRIVATELY. WESTERN COUNTRIES HAVE A BIT OF A DISPOSITION TO DO FAR MORE IN PUBLIC BUT I â¢ WOULDN'T WISH IT TO BE THOUGHT TI-rAT THERE'S NOTHING AT ALL HAPPENING

 ON THE ASEAN FRONT. I REPEAT IT WAS HEARTENING.

 â¢ Q: YOU MENTIONED THE EVENTUAL ENTRY OF BURMA INTO ASEAN. HAD SLORC

 ACTUALLY MADE ANY NOISES ABOUT THAT IN ITSELF?

 A: I'M NOT SURE-WHAT PUBLIC NOISES THEY'VE MADE BUT THEY'VE MADE IT VERY CLEAR OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THAT THEY WOULD VERY MUCH HAVE WELCOMED AN INVITATION TO A KIND OF OBSERVER STATUS, BALI TREATY STATUS, IN .RELATION TO THE ASEAN MINISTERIAL MEETING THAT, FOR

 EXAMPLE VIETNAM AND LAOS NOW ENJOY. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

 Q : DID ANYTHING ELSE COME UP THIS MORNING THAT WAS OF INTEREST?

 A: WELL THERE WAS A LOT THAT WAS OF INTEREST. BOSNIA WAS OF INTEREST BUT I MEAN NOT IN TERMS OF SHAPES, SUBSTANTIVE OUTCOMES. I MEAN A LOT OF CRIES OF PAIN FROM VARIOUS SOURCES AND A LOT OF EXPLANATIONS FROM THE EUROPEANS...

 Q: DID YOU CLARIFY WITH MALAYSIAN WHAT EAEC IS GOING TO BE, WHETHER .../8

 FIRST

 WE'RE GOING TO BE INVITED TO JOIN?

 A: NO. I HAVEN'T CLARIFIED FROM ANYONE WHAT THE NATURE OF EAEC I5 GOING TO BE AND WHAT THE-PRECISE PROCESSES AND STRUCTURES ARE THAT ARE GOING TO EVOLVE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT NOBODY YET KNOWS. IT'S IN PROCESS OF EVOLUTION. IT'S BEEN A RECURRING THEME IN MY TALKS AND OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE'S ENGAGED IN THESE SORT OF EXPLORATORY DISCUSSIONS AT THE MOMENT. BUT WHAT IT IS IS GOING TO TAKE SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME TO LEARN.

 Q : YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN CHRISTOPHER'S REMARKS ABOUT BEING PUZZLED BY EAEC?

 A: WELL I'D USE MY OWN LANGUAGE. MY  APPROACH IS NOT DISSIMILAR BUT I'M NOT PUZZLED, I'M JUST NOTING THAT IT'S NOT JUST YET REFINED OR FORMULATED AND I WOULD DOUBT VERY MUCH THAT IT WILL BE VERY MUCH FURTHER ADVANCED THIS YEAR.

 Q : (INAUDIBLE)

 A: NO NOT A REPORT AS SUCH BUT THERE WAS A SINGAPOREAN CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEBATE WHICH WAS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THAT.

 Q: WHAT WAS THE CRITICAL THING ON ECONOMIC ISSUES TODAY?

 A: I THINK AS YOU WOULD EXPECT, PRETTY STRONG REAFFIRMATION OF OUR DESIRE THAT THE URUGUAY ROUND BE COMPLETED THIS YEAR. A PRETTY TOUGH ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE QUADS IN JULY, NOT ONLY FROM ME BUT FROM ALL THE CAIRNS GROUP COUNTRIES: PRASONG HAD SOME THINGS TO SAY IN OPENING THE

 DEBATE, ALI ALATAS DID AND DON MCKINNON DID; ALL OF US MAKING THE POINT THAT WHILE THE QUAD'S NEGOTIATIONS ANNOUNCEMENT ON 7 JULY HAD CERTAINLY MOVED THE GAME FORWARD AND GIVEN A KICK START AGAIN TO THE NEGOTIATIONS, IT HAD STILL LEFT UNRESOLVED SOME KEY FEATURES IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR, INCLUDING NON-FERROUS STUFF THAT A LOT OF COUNTRIES ARE VERY INTERESTED IN. IT HADN'T REALLY TOUCHED IN ANY SUBSTANTIVE WAY THE SERVICES ISSUE AND OF COURSE IT HADN'T MOVED THE GAME FORWARD ON AGRICULTURE AT.ALL. THERE'S STILL AN AWFUL AMOUNT YET TO BE DONE TO BED DOWN BLAIR HOUSE, TO EXTEND BLAIR HOUSE ACCEPTABILITY TO EVERY OTHER NATION AND ALSO TO GET MARKET ACCESS PACKAGES PUT TOGETHER. SO THERE WAS A SUGGESTION THAT THE MILDLY SELF-CONGRATULATORY AIR FROM SOME OF THE QUAD STATEMENTS MIGHT NEED TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY SOME MORE SUBSTANCE IN THE RUN HOME AND THAT IT WASN'T JUST A MATTER OF EVERYONE CATCHING UP WITH THE QUADS, THAT THE QUADS THEMSELVES HAD A FAIR BIT MORE TO DO. SO I MEAN THERE WAS A SHARP, SHARP MESSAGE DELIVERED THAT PEOPLE WANTED THAT ROUND TO COME HOME AND BELIEVED IT WAS POSSIBLE BUT A BIG JOB REMAINED TO BE DONE AND IT WAS UP TO EVERYBODY TO WORK TOGETHER TO DO IT.

 Q: ... AND YOUR GOING TO CLOSE THE MEETING TOMORROW. HAVE YOU DONE EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE?

 A: I THINK THE PLENARY SESSIONS HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL. THEY HAVE

 BEEN SUPPLEMENTED BY SOME PRETTY EFFECTIVE DISCUSSION NOT ONLY IN THE FAMOUS INFORMAL DINNER THE OTHER NIGHT BUT ALSO IN AN HOUR AROUND THE

 TABLE WITH GOH CHOK TONG. THERE'S BEEN A REMARKABLE SHARPNESS OF FOCUS ON A LOT OF ISSUES THAT WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE 6+1 TONIGHT AND TOMORROW.
