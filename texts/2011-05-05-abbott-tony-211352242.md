 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH   

 5 May 2011   

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR,  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW,   LAUNCESTON 

 

 Subjects: Julia Gillard’s carbon tax; border protection; welfare; budget.   

 E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It’s great to be here at Agfest, this is an iconic show. It’s one of the very biggest agricultural displays in  Australia. It’s obviously a real magnet for people here in northern Tasmania and it’s great to be here.   

 There’s a lot of concern about the carbon tax, a lot of concern about a Government which is not listening to  the people when it comes to the carbon tax. I think that it’s all very well for the Prime Minister to be  meeting people at Kirribilli House, but what about the people who didn’t get invitations to Kirribilli House?  They’re the people who want the Prime Minister to take her earmuffs off and listen to them.    

 We see today a whole range of manufacturing industries uniting to stop the carbon tax. We’ve got doctors  warning against the carbon tax. We had the Northern Territory parliament pass a resolution last night asking  for the Northern Territory to be exempted from the carbon tax. This is a toxic tax. It will do enormous  damage to Australia’s standard of living and it will do terrible damage to our jobs and to our international  competitiveness.    

 It’s not only here in Australia that people are turning against this carbon tax, but right around the world the  tide is going against what Julia Gillard is proposing. We’ve just seen an election in Canada which gave an  anti-carbon tax, anti-carbon price government a majority and that’s the first time they’ve had a majority  government in Canada for quite a long time.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, you’ve had the chance to walk around Agfest. What would you say people here have told you is  their number one concern about the tax?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, they don’t think we should make a difficult situation worse. We all know Australian exports have got  to compete on difficult world markets. We all know that there are a whole range of issues that exporters  have got to deal with, the high Aussie dollar obviously one of them. Now, there are lots of things we can’t  control but one thing we can control is the government charges that we hit people with here in Australia, and

 this carbon tax is just an unnecessary impost. It’s an economic own goal and people understand that and  that’s why they don’t want it. They look at the Prime Minister who can’t explain it, they look at the  Treasurer who can’t understand it, they look at the Tasmanian Premier and the Queensland Premier who  have reservations about it and they ask themselves ‘why should we support it; why are we doing this in  fact?’   

 QUESTION:   

 [Inaudible]   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, we have a clear and effective plan to deal with this whole question of emissions. We would spend  about a billion dollars a year from savings in the budget to plant more trees on suitable land, to get more  carbon into the soil and to use smart technology that can turn carbon dioxide from an unwanted waste  product into an input and we can produce biodiesel, stock feed and so on. That’s the smart way to deal with  climate change. The dumb way is to whack on a great big new tax that won’t clean up the environment but it  will clean out your wallet and it will wipe out jobs big time.   

 QUESTION:   

 What would a carbon tax mean for Tasmanian farmers?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, even though for the moment the Government does not want to impose the tax on agriculture, Ross  Garnaut has said that eventually agriculture must be in it. But in the meantime every farm uses electricity,  dairy farms in particular are very big users of electricity, irrigation farms are very big users of electricity and  every farm uses fuel. Diesel is a very big input to farm costs and you’ve got to transport your produce from  farm to market, and that obviously means a lot of fuel. So, the indirect costs of farming would go up very  significantly were this carbon tax to come in.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, in Tasmania there’s the forestry peace talks. Now, signatories to those talks are saying that  they’re in danger of collapse unless the federal and the state Governments put in money. Do you think that  the Federal Government should do that to stop the talks collapsing?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, I think that, you know, we obviously promised $20 million to help adjustment in the forestry industry  at the election. The Government belatedly matched that but has mismanaged spending, badly mismanaged  the spending of that money. Look, I want to see a sustainable forestry industry in Tasmania. Yes, that’s  going to mean a lot of plantation forestry but I’m afraid we are going to continue, we should continue with  some forestry in native forests and I just think it’s very important that we go ahead with the pulp mill. Yes,  it’s got to be the most environmentally friendly pulp mill but if we’re serious about economic development  in Tasmania we’ve got to have it. Even the state Labor government has finally been persuaded of the need  for the pulp mill but they’ve got to make it happen now. The state and federal Labor governments have got  to make it happen. If they don’t make it happen they’ve let down the people of Tasmania.   

 QUESTION:   

 [Inaudible] money in the order of hundreds of millions will be needed to stop the talks collapsing. Can the  Commonwealth afford that?

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well you know, it would be a lot easier for the Commonwealth to help if they hadn’t wasted so much money  on roof batts that catch fire, on overpriced school halls, on a National Broadband Network which - I mean,  everyone wants better broadband, we all want better broadband, but this is going to be a $50 billion plus  white elephant and all the billions that they’re spending on broadband is money which you can’t spend on  other worthy causes…   

 QUESTION:   

 If you were in government would you do what you had to do to stop the talks collapsing?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well I want as far as possible to see peace but I also want a sustainable, enduring forestry industry and a  peace which destroys the forestry industry is no peace worth having.   

 QUESTION:   

 Scott Morrison has said that Australia’s refugee intake should be based on their ability to get jobs, not on  their need as a refugee. Isn’t that a bit rough?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I think it’s very important that everyone who comes to Australia to live is a contributor and I think a lot of  Australians will be very concerned about the fact that some 60 per cent of people who are admitted as  refugees are still on welfare five years later. Now, I understand that a lot of people who come in are a bit  traumatised, but there’s no better country than Australia for people getting over that and I just think it is very  disappointing we don’t have higher employment rates amongst recent refugees.   

 QUESTION:   

 But doesn’t this policy, isn’t it contrary to Australia’s obligations under human rights law?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I think it’s very important that we encourage people who can work to work. I think it’s very disappointing  that people living in Australia who might work aren’t working, and if the Government is serious about  economic reform, if it’s serious about boosting productivity and participation there will be tough policies in  this budget to ensure that people who can work do work. We can’t keep people on welfare if they could  work and that’s what the Government should be doing.   

 QUESTION:    

 [Inaudible]   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 As I said, I’m all in favour of tough policies to try to get people of welfare and into work. The problem with  this one though is that we all know it’s very hard to get childcare and unless this is matched with a serious  effort to boost childcare, I just don’t think it’s going to work and what we’ve seen in the pre-budget  speculation is a lot of talk about cutting childcare, so it seems that yet again this Government is sending a  very muddled message about the budget.

 QUESTION:    

 Aren’t you sending your own muddled message then because you just said on the one hand refugees should  work [inaudible], it is very difficult for them to work even if they’re forced too. Maybe refugees are facing  similar issues.    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, the point is that the Government has got to make it more encouraging for people to work. We need  carrots and sticks to ensure that people who can work, do work. But I just state the obvious that if a mother  of a very young child has no access to childcare it’s very difficult to expect them to go out to work.   

 QUESTION:    

 On the budget, Deloitte Economics says that the surplus next year, sorry the deficit next year will be $51  billion, $10 billion more than forecast. What are your thoughts on that?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, we have the best terms of trade in Australia’s history and the fact that we are so deeply in debt and  deficit despite these historically high terms of trade really is a sign that you just can’t trust this Government  with money and when it comes to the budget, if the budget does not include the details of the carbon tax it  won’t be worth the paper that it’s printed on. This carbon tax is due to start in just 14 months and the idea  that you can have a credible budget without all the details of a carbon tax is just crackers. No responsible  government could bring down a budget now without including the details of this $11 billion a year plus tax.  If a company tried to float on the stock exchange with such a materially misleading and incomplete  document, the directors would be prosecuted and the company wouldn’t be allowed to list, and yet that is the  hole in the heart of this budget.    

 Finally, let me just say it’s great to have my colleagues here, Eric Abetz the Leader of the Opposition in the  Senate, Guy Barnett, Senator for Tasmania. It’s also good to be with Sam McQuestin today. Sam is one of  the local Liberal candidates for the state upper house and it’s a sign of our commitment to agriculture that so  many leading Liberals here today.    

 Thank you.
