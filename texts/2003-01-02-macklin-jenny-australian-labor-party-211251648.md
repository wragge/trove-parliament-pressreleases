 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - CANBERRA  THURSDAY 2 JANUARY 2003   

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects: Detention centre unrest 

 

 MACKLIN: All these acts of violence and the fires do put at risk the lives of people  who are living in the detention centres and also, of course, the people who are working  there. We do hope the police inquiry will be quick and that those found responsible will be  charged and be forced to take responsibility for their actions. But all that said, we do know  that this is not the first time there’s been problems in our detention centres and it’s time the  government actually recognised that change needs to happen in the way that people are  treated in the detention centres. First and foremost, people need to get decisions made  about whether or not they’re refugees done much more quickly. From Labor’s point of view  that should be done within 90 days. Get the decisions made quickly. People can then either  stay in Australia, if they are refugees, or be sent home.   

 JOURNALIST: Is it right to hold these men in Silverwater when they haven’t even been  charged?   

 MACKLIN:  The critical question is that we get the police inquiry underway as fast as  possible to find out who is responsible. Obviously, there must have been concerns about  security for them to have been moved.   

 JOURNALIST: Would you call for them to be charged quickly if they’re going to be  charged?   

 MACKLIN: We want the inquiry to happen as quickly as possible to find out who is  responsible so of course then they can be charged.   

 JOURNALIST:  Should Philip Ruddock end his holiday and come back?   

 MACKLIN: The critical question is really how do we deal with this problem now. The  police need to get the inquiry underway and make sure that the violence in the detention  centres stops. The other policy change that Labor is advocating is to get the management of 

 the detention centres out of the hands of private operators and back into the public sector.  We are concerned about the state of management in the detention centres.   

 JOURNALIST:  Doesn’t this point to the fundamental flaw of mandatory detention?   

 MACKLIN: No. We do think that mandatory detention is necessary, that people do  need to be checked for health and security purposes. But what’s clear is that these decisions  have to be made as quickly as possible so that people aren’t held for such long periods of  time; decisions about whether or not they are refugees or not can be made quickly. They  can then either stay in Australia if they are refugees or be sent home if they’re not.   

 JOURNALIST: What about those who claim persecution awaits them if they return to  Iran, Iraq or Afghanistan?   

 MACKLIN: If they are claiming that and they have been through the process of  assessment of refugee status that will come through in the process of them being  examined. But, of course, it is a question for the government. What is the government  doing with these people who have been found not to be refugees? Why is it that these  people are being held in Australia for such a long time? Why haven’t return arrangements  been organised.    

 JOURNALIST: That’s because they claim they’d be going back to persecution.   

 MACKLIN:  It’s a matter for the government to really explain whether or not that is  true. If these people haven’t been found to be refugees why haven’t they been sent home?  Why have they been held in detention for such a long period of time? 

 

 JOURNALIST: There have been reports that the government would consider putting  trade and aid pressure on other countries to hasten the deportation process. Is that  appropriate?   

 MACKLIN: Once again I’d say to the government why is it that they haven’t been  able to manage sending these people back to the countries from which they came much  more quickly. These are questions the government itself has to answer. We don’t know why  it is that these people are being held in detention for such a long time; why is it that they  are not being sent home. 

 

 JOURNALIST: But what do you think about of the idea of putting trade or aid pressure  on other countries to hasten the deportation?   

 MACKLIN: I would really say to the Government, if that is what is necessary, why can’t they  organise sending these people back to their own countries without resorting to those  measures?   

 JOURNALIST: If those countries didn’t cooperate would a Labor Government for instance  consider taking that measure?   

 MACKLIN: As far as we’re concerned we do want to see the decisions made as quickly as  possible about whether or not people are refugees.  If they’re not, then they should be sent  home as quickly as possible.  Whether or not those other measures are needed remains to 

 be seen, but we do need to speed up the processing.  It’s taking far too long and of course  management of these people in detention becomes that much more difficult.   

 JOURNALIST:  But the world is on the verge of a war with Iraq so it’s hardly likely that  those from Iraq will be likely to go back.   

 MACKLIN: Well I very much hope we’re not on the verge of a war with Iraq.  I very much  hope that the weapons inspectors in Iraq can get on with the job that they’re doing, that we  can see Iraq disarmed without going to war.   

 JOURNALIST: But can you see that it would be difficult to send people back to Iraq at this  stage?   

 MACKLIN: That may be so but you were talking about war and as far as I am concerned we  want to see peace in the Middle East not war and we want to see the United Nations  weapons inspectors be able to get on with their job.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you have evidence that the current commercial managers of these  detention centres have been deficient?   

 MACKLIN:  Well I think the evidence is in the problems that continually exist, not just the  current problems.  There have been problems over a number of years with the management  of the detention centres.  From our point of view, that’s one reason to return the  management of detention centres to the public sector.  The other reason is we really want  there to be much more public information about what goes on in the detention centres.  We  think the media should be able to properly examine what happens in the detention centres,  that medical experts should be able to speak freely about what goes on as well so that  doesn’t happen at the moment.  We want much more public accountability of the  management practices in detention centres.   

 JOURNALIST:  The psychiatrists have called for an inquiry into the mental health facilities in  the detention centres.  Would you support them?   

 MACKLIN:  Well as you know we in fact were wanting in inquiry into the whole management  process of detention.  What we’re saying now is we want the management of the detention  centres returned to the public sector, taken out of the hands of these private operators, and  we want much more public access, public accountability, as to what goes on inside. 

 

 JOURNALIST:  Is there any suggestion that ACM might have let its guard down, as it were,  because it’s on the way out anyway?   

 MACKLIN: I don’t have any evidence to that effect so I’m not sure.   

 JOURNALIST: There’s talk of extra security and perhaps revocation of television rights and  radio rights and telephone access for detainees.  Are these measures appropriate given the  unrest this week or are they perhaps going too far?   

 MACKLIN: Well they are matters really that have to be resolved on the spot.  I don’t think  that they are things that we should comment on here.    

 JOURNALIST: I know you were asked about Silverwater before but what about the seven  who were taking away from Woomera yesterday in handcuffs?  They are in police custody,  they haven’t been charged.  They have been in custody for a day. 

 

 MACKLIN:  Well they really are matters for the police and I haven’t got any further  information so I don’t want to comment any further today.   

 JOURNALIST: What is the Opposition’s position on the strip-searching that has come out  today?    

 MACKLIN: Well once again they are matters for the police.  I don’t want to get into the  police activities.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you agree the ALP … refugee advocacy groups… their behaviour?   

 MACKLIN: Well I don’t think anybody should be.  I don’t have any evidence as to whether or  not there has been any advocacy of this sort of behaviour but nobody should be advocating  any behaviour that puts people’s lives at risk and certainly these fires and this violence will  put people’s lives at risk; both the people who live in the detention centres and those who  work there.
