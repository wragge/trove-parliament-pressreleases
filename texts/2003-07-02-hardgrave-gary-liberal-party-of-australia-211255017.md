   Media Release H84/2003 - 2 July 2003

 

 New Contracts for Migrant English Tuition in WA

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, today announced the  awarding of contracts worth $35 million that will provide English language tuition to nearly  9,000 migrants and refugees in Western Australia over the next five years. 

 'I congratulate West Coast College TAFE and Central TAFE on winning the contracts for  Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) delivery. The contracts will enable English language  tuition to migrants and refugees from more than 80 countries and 70 language  backgrounds,' Mr Hardgrave said.

 'The contract with both colleges will enable AMEP tuition delivery across the state, including  to clients in the Perth CBD and rural and regional clients through classroom and community  based program delivery.'

 'Additionally, the West Coast College of TAFE will provide tuition through distance learning  and the Home Tutor Scheme, whereby clients study English 'one on one' in their own  homes, with the help of a volunteer tutor,'

 'This flexibility of delivery ensures that wherever AMEP clients are and whatever their  circumstances and learning preferences, they will be able to access tuition which is most  appropriate to their needs,' Mr Hardgrave said.

 Nationally, the Federal Government has allocated more than $500 million over the next five  years to the AMEP, including $114 million in the next financial year.

 Mr Hardgrave said that the new contracts with AMEP service providers in each state and  territory would help more than 100,000 new arrivals on their journey to successful settlement  in Australia.

 'The Adult Migrant English Program is a vital component of the Government's commitment to  'nation building,' community harmony and cohesion,' Mr Hardgrave said. 

 'It represents a significant investment by the Commonwealth in ensuring that new arrivals  have every opportunity to learn our national language, and so take the first and most  important step towards full participation in Australian society.'

 'I look forward to our continued successful partnership with West Coast College of TAFE and  Central TAFE, which will best serve the needs of AMEP clients, the community and Australia  as a whole,' Mr Hardgrave said. 

 While in Perth, the Minister will also conduct settlement consultations on the implementation  of the Review of Settlement Services for Migrants and Humanitarian Entrants.

 'This review has been invaluable in providing a clearer picture of what needs to be done to  better meet the needs of newly arrived migrants and refugees,' Mr Hardgrave said.
