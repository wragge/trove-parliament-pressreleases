 Construction Begins on the New Sydney Residential Housing Project 

 VPS 067/2005

 In line with the Government’s continuing commitment to provide alternative arrangements for women and children in immigration detention,  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone today officially began construction of a new  Residential Housing Project in Sydney.

 'We are always looking to develop our alternative detention arrangements for immigration detainees with special needs, particularly women and  children,” the Minister said.

 'In the past, women and children in Villawood IDC have moved to the Port Augusta RHP in South Australia for a more domestic environment.

 'This new RHP in Sydney will mean eligible women and children at Villawood can live independently in family-style accommodation while still  remaining close to their established support networks.”

 Senator Vanstone said the Sydney RHP, which will accommodate about 40 residents in the Miowera Road site, will be the first purpose-designed  and built RHP.

 'The RHP will comprise of four duplex houses, or eight units, each with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen and two living and dining areas.  At least one house will be configured to accommodate residents with disabilities,” the Minister said.

 'Security will be discreet, involving security cameras and alarms. The RHP will be surrounded by a typical suburban fence, allowing it to blend  with the surrounding residential environment.'

 Senator Vanstone said living in the RHP would give the residents a level of control over their day-to-day lives which was not possible in the  normal detention environment, including allowing them to cook their own meals and be responsible for the running of their homes.

 'This will include accompanied visits to local shops as well as local recreational facilities and educational and other activities. Children can also  attend local schools,' the Minister said.

 Men who have family members living in the RHP will be able to visit regularly with them.

 Construction of the Sydney RHP is due to be completed in March 2006 and it will be ready for use by mid-2006.

 An RHP has been operating in Port Augusta, South Australia since November 2003. 

 'We are also developing an RHP with a capacity for 12 people in Perth, near the Perth IDC, which is expected to be finished in late 2006,' the  Minister said.
