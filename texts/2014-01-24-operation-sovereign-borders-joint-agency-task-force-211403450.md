 Operation Sovereign Borders Report Confirms 36 Days  Without A Boat - Minister for Immigration and Border  Protection 

 24-01-2014 -  

 The Government welcomes today's Operation Sovereign Borders weekly update confirming  that there have been no persons illegally arriving by boat transferred to our immigration  authorities for 36 days. 

 This is the longest period of no illegal boat arrivals since March of 2009, when arrivals first  started to significantly escalate as a consequence of the former Labor Government's decision  to abolish the strong border protection regime they inherited from the Howard Government. 

 In the first 100 days of Operation Sovereign Borders illegal arrivals by boat declined by more  than 80%, taking us back to the levels being experienced at the time of the 2010 election. 

 While these results were pleasing, arrivals of around 300 per month do not constitute success.  Being able to sustain a zero rate of arrivals for more than five weeks, takes us further, but  these outcomes need to be sustained. 

 This is not the time for stepping back, but to maintain the full pressure of our operations on  criminal people smugglers, that are clearly getting results. 

 As always the Australian Government will continue to work with any and all partners,  especially within our region to defeat the people smugglers and to continue to keep them  informed of our own efforts and activities. 

 It is also pleasing to confirm that the detention population on Christmas Island is now below  2,000 persons for the first time since February last year. During the peak of Labor's border  failures last year this population increased to more than 3,000 detainees. 

 Continued transfers to Nauru and Manus Island, made possible by the current zero arrival rate  and the expansion of our offshore processing capacity undertaken under Operation Sovereign  Borders, means we will continue to be able to reduce the pressure on Christmas Island. 

 I commend all of our personnel involved in Operation Sovereign Borders for their  professional and dedicated efforts so far in achieving these outcomes. Whether patrolling at  sea, working with our partners on land to disrupt smugglers up through the chain or operating  our processing centres off shore, they are doing a great job for our country.
