 THE HON KIM C BEAZLEY MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR DEFENCE  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BRAND

 SCRAFTON HIT COMING AND GOING   

 Last night the Government's spear thrower Senator George Brandis  claimed that Mike Scrafton has given inconsistent accounts of what he  told the Prime Minister about the child overboard claim.   

 This is simply not true.   

 It is a matter of public record that Mr Scrafton was among those  interviewed as part of an internal investigation conducted by Ms Jennifer  Bryant, an officer of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.   

 All interviewees including Mr Scrafton were sent a letter from Ms Bryant  making it clear that the inquiry was limited in scope (copy attached).    

 The inquiry was specifically limited to what information was provided to  Ministers about the issue of whether children were thrown overboard by  asylum seekers, not what information was given to the Prime Minister.   

 Further, in a record of interview of Mr Scrafton by Ms Bryant that the  Prime Minister himself released, it was stated up front that:   

 Mr Scrafton stated that he had been involved in or aware of a number of  discussions between Mr Reith's office and the Prime Minister's office and  the Prime Minister, which he could not discuss.    

 The fact that Mr Scrafton could not disclose certain key conversations,  and therefore that the information he provided was incomplete, was  made clear at the time of the release of the interview minutes.    

 As we now all know, Mr Scrafton spoke to the Prime Minister on a  number of occasions on the evening of November 7 2001.   

 None of the advice or views that Mr Scrafton gave to the Prime Minister  during those conversations formally fell within the scope of the Bryant  inquiry.   

 Inded, the terms of the Bryant inquiry were explicitly established by the  Prime Minister, with the effect of excluding from it inquiry into what  information was provided directly to him.    

 This is a critical detail that Senator Brandis neglected to mention last  night, as he accused Mr Scrafton of having a faulty memory and giving  inconsistent accounts.   

 Mr Scrafton answered the questions he was asked by the Bryant inquiry,  and for the thoroughly understandable reasons he has proferred did not  elaborate gratuitously.   

 This latest attempt to belittle Mr Scrafton goes to the integrity of his  critics, not himself.
