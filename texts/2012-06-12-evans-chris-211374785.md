 SENATOR THE HON CHRIS EVANS  Leader of the Government in the Senate  Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research   

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 12 June 2012   

 Science projects to inspire Australians   

 Australians will be able to take part in hands-on local science activities thanks to a $5  million grant from the Gillard Government for Inspiring Australia projects across the country.   

 Minister for Science and Research, Senator Chris Evans, today announced the 63  successful applicants for the Australian Government’s Unlocking Australia’s Potential  grants.   

 “The projects are aimed at developing greater interest in science, especially for those who  might have missed out on the opportunity to engage with science before,” Senator Evans  said.    

 “We’re rolling out a diverse range of local projects set to inspire and engage Australians in  science.   

 “People will have the chance to become part of nation-wide research projects, such as  helping to build up complete pictures of our marine life, whales’ migration paths and the  paths and landing places of meteors.   

 “These community-based science projects will build a more complete picture for our  scientists and researchers and help the community feel part of science in the making.”   

 The grant recipients, including museums, universities and Indigenous organisations will use  their knowledge and skills to put science firmly on Australia’s agenda and inspire  Australians to take up science at school and university.   

 Other projects announced today include robotic workshops for future young engineers  across rural Queensland, the development of a free Apple/Android app that will help people  identify native creatures and a two-day camp for 30 young refugee migrants to inspire them  to pursue science at school.   

 “The Gillard Government recognises the importance of science to our economic prosperity  and that is why we have maintained our record investment,” Senator Evans said.   

 “Science is central to driving innovation and lifting Australia’s productivity, competitiveness  and wealth.”   

 The grants are part of the $21 million Inspiring Australia initiative. Fifty-two of the projects  have a major regional focus.   

 A complete list of successful grant projects is attached.
