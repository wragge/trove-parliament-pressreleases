 THE HON DR SHARMAN STONE MP  Federal Member for Murray  Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 

 Tuesday 7 April 2009 

 

 

 Urgent inquiry demanded: Why was the boat left stuck on a reef for four days?   

 There is growing anger and concern about the botched or deliberate neglect of the boat of more than 50  alleged asylum seekers left stranded on the Warrior Reef for four days last week.   

 “This boat had been under surveillance before it struck the reef and the new Customs and Border Security  agency knew the boat was in trouble,” Dr Sharman Stone, Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship said.   

 “It was 30km off York Island and 60 km away from Thursday Island. Warrior reef is dangerous and quite  clearly the boat was in serious trouble.”   

 “Mr Rudd must demand an immediate inquiry to be undertaken by Minister Debus.”   

 “We need to know who failed to take the decision to rescue this boat as soon as it was evident that it had  gone aground on the reef,” Dr Stone said.   

 “Why was the decision delayed for four days? Where is the boat now? What has this new agency done to  guarantee the boat and its contents are no longer a quarantine risk in the Torres Strait?”   

 “These are all very critical questions which need to be asked and answered in order that we can have  some sense of confidence in Australia’s border security and quarantine measures.”   

 “It is not good enough to hope the public will simply not find out about such incidents,” Dr Stone said.   

 “At the same time as this boat was smashing on a reef in the Torres strait, another boat with more than  60 asylum seekers was being secretly monitored and taken into tow near Ashmore reef off Western  Australia. In this case it took some four days before the episode was reported.”   

 “Clearly we need to know what this new policy of secrecy and silence means. Is it an attempt to cover  incompetence or is it simply that this new service is so starved of funds that it can do very little but  watch?”
