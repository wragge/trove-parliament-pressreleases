 First 100 Days Of Operation Sovereign Borders Finishes  With No Illegal Boat Arrivals - Minister for Immigration  and Border Protection 

 27-12-2013 -  

 For the fourth time since Operation Sovereign Borders commenced on 18 September there  have been no persons transferred to Australian immigration authorities during the past week  from suspected illegal entry vessels (SIEVs), Minister for Immigration and Border Protection,  the Hon Scott Morrison said today. 

 While more monsoon-like conditions are beginning to set in, for most of December the weather  conditions have been highly favourable to making these voyages.   

 The latest nil reading for transfers of illegal maritime arrivals (IMAs) to immigration  authorities was accompanied by a further 42 IMAs being sent to Nauru in the past week,  bringing the total population at Nauru to 841, with a further 1,229 at Manus island, where there  were no transfers during the past week.   

 So far in December there have been 355 IMAs on 7 boats. This represents a 70% decline on  last December, when there were 1,149 IMAs on 20 boats. So far this is the lowest number of  arrivals in December for five years.   

 This latest reporting period brings up the first 100 days of Operation Sovereign Borders.   

 During the first 100 days of Operation Sovereign Borders there have been 1,106 IMAs and 45  crew on 22 SIEVs transferred to immigration authorities. This represents an 87% reduction on  the 100 days that preceded the establishment of this operation.   

 During the first 100 days of Operation Sovereign Borders there has been an average of just 145  IMAs on 3 boats arriving a fortnight. This compares to around 920 people on more than a  dozen boats each fortnight between the introduction of the previous Government’s regional  resettlement arrangement with Papua New Guinea and the establishment of Operation  Sovereign Borders.   

 The Coalition’s experience since coming to Government has shown that no single measure and  no single partner is responsible for the dramatic fall in arrivals. Rather it is the combination of  all measures, backed by the strong and consistent resolve of a Government that believes in  stronger border protection measures, as opposed to the previous Government that had to be  dragged kicking and screaming to make any positive changes.   

 During the first 100 days of Operation Sovereign Borders the Government has been focussed  on implementing the policies we took to the election which have seen: 

 ï· $67 million in additional promised funding to expand disruption and deterrence  operations across the region, as part of our regional deterrence framework, in  cooperation with our partners not just in Indonesia, but in Sri Lanka and Malaysia as  well. This has seen more than 1,500 people prevented from coming to Australia. Visits 

 to boost cooperation have been conducted to Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka,  Myanmar and source countries in the Middle East;  ï· filling the $1.2 billion funding black hole from Labor that left offshore processing  facilities underfunded, ill equipped and under capacity - physical capacity has been 

 doubled and a new 48 hour transfer policy is ensuring that offshore processing under  the Coalition is a reality for those who seek to come here illegally, not just more talk as  it was under Labor;  ï· the salvaging of resettlement arrangements with PNG that were little more than a blank  sheet of paper under the previous Government and commencement of construction on  post assessment accommodation at both Nauru and Manus island for IMAs found to be  refugees;  ï· expansion of our maritime operations under Border Protection Command to provide  active deterrence to those seeking to enter Australia illegally by boat - this is no longer  a taxi service;  ï· the denial of permanent visas to all persons who had previously arrived illegally in  Australia by boat, under the previous Government; and,  ï· quarantining protection visas provided to people who apply offshore in camps and other  similar places to ensure their places cannot be taken by those who arrive illegally on  boats. 

 

 The boats have not yet stopped but they are stopping. The right policies are now in the right  hands, and they are getting the right results on our borders, as we promised.   

 In the coming months the Government will continue to apply itself across the full spectrum of  measures that we know are necessary to stop the boats. This will include making further  improvements to our offshore processing facilities, particularly to ensure appropriate  accommodation and health facilities for families on Nauru where new funding has been put in  place, as well as reorganising our contractual arrangements for service providers across both  offshore processing locations to ensure a more integrated operation.   

 Maritime deterrence operations will continue as we also look to implement our expanded  regional cooperation in Malaysia and to restore joint operations with Indonesia as soon as  possible.   

 I wish to commend all of our officers, crew, officials and service providers for their service  over our first 100 days and extend a special thank you to those who will be working at sea,  throughout the region, at our offshore facilities at Nauru and Manus Island and at Christmas  Island over the difficult summer months ahead.
