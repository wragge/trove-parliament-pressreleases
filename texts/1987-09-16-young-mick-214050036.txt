 AUTHORITY TO WORK TO BE GIVEN TO GENUINE APPLICANTS FOR  RESIDENT OR REFUGEE STATUS

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Mick Young, announced today that people who enter  Australia and subsequently apply for resident or refugee  status will be given permission to work while their cases 

 are decided, provided they meet certain criteria.

 Mr Young said people in such circumstances had been affected  by the Government's May Economic Statement as part of which  special benefits for some people would cease on 1 October  this year.

 Provided an applicant was assessed as prima facie eligible  for the grant of resident or refugee status, permission to  work would be given, he said.

 "Such permission offers the prospect of self-sufficiency for  people in these circumstances," he said. "They will, of  course, also contribute to the economy through payment of  income tax.

 "However I must stress that unjustified or frivolous claims  to remain in Australia will not be entertained, nor will  people making such claims be rewarded by being given  permission to work.

 "Such permission will be given only to genuine applicants  with the prospect of eventual approval to remain here."

 Mr Young pointed out that procedures for processing  applications for resident and refugee status were being  streamlined by his Department to reduce delays in  decision-making to a minimum.

 "The Government has a dual responsibility in these matters -  to the general public and to those people in Australia who  have legitimate claims to resident or refugee status," he  said.

 "While the sensitivities of such decision-making are fully  appreciated, we have to ensure that we do not create a  device that can be abused, while at the same time  facilitating the well-being of legitimate applicants while  their claims are being examined.

 "In essence, the only fair and equitable arrangement that  can be established is a case-by-case assessment of the  applicants' prima facie claims.

 "We have developed a system which is designed to do just  that.

 "When it is taken in conjunction with our move to  significantly faster processing of claims, the system should  protect the best interests of the legitimate applicants and  the Australian community."
