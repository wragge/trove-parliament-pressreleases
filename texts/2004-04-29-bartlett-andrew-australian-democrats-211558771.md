 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/325 THURSDAY 29 APRIL 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS & SPOKESPERSON ON IMMIGRATION & MULTICULTURALISM  High Court rules not to protect children from Immigration Dept The Australian Democrats have expressed disappointment at today's High Court decision, saying it meant the Government's policy of keeping children in detention centres could continue without interference from the Family Court. "The South Australian Family Court had stood up to the Government to protect the rights of children in detention, but the Government has won on appeal to the High Court, the right to continue this institutionalised child abuse," said Democrats Leader and immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett. The Government had appealed an earlier decision, arguing that the Family Court has no jurisdiction over children of asylum seekers in detention and therefore no right to protect them. The Government was basically arguing that all agencies, organisations and people must adhere to child protection laws enforceable by the family court, except the Immigration Department who can do whatever they want even if it is rated as child abuse.  The family concerned escaped Afghanistan and were detained in Woomera, then Baxter. They have not met the strict definitions of refugees but even the Government recognises that they cannot be safely returned to Afghanistan yet. The South Australian Family court last year ruled that the indefinite detention of children was illegal under SA child protection laws and ordered the 5 children to be released into the care of a child welfare agency who have fostered them out.  "It is not ideal for families to be separated, however in some cases Family services have recommended this as the better option for children. The whole issue highlights the immorality of the Government policy of mandatory detention," said Senator Bartlett. "The priority now is to ensure the Government does not whisk the children back to the detention centre. The SA Government should consider options under the Children's Protection Act, if Minister Vanstone tries to return them to Baxter."  Senator Bartlett is meeting the solicitors acting for the family and other refugee advocates, in Adelaide tomorrow. On Saturday, Senator Bartlett and Democrat SA MLC Kate Reynolds will visit the Baxter Detention Centre. Media Contact - Rowena Bew - 0400 729 255
