 Australian Democrats Press  Releases

 Senator Natasha Stott Despoja  Democrats Senator for South Australia  Australian Democrats spokesperson for Attorney Generals 

 Dated: 11 November 2007  Portfolio: Attorney General & Justice  Related: Attorney Generals 

 

 

 Media alert: Democrats to launch national Human Rights Policy in Adelaide  tomorrow  The Democrats will take a stand against the death penalty - and call on the major parties to match  them - when they launch their national Human Rights Policy tomorrow at the Old Adelaide Gaol,  where hangings were carried out until the 1960s.   

 The policy will be launched by Julian Burnside QC, human rights advocate and champion of the  rights of asylum seekers and other marginalised groups.   

 "Forty five executions were carried out at Adelaide Gaol until 1964. While Australia has come a  long way since then, when you look at the plight of the Bali Nine you have to wonder how far we’ve  actually come on this and other key human rights issues," Democrats’ Attorney-General’s  Spokesperson Senator Natasha Stott Despoja said.   

 "Very little attention has been paid to human rights issues in this election campaign. The  Democrats believe respect for human rights should be at the top of the agenda."   

 The Democrats’ comprehensive policy for improved protection for human rights will be unveiled at  the launch.   

 When: 12pm CST speeches, followed by a picture opportunity at 12:30pm   Tomorrow, Monday November 12   

 Where: Old Adelaide Gaol  18 Gaol Rd, Thebarton
