 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship    Media Release 

 Minister Evans missing in action on Taufahema visa case 

 Sunday 18th April 2010 

 Labor’s Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, has once again gone 

 missing when it comes to making an important decision to revoke visas for people who defy 

 our laws, this time in the case of Motekiai Taufahema, Shadow Minister for Immigration and 

 Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today.  

 

 “Just like the Rudd Government has been a continual soft touch on our borders, Immigration 

 Minister Chris Evans has repeatedly demonstrated he is a soft touch when it comes to the 

 need for Australian visas to be cancelled on character grounds,” Mr Morrison said.  

 

 “Earlier this year Senator Evans refused to cancel the permanent protection visas provided 

 by the Rudd Government to the three asylum seekers on board SIEV36 found by the NT 

 Coroner to have been involved in a plan to scuttle the boat. This plan led to an explosion that 

 killed five people, injured dozens more and put Australian defence force personnel at risk. 

 They continue to hold their visas to this day.  

 

 “Now we learn of the Minister’s failure to cancel the visa of Motekiai Taufahema who is 

 serving a sentence for the manslaughter of NSW Senior Constable Glenn McEnally.  

 

 “Last week I wrote to Senator Evans providing my support for him to cancel Taufahema’s 

 visa under Section 501 of the Migration Act and agreed with his comments regarding the 

 serious nature of Taufahema’s crime.  

 

 “I am therefore disappointed that Senator Evans has proved to be all talk and failed to act, 

 instead preferring once again to delegate his decision off to Department officials and costly 

 court action, rather than exercise his power under the Act to the end this matter immediately.  

 

 “Every police officer in Australia must have the confidence that when they put themselves in 

 harm’s way for us and they fall in the line of duty that Governments at every level will provide 

 them and their families with the support they deserve, both at the time and in the future.  

 

 “In this case, it means taking the decision to cancel Taufahema’s visa and send a message 

 that if you violate our laws while enjoying the privilege of residency in Australia, you have 

 outstayed your welcome.  

 

 “We must protect the integrity of our visa system. Visas are not a right and in clear cases 

 where a visa holder has failed a basic character test, they should have their visa immediately 

 revoked.  

 

 “Despite both the Federal Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal overturning the 

 Department of Immigration and Citizenship’s decision to cancel Taufahema’s visa, the 

 Minister has the power under s501B of the Migration Act to set aside a delegate’s decision 

 even if the original decision is the subject of review by the AAT. 

 

 “The Coalition has urged the Minister to take action on this issue and he has failed to 

 respond.  

 

 “It’s a disgrace that Taufahema will be released into the Australian community at the end of 

 his sentence, rather than returned to Tonga.  

 

 “The Minister also failed in June 2009 when he removed a requirement for the AAT and 

 courts to consider the ‘expectations of the Australian community’ when reviewing the 

 cancellation of a visa.  

 

 “So, despite the fact that both the AAT and the Court found Taufahema did not meet 

 character provisions for his visa to continue and conceded that he posed a continued risk to 

 the Australian community, both jurisdictions placed greater weight on the ‘best interests’ of 

 Taufahema’s child and de facto partner.  

 

 “This is a Minister who has wound back the strong measures put in place by the Coalition to 

 protect the Australian community; whether that’s in relation to protecting our borders or 

 protecting the community from violent criminals.  

 

 “It’s about time Senator Evans started exercising the authority he has under the Migration 

 Act to protect the integrity of our immigration system and make decisions necessary to 

 protect the Australian community,” Mr Morrison said.
