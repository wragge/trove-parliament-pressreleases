 K140 arrives undetected as Kevin Rudd  refuses to listen on border protection  failures   23/06/10  

 The arrival of boat K140 undetected into Flying Fish Cove at Christmas Island shows that  people smugglers continue to have the upper hand over Kevin Rudd and his failed border  protection policies, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and  Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 “Kevin Rudd’s failure to secure our borders has sent over 6,500 people into the hands of  people smugglers for the dangerous journey to Australia in 140 boats,” he said. 

 “This is a booming industry that is being sustained by Kevin Rudd’s stubborn refusal to listen  to the concerns of the Australian people and change his policies to stop the unprecedented  illegal arrival of boats to Australia. 

 “Since the Rudd Government’s cynical election fix of suspending processing of asylum  seekers from Afghanistan and Sri Lanka was announced just eleven weeks ago, more than  1,500 people on 34 boats have arrived. 

 “This ineffective and discriminatory policy will only see more people indefinitely detained in  tents, overcrowded facilities and in remote areas, including the re-opened Curtin Detention  Centre and more border budget blowouts like the current $1 billion hole will emerge. 

 “The only boats Kevin Rudd wants to stop are those transporting minerals from our mines to  Asian markets. Only the Coalition has the policies and the will necessary to stop illegal boat  arrivals,” he said. 

 Mr Keenan said: “Despite the overwhelming concern of the Australian people and the arrival  of more boats each week, this Government still refuses to take any real action to secure our  borders. 

 “Kevin Rudd once declared war on the people smugglers. 

 “But now it appears that Rudd and the people smugglers have reached a truce, happy to co-exist under the current arrangement. 

 “The people smugglers keep selling their product of virtually guaranteed permanent residency  in Australia, while the Government maintains its taxi service to and from Christmas Island. 

 “If Kevin Rudd refuses to take action now, one wonders if he ever will. Only a change in  government will bring about a change in policy for border protection,” he said.
