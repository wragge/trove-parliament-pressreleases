 Strong Teamwork Key to Migration Management

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, signed a Memorandum of Understanding with  Papua New Guinea and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) today.

 The memorandum will improve the capacity of Australia’s neighbour to arrange care and voluntary return of irregular immigrants in PNG.

 Under the arrangement, PNG, Australia and IOM will co-operate in the areas of identification and processing of irregular immigrants transiting  PNG who might attempt to enter Australia unlawfully as well as counselling, care and voluntary return. 

 PNG will consider any claims for refugee status as appropriate.

 The IOM will provide counselling, accommodation, temporary care (including basic health care) as well as information and services such as travel  documentation and arrangements for voluntary return home. 

 ‘PNG will benefit from the assistance provided in this important area of migration management and Australia will benefit from working  cooperatively with PNG on border management,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 PNG’s Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration, Sir Rabbie Namaliu, and the IOM’s Regional Representative, Denis Nihill, were the other  signatories to the memorandum at a ceremony held during the 17th annual PNG-Australia Ministerial Forum on the Gold Coast.

 ‘ This agreement demonstrates the strength of our working relationship in the management of migration issues,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 She added Australia would meet the costs of these IOM programs.
