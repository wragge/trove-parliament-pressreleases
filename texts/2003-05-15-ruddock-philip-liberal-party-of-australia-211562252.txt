 Consultations On Alternative Detention Arrangements In  Port Hedland  

 MPS 33/2003 

 Community consultations will begin this week on the establishment of a residential  housing project (RHP) in Port Hedland, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and  Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, announced today. 

 The consultations with the Port Hedland Community Liaison Committee will focus on the  use of BHP's former visitors quarters - The Lodge - as the site for the RHP.  

 'The implementation of an RHP in Port Hedland is in line with the Government's policy to  provide alternative detention arrangements for women and children as a matter of  priority,' Mr Ruddock said. 

 'The housing projects enable eligible detainees to live in a more domestic environment,  while still in detention, and enjoy a greater degree of autonomy.' 

 The proposed RHP will involve the adaptation of an existing Commonwealth facility  comprising five airconditioned, hotel-style ensuite rooms, and central kitchen and dining  facilities, located approximately 700 metres east of the Port Hedland Immigration  Reception and Processing Centre.  

 'I look forward to the successful completion of the consultations with the Community  Liaison Committee so that eligible women and children in the Port Hedland centre can  benefit from the alternative arrangements as soon as possible.' 

 'The highly successful Residential Housing Project at Woomera serves as an excellent  model for the establishment of similar arrangements in other communities,' Mr Ruddock  said.  

 'I also note the high level of support provided by the Woomera community during the  recent expansion of that project.' 

 The Minister added that the consultations on three potential sites for an RHP in Port  Augusta RHP were progressing.
