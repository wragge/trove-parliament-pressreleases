 Budget 2000-2001 9 May 2000

 CUSTOMS TRANSPORT VESSEL FOR UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS Australian Customs will lease a vessel to transport intercepted boat people to the Australian mainland, Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone announced today.

 The vessel is likely to operate mainly off the north-west coast of Australia.

 "A dedicated transport vessel will reduce the need to use Customs and Navy vessels as transporters," Senator Vanstone said.

 "The funding will mean Customs and Australian Defence Force vessels will be able to focus on initial interception of suspect illegal entrant vessels."

 Customs will manage the charter vessel contract and provide the necessary security arrangements to ensure safe passage until the unauthorised arrivals are handed over to Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs officials.

 The funding will be finalised after an official tender process has been completed. The funding and effectiveness of the transport arrangement will be reviewed after two years.

 Lease of the charter vessel is part of a package of measures implemented in response to a report on Unauthorised Arrivals in Australia .

 "This arrangement shows the GovernmentÃ­s commitment to AustraliaÃ­s border protection," Senator Vanstone said.

  

 The way that the GST affects Budget estimates, accounting statements and appropriations is described in Budget Paper No.4.
