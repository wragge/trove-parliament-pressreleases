 Concerns remain over Malaysia deal: Greens   

 The Australian Greens remain deeply concerned over the Australia Government's  pursuit of a refugee people swap deal with Malaysia, following reports that an agreement  has been struck.  

  “We have very real concerns that anyone we send to Malaysia will not have the  protections of their rights and safety guaranteed,” Greens’ Immigration Spokesperson,  Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, said today.    

  “To continue to play ping pong with the lives of vulnerable people around the region is in  clear breach of our international obligations. 

 “It is time for the Australian Government to lead by example, not simply export our  obligations to another country, without addressing the real need for a genuine regional  protection framework. 

 The Greens are also concerned by reports that the Government are now looking to expel  the 438 people currently held on Christmas Island pending third country removal, to  Manus Island instead of Malaysia.  

  “As an act of compassion, the Government must assess the claims of protection of  these vulnerable people held on Christmas Island, including more than 70 children,  pregnant women, and families.   

 “It is time for the Government to stop wasting tax-payers money detaining these  vulnerable asylum seekers indefinitely, and immediately process their claims on the  mainland and resettle those found to be in genuine need of protection.
