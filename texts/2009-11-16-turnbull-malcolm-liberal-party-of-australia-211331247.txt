 TURNBULL DOORSTOP - QUESTION TIME, KEVIN RUDD'S FAILED BORDER  PROTECTION POLICIES, EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME 

 The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP  

 Leader of the Opposition 

 Last Friday the Prime Minister said no preferential deal had been offered to the asylum seekers on the Oceanic 

 Viking. He tabled today in the House a copy of the proposal put to them and it said, in the first point, ‘If the 

 UNHCR has found you to be a refugee - Australian officials will assist you to be resettled within 4-6 weeks’. 

 When we asked him whether there were any other refugees in Indonesia who had been guaranteed resettlement 

 within four to six weeks he had no answer because no others have been. This is plainly a preferential deal.  

 When we asked him whether he knew about this offer of a preferential fast track deal, a Rudd carpet to Australia, 

 when we asked him whether he knew about it beforehand or had approved it, he said “no and no”. And then at 

 the very end of Question Time, he came back to the despatch box to say that in fact it had been approved by a 

 committee on which sat members of his own office staff.  

 So the fact is that the Prime Minister has not been straight with the Australian people. Clearly this is a preferential 

 deal. There are no other refugees in Australia that are being guaranteed resettlement within four to six weeks. 

 And secondly, he knew all about this deal or at least his office did because they were part of the committee that 

 approved it. The Prime Minister has not been straight with the Australian people about his border protection 

 policy failure and the way he is rolling out the Rudd carpet to the people smugglers and their customers.  

 QUESTION:  

 Are you accusing him of misleading Parliament?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Look there is no question that he has misled the House, there is no question about that. The fact is it is a 

 preferential deal. He chose to hide behind a public servant, a letter from the Secretary of the Department of 

 Immigration dated today which said that the offer was consistent with the arrangements being… the group I 

 should say… I will read it precisely. The secretary said “the group” - being the people on the Oceanic Viking - “is 

 being treated in a manner consistent with that afforded to any other asylum seeker or refugee in Indonesia”.  

 Now that of course was written after the Prime Minister had said no preferential treatment had been given. But it 

 is perfectly obvious that it is not consistent with the treatment offered to other refugees in Indonesia. There are no 

 other refugees in Indonesia who are being guaranteed resettlement in Australia or anywhere else within four to 

 six weeks.  

 So that statement to the House and his attempt to hide behind a public servant - once again to use a public 

 servant as a human shield - is completely and utterly unconvincing. Everyone can see straight through that. But 

 then to say that he had no knowledge and did not approve the offer being made, only to come back and let us 

 know that in fact it had been made and approved by a committee on which sat members of his own office staff.  

 QUESTION:  

 It’s possible they didn’t tell him.  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Possible, yes, possible. A low level of possibility I think you would say, wouldn’t you.  

 QUESTION:  

 Kevin Rudd would be fairly sensitive about misleading Parliament, given what happened back in June. You think 

 he’d…  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Mr Rudd’s… there is no question that Mr Rudd’s staff approved the offer. He said as much. So the only basis on 

 which his statement could be correct is if his staff did not tell him. I grant you that is a possibility. I think most 

 people would regard it, on a matter as important as this, as being very unlikely. So we will see. Time will tell on 

 that score. As far as the deal being preferential, of course it is preferential. The suggestion that it’s not is absurd. 

 There is no other refugee group in Indonesia that is being offered a fast track to Australia. That’s perfectly plain. 

 So to say that the people on the Oceanic Viking were not offered a preferential deal is plainly false.  

 QUESTION:  

 So you’re accusing Kevin Rudd of lying to the Australian people?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 I’ll leave all those accusations to you. The fact of the matter is you know and everybody else knows that there 

 was a special deal offered to the people on the Oceanic Viking in order to persuade them to leave. That is 

 confirmed in writing today. We have asked Kevin Rudd several times whether any other refugees in Indonesia 

 have been offered the same fast track resettlement access and he has been unable to nominate any others. And 

 of course there are no others. So this is plainly a preferential deal, a special deal, and he should simply be 

 straight with the Australian people and confirm it for what it is.  

 QUESTION:  

 Mr Turnbull, confirmation on the weekend that there’s going to be no binding targets at Copenhagen. Does that 

 take the sting out of these next couple of weeks? Can you not now use that as a point to argue there’s no point 

 negotiating the scheme in the next couple of weeks?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well we have always said there is no necessity to finalise the design of the scheme before the Copenhagen 

 conference, but you know I have to say that I think most people have expected for a long time that Copenhagen 

 would result in a political agreement or a political settlement and any treaty, binding international agreement 

 would take some time to negotiate. But unlike Mr Rudd I don’t want to running a commentary on the negotiations 

 other than to say they have been proceeding well, they will reach a conclusion ad when they do we will then 

 decide as an Opposition how we are going to respond to it.  

 QUESTION:  

 [Inaudible]  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well we are going to proceed with the negotiations and take them through to their conclusion…  

 QUESTION:  

 And you’re still as committed to them as you were?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well I’m certainly committed to having good faith negotiations Michelle, but I am not committed to voting in a 

 particular way…  

 QUESTION:  

 But you’ve committed to trying to reach an outcome?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well everyone who enters into negotiations in good faith should be committed to reaching an outcome. Now 

 whether…  

 QUESTION:  

 [Inaudible]  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 No, but if you were as committed to letting me finish my answer we would be able to get o the end of the 

 sentence. We are committed to good faith negotiations which means we are committed to the negotiations 

 running their course. They will have an outcome. Whether that outcome is one which we support or not remains 

 to be seen, and really anything else is just speculation.  

 QUESTION:  

 Do you expect the final position to be determined tomorrow or next Tuesday?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well we don’t expect it to be determined tomorrow but it is obviously, time is marching on and I know that Mr 

 Macfarlane and Senator Wong are proceeding as quickly as they can, but the speed in large measure is 

 obviously determined by the Government because they are the ones from whom we are seeking concessions.  

 QUESTION:  

 So is an agreement more likely than not?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 I’m not going to run a commentary on the negotiations.  

 QUESTION:  

 A couple of Liberal senators have pre-empted the party room meeting and vowed to vote against the ETS. 

 Doesn’t that make the party room meeting a farce?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 I’m not going to comment on it…  

 QUESTION:  

 Are you prepared for that scenario, though, of many MPs, as Dennis Jensen told us this morning, crossing the 

 floor?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Look, we’ll see. I’m not going to run a commentary on other people’s comments and that’s really all I’ve got to 

 say. The negotiations are proceeding, they’ll have a conclusion, when we get to the conclusion we will decide 

 how we’re going to vote.  

 QUESTION:  

 Just back on your comments about Kevin Rudd and the boat. Probably most people would accept your argument 

 that it’s clearly a preferential deal. What do you think is in Mr Rudd’s mind as he tries to claim it’s not?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well I don’t know. It’s about as convincing as standing up and saying black is white. But he does have a habit of, 

 well he seems to have a habit of saying things which are patently not correct on the basis that if you say it often 

 enough people will believe it.  

 Now the fact of the matter is there are thousands of refugees, possibly tens of thousands of refugees in 

 Indonesia who have been granted refugee status by the UNHCR who are in exactly the same legal position as 

 the people who are on the Oceanic Viking. None of them have been offered a four to six week fast track passage 

 to Australia, whereas the people on the Oceanic Viking have.  

 So plainly it is a preferential deal. So why does he keep on saying that it isn’t? It’s baffling, it’s unconvincing - it 

 raises real questions about the Prime Minister.  

 QUESTION:  

 [Inaudible]  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well I don’t know. I’m the Leader of the Opposition. I’m not here to psychoanalyse the Prime Minister. I’ll leave 

 that to you.  

 QUESTION:  

 Should he revoke the deal?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well, look, he has made an offer to these people and if they’ve accepted it I guess there’s been an offer and 

 acceptance and there’s a question then of the integrity of the Australian Government at stake.  

 But we do not believe special deals should have been offered. We do not believe special deals should be offered 

 in the future and the reality is that this is all a consequence of a colossal failure in border protection policy.  

 QUESTION:  

 If you can’t offer special deals how are you going to get the remaining Sri Lankans off the boat?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well, really, that’s a matter you should be addressing to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was the one who 

 decided to take them to Indonesia. He says he had an agreement with the President of Indonesia that they would 

 be able to disembark but apparently this workaholic, master of detail, this supposed control freak was so focused 

 on the matter that he didn’t turn his mind to how he would actually persuade them to leave the vessel. And that 

 seems to be at the root of this problem.  

 The fact of the matter is it’s just one of a series of colossal policy errors in this border protection shambles that 

 Kevin Rudd has created. This is a colossal policy failure on any view and the sooner he owns up to it, takes 

 responsibility for it and starts to fix it, the better.  

 Okay, thanks very much.
