 Twenty-two Community Safety crime prevention projects have received a total of just under  $2.4 million in the second round of grants awarded under the National Community Crime Prevention  Programme (NCCPP), the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Chris Ellison, announced today. 

 “The Australian Government believes that communities are in the best position to recognise local  problems and find locally relevant solutions,” said Senator Ellison. 

 Encouraging broad community-based partnerships is a key component of the NCCPP in developing a  sustainable response to local crime and community safety issues. 

 “The successful projects demonstrated strong commitment from the community to work together, and  share the responsibility for, developing and delivering crime prevention strategies,” Senator Ellison  said. 

 “I commend all involved in the development of these successful projects,” said Senator Ellison.
