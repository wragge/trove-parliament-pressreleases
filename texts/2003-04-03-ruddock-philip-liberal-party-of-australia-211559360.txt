 Philip Ruddock MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 

 UK Asylum Proposals Worth Consideration

 MPS 21/2003

 UK proposals for regional management and transit processing centres to deal with a burgeoning asylum problem are worth  examination the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today.

 'The proposal by Britain to set up transit processing centres for asylum seekers arriving in the UK and other European Union  countries bears a remarkable similarity to Australia's offshore processing on Nauru and PNG,' Mr Ruddock said.

 'It is clear the vast bulk of asylum claimants in Europe are not refugees and this is putting enormous strain on resources,  dealing with people who are seeking a migration outcome, but are using the asylum system to do so.

 'The observation by the British Government that support for refugees is badly distributed is in line with Australia's concerns  that the world's most vulnerable refugees are not getting the assistance they deserve.

 'I warmly welcome the proposal to improve regional management and deal with protection problems at the source, rather than  allowing people smugglers to dictate who benefits from asylum systems.

 'It is also encouraging to see Britain advocating that European countries play a greater role in resettlement programs.

 Australia is one of only about nine countries that has a significant or planned program to resettle refugees and humanitarian  entrants and more needs to be done in addressing refugee problems at their source,' Mr Ruddock said.
