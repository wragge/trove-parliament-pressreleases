 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 20 November 2015   

 Refugee boat off of Christmas Island should be  allowed to land safely   

 The Australian Greens have called on the government to allow a refugee boat, currently off of the  Christmas Island coast, to safely land and unload its passengers.   

 “The safest thing to do now is to let these people land on Christmas Island and find out who they are,”  the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The government needs to be up front with the Australian people and explain how many people are on  board this boat and what condition they are in. The government also needs to explain whether there are  women and children on board.   

 “It’s clear that, despite the government’s repeated claims, the boats haven’t stopped.   

 “If the government really does care about saving lives at sea, they wouldn’t tow this boat away from  Christmas Island, they would let it land safely.”
