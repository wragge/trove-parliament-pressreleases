 EMERGENCY RELIEF FOR NEEDY IN SA

 Grants to assist needy people in the community to deal with  crisis situations have been made by the Federal Government.

 The Federal Government will provide $1,611 million in grants  under the Emergency Relief Program in 1992-93 to 74 local  community welfare agencies. This is an increase of about  $100,000 over the previous year.

 Funding is provided to community agencies who normally  distribute emergency assistance as one of a range of  activities they undertake in assisting needy clients,  including low income families and single parents.

 They can provide immediate assistance on a discretionary  basis for expenses such as food, clothing or other  essentials, or for payment of electricity, gas or rental

 These grants are part of a total Emergency Relief funding  allocation of $18,352 million being provided throughout  Australia in 1992-93.

 This represents an increase of some $2.01 million or 12.3%  over the funding provided in 1991-92.

 The grants being made at this time represent the second  allocation of funds to Emergency Relief agencies this  financial year. An initial payment was made in July.

 A list of South Australian agencies receiving Emergency  Relief grants in 1992-93, and their allocations, is attached.
