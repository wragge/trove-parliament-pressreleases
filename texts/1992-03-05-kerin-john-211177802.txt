 Australian food aid for Mozambicans

 Australia will provide emergency food aid and other relief assistance worth about $5 million for displaced people in Mozambique and Mozambican refugees in Malawi, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, John Kerin, announced today.

 "More than five million Mozambicans have been affected by the ten year old civil war in their country," Mr Kerin said. "Many are dependent on emergency food aid."

 Mr Kerin said that more than one million Mozambicans have sought refuge in neighbouring Malawi, Zimbabwe and South Africa. The host communities cannot support the refugees without outside assistance.

 Australian assistance consists of both food aid and other components, to be channelled through international organisations and Australian non government organisations as follows:

 â¢ 2 000 tonnes of Australian wheat and 1 000 tonnes of Australian rice for Mozambique, through World Vision Australia. (These consignments will be sold at market prices in Maputo and Tete City and the funds used to purchase white maize, building materials and finance internal transport

 costs);

 â¢ 1 500 tonnes of Australian yellow split peas for refugee feeding program in Malawi, through the World Food Programme; â¢ More than $1 million for agricultural activities, child survival and emergency response in Mozambique's Tete and Zambezia provinces,

 through World Vision Australia; â¢ $500 000 for amputee transit centres and emergency food and health activities in Mozambique, through Save the Children Fund Australia; â¢ $300 000 for emergency assistance in southern Mozambique, through

 Australian Catholic Relief; and â¢ $150 000 for a fuel and energy conservation and reforestation project in Malawi, through Austcare.

 Australian assistance to displaced and refugee Mozambicans forms part of the Australian aid program, administered by AIDAB, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau. * * * * * *
