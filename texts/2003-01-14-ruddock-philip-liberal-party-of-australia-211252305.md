 Philip Ruddock MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS  AFFAIRS

 Further Returns Brings Detention Numbers Down

 MPS 3/2003

 The return of 34 unlawful non-citizens from Christmas Island to Sri Lanka last night reaffirmed the success of the  Government's border control strategy, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock,  said today.

 "The momentum building in both returning people to their countries of origin and stopping others risking their lives in  perilous unlawful journeys to Australia is seen in the significant decline in detainee numbers across the country," Mr Ruddock  said.

 As at 9 January there were 1,165 detainees in mainland immigration detention compared with the historical high of 3,721 in  August 2001.*

 Numbers in the offshore facilities have also fallen dramatically with the total population in the Nauru and Manus centres at  680 (as at 3 January) - down from a peak of 1,515.

 In the coming weeks further transfers from the offshore centres are expected including the resettlement of a group of 150  people accepted by New Zealand.

 "With the removal of the group to Sri Lanka, overnight there are now just 12 detainees at the Christmas Island facility," Mr  Ruddock said.

 The 34 men who were returned to Sri Lanka departed Christmas Island on a charter flight early yesterday morning and arrived  in Colombo late last night.

 Sixteen of the group arrived unlawfully by boat at Cocos (Keeling) Islands in October 2001, 11 of the men arrived unlawfully  by boat at Cocos (Keeling) Islands in December 2001 and seven were apprehended whilst engaged in illegal fishing in waters  off Western Australia in December last year. 

 A number of the men were also believed to have been involved in the two arson incidents in December last year leaving a  damage bill of $A1.6 million for the Christmas Island facilities.

 "None of the group engaged Australia's protection obligations and were returned with the cooperation of the Sri Lankan  Government," the Minister said. 

 "Australia will continue to build on its successful strategy to address the problems associated with illegal migration by  working closely with other countries to secure the return of people found to have no legal basis to remain here and by  deterring people from embarking on dangerous voyages with unscrupulous people smugglers."

 * Note: Less than half those detained on the mainland today are unauthorised boat arrivals. Most detainees are there as a result  of compliance action on overstayers and illegal workers. Of boat arrivals, more than 350 are available for removal having  exhausted all avenues to remain in Australia and are clearly not refugees.
