 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 Mr X must be released and mandatory detention must end 

 30th Mar 06

 Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today called on Minister  Vanstone to immediately grant Australia's longest immigration  detainee a permanent protection visa as recommended by the  Ombudsman last night.   

 “I met Mr X during a visit to Glenside Psychiatric Hospital on 14  March this year.  He has the unenviable status of being the new  Peter Qasim hidden away from public view,“ said Senator Nettle.   

 “When I met Mr X, he explained to me the dangers he faced if he  was returned to Bangladesh or placed back into an immigration  detention centre.  He should be released.   

 “I’m sure Mr X will be relieved that the Ombudsman has made these  recommendations.  After six long years he will be happy that  someone has officially recognised the terrible situation he has been  placed in by this government.   

 “Indefinite detention of innocent people is still permitted under the  Migration Act.  The Greens believe this is unacceptable and the law  must change.   

 “Yet again we have a report highly critical of mandatory detention.   The policy is a failure.  The government’s immigration system is like  a factory sucking in healthy people and spitting out damaged  human beings.     

 “The Minister must ensure that Mr X has appropriate care when he  is released.  It is her Government that has damaged his health and  it must take responsibility for helping him to heal.”
