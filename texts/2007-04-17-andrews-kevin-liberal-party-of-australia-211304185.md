 War Crimes MOU and Asylum Agreement Signed 

 Tuesday, 17 April 2007 

 Tonight the Australian Government has signed a Memorandum of  Understanding (MOU) on War Crimes Screening Cooperation with Canada,  the United Kingdom and the United States at the Four Country Conference. 

 Under the MOU the four signatory countries will engage in greater co-operation to assist in the identification and investigation of alleged  perpetrators of genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity. 

 The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that perpetrators of  genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity are identified and brought  to justice. 

 The Australian Government has also signed an agreement with the United  States of America to provide mutual assistance for the resettlement of people  in need of international protection. 

 The Mutual Assistance Arrangement was only made possible because of the  close co-operation that exists between the two countries. 

 Under this arrangement, the US will consider people who arrive in excised  offshore places and have been taken to Nauru for further processing. 

 In turn, Australia will consider for resettlement asylum seekers intercepted by  the United States. 

 This arrangement will ensure the integrity of the international system of  protection and the integrity of Australiaâ€™s borders is maintained, by providing  protection to those who need it. 

 It also sends a strong deterrence message to people smugglers.
