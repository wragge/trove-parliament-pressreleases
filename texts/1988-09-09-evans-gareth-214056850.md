 REPORTED USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST KURDS

 * ^ 4

 The M in i st er  for Foreign A f f a i r s  and Trade, Senator Gareth  

 Evans, said today that he was disturbed by p er si st en t re p o rt s ,  

 including from refugees, that chemical weapons were being used  

 against Kurdish t ri b e s  in Northern I r a q .  Although conclusive  

 evidence was hard to acquire because of the remoteness of the  

 region and the nature of chemical weapons, the reports appeared  

 to be cred ib le  and could not be ignored.

 Senator Evans repeated the unequivocal condemnation of the  

 Au stra li an  Government and people at the use, under any  

 circumstances, of these h o r r i f y i n g  weapons, p a r t i c u l a r l y  

 against c i v i l i a n  populations.

 He called on the 40-member Conference on Disarmament in Geneva  

 to redouble i ts  e f f o r t s  to conclude, as speedily as p os sib le, a  

 comprehensive and universal Convention banning chemical weapons  

 for a l l  time and in a l l  places.

 The Prime M i n i s t e r ,  Mr Hawke, announced in New York in June  

 this  year that A u s tr a l i a  would launch a regional i n i t i a t i v e  

 against chemical weapons. A u s tr a l i a  has had i n i t i a l  

 discussions with some regional countries and a team of  

 o f f i c i a l s  w i l l  v i s i t  ASEAN c a p i t a l s  in the near f u t u re  to  

 pursue t h is o b j e c t i v e .

 Senator Evans noted the co-operative a t t i t u d e  of the Au stra li an  

 chemical industry in the implementation of export controls to  

 ensure that chemicals manufactured in or trans-shipped through  

 A u s tr a l i a  were not, even i n a d v e r t e n t l y ,  associated with the  

 manufacture of chemical weapons.
