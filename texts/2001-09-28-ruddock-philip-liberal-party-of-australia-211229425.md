 Social Cohesion Promoted in New Partnerships

 MPS 169/2001

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today announced six new partnerships under the "Living in Harmony" program designed to promote social cohesion and tolerance while addressing racism and prejudice.

 The partnerships are funded under a Budget allocation of $2.5 million for a 12-month period and will build on the 26 Living in Harmony projects already completed successfully.

 Under the partnerships program, the Federal Government works together with government and non-government organisations to implement co-operative ventures with a national focus. The partnerships are one part of a three-pronged program with the other elements comprising community grants and the annual Harmony Day celebrations.

 Mr Ruddock said he was confident the six new partnership projects would maintain the momentum generated under the program.

 "The scope of the projects and range of partners demonstrate the Government's strong commitment to ensure that all Australians can play a part in maintaining and improving community harmony and social cohesion," he said.

 The new partnerships are:

 Networking Our Futures with the Australian Information Industry Association and ATSIC. It will increase education, training and employment opportunities for indigenous people in the information and communication technology sector and promote the Living in Harmony message.
