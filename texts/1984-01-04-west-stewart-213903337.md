 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION  AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 $7.5M IN MIGRANT WELFARE GRANTS

 Grants for migrant welfare valued at $7.5 million over the   next three years were announced today by the Minister for   Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Stewart West. .

 "The grants will enable 100 organisations to employ social   welfare staff to help migrants with their settlement," Mr West said.  "Tens of thousands of migrants who look to   these organisations for welfare services will benefit from  

 the grants." _

 Ethnic and other community organisations are eligible for   assistance under the Grant-in-Aid Scheme. Grants are for   three years and are currently valued in the range $22 130   - $32 420 per year.  A total of 93 full grants and 11 half   grants have been awarded.  In addition, another grant has   been earmarked for Newcastle and the name of the  

 successful organisation will be announced soon.

 "This reflects a big increase in the Grant-in-Aid Scheme,"   Mr West said. "This financial year the Government   increased funding for the Scheme by fifty per cent, in   line with its election commitment.

 "As a result of this expansion, many smaller and more   recently arrived communities, and segments of larger   ethnic communities can be assisted for the first time.   Grants also have been given for groups with special needs  

 such as refugee youth without close family in Australia   and migrant women in industry.

 "The Government is also concerned to ensure that union   services meet migrants' needs and several new grants have   been directed to unions with a high proportion of migrant   members.

 "Despite the extra grants, it has not been possible to   help all applicants. Interest in the scheme has been   extremely high in 1983-84 with applications for a total of   279 grants received. .

 "They came from a very wide range of community and ethnic  organisations throughout Australia. It is impressive that  there is so much interest in the welfare of migrants, and  willingness to contribute.  Many excellent applications 

 unfortunately cannot be funded.

 "The Government's policy for migrants emphasises equality  of rights and equality of opportunities. Our initiative  in expanding the Grant-in-Aid Scheme clearly demonstrates  our commitment to that policy."

 A list of organisations awarded grants is attached.
