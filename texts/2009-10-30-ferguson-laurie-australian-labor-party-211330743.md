 Introduction 

 Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. 

 I would like to acknowledge the Yorta Yorta nation whose land we  meet on today.  

 I am very pleased to be here for the second day of the 2009  FECCA conference.  

 You will be hearing from Ursula Stephens, Parliamentary  Secretary for Social Inclusion and the Voluntary Sector, and the  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Evans.  

 The level of representation here today is a testimony to the  importance of the role FECCA plays. We have come here today to  speak - but also to listen and engage. 

 FECCA is a major partner of Government and an important voice  in the sector - as has been the case for more than 30 years. 

 Since 1945, around 7 million people have come to Australia as  new settlers.  

 Directly and indirectly, FECCA provides a voice for: 

  z the one in four Australians born overseas  

  z to the 43 per cent who have at least one parent born 

  overseas   z to the 16 percent of Australians who speak a different 

  language   z to the Australia that embodies 200 different ancestries and 

  speaks 300 different languages.

  Australia is multilingual, multifaceted and multicultural - we are a  cosmopolitan society.  

  As we have grown we have shifted, adapted and adjusted and this  has made us innovative and competitive.  

  Cultural diversity is something which essentially characterises all  of Australia. 

  We are all part of it - we share the benefits and the challenges -  whether we are migrants, whether our ancestors were, or whether  our belonging in Australia tracks back through the generations. 

  With each new community, Australia takes on a new cultural facet.  

  We expand our cultural horizons, take on new customs, celebrate  new festivals and understand the world from a new angle.  

  What makes us multicultural is that we share our traditions.  

  We share what it is to be Chinese, what it is to be Turkish and  what it is to be Afghani.  

  This makes being an Australian an experience of life long learning  - at times this is challenging, but mostly it is rewarding and  exciting. 

  Our diversity has become our strength. It has become a part our  identity as a nation.  

  There are many factors that underlie our success in managing  constant and extensive demographic change.  

  Chief among them are our settlement services.  

  I came to this portfolio with an acute understanding of the  contribution that migrants make to this country.  

  What I have been re-educated in is an immense appreciation for  the importance of settlement services.  

  Settlement 

  The opportunities provided in the early months and years shape  the contributions our newest citizens will make over a life time.  

  Early intervention and support is critical to building the blocks for  life long participation.  

  It is at the beginning that we lay the foundations for successful  settlement.  

  It is in these services that we unlock the wealth of experience,  skills and knowledge that migration brings to our economy and to  our society.  

  Settlement services are about tools - knowledge of how to enrol in  education and training - understanding the paths to employment -

  and the opportunity to make friendships and social connections.  

  They are about opening up the doors to Government - they help  make sense of a new system, a new language, a new culture, a  new environment and sometimes new technologies, unfamiliar  sounds and strange landscapes.  

  Earlier this year in Adelaide I launched the AUSCO comic book,  One Step at a Time.  

  I will never forget a story told by a young woman from West Africa  who had contributed to the publication.  

  One night, shortly after arriving in Australia the smoke alarm went  off in their house.  

  She described it as the most terrifying experience - they did not  know what it meant or what was happening.  

  She remembers her mother running from the house - too scared to  re-enter. 

  The next day, their case worker explained that it was a smoke  alarm and its purpose was to protect them from fire.  

  Years later, this was one of many anecdotes told by a confident  articulate university student. 

  The story is now in the comic book - so others will not have to wait  on their front lawn.  

  I talk to refugees on a constant basis - however, it is a different  experience to listen to their accounts of the services we provide.  

  IHSS 

  This year in the lead up to the next tender for our Integrated  Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS) we held national  settlement consultations.  

  The last time Government undertook such consultations in this  sector was in the days of Gerry Hand.  

  Between June and August we held: 

  z 17 community and Government consultations; and  

  z 11 focus groups with refugees.  

  Consultations were held in capital cities, as well as some regional  areas, including Albury, Newcastle and of course - Shepparton.  

  We spoke to: 

  z 460 individuals from 210 organisations.  

  z 195 refugees from 18 nationalities.  

  z more than 80 Government agencies.  

  DIAC also released a discussion paper which generated 86 

  Page 3 of 7 Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia (FECCA) Conference

  submissions.  

  Feedback was sought on: the model, accommodation, involvement  of youth, counselling, health, contract regions, regional settlement  and much more.  

  While the consultations were very positive about our services, they  also revealed some gaps around: 

  z social isolation  

  z a lack of youth engagement  

  z problems accessing housing  

  z a lack of pathways to employment and training;  

  z weaknesses in cultural orientation  

  z the timing and model of torture and trauma counselling 

  { most refuges did not want one-on-one counselling in 

  the initial settlement period.  

  Following the consultations, on 25 September in Brisbane I  announced a suite of changes to IHSS.  

  These changes include: 

  z flexibly delivered services through a tailored case 

  management approach;   z a focus on pathways to education and employment;  

  z an emphasis on linkages and collaboration with other 

  settlement and community programs, ethnic organisations  and recreation and social groups;   z a comprehensive national orientation curriculum framework 

  covering a range of topics from health care and nutrition to  family life in Australia;   z looking into innovative housing solutions to address the 

  challenges of affordable accommodation and isolation; and   z and also looking at a special focus on the needs of young 

  people.  

  I have to say, the feedback on our new directions in IHSS and  settlement has been immensely positive.  

  Some changes were expected and others are a reflection of  themes that were raised consistently across states. 

  Youth 

  Youth is an area that the Minister and I are particularly keen to  work on.  

  Nearly 45 percent of people who arrive in Australia under the  offshore program are under the age of 18, and 70 percent are  under the age of 30.  

  The experience of migration for youth is different - young people  rapidly acquire English and quickly adapt to new cultural norms.  

  While this has great advantages, it also places pressure on  families as traditional roles breakdown.  

  Youth also face the challenge of adapting to the Australian school  system, often at a late stage and with little previous history of 

  Page 4 of 7 Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia (FECCA) Conference

  education.  

  It is difficult to imagine how hard it is to fit into such a structured  system - having missed so many years of learning.  

  As part of our approach I have provided seed funding for a new  Multicultural Youth Peak body.  

  One role of this body will be building the capacity of settlement  organisations to work with youth. The new body will also be  developing a multicultural youth strategy.  

  The other issue to come from the consultations was a pressing  need to examine the linkages between our settlement services. 

  Settlement Framework 

  To this end, in September I also announced that the Minister and I  are looking to set out a new settlement framework.  

  The framework will provide a continuum from offshore to onshore  to deliver long term sustainable settlement outcomes. 

  This continuum covers the broad range of settlement services,  including our offshore Australian Cultural Orientation Program  (AUSCO), IHSS, the Settlement Grants Program (SGP), the Adult  Migrant English Program (AMEP), Complex Case Support and  interpreting services. 

  We must ensure these programs work cooperatively to support our  clients on their pathway to independence. 

  The pathway needs to be as seamless as possible.  

  A good example of this need is in the area of cultural orientation.  

  Humanitarian entrants currently access offshore orientation - the  Australian Cultural Orientation (AUSCO).  

  Onshore there are components of orientation delivered through  IHSS, AMEP and the SGP.  

  All these programs need to work together in the best interests of  the client.  

  This means first of all that the information we provide during the  five days offshore through AUSCO needs to be developed and  extended onshore through IHSS.  

  AMEP should be reinforcing messages within an English language  setting, while SGP should look at orientation around longer term,  more complex issues.  

  The Government is also looking at is how settlement services  integrate with broader Government services at the Commonwealth  and also the State level.  

  Planning is important - we need to ensuring services match  migrantâ€™s needs at the appropriate points in time.

  The focus of our initial settlement services should be on providing  individuals with the tools to navigate Government and the job  market and participate in the Australian community.  

  After receiving settlement services, most migrants face a different  set of issues - such as isolation, lack of cultural contact and  access to culturally appropriate services. 

  Building the capacity of communities to come together and to  celebrate their cultural origins and traditions is important for two  reasons.  

  The many thousands of small cultural and ethnic organisations that  populate Australia create a rich cultural life that shapes our identity  as a nation.  

  They also provide support, friendship and a means to express and  celebrate cultural and ethnic traditions.  

  The Minister and I are keen to re-examine how we engage in  community capacity building in the context of the settlement  framework. 

  FECCA is a partner in this process and has played a leadership  role in capacity building - this year they produced a number of  valuable resources including a kit on community leadership. 

  FECCA has also played an important advocacy role drawing to the  attention of Government issues of concern to people from culturally  and linguistically diverse backgrounds.  

  Role of FECCA 

  Going forward, FECCA will have greater responsibilities in  monitoring the provision of - and access to - culturally appropriate  Government services.  

  The Access and Equity Strategy encourages government agencies  to recognise their responsibility to design and deliver their  programs and services to ensure they are available to all eligible  recipients. 

  We have asked FECCA to coordinate the community feedback  section of our Access and Equity strategy.  

  A key part of the strategy involves consultations with communities  about their experiences with the delivery of government services  and FECCA will be facilitating this process. 

  Agencies need to take account of the needs, circumstances and  backgrounds of all their clients, including their cultures, religions  and language abilities.  

  We think FECCA is well placed to assist this process.  

  Conclusion 

  In conclusion, I want to stress that this Government is committed to  building and maintaining effective linkages with our diverse 

  Page 6 of 7 Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia (FECCA) Conference

  

  communities and fostering participation by all in community life. 

  The next year will be an exciting time. With support from the  sector, we will be:  

  z developing the settlement framework,  

  z delivering a multicultural policy  

  z and implementing changes to the IHSS, the AMEP and the 

  Access and Equity Strategy.
