 Howard’s aid still falls short   

 Labor believes the Howard government’s intention to increase Australia’s level of  development assistance is a step in the right direction.   

 However, under the Howard government the aid budget as a percentage of Gross  National Income (GNI) has declined to its lowest level in thirty years, so this increase  comes off a very low level. The increase will still leave Australia in the bottom tier of  developed countries when it comes to development assistance.    

 It is still well short of the 0.5% of GNI that developed countries need to commit to if we  are to make extreme poverty history in our generation.    

 Labor believes the government should commit to increasing Australia’s development  assistance to 0.5% of GNI as quickly as circumstances permit.     

 “The Australian people are a very generous people, as evidenced by the overwhelming  response to the Boxing Day tsunami. Australians understand that assisting those in need  is not only the right thing to do, it is also in our national interest, especially given the 

 security problems that exist in the world today,” said Bob Sercombe, Shadow Minister  for Overseas Aid and Pacific Island Affairs.    

 “Unfortunately, we know that when it comes to aid commitments the Howard  government is good at the big announcements and the bells and whistles - but is pretty  bad at the follow-through.   

 “When it comes to the follow-through, there’s lots of smoke and mirrors. The Howard  government announced a billion dollars in tsunami assistance, which we all welcomed,  but only a very small part of this has been spent in Aceh so far.   

 “The other critical issue is, what will the money actually be spent on? Will it actually be  spent on reducing poverty? Or will the government continue to use the aid program for  disgraceful purposes such as housing asylum seekers on Nauru? 

 

 “Mr Howard has rightly emphasised the importance of developing countries promoting  good governance and transparency. But here’s my challenge to Mr Howard - how about 

 much more transparency in the government’s aid program? In this year’s budget, over  $170 million of our aid is being spent on government departments other than AusAID.   This is money that, according to the government’s own budget papers is ‘not attributable  to a particular country or region.’ What’s it being spent on then - stationery supplies?   

 “So until we see the Howard government actually follow through on this announcement,  until we see what the money will actually be spent on, and until the government  introduces more transparency into the aid program, the risk is that this latest  announcement will just be more smoke and mirrors,” said Mr Sercombe.
