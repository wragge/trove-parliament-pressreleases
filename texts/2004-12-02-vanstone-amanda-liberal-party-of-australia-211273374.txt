 Decisions Handed Down on Nauru

 VPS 142/2004

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, announced  that the decisions from the reassessment of Iraqi asylum seeker cases on Nauru would be handed down today.

 ‘I announced on 29 August 2004 that my Department would reassess Australia’s Iraqi caseload on Nauru as a  result of the changing environment in Iraq and other developments,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘Following my announcement, my Department agreed to a UNHCR request to extend its reassessment to  include the Iraqis in the UNHCR caseload on Nauru.

 ‘My department has now finalised its reassessments for 41 of the Iraqis in Nauru.

 ‘27 people have received positive outcomes and now been assessed as refugees by Australia. This group  includes 11 people from the UNHCR caseload. This group comprises 5 families including 10 children.

 ‘Fourteen people, including four people from the UNHCR caseload, were again found not to be refugees.  Decisions for a further two people are still under consideration. A further four Iraqis previously found not to  be refugees by the UNHCR did not wish have their cases re-assessed by Australia and their status remains  unchanged. 

 ‘Those found to be refugees will continue to receive support, including accommodation, food, clothing and  medical care while arrangements are made to resettle them elsewhere. 

 ‘Australia has made it clear all along that it will take its fair share of refugees needing resettlement from the  offshore processing centres. A number of other countries have participated in the resettlement of refugees  from this caseload. The Iraqis in Australia’s caseload now being approved as refugees will be offered  resettlement in Australia. The UNHCR has undertaken to seek resettlement options for those approvals in their  caseload.

 ‘Those people who have again been confirmed as non-refugees should now accept the outcome and return to  their home country as quickly as possible.

 ‘The outcome of the reassessment reflects the Government’s commitment to assess the effect of changing  circumstances on the protection claims of individuals.’
