  SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT  Queensland Democrats Senator 

  FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS 

  Democrats Immigration spokesperson Senator Andrew Bartlett today introduced his 8‘h Private  Senator’s Bill aimed at fixing flaws in the Migration Act. 

  “The Bill provides a better system of protection for people who do not meet the narrow criteria of the  Refugee Convention, but who still have valid humanitarian reasons why they should not be returned to  their home countries.” 

  “The Edmund Rice Centre recently released its finding into cases where failed refugees sent back to  their countries of origin were killed. These tragedies indicate that the current system is failing and other  options must be explored.” 

  “Currently people have to rely on Ministers exercising their discretion, which has been found to have  serious flaws being inconsistent, inefficient and non-transparent.” 

  ‘Complementary protection is already used in many other countries including the United States, the  United Kingdom and Germany. Members of the European Union are now required to introduce a  co m p I e m e n t a r y protection reg i m e. ” 

  “This system will provide a transparent, clear and efficient program which will ensure that Australia  meets its international and humanitarian obligations and will be a significant improvement on our  current system.” 

  “The introduction of my Complementary Protection Visa Bill is part of a suite of private Senator’s Bills I  have been introducing to remove the more offensive and discriminatory aspects of the Migration Act as  well as introducing more humane and more efficient alternatives.” 

  “It is nearly five years since the Government guillotined through its raft of migration legislation sparked  by the Tampa event that removed fundamental rights from asylum seekers fleeing persecution,”  Senator Bartlett said.
