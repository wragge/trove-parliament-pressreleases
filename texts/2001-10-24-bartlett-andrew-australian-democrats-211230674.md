 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 24 October 2001  MEDIA RELEASE                          01/656

 UN’s statements show that ‘queue’ for refugees doesn’t work The revelation by the United Nations that some of the drowned asylum seekers had already been assessed as genuine refugees is categorical proof that the so-called ‘queue’ for refugees doesn't work, according to the Australian Democrats.

 Democrats' Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said this fact demonstrates once and for all that there is no workable queue for refugees.

 “No person who had already been assessed as a refugee would risk their life unless they still had no serious prospect of resettlement,” Senator Bartlett said.

 Recent revelations in the media also indicated that Australia had previously refused an offer, through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), for other countries to take the Tampa refugees.

 "Once again, it is clear that the Government and the Opposition are more interested in domestic political advantage than they are in finding a real solution to this problem."

 The Democrats also condemned the statement by Mr Ruddock blaming the Senate for the drowning of these desperate people.  "The Senate's role is to protect the rule of law and to ensure legislation that is passed is fair and workable.  None of the Government's legislation has passed this test."

 "Needless to say, comments this morning by Pauline Hanson calling on Australia to cease all aid to Indonesia would be surest way to increase the death toll and dramatically increase the number of people trying to reach Australia rather than seek assessment in Indonesia."

 "As UNHCR representative, Raymond Hall indicated, this tragedy which has occurred is in part due to a lack of solutions for refugees."

 "It is time for Australia to focus on working with the world to get a real queue working, rather than just trying to put up a wall around our nation and degrade our humanity in the process."   ENDS
