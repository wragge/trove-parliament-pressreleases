 DJG 220/86 COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT GRANTS FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF

 Emergency relief services in Queensland will receive grants  totalling $1,033,000 from the Commonwealth Government.

 Details of the grants were announced today by the acting  Minister for Community Services,  Mr Brian Howe.

 Mr Howe said that the funds include an amount of $164,000 for  55 welfare agencies catering for the special needs of  Aboriginal people.

 Emergency relief assists people who need financial support in  times of crisis.

 The Commonwealth Government makes funds available to community  and welfare organisations to supplement the traditional State  Government and voluntary sector services.

 Mr Howe said that he had approved the grants after receiving  advice from the Queensland Advisory Committee on Emergency  Relief. This Committee takes into account such factors as the  needs of regions as well as the suitability of the agencies 

 themselves for the task of distributing funds before making its 

 recommendations.

 During this financial year the Commonwealth Government is 

 providing $6.32 million to welfare agencies throughout 

 Australia for emergency relief.
