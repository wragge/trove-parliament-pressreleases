 Brothers Reunited With Their Mother MPS 66/2002

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, announced today that two brothers who escaped from immigration detention, were reunited with their mother at the Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre today.

 The brothers left Melbourne on a chartered aircraft from Essendon airport at 8.45 this morning accompanied by two Australasian Correctional Management officers.

 On arrival at Woomera the boys were taken to the medical centre and examined by nursing staff and a psychologist.

 The Minister said that while the Victorian Department of Human Services decided not to send anyone to Maribyrnong to talk to the brothers they had been closely consulted and were satisfied as to the welfare of the boys. They will liaise with their South Australian counterparts to follow-up after the boys' arrival at Woomera.

 Immigration history of family

 The Minister said that contrary to claims reported in the media, information regarding the father's alleged fraudulent asylum claim was already in the public arena.

 "On 12 April this year my Department issued a notice of intent to cancel the father's Temporary Protection Visa on the grounds that he was actually a Pakistani national who had been working as a plumber in Pakistan, not an Afghan national as he claimed," Mr Ruddock said.

 "The man subsequently lodged a Federal Court application seeking to compel disclosure of information in relation to his alleged fraud."

 Mr Ruddock also pointed out that the family had been separated by its own actions.

 "The father arrived, without his wife and children, in October 1999 and was granted a Temporary Protection Visa in August 2000. His family did not follow until January 2001.

 "When a person is granted a Temporary Protection Visa after being assessed by the Department, it does not mean that the person's relatives, arriving separately, are automatically guaranteed a visa.

 "Visa applications are considered on a case by case basis against the relevant criteria.

 "The man's wife and children were found by my Department not to be refugees, the family then appealed that negative decision at the Refugee Review Tribunal which again found them not to be refugees.

 "Since that time they have sought further review of that decision. Until a further decision is made the family remain unlawful non-citizens and are required by law to remain in detention."

 The Minister also said that the boys' father has made no contact with his Department to be reunited with his sons.

 Rebuttal of brothers' claims about conditions in Woomera

 The Minister also explained that claims made about the provision of education to children at Woomera fail to acknowledge that decisions in relation to a child accessing available educational opportunities rest with the parents of the child.

 "Parents are ultimately responsible for ensuring the school attendance of their children. My Department has very limited powers to compel detainee parents to ensure that their children attend school programs that are offered or to compel children themselves to attend and there are no readily available sanctions for non-attendance.

 "Furthermore, just as in the Australian community children who disrupt the education of others are subject to disciplinary action, including suspension for short periods.

 "I can say that these boys had a very high attendance rate at school until a hunger strike in June of this year. School records show that they are eager participants in all aspects of schooling.

 "Claims that children are required to pay for toys are untrue. Games, books, toys and other items are provided to children according to their ages. Additional appropriate toys donated by members of the public are also distributed to children. As children have access to toys and other items, there would be no need for children to pay for them," the Minister said.

 Mr Ruddock reiterated how pleased he was to see the boys returned safe and well.

 "We all feel sympathy for young children who are forced by their parents into perilous journeys and end up in immigration detention through no fault of their own.

 "I can assure people that in applying Australian law we do so with both integrity and compassion."
