 Senator Andrew Bartlett   Leader of the Australian Democrats  Spokesperson for Defence and Veterans Affairs  12 May 2003                      MEDIA RELEASE                                    03/299                   

 

 Defence Budget is now a War Budget   

 The Government is increasingly spending defence dollars on waging war rather than keeping the  peace, the Leader of the Australian Democrats Senator Andrew Bartlett said today. 

 The increase in defence spending is due to the Howard Government’s shift in focus from defending  Australia to military actions outside our region and the subsequent change in capability needs.  

 “If they are spending up on equipment like anti-tank missiles, that is not to defend Australia or even  for likely low-level conflicts in our region. The Government’s priorities and plans are for acting  with the United States in going to war against other countries. 

 “The use of Australia’s military for regime change and attempts to disarm foreign countries is a  shift away from a diplomatic and multilateral approach to these issues. 

 “The Government has admitted to spending $750 million on the war on Iraq, but the real cost is  likely to be closer to $1 billion. In a Defence Budget of around $15 billion that is a considerable  outlay.  

 “At the same time the Government is refusing to meet a potential need for peace-keeping forces  both in Iraq and in our region. The next East Timor could be around the corner and Australia must  have the capabilities for situations where the United States is unlikely to help. 

 “The Democrats expect and support an increase in Intelligence costs in the Defence Budget. We  also expect, but do not support, an increase in Operations costs. 

  “It is the Government's misuse of defence funds and forces, rather than the level of funding, that is  of concern to the Democrats,” Senator Bartlett said.   

 “The Government has also wasted tens of millions just on the defence force costs of turning away  asylum seekers at sea.   

 “Further, there is a clear history of poor decision making and management in acquiring defence  equipment and the Government keeps throwing good money after bad.   

  “The Democrats support a strong defence capability, recognising there are potential regional  demands. The Democrats would also like to see Australia's defence and foreign policy be more  independent and less reliant on the United States and recognise that will cost. We accept that the  Defence Budget is unlikely to drop as a percentage of GDP.”   

 Senator Bartlett said that over recent years the amount of real information given about the Defence  Budget had dropped. “There is less transparency in defence spending than there used to be. There is  more rhetoric about security but less detail about where the funds are going. Each year we are  spending more on defence but the actual Budget Papers are getting smaller.”
