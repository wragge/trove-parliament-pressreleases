 Media release 

 Bowen dodges bushfire question  

 Wednesday 27 October 2010 

 In Question Time today the Minister for Immigration showed his complete lack of  knowledge on the affects of the decision to establish a detention centre at Inverbrackie.  

 The Minister was asked a question which specifically requested detail on how the safety of  the 400 asylum seekers would be assured during catastrophic bushfire conditions and he  point blank refused to answer.  

 This just proves how important it is for a Parliamentary committee to be established to  investigate this and other concerns of the community.  

 The actions of the government to shut down a debate this morning on the need for a  Parliamentary inquiry showed their complete lack of respect for the Adelaide hills  community.  

 Minister Bowen also indicated in Question Time today that he would visit and speak to  ‘stakeholders’ on this issue.  

 I call on the Minister to subject himself to a community forum and not just appear before a  handpicked group. This is the least the Minister can do.
