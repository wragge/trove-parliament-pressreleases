 was being given to surveillance requirements essential to safeguard Aust­

 ralia against unauthorised entry and to maintain the effective standards 

 of quarantine xdiich had prevailed in Australia* '

 There were the important considerations of protecting Australia against 

 the introduction of diseases which could tin*eaten Australian livestock 

 industries and agriculture»

 Any necessary changes in requirements for surveillan.ee arid patrol would 

 be considered urgently by the Interdepartmental Committee on Surveillance.

 It was essential that entry to Australia was controlled — - but any action 

 taken to ensure this had to be leavened with humanity and compassion for 

 the plight of genuine refugees» ·

 The Ministers said the despatch of an additional task—force was to assist 

 the orderly international processing of refugees in the Malaysia-Singapore area 

 and thereby avoid.the need for genuine refugees to make the hazardous voyage

 In addition to the task-force, the selection team in Thailand had been 

 strengthened by another officer from Australia. This would speed up selection 

 and processing of refugees. '
