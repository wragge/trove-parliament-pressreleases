 Second Regional Ministerial Conference on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons  and Related Transnational Crime   

 The Foreign Ministers of Australia and Indonesia successfully co-Chaired the second Regional  Ministerial Conference on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational  Crime, in Bali from 28-30 April.  The Australian delegation was led by the Minister for  Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ruddock and included the Minister for  Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison.  The Conference was attended by 28 Ministers from 32  countries across the Asia-Pacific region, as well as the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees, representatives from the International Organisation for Migration and a further 13  international agencies and representatives from 14 observer countries.   

 There has been significant progress made since the first Regional Ministerial Conference in  February 2002.  The two Ad Hoc Experts’ Groups established by that Conference have achieved  concrete outcomes including the development, by China and Australia, of model legislation to  criminalise people smuggling and trafficking, the strengthening of cooperation between law  enforcement agencies and the mechanisms to facilitate information exchange.  Such mechanisms  included the establishment of a website, launched by the Australian and Indonesian Foreign  Ministers, at the opening of the Conference in Bali.   

 The Conference accepted the Plans of Action of the two Ad Hoc Experts’ Groups which had been  established by that Conference.  The Plans include future work on public awareness, returns,  legislation, law enforcement, border management and improved measures to verify identity and  procedures for document examination.  Ministers agreed that officials would convene a meeting in  approximately one year’s time to review the implementation of the Plans of Action and report  back to Indonesia and Australia as the co-Chairs.  Ministers agreed that the Ad Hoc Experts’  Groups would continue, for the time being, to be chaired by Thailand and New Zealand.  There  was unanimous support for a further Ministerial meeting in two to three year’s time to ensure that  progress was maintained in tackling people smuggling, trafficking in persons and related  transnational crime.     

 The Bali process has boosted legal and enforcement cooperation in the region.  The work  undertaken over the last year provides an excellent basis on which to build further cooperation in  combating other forms of transnational crime including money laundering, terrorist financing and  drug trafficking.     

 The co-hosting of the Conference is another example of the excellent cooperation between  Indonesia and Australia and of our commitment to working together with regional partners to  tackle serious issues affecting us all.
