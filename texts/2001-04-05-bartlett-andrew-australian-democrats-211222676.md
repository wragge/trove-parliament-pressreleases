 Press Release Dated: 5 Apr 2001 Press Release Number: 01/216 Portfolio: Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

 Ruddock’s heavy hand will make detention centre conditions worse It is time for the ALP to take a stand on human rights in detention centres and join the Democrats in opposing the Government’s proposed Bill to worsen conditions in detention centres, the Democrats said today.

 Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock has introduced a Bill that would increase the penalties for those involved in riots in detention centres and give guards the right to strip search detainees.

 “The Bill is contrary to all the recommendations that are coming out of independent inquiries into detention centres,” said Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Democrats’ immigration spokesperson.

 “Riots are caused by asylum seekers’ frustration, fear and isolation. Minister Ruddock’s heavy-handed approach would not calm things down but make conditions worse.

 “The Flood report recommended initiatives like cross-cultural training for guards and using names not numbers for detainees.

 “A recent Human Rights Commissioner report criticised the Government for not informing asylum seekers of their rights, slow access to advice, arbitrary detention and improper use of separation detention,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “There is also evidence of asylum seekers in detention being beaten or drugged.

 “This is a challenge to the Labor Party who have fallen in behind the Government in creating inhumane conditions for asylum seekers.

 “These are not jails they are centres where families live, sometimes for years. These sort of excessive measures are not appropriate in the circumstances.

 The Government needs to rethink their whole approach on mandatory detention. The present policy of mandatory detention almost inevitably contravenes basic human rights,” Senator Bartlett said.

 “Australia is unique in the world for locking up all asylum seekers for indefinite periods of time. Having asylum seekers monitored but living in the community would be cheaper for the taxpayer and a lot more humane.”
