 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Thursday, 17 January 2013   

 Another baby born into indefinite detention   

 A young mother named Ranjini who is facing indefinite detention in Australia has given birth to her  third child; another innocent new-born who will be detained despite having committed no crime.   

 “What should be a joyous time for Ranjini and her family is no doubt tinged with despair as she  knows her children face unreasonable and lengthy detention,” the Greens immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Ranjini has been held in the Villawood Detention Centre after being thrown into a legal black hole  when she arrived in Australia and now, because of this government’s inhumane policies, her  innocent children have been too.   

 “The government needs to end this cruel regime of indefinite detention.   

 “Because of Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott’s race to the bottom there are people, including children,  all over Australia who are being detained indefinitely.   

 “As a caring and compassionate nation, Australia should not turn its back on vulnerable refugees and  the government should choose to save billions of tax payer dollars by closing its offshore detention  centres.   

 “It is never appropriate to lock up children in immigration detention, let alone indefinitely, arbitrarily  and in island prisons, and the current immigration mess needs to be fixed.”
