 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Tuesday, 4 November 2014    

 Brutal Nauru assaults continue on resettled  refugees    

 The Australian Greens have called for an end to the doomed policy of resettlement on Nauru  following a series of attacks that have put the lives of refugees, including children, at risk.    

 “The Minister’s callous blame shifting has been appalling,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson,  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “Children are being beaten on the streets in Nauru and the Minister who put them there couldn’t  care less.    

 “These attacks show that there is no prospect of resettlement on Nauru. The children who are found  to be refugees need to be brought to Australia now, before it’s too late.”    

 On Saturday, a refugee was hospitalised after being pelted with stones and beaten by a group of  local men on the island. That attack followed a similar one just a week before, where a group of boys  were hospitalised after being threatened and beaten by locals.    

 “Roaming gangs are targeting the men, women and children who the Australian government  dumped on Nauru,” Senator Hanson-Young said.    

 “When I visited the centre, the conditions inside were appalling. It’s now clear that life on the  outside is just as bad for the children Scott Morrison has abandoned on Nauru.    

 “These attacks will continue and it’s time to recognise that resettlement is unfeasible. These  refugees, including women and unaccompanied children, need to be brought to Australia  immediately.”
