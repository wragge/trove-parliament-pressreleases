 Bartlett Challenges Hansons Senate Pretensions

 Queensland Democrat Senator Andrew Bartlett said today that confirmation from Pauline Hanson that  she will contest the upcoming federal election as a Queensland Senate candidate is a challenge that he  is more than ready to meet.    

 "I defeated Pauline Hanson when she ran for the Senate in the 2001 federal election in Queensland and  have been the strongest voice against her attacks on Indigenous people, refugees and migrants,"  Senator Bartlett said.   

 "The Democrats are already primed for a big effort in Queensland at the federal election, and are  determined to repeat our success in 2001 in seeing off Ms Hanson and holding our seat.   

 "Ms Hanson promises more of the same, as her inflammatory comments in December about the  dangers of allowing Muslim and African migrants into Australia demonstrate.    

 "People shouldn't treat Pauline Hanson's candidacy as a side issue. If she were to be elected, there is a  real prospect she would share the balance of power in the Senate.   

 "The future composition of the Senate will be a key issue at the federal election, alongside whether Mr  Howard or Mr Rudd is elected Prime Minister.   

 "Whoever is in government, it is crucial that the Senate is not controlled by any one party or group, and  that those with the balance of power have a proven record of being effective, reasonable and  independent.    

 "I've spent a large part of my last 9 years in the Senate fighting to promote unity and recognition of the  benefits of cultural diversity and reconciliation with Indigenous Australians. It's often been a battle to get  a balanced perspective across on these issues, when divisive statements tend to get more focus.   

 "The Queensland Democrats will continue to stand against Pauline Hanson and her divisive policies,  that can only bring harm to our state and the nation," concluded Senator Bartlett.
