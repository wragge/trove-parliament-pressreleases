 RUDDOCK ON OFFENSIVE OVER UN GROUP’S CREDIBILITY

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock today said credibility questions could be raised after comments on detention from a visiting United Nations Committee.

 “It appears the members of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention have taken at face value, claims from advocacy groups that there have been several confirmed suicides in detention,” Mr Ruddock said.

 “The claims from advocates that there have been six suicides in detention and that this means the rate is far higher than the national average have already been shown to be wrong.

 “While it is regrettable that anyone has died, to date there have been seven deaths in detention but there have been no coronial findings that any of the deaths were as a result of suicide.

 “Advice has been received by my department on two of the deaths and the findings attributed both to pre-existing chronic medical conditions.

 “At least two of the other deaths also appear to be related to pre-existing conditions, although  there  has  been  no  formal  report  on  their  causes,  nor  on  the  other  three deaths.

 Only  one  of  the  deaths  involved  an  unlawful  boat  arrival,  while  the  others  involved people located during compliance operations and in one case, a man being removed because of criminal convictions.

 “If the UN Group is going to accept without question, assertions from advocates, their final report will be flawed and have little credibility,” Mr Ruddock said.
