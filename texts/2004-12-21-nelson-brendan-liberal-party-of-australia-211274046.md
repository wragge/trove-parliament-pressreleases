 Media Release

 EXPERT ADVISORY GROUP ANNOUNCED-MEASURING QUALITY AND IMPACT IN RESEARCH

 21 December, 2004 MIN 1034/04 

 I am today announcing details of the Expert Advisory Group that will work on the  development of a Research Quality Framework for publicly funded research. The  Framework was one of the new measures announced by the Government in May 2004 as  part of the Backing Australia’s Ability - Building our Future through Science and  Innovation strategy.

 Chair of the Expert Advisory Group will be Professor Sir Gareth Roberts, President of  Wolfson College in Oxford. Sir Gareth is an acknowledged expert in research quality  assessment. He is currently the Chair of the Higher Education Funding Council for  England (HEFCE) Board’s Research Committee, and led the 2003 United Kingdom wide  review of research assessment.

 The Expert Advisory Group comprises national and international experts experienced in  the assessment and moderation of research quality and impact as well as the  implementation of assessment processes. Between them they represent universities,  publicly funded research agencies and Australian industry.

 The aim of the Framework is to measure the quality of research conducted in Australia’s  universities and Publicly Funded Research Agencies (PFRAs), as well as benefits of  research to the wider community. This initiative will develop the basis for a more  consistent and comprehensive approach to assessing the quality and impact of publicly  funded research.

 This financial year, over $3 billion will be invested by the Howard Government in  research and research training in Australia. The Government is committed to ensuring  that these resources are directed to areas of research excellence and public benefit. 

 As part of its examination and assessment during 2005 of the quality and impact of 

 research in Australia’s universities and PFRAs, the Expert Advisory Group will undertake  wide-ranging consultations, release an issues paper and hold a major stakeholder forum. 

 The Advisory Group will also provide a report by the end of 2005 that sets out a  preferred model/s for assessing research quality.

 Attached is the list of the Expert Advisory Group members and the Terms of Reference.  More information can be obtained from DEST’s web site www.dest.gov.au/resqual.
