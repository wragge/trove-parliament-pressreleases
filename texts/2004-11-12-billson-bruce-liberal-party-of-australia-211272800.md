 MEDIA RELEASE 

 The Hon Bruce Billson MP  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs        

 AA 04 075                                                                                      Friday 12 November 2004 

 

 Continued Australian support for Bangladesh flood victims   

 Australia will provide up to $1 million in additional aid to help those most affected by recent  floods in Bangladesh, the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Bruce  Billson, announced today.   

 ‘Our further contribution will support the “food for work” programs as part of ongoing  emergency operations set up by the World Food Programme (WFP), following devastating  floods in July and September,’ Mr Billson said.   

 ‘The programs will create jobs for around 400,000 people to restore infrastructure, including  rural roads and embankments. In exchange for work, the WFP will distribute food to high-risk groups, including pregnant women, nursing mothers and more than one million children  at risk of malnutrition.    

 ‘For Bangladesh’s northern districts the next two months will be critical as food supplies run  out ahead of the rice harvest in December and January.   

 ‘Australia’s humanitarian response to Bangladesh is part of our sustained aid engagement to  help people in need throughout South Asia. Working through the WFP, Australia is the  largest single donor of food aid to Bangladesh.   

 ‘This latest emergency humanitarian contribution brings Australia’s assistance in the wake  of the floods to $25.8 million. In August, we provided 67,000 tonnes of wheat to a United  Nations Flash Appeal and $600,000 to international agencies and local NGOs for the  rebuilding of schools and the provision of water purification tablets and other emergency  supplies.    

 ‘The worst flooding in Bangladesh for six years, has claimed more than 760 lives, damaged  at least two million homes and destroyed more than a million hectares of crops.   

 ‘The Australian Government is committed to an effective, ongoing aid program in the region  and also responding to disasters to help communities in need,’ Mr Billson said.    

 In 2004-2005, Australia increased overseas aid funding by nearly ten per cent to an  estimated $2.133 billion and augmented by an estimated $14 million to $146 million, our  international humanitarian, emergency and refugee programs.
