 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS LABOR RE-WRITES HISTORY

 The ALP continues to misrepresent its policy in relation to illegal arrivals.

 They are now claiming that the reason there were so few illegal arrivals during their time in office was because they had an agreement with Indonesia to return illegal boat arrivals. This is simply untrue.

 Mr Beazley said yesterday: "That requires negotiation with the Indonesians to return to the sorts of positions we had when Labor was in office." (Kim Beazley, Channel 7, Sunrise ­ 7am, 11/10/01)

 Simon Crean continued the re-write when he said "Now, all I’m saying in this John is that we can’t establish diplomatic relations overnight. We had the understandings with Indonesia about the South Chinese boat people, to take them back, to process them there, to return them to China." (Simon Crean, Cairns radio ­ ABC 11/10/01)

 Kim Beazley finished off by saying: "The two things that are now clearly necessary are the two things that only Labor will provide. One is a coast guard.....and the second is an agreement with the Indonesians. Sit down and negotiate an agreement with the Indonesians so that we have the performance that we used to have when Labor was in office, which has collapsed over the last three years

 "..he (John Howard) sent three ministers to Indonesia to try and negotiate the solution that the Labor Party used to have. And he failed. The solution is that they get sent back to Indonesia...to simply restore what we had before John Howard."

 "We had an agreement in place and John Howard knows that which is why he tried to get it himself. He failed."

 "They did not bother coming before because they knew the Indonesians wouldn't let them go." (Kim Beazley, Steve Price 3AW , 4pm 11/10/01)

 Mr Sciacca: "(Laurie Brereton and I would go) straight over to Indonesia and try to see if we couldn’t negotiate the same arrangement we had with them prior to 1996…" (Con Sciacca, 6PR Perth Radio ­ 4.18pm, 10/10/01)

 Mr Crean: "Our aim is to have a complete strategy, like in 1994 we held talks with the Indonesian Government and the illegals were sent back through the South China Sea." (Simon Crean, 4MW Torres Strait Radio ­ 8.55am 11/10/01)

  

 This is all simply untrue.

 The Labor Government never had a government-to-government agreement with Indonesia to return non-Indonesian nationals who had arrived in Australia unlawfully by boat, back to Indonesia, or through the South China Sea.*

 Its time for Labor to stop rewriting the past.

 * The Indonesians agreed to accept back one Vietnamese boat, that had departed the Refugee Camp in Galang Island, as part of the arrangements put in place by the UNHCR relating to the Comprehensive Plan of Action.
