 NEW REFUGEES WELCOMED - SO CLOSE BUT STILL SO FAR TO GO   

 The Opposition joins the Government in welcoming yesterday’s arrival of Liberian  refugees in Melbourne.   

 Laurie Ferguson, Shadow Minister for Immigration stated:   

 “We welcome the Government’s granting of these humanitarian visas, and particularly  the orientation towards Africa, which has a history of immense abuse of Human Rights.  Places like Sierra Leone, Toga, Sudan, and Congo face major crises with the future being  uncertain for many.”    

 “With this orientation by the Government for the refugee intake, the real issues of  specialised settlement services for these new arrivals must be adequately addressed.   There must be greater emphasis on where they came from, what they have gone through  and how best we can help them become absorbed into the broader Australian culture and  community.    

 “In the last budget, the Government increased settlement expenditure, but unfortunately  this was largely to cater for the actual increase in the number of humanitarian visas. The  Government should be mindful that many Africans have arrived here after years of  displacement, destruction, and desperation - including minimal education, income, and  divided families. This in itself represents a particular challenge for the current settlement  process. The Government must ensure that they do not become a marginalised minority.  Currently there is a strong link between African refugees and unemployment.”    

 Laurie Ferguson also made the point that:   

 “The video- A New Country, A new Life- is a good initiative for introducing the refugees  to what they can expect when starting their life in Australia. However, it is only in  Arabic, Dari and French. As much as possible it should be translated into the appropriate  languages for the African refugees, to facilitate positive and effective integration.”     

 “It is crucial that in relation to the African arrivals, the Government duly considers the  specialised settlement needs stemming from the general settlement process. This will 

 better equip them for their new life with stability, certainty and opportunity,” concluded  Laurie Ferguson.
