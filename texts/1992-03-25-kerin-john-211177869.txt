 	 25 March 1992 Date: Australian aid for displaced Cambodians

 Australia will provide $2.7 million to assist displaced Cambodians, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, John Kerin, announced today.

 The funds will be channelled through the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). They will assist more than 350,000 Cambodians living in the Thai border camps who will soon return to Cambodia.

 "Repatriation is a complex and difficult task. Poor health conditions and the large number of landmines pose real threats for the returnees," Mr Kerin said.

 "Australia contributed approximately $1.3 million last October for the extensive preparations being made for repatriation. Further funds are now needed to implement the program.

 "Australia's assistance will ease the transition for Cambodians making the journey back to their country. The funds will also assist them while they await repatriation."

 The funds will be channelled as follows: â¢ $1.3 million for repatriation and reintegration of displaced Cambodians through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the World Food Programme â¢ $800,000 to the United Nations Border Relief Operation (UNBRO) for

 Cambodians in the Thai border camps â¢ $600,000 to the ICRC for programs both in the Thai border camps and inside Cambodia

 Australian emergency assistance to Cambodia is administered by AIDAB, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau. * * * * * * CANBERRA For further information contact AIDAB Public Affairs: Wendy Levy, (06) 276 4966 or A.H (06) 247 8920. Tony Melville, (06) 276 4960.
