 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales 

 

 New West Papuan asylum seekers should be  assessed in Australia 

 

 Senator Nettle, 9th May 2006   

 Greens Immigration Spokesperson, Senator Kerry Nettle, today called on the  government to process any asylum claim from the West Papuans who have been  detained in the Torres Strait according to Australia's obligations under international  law.    

 "If these three men are claiming asylum their claims should be processed in the same  way as anyone who seeks asylum in Australia," Senator Nettle said.    

 "These men should be dealt with in Australia by Australians according to Australian  laws.    

 "This is a test case for the Howard government. Any moves to take these men to  Nauru or other place of offshore detention will be seen in Australia as appeasing the  Indonesian government.    

 "The United Nations High Commission for Refugees, Amnesty International and The  Greens have all condemned the government's proposed changes to the migration laws  which are intended to target asylum seekers from West Papua.    

 "Asylum seekers from West Papua will continue as long as human rights abuses and  economic and environmental injustices are allowed to continue in West Papua.    

 "The Australian government should be seeking constructive engagement with  Indonesia to prevent human rights abuses instead of trying to prevent asylum seekers  from accessing Australian protection.
