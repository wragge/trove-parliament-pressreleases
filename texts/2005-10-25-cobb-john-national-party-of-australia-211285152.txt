 Media Centre  Minister to Visit Canterbury MRC 

 25 October 2005 

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, John Cobb, will meet  the people who work tirelessly with newly arrived migrants and refugees  when he visits the Canterbury-Bankstown Migrant Resource Centre 

 (MRC) today. 

 ‘Migrant Resource Centres are an important ‘one stop shop’ for  thousands of migrants and refugees who are successfully resettled every  year in Australia,’ Mr Cobb said. 

 ‘Australia’s settlement services are amongst the world’s most generous  and the government is committed to ensuring these people have the  support and assistance they need to build a successful life in their new  home,’ Mr Cobb said. 

 The Canterbury-Bankstown MRC has received more than $300 000 in  funding from the Australian government in the 2004-05 financial year. It  also receives more than $500 000 under the Community Settlement  Services Scheme in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and  Indigenous Affairs. 

 ‘Migrant Resource Centres create a vital link between the incoming  settlers and their new community by providing assistance in a variety of  areas including language skills, housing and employment. 

 ‘Through this support, migrants and refugees develop a sense of  belonging and are able to contribute to their community socially and  economically,’ Mr Cobb said. 

 The Minister will visit the Canterbury-Bankstown Migrant Resource  Centre, Evaline St in Campsie on 25 October at 2:15pm.
