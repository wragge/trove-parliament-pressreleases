 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Monday, 15 July 2013   

 Manus failure has to be addressed    

 The failure of the Manus Island oversight committee to ever meet is a clear indictment on the  Australian Government and yet another sign that the island prison needs to be shut down, the  Australian Greens have said.    

 "The revelation that the government's oversight committee has never met shows that Labor were  never serious about making sure the treatment of refugees on Manus Island was humane or in line  with international standards," the Greens' immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young  said.    

 "The government has shown contempt for ensuring adequate transparency of it's offshore detention  camps that are costing Australian tax payers billions of dollars every year. 

 "The government seems intent on hiding what is really going on inside the Manus camp, banning  media access and now ensuring a lack of attention by their hand-picked oversight committee.     

 "When I visited the Manus Island prison earlier this year, it was clear that there was insufficient  planning and management.     

 "It is now clear that the Parliament and the Australian people were misled on how the centre would  be run and overseen and it is time for it to be shut down.    

 "The Greens will stand up for what is right and will work to protect vulnerable people in our region  now and into the future."
