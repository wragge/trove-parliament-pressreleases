 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 Vanstone negligent over farcical and negligent deportations 

 19th Jan 05 

 Senator Kerry Nettle today accused Minister Vanstone of dangerous  incompetence over the handling of section 417 ministerial  intervention process and recent deportations.    

 "The Greens are deeply concerned that the Minster has bungled the  section 417 humanitarian application of an Iranian journalist and  writer, Ardeshir Gholipour, who now faces deportation," said  Senator Nettle.    

 "The Writers in Prison Committee of PEN International has written a  very strong letter expressing its concern for Mr Gholipour should he  be deported to Iran. It seems the Minister has failed to take into  account the PEN letter when making this decision.    

 Mr Gholipour spent 21 months in Iran's notorious Evin Political  Prison for distributing pamphlets for the Iran Freedom Movement.  His work as a dissident journalist and writer forced him to flee Iran  for fear of his life.    

 "I understand that when Mr Gholipour heard about the rejection he  took an overdose and was taken to hospital. Does the Minister  really think this is how Australia should be treating the brave people  who fight for democracy in Iran and seek our protection?    

 This latest failure to manage the humanitarian visa application  process fairly comes hard on the heels of the Bakhtiari deportation  fiasco.    

 "The Bakhtiari family which the Minister deported to Pakistan have  now gone back to Afghanistan were they always claimed to be from.    

 "The government has effectively sent a family, including small  children, back to a place where they face persecution," said Senator  Nettle.    

 "The Minister should be held responsible for their safety and an  inquiry should be held into why she has made such a grave error, 

 particularly when there was so much evidence, and she was warned  by so many Australians that the Bakhtiaris were indeed Afghani and  in need of protection.    

 "I am also very concerned by reports that the Minister has handed  the decision making process over section 417 applications to her  junior Minister, who is apparently rejecting them at a rapid rate.    

 "People's lives hang in the balance with section 417 applications and  the Minister should treat them with appropriate respect or she is not  fit for the job. Whether she is making the decisions or not, she is  ultimately responsible for the results."
