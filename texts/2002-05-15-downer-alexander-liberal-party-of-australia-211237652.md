 East Timor: Birth of a Nation  Introduction …

 At midnight this Sunday East Timor will achieve formal independence.

 For many, independence represents the end of a long road since the autonomy ballot in August 1999.  For the people of East Timor, the road has been much longer, stretching back to 1975 and before.  For all of us who have joined, at some point, East Timor’s road to independence, it will be a great day of celebration for the newest nation of the 21st century.

 For all of us it will be the beginning of a new journey.

 Australians, from all walks of life, admire the people of East Timor deeply.  The strength of that admiration will be clear on Sunday, when our Prime Minister leads so many Australians in Dili to the formal independence ceremony - from federal, state and local governments, from academia, from church, service, civil rights and aid organisations, and from business.

 East Timor’s celebration is truly a celebration shared by Australians, and I am pleased that many people here in Australia are organising their own celebrations for Sunday evening.  For us it is the climax of our involvement in helping East Timor along the path to independence.

 We are witnessing the birth of a nation.

 Australia and the international effort in East Timor …

 Australia has worked hard, together with the United Nations and other international friends of East Timor, in helping the East Timorese reach 20 May.  We should be encouraged by the many and significant achievements over the transition period, to which we have contributed.

 It is worth recalling that the opportunity for change in East Timor came in 1998 with the end of the Soeharto era.  A more open-minded president in Jakarta and our own survey of the East Timorese Diaspora in Australia, provided a better appreciation of how East Timorese leaders saw their future, and helped form the basis of our policy change.  This was marked by the Prime Minister’s letter to President Habibie in December 1998 which outlined a possible new approach to the East Timor. 

 The Howard - Habibie Summit in April 1999 in Bali helped pave the way for creating the conditions for a popular consultation.  Australia’s significant diplomatic and political effort helped firm up international support for an act of self-determination and later to restore security.

 Australia was involved from the outset.  We participated in the first UN monitoring mission, UNAMET, which culminated in a public verdict in favour of independence.  We led the INTERFET mission which restored security in East Timor in the dark days of 1999.  And we have contributed a great deal to the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).

 Our effort has been enormous, and sustained.  In short, we have played no small part in providing East Timor with building blocks for its future. 

 Australians have watched East Timor’s transition keenly - from the devastation of the post-ballot violence and destruction of late-1999, to a new country with a functioning

 executive and legislature, a developing judiciary, and the foundations for a strong public sector and civil society.

 Australians responded overwhelmingly to the 1999 crisis with many communities around the country quickly mobilising to help.  Our national effort has involved thousands of Australians living and working in East Timor, and many more contributing in kind, from their homes, churches, schools and places of work.

 The concern of ordinary Australians for the plight of East Timorese has been reflected in the commitment of the Government to assisting East Timor.

 We recognised very early on the significant international support that would be required to assist East Timor to independence, and to help repair the truly devastating post-ballot violence and destruction.  Our initial humanitarian effort, in 1999 and 2000, totalled around A$81 million.  And then we moved quickly to pledge A$150 million over four years in bilateral aid, to ensure certainty for East Timor in the transition period and early independence years.

 Our humanitarian and aid assistance, of course, has come on top of our significant defence support for East Timor: between July 1999 and June 2001 Australia’s contribution to the peace keeping effort was valued at some A$1.4 billion.  Over 15,000 Australian defence personnel have served as members of the international peacekeeping force.

 Australia’s response to the situation in East Timor has not been in isolation.  The international response - to which we contributed and helped build - was a remarkable example of international resolve to address a humanitarian and security crisis.

 That resolve has continued through the joint donor trust funds, supporting the East Timorese administration and projects to rehabilitate and develop a fledgling state.  Biannual donor conferences have enabled multilateral and bilateral donors to consult regularly with the East Timorese leadership.  We were pleased to host the fourth Donors Conference here in Canberra.

 We have to be realistic about the level of assistance the international community is able to sustain in East Timor.  But the Government remains concerned that the progress we have made is not compromised by lack of resources or commitment.  It is critical that the donor community continues to engage East Timor through the crucial first years of independence. 

 East Timor’s future …

 For our part, Australia will continue to work closely with East Timor, the United Nations and other donors to ensure the people of East Timor can build for themselves a peaceful and prosperous future.

 …a democratic base … 

 Building a stable and sustainable democracy is critical to that future.  It is a task Australia has supported strongly.  Since January 2001 the Australian Electoral Commission has been helping develop skills and resources for managing electoral processes.  We saw these displayed in the recent Presidential election.  The Australian observer delegation witnessed a peaceful and well managed election.  The continued high voter turn-out - more than 86 per cent - was a greatly encouraging sign for East Timor’s democratic future. 

 … self-administration …

 Australia’s assistance to East Timor’s transition has focussed on building local capacities.  We have trained over a thousand East Timorese civil servants - including from central and district administrations.  We have helped develop effective budget management and tax systems, and other basic functions of government.  And we have provided scholarships targeted at developing and improving skills.

 Our efforts have helped East Timor’s government to grow and develop over the transition period - and the reins are now very much in East Timor’s hands.  The vast majority of civil servants now are East Timorese.  It is a process that now has its own momentum, preparing the East Timorese for government at independence, and beyond.

 … civil society and development…

 A strong and effective democracy cannot develop without a strong civil society.  Australian aid is helping strengthen civil society by partnering Australian and East Timorese organisations working on reconciliation and peace building, good governance, human rights and support for the more vulnerable people in society. 

 Likewise, a strong democracy cannot be built in East Timor without attending to the needs of all East Timorese.  The vast majority of the population live in rural areas.  So Australia has worked to ensure that our assistance reaches beyond Dili.  We have begun projects in water supply, sanitation, community development and health in a number of districts.  And we support micro-finance programs, offering small loans to poor people in rural communities to start small businesses and generate much needed income. 

 … the economy …

 We applaud the first - and responsible - budget for an independent East Timor, and we hope that such realism continues.  Budget projections for East Timor suggest that it will be critically important to broaden and deepen the economic base, and to develop an environment for the private sector that promotes growth and investment.

 Setting in place a legal and regulatory framework for developing the private sector - including resolving land tenure issues - will be crucial to ensuring economic growth, private investment and new jobs.  Over the past two years, our support has helped build the capacity of the East Timorese administration to manage all aspects of government and private property.  The skills and knowledge we are helping to build should help the East Timorese develop and implement legislation to manage their land ownership issues in the future.

 Australia and East Timor have reaffirmed their commitment to the joint development of Timor Sea petroleum resources, recognising in particular the crucial importance of these resources in promoting East Timor’s economic development.  To this end, Australia and East Timor have been working on converting the Timor Sea Arrangement into a new treaty.  The Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources and I met Chief Minister Alkatiri on 10 May and had very productive discussions.  Having agreed on the “architecture”, I hope the two governments will be able to sign the new Timor Sea Treaty in Dili on East Timor’s independence on 20 May.   Australia and East Timor are committed to expeditious development of the key Bayu-Undan and Greater Sunrise petroleum fields.

 …human rights, reconciliation and the rule of law …

 A crucial part of any functioning democracy is the safeguarding of human rights.  The Australian government has been concerned to see the perpetrators of human rights abuse in East Timor brought to justice.  We have welcomed Indonesia’s ad hoc human rights tribunal on East Timor.  And we are looking to see the trials proceed with independence and integrity.

 Likewise, Australia has welcomed the establishment of the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor.  One of the key objectives of the Commission is to provide a legal mechanism for reconciliation and re-integration at the community level.  The work of the Commission is still in very early stages but progress is encouraging - and we are pleased to have supported its work, and the work of the serious crimes unit in East Timor.

 The role of East Timorese leaders in national reconciliation is vital.  The President-elect, Xanana Gusmao, has been particularly active meeting former militia leaders, and encouraging refugees to return to East Timor.

 Settling the refugee situation in west Timor will be crucial to East Timor’s future stability as a nation.  Australia has been helping refugees to return either voluntarily to East Timor, or to resettle elsewhere in Indonesia, in a program worth $13 million since 1999.

 We are particularly pleased to hear of the high levels of refugee repatriation following the Presidential election.

 … relations with neighbours …

 The East Timorese will not live in isolation after independence.  The international community and the regional community are keen to embrace East Timor.  And a key to East Timor’s future will be the relationships that it forges abroad.  Most important, of

 course, will be East Timor’s relations with its neighbours.

 I am gratified at recent positive steps in relations between East Timor and Indonesia. The meeting I attended with my East Timorese and Indonesian counterparts in February this year was an important step to normalising East Timor’s relationships in the region and will be the start of further cooperation between our three countries. 

 I make particular note of the constructive approach to the relationship demonstrated by President Megawati and her Government and look forward to further initiatives where our three countries can work together in a regional partnership, such as at the inaugural South-West Pacific Dialogue to be held later this year.

 As a close friend and neighbour, Australia hopes to continue and build on the strong ties that have characterised our relationship.  We will do what we can to help East Timor integrate into the international community.

 … UN support …

 The United Nations mandate for a newly independent East Timor - UNMISET (UN Mission of Support in East Timor) - does not shy away from the challenges in East Timor.  Instead, it provides for support over two years in three main areas: essential public administration, law and order, and external security.

 Australia will continue to play a lead role, including in the peace-keeping force and UN police presence, which will be drawn down over the next two years.  We are committed to helping develop a modest East Timor Defence Force and Police Service.  Our goal remains the gradual withdrawal of the UN mission - as East Timor develops its own capacities.

 Conclusion …

 It is appropriate for the Government formally to register its gratitude to the UN Secretary General, His Excellency Kofi Annan, for his decisive leadership on East Timor over the past years.  Mr Sergio Vieria de Mello, the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative and Transitional Administrator in East Timor, deserves our thanks as someone who has been instrumental in achieving so much in time for independence.

 While there have been many heroes among the Australian armed forces who have served in East Timor, I want to mention particularly Lieutenant General Peter Cosgrove who led the INTERFET mission and was an asset not only to Australia but also the international community.

 The Government commends Mr James Batley, our head of mission in Dili since June 1999, and a number of superb officers from across government, for their unfailing dedication in East Timor’s transition to democracy, and Australia’s part in it.  I say thank you on behalf of all Australians for your work.

 The biggest congratulations, of course, goes to the people of East Timor and their leaders.  Australia wishes them well as they face the challenges and joys of nationhood.  We stand ready to help.  

 Last year Australia celebrated one hundred years of federation, and of peaceful democracy, as the first newly independent nation of the 20 th century.  At midnight on Sunday, East Timor will become the first newly independent nation of the 21 st century.  Together, as friends and neighbours, our descendants can look forward to celebrating 100 years of peace and democracy in East Timor at the beginning of the 22nd century.

 It is immensely gratifying for the Government to have helped secure the ballot on independence, to have worked through the difficult transition to independence, and to be able to celebrate with East Timor on 20 May.  It is to the great credit of the Prime Minister and his leadership that Australia can reflect proudly on its contribution to East Timor’s achievement of nationhood.

 And it is gratifying personally for me, as Foreign Minister, to have been a part of this process.  I know, too, that the coming of independence is also a matter of pride for the many ordinary Australians who have also given their support, in many and varied ways, to the East Timorese people.

 Most importantly, I can only begin to imagine how the prospect of Sunday’s transition feels for the people of East Timor, who have endured so much, to have achieved

 independence at last.

 As a Government, and as a people, our heartfelt support goes to East Timor on the occasion of its independence.  It is, truly, the birth of a nation
