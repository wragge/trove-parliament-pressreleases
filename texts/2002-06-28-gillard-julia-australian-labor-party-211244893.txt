 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 WOOMERA BREAKOUT CONDEMNED BY LABOR

 Labor  condemns  outright  the  disgraceful  and  criminal  behaviour  of  the  refugee support  group  that  assisted  a  number  of  asylum-seekers  escape  at  the  Woomera detention centre overnight.

 Actions such as this do nothing to assist the asylum seekers and instead could lead to them facing criminal charges.

 This incident is not the first such problem in Australian detention centres to date and clearly there is a need to address security and other problems in these centres.  Labor reinforces the call for the mothballing of the Woomera Detention Centre and for the management of the detention centres to be returned to Government control.

 Whatever view one takes of the policy of mandatory detention there is no excuse for this criminal behaviour and Labor condemns it outright.
