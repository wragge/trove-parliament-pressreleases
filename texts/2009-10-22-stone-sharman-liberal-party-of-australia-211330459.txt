 43rd boat: Another policy failure for Labor 

 

 Another people smuggler boat arrived this morning, the sixth this month. However the  Prime Minister continues to refuse to admit that he must take direct action to deal with this  deadly smuggler surge.   

 This is the 43rd boat to arrive since the Rudd Government began softening border protection  in August 2008 and the second in two days. Over 2000 people have now been guided to  Christmas Island.   

 The most recent boat, carrying 32 passengers, was intercepted 7 nautical miles west of  Christmas Island.   

 Mr Rudd is desperate to shift the task of locking up detainees to the Indonesians.  Unfortunately, as long as Mr Rudd continues to unravel our strong border protection  measures, the pull factors will see the surge continue. Too much money is to be made out of  the business of selling passage on leaky wooden boats.   

 Mr Rudd cannot continue to just sit on his hands and expect the Indonesians to do  Australia’s heavy lifting.    

 He has failed to take the advice of the Federal Police and the Indonesian officials who have  warned him of the consequences of softening Australia’s policies.   

 Mr Rudd must do more than pretend outrage and concern. He must take action.
