 Leader of the Opposition

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH  DR JOHN HEWSON, MP - LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  BRIDGEWATER, SOUTH AUSTRALIA - 8 DECEMBER 1991

 E & OE - PROOF COPY ONLY TRANSCR\0042M

 Subjects: ALP leadership struggle; reform package and the wine  industry;

 Jrnlst:

 Dr Hewson, the recent turmoil in the Labor Party, the dumping of  John Kerin, is it the end of Bob Hawke?

 Hewson:

 Well, the real test for Bob Hawke now is whether he's prepared  to recall Parliament. He'd have to face a Caucus meeting and I  challenge him to actually recall the Parliament, as he's 

 foreshadowed, between now and Christmas, and then to settle the  leadership issue once and for all. He's got a unique opportunity  to do it, the Government is totally paralysed. It's about time  they settled his standing in the Party, they settled the 

 leadership issue and he got on and governed the country, or  whoever wins should get on and govern the country.

 Jrnlst:

 ...(inaudible)...

 Hewson:

 Well, that seems to be the imagery that is being created by some  people in the ALP, certainly the New South Wales Right yesterday  created the impression that Bob Hawke is on his last days. It  is time for Bob Hawke to show some leadership. I challenge him  to recall the Parliament, hold his Caucus meeting and settle the 

 leadership issue once and for all.

 Jrnlst:

 Well, how long do you think this situation can continue before  the Labor Party is totally destabilised.

 Well, they are totally destabilised and that's why I think there  is a sense of urgency for settling it now. He ought to settle  it, he can settle it, Parliament is due to resume before 

 Christmas, so let's call it back later this week, have his Caucus  meeting, have the leadership vote and settle the issue.

 Jrnlst:

 Do you think he will do it?

 Hewson:

 He should, as I say, there is some legislation coming back from  the Senate, there is an opportunity there, it has been 

 foreshadowed that Parliament would sit either this week or next  week - we are yet to be told when it is. I think he should call 

 Parliament back, as I say, hold the Caucus meeting, have a vote  and settle the issue once and for all. Whether it's Keating or  whether it's any one of a number of others in the Melbourne Cup  field, let's find out, let's get the matter settled, let's get 

 on and govern the country, because we're in the worst recession  in 60 years. Everybody out in the electorate is crying out for  some leadership. We've put down an alternative, we've put down  some policies that the government can follow and I'd like to see  them get on and implement some of those policies.

 Jrnlst:

 ... in your Coalition package. Senator Graham Richardson is  quoted in the Sunday Age today as saying that Labor would do even  better. What's your reaction?

 Hewson:

 Well, they've had nine years, almost, in government and really  what our package says is this is the sort of thing you should  have done over the last nine years. You could have had Australia  in a significantly better shape if you had have. I'm pleased in 

 that sense that even Senator Richardson is going to implement  some of those policies. We've already seen one of them picked  up, the Coal Export Levy has been abolished. That was one of our  proposals and there have been other hints already, not only  Richardson but other Ministers, that they are going to steal bits 

 and pieces. I think they ought to implement the lot, I think  they ought to embrace this excellent policy package and turn this  country around. We'll certainly support them.

 Jrnlst:

 The Small Business Association is going one better, saying that  Mr Hawke should basically flatout out resign. He can't govern  while he's looking over his shoulder. Do you think that 

 increased pressure from business may have some sort of effect.

 Hewson:

 I think what it does is put Mr Hawke under real pressure to 

 settle the issue once and for all. He can certainly settle it  and he should call on a vote and, if he's not worried about his  leadership the simple thing is to call on a vote and settle it.  And it's, the electorate is just fascinated at the choice that's 

 being presented. You can imagine a choice between Keating, the  architect of the whole demise and Bob Hawke, but it is important  that they settle it, and, you know, or open the field up to 

 others. We see Simon Crean and Kim Beazley and Brian Howe and  maybe even Ralph Willis see themselves all as potential 

 leadership leaders of the ALP so they ought to just hold the  Melbourne Cup leadership vote once and settle the issue so they  can get on and govern the country.

 Jrnlst:

 What are the odds of Hawke surviving?

 Hewson:

 Well, I can't really put odds on it. You listen to the New South  Wales Right, the answer is zero, he's got no chance of surviving.  But I think people just want it settled. The electorate is 

 intolerant of all this speculation and I'm sure they're totally  confused. There seems to be a push to bring back Mr Keating.  You know putting Keating in charge of a government would be like  putting Saddam Hussein in charge of Kuwait. It's just a 

 ridiculous concept that they would be so desperate as to go back  to the architect of the whole demise, but, people want it 

 settled, so let's get it settled and Bob Hawke can do that, he  can recall Parliament, he can hold the Caucus meeting, he can  pull on a vote, he can settle the issue and then hopefully the  issue will be settled once and for all.

 Jrnlst:

 So you'd rather face Paul Keating at the next election.

 Hewson:

 Well, if Keating gets up it will be a godsend to us, let me tell  you. You couldn't give Paul Keating away in a chook raffle.

 Jrnlst:

 Dr Hewson, on another matter, what have you been able to offer  the wine industry today.

 Well, we think our package is overwhelmingly favourable to the  wine industry, the abolition of payroll tax, the abolition of  petrol excise and most importantly the abolition of sales tax are  fundamentally beneficial to the wine industry. If you look at 

 the whole package, though, some of the changes in other costs,  the lowering of transport costs, the cleaning up of the 

 waterfront, lowering the costs of electricity generation and so  on, are all beneficial to this industry and, of course, most  importantly we've taken a decision not to impose an excise tax  on the wine industry as part of this package. So collectively 

 I think the industry is significantly better off, and it's one  of the true value-added industries in Australia. It's in fact,  the industry that probably adds more value than any other in  Australia and it's cracking international markets, exports and 

 booming, ...(inaudible)... the industry, the wine industry will  support, which is what our package does.

 Jrnlst:

 What's the industry's response to that?

 Hewson:

 Well, I think they're very pleased with the tone of the meeting  this morning. You'd be better to ask the industry than to ask  me but I thought they were very supportive. They've struggled  for years with excessive taxation, they've done the right thing, 

 they've gone out pretty much on their on own, and cracked very  difficult international wine markets against the world's top  producers, they've demonstrated we can make wine that is at least  as good a quality as the rest of the world, in some cases you 

 would say better.  And they're cracking markets in the UK, in the  US, in Sweden, in Japan, it's an export success story and in that  sense our package will be giving them an even better chance to  perform off-shore.

 Jrnlst:

 ... consumption tax on wine.

 Hewson:

 There will be a GST on wine, but with the abolition of sales tax  and petrol excise and payroll, the net effect is going to be  quite small. As far as the wine producers are concerned, and the  industry as a whole, their export bases are stronger, they're  more competitive as a result of the package and they should do 

 even better in the international market.  As I say, the have done  very well in recent years with phenomenal growth in exports  around the world.

 ....(inaudible)...

 Hewson:

 I don't know. I think the industry will probably do their own  sums on that. The whole package is designed to eliminate the  cost disadvantages under which the industry presently operates  and they are significant disadvantages that are being eliminated.

 Jrnlst:

 .  . .(inaudible)...

 Hewson:

 Look, I don't know. That's a decision that they'd have to m a k e .   With just the change from the sales tax to the goods and services  tax, I think, adds about five cents to a glass of wine, but if  you look at the whole package and the abolition of petrol excise 

 and payroll and the elimination of the other cost disadvantages,  I don't know. That's a decision that the industry will obviously  make and in due course, I imagine they will provide some 

 estimates for y o u .

 Thank y o u .
