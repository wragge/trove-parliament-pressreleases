 TRANSCRIPT  THE HON JOE HOCKEY MP   

 SHADOW TREASURER   

 DOORSTOP 

 WEDNESDAY 7 SEPTEMBER 2011 

 

 

 E&OE………………………………………………………………………………… 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Today’s National Accounts indicate solid growth in the Australian economy and this is  welcome news, but there are no more excuses for Wayne Swan and the Gillard Government.  No more excuses about not delivering a surplus. No more excuses for a shortage of job  growth. No more excuses on flat-lining productivity. There just can be no more excuses from  this government. 

 The Australian economy is showing solid growth as a rebound to the previous quarter. The  Coalition welcomes this news. There was solid growth in a number of fairly unexpected  areas, including manufacturing and consumer consumption, but the fact of the matter remains  that consumer confidence is flat-lining, business confidence is flat-lining and the fact of the  matter is it needs leadership from Canberra. 

 The Australian Government continues to disappoint the Australian people and there can be no  more excuses from the Gillard Government. No more excuses about not delivering a surplus,  starting to pay down government debt, no more excuses about their own incompetence.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 So in light of these numbers where should the government cut spending now? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 The government can start to cut spending by reducing its outlays on the NBN. We’ve said  time and time again, that nearly $40 billion on the NBN is wasteful. It is reckless and it is a  massive overpay for what will be delivered with faster broadband. If you want to improve  productivity, one of the ways to do it is to have a cost benefit analysis when you spend  money on infrastructure and the government so far has refused to have a cost benefit analysis 

 on the biggest piece of infrastructure that has been built in Australia, the National Broadband  Network. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 This 1.2% growth figure was more than what economists had been expecting. Do you think it  is a sign that the economy has recovered now from the effects of the summer floods? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 I think that is clear. I think the great bulk of the impact of the summer floods has passed  through the Australian economy and now people do want to see the economy recover  strongly. The challenge at the moment is that the government is introducing punitive  measures such as the carbon tax, the mining tax and their own incompetence on a range of  things, which is having an impact. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 Economists say there has been an unexpected rise in household spending, so consumer  confidence could be coming back again? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Well I’m glad that consumer confidence is coming back but we’ll wait and see from the  separate data on confidence issues. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 Mr Hockey there have been some reports today that Cory Bernardi offered to help Geert  Wilders, a Dutch politician, if he were to visit Australia next year or later this year. Do you  think that Cory Bernardi should be disciplined for offering to give help to a Dutch politician  who’s on the far right of politics? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Neither Cory Bernardi the Coalition will be facilitating this visit. This gentleman seems like a  very unpleasant character and I think it’s far better that we have nothing to do with him. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 What’s the real story with Cory Bernardi and Geert Wilders … 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 You’d need to ask Cory Bernardi, I’m not familiar with the details. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 If it turns out that Cory Bernardi had offered help to an anti-islamic politician should he be  stripped of his Parliamentary Secretary responsibilities. 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 I’m not going to speculate on those matters. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 [inaudible] 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Well I’m sure Tony Abbott is telling the truth. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 With the Malaysian situation, it seems that the Coalition is saying that they’re going to back  away from supporting the Malaysian thing. 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 We have never supported the Malaysia people swap and we will not support an initiative such  as that that sends unaccompanied boys and girls to a third party country where we do not  have supervision of their welfare. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 Are you backing away from your pledge to help the government with this situation. 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 No we’ve offered to facilitate Nauru. If there is any discrepancy at all then the Nauru solution   with temporary protection visas and a capacity to turn back the boats if the sort of formula  that has worked in the past and we believe will work again in the future. 

 We offer in good faith to help the government in this matter but they’re playing games. I  can’t believe Julia Gillard met with the leadership of Nauru and didn’t even raise this issue.  This has been the hottest political issue in Australia in the last few days, she hasn’t ruled out  that option, yet she doesn’t have that discussion [inaudible]. It’s bizarre leadership. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 Are you concerned that if the Coalition were in power that refugee advocates could actually  challenge the Nauru solution of an Abbott Government. 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 No, they’ve had opportunities to challenge it in the past and they didn’t. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 

 Well they could this time because they’ve got more funding. 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Well they could, but I would suggest they won’t, because we believe that our proposal which   has worked in the past, has not been challenged in the past, would be able to withstand  challenges into the future.
