 Border Protection Command Boards Vessel 

 22 October 2011 

 ACV Hervey Bay, operating under the control of Border Protection Command, boarded a  suspected irregular entry vessel west of Ashmore Islands today. 

 Initial indications suggest that there are 15 passengers and one crew member on board.  

 Border Protection Command will now make arrangements for the passengers to be  transferred to Christmas Island, where they will undergo initial checks and their reasons for  travel will be established.
