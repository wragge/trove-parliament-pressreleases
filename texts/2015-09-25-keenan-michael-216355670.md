 Four young Australians attend Global Youth Summit Against Violent Extremism in NYC 

 Four talented young Australians will travel to New York City this weekend to take part in the ONE95:  Global Youth Summit Against Violent Extremism. 

 This Summit, held on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly will bring together more than  300 youth from all over the world. 

 They will develop and showcase their innovation to prevent the rise of violent extremism in their  communities with the aim of linking projects with private sector financial and training support. 

 I am pleased to announce the four young Australian representatives are: 

 ï· Widyan Fares from New South Wales;   ï· Oussama Abou-Zeid from Victoria;   ï· Jeeven Nadanakumar from the Australian Capital Territory; and   ï· Sowaibah Hanifie from South Australia.  

 All four of these young Australians are proud representatives of our country and their local communities  and have already achieved great things in their early careers. 

 While at the Summit, participants will provide insights and input into the Action Agenda aimed at giving  advice to youth-focused organisations on steps to prevent violent extremism and build community  resilience.  

 The Action Agenda will be presented at next week’s Leader’s summit to Counter ISIL and CVE and will  be used to guide future youth initiatives against violent extremism. 

 Violent extremism is an issue all communities are facing.  It is a long-term challenge and one that  requires innovative and collaborative approaches between individuals, communities, industry and  governments.  

 The Australian Government is proud to support these young people’s involvement in the Global Youth  Summit as part of its commitment to countering violent extremism. 

 Initiatives such as the Global Youth Summit are a fantastic way of bringing together the skills,  knowledge and young people to tackle this global problem and I look forward to meeting our  representatives when in New York.
