 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 05/051 TUESDAY 8 FEBRUARY 2005    SENATOR LYN ALLISON AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS LEADER   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS SPOKESPERSON ON IMMIGRATION  CLOSED DOOR INQUIRY WON'T OPEN DETENTION CENTRE DOORS A judicial inquiry into the Cornelia case would have had greater powers to call witnesses and seek evidence, and would have been more openly conducted, the Australian Democrats said in response to the Government's announcement of a closed door inquiry into the detention of a mentally ill woman. Democrat's Leader Senator Lyn Allison said that by holding the inquiry into the Cornelia Rau case behind closed doors, it was inevitable there would be accusations of a Government cover up. "Secrecy about the evidence seems unnecessary. Those aspects of the case that would impinge on Cornelia Rau's privacy could be closed, while still being an open inquiry about the practices of the various agencies," Senator Allison said. "The Democrats hope that the inquiry, headed by an ex-police commissioner, leads to substantial improvements to the way missing person's cases are handled. But it clearly will do little or nothing to lead to better services for the mentally ill and the closure of Australia's detention centres," she said. "There is still a need for an inquiry into the state of Australia's mental health services, and we will move ahead with that this week. It will not be held behind closed doors," Senator Allison said. "An inquiry behind closed doors won't open the doors to the appalling conditions inside Australia's detention centres," Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Democrats' immigration spokesperson said. Senator Allison asked the Government in the Senate today, "How many people have become mentally ill since your Government put them into detention centres?" and "How many who are found to be refugees are released into the community without access to Medicare or other services, are suffering from mental illnesses caused by their detention?" Senator Bartlett asked the Immigration Minister Senator Vanstone to guarantee that asylum seekers in Baxter who blew the whistle on the condition of Cornelia Rau, would be able to give evidence to the inquiry and would not face any retribution for doing so. Senator Vanstone said she would get back to him.  Media contact Daele Healy 0419 867 649
