 Greens announce bill to restore Australia’s  refugee intake to 20,000   

 The Australian Greens have announced that they will introduce a bill into the Senate that would  reverse the Abbott government’s cuts and restore Australia’s humanitarian intake to 20,000 people  per annum.   

 “Slashing the refugee program by more than 6,000 places a year was a short-sighted move from the  Abbott government,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The Greens want to see the number of refugees that Australia is willing to take restored to 20,000 a  year.   

 “The current crisis in Iraq has shown why it’s so important for Australia to play its role in the  international effort to protect refugees. Tony Abbott needs to back up his words with action when it  comes to protecting those who are fleeing Iraq.   

 “Slamming the door in the face of more than 6,000 refugees a year is no way for Australia to be  acting in this time of unprecedented need.   

 “Rather than punishing refugees and trying to deny protection to as many as possible, Australia  should be working with our international allies to find a way to protect them.”
