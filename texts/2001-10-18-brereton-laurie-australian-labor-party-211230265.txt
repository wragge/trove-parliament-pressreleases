 FIJI SANCTIONS DECISION EXPLAINED

 “The  reason  behind  the  Howard  Government’s  premature  decision  to  lift  sanctions  is  now clear”, the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laurie Brereton, said today.

 “The Government’s 5 October decision to lift sanctions, announced just a few hours before the  calling  of  Australia’s  election,  was  clearly  designed  to  facilitate  negotiations  for  Fiji  to become another Pacific camp for Afghan and Iraqi asylum seekers.”

 “It remains to be seen whether the Government of Fiji will agree to this proposal.  However, by  lifting  sanctions  the  Howard  Government  acted  prematurely  and  inappropriately, breaking ranks with New Zealand and the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group.”

 The  Commonwealth  Ministerial  Action  Group  decided  in  August  to  allow  Fiji  to  return  to Commonwealth  forums  subject  to  free  and  fair  elections  and  a  new  government  being formed in accordance with the constitution.

 Indigenous  Fijians  backed  Prime  Minister  Lasenia  Qarase  in  Fiji’s  September  election. However, the new government does not include any representation from the Fijian Labour Party despite Fiji’s 1997 constitution requiring the dominant party to offer major opposition parties seats in the cabinet.

 Commonwealth  Secretary-General  Don  McKinnon  has  said  that  while  electoral  observers had concluded the poll was ‘an accurate reflection of the wishes of the people’, he was ‘not fully  satisfied  that  the  second  precondition  set  by  CMAG  for  Fiji’s  return  to  full Commonwealth membership has been met’.

 New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff has stated that ‘until such time as the outstanding constitutional issue can be dealt with in Fiji politically or through the courts, it is likely that any decision on readmission to the Council’s of the Commonwealth will await resolution of that issue.  Likewise a final decision on sanctions will depend on this matter being resolved.’

 On 5 October, former Fijian Prime Minister Chaudhry expressed his deep disappointment at the Howard Government’s decision to lift sanctions, saying that it ‘sets a poor example for regional security and suggests that Australia doesn’t stick to its word’.

 “We now know why the Howard Government broke its word”, Mr Brereton said.  “They are pursuing  another  temporary  fix  to  the  problem  of  illegal  boat  arrivals.   This  is  another expedient chapter in their stewardship of Australia’s foreign policy.”

 “As I indicated on 5 October, a Beazley Labor Government will give strong support for an inclusive  political  settlement  consistent  with  Fiji’s  constitution  and  the  rule  of  law.   Only when  we  are  satisfied  that  proper  constitutional procedures  are  being  followed,  will  Labor fully normalise Australia’s bilateral relationship with Fiji.”
