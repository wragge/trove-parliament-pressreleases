 HUNTER ALP MP'S URGED TO SUPPORT MIGRATION BILLS

 Monday, September 24, 2001

 Senator Tierney today urged Federal Hunter MP’s from the Labor Party to support the Federal Government attempts to strengthen migration laws, with legislation going through parliament this week.

 “All of the Hunter region’s Labor MP’s rejected legislation three weeks ago that would have strengthened Australia’s ability to protect its borders and mean tougher penalties for people smugglers,” Senator Tierney said.

 “This was despite overwhelming public support for these measures and calls for illegal immigrants to use the existing migration system.

 “I suspect that after such high public support for these measures contained in the bills, Labor will come in and support the government on this issue this week.

 “But the question arises as to why they can support this legislation this week, when three weeks ago there was an absolute refusal to do so from the ALP.

 The Government’s approach on this matter involves minimising the flow of people seeking to illegally enter our country, working with other nations to prevent and disrupt people smuggling, identifying people in genuine need of refugee protection and assisting them, and the prompt removal of those who aren’t refugees.

 “These bills will ensure that Australia is meeting its obligations in relation to asylum seekers whilst also sending a clear and unambiguous message to people traffickers, that we will no longer tolerate deliberate flouting of our laws and of abuse our compassion,” Senator Tierney said.

 “It puts beyond doubt that decisions about who can and can’t enter Australia is the sovereign power of the Australian Parliament.”
