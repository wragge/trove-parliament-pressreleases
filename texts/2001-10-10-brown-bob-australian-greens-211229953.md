 Ruddock Unbelievable

 The Minister for Immigration’s assertion that young children were thrown overboard from the refugee boat in “premeditated” parental abandonment last weekend is unbelievable, Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.

 “That the children were jettisoned, if it happened, points to great alarm or terror as a result of the Howard Government’s new policy being implemented,” Senator Brown said.

 “There should be independent observers or journalists on the naval ships: otherwise the government exposes the navy as well as the asylum seekers to potentially damaging publicity when Mr Howard is at fault.

 “Videotape of last weekend’s incident must be released.

 “Mr Ruddock is not Minister for propaganda and is not enlisted to select what the public see,” Senator Brown said.
