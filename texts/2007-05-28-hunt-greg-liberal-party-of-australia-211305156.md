 THE HON GREG HUNT MP  PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY   TO THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS   

 SPEECH 

 28 May, 2007 

 Speech: Africa Day  Thank you Mr L’Estrange. 

 Your excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. 

 It is a great pleasure to be here today to celebrate Africa Day and to help launch Africa Week. 

 I want to congratulate the African Union and its predecessor, the Organisation for African Unity,  for what they have achieved in the last 44 years. The African Union’s goal of encouraging  development in Africa is as important today as ever. 

 Tonight I want to consider Australia’s relationship with Africa across three fronts: 

 â¢ the economic dimension, as an indispensable element to achieving human dignity   â¢ the human dimension   â¢ and the security dimension.  

 Economic 

 A growing relationship 

 Australia’s relations with the countries of Africa do not usually attract the same degree of attention  as our relations with some of our nearer neighbours and, from Africa’s point of view, Australia is  not as big a presence as, say, some European countries. But we do have strong shared interests with  Africa, and these have grown significantly over the past few years. 

 We have a substantial bilateral trading and people-to-people relationship with South Africa, and a  long-standing trade and political relationship with Egypt. And we have a history of involvement  with sub-Saharan African states through the Commonwealth.   

 We also have a growing relationship: 

 â¢ two-way trade has doubled in value in the past seven years and was worth $6 billion in 2006   â¢ Australian oil, gas and mining companies are investing in Africa   â¢ there are at least 80 Australian mining companies with significant interests in Africa 

 This trade and investment brings benefits to both of us - economic growth that delivers higher  standards of living. 

 Improvements in travel links have also made it easier for Australians to travel to a wider range of  African destinations (86,300 Australians visited Africa in 2005-06). And more students from Africa  are studying in Australia. We welcome the students and we hope that Australia’s cost-competitive  and high quality education will encourage more students to come. 

 Opening global markets 

 A strong and prosperous future for Africa also depends on breaking down the barriers to trade.  Australia is committed to opening up global markets, including through the Doha Round. 

 Freeing up world trade is the best way we can help alleviate poverty and strengthen economies in  many African countries. 

 Human 

 HIV 

 Australia, of course, recognises the development challenges that Africa continues to face. We are  keen to play a role in helping to build a better future for Africa 

 In the recent budget we increased aid to Africa by over $12 million to $94.4 million in 2007-08.  Our Africa program focuses on the countries of Southern and Eastern Africa. The program’s goal is  to help improve governance, improve the delivery of essential services, and assist in the fight  against HIV/AIDS. 

 Defeating the scourge of HIV/AIDS in African nations will be critical to their future development. 

 Humanitarian crises 

 We also stand ready to help when humanitarian crises strike - whether caused by conflict or natural  disaster. 

 In 2006-07, we expect to provide more than $28 million in humanitarian assistance. In April, the  Government announced funding of $1.5 million for mine action-related activities in Uganda and  Angola and a further $1 million for the protection of women and children displaced by conflict in  northern Uganda. 

 And in 2006, Australia was the fourth-largest bilateral donor to the World Food Programme's  Emergency Operation for people displaced by conflict in Darfur and southern Sudan. 

 Since 2004 Australia has given $58 million of aid to Sudan, the bulk of which has gone to Darfur. 

 But our assistance goes beyond provision of emergency aid. Our humanitarian and refugee  immigration program helps those seeking to escape from danger 

 Currently about half of Australia’s humanitarian visas are offered to Africans, particularly Sudan  (more than 15,000 since 2003 for Sudan). 

 Our immigration program reflects the UN High Commissioner for Refugees’ resettlement priorities. 

 Security 

 Peacekeeping 

 Regionally, we commend the African Union’s efforts to address conflicts on the continent. 

 The African Union has made an important contribution to the search for peace in Darfur, both by  providing its good offices to help the parties negotiate an end to the conflict and through the work  of its Mission in Sudan, even in the face of considerable challenges. 

 It is important that AU members continue to work at regional conflicts and trouble-shooting  including in Sudan and West Africa. 

 Australian troops have worked in peacekeeping operations across Africa: in Zimbabwe, Namibia,  Somalia, Rwanda, Western Sahara, and Ethiopia/Eritrea. Most recently, we have sent Australian  military and police personnel to Sudan to work with the UN Mission and support implementation of  the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in southern Sudan. 

 UN reform 

 On the international stage we recognise Africa’s desire to play more of a role. 

 Australia and Africa share views on UN reform 

 Australia supports appropriate representation for Africa in the Security Council 

 Australian Governments have long advocated expanding the permanent membership of the UN  Security Council to make it more compatible with geographic realities. 

 Zimbabwe 

  Before I finish, I would like to mention the current problems in Zimbabwe. Australia has a proud  record of supporting human rights and democratisation in southern Africa, including in South  Africa, where we supported the anti-apartheid struggle, and in Zimbabwe, where we played a role in 

 assisting that country’s independence. 

 We have also had strong people-to-people links with Zimbabwe. Australians and Zimbabweans of  all backgrounds have visited, studied, lived and worked in each country. These strong links explain  why Australians have been so disappointed at Zimbabwe’s descent into political and economic  disarray over the past few years. 

 The Australian people and Government remain committed to supporting change which will benefit  the people of Zimbabwe and we will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to alleviate the  impact of the Zimbabwean Government’s disastrous economic policies. 

 Conclusion 

 Australia-Africa relations are growing. And Africa is growing too. 

 I would like to congratulate you on the program of activities you have organised for Africa week. It  is a good chance to raise the profile of Africa and show the community the things that Africa has  achieved.   

 Thank you.
