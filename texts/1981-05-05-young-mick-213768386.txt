 PRESS RELEASE 

 I I

 FROM MICK YOUNG, MP,  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 The announcement by the "Frazor Gang" to transfer responsibility  for the operation of Migrant Hostels to private enterprise will  open the door to unscrupulous entrepreneurs to take advantage of  newly arrived immigrants and refugees.

 No one knows how much money will be saved by giving the responsibility  for Migrant Hostels to private enterprise.

 I have contacted five different Departments affected by cuts  in my own area and not even one of them could tell me how much  will be saved following the Report.  Many are hastily working on  "feasibility studies".

 If the desired ..effect of the Frazor Report was to shock the system,  and to distract attention from Peacock,  no doubt they have achieved  that.

 The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is one of the  most severely hit by the Razor Gang. It is estimated that nearly  $10 million will be cut from the Department's present expenditure.

 This at a time when the number of immigrants allowed into Australia  is reaching an all time high.
