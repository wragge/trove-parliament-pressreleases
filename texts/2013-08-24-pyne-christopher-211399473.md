 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR,  JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH THE HON. CHRISTOPHER PYNE MHR,    FEDERAL MEMBER FOR STURT,  CAMPBELLTOWN, SOUTH AUSTRALIA 

 

 Subjects: The Coalition's $7.5 million commitment to the Campbelltown Leisure Centre redevelopment; the  Coalition’s Real Solutions plan; Labor’s FBT hit on cars; Olympic Dam expansion; crisis in Syria; polls;  Kevin Rudd’s negative political ads; the Coalition's commitment to upgrade Adelaide's North South Road  Corridor; the Coalition's paid parental leave scheme.   

 E&OE........................................................................................................................................... 

 

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It’s great to be here in Campbelltown Leisure Centre in Christopher Pyne’s electorate of Sturt to be with  Christopher Pyne my friend and Shadow Ministerial colleague and Manager of Opposition Business and the  senior South Australian in the Federal Coalition parliamentary team. I want to thank the Mayor Simon  Brewer for making Christopher and myself so welcome. Obviously, this is an exciting day for the Council  which runs this leisure centre because I am here today to confirm that an incoming Coalition government  will commit $7.5 million dollars towards a $17.5 million upgrade of this leisure centre. It is a very important  bit of community infrastructure. It serves a large and growing community. Obviously, it's very well utilised  but it is more than 40 years old now and it needs a very substantial upgrade.    

 This announcement today is a small but significant part of the Coalition's positive plans for a stronger  Australia and a better future. This election, which now has just two weeks to go, pits the positive plans of  the Coalition against more of the same from Mr Rudd and an obviously divided and dysfunctional Labor  Party.    

 I want to make it absolutely crystal clear what will happen if the Coalition's elected on September 7. We'll  build a stronger economy so that everyone can get ahead. We'll scrap the carbon tax, which will save the  average household $550 a year. We'll get the Budget back under control by ending the waste. We'll stop the  boats, and we'll build the roads of the 21st century because I want to be known as an infrastructure prime  minister.    

 It's particularly important that there be a change of government in Canberra for the people of South  Australia, because the current Federal Government has damaged South Australia's economic prospects. The  carbon tax, the mining tax, the changes to the Australian Building and Construction Commission have made  it far harder for major resources investment to go ahead, made it far harder for BHP to go ahead with the  Olympic Dam mine expansion, which was something that so many South Australians had been pinning their  hopes on. If we want Olympic Dam to go ahead, if we want Olympic Dam to have a realistic prospect of 

 2 

 

 going ahead, we need a government in Canberra that will scrap the carbon tax, scrap the mining tax and  fully restore the Australian Building and Construction Commission.    

 Just recently, just recently, we have seen further evidence that the Rudd Government just doesn't get it when  it comes to South Australia with the fringe benefits tax hit on the car industry. I want to make it very clear to  every South Australian concerned about the future of the car industry. I want to make it very clear to every  South Australian worker in the car industry, we won't hit your jobs, we won't jeopardise your industry, we  won't go ahead with this $1.8 billion hit on company cars which the industry estimates could cut local car  production by 20 per cent.    

 So, it's a government which just doesn't get it, and every time Mr Rudd and the Labor Party unleash yet  another barrage of negative advertising, they demonstrate that they have no record to defend and no vision  for the future. As I said, I'm very pleased and proud to be with Christopher Pyne, my senior South  Australian colleague. He is a great, great fighter for South Australia, as well as being a warrior for good  causes, and I'm now going to invite him to speak to this announcement. 

 CHRISTOPHER PYNE:   

 Thank you very much, Tony.    

 It's terrific to be here to welcome the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, to my community, and he's  had a great welcome here at the Campbelltown Leisure Centre.    

 The $7.5 million that we are pledging today will make sure that the Campbelltown Leisure Centre  redevelopment happens and happens at a very high quality level. It will make an enormous difference to the  community in the east and north-eastern suburbs.    

 So, I'm very grateful that Tony Abbott and the economic team of the Coalition saw the good benefits of  supporting the Campbelltown Leisure Centre.    

 It's also important to have Tony Abbott here in South Australia, because this election campaign in our State  is all about jobs, about trying to get Olympic Dam back on the books again, trying to get that working again,  clearing away the environmental hurdles placed in the way and the union hurdles, the industrial hurdles put  there by the Australian Workers' Union over a period of time.    

 It's about confirming that we will scrap the fringe benefits tax increase, which will hurt the car industry in  this State and in Melbourne, costing us again more jobs and, in fact, this morning it was reported that not  only will the car workers at Holden be hit by falling car sales and the head of Hyundai only last week  confirmed that the orders for car leases had fallen by 37 per cent in the fortnight before last week, but also  we see in the paper that the Holden workers, many of them, have leased car vehicles that are Holdens  already and they will be hit by this FBT tax increase. So, they are getting it both ways - they are getting  falling car sales because of the FBT increase and themselves personally will be suffering as a result of the  changes to the fringe benefits tax.    

 Finally, we are seeing again in the paper that the Government's campaign is unravelling with more chaos  and dysfunction and division laid bare in the papers, in The Financial Review. This is not the kind of circus  that the Australian public deserve as a government in Canberra. They deserve an adult government that's  focused on jobs, on the cost of living, on protecting our borders and on good economic management. Yet  again this morning we see them back-biting, discussing their private Party matters in a way that is exactly  the opposite to what the Australian public expect from an adult government.    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Do we have any questions? 

 3 

 

 

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, the Prime Minister is going to return to Canberra to receive briefings on Syria. Have you been  offered briefings and do you think that this move by Mr Rudd is some sort of election campaign stunt or  tactic?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Joe, it's entirely appropriate for the Prime Minister to receive briefings on Syria. Obviously, terrible things  are happening in that country. It's very important that United Nations inspectors be allowed in to get to the  bottom of exactly what has happened. I hope the international community is able to do what it can to try to  ensure that the bloodshed ceases and ordinary human rights are once more respected. But it's entirely  appropriate that the Prime Minister be briefed on this. Julie Bishop, my Deputy and the Shadow Foreign  Minister will receive a briefing herself tomorrow from the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs  and Trade that will cover these issues and obviously I'm happy to receive briefings as well as the situation  unfolds.    

 QUESTION:   

 A Fairfax poll has you increasing your lead again in the election campaign. How will you guard against  hubris going into the last two weeks? Secondly, we have heard a lot in the last three years about the things  that you will undo, such as repealing the mining tax and the carbon tax. What positive vision, what new  things will we hear from you tomorrow night when you launch your campaign?    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, the thing that I'll be stressing when I launch my campaign tomorrow is that we have had the same  strong united team for three years. We have had the same clear plans for three years. I'll be building on those  strengths. The last thing you are going to see from me are sudden backflips, sudden changes of heart,  because that's not me. There is a continuity, a consistency, I like to think a coherence about the position of  the Coalition. It's been that way for three years, and I am confident that I can offer the same consistency and  clarity to the Australian people for the next three years should we win the election.    

 Now, as for the polls, look, frankly, I don't believe them. I think this is a very, very close race. It's a very,  very close race. Mr Rudd believes that his negative campaigning is working. The unions have a $12 million  war chest that they will spend mercilessly over the next fortnight. There will be nothing but wall to wall  negative advertising from the Labor Party. There will be nothing but relentless attacks on the Opposition  from the Labor Party. I say to the Australian people every time you hear Mr Rudd attacking the Opposition,  understand that he has no record to defend, he has nothing to say about our future and our country just can't  afford three more years like the last six. But he thinks it's working. He thinks it's working. He's got a spring  in his step because he thinks negative campaigning works. The point I keep making about the Labor Party is  that they are hopeless at government - absolutely hopeless at government, but they are brilliant at low  politics and we are going to see a lot of low politics from the Labor Party over the next fortnight.    

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Rudd has just gone back to Canberra for the briefing, is that just politics, is that a stunt?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 No. It's entirely appropriate when a serious international issue is unfolding for the Prime Minister to seek a  briefing. I certainly will be briefed by Julie Bishop on what she hears from the Secretary of the Department 

 4 

 

 of Foreign Affairs and Trade tomorrow and I would expect to be briefed myself at some point in the next  couple of days.    

 QUESTION:   

 A question, while you are here with Christopher Pyne, we have seen some further allegations made by Clive  Palmer regarding the Peter Slipper case. Are you confident that Mal Brough has nothing further to answer  on that case?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 They are very old allegations. It seems that they have been recycled for electioneering purposes. They have  been denied now, as they were denied in the past.   

 QUESTION:   

 Have you spoken to Mr Brough?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Not recently on this, no.    

 QUESTION:   

 Just back to the polls, Mr Abbott, as a big fan of John Howard, you must think it pretty poetic if Kevin Rudd  lost his seat at the election?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Again, I'm just not going to speculate on polls and I want to make it crystal clear that this campaign still has  a long, long way to run. If a week is a long time in politics, a fortnight is an eternity. The Labor Party think  that negative advertising, negative campaigning works. That is what we are going to see on a massive scale.  We will see the mother of all negative campaigns unleashed over the next fortnight. They are already  making completely fantastic claims about the Coalition, that we will sell schools we don't own, that we will  sack nurses we don't employ, that we will sell parks that belong to local councils. They will not let facts get  in the way of a good scare and we will see scare after scare after scare.    

 Now, I'm confident that, in the end, the Australian people will see through all of this, but Mr Rudd obviously  thinks that scare campaigns can fool enough of the people, enough of the time, for him to sneak back into  government in alliance with the Greens.   

 QUESTION:    

 Just wonder why you don't see any urgency in going back to Canberra to receive these briefings on Syria.  The latest reports are that cruise missiles have been stationed off Syria by the US. You could very well be  the Prime Minister in just a fortnight and be making some crucial decisions for our country. Why don't you  receive this urgent briefing like Kevin Rudd has and return to Canberra?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 As I said, Julie Bishop is going to receive a briefing tomorrow morning. I'm looking forward to receiving  briefings but I think it's quite possible for briefings to be had while I'm on the road. I don't for a second  underplay the seriousness of this situation, and I entirely support the Prime Minister receiving briefings. 

 5 

 

 That's a very good thing to happen, but certainly I will be continuing my campaign, but in between ordinary  campaigning events, I will be receiving briefings and updates on the situation in Syria.    

 QUESTION:    

 A question on Adelaide, on the North South Road Corridor is the Liberal Party fully committed to the  Darlington upgrade or are you considering the Torrens to Torrens upgrade?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 We are confident that the most important priority for the North South Corridor is the Darlington upgrade.  The South Australian motoring organisations have publicly said, repeatedly, that this is the most urgent  priority, that this is the biggest traffic bottle neck on that route right now. That's why we are determined to  make it happen. We are determined to get work underway within three years, because we want to make a  difference and I want to be an infrastructure prime minister. I don't want to be a Prime Minister like Mr  Rudd, who made a promise to alleviate this particular traffic black spot five years ago, and never delivered  upon it.    

 QUESTION:    

 By the end of this year, something like half of Syrians will be homeless and a quarter will be refugees,  including more than a million children. Would an Abbott government consider increasing the humanitarian  financial assistance to the situation and would it consider increasing the Syrian humanitarian refugee intake?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 The difficulty with any increase in the humanitarian component of our immigration intake right now is that  it's being filled by people smugglers. That's the problem. That's the problem. We are getting illegal arrivals  by boat at the rate of well over 3,000 a month right now, and that means that the entire component of our  humanitarian immigration, the entire component is being selected by people smugglers. Now, I accept that  there is a very serious situation in Syria. It is an escalating situation, it seems. Australia will do what it can to  help. We have always been a good international citizen. We will do our duty as far as we humanly can, but I  think it's too early to speculate on exactly what that might be.    

 QUESTION:    

 Voters do seem to be worried about your paid parental leave scheme in the Nielsen poll. Doesn’t that give  some weight to the concerns that have been raised about the policy among your own ranks?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I am very proud of this scheme. It demonstrates that the Coalition gets it when it comes to the modern  family, the modern workforce, and contemporary Australian woman. The average Australian family needs  more than one income to get by. That's why it is very important that we allow women a real choice to have a  family and a career. So, this is good for families, it's good for business, and it's good for the economy. I'm  totally committed to it, and the Labor Party, frankly, knows that it has been outplayed on this one. We have  seen Unions New South Wales come out and support the Coalition's scheme. Many Labor members of  Parliament know in their hearts, and will say privately, that our scheme is much better than theirs. Our  scheme is based on paying the parent who is at home for six months a full wage, a full wage. Labor's is  basically a welfare scheme. If you think that parental leave is a workplace entitlement, not a welfare  entitlement, you've got to back our scheme and the point I keep making is, you get paid at your full wage to  go on holidays, you get paid at your full wage to take long service leave. Why shouldn't be paid at your full  wage on parental leave?

 QUESTION:    

 Why don't you think it's sitting well with voters?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well again, we’ve seen scare after scare, lie after lie, from the Labor Party, and look, sometimes it takes  people a little while to sift the truth from the lies that have been heaped upon it by the Labor Party. But I am  confident that anyone who sits down and considers our policy will believe that this is a watershed change.  This is a very significant social advance and it will only happen if there's a change of Government on  September the 7th.   

 QUESTION:    

 Are you willing to change the scheme at all to get it through the Senate if the Greens want to negotiate?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 If we win the election, we will have a very clear mandate; to repeal the carbon tax, to repeal the mining tax  and to introduce a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme.    

 QUESTION:    

 We are in Julia Gillard's home town, a number of Liberal candidates and MPs here say that her knifing has  helped the Opposition in this State. Would you prefer to be facing Kevin Rudd or Julia Gillard?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I'm just not going to speculate on who may or may not have been the most formidable opponent. The fact is  any opponent who heads up the Labor Party is a formidable opponent. But the point I make is that the  Australian people are sick of a political party which has no stability at the top. Let's remember, in 2004, they  asked us to vote for Mark Latham. We know what happened to him. In 2007, they asked us to vote for Kevin  Rudd, and we know what happened to him. In 2010, they asked us to vote for Julia Gillard, and we know  what happened to her. Now, they are asking us to vote for Kevin Rudd again, but frankly I think the people  are awake to the fact that Labor doesn't keep its leaders and Labor cannot be trusted to offer a strong and  stable leadership team.    

 QUESTION:    

 Andrew Southcott said that he felt that Julia Gillard being knifed by - sorry, Julia Gillard being toppled by  Kevin Rudd, the home town girl, would work in his favour. Do you feel if you win your seat back in this  election you might have Kevin Rudd partly to thank for that success?   

 CHRISTOPHER PYNE:    

 There is no doubt in the 2010 election there was a Julia Gillard factor in South Australia and in Victoria.  That's why the margins in many of the Labor seats are seen quite high - double digit figures when they had  traditionally been in the low percentages. The axing of Julia Gillard, which highlighted the chaos and  division and dysfunction in the Labor Party for the last six years, has meant that that factor will be removed,  and I some think South Australia could well throw up some surprises on election day. But there is still two  weeks to go and Andrew Southcott and I and our candidates in Tom Zorich in Wakefield and Sue Lawrie in  Makin, Carmen Garcia in Adelaide and Matt Williams in Hindmarsh are all working their guts out to get the  message out. Damien Mills in Kingston and Nigel McKenna in Port Adelaide are all working very hard to  ensure that our message of stability…

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 …Cathie Webb in the Senate   

 CHRISTOPHER PYNE:    

 Cathie Webb, the number three…   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 … Gary Burgess in the Senate   

 CHRISTOPHER PYNE:    

 Thank goodness he’s here to help me! Cathie Webb and Gary Burgess at three and four on the Senate ticket.  If we win the fourth spot we'll be doing very well and I’ll certainly thank Kevin Rudd for that if we do get  down to number four on the Senate ticket. But they are all working very hard to get the message out to the  South Australian public about cost of living, jobs, border protection and economic management.    

 QUESTION:    

 Just back on the Greens, with them in the balance of power in the Senate, how would you approach that if  you win the election?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It's one of the tragedies of the modern Labor Party that they have sold their soul to the Greens. This is one of  the reasons why so many traditional Labor voters find it very hard to vote for the current dysfunctional and  divided Labor Party. The Labor Party is tearing itself to pieces over this de facto Coalition with the Greens. I  think that the Greens are political fringe dwellers. I think their economic policy, I think their general policies  are way to the left of either the Coalition or the ordinary Labor Party, and that's why I think if the Labor  Party knew its own long-term best interests it would do exactly what we have done and put the Greens  behind the major political alternative.   

 QUESTION:    

 If you feel that way, will you not negotiate with them in the Senate?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I am campaigning to win an election, and I have very clear policies, and if the Coalition wins the election on  September the 7th, I would expect our mandate to be respected by the Parliament.    

 QUESTION:    

 If they are economic fringe dwellers, Mr Abbott, how come they support your PPL and large elements of  your own party and also the National Party don't support it?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, even people who are wrong on most things are right on some things. When it comes to this, they had a  rare lucid moment.

 QUESTION:    

 You've criticised Labor for a negative campaign, you are still ahead of the polls. Are you expecting the  Prime Minister to try and have a pit stop on this election campaign and try and re-set his campaign? Are you  preparing for that? Is that something you are expecting?    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I'm running the best campaign that I possibly can. My campaign is determined by my strong team and by  our clear policies. I'll let the Labor Party do what it thinks is in its own best political interests, but what I'm  focused on is running a strong campaign which is saying to the Australian people we will do what we  reasonably can to reduce your cost of living pressures by scrapping the carbon tax, by scrapping the mining  tax, by cutting red tape by $1 billion a year, that will improve your job security. By not going ahead with the  fringe benefits tax slug on company cars, that too will improve your job security. I am on about practical  change, real change, for the benefit of Australian families and Australian workers and regardless of what Mr  Rudd does, that's what I will be doing for the next fortnight of the campaign.    

 Thank you.
