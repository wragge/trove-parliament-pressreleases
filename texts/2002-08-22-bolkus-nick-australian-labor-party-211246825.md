 SENATOR NICK BOLKUS DEPUTY CHAIR OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS SUB-COMMITTEE

 22 August 2002

 ASIO exposes Howard’s boat people dishonesty

 ASIO today exposed the Howard Government’s pre-election big lie on boat people by revealing that not a single one of the nearly 6000 boat people it assessed had been rejected on security grounds.

 The revelation came in evidence provided by the Director General of ASIO, Dennis Richardson, to the Human Rights Sub-Committee of Parliament’s Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee.

 Deputy Chair of the Human Rights Sub-Committee, Senator Nick Bolkus said Mr Richardson had revealed that 5986 boat people had been assessed by ASIO - 3658 in 2000/2001; 2281 in 2001/2002 and 47 between 1/7/2002 and 16/8/2002.

 Mr Richardson told the Committee that not one of these 6000 boat people interviewed by ASIO has been rejected on security grounds.

 This is in stark contrast to the Prime Minister’s desperate bid to link boat people with terrorists, when he told the Courier-Mail just three days before polling day:

 “you don't know who's coming and you don't know whether they do have terrorist links or not.”

 “Today’s evidence finally gives the Australian public the truth,” Senator Bolkus said after today’s hearing.

 “In doing so it exposes the lies peddled by senior members of the Howard Government before the election when voters were told that terrorists could be among the boat people.

 “The Howard Government set out to scare voters and win re-election on a campaign of fear.

 “Today’s evidence exposes the Howard Government’s pre-election campaign to link boat people with terrorists for the big lie it always was.”
