 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 05/014 MONDAY, 24 JANUARY 2005   SENATOR ANDREW MURRAY JASON MEOTTI AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS ELECTORAL MATTERS SPOKESPERSON CANDIDATE FOR SOUTH METRO REGION  ALMOST HALF WA’S 18 YEAR OLDS NOT ENROLLED TO VOTE       First Time Voters could play key role in State Election outcome - and they have only a week to enrol! The Australian Democrats today urged young people in Western Australia to enrol to vote before the Electoral rolls close - at 6pm, on Monday, 31st January 2005.   Australian Democrats Candidate for the South Metropolitan Region, Jason Meotti, says it is not just young people, but also new Australian citizens, including former refugees and migrants, who need to enrol to vote.  "Every vote is important and votes are never wasted if cast correctly,” Mr Meotti said. “Marginal seats in particular are often decided by only a handful of votes. "This state election is likely to be close with some very slim margins expected in some seats.  Every vote counts and your vote could make the difference,”  Mr Meotti said. Democrats spokesperson for Electoral Matters, Senator Andrew Murray, says that once the election is announced there is usually a week to enrol to vote before the rolls close.   “Voters only have to fill in one enrolment form to be enrolled for Federal, State and Local Government elections in Western Australia.  Although 17 year olds can enrol, they cannot vote until they are 18,” Senator Murray said.  A recently released study of year 12 students’ attitudes to voting found of those aged 17 and over, only a third of females and even less males had enrolled to vote.  Furthermore,  around half of all students -more girls than boys -  felt they lacked the knowledge to understand the issues, the political parties, or to make a decision about voting. (Youth Disengagement from the Political Process: 2004) “The best way to get politicians to take an interest in young people's issues is to make them accountable at the ballot box,” Senator Murray said.
