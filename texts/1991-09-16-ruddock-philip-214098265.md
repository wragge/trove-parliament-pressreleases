 ADDRESS BY PHILIP RUDDOCK MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 ON THE OCCASION OF THE LAUNCH OF CEDA'S PUBLICATION:

 "THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF IMMIGRATION"

 16 September 1991

 I would like to thank the members of the Committee for extending me the  honour of launching CEDA's important publication today.

 It brings together some of the most influential arguments put forward in the  public arena on the costs and benefits of immigration for the Australia of  today.

 Clearly some of the contributors to this publication have joined issue on  these questions. I also recognise in some of the papers, arguments that I  myself have put on the public record.

 Late last year the Opposition settled several policy issues in regard to  immigration which were outlined in my speech to the Bureau of Immigration  Research National Outlook Conference. Briefly, these developments in  policy were:

 Population: We determined that there were no relevant  arguments which require that we set an optimum population  target for Australia. We said only that any target was sufficiently  high such that present levels of immigration and foreseeable  levels of immigration would not need to be constrained by 

 consideration of optimum population issues.

 Short term Immigration: While our economy is performing badly

 and with proper administration of the migration program I  argued that the program would come in below projections.

 - Long term Immigration: Over the medium to long term we are  confident that a larger immigration intake could be sustained on  economic, environmental and demographic grounds.

 Further I was pleased that Professor Withers confirmed my view that for the  most desirable migrants, North America and New Zealand were now  competing with us by seeking larger numbers of more highly skilled better 

 educated more employable.

 Dr Birrell in his article suggested that immigration program was still  predicted on a net 125,000 migrants each year. In fact experience in the last  six months confirms my view that the program would be significantly lower.  My calculations show that based on a projected outcome of 111,000 less an  expected emigration of around 36,000 this years net outcome will come in  somewhere between 75,00 and 80,000. And I expect the program will reduce  further.

 No one here would dispute the invaluable contribution immigration has  made to the economic, cultural and political development of this country.  The identity of this nation is drawn from many different backgrounds. This  diversity is now part of our national culture and our national character of  which we can all be justly proud.

 Despite this there remains a misperception in the community about the  value this diversity brings. This was evidenced by recent contributions made  to Dr Hewsons Australia 2000 publication, "Australians Speak"  and earlier by the Fitzgerald committee report findings. Both quite clearly 

 evince the failure of the government to defend the National Agenda for a  Multicultural Australia and to make Australians aware, particularly, of the  definition which enshrines important overarching values and the commitment  to Australia first and foremost.

 As Dr Borowski and Dr Shu's excellent demographic profile of the  Australian population shows, Australia's population is largely composed of  overseas born people. Net migration has accounted for more than 40% of  the increase in Australia's population during the post-war period, drawing 

 people from a vast range of backgrounds.

 As I said, no one would dispute the contribution immigration has made to  Australia. But the debate now, as always, when the continuing value of  immigration is in dispute, focuses on whether or not it is sustainable at a  time of deep and enduring recession.

 Much of the research already conducted in the area of the economics of  immigration shows that on balance, the effect is marginally positive.

 The evidence produced by both Professor Nevile and Professor Withers  suggest that an immigration program of a size and composition which places  the balance in favour of more skilled migrants, need not sufficiently concern 

 us in terms of any adverse affect it may have on macro-economic indicators.

 Professor Parmenter lends qualified support to this view, arguing that data  and modelling deficiencies preclude making too confident a conclusion.

 Dr Birrell, on the other hand, is somewhat more sceptical.

 He points out that a combination of industry restructuring and a tax system  which favours investment in non-tradeable goods, will impact heavily on the  structure of the labour market to the detriment of migrants.

 The traditional areas of migrant employment, such as manufacturing will be  most adversely affected and present bleak prospects for the continued  absorption of low-skilled migrants in this area of the labour market in the  future.

 Furthermore, Dr Birrell contends that as Australia does not have the pre­ requisites for industry development into hi-tech areas, employment  opportunities here will also be limited.

 Birrell raises another issue which I have addressed in other fora and that is  that the importing of skilled labour may remove the incentive for Australian  employers to provide education and training programs for their own  workers.

 Indeed, immigration should not be seen as a means whereby industry should  seek to abrogate its responsibilities to train and re-skill workers. The present  migration regulations require that any company seeking to recruit a worker  under the Employer Nomination Scheme have a sound training record and  programs in place which will enable workers to meet the future needs of the

 company. Compliance with this requirement is something that should be  enforced.

 My view is, and I have stated this on several occasions, that many of the  problems associated with immigration in macro-economic areas such as  wages, unemployment, inflation or the current account, as well as other  areas such as the environment, urban infrastructure, and industry 

 restructuring, are not going to be solved by making immigration the  scapegoat. These problems need to be directly addressed at the source.  This issue has also been acknowledged by some contributors.

 A s many analysts have pointed out, immigration is not a suitable tool for  short term economic management.

 This however does not relieve us of the responsibility to review programs  constructively at a time when those policies are seen as creating an  environment where the level of immigration is blamed for the quite serious  outcomes current fiscal and monetary policies are producing.

 It seems to me that the dispute about whether or not we continue a high  level of immigration in bad economic times hinges on the question of the  composition of the intake rather than the numbers.

 A more skilled, younger, more employable and educated intake will improve  the economic benefits which accrue from immigration. There seems to be  little argument on this proposition - except with the ACTU.

 However, this is not to say that we would support a dramatic increase in the  immigration program, no matter how skilled.

 When thinking about the "number" of Australia's immigration program, other  things also need to be considered.

 We have to take into account the level of support and settlement services  which we can make available to migrants when they come here. In other  words we have to consider the capacity of the economy to absorb migrants.

 We must utilise the vast investment in skills, education and qualifications  which migrants bring with them. English language training and provision of  labour market bridging courses, access to education to upgrade skills,  mechanisms to facilitate the recognition of qualifications gained overseas -

 all these measures will unlock a reservoir of resources that we currently  seem unable or reluctant to draw upon.

 The importance of this was recognised in the Liberal Party's Economic  Action Plan last year when settlement programs were retained without cuts  to proposed expenditure.

 It is only by providing these kinds of services that we can augment the  economic benefits of immigration and ensure that the program can be  economically and politically sustainable at a reasonable level over the long  term. This takes a fair amount of forward planning and depends on  achieving an outcome that has been carefully constructed.

 This means that we have to have a large degree of control over the  immigration program. Something which we do not have now.

 It seems to me that the sorts of arguments we are facing now against an  immigration program arise because it is quite obvious to everyone that the  current program is out of control in many areas. We have an outcome that  was in no way planned and this is placing an undue strain on our resources.

 In the area of sham marriages for example, numbers applying for residence  on these grounds quite clearly indicated that this was an area of abuse. I do  acknowledge now, that the government has acted in relation to change of  status arrangements on shore.

 In the area of Refugee determination the latest figures show that there are  over 17,500 applications already in the system and this, I believe is rapidly  increasing. The figure admitted to by the Government is in the order of 1000  new applications per month. The real figure I believe is much higher,  possibly reaching 1000 a week.

 A number of inept and emotional decisions along with administrative failures  have led to a situation where the immigration program is running under a  momentum of its own.

 These are some of the considerations we have to bear in mind when we talk  about an immigration program for Australia.

 This does not mean that further research into the economic effects of  immigration is not required. It most certainly is. As Professor Parmenter

 u

 notes in this publication, and others have noted elsewhere, there is still the  question of the long-run economic effects of immigration which need to be  addressed.

 Other areas too need investigation. The unplanned element of our  immigration program - in terms of a large illegal population or an  unexpected influx of a large number of refugees for example -as well as  temporary entrants and visitors, have significant effects on domestic and  economic policy which have not been given due attention. Neither has the  extent of the costs which a large and increasing emigration rate may have  on the economy and industry development.

 The challenge is to "get our own house in order", in terms of putting in  place economic policies which will ensure an expanded capacity to  successfully settle a larger number of migrants in the long term, while also 

 meeting our current responsibilities to those who have already settled here.

 It gives me great pleasure now to officially present to you a work which  represents a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate on the Costs and  Benefits of Immigration.

 I would like to take this opportunity to personally congratulate the authors  for their long-standing commitment to rigorous and sensible debate on these  complex and controversial issues and look forward to the challenge of their  future publications.
