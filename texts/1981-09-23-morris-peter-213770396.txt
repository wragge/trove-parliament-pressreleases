A C T .  2 6 0 0  TEL. 721211STATEMENT BY PETER MORRIS, MHR, SHADOW MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT Canberra 23 September, 1981DEPARTMENT "CASHES IN" ON IMMIGRANTSThe Government has embarked on a course of converting the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs into a profitable business."Some $57.1M will be raised from various sources in 1981/82 by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. This is not a widely publicised fact" said Mr Peter Morris in reply to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.According to Mr Morris in the current financial year $34M will be raised from Departure Tax; $16.5M from Migrant Hostels; $12M in overseas student charges; $260,000 in processing of various applications;$3.3M from miscelaneous services; $65,000 from english language tests; $650,000 from Assisted Migrant Contributions and now additional charges will be introduced for interpreting and translating."Is it not sufficient that many of the immigrants and refugees arriving in Australia take up some of the most menial and dirty jobs, are they now expected to pay for the services provided for them" Mr Morris asked.Members of our immigrant communities would like to know what advantage the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in particular, or ethnic communities in general, will derive from the restoration of historical buildings in Victoria. '"I would like to know what advantage will the Department of Immigration in particular, or the ethnic communities in general have from the refurbishing of historical Victorian buildings" Mr Morris asked.Mr Morris said that the translating and interpreting services have come under repeated criticism the last few years."Four years after the establishment of N.A.A.T.I. the certification provided by the Authority has no legal status whatsoever" Mr Morris said"In the last 3 years some 300,000 immigrants and refugees and an additional 1,000,000 tourists and visitors came to this country. Yet we must be the only country in the world where, in our airports, bus terminals and internal air services there are no interpreters or translators available to guide and inform these people" Mr Morris said.' - . . . / I

 The shortage of interpreters and translators has been caused by  Government policies, not a lack of talent.

 "Unless urgent measures are taken to upgrade the present interpreting  and translating services - and therefore the Accrediting Authority -  the end result of the Government 'savings’  might be a return to the  pre-1973 years and return to the 'rackets' where poor and unknowing 

 immigrants and refugees are exploited by unqualified interpreters  and improvised translators charging exorbitant fees.
