 TRANSCRIPT 

 TONY BURKE MP   

 Member for Watson 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration 

 

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA  THURSDAY 10 AUGUST 2006  Subject:  Migration Amendment Designated Unauthorised Arrivals Bill.   

 E&OE-PROOF ONLY   

 

 Tony Burke:  We’ve received information overnight that at 12.30pm today the  Government will be gagging the Bill and gagging any further debate on the migration  amendments.   

 This Government spent weeks and weeks consulting with Indonesia, making sure every  Indonesian argument was heard and the Prime Minister can’t put up with Australian  Members of Parliament talking for more than a day.   

 It’s typical of the fact the Government knows these laws are weak; knows these laws are  an appeasement of another country and doesn’t want the argument to be told, doesn’t  want the story on the record.   

 Every Australian Member of Parliament, if they are allowed to speak on any issue, it  ought to be on one that undermines our sovereignty the way this Bill does.   

 The debate will be gagged, it will go to a vote and then the Government will crunch it  through in the vote when we get to the Senate next week.  Exactly what the outcome will  be in the Senate, I still don’t know.  But I do know that this Bill never should have been  brought before the Australian Parliament in the first place.  If we were in the Indonesian  Parliament, it would pass easily but it should never pass here.   

 Journalist:  Do you think Judith Troeth is probably under intense pressure at the moment?   Do you expect she is copping it from all sides from within the Liberal Party?   

 Tony Burke:  I think there have been enough comments on and off the record from others  in the Liberal Party to say that is what is going on.     

 Journalist:  Do you think she will buckle to that pressure?   

 Tony Burke:  I don’t know her well enough I’ve got to say.  I don’t know.  I haven’t been  involved in directly lobbying any Members of the Coalition.  The only non-Labor  Member of Parliament I’ve had extensive talks with was Steve Fielding.  And as I said to 

 you yesterday, that was left in an inconclusive way.  I am not able to give a punt on what  the odds are of people voting different ways.  I’m still astonished that this Bill has come  before us in the first place.  There’s no demand within Australia for a law like this.   

 Journalist:  Were you disappointed that the chicken man stunt took a bit of the attention  off the division in the Government yesterday?   

 Tony Burke:  I think the only reason that stunt took place was because of division within  the Government over leadership.  There’s division at all levels.  There’s division over this  Bill, there’s division over leadership.  We can’t control which element of the mess within  the Coalition is going to be reported from day-to-day.  But certainly I can’t say that there  has been a lack of reporting about the problems with this Migration Bill.   

 Journalist:  Is the gagging of debate typical of the way the Government has handled  dissent over the past few years?   

 Tony Burke:  It is typical, although it is rare for the gag to get to the extent where you get  about 24 hours of debate.  In terms of the clock and in terms of actual numbers of  speeches you usually would expect to get much more time than this.   And I think part of  it’s to do with the fact they couldn’t find many Government back-benchers to stand up  and defend the Bill.  They only had 11 speakers on the list. They’ve got through 10 of  them so far and 4 of them have spoken our way.
