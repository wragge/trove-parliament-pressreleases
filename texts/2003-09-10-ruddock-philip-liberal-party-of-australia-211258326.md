 Philip Ruddock MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 

 Work Starts on the Port Augusta Residential Housing Project

 MPS 64/2003

 Work commenced today on the establishment of a Residential Housing Project (RHP) at Ellis Close, Port Augusta West, the  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, announced today.

 Work was able to start following the conclusion of negotiations with the South Australian Government for the purchase of  land. 

 'The Port Augusta RHP will be similar in nature to the RHP in Woomera providing capacity for around 40 eligible women and  children,' Mr Ruddock said.

 'I anticipate that the RHP will be ready for occupation in early November.'

 A contractor was already engaged to manage the uplift, transportation and installation of transportable houses and complete  minor works including landscaping and commissioning. 

 The RHP will comprise nine 3-bedroom single storey transportable houses from Woomera. The houses will accommodate  different family compositions. At least one will be modified to accommodate residents with disabilities. One house will be  utilised as an administration centre for the RHP.

 Each house is fully self contained to enable independent living with small outdoor areas adjacent to each house to give some  level of privacy without interfering with security.

 The RHP will also include grassed areas for recreation, easy care gardens, a communal recreation area with a BBQ and  shade/weather shelter with paving and outdoor furniture. There will also be a shaded playground for children.

 Plans and artists' impressions of the RHP are available for viewing at the Port Augusta City Council Chambers and the Town  Library.

 'Following the success of the RHP in Woomera and with the development of Port Augusta's RHP I will continue to explore  opportunities to establish alternative detention arrangements in the vicinity of other detention facilities,' Mr Ruddock said.

 'I thank the Port Augusta Community, the Council and the South Australian Government for their assistance to date in  bringing the RHP to fruition,' the Minister said.
