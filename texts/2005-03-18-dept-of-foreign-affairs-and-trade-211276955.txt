 AUSTRALIA-INDONESIA MINISTERIAL FORUM  

 AND AUSTRALIA-INDONESIA DEVELOPMENT  AREA MINISTERIAL MEETING 

 CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA, 18 MARCH 2005   

 JOINT MINISTERIAL STATEMENT 

 

 The  seventh  meeting  of  the  Australia-Indonesia  Ministerial  Forum  and  the  fifth  Ministerial   meeting of the Australia-Indonesia Development Area (AIDA) were held in Canberra on 18  March  2005.   The  Indonesian  delegation  was  led  by  HE  Aburizal  Bakrie,  Coordinating   Minister  for  Economic  Affairs.  The  Australian  delegation  was  led  by  the  

 Hon  Alexander  Downer  MP,  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs.   The  Indonesian  and  Australian   delegations are at Annex A.   

 2. Ministers noted the Ministerial Forum meeting had given further impetus to an already  strong bilateral relationship, with a range of new cooperative initiatives announced. Ministers  highlighted  the  breadth  of  the  relationship  as  well  as  the  expansion  of  practical  bilateral   cooperation  on  key  issues  of  shared  concern. The  26  December  2004  tsunami  which   devastated  Aceh  and  Northern  Sumatra  and  the  quick  and  generous  Australian  response   demonstrated  not  only  that  Australia  and  Indonesia  are  close  neighbours,  but  also  strong   partners.  This joint relief effort had opened a new chapter in bilateral relations, building on a  very strong foundation of bilateral engagement.    

 3. Ministers  underlined  that  Australia  and  Indonesia  share  many  key  political,  security   and  economic  interests.   Australia  and  Indonesia’s  prosperity,  security  and  stability  are   inextricably  linked.   Indonesian  Ministers  proposed  for  future  discussion  a  comprehensive   plan  to  further  advance  links  between  Australia  and  Indonesia.  Ministers  reiterated  their   strong  commitment  to  working  closely  together  to  combat  terrorism.   Ministers  also   reaffirmed  their  support  for  trade  liberalisation  and  economic  reform.   Australia’s  development assistance program for Indonesia is making a significant contribution to security,  economic  reform  and  in  support  of  Indonesia’s  democratic  transition.  Ministers  welcomed   bilateral  initiatives  on  counter-terrorism,  including  transport  security  and  customs  capacity-building;  anti-money  laundering;  electoral  assistance;  and  Interfaith  cooperation.   Ministers  underlined  the  importance  of  continuing  to  strengthen  people-to-people  contacts,  including   education  links.  Ministers  welcomed  the  intention  to  sign  a  new  Treaty  on  Science  and   Technology Collaboration, which is expected to enhance scientific cooperation in many fields,  particularly in the food and energy sectors.    

 PARTNERS FOR DEVELOPMENT 

 Supporting Indonesia’s democratic and economic transition 

 4.  Australian  Ministers  congratulated  their  Indonesian  counterparts  on  the  successful   conduct of parliamentary elections and the country’s first direct Presidential elections in 2004.   This  was  an  important  step  in  the  consolidation  of  Indonesia’s  democratic  transition.   The   A$15  million  committed  by  Australia  to  support  the  organisation  of  the  elections  was  

  1

 

 appreciated.   Indonesian  Ministers  also  welcomed  Australia’s  willingness  to  provide   assistance  with  the  holding  of  gubernatorial  and  local  level  elections  in  Indonesia  in  2005.    Australian  Ministers  announced  they  would  host  a  visit  by  the  Indonesian  Parliamentary   Committee  on  Defence,  Foreign  Relations  and  Information  (Commission  I)  this  year.    Australian Ministers also noted their willingness to fund a study visit to Australia by members  of Indonesia’s new Assembly of Regional Representatives, the DPD.  

 5.  Australian  Ministers  supported special autonomy in Papua and Aceh as the best way  of meeting the needs of local communities within the context of a stable and unitary state of  Indonesia.   They  underscored  Australia’s  support  for  Indonesia’s  territorial  integrity.    Ministers noted the Australian Government had instituted guidelines for NGOs in Indonesia  that  prevent  funding  of  organisations  that  operate  contrary  to  the  laws  and  policies  of   Australia  and  Indonesia.   Australian  Ministers  agreed  to  investigate  any  evidence  of  pro-independence activities by NGOs that it funds in Indonesia.  Indonesia undertook to provide  information on any such claims.  

 6. Ministers commended Indonesia’s recent economic progress, including the completion  of its IMF program in December 2003.  Ministers recognised that ongoing economic reform  was  essential  for  countries  to  meet  the  challenges  and  reap  the  benefits  of  globalisation.   Australian  Ministers  noted  that  reforms  in  Australia  had  served  Australia  well  and  solid   growth was again expected in 2005.  Indonesian Ministers underlined their commitment to an  extensive  economic  reform  program.   Australian  Ministers  welcomed  the  anti-corruption   agenda  of  the  Indonesian  Government  and  underlined  Australia’s  continued  willingness  to   support  good  governance  initiatives,  including  through  additional  assistance  to  Indonesia’s   anti-corruption court, and the Partnership for Governance Reform.     

 Australian Development Cooperation Program   

 7. Indonesian Ministers welcomed the 33 per cent increase in the bilateral development  cooperation program over the past two years to A$160.8 million.  This will augment existing  support  in  the  critical  areas  of  economic  reform  and  governance,  health,  education,  legal,   human  rights  and  judicial  reform.   Ministers  noted  the  importance  of  the  support  for   advancing Indonesia’s reform program.  Indonesian Ministers welcomed Australia’s increased  support  for  basic  education  which  was  an  investment  in  Indonesia’s  future  prosperity.    Australia’s  major  scholarship  program  was  making  a  significant  contribution  to  Indonesia’s   human resource development.  Ministers expressed deep concern about the growing problem  of  communicable  diseases,  including  HIV/AIDS,  in  Indonesia,  and  welcomed  the  increased   focus  through  Australia’s  development  cooperation  program  on  this  issue  in  our  health   program. Australia’s development cooperation program would continue to have a significant  focus on Eastern Indonesia.   

 Australian Post-Tsunami Humanitarian Assistance   

 8. Australian Ministers expressed condolences to Indonesia over the 26 December Indian  Ocean  tsunami  and  the  human  tragedy  suffered  in  Aceh  and  Northern  Sumatra.   Indonesian   Ministers thanked Australia for the government's initial humanitarian relief response including  Australian  Defence  Force  personnel  and  equipment,  civilian  medical  teams,  disaster   management  expertise,  and  immediate  air-freight  of  food,  water  and  medical  supplies.    Ministers  acknowledged  the  Australian  Government’s  commitment  of  A$33  million  to  the   Indonesian relief effort, and over 1,000 tonnes of emergency humanitarian aid which has been  provided  to  tsunami  victims  in  Indonesia.   Ministers  applauded  the  efforts  and  generous  

  2

 

 donations  of  the  Australian  people,  NGOs  and  corporate  sector  and  Australia’s  strong  role   amongst the international community in helping the Indonesian Government.     

 

 Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development   

 9.  Ministers  welcomed  the  establishment  of  the  Australia-Indonesia  Partnership  for   Reconstruction  and  Development  (AIPRD),  which  presents  an  historic  opportunity  to  bring   the people of Australia and Indonesia closer together to support Indonesia’s recovery from the  tremendous  damage  wreaked  by  the  tsunami.   Through  the  Partnership,  A$1  billion  will  be   committed over five years for reconstruction and development efforts both in Aceh and North  Sumatra, as well as in Indonesia more broadly.  Out of the destruction caused by the tsunami,  Ministers look forward to working in close cooperation to build a new future and to continue  to  strengthen  the  relationship  between  Australia  and  Indonesia.  Ministers  welcomed  the   decision of the first AIPRD Joint Commission, held in association with the Ministerial Forum,  to  agree  to  a  set  of  principles  to  guide  implementation  of  the  AIPRD  and  on  early  priority   activities for funding, including investments in the health system in Aceh and assistance with  critical disaster preparedness and disaster management arrangements in Indonesia.   

 Development of a Tsunami Early Warning System for the Indian Ocean Region    

 10.  Ministers  emphasised  the  importance  of  efforts  to  develop  a  tsunami  early  warning   system for the Indian Ocean region, as agreed at the Special Leaders’ Meeting of ASEAN on  the  Aftermath  of  the  Earthquake  and  Tsunamis  hosted  by  Indonesia  in  January.   They   welcomed initial progress made towards implementing this agreement through the UN World  Conference on Disaster Reduction hosted by Japan and at other meetings held in the region.   Ministers  welcomed  the  Indonesia-Australia  initial  scientific  works  to  monitor  the  Eastern   Indian Ocean, Timor Sea and Arafura Sea and its contribution to the establishment of TEWS.  Ministers reaffirmed their support for an architecture that would allow national tsunami early  warning  systems  to  be  networked,  with  several  sub-regional  tsunami  early  warning  centres.    Ministers  agreed  to  work  together  and  with  other  Indian  Ocean  countries  to  expeditiously   develop  such  a  system  under  the  coordination  of  UNESCO’s  Intergovernmental   Oceanographic  Commission.   They  welcomed  the  many  generous  offers  of  financial  and   technical assistance made by countries across the globe to help establish such a system.   

 WORKING TOGETHER FOR REGIONAL SECURITY   

 11.  Ministers  acknowledged  their  shared  goal  of  peace  and  security  in  the  region.    Ministers noted the excellent cooperation between the various agencies in both countries on  achieving this goal.  Ministers condemned the bombing targeting the Australian Embassy in  Jakarta  on  9  September  2004  and  commended  the  continued  efforts  in  bringing  to  justice   those responsible.   

 Terrorism   

 12. Ministers condemned in the strongest terms acts of terrorism, including attacks on the  Australian Embassy and the Marriott Hotel and in  Bali,  which  have  claimed  many  innocent   lives.  Ministers acknowledged that terrorism continued to pose a serious threat to the region’s  peace,  security  and  economic  prosperity.   Ministers  noted  that  a  sustained  and  concerted  

  3

 

 regional  counter-terrorism  effort  would  be  required  for  the  long  term  and  reaffirmed  their   strong commitment to fight terrorism.     

 13.  Ministers  welcomed  the  excellent  cooperation  between  Indonesian  and  Australian   police,  intelligence  and  security  agencies  in  combating  terrorism  and  highlighted  the   importance of their ongoing efforts.  This would remain a major bilateral priority. Ministers  welcomed  the  launch  and  role  of  the  Jakarta  Centre  for  Law  Enforcement  Cooperation   (JCLEC)  in  developing  the  capacity  of  regional  law  enforcement  agencies  to  combat   transnational crime and terrorism.  Ministers commended the work of the Law Enforcement  Working  Group  and  the  Legal  Issues  Working  Group,  established  by  the  Bali  Regional   Ministers Meeting on Counter-Terrorism in February 2004, and looked forward to the reports  from both groups later in 2005.     

 14.  Australian  Ministers  reiterated  the  Australian  Government’s  commitment  to  support   the  development  of  regional  capacity  to  fight  terrorism  and  noted  the  decision  to  double   Australia’s  counter-terrorism  assistance  to  Indonesia.   Ministers  commended  Australia-   Indonesia  transport  security  capacity-building  initiatives  which  will  facilitate  Indonesia’s   ability  to  establish  its  own  security  training  programs.   They  welcomed  the  February  2005   commencement  of  customs  capacity-building  assistance  to  enhance  Indonesian  Customs’   intelligence  development  and  port  and  ship  search  and  surveillance  capabilities.   Ministers   expressed  a  hope  that  the  Arrangement  on  the  Joint  Australia-Indonesia  Aviation  Security   Capacity-Building  Project  could  be  signed  as  soon  as  possible.   Australia  is  also  providing   significant  assistance  for  enhancing  Indonesia’s  border  control  passenger  movement  alert   checking  system.   Ministers  expressed  appreciation  of  a  strong  and  ongoing  extradition  and   mutual assistance relationship, notwithstanding the differences between legal systems.   

 Travel Advisories   

 15.   Indonesian  Ministers  requested  that  the  Australian  Government  reconsider  its  travel   advisory  for  Indonesia,  and  were  concerned  about  its  effect  on  the  economy.   Australian   Ministers  reemphasized  that  Australian  travel  advisories  remain  under  constant  review.    Ministers  noted  the  ongoing  cooperation  on  counter-terrorism,  including  information   exchange  and  agreed  to  continue  to  strengthen  this  cooperation.   Ministers  agreed  that   officials would meet to discuss further such cooperation.    

 Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing    

 16.  Ministers  expressed  their  commitment  to  eliminating  money  laundering  and  terrorist   financing in our region.  Ministers welcomed the announcement by the Financial Action Task  Force  (FATF)  that  Indonesia  has  been  delisted  from  FATF’s  list  of  Non-Cooperative   Countries and Territories.  They noted the significant steps taken by Indonesia to strengthen  its anti-money laundering regime and to address issues raised by FATF in its letter.  Ministers  welcomed  the  Memorandum  of  Understanding  signed  in  February  2004  between  the   Indonesian Financial Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (PPATK) and AUSTRAC on  Cooperation  in  the  Exchange  of  Financial  Intelligence.   Support  for  anti-money  laundering   initiatives  in  Indonesia  will  remain  a  key  focus  for  Australian  assistance,  with  Australian   Ministers  announcing  an  additional  A$2  million  for  anti-money  laundering  and  combating   terrorist financing capacity-building assistance.

 People Smuggling and Trafficking   

 17.  Ministers  noted  that  people  smuggling  and  trafficking  remained  threats  to  national   security.   However,  they  recognised  that  the  determined  and  effective  bilateral  cooperation   between  law  enforcement  and  immigration  authorities  had  contributed  to  a  significant   reduction in maritime people smuggling activities.  Ministers also expressed satisfaction with  continued close bilateral cooperation between Australia and Indonesia as co-chairs of the Bali  Process  on  People  Smuggling,  Trafficking  in  Persons  and  related  Transnational  Crime.    Ministers  noted  that  the  Bali  Process  continued  to  provide  an  excellent  framework  for   regional  cooperation.  Practical  activities  successfully  delivered  under  the  Bali  Process  over   the  last  year  included  law  enforcement  targeting  of  people  smugglers  and  traffickers,  the   development  of  bilateral  arrangements  on  the  return  of  unlawful  migrants,  reconciling   legitimate  state  interest  to  control  immigration  with  refugee  protection,  best  practices  in   operational cooperation and the protection of victims of trafficking in persons.  Ministers also  noted  the  effective  bilateral  cooperation  between  the  Directorate-General  of  Immigration  at   the  Department  of  Law  and  Human  Rights  and  the  Department  of  Immigration  and   Multicultural  and  Indigenous  Affairs  and  the  valuable  work  of  the  Joint  Working  Group  on   Immigration  in  areas  such  as  strengthening  border  management  and  information  sharing  to   deterring  illegal  people  movements.  Ministers  underlined  the  importance  they  attached  to   criminalising people smuggling.     

 Illegal Fishing   

 18.  Ministers exchanged views on the new Australian  policy  of  rapid  repatriation  within   the  context  of  article  73  of  the  1982  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea   (UNCLOS) and agreed that officials hold further discussions on these issues.    

 19.  Ministers reiterated their agreement that illegal fishing is a growing concern for both  countries, as it threatens the livelihoods of our coastal communities and damages our natural  environment.  They  further  agreed  that  illegal  fishermen  should  be  treated  humanely,  and   noted  Australia’s  plan  to  establish  a  land-based  detention  centre.   Ministers  agreed  that   officials would hold further discussions on each Government’s concerns about illegal fishing.   

 Perth Treaty   

 20. Ministers noted the importance of the 1997 Perth Treaty entering into force as soon as  practical, acknowledging some work needed to be undertaken.    

 Non-Proliferation and Disarmament   

 21.  Ministers  supported  adoption  of  UN  Security  Council  Resolution  1540  in  line  with   Article  25  of  the  UN  Charter,  and  non-proliferation  commitments  in  the  Bangkok  and   Santiago APEC Leaders Declarations and undertook to work together to enhance measures for  preventing  the  proliferation  of  WMD  and  missile-related  materials  and  technologies,   including export controls.  The co-hosting of a regional workshop on the Biological Weapons  Convention  in  Melbourne  in  February  2005  was  a  tangible  demonstration  of  this  joint   commitment.     

  5

 

 22. Ministers agreed that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) remained essential  to  international  efforts  to  prevent  the  spread  of  nuclear  weapons,  advance  nuclear   disarmament  and  facilitate  access  to  the  peaceful  uses  of  nuclear  energy.   They  emphasised   the  importance  of  NPT  parties  working  together  at  the  2005  NPT  Review  Conference  to   maintain and strengthen the NPT.  Ministers agreed that global application of the Additional  Protocol on strengthened IAEA safeguards would reinforce the non-proliferation regime and  contribute to a climate conducive to further progress on nuclear disarmament.  They noted the  Asia-Pacific  Nuclear  Safeguards  and  Security  Ministerial  Conference  held  in  Sydney  in   November 2004 had made an important contribution in galvanising regional efforts to expand  and enhance the nuclear safeguards and security framework, including to combat the threat of  nuclear terrorism.   

 DEEPENING OUR UNDERSTANDING AND TOLERANCE   

 23. Ministers commended the joint Interfaith Dialogue initiative, opened by Dr Wirajuda  and  Mr  Downer  in  Yogyakarta  on  6-7  December  2004,  which  brought  together  a  range  of   faith and community leaders from across the region.  Importantly, delegates jointly delivered  key messages to regional faith communities, including their strong commitment to fostering  peace  and  respect  for  religious  diversity  in  the  region  and  underscored  the  message  that   violence  and  terrorism  had  no  basis  in  religious  values.  The  Interfaith  Dialogue  also  agreed   that  empowerment  of  the  moderates  at  all  levels  of  society  was  necessary. Ministers  welcomed  the  proposed  Yogyakarta  International  Centre  for  Religious  and  Cultural   Cooperation  that  would  complement  such  a  goal.   Given  the  success  of  the  Yogyakarta   meeting and the need to ensure that those who support peace and tolerance set the agenda in  the region, Ministers announced that Australia and Indonesia would jointly organise another  Interfaith Dialogue meeting, possibly in conjunction with another regional partner. 

 BUILDING STRONG TRADE AND INVESTMENT LINKS   

 24. Ministers underscored their commitment to trade liberalisation, noting the significant  benefits  it  had  brought  to  both  their  countries.   Ministers  reaffirmed  their  commitment  to   lower  tariffs  and  other  barriers  to  trade  so  that  Indonesian  and  Australian  exporters  and   consumers continued to benefit.  Ministers welcomed the continued recovery in trade between 

 the  two  countries,  with  two-way  trade  increasing  to  A$8.49  billion  in  2004.   Ministers   welcomed  the  contribution  of  the  two  Business  Councils  and  their  efforts  in  broadening  the   bilateral relationship.  The Business Dialogue Forum with Australian and Indonesian business  had resulted in substantial discussion on key bilateral commercial issues and on possible areas  for  further  economic  linkages.   Ministers  looked  forward  to  the  Joint  Business  Councils’   meeting and annual Trade Ministers’ Meeting in Bali in April.   

 25.  Ministers  welcomed  progress  on  initiatives  stemming  from  the  annual  Trade   Ministers’  Meeting  which  included  the  Australia-Indonesia  Automotive  Summit,  production   of  an  investment  guide  for  the  Indonesian  agribusiness  sector  and  the  Australia-Indonesia   Investment Group.  Such initiatives will bring further trade and investment opportunities for  companies  from  both  countries.   Australian  Ministers  noted  Australia  would  continue  its   program of trade policy training for Indonesian officials.  Ministers agreed to discuss further  support for SME development.     

 26. Ministers welcomed the growing links in legal co-operation between the two countries  and the wide range of work continuing under the Working Group on Legal Co-operation.

 ASEAN-Australia and New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (FTA)   

 27.  Ministers  welcomed  the  decision  by  Leaders  at  the  ASEAN-Australia  and   New  Zealand  Commemorative  Summit  in  Vientiane  on  30  November  2004,  to  launch   negotiations on a free trade agreement.  They also welcomed Leaders’ endorsement of the set  of FTA negotiating principles including a commitment to an FTA that was comprehensive in  scope,  covering  trade  in  goods,  services  and  investment,  and  that  provided  for  technical   assistance  and  capacity  building  to  enable  all  parties  to  benefit  fully  from  the  agreement.    They  acknowledged  the  FTA  would  provide  added  impetus  to  the  already  strong  trade   linkages  between  Australia  and  Indonesia  and  offered  scope  to  strengthen  investment  ties.    Ministers welcomed the commencement of negotiations in Melbourne in February 2005.    

 World Trade Organization (WTO)   

 28.  Ministers  placed  the  highest  priority  on  the  successful  conclusion  to  the  WTO  Doha   Round of trade negotiations, stressing that the WTO membership will need to work together  to ensure an ambitious result consistent with the Doha mandate.  Such a result would make a  substantial  contribution  to  economic  growth  and  development  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region.    Ministers agreed that to achieve significant progress by the Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting in  December  2005,  it  was  necessary  to  aim  for  concrete  progress  in  key  negotiations  on   agriculture and on industrial products and to achieve a critical mass of high-quality services  offers  -  noting  the  May  2005  deadline  for  revised  services  offers.   Ministers  strongly   supported work to ensure the development dimension of the Doha Round was appropriately  and  effectively  represented  across  the  negotiations.   The  need  for  technical  assistance  and   capacity-building  was  highlighted  to  continue  to  support  developing  country  efforts  to   participate  in  the  negotiations  and  implement  WTO  obligations.   Australia  and  Indonesia   agreed that to secure these results they and other WTO Ministers should use every opportunity,  including through APEC, to promote real progress in the Round during 2005.   

 29. Ministers acknowledged the ongoing importance of the Cairns Group in pressing for a  substantial  outcome  in  the  negotiations  on  agriculture.   It  is  expected  that  the  Cairns  Group   would  support  special  and  differential  treatment  for  developing  countries  having  regard  for   their rural development, food security and or livelihood security needs.  Ministers noted that  the  forthcoming  Cairns  Group  Ministerial  Meeting  in  Colombia  from  30  March  to  1  April,   would provide a timely opportunity to consider ways to progress the negotiations this year.   

 APEC   

 30. Ministers noted the importance of APEC as a key regional forum and reiterated their  commitment  to  APEC’s  trade  and  investment  liberalisation  objectives  and  to  its  valuable   economic  and  technical  cooperation  work.   Ministers  agreed  to  enhance  cooperation  in  the   lead  up  to  Australia  hosting  APEC  in  2007.   They  emphasised  that  both  Indonesia  and   Australia  were  looking  for  APEC  to  make  a  strong  political  contribution  to  the  WTO  Doha   Round  and  enhance  its  important  capacity-building  work  on  trade  liberalisation  and   facilitation,  counter-terrorism  and  human  security  issues.  Ministers  welcomed  Indonesia’s    hosting  of  the  2nd  APEC  Oceans-Related  Ministerial  Meeting  (2nd  AOMM)  in  Bali  in   September 2005.

 AUSTRALIA-INDONESIA DEVELOPMENT AREA (AIDA)   

 31. Ministers noted that the further development of AIDA rested primarily with the private  sector.  Ministers announced a review of AIDA which should provide the impetus for other  private  sector  activity.   Australian  Ministers  highlighted  that  the  Australian  development   assistance  program  had  a  major  focus  on  underdeveloped  regions  of  Eastern  Indonesia,   including  through  the  new  A$30  million  Australia  Nusa  Tenggara  Assistance  for  Regional   Autonomy  (ANTARA)  initiative.   The  five  year  ANTARA  program  will  assist  with   improving  regional  governance,  increasing  incomes  and  building  better  basic  services.   Australian  Ministers  also  noted  the  ongoing  implementation  of  the  five  year  A$4  million   program  for  SME  assistance  in  Eastern  Indonesia.   Ministers  welcomed  the  Australian   announcement  that  funds  from  the  Australia-Indonesia  Partnership  for  Reconstruction  and   Development could be targeted to develop the areas covered by AIDA.  The commitment of  the  Australia-Indonesia  Business  Council  and  the  Indonesia-Australia  Business  Council  to   provide technical assistance to SMEs in the region was an excellent initiative.   

 32.  Ministers noted the Working Group reports at Annex B.   

 DATES  AND  VENUE  FOR  THE  EIGHTH  MINISTERIAL  FORUM  AND  SIXTH   AIDA MINISTERIAL MEETING   

 33.  Ministers concluded that the  seventh  meeting  of  the  Australia-Indonesia  Ministerial   Forum  had  been  of  substantial  value.   They  welcomed  the  opportunities  it  had  provided  for   both countries to reaffirm their mutual commitment to building the bilateral relationship and  in developing concrete proposals to take this forward.  Ministers acknowledged the important  contribution made by their respective business communities to the success of the forum. 

 

 34.  Ministers  agreed  that  the  eighth  Ministerial  Forum  and  the  sixth  AIDA  meeting  is   tentatively scheduled to be held in Indonesia in 2006.
