 Address to symposium  ‘How Muslim communities have integrated into the wider Australian  community’  

 Islamic Council of Victoria and Department of Family and Community  Services and Indigenous Affairs 

 Melbourne  23 February 2007 

 Distinguished guests, other speakers, ladies and gentlemen 

 I am delighted to be here this evening at the inaugural symposium and I thank  the organisers - the Islamic Council of Victoria and the Department of  Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. 

 This week will mark my first three weeks as Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, and I appreciate very much the  opportunity to introduce myself and meet with you. 

 I want to congratulate all the people who have worked so hard to develop this  symposium. My department is really pleased to be closely involved with the  Bringing Communities Together strategy. 

 Tonight, I will talk to you about cultural diversity, shared national identity and  common values. 

 The change in the department’s name - particularly the replacement of  ‘multicultural affairs’ with ‘citizenship’ - has given rise to some anxiety and  misinformation in some communities concerning the Government’s intentions.  I have written to community leaders across Australia to reaffirm the  Government’s continued commitment to the effective integration of migrants  and refugees. In that letter I explained that the emphasis on citizenship in the  name of the department reflects the warm invitation we extend to those joining  our national family. Tonight’s symposium provides me with an opportunity to  elaborate on these issues.  

 Rumours of the ‘death’ of multiculturalism are greatly exaggerated. But  multiculturalism - as a term - has become redundant, let me explain what I  mean. 

 Many have grown attached to multiculturalism as a catch phrase or label,  while remaining unsure of its definition, and unconvinced of its benefits.  Multiculturalism, as a term, can be interpreted in any number of ways. In my  view, its very imprecision is a critical weakness. 

 On the first episode of the new ABC programme, Difference of Opinion, a  panel guest extolled a virtue of multiculturalism in Australia as being the  variety of foreign food we have to choose from. 

 As a first generation daughter of Italian migrants, I find that particular defence  of multiculturalism in Australia - in the context of an important national  discussion - to be trivial. 

 If that is all that ‘multiculturalism’ is, or describes, then that term does nothing  to describe the contribution and commitment of my parents to Australia. And  the term does nothing to honour the contributions made by other Australians  from culturally diverse backgrounds. The term can also trivialise the  achievements of Australia’s 300,000 Muslims and magnifies the perceived  distance of Australian Muslims from the rest of Australia. 

 Multiculturalism, as a word, can serve to distance us from ourselves. In my  view, I think multiculturalism as a label, is past its use-by date.   It doesn’t tell  us what we share in common, it doesn’t tell us who we are, it doesn’t tell us  what our values are, and it does not point the way toward continued national  prosperity. But I believe that its policy fundamentals are important and should  remain. 

 So let us celebrate unity within our cultural diversity. If Australia’s prosperity is  to continue to grow, if all our children are to inherit and build upon our labours,  then we have no option other than to unite behind a core set of common  values; a shared Australian identity. We should all celebrate our individual  backgrounds but we cannot afford to be confined by them. 

 We must commit to Australia as a whole. 

 Australia cannot be a nation of islands within an island. Together, we hope to  achieve a stronger, more united community. All of us here tonight agree that  those who come to Australia should unite behind a core set of values, a  shared Australian identity. We all know that. This is because we all recognise  that values are the key to character. 

 As Australians, whatever our background, age or country of birth, we are  united by shared values. The self-appointed elites are greatly amused by this  discussion. They disparagingly refer to the system of shouting beers in public  bars as signifying the evolutionary apogee of Australian values. 

 Again, the trivialisation of a serious discussion continues. They are the ones  suffering from the hangover of an out-dated cultural cringe. But you in the 

 audience know what these values are - for they are real values - not just  quirks of custom. 

 These shared values are respect for the freedom and dignity of the individual,  democracy, our commitment to the rule of law, freedom of speech and the  press, the equality of men and women, and the spirit of egalitarianism, which  embraces the uniquely Australian principle of the ‘Fair go’ which  encompasses mutual respect, honesty and compassion for those in need. 

 And there is absolutely no conflict between commitment to these Australian  values, of participating in the national identity, and fulfilling our respective  personal religious obligations. 

 Australia’s Muslims have demonstrated that there is no incompatibility  between a commitment to Islam and being Australian - and making a  constructive contribution to this country. 

 For Australia’s Muslims, there is no conflict between veils and vegemite. 

 We need to ensure that the new arrivals develop the English language skills  and a general understanding of our community, so that they might integrate  quickly and make the most of the opportunities available in Australia. 

 An ability to communicate in English is essential for integration and  participation of all migrants in broader Australian society. 

 Critics have argued that in the past, many migrants came to Australia without  much English and proved to be wonderful, productive citizens. 

 No one argues with that. 

 But things have changed over the last 30, 40, or 50 years. Gone are the days  when the majority of migrants worked in low-skill jobs and learned English on  the factory floor. 

 Australian society, and the Australian economy, has moved on. For migrants,  a functional command of English is now a pre-requisite for performance in a  21st century economy. Learning English can be difficult - I know this from  personal experience - but it is not an insurmountable hurdle, nor is it an  unreasonable expectation. 

 On the contrary, English language skills are personally empowering for new  arrivals - and the Government is committed to assisting their process of self-empowerment. This is because English language ability is a passport to  participation, a passport to prosperity. And English not only bridges the gap  between communities, it bridges the generation gap within our communities. 

 The government is working closely with Australia’s Muslim community, and  has established a number of collaborative partnerships to address strategic  national or regional issues. 

 You here tonight are familiar with, or have participated in these partnerships  and initiatives, so I won’t tell you what you already know about the 

 Government’s $55 million cultural diversity policies and programmes.  I also welcome the participation of key Australian organisations, such as Surf  Life Saving Australia, the Australian Sports Commission, the National Rugby  League and the Australian Football League, as well as the Guides and  Scouts, have been working to help create avenues for Australians - of all  backgrounds - to fully participate in, and contribute to, the broader community  and to truly integrate. 

 And I thank the Imams for their good work. Last year’s Conference of  Australian Imams was an historic moment. Their contribution to more rigorous  education and training initiatives in Australia are greatly appreciated.  Fifty per cent of Muslims in Australia are under 25 years of age, most of have  been born in Australia with English as their first language: the government has  encouraged Imams to reach out to these young people by giving their  sermons in English. 

 But all initiatives require commitment and involvement not just from  government agencies, but from the NGO sector, and from community leaders  involved in promoting and participating in these programmes and  partnerships. 

 As I mentioned earlier, the principle of the ‘Fair Go’ is a uniquely Australian  value.  A fair go, however, expects fair effort. Australians will always help  those in need but they rightly expect those receiving assistance to contribute  in return. 

 The Government will continue to support all migrants by ensuring they have  access to education, employment and involvement with mainstream  community activities. In return, the Government expects migrants to make the  effort to learn the language and the culture. It is in all of our interests. And it  will assist in developing greater understanding of Islam among the majority  non-Muslim population in Australia 

 Conclusion 

 Some are concerned that the Government is denying, or dispensing with,  Australia’s cultural diversity.  These fears are unfounded.  Cultural diversity is  a fact of Australian life. 

 There has been a change in language, and a change in emphasis. 

 As I mentioned earlier, the term ‘multiculturalism’ fails to explain the Australian  national identity, our shared values, and it does nothing to point the way  ahead. 

 It does nothing to explain the commitment and contribution of migrants to  Australia. 

 Instead, we should celebrate our cultural diversity and commitment to shared  Australian values.  And a great method of doing this is by ensuring we can all  speak to one another - in English, our national language. 

 I look forward to these symposia over the next seven months, and will be  interested to see what they produce and how they contribute to greater  understanding. 

 Together, we can do great things. 

 ENDS
