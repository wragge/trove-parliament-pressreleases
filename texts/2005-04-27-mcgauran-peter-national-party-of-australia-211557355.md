 Media Release 

 East Timorese Caseload

 27 April 2005

 Acting Minister for Immigration, Peter McGauran, today said that processing of Australia’s caseload of East Timorese  asylum seekers was almost complete.

 As a result of thorough assessments of each case, more than 1400 East Timorese have now been granted permanent visas  to remain in Australia.

 ‘Senator Vanstone and her predecessor Mr Ruddock took account of a range of reasons, including individual  circumstances, links in Australia, date of arrival in Australia and any character issues, in considering whether to exercise  their discretion in these cases,’ Minister McGauran said. 

 ‘I am pleased to announce that through Ministerial intervention, some 1440 people can get on with their new lives in  Australia.

 ‘In March 2002, the former Minister, Philip Ruddock announced that East Timorese asylum seekers in Australia would be  invited to provide additional information in support of their claims, so that decision-making could proceed.

 ‘Decision-making has been ongoing since that time.

 ‘Less than 15 people were found to be owed protection of the original East Timorese caseload of 1700.

 ‘Of the people not owed protection, 1560 had their refusal affirmed by the Refugee Review Tribunal and asked for  Ministerial intervention.

 ‘These cases were carefully examined by Senator Vanstone and her predecessor and it was decided that there were public  interest grounds for intervening in all but a very small number of cases. Only around 50 people have not been granted  visas. 

 ‘These people are now expected to return to East Timor and will have access to a reintegration package, which takes the  form of cash assistance and a waiver of any debt owed to the Government.’
