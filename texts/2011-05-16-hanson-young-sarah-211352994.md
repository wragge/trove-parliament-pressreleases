 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 Greens condemn ‘Asia Pacific solution’ for  asylum seekers   

 

 The Australian Greens have condemned moves by the Federal government to possibly include  Thailand in its regional plans for asylum seekers seeking our protection, because neither Thailand nor  Malaysia are signatories to the Refugee Convention.   

 Thailand’s foreign minister last weekend said his country was interested in further talks with Australia on  the basis of a ‘five-for-one’ swap of asylum seekers for confirmed refugees, as has been agreed but not  finalised with Malaysia.   

 “Julia Gillard is sounding more and more like John Howard every day,” Greens immigration spokesperson,  Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Beating up on refugees in desperation for a quick political fix for a government which that has lost the  spine for compassion and to do what is right.”    

 The government is bulldozing ahead with its ‘Asia Pacific solution’ despite no agreement being signed and  without anyone knowing what the terms of any agreement will be and the conditions people will face.    

 “Australia has an obligation to ensure any vulnerable person is not sent to a country where they may face  further harm or ill-treatment,” Sen. Hanson-Young said.   

 “We have an obligation and moral responsibility to ensure that asylum seekers, particularly children, are  protected.    

 “Neither Malaysia nor Thailand are signatories to the Refugee Convention and both have appalling records  for treating asylum seekers. Based on their records, no refugee we send to either country is guaranteed to  be given protection or safety.    

 “It is totally unacceptable for a nation as wealthy and well resourced as Australia to wipe our hands of our  obligations and expectations to treat people properly and with compassion.   

 “Trading away our moral and international obligations to our poorer neighbours smacks of an arrogant  government which has forgotten what makes Australia the country of a fair go.”
