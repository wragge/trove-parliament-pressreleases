  ASSISTANCE FOR BURl\tiESE REFUGEES 

  14 February 1997 

  I deplore the attacks on refugee camps on the Thai-Burma border which destroyed the  homes and belongings of an estimated 10 000 ethnic Karen refugees. The attacks were  carried out by forces associated with Burma's State Law and Order Council and I call  on the Burmese government to use its influence to ensure that there are no further  attacks of this type on the border camps. 

  In these circumstances of increased hardship for refugees already living in difficult  conditions I am pleased to announce that Australia will provide a further $800 000 in  humanitarian relief to Burmese refugees who are situated in camps along the  Burma/Thai border. 

  The aid is for over 100 000 refugees composed of largely the Karen ethnic minority but  also the Man and Karenni peoples. These peoples have been made refugees as a result  of the continued military activity in ethnic minority "states" of Burma. 

  The money will provide food, mosquito nets, firewood, blankets, and basic health care.  The assistance is designed to promote self-sufficiency and assist the refugees in  establishing their own health system. 

  $600 000 is going to the National Council of Churches in Australia (NCCA) as part of  their work with the Burmese Border Consortium (BBC) who currently provide all the  food and relief assistance to the refugees. As well as providing a survival level of food  and relief items, their program aims to help preserve the cultural identity of the 

  refugees through its emphasis on self-sufficiency . 

  ,. 

  A further $200 000 has been allocated to Medicins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without  Borders) to provide medical assistance to reduce the spread of communicable diseases  and improve sanitation . These activities include malaria control, immunisations, and the  development of adequate sanitation facilities to reduce the prevalence of disease in the  camps.
