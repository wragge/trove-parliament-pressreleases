 HOWARD TAKES THE FIRST STEP TOWARD A NEW TPV POLICY APPROACH   

 I welcome the Prime Minister’s decision to allow Mr Riad Saleem, an Iraqi refugee in  Australia on a Temporary Protection Visa (TPV), to re-enter Australia upon his return  from Iraq for his father’s funeral.   

 This is unprecedented for a TPV holder.   

 Until today the Government’s policy was a prohibition on any right of return for a TPV  holder who left Australia for whatever purpose or reason.   

 I call on the Government to indicate that this is not a one-off, but a shift in policy from a  blanket ban to a case by case exercise of Ministerial discretion.   

 The right of return to Australia for a TPV holder should be precisely as has been  delineated by John Howard in this case.     

 Labor introduced amendments in the Senate to the Migration Amendment Bill (No.1) to  this effect in March earlier this year.   

 The ability of a TPV holder to re-enter Australia should not be an automatic right but a  decision that should be made on a case by case basis on the basis of Ministerial  discretion. 

 

 In light of the attention drawn to TPV holders because of the Prime Minister’s decision in  this case, I again call on the Government to adopt Labor’s one-off two year TPV policy  approach.    

 The Howard Government continues to preside over an enormous backlog of TPV holders  applying for further protection.     

 There are currently 8,000 to 9,000 TPV holders in the Australian community.  Nearly  4,000 of them have lived in the Australian community for over 3 years.  They came as  unauthorised arrivals on John Howard’s watch.  He said they were refugees, and said they  could live in the Australian community. 

 

 Under John Howard’s TPV system, these people have no certainty in their lives and  could potentially live in the Australian community on a temporary basis for the rest of  their lives. Labor’s policy of a two year one-off TPV will end that uncertainty.
