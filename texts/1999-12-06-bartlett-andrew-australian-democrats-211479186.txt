  East Timor 
refugees pressured to leave   
Government’s misleading claims that departures are voluntary

  The Government is returning 
unwil  ling East Timorese refugees before it is safe for 
them to return home, according to the Australian Democrats.

  Early this morning more than one hundred remaining 
East Timorese refugees who have been housed at the Leeuwin Barracks 
in WA refused to leave. Hundreds of refugees left Perth on a charter 
flight back to East Timor last night. 

  Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Democrats’ immigration 
spokesperson ,has pursued the Government in question time and in estimates 
hearings last week, on the question of what would happen to East Timorese 
refugees in Australia unwilling to leave Australia by this week.

  The Government has consistently said that East Timor 
refugees would only be returned voluntarily.

  "Clearly some of the East Timor refugees are 
being returned against their will. This is not only inhumane, it makes 
a lie of the immigration minister’s claims they would only be returned 
voluntarily.

  "While the UNHCR has said it is ‘safe’ for 
refugees to return to East Timor, water and food supplies, shelter and 
access to medical and education services are still clearly inadequate 
and we are approaching the monsoon season," he said.

  The Minister for Immigration, Phillip Ruddock, has 
said that the East Timorese refugees in Australia will only be returned 
voluntarily.

  "The Democrats oppose temporary visas for any 
refugees. Temporary visas are a bastardisation of the refugee humanitarian 
program’s aims, extend refugees’ uncertainty and stress, and policy-wise 
are just a throw to One Nation," said Senator Bartlett.

  The Democrats have also questioned the adequacy of 
the UNHCR emergency shelter and assistance packages which refugees will 
receive which consist of a bag of rice, a blanket and a plastic sheet. 

  "Some of these people have nothing. What are 
they even meant to cook the rice in?"
