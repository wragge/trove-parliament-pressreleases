 BANKING WITH THE POOR

 "It is a misconception that the world's poor are a bad credit risk" Gordon Bilney  said today. The Minister for Development Cooperation was in Brisbane opening  the Third Asia-Pacific Regional Workshop on Banking with the Poor.

 "The work of the Foundation for Development Cooperation has shown that micro­ credit, with all its opportunity for self-help, can be provided on fully commercial  terms."

 "Micro-enterprise development is an important and growing element in Australia’s  own aid program. New activities will be piloted in the South Pacific, Thailand and  Laos over the next two years. They will joint activities already under way in the  Philippines, Vietnam and Cambodia. Micro-credit is a major component in many  o f these micro-development activities."

 Mr Bilney also said that micro-enterprise had to be kept in perspective.

 "While I certainly believe that micro-enterprises have enormous potential to  promote economic and social development, I also recognise that we cannot become  too focussed on small-scale project activities and ignore the broader environment in  which the small enterprises must operate. Micro-enterprises require fertile soil if  they are to flourish. Investment in infrastructure, such as rural feeder roads and  public market places, is important.

 Mr Bilney praised the Workshop's convenor, the Foundation for Development  Cooperation, for its ground-breaking work in the micro-credit field. "The  Foundation has provided a lead that aid-donating countries are now following. I  am sure that governments stand to leam a lot during this week."

 CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY

 BANKING WITH THE POOR 

 THIRD ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL WORKSHOP 

 BRISBANE 21-25 NOVEMBER 1994

 FORMAL OPENING AND KEYNOTE ADDRESS 

 BY THE HON GORDON BILNEY MP  MINISTER FOR DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION  AND PACIFIC ISLAND AFFAIRS

 INTRODUCTION 

 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN

 I HAVE THE HONOUR THIS MORNING TO OPEN THE THIRD ASIA-PACIFIC 

 REGIONAL WORKSHOP ON BANKING WITH THE POOR.

 FIRSTLY, I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A WARM WELCOME TO THE MANY 

 OVERSEAS VISITORS AND TRUST YOUR STAY HERE WILL BE BOTH A 

 PRODUCTIVE AND ENJOYABLE ONE. I AM SURE ALL OF US WILL BENEFIT 

 GREATLY FROM THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MIX WITH FELLOW RESEARCHERS 

 AND PRACTITIONERS IN THE FIELD OF MICRO-CREDIT. DURING THIS WEEK 

 OF SHARING AND EXCHANGING IDEAS, I HOPE THAT WE CAN ADD TO THE  INNOVATIVE METHODS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED TO 

 ASSIST THE POOR» BOTH IN OUR REGION AND AROUND THE WORLD.

 I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE THE FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPMENT  COOPERATION FOR ITS CAMPAIGN OF ADVOCACY FOR BANKING WITH THE 

 POOR. THIS WORK HAS SHOWN THAT WHILE THE POOR ARE DEFINITELY  CREDIT WORTHY, THEY FACE MANY OBSTACLES IN GAINING ACCESS TO 

 THE MOST BASIC OF CREDIT AND ASSOCIATED BANKING SERVICES.

 THE TWO PREVIOUS REGIONAL WORKSHOPS ON BANKING WITH THE 

 POOR, THE FIRST IN MANILA IN 1991 AND THE SECOND IN KUALA LUMPUR 

 IN 1992, WERE UNIQUE FORUMS IN BRINGING TOGETHER THE 

 COMMERCIAL BANKS AND NCOS TO EXPLORE AVENUES TO MAKE CREDIT 

 AVAILABLE TO THE POOREST OF THE POOR AND PROVIDE THEM WITH A 

 REAL OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THEMSELVES. IMPORTANTLY, BANKING  WITH THE POOR HAS SHOWN THAT THIS ASSISTANCE CAN BE PROVIDED 

 ON FULLY COMMERCIAL TERMS.

 THE FOUNDATION HAS DEMONSTRATED THE IMPORTANCE OF 

 ESTABLISHING SOUND COMMERCIAL LINKAGES BETWEEN THE FORMAL 

 FINANCIAL SECTOR AND THE NCOS AND COMMUNITY GROUPS. THESE 

 LINKAGES ARE ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL IF THE POOREST OF THE POOR ARE 

 TO HAVE ACCESS TO FUNDS FROM COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL  INSTITUTIONS.

 I COMMEND THE FOUNDATION IN PURSUING THIS PATH-BREAKING WORK 

 AND IN ENCOURAGING THE COMMERCIAL BANKING SECTOR TO VIEW 

 NCOS AND SELF-HELP GROUPS AS SOUND INVESTMENTS. THE 

 FOUNDATION'S ONGOING ROLE IN ORGANISING NATIONAL WORKSHOPS 

 ON BANKING WITH THE POOR IN SEVEN ASIAN COUNTRIES HAS HELPED TO 

 SUSTAIN A PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN BANKS AND NCOS. I AM  PARTICULARLY PLEASED TO WELCOME THE REPRESENTATIVES HERE 

 TODAY FROM THE COMMERCIAL BANKING SECTOR.

 MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT ON THE INTERNATIONAL AGENDA

 I BELIEVE THERE IS AN INCREASING INTEREST INTERNATIONALLY IN THE 

 STRATEGIES USED TO DEVELOP SMALL ENTERPRISES. FLOURISHING 

 INFORMAL BUSINESSES HAVE LONG EXISTED IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,  PROVIDING EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. JOB 

 CREATION IS ONE OF THE MAIN CHALLENGES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 

 AND IT IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNISED THAT THE MAJORITY OF THESE 

 JOBS WILL NEED TO COME FROM THE INFORMAL SECTOR. MICRO­

 ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT IS NOW FIRMLY PLACED ON THE 

 INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENDA.

 FOR EXAMPLE, THE WORLD BANK HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES 

 AIMED AT PROMOTING MICRO-CREDIT. THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 

 IS ALSO INCREASINGLY DIRECTING FUNDS SPECIFICALLY TO MICRO­

 CREDIT INITIATIVES. RECENTLY IT APPROVED US$23 MILLION FOR A 

 MICRO-CREDIT PROJECT IN INDONESIA. ALSO, IN THE LEAD UP TO THE 

 WORLD SUMMIT FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, MICRO-ENTERPRISE 

 DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD AS AN EFFECTIVE 

 MEANS OF ALLEVIATING POVERTY AND CREATING EMPLOYMENT THESE 

 ARE TWO OF THE KEY THEMES OF THE SUMMIT.

 MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT AND POVERTY REDUCTION

 ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS INCREASED INTEREST IS, I BELIEVE, THE 

 IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT, 

 INCLUDING MICRO-CREDIT SCHEMES, CAN MAKE TOWARDS THE PRIMARY  GOAL OF DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS THE ELIMINATION OF POVERTY. WITH 

 OVER 1.3 BILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN ABSOLUTE POVERTY, ACCESS TO 

 CREDIT AND ASSOCIATED SERVICES REPRESENTS A REAL OPPORTUNITY 

 FOR PEOPLE TO HELP THEMSELVES TO ACHIEVE LASTING IMPROVEMENTS 

 TO THEIR LIVING STANDARDS.

 LET ME SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS 

 APPROACH TO POVERTY REDUCTION, AND THE ROLE OF MICRO­

 ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT. /

 THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGE OF TACKLING POVERTY WAS BROUGHT  HOME TO ME DURING MY RECENT TRIP TO RWANDA WHERE I CAME FACE  TO FACE WITH THE REALITY OF PEOPLES' DAILY STRUGGLE FOR PHYSICAL  SURVIVAL. THIS EXPERIENCE WAS IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE REALITY 

 HERE IN AUSTRALIA, WHERE MOST OF US LIVE IN A COMFORTABLE AND 

 SECURE ENVIRONMENT.

 AUSTRALIA RECOGNISES THAT THE CHALLENGE OF REDUCING POVERTY  IN THE LONG-TERM REQUIRES A COMBINATION OF MEASURES AIMED AT  SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS BOTH SUSTAINABLE

 3 3 9 7

 AND EQUITABLE. ECONOMIC GROWTH IS AN ESSENTIAL ENABLING FORCE 

 FOR DEVELOPMENT, EXPANDING THE RANGE OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO 

 BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND NATIONS. GROWTH IS NEEDED TO GENERATE 

 THE RESOURCES WHICH ALLOW PEOPLE TO ENJOY A REASONABLE  STANDARD OF LIVING.

 HOWEVER, ECONOMIC GROWTH OF ITSELF DOES NOT NECESSARILY LEAD 

 TO IMPROVEMENTS IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. MEASURES TO PROMOTE 

 ECONOMIC GROWTH MUST BE COMPLEMENTED BY INVESTMENTS IN 

 HUMAN RESOURCES THROUGH EDUCATION, HEALTH AND CAPACITY 

 BUILDING. SUCH INVESTMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR EQUITY.

 MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF 

 EFFORTS TO PROMOTE BROAD BASED GROWTH. IT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO 

 ECONOMIC GROWTH BY TAPPING A VAST AND UNDER-UTILISED POOL OF 

 PRODUCTIVE SKILLS AND RESOURCES, WHILE ALSO INCREASING THE 

 INCOMES OF THE POOR DIRECTLY. THROUGH EARNING EXTRA INCOME, 

 THE POOR CAN AFFORD BETTER NUTRITION AND HOUSING, HEALTH CARE 

 AND EDUCATION FOR THEIR CHILDREN.

 MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT CAN BE PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN 

 INCREASING WOMEN'S STATUS AND INCOME. BY PROVIDING WOMEN 

 WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN INCOME-GENERATING 

 ACTIVITIES, THEY ARE ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR EDUCATION, HEALTH,  LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIONS WITH CONSEQUENT WIDER BENEFITS 

 FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. WOMEN HAVE 

 PROVEN ENTREPRENEURIAL TALENTS AND "BANKABILITY”, WHICH HAVE  BEEN KEY FACTORS IN THE SUCCESS OF MANY MICRO-CREDIT SCHEMES.

 WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION, AND THE PARTICIPATION OF COMMUNITIES IN 

 GENERAL, IS ABSOLUTELY BASIC TO THE SUCCESS OF MICRO-ENTERPRISE  PROGRAMS. COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN THE DESIGN AND 

 IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECTS IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE SUSTAINABILITY 

 OF THEIR ACTIVITIES. IN A BROADER SENSE, SUCH PARTICIPATION IS  ALSO ESSENTIAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STRONG CIVIL SOCIETY,

 WHERE PEOPLE HAVE THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC POWER TO HAVE A SAY  IN THE FUTURE OF THEIR COUNTRY.

 MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT AND AUSTRALIA'S AID PROGRAM

 TO REINFORCE THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF MICRO-ENTERPRISE 

 DEVELOPMENT IN AUSTRALIA'S AID PROGRAM, I WAS PLEASED TO 

 ANNOUNCE AN INCREASED COMMITMENT TO MICRO-ENTERPRISE 

 PROJECTS IN THE 1994/95 BUDGET. THIS NEW INITIATIVE, VALUED AT $1.3 

 MILLION OVER TWO YEARS, WIL PILOT NEW ACTIVITIES IN THE SOUTH 

 PACIFIC AND SOUTH EAST ASIA DURING 1994/95 AND 1995/967

 WORK HAS BEGUN ON PROJECTS TO BE FINANCED UNDER THE NEW  INITIATIVE. IN THAILAND, A MICRO-ENTERPRISE PROJECT HAS 

 COMMENCED INVOLVING A BANGKOK NGO AND THE AUSTRALIAN BASED 

 OPPORTUNITY FOUNDATION (PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS THE MARANATHA 

 TRUST). THE PROJECT WILL ASSIST IN THE ESTABLISHMENT AND 

 TRAINING OF AN INDIGENOUS SPECIALIST NGO TO DELIVER CREDIT,  TRAINING AND OTHER SERVICES TO THE POOR LIVING IN SLUM AREAS OF 

 BANGKOK.

 THE GOVERNMENT OF LAOS HAS ALSO INDICATED INTEREST IN MICRO­

 ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. POSSIBLE PROJECTS ARE NOW 

 BEING DISCUSSED WITH THE LOCAL PLANNING AGENCY AND NCOS.

 CONSULTATIONS ARE ALSO UNDERWAY WITH SOUTH PACIFIC CREDIT 

 UNIONS AND THE AUSTRALIAN EXECUTIVE SERVICE OVERSEAS PROGRAM  TO IMPLEMENT THE SOUTH PACIFIC COMPONENT OF THE MICRO­ ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE. THIS COMPONENT WILL PROVIDE  TRAINING FOR SMALL-SCALE ENTREPRENEURS IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC 

 REGION TO ASSIST THEM TO ACCESS FINANCIAL SERVICES AND CREDIT.  TO EXPAND THE RANGE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THE  REGION, ASSISTANCE WILL ALSO BE PROVIDED TO THE CREDIT UNION 

 MOVEMENT IN THE FORM OF RESEARCH AND PRACTICAL TRAINING 

 ATTACHMENTS.

 ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE EXPERIENCE IN SMALL ENTERPRISE 

 DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN IN ASIA, SPECIAL CONSIDERATION NEEDS TO BE 

 GIVEN TO THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA AND 

 THE ISLAND COUNTRIES OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC. DEVELOPMENT OF A 

 VIBRANT PRIVATE SECTOR - INCLUDING SMALL ENTERPRISES - WILL BE 

 CRUCIAL TO THE ABILITY OF PNG AND THE PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES 

 TO GENERATE SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH.

 HOWEVER, STIMULATING MICRO-ENTERPRISE ACTIVITY IN THE PACIFIC 

 PRESENTS SOME INTERESTING CHALLENGES. IN MOST CASES THESE 

 COUNTRIES DO NOT HAVE THE STRONG INTERNAL MARKETS, HUMAN AND 

 PHYSICAL RESOURCES, AND ENTREPRENEURIAL TRADITION WHICH HAVE 

 HELPED TO FUEL THE VIBRANT INFORMAL SECTOR THAT IS FOUND IN 

 ASIA AND ELSEWHERE. THE PACIFIC MAY NEED THE DEVELOPMENT OF 

 UNIQUE APPROACHES IF THE POTENTIAL OF MICRO-ENTERPRISE IS TO BE 

 REALISED. I AM PLEASED TO SEE THESE ISSUES WILL BE EXPLORED IN 

 WORKSHOPS THIS WEEK AND I PARTICULARLY LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR 

 FINDINGS IN THIS AREA.

 I SHOULD ADD THAT THE $1.3 MILLION TWO-YEAR MICRO-ENTERPRISE 

 DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE IS ONLY A SMALL COMPONENT OF THE TOTAL  MICRO-ENTERPRISE ACTIVITY IN THE AUSTRALIAN AID PROGRAM. 

 AUSTRALIA HAS FUNDED MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN  A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES OVER A PERIOD OF MANY YEARS. IN FACT, 

 OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS AUSTRALIA WILL CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN 

 $14 MILLION TO MICRO-ENTERPRISE ACTTVITIES.

 ONE OF THE LARGEST PROGRAMS THAT HAS FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING 

 MICRO-ENTERPRISES IS THE PHILIPPINES / AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY 

 ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, OR PACAP. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES 

 ASSISTANCE FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA TO NCOS IN THE 

 PHILIPPINES. THE GRANT ASSISTANCE IS FOR COMMUNITY-BASED 

 DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AIMED AT RAISING THE LIVING STANDARDS OF 

 THE POOR AND THE MARGINALISED.

 SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 1986, PACAP HAS GROWN IN SIZE, IMPACT AND 

 ORGANISATIONAL CAPACITY. TO DATE, PACAP HAS FUNDED 381 

 PROJECTS FOR A TOTAL VALUE OF JUST UNDER $12 MILLION. CURRENTLY 

 THERE ARE 115 ONGOING PROJECTS. AROUND HALF OF THESE INVOLVE 

 SMALL SCALE LOAN ACTIVITIES. A RECENT REVIEW OF PACAP FOUND 

 THAT IT HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN IMPROVING THE INCOME 

 EARNING CAPACITY AND LIVING STANDARDS OF THE POOR.

 IN ADDITION TO PACAP, THE PHILIPPINES AUSTRALIA NGO PROGRAM, OR 

 PANGOP, PROVIDES GRANTS FOR SELECTED PROJECTS INITIATED BY  AUSTRALIAN NCOS WITH PHILIPPINE NGO PARTNERS. IN THE FIRST TWO 

 YEARS OF PANGOP'S OPERATION, FUNDING OF $2.6 MILLION HAS BEEN 

 APPROVED FOR SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. I HAVE 

 RECENTLY APPROVED THREE NEW PANGOP PROJECTS, EACH OF WHICH  HAS A COMMUNITY CREDIT AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT FOCUS.

 IN VIETNAM, AUSTRALIA IS SUPPORTING THROUGH UNICEF THE 

 DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL SCALE ENTERPRISES FOR RURAL WOMEN. THIS  PROJECT INVOLVES TRAINING IN MICRO-ENTERPRISE MANAGEMENT AND 

 THE OPERATION OF CREDIT FACILITIES. ANOTHER GRANT WILL SUPPORT 

 THE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT AGENCY, AN AUSTRALIAN  NGO, IN IMPLEMENTING THE VIETNAM WOMEN'S UNION FOOD 

 PRODUCTION PROGRAM. THIS PROJECT INVOLVES THE MANUFACTURE OF 

 HERBAL MEDICINES AND IMPROVEMENT IN CROP PRODUCTION THROUGH 

 TRAINING AND CREDIT FACILITIES

 IN CAMBODIA, AUSTRALIA IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE CAMBODIA  RESETTLEMENT AND REINTEGRATION PROGRAM, IMPLEMENTED BY THE 

 UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME. THE PROGRAM WILL 

 SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF HANDICRAFT ENTERPRISES AND ASSIST  IN MARKETING. THE PROJECT IS ALSO SEEKING TO REVITALISE THE 

 LOCAL SILK INDUSTRY. THE OVERALL AIM OF THIS PROJECT IS TO  PROVIDE INCOME-EARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITIES WHO 

 HAVE RECENTLY ABSORBED, FOLLOWING YEARS OF WAR, RETURNING  CAMBODIAN REFUGEES AND INTERNALLY DISPLACED CAMBODIANS.

 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AUSTRALIAN NCOS WHICH ARE SUCCESSFULLY 

 DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING MICRO-CREDIT AND MICRO-ENTERPRISE 

 ACTIVITIES. A NUMBER OF THEM HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED GOOD 

 INTERNATIONAL REPUTATIONS. I BELIEVE THERE IS SCOPE FOR 

 AUSTRALIAN NCOS TO BECOME MORE INVOLVED IN THIS AREA.

 WE ARE ALSO FORTUNATE TO HAVE A NUMBER OF AUSTRALIAN 

 RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS WHICH ARE ASSISTING THE EXPANSION OF 

 MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT.

 THE IMPORTANT WORK OF AUSTRALIAN ACADEMICS SUCH AS: DR JOE 

 REMENYI, INCLUDING HIS BOOK "WHERE CREDIT IS DUE"; THE ENTERPRISE 

 DEVELOPMENT COURSES OFFERED BY THE SOUTHERN CROSS UNIVERSITY 

 UNDER PROFESSOR PHILIP NECK; THE RESEARCH AND APPRAISAL WORK 

 BY THE NATIONAL CENTRE FOR DEVELOPMENT STUDIES AT THE ANU - 

 AND SPECIFICALLY ALEX AGAFONOFF - TO MENTION ONLY A FEW - 

 PROVIDE A SOLID BASE FOR THIS EXPANSION.

 FOR ITS PART, AIDAB, THE AUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT 

 ASSISTANCE BUREAU, IS EXPLORING AVENUES THAT ENCOURAGE THE 

 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND SHARING OF EXPERIENCES BETWEEN 

 MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS. AIDAB IS ALSO 

 CONDUCTING A NUMBER OF IN-HOUSE SEMINARS AND TRAINING COURSES  TO ENSURE THAT OFFICERS ARE KEPT UP-TO-DATE WITH CURRENT IDEAS 

 AND OPTIONS ON MICRO-CREDIT AND MICRO-ENTERPRISE ACTIVITIES.

 FUTURE CHALLENGES

 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THAT LIE AHEAD FOR DONORS 

 AND PRACTITIONERS ALIKE IN DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING MICRO­ ENTERPRISE ACTIVITIES. WHILE I CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT MICRO­

 ENTERPRISES HAVE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC AND 

 SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, I ALSO RECOGNISE THAT WE CANNOT BECOME  TOO FOCUSED ON SMALL-SCALE PROJECT ACTIVITIES AND IGNORE THE 

 BROADER ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE SMALL ENTERPRISES MUST 

 OPERATE.

 MICRO-ENTERPRISES REQUIRE FERTILE SOIL IF THEY ARE TO FLOURISH. 

 INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE, SUCH AS RURAL FEEDER ROADS AND 

 PUBLIC MARKET PLACES, IS IMPORTANT. ASSISTANCE WHICH ENABLES 

 EXISTING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO EXTEND THEIR REACH TO 

 INCLUDE SUPPORT TO MICRO-ENTERPRISES IS ALSO A VERY PRODUCTIVE 

 AVENUE TO EXPLORE. OF COURSE, CONCENTRATION ON INDIRECT  SUPPORT NEED NOT PRECLUDE DIRECT SUPPORT - THERE IS SCOPE FOR  BOTH.

 WHILE THE SECTOR IS IMPORTANT, AND HOLDS GREAT POTENTIAL, IT IS 

 NOT THE PANACEA FOR ALL DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS IT IS ONLY ONE OF . 

 MANY DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES. MORE PARTICULARLY, WE NEED TO BE 

 REALISTIC IN ASSESSING JUST WHAT ROLE EXTERNAL AID CAN PLAY IN 

 ASSISTING THE SECTOR. DONORS NEED TO BE CAREFUL THAT IN THEIR  ENTHUSIASM FOR MICRO-CREDIT THEY DO NOT PROVIDE ASSISTANCE IN 

 A WAY WHICH UNDERMINES THE LONG-TERM VIABILITY OF THESE  ACTIVITIES.

 I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE WORK THAT THE FOUNDATION HAS PUT INTO 

 THE "BEST PRACTICE" DOCUMENT CIRCULATED FOR THIS MEETING. THIS 

 IS TO BE THE BASIS OF THE DISCUSSIONS IN THE COMING WEEK. I LOOK 

 FORWARD TO THE RESULTS OF THESE DISCUSSIONS AS THEY WILL  PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT INPUT INTO AUSTRALIA'S WORK.

 IN PARTICULAR THESE PRINCIPLES FOCUS ON CRITICAL ISSUES SUCH AS:

 â¢ THE IMPORTANCE OF SAVINGS AS A DEMONSTRATION OF FINANCIAL  DISCIPLINE IN SEEKING TO ATTRACT LOAN FUNDS FROM THE FORMAL 

 FINANCIAL SECTOR,

 â¢ THE IMPORTANCE OF CHARGING MARKET INTEREST RATES TO ENSURE 

 SUSTAINABILITY OF PROJECTS, AND

 3 4 0 3

 â¢ THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF NCOS IN PROVIDING INSTITUTIONAL 

 SUPPORT AND ADVICE TO SELF-HELP GROUPS.

 WHILE EARLIER DONOR EXPERIENCE WITH CREDIT PROGRAMS HAS BEEN 

 THORNY, TECHNIQUES FOR PROVIDING CREDIT TO THE POOR HAVE 

 IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST DECADE. THE BANKING WITH 

 THE POOR PROGRAM HAS CONSISTENTLY ARGUED THAT LACK OF ACCESS 

 TO CREDIT, PROVIDED IN A TIMELY FASHION AND AT COMMERCIAL RATES 

 OF INTEREST, IS A CRUCIAL CONSTRAINT UPON THE CAPACITY OF THE 

 WORKING POOR TO HELP THEMSELVES THROUGH INFORMAL SECTOR 

 INCOME-GENERATING ACTIVITIES. IN PARTICULAR, BANKING WITH THE 

 POOR GIVES EMPHASIS TO DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT BY  MEANS OF LINKAGES BETWEEN SELF HELP GROUPS OF THE POOR AND 

 COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WITH NCOS PERFORMING A 

 RANGE OF INTERMEDIARY FUNCTIONS.

 THE FOUNDATION'S REPORT "TRANSACTION COSTS OF LENDING TO THE 

 RURAL POOR", PUBLISHED FOR THIS WORKSHOP, IS ANOTHER VALUABLE 

 ADDITION TO THE RESEARCH ON MICRO-CREDIT.

 NEVERTHELESS, THE QUESTION OF WHETHER CREDIT IS THE MAJOR 

 LIMITING CONSTRAINT ON THE ABILITY OF THE POOR TO ENGAGE IN 

 INCOME GENERATING ENTERPRISES IS FAR FROM SETTLED. THIS IS WHY 

 THE AUSTRALIAN AID PROGRAM PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR A BROAD 

 RANGE OF ACTIVITIES WHICH INVOLVE CREDIT AS WELL AS MICRO­

 ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT. SUCH ACTIVITIES INVOLVE TRAINING IN 

 BASIC BUSINESS AND MARKETING SKILLS, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 

 PROGRAMS AND INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING OF LOCAL 

 ORGANISATIONS. OBVIOUSLY, MICRO-CREDIT IS A MAJOR COMPONENT IN 

 MANY OF THESE MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.

 CLEARLY THERE IS NO ONE CORRECT MODEL FOR PROVIDING ASSISTANCE 

 TO THE SECTOR. HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE STRONG AND COMMON PRE­ REQUISITE - THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS MUST BE ADAPTED 

 TO THE LOCAL SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC REALITIES OF THE

 3 4 0 4

 COUNTRY, AND BE BASED ON LOCAL NEEDS EXPRESSED BY THE PEOPLE  THEMSELVES.

 CLOSING

 FINALLY I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON WHY I AM SO POSITIVE 

 REGARDING THE POTENTIAL OF THIS WORKSHOP SERIES. THE 

 FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION HAS RECOGNISED THAT 

 THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL POOL OF KNOWLEDGE ON MICRO-CREDIT 

 ACTIVITIES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND IN FACT, WE DONORS HAVE  ARRIVED VERY LATE ON THE SCENE. IN BRINGING TOGETHER THIS BODY 

 OF PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE, I AM SURE DONORS STAND TO LEARN A LOT 

 OVER THE REMAINDER OF THIS WEEK. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS KIND OF 

 DIALOGUE CANNOT BE UNDERESTIMATED.

 I HOPE I HAVE LEFT YOU IN NO DOUBT THAT AUSTRALIA IS COMMITTED  TO SUPPORTING MICRO-CREDIT AND MICRO-ENTERPRISES THROUGH THE 

 DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION PROGRAM. THE OUTCOMES OF THIS 

 CONFERENCE WILL HELP ALL DONORS TO IMPROVE THEIR EFFORTS IN 

 THIS AREA.

 I AM PLEASED TO OFFICIALLY OPEN THE FOUNDATION FOR 

 DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION'S THIRD ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL 

 WORKSHOP ON BANKING WITH THE POOR AND WISH YOU ALL THE BEST  WITH YOUR ENDEAVOURS IN THIS IMPORTANT AREA OF DEVELOPMENT.
