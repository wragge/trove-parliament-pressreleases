 LAURIE FERGUSON MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION   

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP   PARLIAMENT HOUSE CANBERRA  -   26 MAY 2005   

 ISSUE: Labor policy, Royal Commission   

 LAURIE FERGUSON: I think it is necessary to clarify from the start, there has been a  bit  of  speculation  in  newspapers  and  coverage  that  because  Labor  is  not  going  to   allow a conscience vote on these matters, that somehow means we are against the  proposals  put  up  by  Petro  Georgiou.  In  contrast,  I  think  large  parts  of  it  are  in   accordance  with  Labor  policy,  we  will  be  discussing  this  with  Petro  in  the  weeks   ahead.  At  this  stage  as  I  say,  large  parts  of  this,  stateless  people,  temporary   protection  visa  people,  children,  these  are  very  close  to  where  we  have  been   historically. We are very positive, in a broad sense, at this suggestion.   

 JOURNALIST:  Bruce  Beard  says  your  performance  on  this  has  been  appalling,  that   Laurie Ferguson is a right of Genghis Khan on this issue?   

 LAURIE  FERGUSON:  Oh  well  look  I  am  an  active  member  of  Amnesty  International   with Bruce, we are close friends; I don’t think that is his serious point of view.   

 JOURNALIST: So are you talking about some sort of alliance with Petro Georgiou?   

 LAURIE  FERGUSON:  I  don’t  think  John  Howard  should  run  around  saying  Petro  has   adopted Labor Party policy totally or anything like that.  There are large parts of it that  are very similar to our position. That’s where we stand.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you still want a judicial inquiry into the Rau matter?   

 LAURIE FERGUSON: Well I would have thought that’s manifestly necessary. We have  Mr  Palmer  saying;  essentially  he  will  have  to  make  suggestions  on  the  next  200   cases. Despite assurances from Mr Anderson that he would be away for a short time  and that these matters will be handled, it is clear that he can not handle these 200  cases.  There  are  great  suspicions  about  the  way  the  Department  is  handling  these   matters  and  the  Minister’s  defence  of  her  Department  and  there  are  also  figures   tossed around that there are another 928 cases that they haven’t decided yet, were  lawful  or  unlawful.  So  this  is  an  avalanche  of  cases.  I  hope  that  Palmer’s  implied   comments,  that  there  had  to  be  more  transparency  in  the  system,  or  make   fundamental suggestions that are worth while but until there is a Royal Commission  where  people  can  be  forced  to  self  incriminate  from  the  Department,  where   witnesses  can  be  forced  to  attend,  and  where  people  are  protected  from  litigation   over slander then its not going to go anywhere, quite frankly.   

 JOURNALIST: And Bill Farmer and DIMIA officials, what of them?   

 LAURIE  FERGUSON:  Well  he  has  apologised  but  as  I  say,  manifestly  hopeless   performance, horrible treatment of a number  of  people,  who  knows  whether  in  this   900 and the other 200 aren’t of a similar dimension.   

 JOUNALIST: Is that the fault of the Immigration Minister?   

 LAURIE  FERGUSON:  The  current  Minister  was  not  the  Minister  at  the  time,  but  she   has essentially decided to bat it out, protect the previous incumbent and stand by the  Department  so  she  has  known  about  aspects  of  this  for  some  time  it  is  clear  in  

 regards to Alvarez that there was a decision made to cover up when they did become  aware  that  they  deported  a  person  wrongly,  that  the  investigation  that  had  taken   place  be  kept  secret.  Farmer  and  Vanstone,  their  performance  is  disgraceful  and  I   think it is more than reasonable that the Minister be sacked.   

 END
