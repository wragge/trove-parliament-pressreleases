    Speech The Hon  Brendan O'Connor  Minister for Home Affairs    23 September 2009   Australian Financial Review Defence Conference 2009  May I begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land we meet on - and pay my respects to their elders, both past and present.  I acknowledge the contribution of the Premier of New South Wales Nathan Rees and other significant speakers and guests including John Lawler, CEO of the Australian Crime Commission.   Thank you also to the organisers of this conference for giving me the opportunity to outline the Australian Government’s approach and plans in relation to border control, and the strategies and effort behind our recent actions in border protection management. I will also outline some evidence and indicators of the stance and impact of our border control policies.   I will outline the strategic elements which underpin the Rudd Government’s approach to border control. Our approach is co-ordinated, sensible and effective and is serving the country well.  Five key threats or risks are the focus of the Government’s actions. They are the threat of terrorism, people smuggling, the smuggling of illicit goods, particularly drugs, bio-security risks, and illegal foreign fishing.

 Significant improvements to Australia’s border control strategy in the last year derive 

 from the Prime Minister’s December 2008 National Security Statement . The Prime 

 Minister said then that “the arrangements the government has inherited involve a 

 wide range of government agencies but lack unified control and direction, and a 

 single point of accountability” ( Hansard , December 4 2008, pages 12555-12556).  

 

 Following the Prime Minister’s Statement, border control and law enforcement 

 agencies were directed by the Government to improve national coordination and 

 cooperation and establish a cohesive forum to provide operational priority setting for 

 all agencies involved in the effort.  Significantly, energy security and the impacts of 

 climate change were also brought within the national security policy analysis 

 process. 

 

 For border control and law enforcement agencies, this Statement directed a new, 

 whole-of-government response to border control management - the first key element 

 in the Rudd Government’s approach.  

 

 The Australian Customs Service was renamed the Australian Customs and Border 

 Protection Service to reflect the improved arrangements and to lead the new 

 approach. 

 

 The Customs and Border Protection Command (within the Customs Service) was 

 given the responsibility to lead the whole-of-government effort to combat maritime 

 people smuggling. 

 

 The number of maritime arrivals to Australia is relatively small compared to other first 

 world nations.  Against this backdrop we know that the world refugee population is 

 increasing, and with it we are seeing people risking their lives to come to Australia by 

 boat, paying people smugglers to organise the means to bring them here.    

 

 The UNHCR 2008 Global Trends Report  shows that there were 42 million forcibly 

 displaced people worldwide at the end of 2008, which included 15.2 million refugees.  

 The report also shows that asylum claims increased worldwide by a staggering 28% 

 Page 3 of 9 

 in 2008. Europe remains the primary destination for asylum seekers with 333,000 

 claims for asylum registered in 2008.  France had the highest number of registrations 

 at 35,400 followed by the United Kingdom 30,500.  In comparison 4,750 people 

 sought asylum in Australia in the same period.   

 

 With Customs and Border Protection Command taking the lead, a single agency now 

 provides oversight for intelligence and investigation tasking; international 

 engagement to disrupt and prevent people smuggling, as well as maritime 

 surveillance and response activities. 

 

 Customs and Border Protection Command has created a central hub, including 

 officers from Customs and Border Protection Service, the Australian Federal Police, 

 Defence and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to collect, analyse and 

 report on maritime people smuggling intelligence. The analysis and reports produced 

 by this group support decision making, as well as supporting tactical efforts against 

 criminal syndicates and specific people smuggling ventures en route to Australia. 

 

 This central hub is also working closely with the AFP’s People Smuggling Strike 

 Team, which has been strengthened with additional resources by the Government’s 

 $10.7 million investment, providing it with more investigators and intelligence 

 officers. 

 

 Turning to the threat of terrorism, Australian border management has faced many 

 challenges since the catastrophic events of September 2001 in the United States.  

 We have seen repeated acts of terrorism affecting Australians, including Bali and 

 recently in Jakarta. Faced with these threats, border protection agencies have taken 

 on a more significant national security role in recent years, with a greater focus on 

 counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation.  They have been working increasingly in 

 partnership with the intelligence community in national security areas, which have 

 not traditionally overlapped.  These partnerships provide for more effective joint 

 intelligence operations and intelligence-led responses that assist us to pursue and 

 dismantle terrorist networks.

 A second  element underlying our strategic approach is to realistically appraise the 

 challenges we face and the limitations and constraints of our situation in the context 

 of our position in the world. What follows are strong and realistic responses both to 

 the threats that we face and to the perpetrators of terrorism, people smuggling and 

 organised crime.  

 

 As Sun Tzu wrote in The Art of War , “If you know both yourself and your enemy, you 

 can win a hundred battles without a single loss”.  

 

 As a Nation our prosperity is largely reliant on gains from international trade, and we 

 recognise the economic and social benefits of travel to and from Australia. So our 

 aim in border security is to control threats but not to close or clog our border access 

 points which would risk these benefits. 

 

 The scale and challenge of what our Customs and Border Protection Service is 

 dealing with here is enormous.  For example, between now and 2020 the total 

 number of passengers entering Australia is expected to rise from around 12 million 

 to 20 million per year, with similar numbers departing.  Cargo movements are also 

 expected to increase by almost double over the same period.  

 

 We need to balance our response to border security with the need to continue to 

 promote international trade and travel. To do this we will have to continue to work 

 closely with our international trading partners and with industry. 

 

 We recognise that the majority of travellers and goods that arrive present a low risk 

 and we are committed to a risk based approach.  This means that people and goods 

 assessed as high risk are paid more attention than those assessed as low risk.  This 

 allows border agencies to focus their resources and their efforts where they will have 

 the greatest returns. 

 

 This is the Australian situation.  Our borders and territorial waters are massive, our 

 resources finite and our lifestyle and freedoms are attractive. The characteristics of 

 Australia’s border, provides a challenging environment to border agencies when it 

 comes to stopping people smuggling.   

 Page 5 of 9 

 

 Australia’s size and diversity means border management encompasses activities in 

 extreme natural environments from the Northern tropics to the Southern Ocean.  

 There are limited windows of opportunity for intervention at the physical border to 

 prevent illegal movements. It’s clear also that people smugglers trying to reach the 

 border are adaptable and increasingly sophisticated.   

 

 Therefore, our border protection agencies work together across a number of 

 environments, and not just at the border or in our territorial waters.  The geographic 

 location of the work of these agencies is broadly the following: 

 â¢ Within Australia - to provide and enforce the legal and operational framework 

 that allows movement in and out of Australia; 

 â¢ At the border - to identify and prevent risks at the physical entry and exit 

 points in order to prevent people involved in criminal activity from entering 

 Australia, or leaving to a destination where they might escape apprehension; 

 â¢ In the maritime zone and territorial waters - to identify irregular arrivals or 

 crime through surveillance and prevent risks en route to, Australia; and 

 â¢ Overseas - to work in countries where people smuggling, illicit trade or 

 terrorism originates to identify and stop the risks from entering Australia and, 

 where possible, to secure detection and apprehension of those who are 

 potential perpetrators. 

 

 The Government has increased resources and strengthened the ability of the way 

 law enforcement and border protection agencies disrupt and prevent people 

 smuggling activities in source, transit and departure countries.  Last year’s Federal 

 Budget allocated an extra $654 million for these efforts.  As a result resources were 

 significantly increased for Customs and Border Protection Command presence in 

 Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Colombo.  The Australian Federal Police has also been 

 funded for more officers to support the Indonesian National Police and establish a 

 new liaison post in Sri Lanka.  

 

 Our strengthened offshore approach is working.  In the last 12 months there have 

 been 81 disruptions of people smuggling ventures in Indonesia, resulting in the 

 Page 6 of 9 

 detention of 1,237 foreign nationals by Indonesian authorities, and the arrest of 19 

 people smuggling organisers.  

 

 This offshore strategy has stopped a significant number of boats from departing for 

 Australia. This is the important work that is being undertaken by the Australian 

 Federal Police.  The Indonesian National Police Chief recently approved the 

 establishment of a taskforce funded by the Australian Government to combat people 

 smuggling within Indonesia.  The taskforce will comprise of 145 local officers trained 

 by the Australian Federal Police and located in 12 key areas, providing a central 

 point for AFP operations.  This will support the work that the AFP is undertaking in 

 relation to investigations and extradition requests, importantly taking the battle 

 offshore. 

 

 Last year’s Budget investment is also targeted to boost Australia’s surveillance and 

 interception capabilities to minimise the risk of people smugglers reaching the 

 mainland.  The measures include enhanced aerial surveillance- adding two aircraft to 

 the surveillance fleet and, enhanced maritime surveillance, making available a well-equipped patrol vessel capable of transporting large numbers of irregular migrants in 

 humane conditions with access to medical support.  

 

 Under Australian and international law, a vessel cannot be intercepted by Australia 

 for people smuggling before it reaches the contiguous zone.  Boats are usually 

 detected before they reach the contiguous zone and kept under surveillance until 

 they are interdicted and the passengers transported to Christmas Island for 

 processing.  

 

 Border Protection Command is out there 24 hours day making sure that boats do not 

 reach the mainland.  Over 4,000 vessels are tracked each day in and around 

 Australia and potential suspect vessels are identified.  

 

 A third  element of our approach is to understand what tactics will be employed and 

 put ourselves in the position of the opponent.  In other words, know your enemy. As 

 the Japanese swordfighter and philosopher Miyamoto Musashi wrote in his Book of 

 Five Rings , “You win battles by knowing the enemy's timing, and using a timing 

 Page 7 of 9 

 which the enemy does not expect”. Whether our opponents are terrorists, or 

 smugglers of people or goods, or money launderers, or fishery thieves, the same 

 principle applies. The immediate implications for border protection are far reaching.  

 

 For example, think about the impact of border control itself on the activity we are 

 seeking to control. Detection and punishment of particular methods of people 

 smuggling or the drug trade or money laundering creates incentives to substitute and 

 to innovate. Transnational organised criminals will continue to adapt with new and 

 emerging technologies, which provide opportunities to increase the sophistication of 

 organised criminal offending.  They will continue to be dynamic and move into 

 markets and places where profits are to be made and where they perceive risks to 

 their operations to be lower.  Over the coming years, transnational organised crime 

 groups will seek to increasingly engage in the illicit cross border trade of intellectual 

 property rights, counterfeit goods and hazardous waste.   

 

 All of these activities pose major concerns for Australians.  In the face of this we will 

 need to improve existing intelligence and information sharing arrangements and 

 make the best use of the information that we already collect.  We will have to work 

 together, both within Australia and with our regional counterparts, to provide a 

 cohesive response to existing and emerging forms of organised crime.  In addition 

 we must be alive to the possibility that resource and supply constraints will cause 

 food and energy shortages, resulting in changes to patterns of trade, and to patterns 

 of movement of displaced people, and we must  prepare for this. 

 

 A fourth  and final strategic element is to realistically acknowledge the uncertainty 

 and be well prepared to re-calibrate strategies as risks emerge. Winston Churchill 

 said “when I look back on all these worries, I remember the story of the old man who 

 said on his deathbed that he had had a lot of trouble in his life, most of which had 

 never happened”. 

 

 Now this is sometimes misinterpreted as a lament, as a gripe about wasted time, but 

 of course it is no such thing. Churchill worried about a German invasion of mainland 

 Britain. That it did not ultimately happen did not render it a worthless concern or 

 something that he and Britain did not need to be well prepared to combat. In the 

 Page 8 of 9 

 same way, sensible border protection policy attends to the possibility of events which 

 are genuinely unpredictable but which we need to be prepared for. To quote 

 Churchill again, “let our advance worrying become advance thinking and planning”.  

 

 So what we have done is to build a border protection management system with 

 sufficient flexibility so that resources and policies can be quickly switched to 

 accommodate the changes in threats and the new strategies employed. There is a 

 particular requirement to think carefully through the consequences of low probability 

 - yet high impact events, and to design a border protection system which is 

 reasonably robust to those events.  The events that we cannot predict, but are 

 equally likely to shape the future of border management may include: 

 â¢ A well coordinated and executed terrorist attack such as the recent Jakarta 

 hotel bombings; 

 â¢ A catastrophic environmental event, such as the boxing day tsunami in 2004 

 or Hurricane Katrina in the United States in 2005; or 

 â¢ The emergence of a pandemic such as the Severe Acute Respiratory 

 Syndrome or SARS, or the more recent H1N1 2009 or Swine Flu. 

 

 In addition, uncertain considerations mean that the system should have capacity built 

 into it. In relation to people smuggling, the previous Government planned for this 

 when it spent more than $400 million building the substantial detention facilities at 

 Christmas Island. The Government is responding to the current flow of irregular boat 

 arrivals.  Australia’s detention facilities on Christmas Island have significant capacity, 

 and we ready to respond as issues emerge.   

 

 

 Conclusion  

 These four elements of the Government’s approach to border protection - to marshal 

 resources in a co-ordinated whole-of-government response to border management; 

 to know thyself; to know our enemy; and to accept uncertainty but be well prepared 

 to respond - directly inform the design of our border control regime.

 Our overarching objective, the challenge for border management agencies, is to 

 pursue border protection management which is intelligently designed, flexibly 

 organized, makes best use of resources, and is sufficiently resourced. The 

 Government is committed to ensuring that border management agencies are able to 

 meet this challenge. 

 

 Thank you
