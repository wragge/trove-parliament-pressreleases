Gerry Hand, MPParliament House, Canberra, A C T 2600  Telephone: (06) 277  7860MPS 29/91111 OOP PLACES IN 1991-92 MIGRATION PROGRAMThe Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, announced today that Australia would select up to ill 000 new settlers in 1991—92 — a reduction of 15 000 places on this year's planning level.Next year's program will comprise 56 000 places for family migrants, 42 500 for those in skilled categories, 12 000 for those in a new Refugees, Humanitarian and Special Assistance stream and 500 for special eligibility migrants.In other decisions announced .by Mr isandt -  -  - â   -  —  .- the Government has determiried*its migration program planning levels up to June 1994;- a "special assistance" program will target groups of people in special need who do not meet the refugee definition;- limited financial assistance will be provided to assist skilled independent migrants from East Europe;- increased information will be made available to prospective migrants in occupations which have limited job opportunities in the Australian labour market;- options to adjust the Business Migration Program (BMP) will be examined, and no new BMP agents will be accredited at present; and- the fee for some Change of Statue applications is to be increased.Mr Hand said the 1991-92 program figures had been determined against a background of falling demand forCOMMONWEALTH i { PARLIAMENTARY Ï DRARY IMICAH

 migration, coupled with the current limited job  opportunities in the work force. However they also took  into account medium-term economic prospects.

 "Our long-held view that Australia’s needs are best  served by a continuing immigration program, albeit one  fine-tuned to reflect current circumstances, has been  reinforced by the growing body of positive economic  evidence flowing from the Bureau of Immigration  Research."

 "The 1991-92 program will serve Australia well and will  continue to meet the Government’s objectives of  achieving a balanced intake of settlers from the family,  skilled and Refugees, Humanitarian and Special  Assistance streams."

 "The balance achieved over the past two years will be  maintained with some increased emphasis on our  humanitarian response"

 "I will also be monitoring world events in liaison with  my colleagues. If Australia's humanitarian response  proves to be inadequate, the Government will consider  allocating additional places to meet unforeseen need."

 Importantly the record skill level of over 27% achieved  during this program year is expected to be maintained or  bettered, even allowing for the increased humanitarian  commitment.

 Planning levels for ensuing two years

 Mr Hand said that to improve predictability the  Government had decided to announce indicative migration  planning levels in the non-humanitarian streams for the  ensuing two years of 106 000 and 116 000 places in 

 1992-93 and 1993-94 respectively.

 "This reflects the implications of current policy  settings relative to expected demand for migration.  Given changing world circumstances the Refugees,  Humanitarian and Special Assistance stream of 12 000  places would, in particular, need to be reviewed 

 annually."

 Mr Hand said the Government had decided on the forward  planning to meet the concerns of Government, business  and community groups over what was perceived as a lack  of predictability in the migration program.

 We recognise the difficulties this lack of planning in  advance has posed, particularly in ensuring that the

 3.

 program is able to meet the skilled entry needs of an  expanding economy," he said.

 "In announcing these planning levels the Government, of  course, is not committing itself to precise outcomes.

 "We may be better positioned to move to a more precise  triennium plan after we consider the National Population  Council report on population issues, due at the end of  this year. In this regard the NPC discussion paper is  being released today for public comment.

 "But the Government has announced levels which reflect  an expected natural increase in migration demand created  by a stronger economy over the next three years.

 "In this context, I would point out that we are  maintaining the record skill levels in following years."

 Mr Hand said the 1991-92 program contained some  innovative features.

 "Special assistance" category

 For example, the new Refugees, Humanitarian and Special  Assistance stream would cater not only for people  accepted under traditional refugee and other  humanitarian criteria, but would also admit under the 

 special assistance category certain people who did not  meet those criteria but were nevertheless considered by  the Government to be in special need. This will be done  in a way which will not compromise those who meet 

 existing refugee and humanitarian criteria.

 "This change will greatly increase the flexibility of  our overseas resettlement programs, " the Minister said.

 In the past there have been difficulties in fitting such  groups within the confines of the technical criteria of  our traditional resettlement programs.

 "But there are a number of groups both inside and  outside their own countries who have special links with  Australia and who are in special need. Decisions will  be made each year by the Government as to which groups 

 are in most need of the application of this program and  as to the numbers able to be accommodated."

 "They will be catered for in this new category."

 Loan assistance to East European migrants facing  currency restrictions

 Currency restrictions in the USSR and other East  European countries are imposing serious practical  barriers to skilled migration from these countries.  Australia is being denied access to a highly skilled  catchment group being actively sought by other  countries.

 To overcome this problem, Australia will establish a  revolving travel loan fund to assist up to 6 000 East  European migrants over three years who apply in the  independent category and who meet normal independent  selection criteria.

 The loans will cover travel costs and are to be repaid  within two years after the migrant arrives in Australia.

 "This innovation will ensure that Australia taps into a  valuable new source of skilled migrants and will also  help maintain the diversity of the overall immigration  program" Mr Hand said.

 Action in certain occupations where there are limited  job opportunities

 Mr Hand said the Government had addressed concerns that  the migration program led to an over-supply of labour in  some sectors of the market.

 With a view to moderating the problem, it had been  decided to identify occupations having particularly  limited job opportunities so that potential migrants can  be so informed and better assess the prospects of  securing employment on reaching Australia.

 The Minister said it was expected that this would have a  minimal impact on overall program numbers but would  nevertheless be important for the occupations targeted.

 Review of BMP and no new Business Migration agents to be  accredited

 Mr Hand foreshadowed the Government’s intention to look  at options for adjusting the Business Migration Program  (BMP).

 "In the light of concerns expressed about the operation  of the BMP, and the Department's own experience, I have

 5.

 decided to review the Program.  At the same time, I have  decided to suspend accreditation of new BMP agents."

 "I believe that there is a need to act now. But I am  also keen to have the benefit of the views of the Joint  Committee of Public Accounts which is currently  inquiring into the BMP."

 "However, because of slippage in the Committee's  reporting date by several months, I intend to contact  the Committee's chair, Mr Punch, to allow at least its  principal proposals to form part of my deliberations.  When its final report becomes available, I will consider  whether any further changes may be necessary."

 "I propose to make my announcements early in the program  year with a view to commencing implementation of changes  soon after. In the meantime, processing of BMP  applications will continue as normal pending amendment  to the current legislative entitlements."

 Increase in Change of Status fees

 In a further move to reflect the costs of processing  applications, the Minister said that fees for on-shore  change of status applications for the skilled stream  would be increased from the current $360 to $750. The 

 higher fee already applies to spouse/de facto  applicants.

 Program details are summarised in the attached table.
