 Cross-Appointments of MRT and RRT Completed 

 Two tribunals, the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT), will operate more effectively and efficiently after  the completion of cross-appointments today.

 Finalising a process that started last year, 16 existing part-time members of the MRT and 14 existing members of the RRT have been cross-appointed to the RRT and MRT respectively.

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs Senator Amanda Vanstone said the cross-appointments provided greater  flexibility to each tribunal in relation to allocating members to address changes in workload in each tribunal.

 ‘The cross-appointment of existing part-time Members will enable the tribunals to continue to deliver merits review in a fair, just, economical and  timely manner,’ Senator Vanstone said. 

 ‘In particular, it will assist the RRT meet the Government’s requirement at a maximum 90 days for RRT reviews.’

 Each of the cross-appointed part-time members is currently serving a three-year term with the MRT or RRT. Their cross-appointment starts on 14  November 2005 and will continue until their existing term expires on 30 June 2006. 

 There will now be 80 members appointed to the MRT (a principal member, three senior members, five full-time members and 71 cross-appointed  part-time members), and 87 members appointed to the RRT (a principal member, a deputy principal member, four senior members, 10 full-time  members and 71 cross-appointed part-time members).

 The MRT provides independent merits review of general migration decisions and the RRT provides independent merits review of decisions  relating to protection visas.
