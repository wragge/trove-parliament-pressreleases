 Rudd Ministers out of the depth  

 

 The litany of contradictory information and denials of any information at all are growing proof that the  Rudd Ministers responsible for Immigration and Home Security are completely out of their depth,  according to Dr Sharman Stone, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship.   

 “Australians are being told to believe that Senator Chris Evans, Minister for Immigration was not told  about the Federal Police briefings that rang alarm bells about their softening policy and people smuggling  activity.”   

 “Yet days after those briefings were revealed as fact, Minister Evans said he has still not asked for a copy  of the information.”    

 “It would also seem that the Bali Summit on people smuggling and people trafficking has disappeared  without a trace, without a single public communique, without any information about improved or better  resourced activity across the region,” Dr Stone said.   

 “Minister Evans, Minister Debus and  Foreign Affairs Minister Smith attended the two day summit but the  outcome is another one of their best kept secrets.”    

 Dr Stone said the contradictory information coming from the boat tragedy itself is a growing concern.    

 “Some officials are telling us that the people on board the boat were being towed to Christmas Island,  while other officials were saying the asylum seekers were not informed that they were being escorted to  Christmas Island,”    

 “The government needs to very urgently sort out what information was in fact given to the hapless  asylum seekers. Was this tragedy a trigger for a desperate attempt to have the boat escorted to Christmas  Island?” Dr Stone said.   

 “This part of the inquiry needs to be urgently resolved given there is apparently another boat approaching  Australia.  It is essential to find out if anything triggered the explosion and if so, that the trigger is well  understood by defence force personal.”   

 Dr Stone again called on the Rudd Labor Government to urgently focus on the problem at hand.   

 “ Mr Rudd needs to work more closely with Indonesian officials, reinstate the resources slashed from  budgets and urgently evaluate whether his ministers who are supposed  to be in control of these  departmental areas are actually up to this very important task,” Dr Stone said.
