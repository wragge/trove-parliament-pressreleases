 Tue, 29th January 2008   LABOR GOVERNMENT DIVIDED ON CITIZENSHIP TEST 

 Senator the Hon Christopher Ellison   Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Ellison, today said,  'Statements by the Prime Minister in relation to the question on Don Bradman and  the Citizenship Test are at odds with comments made by his Minister for Immigration  and Citizenship, Senator Evans'.  

 'Whilst Mr Rudd supports the question relating to Don Bradman, his Immigration  Minister believes it is a product of political interference by John Howard.  

 'Senator Evans has himself said the test is about values, traditions, history and  national symbols. One would think that questions of a sporting nature would not be in  conflict with those principles,' said Senator Ellison.  

 Senator Ellison said 'If the Government is serious about increasing the pass rate of  refugee and humanitarian migrants to that of skilled migrants it should simply look at  ways of providing better assistance in preparation for the test rather than making  wholesale changes'.  

 Senator Ellison accused Senator Evans of running an ideological agenda in his  review of the Citizenship Test which the Labor government did not reveal to the  Australian people in the election just two months ago.  

 'Labor in Opposition supported the Test and it should continue to do so rather than  run an ideological agenda of political correctness' said Senator Ellison.  

 'For the second time this month Senator Evans has sought to generate opposition to  the Citizenship Test. He first announced a review of the Test on New Years Day, in  doing so he used misleading statistics to justify a Trojan horse style review that could  lead to wholesale changes to a Test that is supported by the majority of Australians'',  Senator Ellison said.  

 On New Years Day, Mr Evans released statistics that purported to show around 20%  of people had failed the Citizenship Test. In fact he released the number of people  who passed the test on their first try. The true statistics showed that over 90% of  applicants passed on their first or subsequent attempts.  

 ''The Coalition believes that is important the new Australians demonstrate they  understand Australia's way of life and commit to upholding our laws and values. Mr  Evans seems to believe that Australian Citizenship is something that should come in  a wheeties box'', Senator Ellison said.
