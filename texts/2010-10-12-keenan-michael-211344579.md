 Michael Keenan, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection  Member for Stirling, WA 

 Frontline men and women exposed  because of Labor’s policy failures   12/10/10  

 Officers from Customs and Border Protection Command have been left to deal with  the consequences of Labor’s failure to control our borders Shadow Minister for  Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said today. 

 “It is not acceptable that our frontline Customs officers are contracting tuberculosis  from illegal boat arrivals - this Labor Government have put Customs’ officers’ lives  on the line by allowing this surge of arrivals to spiral out of control,” Mr Keenan said. 

 There have also been cases of typhoid, hepatitis and chicken pox detected in boat  arrivals. 

 “The men and women of Border Protection Command are doing it tough in some very  harsh conditions, yet one thing that stands out is the professionalism and dedication of  our patrol officers. 

 “Customs and Border Protection is already stretched beyond capacity and is being  asked by this Labor Government to do more whilst their budget and personnel  numbers have been cut. 

 “Despite the demands of intercepting illegal boat arrivals around the clock under  terrible conditions, they are still doing a stellar job. 

 “Julia Gillard and Labor inherited a robust system of border protection that deterred  people smugglers from bringing people to Australia illegally. 

 “Once Labor weakened this system they gave the green light for people smugglers to  go back into business and as result 173 boats have arrived in Australia illegally. 

 “This has placed incredible demands on our border protection forces and exposed  them to risks that they would not have to bare if Labor fixed the policies and put the  people smugglers out of business.
