 CHINESE STUDENTS FIASCO DEEPENS

 Australia is no longer in control of its immigration program. One of the  fundamental principles of immigration states:

 "..that it must be the role of the elected government, acting on behalf of and  with the support of the whole community, to make the final and absolute  decisions on who will or will not be granted entry to Australia on a temporary  or permanent basis."

 The immigration program of this government has been characterised by ad-hoc,  emotionally and politically motivated decisions which have run it out of control. The  program is now being driven under its own momentum and the government is  powerless, apparently, to do anything about it.

 Few other single decisions that Prime Minister Hawke has taken, have had the  profound repercussions his decision to give blanket protection to 20,000 PRC  nationals here after the Tienanmen Square massacre has had.

 The reverberations of this decision continue to impact significantly on policy  decisions across several portfolio areas.

 This budget has revealed at least two.

 Last year the Government refunded $29 million to students who had prepaid fees  to English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students institutions, but were  subsequently unable to come to Australia to undertake their course of study  because of changes in visa requirements.

 The changes in visa requirements were necessary, of course, to redress the appalling  situation where 25,000 students were "pipelined" into Australia under lower  qualifying criteria.

 Altogether, according to the budget papers, up to 15,000 visa applicants (11,000  form the PRC) are estimated to be eligible for refunds. In this year's budget a  further $49m has been allocated for 1991-92 and another $1.5 million for 1992-93.

 The reason for the increase in funding was revealed today by the architect of the  ELICOS shambles, Minister Dawkins.

 The Minister announced that the eligibility date for acceptance of claims for  refunds would be extended for another year, allowing students who have prepaid  fees before June 27 1991 to be able to claim refunds.

 Previously, only students who had prepaid fees before July 1990 were eligible.

 Although the Commonwealth is attempting to recover this money from the  institutions to whom advance fees were paid, it seems that the originally estimated  level of recovery of $30 million "has proved to be optimistic". The budget papers  tell us that the estimates have been revised accordingly, but not by how much.

 In my statement on budget night, I was alarmed by a statement which advised that  an additional 14,000 4-year temporary entry permits were to be granted on refugee  or humanitarian grounds next year.

 It seems that those extra 14,000 temporary entry permits are to be issued to the  spouses of those students currently in Australia on 4-year temporary entry permits.  These places are also granted where no test of bona-fides, based on need for  protection, has been undertaken.

 The decision of the Prime Minister to disregard due process and destroy the  principles of non-discrimination which are at the very foundation of our immigration  program has led to a situation which cannot possibly be justified on any grounds at  all.

 This government has managed to discredit Australia's immigration program in the  eyes of her people and the international community and for this it should be duly  censured.
