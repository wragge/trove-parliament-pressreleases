 Auburn Migrant Resource Centre Benefits Community

 10 June 2005

 The Australian Government is continuing to help thousands of migrants and refugees successfully settle in the Central  Western Suburbs of Sydney every year. 

 The Australian Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Peter McGauran, today attended the Open Day of  Auburn Migrant Resource Centre and launched the ‘African Refugee Youth Profile in Auburn LGA’.

 'Nearly 6000 migrants and refugees have settled in Auburn over the past five years from countries as diverse as China,  Afghanistan and Sudan,” Minister McGauran said.

 'Auburn is one of the most culturally diverse areas in Sydney, with 52 per cent of residents born overseas.

 'The Migrant Resource Centre creates a vital link between the incoming settlers and their new community by providing  assistance in a variety of areas including housing and employment. 

 'Since opening in 1996, the Auburn Migrant Resource Centre has provided services to more than 166 000 migrants and 

 refugees helping them to develop a sense of belonging and to contribute to their community socially and economically.

 'In 2005-06, the Auburn Migrant Resource Centre has been allocated more than $1.3 million in core funding and grants  from the Australia Government to further improve settlement services. This includes a specific project to address the needs  of refugee youth.

 'The Australian Government is always looking for better ways to help new arrivals settle into their new community,'  Minister McGauran said.
