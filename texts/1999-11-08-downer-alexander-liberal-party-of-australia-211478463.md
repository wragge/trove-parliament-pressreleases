  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

  ALEXANDER DOWNER

  

 FA 126

  8 November 1999

  

  

  I have today announced the appointment of Mr David Irvine as Australia's 
Ambassador to the People’s Republic of China, w ith non-resident 
accreditation to Mongolia. Mr Irvine will replace Mr Richard Smith AO, 
who has been Ambassador since March 1996.

  

 Australia recognises China s importance in regional 
and international affairs. The relationship with China is one of our 
four key bilateral relationships Earlier this year Australia hosted 
an historic visit by President Jiang Zemin the first ever by a Chinese 
head of sate. Australia and China share strong interests in the stability 
and economic dynamism of the region. as well as in important multilateral 
issues such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the World Trade Organisation 
(WTO) and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).

  

 The bilateral relationship continues to mature and 
encompasses a wide range of interests. . Linkages include defence exchanges 
and ships’ visits; regular military military discussions; an annual 
human rights dialogue; consular consultations; regular foreign policy 
dialogue; social security exchanges; dialogue on regional security issues; 
an upgraded and expanded Joint Ministerial Economic Commission; cooperation 
on the repatriation of illegal boat people; and a recent notable expansion 
of links in the legal and judicial areas.

  

 Cultural legal, scientific and educational exchanges 
are also increasing people-to-people contacts. Implementation of China 
s designation of Australia as an approved tourist destination will lead 
to increased numbers of Chinese tourists visiting Australia.

  

 Australia is the fifth largest bilateral aid donor 
to China. Development assistance is targeted at needy areas of rural 
China and at supporting Chinese Government reforms in the public and 
financial sectors.

  

 Bilateral trade and economic ties continue to expand, 
with two-way trade for financial year 1998-99 worth more than $10 billion 
Two way investment links are also substantial China is Australia’s 
fifth largest. trading partner, and Australia is China’s eleventh 
largest bilateral trading partner. Increasingly, traditional Australian 
exports of primary products are diversifying into new areas such as 
manufactures telecommunications equipment, and financial, legal, health, 
tourism and: education services. Strong potential for growth exists 
in agribusiness and sales of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

  

 Australia enjoys warm relations with Mongolia, and 
is assisting Mongolia in its transition to a marker economy through 
capacity building and development assistance projects administered by 
AusAID
