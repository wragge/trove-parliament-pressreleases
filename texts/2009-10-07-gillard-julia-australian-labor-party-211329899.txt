 It is wonderful to be back in Washington and to be launching a literary contribution that will  enable Americans to understand a little more about Australia and for Australians to  appreciate what it is like to compete in a market as large and as diverse as the United States. 

 Literature has the capacity to illuminate a country, its culture, people and values like no other  field of study.   

 Literary anthologies in their own right become part of a country’s narrative by their  inclusions, exclusions, racial and gender biases, and chronology of literary history.     

 Professor Jose himself says the impetus for the anthology arose in an atmosphere of crisis in  relation to literacy, the teaching of English in schools, the study of literature in universities  and the condition of Australian publishing. 

 Indeed the production of this volume with its scale and ambition indicates the simultaneous  neglect and cherishing of our own culture. Given the high profile Australian culture and  literature enjoys, it is surprising to hear there was no comprehensive anthology of Australian  literature in print six years ago. 

 It is a major contribution to Australia’s literary history. It recalls some graphic, scarifying  moments from our recent and more distant past. It contains some exquisite writing, fictional  and non-fiction. 

 We need to thank several people - most especially the writers whose work is represented  here.  

 There is also Nick as the general editor and the large number of editors underneath him.  

 Then there is PEN - the association of Poets and Playwrights, Essayists and Editors, and  Novelists - which started in Australia in the 1930s and which has been a fierce advocate for  freedom of expression. Its campaigns for writers and artists who have been victims of  political imprisonment have been powerful and effective. 

 The Australian Academy of the Humanities, Macquarie University and the original  Australian publisher, Allen and Unwin, were also instrumental in bringing the project to  fruition. 

 And this edition is being published by WW Norton, which is based in New York. It is a  publisher that has had a long connection with Australia, publishing American editions of  Henry Handel Richardson and Katherine Susannah Pritchard among others. 

 This is an anthology for its time.   

 Like any great historical text it will - and indeed in Australia already has - stirred fierce  debate and feeling regarding its composition.   

 But just as the inclusions - by the novelists, poets, explorers - provide an insight into  Australian society and culture, so too does the debate provide a window into the heart and  mind of Australians and how we still grapple with our colonial and indigenous history, our  identity and place in the world.   

 For our friends - scholars and voracious readers alike - in the United States, the anthology  provides a personal insight into these national stories in a way that only talented writers can.    

 Americans will recognise many of the themes: a post-colonial past. Early writing that is  informed by a pioneering spirit and dislocation in a strange new land. There is the anguish of  Indigenous dispossession. 

 Landscapes have figured strongly in our tradition as the land and the elements play with our  imagination. 

 Egalitarianism and anti-authoritarianism too have a strong impact on our literature, as white  society freed itself from Old World class and privilege. 

 And there is the exploration of relationships that are fraught or dangerous or passionate or all  of the above.  

 Nick and his editors have selected well. They have assembled a body of writing that conveys  the yearning for a certain distinctiveness in the Australian voice. It is not a voice that is  strident or over-reaching or apologetic. It is unique, it has character and it has warmth. 

 Migration has been a constant theme in the literatures of Australia and America. The  expression of difference, identity and desire has been coursing through our literature for  many decades. Appropriately this anthology is bookended by the observations of the first  white settlers and the short stories of Vietnamese born Australian Chi Vu. 

 These contributors exemplify the diversity of being Australian - from explorers looking to  establish penal settlements to refugees seeking freedom and safety.   

 A national story present in this anthology like no other before is our Indigenous heritage told  through biography, petitions, pamphlets and other works. 

 Nick has encountered some criticism for the extent to which this book draws on this story and  these sources.      

 Inevitably some parts of an anthology cannot help but be political because writers do change  and transform - through their own experience or history’s own judgement. In Australia that  journey has often been from chronicling to dissenting.   

 This anthology also looks to our future with its inclusion of works from our Asian neighbours  who write of their Australian experience. This is also a testament to the General Editor’s  knowledge as a Sinophile.   

 Allow me to end my comments on the anthology with some Australian treasures that capture  a culture more succinctly than any essay or survey. 

 Mulga Bill’s Bicycle and The Magic Pudding are not only literary staples from our school  years; their language is quintessentially Australian. Our modern Australian export in this vein  is Barry Humphrey (as Dame Edna): 

 Australia is a Saturday  With races on the trannie  Australia is the talcy smell   Of someone else’s granny… 

 Australia is a sunburnt land   Of sand and surf and snow  All ye who do not know her  Ye know where you can go  

 I urge you to delve and to roam  and to enjoy the poetry of Nick Cave, a speech from Paul  Keating, a memoir by Germaine Greer and the classics of Henry Lawson, Mary Gilmore,  Patrick White, Peter Carey and Helen Garner. 

 Great to take with you and to be seen with at the ‘Australia Presents’ features that are coming  to Washington. The line up includes a major Indigenous art show, ‘Culture Warriors’,  currently at the Katzen Arts Centre and Cate Blanchett playing Blanche Dubois in ‘A Street  Car Named Desire’.    

 Congratulations again Nick and everyone involved. We can be confident that all your years  of research and editing will result in new interest and energy in the reading and teaching of  Australian literature everywhere. 

 It is with great pride and pleasure that I launch The Anthology of Australian Literature in the  United States.
