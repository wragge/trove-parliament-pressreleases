 Unauthorised Boat Arrivals - Government Responses Not Working Says Labor Con Sciacca - Shadow Minister for Immigration

 Media Statement - 21 August 2001

 The arrival last night of yet another boat of asylum seekers on Ashmore reef - bringing the number to 451 in the last five days - clearly shows that the Howard Government has no answer to the unauthorised boat arrivals problem according to Shadow Minister for Immigration Con Sciacca.

 "For all their bravado and chest-beating, Prime Minister John Howard and Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock have failed miserably to stem the numbers of asylum seekers arriving on our coastline.

 "In the last ten years there have been approximately 12,700 unauthorised arrivals. The vast majority of them, over 10,000 have arrived since the Howard Government came to power in March 1996 (see table below)," Mr Sciacca said.

 Mr Sciacca said that the Government's response over the last five years had been largely limited to introducing domestic legislative changes which were supposed to help slow the number of unauthorised arrivals.

 These measures included a new temporary protection visa regime, tougher border control measures, increased jail terms for people smugglers and boat crews, tougher laws for troublemakers in detention centres and special strip-search powers, all of which have received bi-partisan support from the Opposition.

 "Clearly the Government has failed to find an effective solution. It is time to acknowledge that introducing more domestic legislation will not deter the people smugglers.

 "In late 1999 Mr Ruddock with Opposition support secured Parliament's approval to a new regime of Temporary Protection Visas for unauthorised arrivals with genuine claims to protection. At the time, Minister Ruddock predicted that this change would provide a strong disincentive and stem the flow of illegal arrivals.

 Yet since the Bill was passed in November 1999 over 6000 asylum seekers have arrived by boat - almost

 50% of the total number of boat arrivals since 1989.

 "Mr Howard and Mr Ruddock are in charge of Australia's Immigration program and Australia's immigration policy. No amount of chest beating and attempts to shift responsibility for their failures can disguise the fact that Australia is seen as a soft touch by overseas criminals involved in the lucrative and insidious people smuggling racket," Mr Sciacca said.

 Mr Sciacca said that if the Government were serious, they would establish an Australian Coastguard service, which would act as a maritime police force and send a message to overseas criminal gangs that Australia is serious about protecting its borders.

 "It is time that the Government acknowledged that their domestic solutions are not working and that a fresh, broader approach is clearly required", Mr Sciacca said.
