 GAMO GEMEDA - ETHIOPIAN STOWAWAY CASE MPS 02/86

 The Acting Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Peter Morris, said in Canberra today (Friday) that  Gamo Gemeda, an 18-year old Ethiopian stowaway, would be  transferred today under escort from Adelaide to the 

 Department's detention centre in Melbourne. His detention  was approved by a Magistrate in Adelaide on January 8,  1985.

 "The move follows Mr Gemeda1s release from the Flinders  Medical Centre after treatment for a self-inflicted knife  wound", Mr Morris said.

 "As there is no immigration detention centre in Adelaide  it has been decided to move him to the nearest such  centre, which is Melbourne.

 "Mr Gemeda will today lodge an application for refugee  status. This application will be considered as quickly as  possible by the Determination of Refugee Status Committee,  which has been specifically established to advise the  Minister in determining refugee claims.

 "Mr Gemeda1s future will be decided as soon as possible  following receipt of the DORS Committee reports", Mr Morris said.
