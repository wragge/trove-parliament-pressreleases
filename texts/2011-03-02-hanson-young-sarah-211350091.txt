 900 Genuine Refugees In Limbo And Waiting For Answers  

 

 The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security should immediately review the  cases of the 900 refugees who are currently in detention awaiting security  assessment, the Australian Greens said. 

 “In Senate Estimates (Monday last week) when questioning the Immigration  Department, I was astounded to learn that 900 people who have been found to be  genuine refugees are still languishing in detention simply because of ASIO’s back-log,” said the Greens’ Immigration Spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.  

 “Many of these 900 refugees have been detained for over 12 months, including  families with small children.” 

 “These refugees are stuck in a terrible legal limbo. Having been found to be in  genuine need of protection, they can’t be returned home for fear of persecution. Yet,  they can’t be released into the Australian community until ASIO completes their  security assessment. They are simply forced to wait indefinitely.” 

 “These people are being denied natural justice.  Those who are found to have an  adverse security assessment are not provided with any reason for the decision or  given an opportunity to respond. With no time limit for ASIO to complete these 

 assessments, the immigration department has admitted that this means the indefinite  detention of genuine refugees.”  

 “It seems the Government has forgotten their policy of ending indefinite detention -  leaving these 900 men, women and children to languish in detention for no one  knows how long,” Senator Hanson-Young said.   

 New Zealand have independent oversight of their security agency’s decisions, in  relation to asylum seekers. The Greens are investigating the potential for a similar  approach here in Australia:  

 “Of course there must be a security assessment process, but this should be  accountable and not shrouded in secrecy.”  

 “The Government should ensure there is accountability and procedural fairness  within the Australian system, by charging the Inspector-General of Intelligence and  Security with performing similar functions,” said Senator Hanson-Young.
