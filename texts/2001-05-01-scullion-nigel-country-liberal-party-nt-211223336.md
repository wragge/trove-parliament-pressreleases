 Media Release 

 One-off homelessness projects receive over $230,000 funding 

 01/05/2007 

 Education programs, training and resource packages, support groups and CD rom manuals are  among the projects to be funded to help increase the community's knowledge of homelessness,  Minister for Community Services, Senator Nigel Scullion, announced today.   

 Six projects in Queensland, Western Australia and Victoria will share in funding of over $230,000  under the National Homelessness Strategy (NHS) Communication Activities program.    

 "The Australian Government has recognised that homelessness is a complex issue which requires  varied solutions for different communities. Through the NHS we are working to create flexible and  practical solutions for individual communities.    

 "Each of the successful applicants will receive up to $40,000 for small scale, one off initiatives. These  projects have demonstrated that their proposed activities will increase knowledge of homelessness,  promote collaboration across government programs and sectors and are cost effective.   

 "The recipients can now work towards the implementation of more streamlined services, the  development of training and resource kits and the adaptation of templates and toolkits from  international models.   

 "Today's funding announcement is part of the $10 million allocated in 2005 to the NHS over four  years for Demonstration Projects and Communication Activities and shows the Australian  Government's leadership in approaches to preventing and reducing homelessness.    

 "The NHS aims to improve the links between existing programs and services, to better develop  outcomes for clients and to identify ways of reducing the incidence of homelessness.   

 "The Australian Government will continue to support services providers who, by working with people  affected by homelessness, are able to suggest and implement innovative and targeted solutions,"  Senator Scullion said.
