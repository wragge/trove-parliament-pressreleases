 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling Another daily hatrick of boat arrivals under  Labor November 03, 2012

 Three boat arrivals, carrying 165 people, in 24 hours highlights the continuing dominance of people smugglers over the  Labor Government, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “Only yesterday was the Minister for Immigration claiming that the boats were slowing but the figures show the rate of  arrivals is actually increasing,” Mr Keenan said.

 “With October being the biggest month for boat arrivals on record, November is starting off exactly the same.

 "It is evident that this Government does not have the policies, money or will to adequately protect Australia’s borders. 

 “Amongst recent reports of hunger strikes at the Nauru detention centre, alleged acts of piracy at sea, billion dollar budget  blowouts and unprecedented rates of illegal boat arrivals, Labor still expects the Australian people to trust them with the  vital role of protecting our country’s borders.

 “The Australian people have had enough of Labor’s inability to stop the people smugglers as they continue to use Border  Protection Command vessels as a daily water taxi service.

 “Once again the hard working men and women of Border Protection Command face a challenging month of  unprecedented numbers of arrivals with the limited resources provided to them by Labor.

 “This is a Government that refuses to take responsibility for the crisis they created at our borders - they do not have the  resolve or the credibility to stop the people smugglers.

 “Only by implementing the full suite of Howard Government policies will you get Howard Government results,” Mr Keenan  said.
