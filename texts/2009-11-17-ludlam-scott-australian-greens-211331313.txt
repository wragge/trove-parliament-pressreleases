 Scott Ludlam   Australia must seize chance to force change in  Burma - Greens  Media Release | Spokesperson Scott Ludlam

 The Australian Greens are calling on the federal government to seize a historic opportunity to force Burma's 

 military regime on a democratic path.  

 Speaking at the first ever US-ASEAN summit on the weekend, President Barack Obama called for the unconditional 

 release of political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and for Rangoon to begin genuine dialogue with the 

 democratic opposition and minority groups on a shared vision for the future.  

 "The Foreign Minister's comments on Burma at the recent APEC meeting seemed strangely out of step with the 

 changing situation: we need to urgently scale up the pressure on the regime and do everything we can to support 

 pro-democracy campaigners," said Greens Senator Scott Ludlam.   

 "Overnight revelations that Aun Sang Suu Kyi has requested meetings with the secretive regime should spur the 

 Australian Government to take meaningful action, introducing trade sanctions and targeting a portion of our aid 

 spe



 nding to the vast refugee camps on the Thai-Burma border.  

 "In Senate estimates hearings in October 2009, the Government acknowledged "There is an ongoing process ... 

 under which Australian sanctions are ... reconsidered and reviewed," and that "there was a real interest in ... 

 having a look at the whole package of sanctions that we had in place against Burma and reconsidering."  

 "The process alluded to in the hearings should be drawn to a rapid conclusion, starting with the abandonment of 

 the policy to neither support nor oppose trade sanctions.  

 "With the United States moving to leverage tougher sanctions in negotiations with the regime, it is time Australia 

 stepped up similar trade sanctions in the run-up to the sham 2010 election in Burma," Senator Ludlam concluded.
