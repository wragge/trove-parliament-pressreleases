 Easy Come, Easy Go 

 

 The Government has once again failed in its protection of Australia’s  maritime regions.    

 Revelations that a detained Indonesian fishing vessel and its four crew were  able to simply slip mooring and sail out of detention, point to a government  incapable of policing Australia’s territorial waters.   

 The vessel, the Baktra Ayu, and its crew were detained near Horn Island in the  Torres Strait awaiting a court hearing for allegedly fishing illegally in Australian  waters. Rather than facing the full weight of the law, the crew of the Baktra  Ayu, was able to simply sail out of detention, undetected by a government  that has placed the protection of Australia’s maritime regions in the too hard  basket.   

 Following up on the failure of the government to interdict any of the people  smuggling boats arriving in Australia in the last two years, the inability of the  government to locate this alleged fugitive fish poacher, clearly shows that  the reality of Australia’s maritime boarder protection is, easy come, easy go.  Australia deserves a guarded coastline, which means we deserve an  Australian Coastguard.   

 The government can not excise its way out of this failure to protect Australia’s  maritime regions, and it can’t even blame the Senate. It is becoming obvious  that in fact, it is the government that is asleep at the wheel of Australian  maritime law enforcement.
