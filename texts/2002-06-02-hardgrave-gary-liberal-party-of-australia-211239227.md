 500 New Aussies for Queensland Week

 More than 500 people will become Australian citizens at a citizenship ceremony in Brisbane to mark Queensland Week 2002, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, announced today.

 Mr Hardgrave said he was thrilled such a high number of people had chosen to take this important step on such a memorable occasion in Queensland.

 He said Australian citizenship was the single most unifying force in the Australian community.

 "Australian citizenship is a cornerstone of our culturally diverse society. Choosing to become an Australian citizen is an important expression of loyalty and commitment to Australia and its people," Mr Hardgrave said.

 "Maintaining our high rate of citizenship is important in continuing to build Australia's unified, inclusive and participative community."

 As well, an affirmation ceremony will be held in which all Australians are invited, on a voluntary basis, to publicly affirm their loyalty and commitment to Australia.

 Mr Hardgrave said affirmation ceremonies enhanced awareness of Australian citizenship and promoted community involvement and participation.

 "They also help build pride in Australians about their citizenship. All Australians, both citizens and non-citizens, are invited to participate in affirmation ceremonies," he said.

 Queensland Day is celebrated on June 6 and marks Queensland's separation from the colony of NSW in 1859.

 This year the celebrations, which focus on the State's history and development and the achievements of Queenslanders, have been extended to a week.

 Citizenship ceremonies have been planned across the State, including the Logan City Council and Cairns City Council.

 The 500 new citizens in Brisbane will join more than 12,000 Queenslanders who have become Australian citizens this year, an increase of 42 per cent from 2001.

 Mr Hardgrave said there were still more than 900,000 overseas-born people living in Australia who were eligible to apply for citizenship but had not done so.

 More than 150 000 of them were living in Queensland, or 15.9 per cent of all eligible Australians.

 Mr Hardgrave encouraged all eligible non-citizens to consider becoming an Australian citizen, which was an important link towards developing community harmony.

 "Since 1949, more than 3.1 million people have become Australian citizens, providing

 them with privileges as well as a number of important responsibilities."

 The Queensland Week citizenship ceremony will be held at the Roma Street Parkland, Celebration Lawn, Brisbane, on Sunday 2 June from 1.30pm to 3.45pm.

 Family Become Part of the 'Melting Pot'

 Mr Abdul Tejan University scholar Brisbane

 An opportunity to study for a masters degree in Australia became a turning point in the lives of Abdul Tejan and his family when he decided to stay permanently.

 Mr Tejan said fighting in his home country of Sierra Leone convinced him to stay in Australia and arrange for his wife, Patricia, and children Katumu, 18, Abdul, 12, and Aminah, 10, to join him.

 On Sunday 2 June, Mr Tejan, his wife and his two youngest children will become Australian citizens at a Citizenship Ceremony in Brisbane to mark Queensland Week.

 The eldest child, Katumu, plans to become an Australian citizen as soon as she is eligible.

 Mr Tejan, who has lived in England, Liberia and Kenya, said his family had decided to become Australian citizens in order to become a part of the community.

 Describing Australia as a melting pot of cultures, Mr Tejan said he and his family were eager to become fully integrated in Australian life.

 "I have mixed with a lot of Australians and it's just a perfect place to live," he said.

 "You can walk the streets and hear people speaking in different languages - it makes a very good blend."

 Mr Tejan said his family had settled in well to Australian life because the people were very hospitable and the atmosphere was peaceful.

 His daughter Aminah almost had an Australian accent and the family had made many Australian friends.

 "They like it here very much so. They will visit Sierra Leone one day when they are grown up but they are integrated fully now," he said.

 Mr Tejan said the weather conditions and environment reminded his family of their home country, which also made their transition easier.

 When Mr Tejan first arrived and went on a field trip in Queensland as part of his studies, he was amazed to discover similar vegetation.

 "I almost kissed the (forest) floor because it was very much like back home," he said.

 Mr Tejan is now completing a PhD in forestry at the University of Queensland. His youngest children attend primary school and Katumu is in high school.

 He has taken his family on trips to the Gold Coast and national parks and said his family

 was looking forward to becoming "Aussies" on Sunday.

 "There's everything we can wish for here."

 An Oasis 'Down Under'

 Dr Juan Semo Business development manager Brisbane

 While some people dream of riches, fame and success, Dr Juan Semo and his family had only one dream - to become Australians.

 On Sunday 2 June, this dream will come true when they become Australian citizens at a Citizenship Ceremony in Brisbane.

 Before the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, Dr Semo, his wife Marina and children Daniel, 19, and Esther, 10, will join 500 others in becoming Australian citizens during Queensland Week celebrations.

 Dr Semo and his family have lived in several countries, including the country of his birth, Mexico, but all believed Australia should be home.

 "My family all agreed Australia was the best. We took a very conscious decision and fought for it," Dr Semo said.

 "The most important thing we have been trying to do is to understand what it means to become an Australian."

 "We understood very fast that in order to make this home we needed to become Australian."

 He said the family made a joint decision to become citizens because they wanted to feel part of the community and contribute to it.

 "I think that at one stage in your life you need to take an absolute decision and accept all the rights and obligations of being where you are," he said.

 "From Sunday on we are the co-owners of the same place as people who were born here or came before us and with this ownership we have rights and obligations that we have to face. This is very important to us."

 Dr Semo described Australian as an oasis - an oasis in terms of opportunity, culture and human rights.

 He praised Australia's multiculturalism, peaceful existence and high economic standards.

 "I think that Australia is a young country with unique opportunities if we compare it with other countries in the world," he said.

 "I think that all those fantastic qualities need to be developed every day by all the citizens who have the privilege to live in this oasis."

 Dr Semo migrated to Australia in 1998 and now has his own company, Australian

 Network of Entrepreneurial Wealth, which helps small businesses with marketing and sales.

 His son, Daniel, is in his third year of a Science degree at the University of Queensland and his daughter, Esther, attends primary school.

 Dr Semo said it was important migrants did not isolate themselves from the community. He and his family had made many Australian friends and were pleased to be joining them as citizens.

 "We are very proud and honoured to become Australians."

 Holiday Romance Becomes Permanent

 Mr Hai Vu Registered Nurse Brisbane

 A holiday romance became more permanent for Vietnamese-born Hai Vu when he met the woman he would later marry and decided to migrate to Australia to be with her.

 Mr Vu was born in Vietnam and fled by boat as a refugee to Belgium when he was 13. He lived in Belgium for 18 years, the last five working as a registered nurse, but was eager to leave because of the cold weather.

 It was on a holiday to Australia in 1996 to visit his mother, sister and brother that Mr Vu met Thanh Nguyen, a Vietnamese-born Australian citizen.

 Two years later they were married and on Sunday Mr Vu will become an Australian citizen at a Citizenship ceremony in Brisbane to mark Queensland Week 2002.

 Mr Vu said it was important for him to become a citizen to feel a part of the community and become involved in Australian life.

 He said becoming a citizen would give him the same rights and responsibilities as other Australians.

 "You have more right to have your opinions," Mr Vu said.

 He said Australians were very friendly and he enjoyed the weather and lifestyle.

 "There are more opportunities for me to get more skills," Mr Vu said.

 Mr Vu works as a registered nurse at Sunnybank Private Hospital and is studying for a masters degree in Nursing at the Queensland University of Technology.

 He has a son, Kelvin, 22 months, and his wife is due to give birth in December.

 The family has been on trips together to Sydney, Canberra and the Gold Coast.

 DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS

 90. AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP Having the citizenship of a particular country generally means you are recognised officially as a ‘member’ of that country, with certain responsibilities and privileges.

 Usually people born in Australia of Australian parents become Australian citizens by birth; those people who migrate here can acquire citizenship by application upon meeting certain criteria.

 Background

 From the time of European settlement until 1949, anyone born or naturalised in Australia was a "British subject." The Nationality and Citizenship Act 1949, which came into being on 26 January 1949, created Australian citizenship.

 The Act prescribes the ways in which Australian citizenship can be acquired and lost. It has undergone many changes in the past 52 years, including a name change to the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 on 17 September 1973. 

 Another change occurred in January 1994, with the introduction of a new Pledge of Commitment as a Citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia, to replace the Oath of Allegiance. 

 The pledge reads:

 From this time forward, under God, * I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I will uphold and obey.

 * All new citizens have the choice of making the pledge with or without the words "under God".

 Responsibilities and privileges

 Immigrants becoming Australian citizens have the same basic responsibilities and privileges as Australian-born citizens. They:

 â¢ must enrol on the electoral register and vote in elections;

 â¢ may apply for appointment to public office, nominate to stand for election as a Member of Parliament, apply to enlist in the defence forces or for those Government jobs for which citizenship is required;

 â¢ may apply for an Australian passport;

 â¢ may re-enter Australia without the need for a re-entry visa when they travel overseas;

 â¢ have the right to seek assistance from the Australian Government if required when travelling; and

 â¢ may register their children born subsequently overseas as Australian citizens.

 Those accepting citizenship are expected to be loyal to Australia and its people, share in the belief of the democratic process, respect the rights and liberties of other Australians, and uphold and obey Australia's laws. They must serve on a jury if called to do so, and must help defend Australia should the need arise.

 Citizenship by birth

 Most people born in Australia before 26 January 1949 became Australian citizens on that day. Between that date and 19 August 1986, people born in Australia automatically became Australian citizens unless one of their parents was a foreign diplomatic or consular official.

 Since 20 August 1986, citizenship is acquired if, at the time of the person's birth in Australia, at least one parent is either an Australian citizen or a permanent resident of Australia.

 Applying for grant of citizenship

 Generally, people are eligible for Australian citizenship when they have been present in Australia as a permanent resident for a total of two years in the previous five years, including 12 months in the two years immediately before they

 FACT SHEET

 2

 apply. While there are some exceptions, people seeking citizenship must:

 â¢ be a permanent resident and at least 18 years of age;

 â¢ be capable of understanding the nature of their citizenship application;

 â¢ have a basic knowledge of the English language;

 â¢ understand the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship;

 â¢ be of good character; and

 â¢ be likely to live permanently in Australia or maintain a close and continuing association with Australia.

 Children under 16 years old may be included on a responsible parent’s application.  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has discretion, in certain circumstances, to grant citizenship to children aged 16 or 17 who apply in their own right.

 There is a fee of $120 to apply for grant of citizenship. For those on Australian Centrelink or Department of Veterans’ Affairs age, wife, disability support, age service and invalidity service pensions, and mature age and mature age (partner) allowance, the fee is $20. There is no fee for former British child migrants and those people who have served at least three months in Australia’s permanent defence forces.

 The meaning of citizenship

 Potential new citizens are provided with a copy of the book What it means to be an Australian citizen, a publication produced by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural aqnd Indigenous Affairs.

 The booklet includes brief summaries of Australian history, heritage, symbols, institutions and laws, and was designed to assist new citizens gain a better understanding of their new country.

 Citizenship for adopted children

 A child who is a permanent resident and who is legally adopted in Australia (after 22 November 1984) acquires Australian citizenship automatically when adopted if at least one adoptive parent is an Australian citizen at the time.

 A child who is adopted overseas by Australian citizens may be granted citizenship in certain circumstances.

 Citizenship by descent

 People born overseas to a parent who is an Australian citizen may apply for registration as an Australian citizen by descent, if they meet certain criteria.

 The application fee is $110 (additional children lodged at the same time - $85 each). 

 Losing Australian citizenship

 Adult Australians who deliberately seek and acquire citizenship of another country lose their Australian citizenship once they take up the other country's citizenship.

 Australians who acquire another citizenship automatically rather than by taking some action to acquire it do not lose their Australian citizenship.

 Adults can also lose Australian citizenship by renouncing Australian citizenship, or by being deprived of Australian citizenship because of such factors as a conviction for providing false or misleading information when obtaining citizenship.

 A child under 18 years of age will lose Australian citizenship if a responsible parent of the child ceases to be an Australian citizen. However, this would not happen if it would result in the child having no citizenship, or if one responsible parent was still an Australian citizen. 

 Resuming Australian citizenship

 People who ceased to be an Australian as a result of taking action to acquire another citizenship, may resume Australian citizenship if they:

 â¢ show that they did not know they would lose their Australian citizenship, or would have suffered significant hardship or detriment had they not acquired the other citizenship;

 â¢ have lived in Australia for at least two years during their lifetime and either indicate that they will continue to live in Australia, or if now living overseas, that they will live in Australia within three years; and

 â¢ have maintained a close and

 3

 continuing association with Australia.

 Factors considered as acceptable examples of significant hardship and detriment range from loss of cultural heritage to restrictions on access to social security benefits or difficulties associated with frequent travel.

 Alternatively, people who have lost their Australian citizenship may apply to be granted Australian citizenship after 12 months from when they lost it.  They must meet the requirements for grant of Australian citizenship described above, with the exception of the requirement to be present in Australia for two years in the five years prior to application.

 There is a fee of $65 to apply for resumption of Australian citizenship.

 Dual/plural citizenship

 Australian citizens may hold the citizenship of another country (dual citizenship) or more than one other country (plural citizenship) in certain circumstances.

 â¢ Migrants who become Australian citizens may retain their former citizenship if the laws of their former country allow them to do so. 

 â¢ Australian citizens who lost their Australian citizenship by deliberately acquiring another citizenship and who resume Australian citizenship may retain their other citizenship if the laws of that country allow them to do so.

 â¢ Children may be entitled to both Australian citizenship and another citizenship by birth, by virtue of their parent’s citizenship.

 â¢ Australian citizens who acquire the citizenship of another country automatically through the legislation of that country, for example by marriage.

 Many dual/plural citizens hold passports of more than one country.  However, Australian citizens should use their Australian passports to pass through Immigration/Customs clearance when returning to Australia.  

 This is because an Australian passport is the only definitive evidence that proves the traveller is an Australian citizen.  Without an Australian passport, delays may be experienced while the traveller’s Australian citizenship is verified.

 Under section 44(i) of the Australian Constitution, Australian citizens who hold any

 other citizenship and who wish to stand for public office as Parliamentarians in Australia must take ‘all reasonable steps’ to divest themselves of all other citizenships before nomination for Parliament.

 Some countries require their citizens to make a formal application to renounce their citizenship. For example, British citizenship may be renounced upon application, seeking approval of the British Home Secretary.

 Generally, the Department is not aware if an individual holds another citizenship unless it comes to its attention in some way, for instance, at time of application for grant of Australian citizenship.  The Department does not know, or need to know, if a person has taken any steps to renounce any other citizenship. 

 Citizenship statistics

 At the 1996 Census, there were 15.89 million Australian citizens in Australia.

 Based on population census data, an estimated additional 969,300 people would be entitled to take out citizenship if they wished. In recent years, the number of people conferred citizenship has been:

 1993-94 112,186

 1994-95 114,757

 1995-96 111,637

 1996-97 108,266

 1997-98 112,343

 1998-99 76,474

 1999-2000 70,836

 2000-2001 72,070

 In 2000-2001, people from over 150 different countries took out Australian citizenship. The major countries of former nationality or citizenship were:

 United Kingdom 12,474

 New Zealand 11,007

 China 6,890

 South Africa 2,992

 Bosnia-Herzegovina              2,661 India 2,335

 Philippines 2,211

 Vietnam 1,953

 Citizenship ceremonies

 Citizenship ceremonies are generally the responsibility of local governments and are conducted by those authorities at times and venues of their choice. Some smaller

 4

 ceremonies are occasionally arranged at offices of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in Australia in special circumstances.

 The booklet, Australian Citizenship Ceremonies - a Handbook for Local Government, was released in January 1998 to provide guidelines to local councils on how citizenship ceremonies should be conducted.

 50th anniversary

 Australian citizenship reached a 50-year milestone on 26 January 1999. Celebrations and activities were developed over a twelve month period to encourage all Australians to take pride in their citizenship and encourage eligible permanent residents to take out Australian citizenship.

 Celebrations were inclusive for all Australian citizens and encouraged full participation by the Australian community through understanding of the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship and shared values.

 Australian Citizenship Council

 In August 1998, the Minister announced the establishment of the Australian Citizenship Council, under the chair of the former Governor General, Sir Ninian Stephen, to report to the Government on issues relating to Australian Citizenship policy and law.

 The Council obtained a broad spectrum of community views, which were considered in its deliberations. The report, Australian Citizenship for a New Century was launched in February 2000 and is available on the internet at: 

 http://www.citizenship.gov.au

 Government Response to Report

 In May 2001, the Minister launched the Government response to the Australian Citizenship Council’s report Australian Citizenship….A Common Bond. In its response, the Government agreed that no changes would be made to the basic criteria for the grant of Australian citizenship. 

 The Government also agreed to legislate to extend the decent and resumption provisions to give young people more opportunity to acquire Australian citizenship, provide for children to receive their own citizenship certificate and to strengthen aspects of the integrity of the Australian citizenship process.  

 In addition, section 17 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 would be repealed so that in future, adult Australians do not lose their Australian citizenship on the acquisition of another.  Legislation on this is still to go through Parliament.

 The Government’s response is available on the Internet at:  http://www.citizenship.gov.au

 Citizenship Day

 On 17 September 2001 the first annual Australian Citizenship Day was celebrated. It was marked by a program of activities that were held across the country. These included special Citizenship Ceremonies and affirmation ceremonies for people who are already Australian Citizens.

 17 September was chosen to coincide with the renaming of the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1949 to the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 on 17 September 1973.

 Citizenship Day was the culmination of a national campaign to encourage permanent residents who had been living in Australia for more than two years to apply for citizenship.  The campaign was launched by the Minister on 1 July 2001.

 The response to the campaign was positive, with a 53 per cent increase in the number of applicants for Australian citizenship over the period 1 July to end September 2001, compared with the same period in 2000.

 Information on Australian Citizenship Day is available on the internet at: 

 http://www.citizenship.gov.au
