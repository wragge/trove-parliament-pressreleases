 Baxter Immigration Detention Centre to close 

 Friday, 17th August 2007 

 The Australian Government today announced it will close the Baxter  Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) and return the facility to the Department  of Defence. 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Kevin Andrews said the decision  to close Baxter as a detention centre was able to be made because the  government’s strong border protection policies, particularly the use of the  offshore processing facility on Nauru, had successfully stemmed the flow of  illegal boat arrivals.   

 'Stemming the flow of illegal arrivals has been a key part of the measures to  make Australia’s borders secure and assure the integrity of its immigration  programme,' Mr Andrews said. 

 In addition to the Department of Defence utilising the facility, the Department  of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs will utilise the  demountable buildings, which would be relocated to identified Indigenous  communities to support the government’s emergency response for the  protection of Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory. 

 Mr Andrews said the facilities from Baxter were a critical element in the  implementation of the emergency response as there was a shortage of  temporary accommodation for the additional government staff and services  which will operate at the affected Indigenous communities. 

 'I am very pleased that the Baxter buildings can be put to good use in support  of the government’s commitment to the protection Aboriginal children in the  Northern Territory,' Mr Andrews added.
