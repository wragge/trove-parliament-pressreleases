Advice and Rights Centre

  Topic - “Recent Changes to I  mmigration Law - Changes to the Administrative Review Scheme”

  

  Introduction

  

  I would like to thank the Victorian Immigration Advice and Rights 
Centre for the invitation to open this conference. I warmly welcome 
the opportunity to speak on the important topic of proposed changes 
to administrative review, in the context of immigration decision-making.

  

  In our Law and Justice policy statement issued in February 1996, the 
Coalition affirmed its commitment to the principles of administrative 
law generally. That statement said:

  

  administrative law exists 
to enhance administrative justice. it is a crucial means by which the 
government and the bureaucracy are directly accountable to individuals 
affected by their actions.

  

  We are determined to review and improve the   administrative law system.

  

  However, at the outset, I would like to make one point absolutely 
clear. This Government believes that people are entitled to a fair hearing. 
Visa applicants will get a fair hearing from my Department in the first 
instance. In addition, a person refused at first instance and who is 
in Australia, or who is sponsored by an Australian, has the right to 
merits review.

  

  However, we believe it is important to have a system that is also 
fair to the people who fund it - the Australian taxpayer. In other words, 
we believe in a system that operates in the public interest - a fair 
system, but one that is efficient.

  

  The notion of “public interest” includes the concern to ensure 
that high quality primary administrative decisions are made and continue 
to be made, as a matter of routine in a cost-effective and timely manner, 
and ensuring aggrieved persons have access to prompt and economical 
external review mechanisms.

  

  I emphasise that this Government is determined to reduce escalating 
costs and delays, particularly in relation to merits and judicial review 
of migration decisions. By doing so, we are acting in the public interest.

  

  The tribunals and courts may well see their role to defend the rights 
of individual applicants, and I do not dispute that tribunals and courts 
do need to have regard to the rights of individual applicants. However 
those considerations must not be at the expense of the wishes of Parliament 
as expressed in the migration legislation nor at the expense of wider 
community interests.

  

  The legislation not only establishes those rights, by setting out 
in clear legislative form the grounds on which an applicant may be granted 
a visa, but balances them against budgetary and other wider community 
interests.

  

  Before moving on to migration specific changes, we should note that 
in March of this year, the Government announced the amalgamation of 
the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, 
the Immigration Review Tribunal (IRT), and the Refugee Review Tribunal 
(RRT) to form a new Administrative Review Tribunal (ART). The ART will 
consist of a number of divisions, broadly reflecting the current individual 
Tribunals.

  

  While many of the implementation issues are still to be resolved, 
it is envisaged that the ART will contain separate divisions which would 
each develop and maintain flexible, cost-effective and non-legalistic 
procedures relevant to their jurisdictions. That is, the revamped immigration 
and refugee review processes will be retained by a discrete division 
within the new tribunal. The ART will remain independent of the Departments 
whose decisions it reviews.

  

  Today, I wish to talk to you, in particular, about the changes proposed 
to the merits review system in the immigration portfolio, and judicial 
review of migration decisions. Those changes are contained in   Migration Legislation Amendment Bills (nos. 4 
and 5)  respectively, which are currently awaiting debate in the 
Senate.

  

  On 21 March 1998, the   Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) 
Act 1997   
commenced. I have appointed the Migration Institute of Australia (MIA) 
as the Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA). The MARA is undertaking 
the range of functions previously carried out by the former Migration 
Agents Registration Board. I do not intend to speak further on this 
matter, as I note the next speaker will be giving a detailed address 
on the new scheme for the regulation of Migration Agents.

  

  To enable you to more fully understand the rationale behind the proposed 
changes to merits and judicial review of migration decisions, I would 
like to outline the Government’s concerns about the system existing 
at the time it came to office.

  

  Merits Review

  

  My primary concerns with the IRT and the RRT are firstly, the length 
of time taken by the determination process and secondly, the potential 
for the Government’s policy decisions to be distorted in the review 
process.

  

  One intention in establishing the tribunals was that they would reduce 
the need for judicial review. However, since their introduction, the 
length of the determination process has increased appreciably. Furthermore, 
decisions are now frequently reviewed by the tribunals and by the courts. 
In some cases this can result in five tiers of review. Obviously, this 
situation needed to be addressed.

  

  When the Government came to office, the onshore application rate was 
increasing. The number of Protection Visa applications had increased 
from around 500 per annum in the 1980s to around 11,000 per annum. Many 
of these applications are from nationals of countries where there is 
little or no persecution, such as Fiji, Tonga, the Philippines, Canada 
and Ireland. Significant numbers of visitors were also abusing the Protection 
Visa system in order to prolong their stay, obtain work rights and access 
to Medicare, or, if in hardship, receive financial assistance.

  

  I acknowledge the positive contribution that the tribunals, their 
members and their work have made to migration in Australia. I am concerned, 
however, that there has been a shift away from the original framework 
of the tribunals and about the potential distortion of the Government’s 
policy decisions as embodied in the migration legislation and in policy 
documents.

  

  Whilst tribunals are meant to be independent decision-making bodies 
and it is the role of the members of those tribunals to be impartial 
and free from bias, it is not the role of the tribunals to determine 
migration policy. That is the role of the government of the day. Consequently, 
tribunals should be aware of and act on policy as it is expressed in 
the migration legislation and give due weight to supporting policy guidelines.

  

  Changes to Merits Review

  

  Responding to these concerns and in line with our pre-election policy 
commitment, the Coalition has reviewed migration decision making with 
particular attention paid to the role and performance of the IRT and 
the RRT.

  

  The   Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (no.4) 1997  (MLAB No.4) 
was passed by the House of Representatives on 3 September 1997, and 
is currently awaiting debate in the Senate.

  

  The major change set out in this Bill is to merge the current three 
portfolio review bodies into two review tribunals. As you may be aware, 
currently protection visa applications are processed in a two-tier decision-making 
structure. Primary decisions are made by my department and, if unsuccessful, 
an applicant can seek review before the RRT.

  

  In non-refugee cases, most other migration applications have a three 
tier merits assessment process, with a primary decision by my Department, 
a Departmental review by the Migration Internal Review Office or “MIRO”, 
and an independent review by the IRT.

  

  The proposed changes will bring all migration processing into line 
so that there is a two-tier merits assessment of applications in all 
review cases. This will be done by merging MIRO with the independent 
IRT, while the RRT will remain a separate body dealing exclusively with 
review of Protection Visa applications.

  

  I should emphasise that no existing rights of review will be lost 
- a person who has a right of review before MIRO or the IRT at the time 
these bodies are merged will retain a right of review before the new 
Migration Review Tribunal (MRT).

  

  The changes will also give the Principal Member 
of the RRT and the new MRT the power to make directions with regard 
to efficient processing procedures. Such directions will be given for 
the purpose of speeding up the review process and ensuring that appli  cants are given a quick 
decision on their application. The Members of the Tribunals will be 
bound to comply with such directions. The Principal Member will not 
have the power to direct a particular outcome in any case, and, as I 
stated in Parliament, the Principal Member will not have any power to 
give policy directions.

  

  In particular, the Principal Member of the Tribunal will have the 
power to reconstitute the Tribunal in order to increase the efficiency 
of processing. Some concerns were raised in initial consultations that 
such powers could be used to influence the outcome of cases. In response, 
the Bill now requires the Principal Member to consult with the Member 
or Members constituting the Tribunal, and a Senior Member of the Tribunal, 
before a reconstitution direction can be made.

  

  Following these consultations, the Principal Member will be able to 
make a reconstitution direction only if he or she is satisfied that 
there is insufficient material presently before the Tribunal for it 
to make a decision, or if a prescribed time has elapsed since the Tribunal 
was constituted for that review.

  

  The reconstitution power is expected to be used rarely. The very existence 
of this power is expected to increase the efficiency of reviews undertaken 
by the Tribunals.

  

  Another change to the system of administrative review will be to introduce 
a “Code of Procedure” for the Tribunals. The Act, primarily Part 
2, Division 3, Subdivision AB, already includes such a code for the 
handling of primary decisions. This requires the decision-maker, for 
example, to consider all information forwarded by the applicant, allow 
the applicant to respond to adverse information, not make a decision 
before a response has been received (or a specified time period expires), 
and so on. The Code of Procedure replaces the somewhat uncertain requirements 
to accord procedural fairness with definite procedural steps which broadly 
equate to the common law requirements. It must be remembered that the 
Code establishes a minimum requirement - there may be circumstances 
where it is considered appropriate to provide, for example, more information 
or additional time, than is strictly required by the code.

  

  A similar code at the Tribunal level will give the Tribunals a clearer 
idea of the procedures that must be carried out to make a lawful and 
fair decision. This will also assist to eliminate the confusion surrounding 
the current construction of s.476 (1)(a) of the Act, which provides 
that a failure by the Tribunals to follow a “procedure” which the 
Act requires to be followed is a valid ground of judicial review.

  

  In addition, Tribunal Members are to be given greater discretion over 
the way in which hearings are conducted and publication of decisions. 
However, all applicants for review who wish to have a hearing will continue 
to have this right. An applicant will be invited to appear before the 
Tribunal for a hearing unless:

  

  * a decision favourable to the applicant may be made on the papers; 
or

  

  * the applicant consents to the Tribunal proceeding without a hearing; 
or

  

  * the applicant fails to respond to the Tribunal’s invitation to 
provide additional material or comments.

  

  A number of other legislative and administrative 
measures have already been introduced, by means of amendments to the 
Migration Regulations  , to improve performance and reduce the scope for abuse.

  

  To shorten overall processing times and to discourage frivolous applications 
there have been put in place greater restrictions on work rights, review 
application periods and a change in the structure of the review application 
fee. For example:

  

  * Only applicants who apply for a Protection Visa within 45 days of 
arriving in Australia can be granted a bridging visa with full work 
rights and access to Medicare.

  

  * The time allowed to seek review of a no  n-Protection Visa decision has been reduced from 28 to 21 days after 
notification of the primary decision.

  

  * A significant measure has been to impose a post-decision application 
fee of $1000 for the RRT. This will not put an obstacle in the path 
of bona fide refugees, but to act as a deterrent for people intent on 
abusing the system. The $1000 fee is only paya  ble after a review decision has been made and is not imposed if the 
RRT finds that the applicant is a refugee. The fee is substantially 
less than the full processing cost and is not a fine.

  

  There are already clear indications that these 
measures are havin  g the desired effect, with processing times having been reduced dramatically. 
Application rates also appear to be declining. Through firm and decisive 
steps we have been able to bring under control a process that was out 
of control and thus restore integrity to Australia’s onshore refugee 
determination system.

  

  Amendments will also be made to section 499 of the Act by the   Migration 
Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions Relating to Character 
and Conduct) Bill 1997 , which was passed by the House of Representatives 
on 19 November 1997, and is currently awaiting debate in the Senate. 
Those amendments will allow me to give precise written directions in 
relation to the exercise of discretions and to give specific rather 
than general directions. However, those directions will not be able 
to be inconsistent with the Act or Regulations.

  

  The result of all these changes is that not only will people with 
bona fide applications be given a decision more quickly, but those intent 
on fraud, deception or delay will not have the benefits of a delayed 
decision. The anticipated benefits of these changes include the following:

  

  * The MRT is expected to be able to complete most reviews in at least 
half the time currently taken by MIRO and the IRT - down from an averag  e of 16 months in 1996-97 
to no more than 6 to 8 months.

  

  * The RRT’s productivity will also be improved, allowing it to reduce 
its backlog of cases, and reduce its average review time, which currently 
stands at 9-10 days for non-detention cases, still fur  ther.

  

  * In the longer term, these changes will provide savings of approximately 
$1 million per annum from the year 2000 onwards.

  

  The Senate’s Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Committee reported on Bill no.4 on 30 October last year. The Majority 
Report re  commended 
that the Bill be passed unamended. However, the Minority report called 
for a number of the measures in the Bill to be opposed.

  

  One sensible measure opposed in the Minority Report, is a provision 
for hearings to be conducted by video conferencing in certain circumstances. 
As you would be aware, this is an accepted practice, widely used in 
Australia including in the High Court. It also opposes some of the other 
initiatives that I have already canvassed, such as the ability to reconstitute 
cases.

  

  Should the Opposition’s move to amend this Bill, the Government’s 
ability to achieve efficient outcomes from the decision making process 
will be severely inhibited.

  

  In the interest of taxpayers and genuine applicants, tribunal procedures 
need to be fair, just, economical, informal and quick.

  

  Unfortunately in the past, insufficient attention has been paid to 
ensuring that review procedures were quick and efficient. If anyone 
doubts that reforms such as those set out in MLAB No.4 are needed, let 
me remind you that at the moment the fastest 25% of cases in the Immigration 
Review Tribunal take an average of 75 days and the slowest 25% take 
589 days. The longest decision on record from the IRT took 2073 days!

  

  With this legislation, the Government aims to reduce this time considerably.

  

  While the slowest 25% of decisions include cases in which the IRT 
must rely on advice from other agencies, such as skills and medical 
assessments, these legislative reforms will make a significant contribution 
to reducing review times.

  

  Delays in processing not only add to the expense of operating the 
Tribunals. In relation to protection claims, the community bears added 
costs because applicants have access to Medicare, access to employment 
and in some cases, Asylum Seekers Assistance.

  

  The Tribunals have been slow, costly and cumbersome, 
costing in excess of $21 million in taxpayers’ money in 1996-97.

  

  Although there have been some improvements, 
we have done all we can within the constraints of current legislation. 
Further changes are n  eeded to further improve efficiencies and processing times.

  

  Those opposing the changes announced by the 
Government should also be aware that there is not only a dollar cost 
with such delays. There is a moral cost.

  

  Immigration is probably the only area of   administrative law 
where delaying a final determination is beneficial to the applicant, 
as they remain in Australia while the case is being processed. Delay 
is therefore an end in itself.

  

  While excessive delays may help non bona fide applicants, it disadvantages 
those who are genuine. For example, it could mean unacceptable delays 
in providing counselling services to bona fide refugees whose application 
has been caught in a backlog.

  

  If the Government has the tools to speed up the process, bona fide 
applicants will get a decision more quickly.

  

  Judicial Review

  

  In implementing the proposed changes to merits review of migration 
and refugee decisions, applicants will continue to have access to a 
thorough independent merits assessment of their case. The current system 
of having internal and external merits review, together with access 
to the Federal and High courts gives applicants up to five levels of 
review, if a case is appealed against all the way to the High Court.

  

  At the end of the process the applicant is still able to access my 
ministerial discretion.

  

  The Government’s pre-election policy commitment was that, given 
the extensive merits review rights in the migration legislation, we 
would restrict access to judicial review in all but exceptional circumstances.

  

  That commitment arose from concerns about the growing cost and incidence 
of litigation of migration and refugee matters, as well as the delays 
associated with such litigation.

  

  Much of the growth in applications for judicial review has come from 
the refugee area. I see this high level of litigation, particularly 
by onshore asylum seekers, as highly undesirable given the associated 
costs and delays, and for those in detention, significantly longer periods 
of detention.

  

  As I have already stated, Immigration is probably the only area of 
administrative law where delaying a final determination is beneficial 
to the applicant, as they remain in Australia while the case is being 
processed.

  

  Under our humanitarian program Australia has an outstanding record 
in fulfilling its international humanitarian obligations by resettling 
refugee and humanitarian entrants within our borders.

  

  But our ability is finite. It is essential that, in the context of 
specific funding in the budget for humanitarian entrants for a limited 
number of places, these places go to persons genuinely in need of Australia’s 
protection.

  

  It is my intention that bona fide applicants will be accepted. I do 
not intend to see refugees refouled and I expect my Department and the 
Refugee Review Tribunal to discharge this responsibility.

  

  But I am concerned about abuse of the onshore refugee/asylum application 
process.

  

  I have particular concerns in relation to those who travel to Australia 
on a visitor visa, with the necessary documents issued by their own 
government to travel here, and who seek to claim refugee status in Australia 
merely to enable them to access work rights or access to Medicare. Those 
people have been able to delay their removal not only by availing themselves 
of merits review but by the judicial review process as well.

  

  Since 1 July 1993, when the RRT commenced operations, there have been 
14,444 decisions taken by my Department to refuse refugee status that 
have been affirmed by the Refugee Review Tribunal. 1286 of these applicants 
have appealed to the Federal Court. 179 were sent back to the Tribunal 
for reconsideration and this resulted in 29 favourable decisions - only 
29 decisions over a period of just under five years.

  

  This result comes at enormous cost to the taxpayer. My non-compellable 
Ministerial discretion is far less expensive and I am also able to address 
the full merits of the particular case, which is a far wider power than 
the role of the courts in judicial review.

  

  The assumption from these figures is that while 
there are genuine applications, most applications are simply not bona 
fide.

  

  The abuse cost taxpayers millions of dollars, 
undermines public trust and disadvantages genuine applicants.

  

  You will probably be   aware that the   Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (no.5) 1997  
(MLAB No.5) was passed by the House of Representatives on 24 September 
1997. This Bill will omit the existing judicial review provisions of 
the Act, set out in Part 8, and replace them with a “privative clause”. 
The new Section 474 is expressed to broadly oust the jurisdiction of 
all Australian courts. The effect of this section will be discussed 
shortly. As mentioned, this Bill is also currently awaiting debate in 
the Senate.

  

  The changes to the merits and judicial review systems will make our 
protection visa processing arrangements substantially more streamlined 
and cost-effective. I consider this is the best way of ensuring that 
genuine applicants receive protection quickly and to reduce the incentive 
for those seeking to abuse the system.

  

  Tendencies to exploit every avenue of appeal and to push every aspect 
of flexibility to breaking point leaves the Government reluctant to 
provide mechanisms to address special circumstances so as to ensure 
the outcomes of its migration programme. Those who exploit the system 
do a disservice to those in greater need by forcing the Government to 
more restrictive approaches to ensure control of the programme.

  

  In also understanding why the Government has 
decide  d 
to enact a privative clause, it is useful to consider in more detail 
the history of attempts by previous governments to limit judicial review.

  

  Such attempts have not been effective.

  

  In fact applications for judicial review have increased in number 
since the Migration Reform Act was passed, and continue to trend upwards

  

  -378cases in 1994-5,

  -630 in 1995-6,

  -640 in 1996-7

  -658 so far in 1997-8

  

  Migration matters now make up 65% of the Federal 
Court’s administrative law caseload. There is also evidence th  at delays associated 
with litigation are also growing

  

  * the average number of days between the date of application and judicial 
decision is now 337 for   refugee   cases

  

  as compared with 107 days in 1993-4, and

  

  * 288 for   non-refugee   cases as compared with 259 days in 1993-4.

  

  Further, in 227 of the applications for judicial review filed this 
year, the applicant has been unrepresented. The applicant withdrew prior 
to hearing in 88 of those cases, or 39% of the applications. The Department 
won 105 of those cases, or 46%. That is, in

  85% of cases in which the applicant is unrepresented, the applicant 
either withdraws before judgment or the Department is successful. This 
indicates that very few applicants have a meritorious case to put to 
the court, and are using the judicial review system in an effort to 
delay their removal from Australia.

  

  While I applaud the efforts that are being made by the Federal Court 
in Melbourne and Sydney to introduce new practices to expedite judicial 
review of migration cases, I believe that the trend in rising applications 
will continue to the extent that the court will simply not be able to 
deal with them.

  

  The use of a privative clause has been criticised but it is merely 
a further attempt to contain judicial review after measures introduced 
by the previous government have proved unsuccessful. In this regard, 
it is useful to look at the decision-making powers under the   Migration Act  and major changes to that 
legislation since 1989.

  

  

  The pre-December 1989 Act

  

  The pre-December 1989 Act provided for very broad general discretions 
to grant and refuse visas and entry permits to applicants. These broad 
provisions were supplemented by departmental manuals that set out government 
policy and provided decision-makers with instructions on how to make 
decisions.

  

  After substantial criticism by such bodies as the Administrative Review 
Council, Human Rights Commission (as it was then), the Committee to 
Advise on Australia’s Immigration Policies (CAAIP) ¹ as well as the 
Courts, that these provisions were too vague and did not set out the 
basis on which a person would be granted a visa, the legislation was 
significantly changed. In 1989 the Government at that time amended the   Migration 
Act  to provide for a system of entitlements to visas and entry 
permits where an applicant met the criteria spelt out in regulations 
made under the Act. The policy manuals were replaced by the   Migration Regulations , which for the first 
time set out the criteria for a visa or entry permit in legislative 
form, thus providing a fairer and more certain system for both applicants 
and decision-makers.

  

  The 1989 amendments to the Act also provided, 
for the first time, a statutory merits review procedure for most migration 
decisions, by the Migration Internal Review Office (MIRO) and the Immigration 
Review Tribunal (IRT).

  

  It was envisaged that by removin  g the broad discretion 
of decision-makers, and replacing it with codified criteria for grant 
of visas, in conjunction with statutory merits review of certain decisions, 
that recourse to judicial review would be less necessary. This did not 
prove to be the case. In the early 1980s the Federal Court received 
only about 30 applications for review of migration decisions each year. 
By the end of that decade this had increased to about 100 applications 
each year, and by 1992 it was almost 200 per year.

  

  The Migration Reform Act 1992

  

  The   Migration Reform Act  made further significant amendments affecting 
both merits and judicial review. The most important features of this 
reform were:

  

  * The introduction of a detailed statutory code of procedures for most 
primary d  ecisions, 
setting minimum standards for dealing with a visa application.

  

  * Replacement of the judicial review scheme under the   Administrative Decisions   (Judicial Review) Act  as well as s.39B of the   Judiciary Act  with a Migration Act specific 
judicial review scheme, which removed certain grounds of review such 
as the grounds of natural justice and unreasonableness.

  

  * The extension of merits review to many decisions previously not covered 
by merits review - most significantly, the creation of the Refugee Re  view Tribunal (RRT) 
to provide merits review of refugee determinations.

  

  The aim of these amendments was to provide 
a system that was for both decision-makers and applicants fairer and 
more certain. It was also intended to increase the accountability of 
de  cision-makers 
as well as providing clarity for all on how applications would be dealt 
with.

  

  It is useful to re-emphasise the previous Government’s expressed 
intentions in making these amendments. In his second reading speech 
the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, 
said this:

  

  “Under the reforms, decision 
making procedures will be codified. This will provide a fair and certain 
process with which both applicant and decision-maker can be confident. 
Decision-makers will be able to   focus on the merits of each case knowing precisely 
what procedural requirements are to be followed. These procedures will 
replace the somewhat open ended doctrines of natural justice and unreasonableness.”

  

  The most important feature of the reform in 
so fa  r as 
it related to judicial review was the removal of the common law grounds 
for challenging decisions, on the basis of a breach of the rules of 
natural justice and unreasonableness. Part 8 of the   Migration Act,  after the MRA and currently, 
sets out the means and the grounds for the challenge to visa eligibility 
and cancellation decisions, and is the sole source of Federal Court 
jurisdiction in migration matters. However, the High Court retains its 
original jurisdiction to review decisions under the Constitution.

  

  Section 475 provides that only certain decisions are judicially reviewable 
under the scheme. These are decisions of the IRT and the RRT, as well 
as any decisions relating to visas which are non-merits reviewable. 
This was designed to ensure that applicants with merits review rights 
exercised those rights prior to seeking judicial review.

  

  Section 476 sets out the grounds for challenge. These are the   only  
grounds on which a decision under the Act can be challenged in the Federal 
Court, and codify existing common law grounds of review. It is this 
section that removes the common law grounds of review of natural justice 
and   Wednesbury  unreasonableness from review by the Federal Court.

  

  Common law natural justice has been replaced with the ground that 
procedures required by the Act were not followed. Critical to this ground 
is the prescription in the Act and regulations of a code of procedures 
to replace the common law principles of procedural fairness. As mentioned 
earlier, the procedures contained in sections 44 to 140 of the   Migration 
Act  now set out the procedural standards for the grant and refusal 
of visas, consideration of an application for a visa and cancellation 
of a visa.

  

  Provisions setting out the code of procedure, 
in conjunction with the disclosure provisions and merits review, would, 
the former Government believed, provide effective and comprehensive 
protection of the applicant’s interests as well as providing decision   makers with a standardised 
framework within which to operate. Again it was envisaged that with 
increased merits review, a more certain procedural framework, and reduced 
grounds of judicial review, there would be less need for applicants 
to seek judicial review, and less actual applications.

  

  Interpretation of Part 8

  

  As discussed, the hope that increased merits review, in conjunction 
with more certain procedures and reduced grounds for judicial review, 
would decrease the number of applications for judicial review has not 
been fulfilled. Applications for judicial review of migration matters 
have increased to over 900 in 1997.

  

  Further, all has not turned out as expected with respect to the operation 
of Part 8, as the Federal Court has found the means to incorporate common 
law grounds of review back into decisions of the Tribunals. This is 
despite the clear intentions of the Act. The means for doing this is 
via certain provisions, which were inserted into the Act with the 1989 
and 1992 reforms (creating the merits review tribunals).

  

  The most significant of these are sections 353 and 420 of the Act. 
These provisions require that the IRT and RRT respectively are to act 
according to “substantial justice and the merits of the case” when 
conducting their functions.

  

  Since the introduction of Part 8, a large number of refugee-related 
cases have examined whether the requirement to provide “substantial 
justice” is a procedure which must be observed for the purposes of 
the Act. The argument has been that the “substantial justice” provision 
effectively requires that the RRT observe procedural fairness in making 
its decisions. This is despite the fact that the Act specifically excludes 
“natural justice” as a ground of review.

  

  The Explanatory Memorandum for the   Migration Reform Act  states the following 
in relation to s.420 (then s.166C):

  

  “Substantial justice” is used to emphasise 
that it is the issues raised by the case, rather than the processes 
of deciding it, which should guide the RRT in making its decisions. 
It is int  ended 
that the RRT will operate in an informal non-adversarial way that will 
facilitate applicants putting their own case in their own words.

  

  In other words, s.420 was intended to   
remove   RRT 
and judicial attention from processes, and ensure that the RRT focuses 
on the merits of the case, allowing the applicant to tell their story. 
It was certainly not intended that s.420 be used as a “back door” 
method of requiring that procedural fairness be observed by the RRT.

  

  Until the decision of the full federal court in   Eshetu v MIMA  2 , judicial authority 
on the matter was nearly evenly split, perhaps with a slight majority 
of federal court authority favouring the position that provision of 
substantial justice was not a “procedure” for the purposes of the 
Act. The Full Federal Court in   Eshetu  appears to have found that this 
is such a “procedure”, and found that the RRT had denied substantial 
justice to the applicant. Some later Federal Court cases have accepted   Eshetu  
as being authoritative on this issue, but there has been significant 
division on the issue.   Eshetu  itself was a split decision, and 
the divisions in the Federal Court were also clearly shown in the decision 
in   Sun Zhan Qui v MIMA  3 , in which the court again split 
on the issue of the interpretation of s.420.

  

  The case of   Amarjit Singh v MIMA  4  
also extended the operation of s.420 to instances of apprehended bias, 
and found that in the case of an applicant with a second application 
before the RRT, “substantial justice” required that the RRT for 
the second hearing be constituted by a different Member. This decision 
was made despite the fact that the Act removes the ground of apprehended 
bias from judicial review, replacing it with actual bias, which was 
not alleged against the Member who heard both cases.

  

  Thambythurai v MIMA   5  may have expanded the scope of these provisions even 
further. Justice Finkelstein confirmed the position that provision of 
substantial justice is a “procedure” for the purposes of the Act. 
Regarding the content of “substantial justice”, His Honour preferred 
the view that it imposes only one obligation, and that is “an obligation 
to act in a manner Justice Deane in   Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v  Bond   6   referred to as ‘acting judicially’.” The exact extent of this 
duty would vary from case to case, but it would normally include:

  

  * the absence of actual or apprehended bias

  

  * according an appropriate opportunity to be 
heard

  

  * regard be paid to material considerations and immaterial or irrelevant 
considerations be ignored - despite the fact that this ground is also 
excluded by the   Act

  

  * decisions be made on the basis of logically probative evidence - 
despite the fact that this ground is limited by the Act.

  

  

  The High Court granted special leave to appeal 
against the decision in   Eshetu   on 13 March 1998. The matter is expected to be heard in the second 
half of this year.

  

  I believe that, particularly with the Federal Court’s adoption of 
this line of reasoning, there is room for the proposition that some 
form of merits review is going on under the disguise of judicial review.

  

  Judicial review should not be a word-by-word examination of the reasons 
given by the original decision-maker or the Tribunal in a search for 
legal errors. But I am not the only one of that view. Let me quote to 
you what the High Court said in a migration case,   MIEA v Wu Shan Liang  7 :

  

  …the reasons of an administrative decision-maker 
are meant to inform and are not to be scrutinised upon over-zealous 
judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be 
gleaned from the way in which the reasons are ex  pressed.

  

  Indeed, in the application for special leave 
to appeal in the High Court against the decision in   Eshetu  , Justice Gaudron had cause to recall what was said in Wu Shan Liang. 
Justice Gummow immediately commented that maybe what was said in that 
case had to be said again.

  

  In summary, the current position is that the reforms made by the MRA 
and the restrictions upon judicial review contained in Part 8 of the 
Act have not been effective in reducing judicial review. In addition, 
the common law grounds of review Part 8 sought to exclude as grounds 
of review of migration decisions are being given new life, but in the 
guise of the allowable grounds of review under Part 8.

  

  The Privative Clause

  

  In an environment of increased costs and delay, and reported abuse 
of the system, I asked my Department to explore options, in conjunction 
with the Attorney-General’s Department, the Department of Prime Minister 
and Cabinet and eminent legal counsel, for best achieving the Government’s 
policy objective of restricting access to judicial review. The advice 
I received from legal counsel was that the only workable option was 
a privative clause.

  

  As you would know section 75 of the Commonwealth Constitution gives 
the High Court original jurisdiction to consider challenges to the actions 
and decisions of Commonwealth officers, access to the High Court cannot 
be legislatively restricted without a Constitutional amendment.

  

  While both access to, and the scope of judicial review by, the Federal 
Court can be changed by legislation, to simply restrict access to the 
Federal Court in migration legislation matters would in practice deflect 
many cases to the High Court under section 75 of the Constitution. Counsels’ 
advice was that a privative clause would have the effect of narrowing 
the scope of judicial review by the High Court, and of course the Federal 
Court. That advice was largely based on the High Court’s own interpretation 
of such clauses in cases such as   Hickman’s case  8 , as long ago 
as 1945, but more recently in the   Richard Walter case  9  
in 1995, and the   Darling Casino Case  10  
in April 1997.

  

  The judgement of Justice Dixon in the   Hickman case  is authority for the proposition 
that privative clauses such as that to be inserted into the Migration 
Act will protect decisions from being set aside, so long as:

  

  * It is a bona fide exercise of power by the decision-maker

  

  * The decision relates to the subject matter of the enabling legislation

  

  * It is within constitutional power.

  

  In other words, the effect of a privative clause such as that used 
in Hickman’s case is to expand the legal validity of the acts done 
and the decisions made by decision-makers. In practical terms it narrows 
the scope of judicial review to that of narrow jurisdictional error 
and   male fides . The options available to the Government were very 
much shaped by the Constitution. While I accept that the precise limits 
of privative clauses may need examination by the High Court, there was 
no other practical option open to the Government to achieve its policy 
objective.

  

  It is useful to note and address some of the 
objections to the privative clause raised by legal practitioners and 
academics during the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee hearings, 
dealing with Bill no 5.

  

  It was suggested that the privative clause   is unconstitutional 
and possibly in breach of the separation of powers required by the Constitution. 
My Department obtained extensive and detailed advice on this matter, 
and all the advice received from eminent legal practitioners made no 
suggestion that the privative clause was unconstitutional, or that it 
would offend the important principle of the separation of powers.

  

  It was suggested to the Senate Committee that a leave requirement 
would achieve the Government’s aims of restricting judicial review 
to “exceptional circumstances” and remove unmeritorious cases at 
an early stage. However, while the Government does have the power to 
place a leave requirement on the Federal Court, it does not have this 
power with respect to the High Court. It could also effectively double 
the number of hearings before the Federal Court, thus increasing costs 
and delay. On this basis, a leave provision was not viewed as a viable 
option.

  

  The risk that a genuine refugee could be refouled 
without access to judicial review was a  lso raised. However, the Government considers that any increased risk 
is minimal. It is considered that the RRT will act knowing that it is 
the last level of review and decide the applicant’s case accordingly. 
I will also retain my special power to intervene and grant a visa where 
the public interest warrants this step.

  

  The report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee 
on MLAB no.5 was also handed down on 30 October. The Majority report 
recommended that the Bill be passed without amendment, while the Minority 
recommended that the Bill be withdrawn altogether. I emphasise once 
again that the privative clause is the only means by which the ever-increasing 
costs of and delays in litigation of migration matters can be decreased, 
and abuse of the system of judicial review prevented.

  

  Conclusion

  

  In conclusion, I want to assure you that the changes to the review 
process announced by the Government will re-establish credibility, integrity 
and confidence in the wider migration programme, without compromising 
immigrant justice. These measures are intended to complement other administrative 
and legislative measures to achieve efficiencies in primary decision-making.

  

  Under the proposed new regime, aggrieved applicants will continue 
to have access to external merits review through the MRT and the RRT.

  

  Although the privative clause will limit the scope of judicial review, 
it will not prevent access to either the Federal Court or the High Court. 
In any case, our changes will help fulfil the original intention in 
establishing the tribunals in that they will reduce the need for judicial 
review. The consequence of these changes, especially in shortening overall 
processing times and discouraging frivolous applications for review 
will, I believe, increase justice by permitting the genuine applicant 
to receive a speedy resolution of their situation.

  

  In my view the key challenge to the administrative law system and 
its practitioners, lies in not focussing on particular aspects of the 
system in isolation from the wider system, of which they are a part. 
The rule of law requires that there needs to be an on-going process 
of properly balancing the interests of individuals with the interests 
of the wider community, and it is the belief of the Government that 
these reforms go a long way towards meeting that goal.
