 MEDIA RELEASE    

 

 Friday 12 June 2015    

 

 The Prime Minister must come clean on trafficking allegations     

 

 The Australian Greens say that that the Government must come clean on whether  payments were made to boat crews to turn asylum seekers back to Indonesia and whether  Government officials have acted illegally.     

 "These are very serious allegations and the Government must come clean. The public has  a right to know if the Abbott Government has participated in people trafficking or not,"  Greens spokesperson for Immigration Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 "The Prime Minister has all but admitted that the Government is prepared to do anything  out on the high seas, even it seems if that means breaking the law or participating in  people trafficking.     

 “The Government either condones this behaviour or it doesn't. The fact that the  Prime  Minister and his minister can't provide a straight answer speaks volumes.     

 "Payments to individuals to turn a boat around and take asylum seekers to Indonesia may  be highly illegal. The trafficking of people against their will is a serious crime. The  Australian government must give a full and accurate account of what has occurred.    

 “Once again the governments cloak of secrecy in relation to its border protection  operations throws into question what is really going on with its asylum seeker policies    

 “Indonesia has every right to be shocked by these claims and the government should  order an immediate and transparent investigation into them to save its credibility
