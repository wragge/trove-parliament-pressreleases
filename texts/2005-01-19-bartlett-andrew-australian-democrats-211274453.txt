 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 05/013 WEDNESDAY 19 JANUARY 2005   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS SPOKESPERSON ON IMMIGRATION  WRITER MAY FACE FORCED DEPORTATION TO IRAN  The Australian Democrats have supported the concerns of the Writers in Prison Committee of International (PEN), about the possible deportation from Australia of an Iranian writer, given the appalling lack of freedom of expression in Iran. Democrat spokesperson for Immigration Senator Andrew Bartlett said, “There are grave concerns that Iranian writer Ardeshir Gholipour, who is detained at Baxter Detention Centre, could be forcibly deported. “According to PEN’s records, there are at least 13 writers currently detained in Iran, serving lengthy sentences for reasons which have been condemned internationally as clear breaches of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. “Mr Gholipour’s case has been thoroughly investigated by PEN who believe that he has real reason to fear persecution should he be returned to Iran.  “It would be negligence on Australia’s part to forcible repatriate Mr Gholipour. “In Australia we value freedom of speech and if an Australian writer was jailed for their ideas we would be marching in the streets. “I am alarmed by the prospect of Mr Gholipour’s forced return and call on the Immigration Minister Senator Vanstone to exercise her discretion by not ordering his repatriation.
