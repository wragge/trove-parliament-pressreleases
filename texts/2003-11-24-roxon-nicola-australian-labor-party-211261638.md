 Posturing before prosecuting   

 Ministers Downer and Ruddock both confirmed in question time today that the  Government is more interested in posturing on border protection than it is on  prosecuting people smugglers.   

 In their determination to avoid processing a maximum of 14 asylum claims from  people on the Minasa Bone the Government has let the boat and the four crew involved  in people smuggling to go free with no consequences. 

 M E D I A  R E L E A S E  

 

 “This just shows the Government’s policy is now back to front.”   

 “This Government will do anything to avoid processing claims - even going to the  ludicrous lengths of letting a crew of people smugglers go free.”   

 “This leaves the crew of the Minasa Bone and the boat itself able to load up with  another cargo of people and try to come to Australia again.”   

 “Is Australia going to keep sending asylum seekers away, without trying to break the  people smuggling rings?”   

 Labor believes we should prosecute all involved in this profiteering from human  misery.   

 “Minister Downer, despite referring to a regional cooperation arrangement with  Indonesia, knows full well that Indonesia does not yet have any people smuggling  laws.”   

 “Essentially the Government has shown it is happy to trade the prosecution of four  people smugglers just to avoid processing 14 asylum seeker claims.”   

 “I believe our immigration system is more robust than that and our priority should be  to break the people smuggling chains.   The Government’s action in this case has just  given them another chance.”   

 The Government should be ashamed that its policy is letting criminals go free.
