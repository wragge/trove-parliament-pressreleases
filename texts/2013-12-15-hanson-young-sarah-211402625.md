 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Monday, 16 December 2013   

 Refugee health to suffer as IHAG shut down   

 The Greens’ immigration spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who will be inspecting the  Nauru detention centre today, says the disbanding of the Immigration Health Advisory Group is a  concerning development from a government that is obsessed with secrecy.   

 “The government has shut down the flow of information to the Australian people and now it’s  shutting down the level of advice it receives,” Senator Hanson-Young said.   

 “Scrapping the IHAG is a regrettable, short sighted and cruel decision from this government.   

 “The IHAG is an essential source of information for any government that is interested in treating  people humanely, especially children, as it helps to highlight the adverse health effects of long-term  detention.   

 “Many of the people on IHAG are also involved in health oversight for the refugees on Nauru and  Manus Island.   

 “The Minister must immediately clarify whether the panels that oversee Australia’s offshore  detention centres will be affected by this terrible decision.”
