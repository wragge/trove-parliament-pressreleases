 STATION  

 PROGRAM Rehame Press Conference  DATE 29 March, 2004 

 TIME 10.30am 

 LOCATION Parliament House, Canberra  SUMMARY Press  conference  on  various  issues,  including  that  of  a  research   report into the views of young Australians.   

 Speakers:  Federal  Shadow  Minister  for  Children  and  Youth   Senator Jacinta Collins; Federal Opposition Leader Mark Latham.    

 

 SENATOR  JACINTA  COLLINS  -  FEDERAL  SHADOW  

 MINISTER FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH: 

 My  name  is  Senator  Jacinta  Collins.   I  am  the  Labor  Party  

 spokesperson  on  Children  and  Young  People  and  it’s  my  

 pleasure to welcome you all here today.  A special thanks to you 

 all  to  come  and  discuss  our  research  report  into  the  views  of  

 young people.  I think if I go around the room and acknowledge 

 all of the colleges that are here, Copeland (ph.sp.) … now we’re 

 missing one down here or are you all Copeland?  All Copeland?  

 Lyneham  High,  Belconnen  High,  Canberra  College,  Langland  

 (ph.sp.) High, Erindale College, and lots of them I just can’t quite 

 see.  Canberra High, great. 

 

 Thank  you  very  much  for  coming  along  and  being  prepared  to  

 have  dialogue  with  us  about  the  views  of  young  people.   We  

 think that’s a critically important process, so much so that some 

 students  today  from  Canberra  College  addressed  our  shadow  

 ministry  interpreting  the  research  and  the  report  that  we’ve  put  

  2   

 

 

 

  REF: M257204 

 

 

 together, and we hope to delve into a bit more detail a bit later 

 today in discussing some topics.   

 

 But  before  we  do  that,  Mark  Latham  has  very  kindly  offered  to  

 open  our  forum  today,  so  I’ll  leave  the  floor  to  Mark  to  raise  a  

 few issues that came from our discussion just half an hour ago. 

 

 MARK LATHAM - FEDERAL OPPOSITION LEADER: 

 Okay.   Well,  thanks  very  much,  Jacinta,  and  to  everyone  

 participating  in  the  forum.   I  want  to  thank  you  for  your  

 involvement.  Youth Week’s very important, and for those of us 

 in  the  Labor  Party  learning  and  acting  on  issues,  to  have  a  

 research  report,  to  have  your  deliberations  this  morning  is  vital  

 to our understanding of how we can improve our policies for the 

 benefit of young Australians.  

 

 One of the goals that I have set as Labor Leader is to get people 

 more  involved  in  the  political  process  because  the  feedback  I  

 get, particularly from younger Australians, is that while we have 

 a  vote  every  three  years,  what  happens  in  between  time,  why  

 can’t  we  have  a  say  on  an  ongoing  basis?   Instead  of  a  vote  

 every  three  years,  what  about  a  continuous  involvement  in  the  

 decisions  of  Australian  politics  -  local,  state,  territory  and  

 national?   

 

      3 

 

 

 

  REF : M257204 

 

 

 And I think it is important to open up our democracy as much as 

 possible  for  participation  and  we’ll  talk  about  the  balance  

 between  work,  family,  study,  community.   We  live  in  a  pretty  

 busy society so unless we’re actually going out of our way to get 

 people  involved  and  have  their  say  about  politics,  then  we’ll  

 never have a democracy that’s deep and meaningful. 

 

 So,  I  particularly  want  to  look  at  ways  in  which  we  can  get  

 younger Australians more involved, take an interest in the high 

 ideals, the public service, community, democracy itself.  There is 

 a lot of cynicism and distrust around and we can only break that 

 down by giving people a real say about the democratic process. 

 

 So that is important and I hope out of this forum, you can give us 

 information.   We  had  a  brief  discussion  when  the  presentation  

 was made to our shadow ministry about the best way for Labor 

 politicians  to  understand  and  respond  to  the  needs,  interests  

 and opinions of the next generation. 

 

 Just  looking  at  your  research  findings,  the  importance  of  

 education and health stand out, that is, matching the priorities of 

 the  Labor  Opposition.   In  education,  we’ve  set  some  important  

 benchmarks  that  we  want  to  follow.   One  is  that  no  person  of  

 your  age  who  studies  hard,  works  hard  at  school  and  gets  the  

 results would ever have to think that you couldn’t go on to your 

 best opportunity in life for financial reasons, that you wouldn’t be 

      4 

 

 

 

  REF : M257204 

 

 

 deterred  from  a  higher  education,  that  the  finances  would  be  

 moderate enough to allow all Australians who get those results, 

 who  work  hard  and  study  hard  through  school,  to  go  on  to  

 university or TAFE.   

 

 So,  our  policy  there  is  not  just  about  expanding  the  system  -  

 twenty thousand extra places in each university and TAFE - but 

 making  the  finances  more  moderate,  bringing  HECS  back  to  a  

 moderate  repayment  scheme  where  it  was  intended  under  the  

 last Labor government and getting rid of the full fee system.   

 

 The  other  important  benchmark  we’ve  set  is  that  every  

 Australian school can be a high achievement school.  We don’t 

 want  a  divisive  national  debate  between  government  and  non-government  schools.   We  want  to  get  the  money  to  where  it’s  

 needed  most  -  the  needy  schools  in  both  sectors  -  and  do  

 some other things in terms of teacher expertise, discipline, more 

 male teachers, needs-based funding, that provide students and 

 parents  with  a  guarantee  that  all  our  schools  will  be  good  

 schools with high achievement. 

 

 The  third  element  that  I’ve  been  promoting  in  education  is  the  

 importance  of  early  childhood  learning,  the  fact  that  education  

 doesn’t start the first day of school.  It starts the first day of life.  

 And  those  vital  years,  nought  to  five,  are  crucial  in  terms  of  

 building  opportunity  for  all.   I  think  common  sense  and  a  lot  of  

      5 

 

 

 

  REF : M257204 

 

 

 research  shows  that  the  pathways  to  educational  achievement  

 and  educational  disadvantage  are  already  opening  up  by  the  

 age of five.  You can pretty well tell what’s happened in terms of 

 pre-school  access,  child  care,  reading  in  the  home,  valuing  

 education in the home, what is going to happen to a five year old 

 whether  they  go  through  to  university  and  post-secondary  

 studies or not. 

 

 So,  early  childhood  development’s  the  important  missing  link  

 and we’ve put some issues on the agenda, released a policy for 

 a  national  reading  program,  and  we’ve  got  more  to  come  in  

 terms of early childhood development. 

 

 So,  they’re  very  important  commitments  that  we’ve  set.   

 Hopefully, they’re good responses to your priorities in education, 

 but we want to learn more.  And Jacinta will be here to soak up 

 that  information  and  bring  it  back  to  our  shadow  ministry  

 deliberations.  

 

 In  health,  our  priorities  are  to  restore  the  universality  of  

 Medicare.  Labor won’t be giving up on bulk billing.  We won’t be 

 putting  up  the  white  flag  about  bulk  billing.   We’ll  be  ensuring  

 that the rates are high, that bulk billing doctors are available in 

 Australian  communities  around  the  country.   We  don’t  see  the  

 need  for  a  safety  net.   You  only  need  a  safety  net  if  you  turn  

 Medicare  into  a  high  wire  act,  and  the  families  are  at  risk  of  

      6 

 

 

 

  REF : M257204 

 

 

 falling off.  And of course, we’ll also have initiatives to get back 

 to  the  principles  of  high  quality,  well-funded  public  hospitals  in  

 Australia that are (indistinct) part of the universality of Medicare. 

 

 So  they're  our  basic  responses  I  can  outline.   We've  got  other  

 initiatives  that  (indistinct)  respond  here  -  policy  on  asylum  

 seekers,  the  republic  -  other  matters  that  are  listed  in  your  

 research  report,  and  I  know  they'll  be  active  issues  for  

 consideration at this forum.  So I might stop there mindful of the 

 fact I've got to go back to our shadow cabinet but also mindful of 

 the  fact  I  want  to  open  up  for  any  questions  or  comments  you  

 want to put to me directly.  I say it's a chance for participation.  

 No good me just dashing off unless I hear your point of view and 

 we  can  field  some  questions  and  have  some  dialogue  in  the  

 time  that's  available  in  terms  of  my  participation  at  the  forum.   

 So any questions or comments you want to field to me?  Don't 

 feel bad about breaking the ice and being the first.   

 

 [Laughter] 

 

 LATHAM: 

 Someone's got to do it. 

 

 FEMALE SPEAKER: 

      7 

 

 

 

  REF : M257204 

 

 

 You've  mentioned  spending  a  lot  more  money  on  various  

 programs.   Does  that  mean  that  you're  going  to  raise  taxes?   

 Sorry if it's a stupid question. 

 

 LATHAM: 

 No, no, no, it's a question that our friends in the media put on a 

 regular basis so don't feel bad about that.  No, our intention is to 

 reduce  government  waste  and  mismanagement.   There's  no  

 shortage of money that comes into Canberra.  We've already got 

 the  highest  taxing  government  in  Australia's  history.   We  don't  

 want to worsen that record for a high level of taxation.  We want 

 to make better use of the money that's available and that means 

 making  decisions,  making  choices,  eliminate  waste  and  

 mismanage  government  resources,  and  putting  them  into  the  

 front  line  of  community  services,  particularly  in  education  and  

 health.  

 

 So  we  don't  see,  given  the  fact  we've  already  got  Australia's  

 highest taxing government ever, but you need to work from that 

 record.   You  just  need  to  make  better  use  of  the  money  that's  

 already available. 

 

 FEMALE SPEAKER: 

 Can I ask a question about the environment? 

 

 LATHAM: 

      8 

 

 

 

  REF : M257204 

 

 

 Yeah. 

 

 FEMALE SPEAKER: 

 I was wondering … I noticed that you were in Tasmania a couple 

 of weeks ago (indistinct) the forest situation down there. What is 

 the  Labor  Party’s  stance  on  environmental  preservation  

 (indistinct) in Australia? 

 

 LATHAM: 

 Well,  in  Tasmania,  I  went  down  there  to  learn  about  the  issue  

 first hand and had two days.  One hearing from the forestry and 

 the employment interest and the other hearing from Bob Brown, 

 an  environmental  interest.   And  my  conclusion  was  we  should  

 be  phasing  out  the  clear  felling  of  old  growth  forests  and  also  

 doing  more  nationally  to  help  with  the  preservation  of  

 Tasmanian forests. 

 

 They've  got  forty  per  cent  of  their  native  forests  under  reserve  

 and we should be doing more in terms of national responsibility, 

 particularly world heritage funding.  And beyond that, we've got 

 commitments  to  ratify  the  Kyoto  Protocol  and  establish  the  

 carbon  trading,  the  emission  trading  system  that  would  be  

 beneficial  for  the  Australian  economy  as  well  as  the  

 environment. 

 

      9 

 

 

 

  REF : M257204 

 

 

 We've  got  a  very  strong  policy  for  saving  the  grand  old  river  

 system, the Murray-Darling, and we'll be announcing some other 

 initiatives  about  urban  environment  and  particular  parts  of  

 Australia.  There's some issues in northern Australia as well as 

 Tasmania, so we like to think of environment in terms of, sort of, 

 the spheres of government, international commitment, Kyoto, big 

 national  resource,  Murray-Darling,  and  then  regional  and  some  

 urban environment initiatives that get, you know, a lot closer to 

 where  all  Australians  are  at  in  terms  of  their  interaction,  their  

 daily interaction with the environment. 

 

 So  we'll  have  a  pretty  comprehensive  package  come  election  

 time  and  for  us  it's  a  huge  issue.   It’s  …  we  just  can't  leave  a  

 deteriorating environment for your generation.  You look at those 

 climate  change  numbers  and  other  projections  which  are  truly  

 frightening  and  we'll  have  environmental  policies  that  respond  

 accordingly. 

 

 MALE SPEAKER: 

 What are the Labor Party's view on the republic? 

 

 LATHAM: 

 Our view on the republic is that we want it but we've got to get a 

 better process than we had last time where I think a lot of people 

 felt excluded from the process.  Some, sort of, powerful people 

 met down in Old Parliament House and said, here's the model, 

      10 

 

 

 

  REF : M257204 

 

 

 Australians  go  and  vote  for  it,  well  we  need  to  involve  all  the  

 Australian  people  in  formulating  the  model  so  there's  a  real  

 sense  of  ownership  and  participation.   That  in  essence  is  the  

 republican ideal. 

 

 So  our  strategy  is  to  have  a  series  of  plebiscites  where  the  

 Australian  people  can  have  ownership  of  the  republic,  rather  

 than  a  convention,  a  couple  of  hundred  people  sitting  down  in  

 Old  Parliament  House,  we  want  people  -  all  Australians  of  

 voting  age  -  to  have  ownership  and  participation.   So  the  first  

 question  will  be,  do  you  want  to  become  a  republic.   If  the  

 Australian  people  say  no,  well,  that's  the  end  of  the  matter.   If  

 they say yes, we go on to the second question, is which model 

 do you want, and the Australian people can vote on the model of 

 their choice. 

 

 That might be the direct election one, which is one I personally 

 support,  or  the  …  what’s  known  …  what  used  to  be  known  as  

 the Turnbull model.  I don't know if his currency's still good … 

 

 [Laughter] 

 

 LATHAM: 

 … in that regard.  And then you've got the minimalist one, I think 

 it was known as the McGarvie model, so there'll be a series of 

 options where people can choose the model that they want and 

      11 

 

 

 

  REF : M257204 

 

 

 then  that  can  go  forward  to  a  formal  referendum  where  people  

 can  hopefully  get  through  the  constitutional  change  that's  

 needed.   A  majority  of  votes  in  a  majority  of  states  and  an  

 overall national majority as well.   

 

 So  that's  the  process  that  we  want  to  set  up  which  is  

 participatory, it’s inclusive, it's a new style which is not politicians 

 or anyone else saying, look, here's the model, take it or leave it, 

 it's the Australian people themselves determining their model for 

 an Australian republic. 

 

 MALE SPEAKER: 

 I  was  just  wondering,  on  page  four  of  the  survey,  there's  a  

 question  (indistinct).   We  were  just  wondering  what  was  

 (indistinct)? 

 

 LATHAM: 

 Well,  this  is  a  …  it's  always  a  topical  issue.   Unfortunately,  Mr  

 Downer, the Foreign Minister, often frames the question in terms 

 of  Australian  policy  -  do  we  agree  or  disagree  with  the  United  

 States?   From  a  Labor  perspective,  we  always  look  at  it,  is  it  

 good or bad for Australia?  Our interest, that's the test that's got 

 to be applied.   

 

 In  the  Labor  Party,  we're  proud  of  the  fact  we  established  the  

 American  alliance  during  World  War  Two  with  John  Curtin  and  

      12 

 

 

 

  REF : M257204 

 

 

 we've  supported  it  ever  since,  but  we've  never  seen  it  as  a  

 rubber  stamp.   If  there  are  issues  and  areas  where  Australia  

 disagrees  according  to  our  national  interests,  then  within  the  

 framework  of  the  alliance,  we  should  have  that  capacity.   And  

 from  a  Labor  point  of  view,  that  happens  from  time  to  time,  it  

 happened during the Vietnam War, it happened during the Iraq 

 conflict, it's possible it could happen again.  

 

 But you've really got to have that basic test, is it good or bad for 

 Australia,  rather  than  Mr  Downer's  test,  is  do  you  agree  or  

 disagree with the United States?  The other thing we say about 

 the alliance is that it's very important but we also need to build 

 Australia's self-reliance within its framework.  So always build up 

 the defence of Australia in the war against terror, do more in this 

 country to keep the home front sound to keep Australians safe 

 and  sound,  always  ensure  that  our  self-reliance  as  a  nation  is  

 strong and do that within the terms of the alliance where it's not 

 a rubber stamp.  It's something that can be handled in a mature 

 way according to Australia's best national interests.  

 

 MALE SPEAKER: 

 The  government  is  raising  the  bar  for  people  who  want  to  be  

 teachers, (indistinct)? 

 

 LATHAM: 

      13 

 

 

 

  REF : M257204 

 

 

 Well,  we're  always  urging  our  state  and  territory  colleagues  to  

 build up the status of teaching, and just from the weekend, I met 

 with  the  primary  school  principals  association  and  outlined  our  

 plans to ensure that there's extra money in struggling schools to 

 get  in  the  best  teachers.   Get  the  best  expertise  in  school  

 leadership  to  bring  their  schools  up  to  a  strong  national  

 standard.   

 

 So  we'll  have  a  targeted  federal  initiative  to build up the status 

 and  rewards  of  teaching,  targeted  at  those  schools  that  are  

 struggling  and  getting  the  highest  level  of  teacher  expertise  in.   

 And  beyond  that,  we're  also  committed,  resolving  this  issue  

 about  the  number  of  male  teachers.   We  do  need  more  male  

 teachers  in  our  primary  schools.   The  government  wanted  to  

 change  the  Sex  Discrimination  Act  for  the  sake  of  twelve  

 scholarships.  Our view is you don't need to change the act to do 

 those twelve scholarships, and in any case, we want more than 

 twelve  men  …  extra  men  involved  in  our  schools,  we  want  

 thousands.   

 

 So  we'll  be  running  a  targeted  campaign  at  boys  in  years  ten,  

 eleven  and  twelve  to  encourage  the  status  and  importance  of  

 teaching,  get  them  through  to  our  extra  teaching  places  in  the  

 universities and give them pathways and other forms of support 

 that build up the number of men in our schools, not just teaching 

 but also mentors and others involved in sporting programs.  

      14 

 

 

 

  REF : M257204 

 

 

 

 So there's a lot to be done, not just in the status of teaching but 

 in  particular  to  rebalance  the  gender  characteristics  of  the  

 profession.  We need more male school students going through 

 to be male teachers so they can act as role models and mentors 

 for boys in our primary schools in particular, and that's going to 

 have a good social as well as educational impact.  

 

 FEMALE SPEAKER: 

 [inaudible question] 

 

 LATHAM: 

 Well, we've always supported the process of reconciliation.  We 

 believe  in  the  apology  to  the  stolen  generation  as  an  act  of  

 reconciliation.   In  terms  of  family  value,  if  anyone  split  up  my  

 family, I'd expect apologies down the track.  But we also have a 

 very strong commitment to repairing systems of government … 

 governance.  

 

 The current government has gutted ATSIC and it's got some real 

 problems that need to be addressed.  And our determination is 

 to  get  the  money  through  to  the  services,  get  the  resources  

 through and the services through to the people who need them 

 to build strong regional and community partnerships.  So you've 

 got federal, state, territory and communities all pulling in the one 

 direction to overcome Aboriginal poverty.  

      15 

 

 

 

  REF : M257204 

 

 

 

 Recently,  I  was  on  a  tour  of  the  Northern  Territory  and,  you  

 know, we've got to face the fact as a country, we've got pockets 

 of third world poverty in some of our communities and we can't 

 just,  sort  of,  pretend  they're  not  there  or  run  our  lives  so  that  

 they're  never  visible.   We've  got  to  address  pockets  of  third  

 world poverty in Indigenous communities and bring them up to a 

 first world standard, a standard we all take for granted, mostly, 

 as Australian citizens.  

 

 So, you know, it's a big issue.  We need reconciliation, we also 

 need  an  end  to  Aboriginal  poverty  and  we  need  some  serious  

 reform  of  Aboriginal  governance  and  federal  government  

 programs to achieve those results. 

 

 MALE SPEAKER: 

 How do you feel about the junior rates of pay?  Do you feel that 

 they … that for (indistinct) year olds should be paying … should 

 be getting paid less than seventeen year olds? 

 

 LATHAM: 

 Our  plans  for  the  (indistinct)  national  conference  is  to  take  it  

 case  by  case  and  look  at  the  competencies  and  skills,  and  

 rather than making it a definitive policy, like the government has 

 of  applying  the  junior  rates,  we  l o o k  a t  t h e m  c a s e  b y  c a s e  o n  

 competencies.   So  if  there's  a  competency  argument  for  the  

      16 

 

 

 

  REF : M257204 

 

 

 higher  rate,  then  that's  one  that  could  be  sustained  before  the  

 Industrial Relations Commission. 

 

 COLLINS: 

 Thank you very much. 

 

 LATHAM: 

 One more?  (indistinct) question here.  Yeah? 

 

 FEMALE SPEAKER: 

 What’s Labor’s stance on (indistinct)? 

 

 LATHAM: 

 Well, we believe in strong border protection, we've got a policy 

 for  the  coastguard  and  other  strategies  to  deter  people  

 smugglers,  tougher  penalties.   But  in  terms  of  mandatory  

 detention,  we  never  set  up  that  system  as  one  of  punishment.   

 Mr Ruddock has used it as punishment that people can be there 

 for five or six years.  

 

 We  want  to  have  a  fast  processing  of  asylum  seekers  so  that  

 they're  in  and  out  quickly,  work  out  their  credentials.   If  they're  

 genuine  refugees,  welcomed  into  the  Australian  community.   If  

 they're not, they have to go home.  And in terms of children, we 

 want the children out from detention centres.  In terms of family 

 values,  we  shouldn't  have  children  growing  up  behind  barbed  

      17

 commitment  that  we've  got  -  humanise,  civilise  the  detention  

 centres, post-Ruddock, post-Vanstone. 

 

 Okay, have a great forum, and… 

 

 MALE SPEAKER: 

 Before you go, what do you make of Mr Howard’s (indistinct) to 

 have a white paper into terrorism? 

 

 LATHAM: 

 Well,  the  government  seems  to  be  having  a  lot  of  reviews  and  

 reports  about  terrorism.   I  think  the  Australian  people  want  

 action, and it's indicative of the government that eight days ago 

 said it was having a review of maritime security.  Well, two and a 

 half  years  after  September  eleven,  the  Australian  people  want  

 action rather than extra reports and reviews.  

 

 That's  why  the  government  should  establish  our  policy  for  a  

 Department of Homeland Security for improved regional airport 

 security, improved port security.  So action counts for a lot more 

 than reports and reviews, and that would be the best outcome in 

 terms of making Australia safe and sound for the future.

 And  this  morning,  the  Liberal  MP  Andrew  Southcott  was  

 continuing  the  personal  attacks  against  you,  calling  you  erratic  

 and dangerous if you were to become Prime Minister. 

 

 LATHAM: 

 Yes, well I've heard these attacks, last week, associations with 

 al-Qaeda  and  bin  Laden  and  all  this  sort  of  nonsense.   Well,  I  

 can only assume that people like Southcott are now saying the 

 same  thing  about  their  own  Prime  Minister,  given  his  

 announcement  yesterday  that  the  government's  taking  out  a  

 third of our Iraqi contingent in June, prior to the handover to the 

 sovereign government in that country.  

 

 So given Mr Howard's announcement yesterday, I suppose he's 

 following Labor policy yet again.  He's taking a third of the Iraqi 

 contingent  out  in  June  and  I  can  only  assume  that  these  

 backbenchers  on  the  doorstop  are  …  the  doors  of  Parliament  

 House, are making the same character references for their own 

 Prime Minister. 

 

 FEMALE SPEAKER: 

 The shadow cabinet approved your (indistinct)? 

 

 LATHAM: 

 Well, shadow cabinet resolved twelve months ago that a Labor 

 government would bring the troops back immediately.  So this is

 not  a  new  development  in  the  Labor  Party,  and  you  wouldn't  

 expect  a  Labor  Party  that  opposed  the  war  in  Iraq  to  keep  the  

 troops there any longer than we needed to.  And Kevin Rudd in 

 November set out that the handover of sovereign government in 

 Iraq was the logical point to start up an exit strategy so this has 

 been Labor policy for twelve months - twelve months. 

 

 FEMALE SPEAKER: 

 But have you put it to the (indistinct)…  

 

 LATHAM: 

 Well,  it's  been  Labor  policy  for  twelve  months  and  shadow  

 cabinet  twelve  months  ago  said  that  it  wanted  the  troops  out  

 straight  away  under  a  Labor  government,  and  that's  consistent  

 with the timetable that I outlined last week.   

 

 And in terms of the meeting, we had ten minutes before I had to 

 come up here and now I'll return so we can have a bit more than 

 ten minutes of deliberation on a whole range of issues.   

 

 Thanks very much. 

 

 [Applause]
