 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER  THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  RAAF BASE, WILLIAMTOWN   

 

 Subjects: Afghanistan; border protection; roads; Fort Scratchley; workplace reform;  Labor’s union affiliation   

 EO&E…………………………………………………………………………………   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well hello there, do you have any questions? I just want to say how great it has been  to visit this terrific air force base, it’s not the first time I’ve been here, but I’ve had a  great opportunity to be briefed on the radar responsibility that Australia will be  assuming in Kandahar. We’re sending 75 people and they’re taking over a major radar  operation from the Americans and I was given a very detailed briefing on precisely  what they would be doing and without going into things I can’t go into to, it’s a  reminder of the extraordinary professionalism and high responsibilities that our forces 

 are accepting, not only in the military operational areas, but also in providing such  extremely important, in fact critical, high level technical support, not only for  Australian forces in Afghanistan but also for our coalition partners. Any questions?   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Howard, this refugee swap that we’re doing with the US, do you really believe  that somebody who’s trying to make it Australia will be deterred by the thought that  the default option is to go the US?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 I think people who want to come to Australia will be deterred by anything that sends a  message that getting to the Australian mainland illegally is not going to happen.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 If they go to the US, isn’t that just as good an option for them.   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 I think people who set out for this country in the full knowledge that they’ll be  prevented from coming to the Australian mainland will be additionally deterred by  this understanding. This understanding is just one part, it’s not going to take over the  whole thing. An important point to make is that since we adopted very tough border 

 protection policies in 2001, the number of people trying to come here, illegally, has  virtually dried up. So our policies have been very successful and this will reinforce  the deterrent effect of our policies.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Then accepting people who are trying to get into US, as in Cuban refugees, does that  make a difference?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well we’re going to look at any exchanges on a case by case basis and we’re not  talking about large numbers.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd’s headed to the US, do you think it’s a journey to try and  mend some of the damage done by Labor leaders in the past?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well he can explain why he’s going, it’s not, how shall I put it, it’s not the first time  an Opposition Leader has been to the United States and it’s proper that Opposition  Leaders go to the United States. I’m not criticising him for going to America, there’s  no doubt that the policies of Mr Latham, for example, did enormous damage to the  US-Australian relationship. But look, when any political leader goes abroad I try and  restrict my criticism because I’m interested in this country being viewed favourably  from abroad. 

 

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Howard, will your Government help fund a new football stadium for Newcastle?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well our position to date has been that, and it’s been the position of our local member,  that he prefers additional funding to go into roads and on that subject I’ll be making a  very important announcement about some road funding in this area a little later at a  community gathering.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Are you saying that Bob Baldwin’s campaigned against the stadium?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 No I haven’t said that. I am just saying he is a roads man. Bob Baldwin supports  investment in roads and Bob Baldwin has been supremely successful in twisting arms  on roads.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 What about the M3 Link Road then? Why haven’t see any firm, a lot of money  committed to that?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well we do a lot of things on roads and we have a budget coming up and we have an  AusLink extension so I think it’s fair to say that this part of the world will be very  fairly treated in road funding by this Government. 

 

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Howard, you came to Fort Scratchley in Newcastle several years ago and  announced it would be restored. It’s in worse condition now than it was due to slow  work and vandals are destroying it slowly. What can we do to get that project going?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 We’re looking at that issue right at the moment in a very sympathetic fashion and I  suggest you keep your ear tuned.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 So you may be putting in some more funding towards that?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 I suggest you keep your ear tuned.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Howard, what’s your position on the Tillegra Dam. The dam worth hundreds of  millions the New South Wales Government has proposed for Dungog as an answer to  the Hunters… 

 

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well you ought to ask Mr Iemma. I don’t build dams.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Well do you think they’re a sensible solution?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well look I think the anti-dams policies of the Labor Governments in New South  Wales have been disastrous. I mean what successive Labor Governments around the  country have done over the last few years is sell out to the Greens and stop building 

 dams and that’s part of the reason why we have water restrictions in our major capital  cities; not only New South Wales, but it’s also Queensland. They had a dam that Mr  Rudd and Mr Goss cancelled when they were running Queensland some years ago  and I have just been up there and I have seen the consequences of it, and whilst the  circumstances are a bit different, the principle’s the same here in New South Wales.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 What’s your reaction to Mr Rudd’s IR policies?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well he’s done what the unions want. I think the reintroduction of the unfair dismissal  laws will be very badly received by small business. It will slow the job creation effort  of small business over the last year. There is no doubt that getting rid of the unfair  dismissal laws has encouraged small business to take on more staff and bringing them  back will discourage them from taking on more staff and it will lead to an increase in  unemployment. So it’s a bad-for-jobs policy.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Is Craig Baumann’s win in the state seat of Port Stephens encouraging for the Liberal  future of the Hunter?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well it’s encouraging for Bob here. He likes it very much. I think it’s a great tribute to  Craig personally and it was a terrific win and I expect that he will increase his  majority significantly at the next election. It is encouraging and it’s a reminder that  these stereotypical attitudes about, you know, the Hunter being all Labor or something  like that, they’re things of the past. I mean we’ve broken that mould at a federal level  and there’s no reason we shouldn’t continue to break it at a state level as well. This is  a very diverse area and people should not make assumptions about its political  allegiance. That is a huge mistake.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Do you think that means Greg Combet, if he was put into the seat of Charlton,  wouldn’t do as well as he may have done in the past?   

 PRIME MINISTER: 

 

 Well that is a rather safer Labor area and I mean I think if Mr Combet does go into  Hunter, and I think it’s…look they should stop mucking around. He’s coming to  Parliament and he’s going to be a Minister in the Labor Government if they win;  you’ll have, what, Combet as a Minister, Ferguson as a Minister, Crean as a Minister,  maybe Jennie George as a Minister. They’re all former Presidents or Secretaries of the  ACTU. You won’t be able to persuade Australians that it’s not a union dominated  Government. Thank you.
