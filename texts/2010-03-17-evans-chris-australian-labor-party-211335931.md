 MEDIA RELEASE 

 SIEV 36 - NT Coroner's findings  Wednesday, 17 March 2010 

 The Northern Territory Coroner has today indicated that he will refer his findings to  the NT Commissioner of Police and the NT Director of Public Prosecutions to  determine whether criminal charges can been laid in relation to the explosion on  SIEV 36 in April 2009. 

 These are now matters for the police and criminal justice system to investigate and  progress in accordance with Australian law. 

 The Department of Immigration and Citizenship will provide all possible assistance to  the NT Police and NT Director of Public Prosecutions, if requested. 

 The individuals concerned will be subject to Australian laws and penalties should any  charges and subsequent convictions arise from the NT Police investigations. 

 People convicted of serious crimes can have their visa cancelled under section 501  of the Migration Act. 

 Where a decision is made to cancel a person's visa under section 501 of the Act,  they become an unlawful non-citizen and are liable for detention and removal from  Australia as soon as reasonably possible. A person who has been removed from  Australia after cancellation of their visa under section 501 of the Act is permanently  barred from returning to Australia. 

 The granting of Protection Visas to the passengers on board SIEV 36 last year  followed the decision by the NT Police at that time not to charge any people in  relation to the explosion. 

 The NT Police made clear at that time that there was insufficient evidence to charge  any person with criminal offences relating to the explosion. Furthermore, the NT  Police were consulted about finalising the group's Protection Visa applications and  confirmed in writing that: 'The NT Police supports the granting of permanent visas for  the passengers.' 

 The Protection Visas were granted in accordance with Australian law and Australia's  international obligations under the UN Refugee Convention once all health, security  and identity checks had been completed.
