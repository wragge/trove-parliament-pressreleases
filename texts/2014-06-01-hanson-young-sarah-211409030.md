 Christmas Island protest: a picture of despair    

 The large scale protest and hunger strike on Christmas Island regarding the Abbott  Government's response to the death of Reza Barati are a direct result of the Coalition's  needlessly cruel immigration regime, the Australian Greens have said.    

 "After ignoring the build up in tensions on Manus, the Abbott Government must address the  Christmas Island protests," the Greens' immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 "Locking up refugees and refusing to process their claims is a senseless and spiteful policy.    

 "The Abbott Government's cruelty is creating a toxic and tense environment in the  detention network that must be addressed before it's too late.    

 "Past experience has shown the terrible result of ignoring the legitimate concerns of people  who are locked up on Christmas Island.    

 "Processing must resume and the Government must give people a fair go instead of endless  cruelty."
