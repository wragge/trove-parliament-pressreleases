 OPENING ADDRESS

 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 SENATOR NICK BOLKUS

 LAUNCH OF SOUTH AUSTRALIAN REFUGEE WEEK

 RUNDLE MALL, ADELAIDE

 MONDAY 21 JUNE 1993, 10:30AM

 COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY MICAH

 1.

 I AM VERY PLEASED TO BE LAUNCHING REFUGEE WEEK IN MY HOME STATE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA.  I THANK THE REFUGEE WEEK COMMITTEE FOR EXTENDING TO ME AN INVITATION TO DO SO.

 NATIONAL REFUGEE WEEK PRESENTS TO US A TIMELY OPPORTUNITY TO REMEMBER THE PLIGHT OF BOTH REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE PURPOSE OF REFUGEE WEEK IS TO INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE REFUGEE SITUATION. THE RUNDLEâ¢MALL -TODAY AS BUSY AS EVER - PROVIDES AN IDEAL OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE THIS AIM.

 WHILE NIGHTLY OUR TELEVISION SCREENS CONFRONT US WITH THE HORRORS OF WAR, AND WITH THE HUMAN SUFFERING OF INNOCENT VICTIMS - MANY OF THEM WOMEN AND CHILDREN - THIS WEEK OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLACE THESE IMAGES IN â¢A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE AND TO ASSESS AUSTRALIA'S SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THIS WORLD-WIDE PROBLEM.

 ACCORDING TO THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES, A BODY WITHIN WHICH AUSTRALIA PLAYS AN ACTIVE ROLE, THERE ARE MORE THAN 19 MILLION REFUGEES AND 'PEOPLE OF CONCERN' IN THE WORLD TODAY, AN INCREASE OF TWO MILLION SINCE THE END OF 1991.

 WHEN ONE ADDS TO THIS THE NUMBER OF DISPLACED PERSONS, THE FIGURE REACHES MORE THAN 40 MILLION.

 WHILE THESE NUMBERS ARE CERTAINLY ALARMING AND SHOULD CONCERN ALL OF US, IT MUST ALSO BE REMEMBERED THAT THE HIGH COMMISSIONER CONSIDERS THAT ONLY 72,000 OF THEM REQUIRE RESETTLEMENT IN OTHER COUNTRIES. RESETTLEMENT IS A 'LAST RESORT' OPTION WHEN OTHER OPTIONS, SUCH AS SAFE RETURN TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY OR RESETTLEMENT

 IN A NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY OF FIRST ASYLUM, ARE CLEARLY NOT APPROPRIATE OR ACHIEVABLE.

 WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THESE 72,000 PEOPLE, AND AUSTRALIA BELIEVES THAT ALL COUNTRIES ABLE TO PLAY A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN THE RESETTLEMENT OF REFUGEES SHOULD DO SO.

 IN THIS CONTEXT, WE HAVE DONE OUR FAIR SHARE. OVER THE YEARS, AUSTRALIANS HAVE DEMONSTRATED COMPASSION FOR AND GENEROSITY TO THOSE LESS FORTUNATE THAN OURSELVES.

 OVER THE PAST FIVE DECADES, AUSTRALIA HAS PLAYED A LEADING ROLE IN THE RESETTLEMENT OF REFUGEES FROM VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD.

 OUR RECORD IS OUTSTANDING AND ONE OF WHICH WE CAN BE JUSTLY PROUD.

 RELATIVE TO OUR POPULATION, AUSTRALIA IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST RECIPIENTS OF REFUGEES.

 SINCE WORLD WAR II MORE THAN HALF A MILLION REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RESETTLED HERE.

 0

 OF THE FIVE COUNTRIES ACCEPTING SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF REFUGEES, WE RANK ALONG WITH THE USA AND CANADA AS ONE OF THE 'BIG THREE' AND

 OUR HUMANITARIAN PROGRAM, LIKE OUR MIGRATION PROGRAM, IS BOTH GLOBAL AND NON-DISCRIMINATORY

 WHILE THE NUMBER OF PLACES IN OUR OVERALL MIGRATION PROGRAM HAS FALLEN SLIGHTLY IN 1993-94, THE GOVERNMENT HAS EXPANDED THE HUMANITARIAN/REFUGEE PROGRAM THIS YEAR TO OFFER RESETTLEMENT TO AN EXTRA 1,000 FUNDED UN REFUGEES, BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER TO 13,000.

 GIVEN THIS RECORD, AUSTRALIA IS OFTEN SEEN AS A MODEL BY OTHER COUNTRIES.

 THIS HAS NOT COME ABOUT BY ACCIDENT.

 AUSTRALIANS HAVE LONG WELCOMED THOSE WHO ARRIVED HERE, OFTEN WITH LITTLE MORE THAN THEY COULD CARRY.

 AS WELL, GOVERNMENTS HAVE CAREFULLY MANAGED THE ENTRY PROGRAM AND HAVE RECOGNISED A NEED FOR SETTLEMENT AND MULTICULTURAL POLICIES TO ASSIST BOTH THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED AS WELL AS OUR SOCIETY IN GENERAL.

 AUSTRALIA'S RESPONSE TO THIS INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM, HOWEVER, IS NOT LIMITED TO RESETTLEMENT, FOR OFTEN A COORDINATED HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE IS REQUIRED, COMPRISING BOTH DIPLOMATIC AND AID INITIATIVES.

 AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS, EARLIER THIS YEAR THE GOVERNMENT ADOPTED A PACKAGE OF MEASURES DESIGNED TO IMPROVE AUSTRALIA'S CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH REFUGEES, DISPLACED PERSONS AND OTHER IN VULNERABLE POSITIONS.

 THE DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS, THE AUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE BUREAU AND THE DEPARTMENT -OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE ARE NOW WORKING TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT AUSTRALIA'S RESPONSE TO SITUATIONS OF HUMANITARIAN CRISIS

 IS COMPREHENSIVE AND, AS SUCH, THE BEST WE CAN DELIVER.

 IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT, THROUGH THE AUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE BUREAU, SOME $50 MILLION IS PROVIDED PER YEAR IN AID TO MEET THE ACUTE NEEDS OF REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PEOPLE.  THROUGH THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS PORTFOLIO, AUSTRALIA IS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES IN

 THIS POLICY AREA.

 OUR ULTIMATE AIM IS TO ENSURE THAT, BOTH NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE, AUSTRALIA'S RESPONSE TO CRISIS SITUATIONS WILL BE QUICK, COORDINATED AND TAILORED TO MEET SPECIFIC NEEDS, AND THAT THE

 RESETTLEMENT OPTION WILL MAINTAIN ITS PROPER PLACE WITHIN THE BROADER FRAMEWORK OF AUSTRALIA'S OVERALL HUMANITARIAN OBJECTIVES.

 3.

 THIS COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE IS PERHAPS BEST ILLUSTRATED BY AUSTRALIA'S EFFORTS IN THE CRISIS IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA.

 WE ARE AWARE OF THE ENORMOUS HUMAN SUFFERING CAUSED BY THE CONTINUING CONFLICT THERE. A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE IS, ACCORDING TO UNHCR ESTIMATES, SOME TWO MILLION REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS IN EUROPE.

 THERE ARE SOME WHO ARGUE THAT THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA IS A 'EUROPEAN' PROBLEM, BUT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALLEVIATING SUCH HUMAN SUFFERING CANNOT BE NEATLY DIVIDED UP ON A GEOGRAPHICAL BASIS.

 THIS RESPONSIBILITY RESTS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, IT IS ALSO A MATTER OF GRAVE AND CONTINUING CONCERN TO THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT. .

 HENCE OUR RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN GENEROUS, AND IMMEDIATE.

 A SPECIAL HUMANITARIAN MIGRATION CATEGORY WAS ESTABLISHED AND TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THIS SITUATION. IN THE LAST YEAR, OVER 3,200 DISPLACED PEOPLE WITH LINKS TO AUSTRALIA HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FOR RESETTLEMENT FROM THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA AND WE EXPECT AT LEAST THE SAME NUMBER NEXT FINANCIAL YEAR.

 AS WELL, WE RESPONDED QUICKLY TO AN APPEAL TO ASSIST WITH THE RESETTLEMENT OF FORMER PRISONERS OF WAR. WE OFFERED 250 PLACES TO THIS APPEAL THIS YEAR. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO PUT IN PLACE

 A MECHANISM TO ENABLE PEOPLE FROM THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA, TEMPORARILY IN AUSTRALIA, TO REMAIN HERE DURING THE CONFLICT.

 PEOPLE FROM THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA NOW REPRESENT THE SINGLE LARGEST COMPONENT OF OUR HUMANITARIAN PROGRAM. ASSISTANCE WAS ALSO PROVIDED THROUGH OTHER MEANS. WE PROVIDED $1.55 MILLION IN EMERGENCY AID, OVER $1 MILLION OF WHICH WAS CONTRIBUTED TO UN AGENCIES SUCH AS UNHCR AND UNICEF. $100,000 WAS SPECIFICALLY

 EAR-MARKED TO ASSIST WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

 LET ME NOW TURN TO ANOTHER CONTENTIOUS AREA, THE PROCESSING OF APPLICATIONS LODGED BY PEOPLE WHO CLAIM REFUGEE STATUS AFTER THEY ARRIVE IN AUSTRALIA.

 WE CAN CLAIM A GOOD RECORD IN THIS AREA AS WELL.

 SUCH PEOPLE RECEIVE A FULL AND FAIR HEARING IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONALLY-RECOGNISED GUIDELINES AND UN REFUGEE CONVENTION OBLIGATIONS. THESE PROCESSES ARE ADOPTED BY OUR OWN LAWS.

 AUSTRALIA, LIKE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, HAS EXPERIENCED A STEADY INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SUCH ASYLUM SEEKERS.

 THE NUMBER OF NEW APPLICATIONS BEING LODGED TOTALS SOME 300 PER MONTH AND APPLICANTS ARE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

 4.

 GIVEN THE GREAT DEMAND FOR MIGRATION TO AUSTRALIA, IT IS ONLY FAIR TO THOSE IN BOTH THE MIGRATION AND HUMANITARIAN PROCESSES OVERSEAS THAT APPLYING FOR REFUGEE STATUS IN AUSTRALIA DOES NOT BECOME, NOR IS IT SEEN TO BE, A WAY TO AVOID MEETING NORMAL REQUIREMENTS.

 IT IS IMPORTANT, THEREFORE, THAT WE ENSURE THAT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR HUMANITARIAN PROGRAM IS NOT COMPROMISED.

 WHILE WE DO NOT PREJUDICE THE CLAIMS OF ANY INDIVIDUAL, WE NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THOSE WHOSE FEAR OF PERSECUTION IS GENUINE AND WELL-FOUNDED, AND COMES WITHIN UN CONVENTION STANDARDS, AND THOSE WHOSE APPLICATIONS MAY REFLECT OTHER MOTIVES. IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT AUSTRALIA HAS IN PLACE A

 SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING REFUGEE STATUS HERE IN AUSTRALIA.

 IN THIS CONTEXT, WE SHOULD RECOGNISE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A GROWING PHENOMENON IN THE INTERNATIONAL ILLEGAL MOVEMENTS OF PEOPLE -- THE MOVEMENT OF INDENTURED LABOUR.

 THIS HAS BEEN EXPERIENCED BY THE USA. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT NEITHER OUR MECHANISMS, NOR OUR COMMUNITY BASED AGENCIES, ARE EXPLOITED BY SUCH CONTEMPORARY SLAVE TRADERS.

 AS WELL, THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES WE HAVE THE PROCEDURES AND PENALTIES TO HANDLE THE ORGANISERS OF THIS TRADE, THOSE WHO MANAGE THE "BOATS". WE WILL NOT SHY FROM USING THESE POWERS IF APPROPRIATE.

 PRIORITY WILL REMAIN FOR PEOPLE IN GENUINE NEED.

 OUR SYSTEM IS THOROUGH AND FAIR AND APPLIED TO ALL ON AN EQUAL BASIS, WHETHER THEY ARRIVE HERE BY BOAT OR PLANE, WHETHER WITH A VISA OR WITHOUT. HOWEVER, THOSE WHO ARRIVE HERE WITHOUT A VISA, THAT IS WITHOUT ANY LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ENTER THE COUNTRY, MUST, IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUSTRALIAN LAW, BE DETAINED WHILE THEIR CLAIMS RECEIVE CONSIDERATION.

 BOTH SIDES OF POLITICS ENDORSED THIS POLICY AS RECENTLY AS LAST YEAR. THE GOVERNMENT, FOR ITS PART, DOES NOT. DESIRE TO KEEP ANYONE APPLYING FOR REFUGEE STATUS IN DETENTION ANY LONGER THAN NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THEIR CLAIMS.  WE WISH TO SEE CASES

 SETTLED AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE WITHIN THE CONSTRAINTS OF FULL AND DUE PROCESS.

 WE IN AUSTRALIA TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY OUR HUMANITARIAN OBLIGATIONS AND NO PERSON WHO CLAIMS TO BE A REFUGEE IS EVER TURNED BACK FROM AUSTRALIA WITHOUT A FULL HEARING OF THEIR CLAIMS.

 I SHOULD ALSO MENTION 'THAT AS OF JULY THIS YEAR, THE INDEPENDENCE OF DETERMINATION PROCESS WILL BE FURTHER ENHANCED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INDEPENDENT REFUGEE REVIEW TRIBUNAL, A TRIBUNAL WHICH WILL RE-EXAMINE CASES WHERE THE INITIAL DECISION

 IS DISPUTED.

 N 7

 5.

 THIS TRIBUNAL WILL BE A STATUTORY BODY CONSISTING OF MEMBERS DRAWN FROM MANY AREAS OF THE COMMUNITY AND IT WILL HAVE FULL POWER TO OVERTURN NEGATIVE DECISIONS. -

 THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS FULLY COMMITTED TO A HUMANITARIAN PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH WE BOTH FULFIL OUR INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND PLAY A RESPONSIBLE AND COMPASSIONATE ROLE IN ASSISTING REFUGEES AND OTHER VICTIMS OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES

 WORLD WIDE.

 REGARDLESS OF OUR PROBLEMS, THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OVERSEAS -HOMELESS, DISPLACED OR VICTIMISED ON THE BASIS OF RACE, RELIGION OR POLITICAL PERSUASION - FOR WHOM LIFE IS UNIMAGINABLY WORSE. THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY WILL ALWAYS FIND A PLACE FOR SUCH PEOPLE.

 MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME HERE AS REFUGEES HAVE MADE A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TOWARD ENRICHING AND DEVELOPING AUSTRALIA BOTH CULTURALLY AND MATERIALLY.

 I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY REFUGEE WEEK PRESENTS TO REMIND US ALL OF THESE FACTS. I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE VIEWS WHICH WILL BE EXPRESSED BY THE ORGANISERS OF REFUGEE WEEK AND THE NUMBER OF OVERSEAS AND LOCAL GUEST SPEAKERS WHO HAVE BEEN

 INVITED.

 ABOVE ALL, I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT MANY AUSTRALIANS PARTICIPATE IN REFUGEE WEEK AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEBATE.

 I HEREBY DECLARE REFUGEE WEEK OPEN.
