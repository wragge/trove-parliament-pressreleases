 Tampa Decision: Government Needs Lawful Basis For Holding Of Tampa Asylum Seekers Robert McClelland - Shadow Attorney-General

 Media Statement - 11 September 2001

 Today's decision by the Federal Court of Australia shows the pitfalls of making policy on the run.

 Justice North found there was no lawful basis for the detention by Australian troops of the people on board the Tampa.

 The Government has indicated, and we think appropriately, that it would appeal if the decision went against the Commonwealth. The Federal Opposition supports that appeal taking place.

 The Opposition has repeatedly indicated that it is prepared to offer a bipartisan solution to the question of illegal immigration generally. More importantly, the Opposition is also willing to work with the Government on a solution specifically to deal with the Tampa situation.

 But, clearly, before any solution can be found, the Government must articulate precisely what it intends to do rather than making it up as it goes along - as it has been doing.

 Today's decision confirms the Government's Border Protection Bill was entirely misconceived. It would have had no effect on the decision in any way, shape or form.

 Despite the draconian nature of the Border Protection Bill, it provided no lawful authority for the detention of those aboard the Tampa.

 Further, the course of action adopted by the Government - which involved moving people off the Tampa onto another vessel to be transported to another country - was not even contemplated by the Border Protection Bill.

 While the Government won't release the figures, it is reported that it has spent something in the order of $70-$130 million in respect to this issue.

 The illegal entry of people into Australia has been an increasing problem during the period of this Government.

 This Government has had five years to get strategies in place, but has adopted a panicked response because an election is weeks away.

 It now appears that the Government has at least three separate agendas in respect to illegal immigrants.

 One is to expel boats from Australian waters. Another is to use expensive naval vessels to take people to other nations which are acting transit stations. Another is to excise Christmas Island and Ashmore Reef from Australia's migration zone.

 The Australian people want a government that has a long-term and coordinated strategy with respect to illegal immigration - not one that simply throws millions of dollars of taxpayers' money to buy off an embarrassing situation until the next election.

 Central to any long-term solution is fixing relationships with our neighbours and putting in place a year round Coast Guard. Authorised by Geoff Walsh, 19 National Circuit, Barton ACT 2600.
