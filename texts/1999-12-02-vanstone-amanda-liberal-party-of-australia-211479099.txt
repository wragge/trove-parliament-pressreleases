  Another boat carrying suspected illegal immigrants has been detected , 
the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, announced 
today.

  

 The vessel, a motorised Indonesian fishing boat, arrived 
late yesterday at Ashmore Islands with six people and two crew on board.

  

 Crew of the Environment Australia vessel,   Aurelia IV , which is stationed at Ashmore Islands and which 
assists the Coastwatch surveillance network, reported the boat’s arrival.

  

 Customs Coastwatch has tasked the Customs vessel   Botany Bay , 
which has been patrolling waters off north-west Australia, to bring 
the people to the mainland where they will be processed by officials 
from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.

  

 Senator Vanstone said the latest vessel to be detained, 
the first for December, followed last month’s record influx of 14 
boats containing 1247 people.
