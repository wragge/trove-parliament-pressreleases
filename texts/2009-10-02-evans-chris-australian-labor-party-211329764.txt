 Senator Chris Evans  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 

 Indonesian boat arrivals returned 

 A group of 62 Indonesian men who arrived on Christmas Island on September 19  has been returned to Indonesia, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship,  Senator Chris Evans, said today. 

 The 58 passengers and four crew, who claimed to be from Java, were intercepted  230 nautical miles north of Broome on September 15. They requested removal after  being told they had not raised any issues which might engage Australia’s protection  obligations. 

 ‘The government has made its position clear. People who are owed Australia’s  protection under our international obligations will be granted that protection,’ Senator  Evans said.  

 ‘All irregular maritime arrivals found not to be owed protection and with no other  basis to remain in Australia will be removed.’ 

 The handling of the group demonstrated the Australian Government’s commitment to  dealing with irregular maritime arrivals in a timely and effective manner. 

 ‘This group of 62 people has not raised any issues under the Refugees Convention,’  Senator Evans said.  

 ‘Irregular maritime arrivals are initially interviewed to assess, among other things,  their reasons for travel to Australia.  

 ‘Someone who is seeking better economic opportunities does not meet the criteria  for a protection visa.’ 

 Since the beginning of this year, 21 people who arrived by boat have returned home  voluntarily and removal arrangements are being finalised for another six people who  have requested to return home. Another nine are currently in the process of being  removed.  

 ‘Australia does not return asylum seekers to their country of origin without fully  assessing any claims for protection,’ the minister said.
