   Christine Milne 

 Australian Senate  Australian Greens Leader 

 media release

  Wednesday 8 May 2013  Commonwealth must relocate CHOGM from Sri Lanka   The Australian Greens are calling on Julia Gillard to stop ignoring human rights abuses in Sri Lanka and push for CHOGM to be relocated.  "It is wrong for the Commonwealth to legitimise the human rights abuses of the Rajapaksa regime by proceeding to hold CHOGM in Sri Lanka," Senator Christine Milne said.  "Anyone who dissents from the Rajapaksa regime in Sri Lanka is under threat of arrest, imprisonment or disappearance including judges, academics, journalists or opposition politicians.  "It is time Labor admitted that torture and human rights abuse is evident in Sri Lanka.  "Pretending otherwise is deliberate blindness to the abuses outlined by the Canadian Government, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and many other organisations.  “Opposition Leader Azad Sally was arrested recently for campaigning against the regime.   “Geoffrey Robertson investigated the impeachment of Sri Lanka’s Chief Justice earlier this year, and found the country’s legal system seriously wanting.  "Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott refuse to acknowledge the ongoing crackdown on dissent and freedom of speech in Sri Lanka because they want to send asylum seekers back.  "Crimes against humanity are going on in Sri Lanka and it is unacceptable that Australia is turning its back on the victims including those seeking asylum."
