 Minister for Immigration and Border Protection 

 Scott Morrison 

 No Illegal Boat Arrivals To Australia For More Than Four Weeks 

 17-01-2014 -  

 The latest Operation Sovereign Borders weekly update reveals that it has now been more than  four weeks since the last people who arrived illegally by boat in Australian territory were  transferred to Australian immigration authorities according the Minister for Immigration and  Border Protection, Hon Scott Morrison.  

 Minister Morrison said “with no-one who has arrived illegally by boat being transferred to  Australian immigration authorities since December 19, this is the first time in more than five  years that this has occurred at this time of the year”. 

 “We welcome these results but understand that there is still a long way to go. I want to assure  the Australian people that despite the unintentional entry of Australian border protection  assets into Indonesian territorial waters, our operations that are stopping the boats will  continue.” 

 “People smugglers often seek to take advantage of the media reporting and commentary of  incidents like these to suggest to would be passengers that there will be a change of policy.  There will be no change of policy. We will simply be making sure that there will be full  operational compliance with our policies to stop the boats.” 

 “The failure of people smuggling ventures and the commitment of the Australian  Government to continue to implement the strong policies that are working is the worst news  people smugglers could hope to hear,” Mr Morrison said. 

 The weekly Operation Sovereign Borders statement on arrivals, transfers and processing  centre populations is attached.
