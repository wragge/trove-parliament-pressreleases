 R E FU G E E  BLOW OUT CONTINUES U N A B A T E D

 Huge numbers of refugee claims are being made by made many illegal entrants from  within Australia.

 U p to 23,000 applications could now be on hand.

 Senate Estimates reveal that as at September 15 1991 a total o f 22,000 applications had  been received. In August the number o f claims stood at 17,000 with the department  asserting that this number would reach only 20,000 by December. Departmental caseload  figures reveal that over 15,700 have been received from the PRC nationals. (See attached  table).

 As over 25,000 PRC nationals arrived after the Tienanmen Square massacre, and only  2,000 are thought to have returned, another possible 8,000 applications for refugee status  from PRC nationals could eventuate.

 More alarming however is the advice that notwithstanding the very considerable  resources allocated to this task, of those cases finalised in 1990/91, 10.5% (54) of cases  were approved for the grant of refugee status. Of the other cases, 39.5% (204) were  refused refugee status at the end of the primary processing stage and 50% (257) were 

 lapsed, withdrawn or approved in principle for resident status under other provisions in  the Act.

 O f the 204 refused entry at the first stage, procedures then envisage a second review.  However only 15% of the total departmental resources for refugee preocessing are  allocated to this review function. Thus a huge review backlog will continue unabated for 

 many years

 The department has disclosed that it will take nine months to process an application for  refugee status to the end of the review stage. But this will only occur after the existing  backlog o f applications has been cleared.

 There is no prospect of this backlog being cleared with present resource priorities.

 The Opposition has warned of the breakdown in Australia's ability to control entry  through abuse o f the refugee protection procedure.

 Information provided to the Senate suggests a problem far worse than claimed by the  opposition or admitted by the Government.

 It is not the practice of the Government to publish specific  statistics where small numbers are involved, as this may lead  to the identification of individual applicants. This could  result in harm to such individuals or their relatives in their  source country and thus could be in breach of Australia's  obligations under the 1951 Convention and 1967.Protocol 

 relating to the Status of Refugees.
