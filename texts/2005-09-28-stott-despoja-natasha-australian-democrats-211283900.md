 ACT youth need more services: Poll

 Many ACT youth worry about the lack of services directed at them, Senator Natasha  Stott Despojas annual Youth Poll survey has revealed. Senator Stott Despoja has expressed concern that such a large number (71%) feel  they are missing out on services.  "Young peoples access to services such as counselling and support groups is critical  for maintaining their health and wellbeing," Senator Stott Despoja said. Youth Poll 2005 also revealed many young peoples lives are touched by suicide, with  more than half of respondents knowing someone who had attempted or committed  suicide. Other major issues for young people this year include: increased university fees  (65% say increased HECS fees will discourage them from attending university);  reconciliation (71% believe the Government should enter into a treaty with  Indigenous Australians); and, access to contraception (80% want young people to  have access to free birth control).  "A significantly higher percentage of respondents than last year (60% compared to  42%) do not support the mandatory detention of asylum seekers.  "For more than a decade, Youth Poll has provided young people with a forum to  express their views on a range of topics.  "Through Youth Poll, young peoples views are publicised in the media and reported  to Parliament," Senator Stott Despoja said. Other State-specific findings include: an overwhelming 85% of New South Wales  respondents do not want a night curfew for P-platers; 74% of South Australian  respondents do not support the impounding of cars playing loud music or doing  burnouts; and, 68% of respondents from Western Australia reject increasing the  school leaving age.
