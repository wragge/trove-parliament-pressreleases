 Work For The Dole - Learning Farming And Working With Refugees

 Turning a school farm into a learning centre and helping refugees with accommodation and getting to know their new environment are among the new Work for the Dole projects announced this month.

 The Employment Services Minister, Mal Brough, today announced 199 new places for unemployed job seekers in 35 new Work for the Dole projects across Tasmania.

 'Work for the Dole offers two key benefits - worthwhile up-to-date work experience for unemployed people, which is what employers want, and a project outcome that benefits the participants’ local communities by way of new or upgraded services and facilities,' Mr Brough said.

 'Project sponsors tailor their activities to suit local needs - the needs of the participants and the needs of the local community. So Work for the Dole is a mutually beneficial scheme.'

 Project sponsors include a wide range of charitable and community groups.

 Among the new projects are:

 Redeveloping the Burnie High School farm to turn it into a centre for learning about farming. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Helping in refugee orientation and accommodation activities with the Migrant Resource Centre in Launceston. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Transcribing historical records, held by the Penitentiary Chapel historic site and Archives Office of Tasmania, from card indexes and microfilm into an electronic format in Bellerive. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Assisting the operations of the Royal Guide Dogs Association in Launceston and Devonport. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Providing computer education in Ulverstone, Latrobe, Smithton and Penguin. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Helping with awareness-raising of mental health issues with the Tasmanian Association for Mental Health in Hobart. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Maintaining IT equipment at the Ridgley Online Access Centre. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Organic fruit and vegetable growing and worm faming in New Town. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Improving the Dasher River environment around Sheffield, Barrington, Kimberley and Railton. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Restoring the historical Semaphore rail line at Mount Direction. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 This month’s new projects bring the total number in Tasmania to 485 since Work for the Dole began in late-1997. The projects have provided places for 5552 unemployed Tasmanians.
