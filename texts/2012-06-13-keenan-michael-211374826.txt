 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 13 BOATS IN 12 DAYS CONFIRMS LABOR IS  THE PROBLEM June 13, 2012

 The arrival of two more illegal boats, with a total of over 100 people on board, confirms that Labor is the problem on our borders, no matter what policies they say they want to implement, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "The  arrival  of  13  boats  in  just  12  days  means  more  than  800  people  have  arrived  this  month,  more  than  the  entire Malaysia people swap quota in less than two weeks," Mr Morrison said. 

 "People  smugglers  are  delivering  a  ringing  endorsement  of  Labor’s  failure  on  our  borders  and  now  word  is  spreading   across the world with boats reportedly leaving from India. People smugglers know the government are a soft touch and lack the necessary resolve to stop the boats no matter what policies they say they want to implement," he said. 

 "It’s  not  just  Labor’s  failed  policies  that  are  the  problem  any  more,  it  is  the  Labor  Government  themselves.  Labor  have become their own pull factor for illegal boat arrivals, regardless of their policies. 

 "Labor  have  lost  so  much  credibility  and  authority  on  these  issues  that  it  is  increasingly  unlikely  that  they  can  now  do anything to turn this around. Only a change of government can set this right. 

 "People smugglers already know they can easily exhaust the quota of Labor’s failed Malaysia people swap in less than  two weeks and they know that Labor won’t reinstate the Coalition’s strong border protection policies. Even if they did, it is  no longer clear they would have the same impact if implemented by a soft Labor Government that noâone will believe. 

 "This government just keeps giving people smugglers more incentives, whether it is their tick and flick approach for boat arrivals,  giving  suspected  people  smugglers  permanent  visas  and  then  letting  them  out  of  the  country  or  their  autopilot response to every arrival of making excuses rather than taking action. This government is the problem," Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr Keenan said: "Yet another two boats intercepted under Labor’s soft border protection policies, as this rapid influx has  bought 819 people illegally to Australia in the last month alone â showing no signs of slowing whilst the Gillard  Government remains in power. 

 "Clearly Labor’s failed border protection policies have offered no deterrent to people smugglers, as 7 boats have been  intercepted in 5 days. 

 "The recent incidents in which the AFP were required to take on the role of intercepting illegal boat arrivals, highlights the  desperate state of our overworked and under resourced Border Protection Command, who are struggling to cope with the  constant stream of arrivals. 

 "This Government is severely damaging Australia’s regional reputation as tough on border protection and our ability to  effectively combat people smuggling," Mr Keenan said.
