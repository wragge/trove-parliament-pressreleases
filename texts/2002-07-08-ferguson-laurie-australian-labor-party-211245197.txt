 HELP FOR REFUGEES WANTING

 Worrying problems being experienced by agencies delivering initial settlement services to refugees and humanitarian settlers are becoming increasingly evident. The Federal Government must urgently address the situation as part of its announced evaluation of the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS).

 Feedback to the Opposition suggests that the implementation of the IHSS, which began in March 1999, has been haphazard and has resulted in the loss of many dedicated volunteers across the country.

 The IHSS is designed to help refugee and humanitarian arrivals with information, assistance with accommodation and basic material requirements, and personal support to assist them to settle in the community. Holders of temporary protection visas are ineligible for most forms of IHSS assistance.

 The program involves seven separate forms of assistance, each with their own guidelines and procedures. Those humanitarian arrivals who are sponsored to Australia by a relative or friend are ineligible for some program elements.

 One of the principles of the IHSS is supposed to be that services to humanitarian arrivals are provided in a coordinated way that minimises gaps and duplication. On the ground the reality is that the Government has let 37 separate contracts for the program, involving multiple agencies, with differing starting times.  The result is a service system that is very complex and excessively dependent on the efforts of the individual agencies to achieve satisfactory outcomes for clients.

 The program is particularly failing to retain the goodwill of volunteer groups who have a long track record of helping refugees. The number of registered Community Support for Refugees (CSR) groups across Australia has fallen from 256 in November 1999 to just 104 now. CSR volunteers feel the Government does not value them. They are frustrated by the program’s red tape and by restrictions on the assistance they can provide.

 On top of this the Government has just let the contract for IHSS service support, to provide support and training to IHSS service providers, a full two years after the program commenced. It is ludicrous that service providers have been expected to operate for so long without access to such assistance.

 Agencies are also concerned that DIMIA increasingly seeks to make sponsors responsible for helping humanitarian migrants negotiate their way through Australia’s complex welfare, employment and training systems. Many sponsors are themselves from a non-English speaking background and have no welfare training. Yet the current application form asks them to provide new arrivals with access to employment, education and training services, income support, housing, Medicare and other health services, childcare, banking services, transport, translating and interpreter services and other settlement services.

 Government policy on temporary protection visas has clearly created an added burden for church and other welfare agencies, and for State and Territory Governments. Problems being experienced with the IHSS have added to this burden. There is a strong sense that the Government is not listening to those dealing with the day-to-day realities of settlement issues. It is essential that these concerns be addressed by whoever wins the tender to conduct the IHSS evaluation.
