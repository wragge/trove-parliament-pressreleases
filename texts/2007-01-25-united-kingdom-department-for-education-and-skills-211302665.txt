 JOHNSON SAYS PUPILS NEED TO LEARN OUR HISTORY TO UNDERSTAND BRITISH  VALUES IN CITIZENSHIP CLASSES 

 25 January 2007  

 

 Teenagers will learn British history in new-style classes which put understanding core British  values at the heart of Citizenship teaching.  

 Education Secretary Alan Johnson today said he accepted the key recommendation of a  major independent report that a strong focus on understanding our history was essential to  building community cohesion.   He believes it is vital that children learn about events and themes which have shaped the  country we are today, including Commonwealth, Empire and universal suffrage. It is vital that  in today’s diverse society children also need to be able to discuss their own identity and  respect that of others.   Mr Johnson said:   “I welcome Sir Keith’s report and want schools to play a leading role in creating greater  community cohesion. By helping children continue to understand difference, schools can  make a difference.   “Young people need to be engaged in this important debate because the values our children  learn at school will shape the kind of country Britain becomes.   “I think that this report marks the coming of age of Citizenship as an important part of the  national curriculum.”   Following Sir Keith’s findings, Mr Johnson proposed a new strand to Citizenship classes that  pupils take between 11 and 16. He accepts Sir Keith’s key recommendation that there should  be a new theme of ‘Identity and Diversity: Living together in the UK’, with a focus on the  historical understanding of issues that shaped British life today and discussing shared values.   The main new elements in Citizenship will be:    encouraging critical thinking about ethnicity, religion and race, withâ£ an explicit link to  political issues and values;    using contemporary history to illustrate thinking on contemporaryâ£ issues related to  citizenship; and    an understanding of the make-up of the UK, immigration, Commonwealthâ£ and Empire, the  European Union and extending the franchise.   Mr Johnson will ask the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to include this extra element  in Citizenship Education in the revised secondary curriculum proposals they are due to  publish and consult on.   Sir Keith’s review group believe that children can be taught core British values such as  tolerance, freedom of speech and justice. Their report includes a series of recommendations  aimed at improving community cohesion and helping children understand both diversity and  their own identity in today’s Britain.   The report says all schools should be actively involved in helping pupils get the skills they  need to take part in an active, inclusive democracy within five years.   Sir Keith Ajegbo, a respected former headteacher, said:   “It is the duty of all schools to address issues of ‘how we live together’ and ‘dealing with  difference’, however difficult and controversial they may seem.   “This report affects schools across the country, regardless of their ethnic make-up and issues  have to be dealt with in the context of the school and its neighbourhood. It is important they 

 consider issues that have shaped UK society today and understand them through the lens of  history.”   The report gives examples of good practice found by the review team and makes  recommendations on improvements to teacher training and the curriculum which will aid the  way diversity and citizenship are taught.   Mr Johnson also accepted the following key recommendations:   â¢ that pupils should be able to take a full two-year GCSE in Citizenship and also an A level in  the subject (Citizenship is the fastest growing GCSE with numbers of pupils taking it 

 increasing by 42%);   â¢ there should be a national ”Who we think we are” week which will be the starting point for  schools to launch local projects, cultural celebration, debates on identity and values - this  would be an annual ongoing event; and   â¢ that schools should be active in “twinning” with other schools of different ethnic, cultural,  social and religious backgrounds so children can meet and work together on various  activities.   The review group found some trailblazing examples of good practice on diversity. Sir Keith’s  team wants schools across the country to follow the good example of communities in Oldham  and Bradford following the 2001 riots. Primary schools forged links by twinning between  schools representative of different communities. For example a rural mainly white school  linked up with an urban mainly Asian school and they shared experiences through meeting  and joint curriculum studies.   Royton and Crompton School in Oldham contributed to community cohesion by working with  the Spirit of Enniskillen in Northern Ireland and using their expertise to set up a Shared  Futures programme involving young people giving workshops in local schools on dealing with  difference.   The report also found that many white working class boys and girls have a negative  perception of their British identity and can feel as disenfranchised as non-white pupils. It says  as much thought and resources needs to be put into providing diversity education to white  pupils as to ethnic minority groups.   The report was commissioned after concern about growing extremism and division in society  after the London terrorist bombings. The review consisted of interviews with more than 100  stakeholder groups (including Trades Unions, the CRE, the Refugee Council) and visits to  dozens of schools in communities up and down the country. Children from a range of ethnic  groups were interviewed about what they thought of the citizenship lessons. Keith Ajegbo was  headteacher at Deptford Green School, located in a deprived London borough with a large  African community.
