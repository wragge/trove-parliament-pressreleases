 LOOK AT WHOLE IMMIGRATION PICTURE: DEMOCRATS

 Senator Jean J e n kins, Australian Democrats spokesperson on   Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, called today for a widening   of the immigration debate.

 "It is right and proper that Australians should be debating   the i m m i g r a t i o n  issue," said S en a t o r  Jenkins. "While the   Australian Democrats reject the crude racist criteria   endorsed by the Coalition leaders, we would encourage  

 rational debate on the issue.

 "Rational debate does not include the making of decisions   based on race or skin colour. It is precisely because of this   that South Africa, with its racially based legislation, is   ostracised."

 R e f e r r i n g  to remarks made in Pe r t h  by the leader of the  

 National Party, Mr Sinclair, Senator Jenkins said that   Australia deserved a better class of politician.

 Sena to r Jenkins, who is convening a public meeting in Perth   to oppose a racially discriminatory immigration policy, said   t h at  there were a number of r e l ated issues w h i c h  must be  

 considered: Â« .

 . The rate of unemployment in Australia . The need for training and r e t r a i n i n g  A us t r a l i a ' s   workforce . The recognition and upgrading of overseas  

 gualifications _

 . The method of operation of of overseas offices of the   Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs _

 . The numbers of immigrants subsequently leaving  

 Australia, and reasons why _

 . The numbers of A u s t r a l i a n s  leaving A u s t r a l i a ,  and   reasons why . The methodology of the Business Migration Scheme   . Illegal immigration

 . The maintenance of the family reunion programme, and   Australia's international obligation to help refugees.

 Senator Jenkins has called on "the humane elements of Western   Australian public opinion" to support the public meeting in   P e r t h  at 8.00 p.m. on Thursday 18th A u g u s t . (Venue to be  

 advertised).
