 Media Release 9 September, 2016 

 

 One year on, Government falls short of promise to Syrian and Iraqi refugees   

 The Government needs to allocate more resources to deliver on its pledge to bring an additional  12,000 refugees from conflict in Syria and Iraq, Greens Immigration spokesperson Nick McKim  says.   

 “It is exactly twelve months since Tony Abbott pledged to take in 12,000 people from the Syrian  conflict, one of his few decent acts as Prime Minister,” Senator McKim said.  “One  year  on,  only  around  a  quarter  of  the  12  000  allocated  places  have  actually  arrived in  Australia.   

 “This stands in stark contrast to Canada, which has resettled 25,000 people since November,  while the United States is looking to resettle 11,000 in the next three months.   

 “Malcolm  Turnbull  and  his  hapless  Immigration  Minister  Peter  Dutton  are  failing  people  in  desperate need, and should instruct their agencies to immediately allocate extra resources to  speed up assessments and processing.   

 “Mr Turnbull and Mr Dutton need to show the same urgency and compassion as other world  leaders like Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau,” said Senator McKim.   

 Senator Di Natale said that we have a responsibility and duty of care as a compassionate country  to take in people who are seeking refuge.   

 "Another broken promise from the Turnbull government that will leave a generation of people  broken and without desperately needed refuge.   

 "How cruel is Malcolm Turnbull that he can't honour the only kind act his party has pledged in  support of people seeking asylum,” Senator Di Natale said.
