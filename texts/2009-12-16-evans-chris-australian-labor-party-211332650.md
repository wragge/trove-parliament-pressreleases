 Government committed to mandatory  detention on Christmas Island 

 Wednesday, 16 December 2009 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris  Evans, today reiterated the Government's commitment to  mandatory detention and offshore processing of irregular maritime  arrivals on Christmas Island.  

 The Government rejects many of Amnesty International's claims  which follow its recent visit to Christmas Island. Irregular maritime  arrivals are receiving fair and humane treatment and Australia is  not in breach of its international obligations. 

 Senator Evans said these policies were essential components of  strong border control and important elements in ensuring the  integrity of Australia's immigration program.  

 When announcing the government's key immigration detention  values, the Minister made clear that the values would apply on  Christmas Island to the full extent possible within the  government's excision and non-statutory refugee status  processing arrangements - and that commitment is being met.  

 While there is no statutory obligation to process asylum claims on  Christmas Island within a particular timeframe, the vast majority of  claims are being dealt with in about 100 days. Those who have  been detained longer are still undergoing the comprehensive  health, identity and security checking process. 

 No unaccompanied minor has been accommodated on Christmas  Island for six months and the Government ensures priority  processing for them, with the average processing time for  unaccompanied minors being about 90 days. 

 It is Rudd Government policy that no child be held in an  immigration detention centre. The low-security construction camp,  where some children are housed on Christmas Island, is not an  immigration detention centre and it has appropriate recreational  facilities. 

 All people in immigration detention are provided with access to a  range of health services, including mental health care,  commensurate to those available to the broader Australian  community. 

 In line with this Government's commitment to transparency and  accountability, Amnesty International visited Christmas Island with  the full assistance of the Department of Immigration and  Citizenship (DIAC).
