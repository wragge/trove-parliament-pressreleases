 TONY ABBOTT:    

 For Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan, the surplus wasn’t just a forecast, it was a fact. If you go to the Prime  Minister’s McKell lecture as recently as July, the surplus wasn’t something that might happen it was  something that had happened. So this thing that was a fact just a very short time ago has now been dumped  and what this demonstrates is that you just can’t trust this government to manage the economy and you just  can’t trust this government to tell the truth.   

 Now, this is a government which doesn’t have an economic strategy, it simply has a political strategy as  demonstrated by this attempt to dump the surplus commitment on the eve of Christmas and hope that people  somehow won’t notice that yet again this government has betrayed a fundamental commitment. This  government before the last election made two solemn covenants with the Australian people. The first was  that there would be no carbon tax under the government I lead, dumped within weeks of the election. The  second, there would be surplus. Remember Julia Gillard’s own words, “No ifs, no buts, it will happen.” She  said that the day after she made the no carbon tax commitment. Now, this second solemn commitment, this  second covenant with the Australian people dumped. So this is a government which you simply can’t trust.  You can’t trust it on anything. You can’t trust it on the Budget, you can’t trust it on borders, you can’t trust  it with the truth. You simply cannot trust this government. You simply cannot trust this Prime Minister.    

 Now, if I may be economic for a moment, this surplus is not just some fine point of economic theory. This is  not just a fetish of economic rationalists. As the Government has been saying for three years now, the  delivery of the surplus is “absolutely vital” for the long term welfare of the Australian people. It’s  “absolutely vital”. The Prime Minister has said many times, the Treasurer has said many times in order to  reduce cost of living pressures on Australian families and now by the Government’s own admission, by the  Government’s own statements, cost of living pressures will be increased because of the Government’s  failure to deliver on the promised surplus. When it comes to the economy this is a government which just  doesn’t get it.   

 It fails to understand any of the fundamentals of economic management. We know this because we know its  record. This is a government of high spending, new taxes and more regulation. Spending is $100 billion a  year more now than it was just five years ago. We’ve got two major new taxes - the carbon tax and the 

 2 

 

 mining tax. We’ve got 20,000 more regulations than we had five years ago despite the government’s  promise of one in, one out. So this is a government which has completely failed on economic management.  Completely, absolutely and utterly failed. Now for three years they’ve been boasting of this surplus. For  three years they’ve been saying that this surplus was the badge of their economic credibility. Well they don’t  have it anymore, they don’t have it anymore. I want to stress, this is a fundamental failure from the  Government. It’s a failure of competency, it’s a failure of trust, it is every bit as big a failure as the failure on  the carbon tax. We will pursue this government every single day until the next election on its failure to  deliver a surplus.   

 I’m going to ask Joe to say a few words and then I’ll take some questions, but before I do let me say that this  humiliating, embarrassing, nervous announcement by Wayne Swan today completely vindicates what the  Shadow Treasurer has been saying for three years, that they would never ever deliver a surplus. Well Joe,  you are absolutely and totally vindicated.   

 JOE HOCKEY:   

 Thanks very much Tony. And I’m sad in the sense that I am because as you said, this was a fundamental  commitment by the Government. It was a solemn commitment in 2010 that the Government would deliver a  surplus this year. They set the benchmark. This is their words and there was no qualification in the lead up to  the 2010 election. The Government said on numerous occasions that it was going to deliver this surplus in  2012/13. Let me give you some of the quotes.  Julia Gillard to Laurie Oakes in 2010, Gillard: “The Budget  will be back in the black, back in surplus in 2012/13.” Oakes: “Guaranteed?” Gillard: “Yes. The Budget is  coming back to surplus Laurie in 2012/13 as promised.”    

 Wayne Swan, three days before the last election: “Well we’re getting back into surplus in three years,  Kochie.” Koch: “Ok, come hell or high water?” Treasurer:  “Come hell or high water.”   

 So the overblown promises, the use of extreme language without qualification proves that these people are  not fit to govern the economy. The Prime Minister in 2011: “My commitment to a surplus in 2012/13 was a  promise made and it will be honoured.”  No qualifications, all the excuses that Wayne Swan talks about -  falling commodity prices, a high Australian  Dollar, nominal growth not being up to standard. Somehow the  GFC is ongoing all the time.    

 I mean, none of these excuses were used when they made these solemn promises and of course it was Julia  Gillard who said you can’t run this country if you can’t manage its budget. Well damn right. It’s the Labor  Party that said in 2008, it was going to have a temporary deficit. Now Wayne Swan says he cannot deliver a  surplus this year because he has a temporary shortfall in revenue. The revenue shortfall he has identified is  one per cent of this year’s revenue - one per cent. So what they’ve been doing is they’ve been doing  everything they possibly can to try and meet the politics but not the economics.   

 The bottom line is Labor can’t hold back on the waste, no matter what it is. $6 billion wasted on border  protection, all the carbon programmes that they’ve wasted so much money on, $900 cheques to dead people,  the BER is still being rolled out. It is the waste that is part of Labor. It’s the way they operate. It is not in the  Labor party’s DNA to ever live within your means, but the tragedy of it all is that the debt is going to  continue to grow. Wayne Swan promised solemnly earlier this year, it wouldn’t go passed $250 billion,  today it’s $256 billion. By having a deficit this year it is going to go higher. It means our children have to  repay the money. It means that they’re going to have a greater burden than what we’ve had. We gave to  Labor a government that had no net debt, it had money in the bank. And we, if we are elected next year, are  facing over $250 billion of debt that we have to raise from the Australian community to pay back for  Labor’s waste and mismanagement.   

 So yes, we are upset about this. The Australian people will rightly be upset about this. Taking out the  garbage five minutes before Christmas is the way the Labor Party operates. They’re treating the Australian  people with contempt. They think the Australian people over summer will forget the solemn promises. Well 

 3 

 

 we will not forget the solemn promises made by Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan. Enough is enough. They are  the most incompetent government Australians have ever had. They are the most incompetent economic  managers Australia has ever had and it’s their own benchmarks that they’re breaking and they deserve, they  deserve every bit of criticism they get and more.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, forgetting the overblown rhetoric of the Government, as you call it, economists across the board  said it’s the responsible thing to do.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, it is never responsible for a government to make promise after promise after promise and then break  the promise. It’s not responsible for a government to lose control of its own spending. Everywhere you look  you see examples of this government spending like a drunken sailor. Just to give you the latest example in  the papers this morning they have taken a 15 year lease, a 15 year lease over the Department of Climate  Change. What responsible government does something like this?   

 QUESTION:   

 Isn’t it a bit disingenuous to say you’re upset when it’s really given you a golden opportunity to do what  you’re doing now?   

 JOE HOCKEY:   

 Can I answer that question just about the economists just a little bit earlier? The economists look at the total  economy, naturally that’s what they do. But the economists were also highly critical of the Government’s  waste, the waste on the BER, the waste on computers in schools. The waste from this government is one of  the reasons why the starting position this year should be a surplus. It’s because they have wasted so much  money to date and they keep making promises. If there is any revenue shortfall it is because Wayne Swan  promised to introduce a mining tax that was going to raise billions of dollars and it is hardly raising a dollar.  He was the personal architect of it with Julia Gillard. They didn’t have Treasury officials in the room. They  negotiated a mining tax that hardly raises a dollar. The problem is they committed $15 billion of expenditure  against a mining tax that was always going to be volatile and it was always going to be incredibly exposed to  volatility and commodity prices. Now when the first mining tax came out we said it would be a bullet to the  head of the mining industry and we were right and the mining industry reacted. And then when the new  mining tax was developed we said at the time, it’s hardly going to raise a dollar, but the Government ignored  our advice and now you can see it come to roost with the Budget running into deficit, particularly because  the mining industry isn’t able to pay the taxes that the Government has spent.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 And look a competent government would never be in this situation. Let’s go back to 2004/05 when  unemployment was about five per cent. The Howard Government delivered a surplus of 1.5 per cent of GDP  with terms of trade 40 per cent lower than last year when this government delivered a deficit of over three  per cent of GDP. So, let’s be absolutely crystal clear, this is a government that is an utterly incompetent  economic manager and that is why we are in this predicament.   

 QUESTION:   

 [Inaudible] what would you cut now?   

 

 

 4 

 

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well the fact is that this is a government which has spending at almost $100 billion a year more now than  five years ago. This government doesn’t have a revenue problem, this government has a spending problem.   

 QUESTION:   

 Which programmes would you cut? Which specifically?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 As I have said all along, we will announce our fiscal commitments in good time before the next election but  we made an announcement just a few weeks ago that would save $1.3 billion. We are not going to go ahead  with the increase in the refugee and humanitarian intake to 20,000 and that will save $1.3 billion over the  forward estimates.   

 QUESTION:   

 If you win the election next year, how soon will you return the Budget to surplus?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 What we have said is that based on the current figures there will be a surplus in every year of an incoming  Coalition government. Now, I noticed that the Treasurer today told us that there wasn’t going to be a surplus  but he didn’t update the figures and I think really he must have new figures from the Treasury and the  sooner he releases them the better for everyone, not just for this year but for next year because let’s not  forget that next year’s claimed surplus of just over $2 billion is based on a $5 billion tax bring-forward,  which is one of the reasons why we said that this government wasn’t going to deliver an honest surplus this  year or any other year.   

 QUESTION:   

 Do you commit to delivering a surplus even if market economists, business leaders and others are strongly  recommending that you don’t, that it’s bad for the economy to do so?    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, our commitment is unchanged given that the figures are unchanged and the point that I keep making  is that Australia will always be in a stronger fiscal position under the Coalition then under the ALP because  what we will do is put in place the economic reforms that will make the economy grow more strongly and  again, people say Labor’s delivered economic growth, look at the GDP per head figures. Under the Howard  Government GDP per head grew at well over two per cent a year, under the current government GDP per  head has limped along at about a half a per cent a year.   

 QUESTION:   

 Is a future Coalition government committed to delivering consecutive surpluses? Is that something you want  to achieve all the time?   

 JOE HOCKEY:   

 We have a four point plan which Tony and I have talked about at length. Number one, we will live within  our means and we will get rid of the waste, and that is hugely important because Wayne Swan can blame the  high Australian dollar - have a look at his speech in the last Budget where he said that the people that are 

 5 

 

 going to be hurt most by meandering back to surplus are pensioners and people most vulnerable - he said it.  The cost of living will go up if you don’t get back to surplus. He said it, his words on Budget night. Now,  from our perspective - number one, live within your means; number two, get rid of the carbon and mining  taxes; number three, grow productivity with our six point plan; and number four, proper engagement with  Asia. Our four point plan can deliver prosperity, deliver stability and certainty. We are not going to deliver  overblown rhetoric and set bench marks that cannot be met and the Government fails to meet them.   

 QUESTION:   

 Do you expect now that this surplus straightjacket has been removed that the Government will now embark  on a spending spree to pay for promises in education and disability reform?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, the point I make is that this is a government without an economic strategy, it just has a political  strategy. This is a government which obviously wants to buy the next election by mortgaging every  Australian’s future. Right now, thanks to the spending spree of this government every single Australian man,  woman and child is saddled with about $7,000 each in government debt that we didn’t have. We had net  assets, now we’ve got $7,000 each in net government debt as a result of this government. So, I think it is  absolutely clear that this is a government which is going to try to buy its way back into office. This is a  government which is acting like a tenant trashing the house before it gets evicted. They are mortgaging  everyone’s future to try to secure their re-election.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, have you now read the judgment in the failed Peter Slipper case?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Yes I have and I absolutely stand by Mal Brough. Thank you.
