 ADD FOR VICTIMS OF THE FORGOTTEN CONFLICT IN AFGHANISTAN

 Australia will assist victims of the forgotten conflict in Afghanistan by contributing $3.6 million for  relief and rehabilitation programs, the Minister for Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney, said  today.

 "The outbreak of heavy factional fighting in Kabul early last year exacerbated an already highly  unstable security situation," Mr Bilney said. "Hundreds of thousands of people fled the capital,  rehabilitation efforts have been disrupted and the repatriation of refugees has slowed to a trickle. There  are now some 300,000 displaced people in camps at Jalalabad alone dependent on international 

 assistance, while outside the country there are still up to three million refugees in neighbouring Iran and  Pakistan.

 "Australia has not forgotten the Afghan people even though their plight is no longer in the public eye. In fact since 1980 Australia has provided around $85 million in assistance including almost 290,000  tonnes of Australian food aid."

 Under today's announcement 8,000 tonnes of Australian wheat, valued at $2.5 million, will be provided  to the World Food Programme. The wheat will be used for free distribution and food-for-work  activities for refugees in Pakistan.

 The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan will  receive $400,000 towards a highly successful mine clearance program so that refugees can return to  those regions of the country that have remained relatively peaceful. Australia has provided funding to  the program for the last three years and until late 1993 provided a contingent of army engineers 

 involved in technical, advisory and monitoring functions.

 UNICEF Australia will receive $400,000 for emergency water and sanitation to meet the urgent needs  of 50,000 people at a new camp at Jalalabad. If security allows, UNICEF will also provide assistance  to displaced people around Kabul as part of a strategy to discourage further movement to the camps.

 The International Committee of the Red Cross will receive $200,000 for its work in .Afghanistan. The Red Cross is one of the few humanitarian agencies to continue operating in Kabul through the  conflict and is providing an invaluable sendee to the Afghan people. It provides assistance to surgical  hospitals in Kabul and Jalalabad, clinics and first-aid posts, trains Afghans in war surgery techniques 

 and runs an orthopaedic centre producing artificial limbs for mine victims.

 AUSTCARE will receive $98,000 for an education and literacy project to prepare refugees in Pakistan  for their eventual return to their homeland.
