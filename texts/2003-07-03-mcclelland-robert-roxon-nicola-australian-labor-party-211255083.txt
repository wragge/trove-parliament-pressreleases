 Bungled surveillance shows need for Coastguard   

 The  Howard  Government’s  bungling  of  coastal  surveillance  shows  the  need   for Labor’s plan for an Australian Coastguard.   

 According to reports today, the Howard Government knew last month of an  impending unauthorised boat arrival, but failed to provide coastal authorities  with sufficient resources to search two known possible routes.   

 The  boat  was  reportedly  allowed  to  come  as  close  as  ten  minutes  from  the   Australian  mainland,  exposing  the  Howard  Government’s  claims  to  have   secured Australia’s borders as a myth.   

 Yesterday’s  weak  denials  by  Howard  Government  Ministers  raise  more   questions than they answer about this clear failure of coastal surveillance.   

 The  surveillance  failure  comes  shortly  after  the  Howard  Government  was   caught out secretly cutting back border patrols under Operation Relex.   

 For this boat to remain undetected until it was so close to the mainland shows  that  Australia  needs  Labor’s  plan  for  a  Coastguard  -  a  cop  on  the  beat  24   hours a day, 365 days a year.   

 Labor’s plan will see Australia protected by new, larger offshore patrol vessels,  purpose-built  for  border  protection,  capable  of  operating  right  out  to   Christmas Island and the Indian Ocean territories.   

 Australians  deserve  better  than  the  Howard  Government’s  bungling  and   policy  on  the  run.   Only  a  Federal  Labor  Government  will  secure  Australia’s   borders with a Coastguard.
