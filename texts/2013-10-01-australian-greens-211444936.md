 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Tuesday, 1 October 2013   

 Tony Abbott’s smoke and mirrors asylum road-show rolls on   

 After stamping his feet in opposition about tow-backs, buy-backs and transit ports on Indonesian soil  Tony Abbott is now refusing to be upfront with the Australian people about the implementation of  his policies, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “All we are getting from Tony Abbott is vague back-peddling from the ridiculous fervour of his fear  fuelled election campaign,” the Greens immigration spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said  today.   

 “Australia could have taken a suite of policies to Indonesia that would have cared for refugees while  saving lives at sea and protecting the crucial relationship with one of our closest neighbours. Instead  we have seen Tony Abbott desperately trying to smooth over the damage he caused during his  hysterical election campaign.   

 “Mr Abbott is still refusing to give the Australian people any information about his highly prized but  incredibly cruel refugee policies and that simply isn’t good enough.   

 “We have heard nothing from Tony Abbott about how Australia will help the people in Indonesia and  around the world who need protection and that is a terrible shame.”
