  KOSOVARS TO BE GIVEN TEMPORARY SAFE HAVEN IN AUSTRALIA

  

  “The Government has decided 
to activate its plans to provide safe haven in Australia for 400  0 displaced Kosovars”, Philip Ruddock, the Minister 
for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, announced today. This follows 
the receipt of a request, in the early hours of this morning, from the 
United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).

  

  Mr Ruddock said an eight person Australian team has 
been in the Former Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) for some weeks. It 
has been consulting actively with UNHCR on the arrangements that would 
apply if a request was reactivated for Australia to take displaced Kosovars. 
The team has also been assisting the UNHCR in registration and screening 
processes and providing technical support.

  

  “This team is now asking UNHCR to nominate individuals 
for processing to Australia and clearly we want this to happen as soon 
as possible" said Mr Ruddock. “Arrangements are already in place 
to send additional staff to Skopja to increase further our processing 
capacity."

  

  The Government announced on 6 April 1999 Australia's 
offer to provide temporary safe haven in Australia for 4,000 Kosovo 
Albanians. Mr Ruddock said that this offer had been put on hold on 10 
April 1999 at the request of the UNHCR.

  

  “Increasing outflows from Kosovo and continued 
pressure within the camps in FYROM have now resulted in the UNHCR requesting 
Australia and other countries outside Europe to provide safe haven".

  

  The legal framework for providing temporary safe 
haven in Australia is being put into place.   The Migration Legislation (Temporary 
Safe Haven Visas) Bill 1999  was passed yesterday by the Senate 
and will be considered by the House of Representatives in the Budget 
sitting.

  

  "Extensive preparations for reception in Australia 
are already in place. The first arrivals will be processed in East Hills 
in Sydney and travel to Brighton Barracks in Tasmania. A range of other 
sites throughout Australia will be deployed in the light of the composition 
and needs of the people concerned".

  

  Mr Ruddock expressed appreciation at the high level 
of cooperation between Federal and State bodies and community groups. 
1 think we are well prepared for the intense activity which will be 
necessary in coming days and weeks as many Australians work to welcome 
these people who have suffered so much and are now being offered temporary 
haven in Australia."
