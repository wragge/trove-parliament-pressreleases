 Congratulations to Australiaâ€™s first  Sudanese AFL rookie 

 16 December 2009 

 The Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and  Settlement Services, Laurie Ferguson, today congratulated Majak  Daw, the first player of Sudanese origin to be recruited in the  recent AFL rookie draft. 

 'Majak Daw was recruited by North Melbourne with its first-round  pick. I congratulate both Majak and the North Melbourne Football  Club on this momentous milestone,' Mr Ferguson said.  

 'Majak came to Australia as a refugee from war-torn Sudan. He  has surmounted incredible odds to not only overcome language  and cultural boundaries, but to excel in his chosen sport. 

 'Young pioneers such as Majak serve to inspire young people  from all backgrounds to follow their dreams. 

 'His example also highlights the importance of communities  getting behind their young people and helping them to realise their  full potential.' 

 Mr Ferguson said the outcome typified the strong cooperation  between the AFL and the settlement program run by the  Department of Immigration and Citizenship. 

 He praised the commitment of Daw's new club, North Melbourne,  in working with local communities. 

 'I congratulate North Melbourne Football Club for its work in  fostering social cohesion with the opening of their new Learning  and Life Centre,' Mr Ferguson said. 

 'In partnership with the Australian Multicultural Foundation and the  Scanlon Foundation, the Learning and Life Centre will be a hub for  local community.'
