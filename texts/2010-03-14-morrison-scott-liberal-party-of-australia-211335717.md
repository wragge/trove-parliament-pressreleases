 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship    Media Release 

 

 Illegal boat arrivals defy shift in global trends, as another boat arrives 

 Sunday 14th March 2010 

 

 The arrival of the 92nd boat following the Rudd Government’s wind back of the Coalition’s 

 strong border protection regime comes just days after the UNHCR reported that push factors 

 have been easing in Sri Lanka and Afghanistan, Shadow Minister for Immigration and 

 Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border 

 Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 

 “Just this week the UNHCR has been saying the global situation in places such as Sri Lanka 

 and Afghanistan have been improving in recent times, providing increasing opportunities for 

 those previously seeking asylum to return home,” Mr Morrison said. 

 

 “Yet over the same period we have seen an escalation in illegal boat arrivals under the Rudd 

 Government’s soft policies to the highest rate on record, more than 25% higher than it was 

 prior to the arrival of the Tampa,” he said. 

 

 “In 2010 we have had 24 boats and almost 1200 people illegally arrive in just 10 weeks. 

 

 “We have known for several months that the number of illegal arrivals from Sri Lanka has 

 been declining. The Government has refused to release this information, knowing that it 

 would undermine their spin about global push factors. 

 

 “There will always be a big market for people smugglers in our region, regardless of the 

 global situation. The issue is whether we give them a product to sell. 

 

 “Under the Rudd Government the people smugglers are doing a roaring trade. Under the 

 Coalition we drove their business into the ground. The difference between the approaches of 

 the two parties could not be starker,” he said. 

 

 Mr Keenan said: “Over the last 8 days, only two have been spared another boat arrival. 

 

 "This is an appalling record. The Rudd Labor Government is failing to protect Australia's 

 borders. 

 

 "Yet the Labor Government refuses to acknowledge they have a problem and have no will to 

 fix it,” he said.
