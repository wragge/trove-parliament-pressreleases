 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 STATEMENT BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THE HON SIMON CREAN MP

 Government’s Landmark Acceptance Of Opposition Asylum Seeker Amendment

 In a landmark development, Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock today accepted Labor’s solution for dealing with asylum seekers about to be brought to Australia following the collapse of the Howard Government’s “Pacific Solution”.

 Minister Ruddock’s decision came less than two hours after I put forward Labor’s proposal in amendments to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 2002, and offered to work with the Government in a bipartisan manner to develop a lasting and comprehensive solution to the problem of asylum seekers.

 As the attached letter shows, Mr Ruddock accepted one of Labor’s two key amendments, and agreed to consult on the other.

 No one who has been following the refugee debate for the last six months can mistake the importance of today’s decision by Minister Ruddock.

 The Government’s bill, and its acceptance of Labor’s amendment, is an admission that its so-called “Pacific Solution” is a failure.

 It was only ever a “solution” to deceive voters and get the Government past the election.

 Today’s decision by Minister Ruddock to accept Labor’s solution is a hopeful sign of an end to the government’s abuse of this issue for political gain, and a return to bipartisanship.

 Let’s hope it continues.
