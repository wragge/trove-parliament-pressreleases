 103 foreign crew go missing at Australian ports   

 Labor is very concerned by John Anderson’s admission that since July 2001, 103  crew members from foreign flagged vessels have going missing once they have  reached an Australian port.    

 103 missing foreign crew are 103 potential threats to Australia’s homeland  security. This is an open gate in our border protection regime that could be used  by terrorists or other dangerous criminals. 

 

 The fact that crew often went missing in groups of three or four is especially  concerning. There have been more foreign crew go missing from foreign flagged  vessels in Australian ports since July 10 2001 than there have been unauthorised 

 boat arrivals in the same period.   

 A significant number of these foreign crew members arrive in Australia without  face to face passport checks or other identification checks. This means that  foreign crew members can arrive in Australia, walk off the ship, and enter the  Australian community with no health check, no security checks, and no face to  face identification checks.   

 John Anderson has gone out of his way to make it easier for foreign ships to  trade in Australian ports. Unfortunately he has refused to make the commitment  to ensure security is upgraded to deal with the increasing number of foreign crew  members who have gone missing.  This lax attitude undermines Australia’  homeland security.   

 John Anderson must now explain why a significant number of foreign crew  members are allowed to enter Australia without identification checks, and why so  many foreign crew members have been allowed to simply go missing.
