  Democrats 
ensure protection of public hospitals

  Today, in the Senate, the 
Democrats secured the protection of the public health system from any 
revenue loss due   to the impact of the "Lifetime Health Cover" 
legislation.

  Under the existing Medicare Agreements the Commonwealth 
can ask for public hospital funding to be returned if private health 
fund membership rises above a specified level.

  "I am pleased that, in the context of the Lifetime 
Health Cover Bill 1999, the Government has listened to our concerns, 
and the concerns of consumers, regarding the need to protect public 
hospital funding, " said Democrats’ health spokesperson, Senator 
Meg Lees.

  "It has been of very great concern to the Democrats 
that the States and Territories risked losing Medicare funding if health 
fund membership increased, even if this resulted in a net loss of public 
hospital revenue.

  "In addition, I am pleased that many of the 
Senate Community Affairs Committee’s concerns have been addressed 
through our agreement with Government, notably the special consideration 
for migrants and refugees," said Senator Lees.

  "One of the major findings of the Committee 
was that gap payments were of far more serious concern to consumers 
than lifetime health cover.

  "The Government’s agreement to our proposal 
to develop a brochure on consumer rights in relation to gap payments, 
for distribution through the Medicare network, is a positive first step 
in addressing this issue. 

  "It will be of great benefit to consumers, many 
of whom find themselves facing large gap payments that they were not 
told about prior to consenting to treatment.

  "We are pleased that two of the major consumer 
complaints about private health insurance, undisclosed gaps and no reward 
for long term membership, are being addressed. We are particularly delighted 
that we have been able to protect public hospitals while also supporting 
this positive change for private health fund members," 

  "I welcome the Government’s agreement to protect 
public hospitals from the "clawback provisions" and their 
commitment to address the specific needs of refugees and migrants under 
the lifetime health cover scheme," concluded Senator Lees.
