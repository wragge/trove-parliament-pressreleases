 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  - PARLIAMENT  HOUSE, CANBERRA, WEDNESDAY, 22 JUNE 2005   

 SUBJECT: MIGRATION BILL, LAURIE FERGUSON, KIM  BEAZLEY, INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS CHANGES   

 JOURNALIST: If we can touch on immigration first.  You’re going to vote on  these Migration Bills, has Labor missed its opportunity to capitalise on divisions within  the Liberal Party on this?   

 

 SMITH: We’re making the point that to the extent that these changes are  incremental, we’ll support them.  It’s better than nothing.  But if you actually want to  make real improvements in this area, then the Government should simply adopt Labor’s  policy.   

 

 I made the point this morning when I made my own contribution to the debate, that if  Labor’s policy approach which we adopted in the last Parliament had been adopted by the  Government - an independent Inspector General, kids out of detention, 90% of people  processed within 90 days and a 30 day review after that, and changes to the TPV  arrangements, a lot of the scandals, a lot of the difficulties that we’ve seen wouldn’t have  occurred.   

 These changes don’t set the system up for the future in a proper way and that’s why we  say in the end given the ramshackle Department and the ramshackle approach of the  Minister, if you want to sort this out you’ve got to do it properly and do that with a Royal  Commission.   

 JOURNALIST: Is Laurie Ferguson handling this portfolio appropriately at the  moment?   

 SMITH: I simply refer to and repeat the comments the Leader made last night.  The  Leader’s got confidence in Laurie’s handling of it, he’s the relevant portfolio Shadow  Minister.   

 JOURNALIST: The Leader did say yesterday though that Laurie had revised his  position on Peter Qasim.  This morning Laurie was standing very much by that.  Is there  a difference here? 

 

 SMITH: I’m not proposing to add to the comments that Kim made about that  matter yesterday.  The Leader’s view on that matter is crystal clear.   

 JOURNALIST: There’s been some talk about Kim Beazley’s own personal  standing and whether or not he’s doing the job properly.  What do you think about that?   

 SMITH: I think he’s doing a very good job in difficult circumstances.  The first  twelve months after an election defeat are always difficult.  They are particularly difficult  when you stand up and make a point about fairness and fundamental principles.  We 

 knew when we made that decision on Budget night that we would lose some political  skin.    We wanted to make the point that we didn’t believe it was right or fair for 7 million  Australian employees to get $6 a week and for a very small number of tax payers at the  top end of town to get $65 a week plus the super surcharge.  We knew that that would  cause us some political difficulties.  But it was the right thing to do, it was the right thing  to then, it’s the right thing to do now.     

 I also make this point.  This is a long haul race.  This election will be in second half of  2007 and the fundamental living standards of the Australian community will be a central  issue in that.  The tax take of the Government up and wages down as a result of their  industrial relations changes. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Are we already seeing some unrest here now?  What do you make  of Robert Ray’s comments that people on the frontbench are a bunch of dills?   

 SMITH: Robert was making a comment about Senate tactics, that was as far as it  went.   

 JOURNALIST: Just to bring back to industrial relations.  Why is it so important to  be here today and who is going to lose out if these changes go ahead?   

 SMITH: Who will lose out will be Australian working families.  The people who  will suffer here will be Australian working families.  Their living conditions and their  working standards will be reduced.  This is all about reducing people’s wages, removing  their entitlements, removing their conditions, removing their safety nets and minimum  standards.  So who suffers out of these extreme unfair changes?  Working Australian  families, that’s who suffer.   

 JOURNALIST: You say with a downturn in the economy the effects will be  exacerbated.   

 SMITH: When I say to John Howard to give a guarantee that no one is going to be  worse off as a result of these changes, he says ‘my guarantee is my record and my record  is the state of the economy’.  Well, when I put to him his record on the Minimum Wage,  he has opposed every National Minimum Wage increase that the Commission has agreed  to since he came to office.     

 Working Australian families dependent upon the Minimum Wage would be $50 a week  or $2600 a year worse off, if he had had his way.  So his record stands there for all to see.   In difficult economic circumstances the people who suffer most are those people who are  at the lower end of the scale.  This policy approach, the approach of the Howard  Government, is to take away the safety nets and the minimum standards for the most  vulnerable in our society, for the lowest paid in our society.  So if there is an economic  down turn in the future, they will be the people who will suffer first and who will suffer  most.   

 JOURNALIST: It will be a very difficult fight after 1 July to go against these  changes.  Labor’s not shying away from that?   

 SMITH: Absolutely not.  We will make this a defining issue in the run up to the  2007 election.  A defining issue about the living standards of Australians, about the  conditions of working Australian families, their capacity to make ends meet.  They will 

 have a stark choice: Labor who believes in improving their living standards, in reducing  their tax burden with a greater tax cut, and in improving their wages and conditions.  In  contrast, the Government which simply wants to reduce their wages and conditions.
