 Minister Launches Information Kit on New Legislation

 MPS 177/2001

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock held a community and media briefing today to discuss the effects of the Border Control Legislation which passed through Parliament last week.

 Mr Ruddock was launching an information kit on the new legislation at the Novotel Darling Harbour.

 He said the laws ensured that Australia's sovereignty to decide who enters its borders, and who gets to stay here, was put beyond question.

 "By assisting us in our fight to repel the activities of people smugglers, these new laws will enable us to help those who are most in need of help - those people languishing in refugee camps around the world," Mr Ruddock said.

 "In recent times, the number of people entering Australia illegally meant we had no choice but to divert humanitarian program places away from our offshore program, which helps people identified as being in need of resettlement by the UNHCR.

 "These people have often been living in the most deprived of conditions in refugee camps for many years.

 "We simply could not help as many of them as we wanted to while we had this influx of people who had paid people smugglers to reach our shores," he said.

 However, the new laws, which include mandatory sentencing for people smugglers and preferential visa conditions for people who apply for refugee status while offshore, will help Australia regain control of its humanitarian intake.

 The laws include:

 No permanent residency for people who leave a safe country and attempt to enter Australia illegally by being transported to Christmas, Cocos, Cartier or Ashmore islands. They can never bring their families to join them, and cannot re-enter Australia if they leave for any reason.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Refusal of refugee status for people refusing to prove their identity by destroying their documents en route. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Minimum mandatory sentences of five years for first time people smugglers and eight years for repeat offenders, both with a maximum sentence of 20 years. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 An important message from the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock I want to tell you about some important changes to Australia's migration laws and to assure you that the changes in no way represent any reduction in Australia's steadfast commitment to our migration and humanitarian programs.

 Immigration has provided the foundation for Australia's success as a nation.

 It has grown and shaped our country and, well managed, will continue to act as a force for positive change.

 The Coalition Government remains absolutely committed to refugee protection. However we are determined to ensure that the asylum system is not abused and that only those in the most desperate need of resettlement are given places in Australia's refugee and humanitarian program.

 The Coalition's approach is firmly grounded in a solid commitment to the twin objectives of:

 Continuing to meet Australia's protection obligations and working to ensure the viability of the international protection system; while at the same time 1.  

 Doing everything possible to fight people smuggling. 2.  

 Under the new laws, anyone who arrives unlawfully on Christmas, Ashmore or Cocos islands may be taken to another country to have their claims assessed. If they are found to be refugees, they will be re-settled in a country willing to accept them and that might not be Australia.

 Anyone who has left a safe country, such as Indonesia, to travel unlawfully to Australia will

 never receive permanent residency in Australia. This means they can never bring their families to join them in Australia or be eligible to re-enter Australia if they leave for any reason.

 These laws have been introduced to strengthen Australia's ability to choose who comes to Australia, and who stays here. They help us in our fight against people smugglers. They also enable us to help those people most in need - the people who are living in refugee camps around the world.

 Those of you who have families living in refugee camps, waiting to be resettled by the UNHCR can take heart that these laws will assist Australia to help them sooner.

 The Coalition Government is committed to fighting people smuggling and the erosion of our capacity to assist those in genuine need, and I look forward to your continued support.

 Thank you.

 Philip Ruddock

 Information on the New Border Control Legislation In September 2001, the Government passed new laws to deter people smugglers and to protect Australia's borders. In recent times, people smugglers have attempted to control who enters Australia. These changes mean that Australia is once again able to control who enters our borders and who is allowed to stay here.

 The new laws will help protect Australia and will take the burden off Australia's humanitarian and judicial system.

 The new laws include:

 Changes affecting Australia's migration zone

 In the past people smugglers have sent boats to Ashmore, Cartier, Christmas, and Cocos Islands and the people have been bought to the mainland by the Australian Government at great expense.

 The new laws remove Ashmore and Cartier, Christmas, and Cocos Islands from Australia's migration zone so that in effect they are not part of Australia for migration purposes. This means that the people who travel illegally to these islands can no longer apply for any visa to Australia.

 A new visa system has been introduced and is explained below.

 New visa system

 In the past, people who arrive illegally in Australia have travelled through one or more countries where they could have stayed without fear of persecution. These countries are known as "safe countries".

 People who are assessed by UNHCR while in the first safe country they reach after leaving their home country, and who are then selected by Australia for resettlement will get a permanent visa. Their families will be able to join them in Australia.

 People who apply from the second safe country they enter and who have been in that country for more than seven days are eligible for a temporary protection visa, They can apply for permanent residence after four and a half years. Their families will only be able to join them after they successfully obtain a permanent visa.

 People who arrive at Christmas, Cocos, Cartier and Ashmore islands only qualify for a temporary protection visa, which is valid for three years. They will never get permanent residence. Their families will never be able to join them. If they leave Australia they can not return.

 New jail terms

 People smugglers who bring people to Australia illegally will face more time in jail under the new Australian laws.

 Australian courts must now sentence those convicted of people smuggling (including crews of boats) to a minimum of five years in prison and possibly up to 20 years in prison for a first conviction, and at least eight years and up to 20 years for a second conviction of bringing people to Australia illegally. Stopping boats In the past it has been difficult for the Government to stop boats carrying illegal arrivals when they have been found in Australian waters. The new laws enhance Australian authorities' existing powers to board boats carrying illegal travellers, search the boat, detain the passengers and remove them from the boat. Court challenges to these actions are not allowed.

 Conduct in Australia disregarded

 In the past, illegal arrivals have taken action while in Australia which potentially brings them to the attention of authorities in their home country in order to strengthen their claims for protection.

 For example, asylum seekers who have sought out media attention in order to be identified publicly so they can place a sur place claim to remain in Australia, on the basis that their public identification would put them at risk in their home country.

 These new laws allow these self serving actions to be disregarded in the determination of refugee status.

 Proper documents

 Most people who arrive in Australia illegally by boat do not have proper documentation, having destroyed it on the way. Yet they have to travel through several other countries with documentation to get to Australia.

 The new laws mean that adverse inferences will be drawn if:

 people refuse to provide documents to prove their nationality and do not have an acceptable explanation for the missing documents. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the person refuses to provide information on appropriate oath or affirmation. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 This means that people who destroy their documents, like birth certificates or passports, are unlikely to be granted refugee status in Australia.

 Definition of refugee

 Australia is one of 138 signatory countries to the United Nations Convention and/or Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees.

 The Convention defines refugees as people who:

 are outside their country of nationality or their usual country of residence, and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 are unable or unwilling to return or to seek the protection of that country due to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The Government has been concerned for some time by the tendency of Australian courts to expand the definition of 'refugee' beyond the original intention of the Refugees convention.

 While not changing the Convention's definition of a refugee, the new law means that Australian courts must adhere to the definition as accepted by Australia when it accepted its obligation under the Refugees Convention.

 "Persecution" is defined as serious harm to the person, and involving systematic and discriminatory conduct.

 This means that people who are not in serious danger do not meet the criteria for refugee status.

 Refugee appeals

 The government has been concerned about people whose claims for protection have been rejected by DIMA and the Refugee Review Tribunal taking their appeals to the courts -often through the Federal, Full Bench of the Federal and High courts.

 The new laws aim to stop this.

 They provide very limited grounds on which an adverse decision can be successfully challenged in the courts.

 There has been an increasing trend for people who have had an adverse visa decision to join in class actions to delay their departure.

 These actions clog up the Australian courts and waste taxpayers money. The new laws state that if a person wishes to seek judicial review it must be done as an individual. No class actions are allowed.

  

 News Room

 Background Paper on Unauthorised Arrivals Strategy

 MPS 131/2001

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock today released a background paper on the Government's approach to the problems of irregular migration and people smuggling.

 Mr Ruddock, who is in Indonesia with ministerial colleagues for a series of meetings, said the strategy has been constructed around an integrated, comprehensive approach, which recognises that these are international problems that require international solutions.

 "In particular, these problems are intertwined with the longstanding and unresolved refugee caseloads around the world for which the international community needs to develop solutions," Mr Ruddock said.

 "This stands in stark contrast to claims by the Opposition. The Opposition leader's comments expose him and his colleagues as unaware of the complexity of the problem and bereft of ideas."

 The Government's approach comprises three major elements:

 prevention of the problem by minimising the outflows from countries of origin and secondary outflows from countries of first asylum; 1.  

 working with other countries to disrupt people smugglers and intercept their clients en route to their destination, while ensuring that those people in need of refugee protection are identified and assisted as early as is possible; and

 2.  

 developing appropriate reception arrangements for unauthorised arrivals who reach Australia, focusing on the early assessment of the refugee status of the individual, the 3.  

 prompt removal of those who are not refugees, or who are refugees but can access effective protection elsewhere, and the removal of additional benefits not required by the Refugees Convention to minimise the incentive for people to attempt illegal travel to Australia.

 "A key element is the development of a broad international consensus on the need for action and strengthened cooperation," Mr Ruddock said.

 "I have been working to this end by developing strong relationships with source, first asylum, donor, destination, and transit countries, in international forums and with the UNHCR and other international organisations over the past five years."

 Initiatives undertaken through this strategy include:

 seeking reform of the international protection system to ensure that protection is available to those who need it, in the countries where they first seek asylum; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the provision of $12 million in 2000-01 in targeted humanitarian aid to ameliorate the range of "push" factors in countries of origin and first asylum; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 engaging the international community to increase its humanitarian support to countries of origin and first asylum; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 an information campaign, targeted both domestically and overseas, entitled "Pay the People Smuggler and Pay the Price"; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the establishment of cooperative disruption arrangements with Indonesia and Cambodia; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 strengthening penalties for those involved in people smuggling; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 introduction of temporary protection visas to reduce the attractiveness of Australia for those seeking to enter illegally and claim asylum; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 introduction of legislation to exclude those who have access to effective protection elsewhere from Australia's asylum process; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 introduction of legislation to prevent abuse of the judicial process to extend the stay of people who have no entitlement to be here; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 introduction of legislation to protect the integrity of the Refugees Convention and to ensure that its definition is brought back to what it originally intended; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 allocation of an additional $14.3 million to support initiatives to resolve the situation of displaced Afghanis; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 improving detention capacity and shortening processing times for unauthorised arrivals; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 increased dialogue with countries of origin and first asylum aimed at putting in place an interlocking web of return and readmission agreements. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 "The Government is committed to the implementation of this strategy and I will be undertaking a range of initiatives in the coming months to ensure that our national interests continue to be pursued," Mr Ruddock said

 "The attached paper details the approach the government has taken and will continue to take in dealing with this complex and difficult problem," he said.

 Introduction

 Historically, Australia has enjoyed a high degree of control over those who enter and live in this country. Illegal migration to Australia, however, is not a new phenomenon.

 The first significant influx of illegal arrivals came by boat between 1975 and 1980 when more than 2000 Indochinese arrived fleeing oppressive regimes and internal conflict in Vietnam and Cambodia.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 A further 200 Cambodians arrived unauthorised by boat in 1989-90 to escape fighting between the Khmer Rouge and the new Cambodian government. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Throughout the 1990s there has been a regular flow of unauthorised arrivals by boat from China, with a total of 1,867 arriving between 1989 and 2000. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 In response, the then Government amended the Migration Act in December 1992 to require that all non-citizens who are unlawfully in Australia must be detained and removed as soon as practicable, unless they are granted a visa authorising their stay. In November 1994, 'safe third country' legislation was enacted that provided for the return of an unauthorised arrival to a country of prior protection.

 At the time the Coalition came to Government in March 1996, there were a total of 212 unauthorised boat arrivals from China in detention - many had been there several years. The ALP Government had no strategy for returning people who had failed asylum claims or who did not otherwise have an entitlement to remain in Australia.

 Since 1996, Minister Ruddock has travelled to China twice, and Departmental officials on numerous occasions, to negotiate the return of Chinese nationals who had no right to remain in Australia. These negotiations resulted in return arrangements whereby China accepted back its nationals and led to the quick turnaround of Chinese boat arrivals. Those arrangements have been in place since 1999. Most of the boats sailed directly from China and were not organised from Indonesia.The last boat from China arrived in December 1999.

 Change in illegal migration pattern

 In 1999, however, a notable change in the pattern of illegal migration to Australia emerged, for which existing policy approaches were inadequate.

 First, between July 1999 and June 2001 there were 8,316 unauthorised boat arrivals compared with 4,114 in the period from 1989-90 to 1998-99.

 Second, there has been a distinct shift in the nationality profile of unauthorised boat arrivals from mostly Asian to mostly Middle Eastern in origin.

 Third, there has been an increase in the percentage of these arrivals presenting protection claims. For the past two years, more than 80 percent of unauthorised boat arrivals in

 Australia made protection visa applications, compared with 46 per cent for 1998-99.

 Finally, people smuggling is now behind a large proportion of unauthorised arrivals, with Indonesia now the key staging point for the movement of people from the Middle East and Afghanistan to Australia. The disposal of identity documentation before arrival in Australia and the high proportion of nationality and identity fraud prevents Australian officials from accessing material, which might help to verify the claims made by those arriving.

 Response to changed patterns

 In response to this dramatic change in the caseload and country of origin and transit, Minister Ruddock undertook a comprehensive itinerary of visits to the Middle East, Pakistan, Indonesia and Europe in order to engage the international community on this issue.

 Furthermore, in April 1999 the Prime Minister established a Coastal Surveillance Task Force to make recommendations on the strengthening of coastal surveillance procedures and systems. The Government adopted the Task Force's recommendation for a $124 million, four year program to strengthen Australia's capacity to detect and deter illegal arrivals, including:

 improved Coastwatch, Customs and Navy capabilities to detect pursue, intercept and search boats carrying unauthorised arrivals; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the introduction of harsher penalties, such as up to 20 years' jail and fines of up to $220,000, for people smugglers; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the placement of an additional seven immigration compliance officers and five airline liaison officers in key overseas missions; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 increased funding for technical assistance to transit countries, including training and equipment; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the development of an Overseas Information Campaign aimed at discouraging illegal air and boat arrivals. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The Task Force also recommended that priority be given to concluding arrangements with source and transit countries and strengthening international cooperation in combating people smuggling.

 In late 1999, the Government established a second task force, the Unauthorised Arrivals in Australia Task Force, to look at the issues of international cooperation to combat irregular migration and people smuggling; measures to bolster the international protection framework; and steps to improve coordination and efficiency among Australian Government agencies.

 The primary outcome of this Task Force was the adoption of a comprehensive and integrated unauthorised arrivals strategy that addresses all points in the irregular migration chain, from source through first asylum and transit countries to destination countries. The three key elements of the strategy are:

 prevention of the problem by minimising the outflows from countries of origin and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 secondary outflows from countries of first asylum; working with other countries to disrupt people smugglers and intercept their clients en route to their destination, while ensuring that those in need of refugee protection are identified and assisted as early as is possible;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 developing appropriate reception arrangements for unauthorised arrivals who reach Australia, focusing on the early assessment of the refugee status of the individual, the prompt removal of those who are not refugees, or who are refugees but can access effective protection elsewhere.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The Government has adopted a whole-of-government approach to the management of irregular migration. This involves a high level of cooperation and coordination by all agencies involved in dealing with the problem including Immigration, Defence, Customs, AFP, Foreign Affairs and government intelligence agencies.

 1. Prevention

 In recognition that irregular migrants can be motivated by a range of a range of considerations, including humanitarian, protection and economic issues, the Government has sought to reduce the "push factors" from countries of origin and first asylum. Key actions under this strategy include:

 (a) Targeted aid funding

 Australia has provided substantial additional aid contributions to countries of origin and first asylum. In addition to the annual core contribution of $14.3 million to the UNHCR, the Government has committed almost $28 million since June 2000 for initiatives aimed at addressing the humanitarian needs of displaced Afghans and Iraqis refugees in the Middle East and South West Asia.

 In June 2000 $1.5 million was reallocated from Australia's 1999-2000 aid budget to the UNHCR 2000 Appeal for South-West Asia aimed at increasing the self-reliance of refugees in Iran and Pakistan;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 In 2000-01, under a joint AusAID/DIMA program $9.5 million was allocated as follows:

 $3.0 million for the World Food Program's drought relief and food activities in Afghanistan; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 $2.5 million to the UNHCR's South West Asia Appeal to assist countries of first asylum to receive and support asylum seekers from Afghanistan, and to strengthen their registration and refugee status determination programs;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 $1.7 million to the United Nation's Children Fund (UNICEF) for development, and poverty eradication programs in Afghanistan; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 $1.5 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross for emergency âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 programs in Afghanistan; and

 $0.8 million to the International Organisation for Migration to assist in stabilising the population in Afghanistan and to develop sustainable return and reintegration procedures.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 In June 2001, DIMA provided an additional $2.5 million to the IOM for support to camps for Internally Displaced Persons in Afghanistan. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 (b) Information campaigns

 The Government has conducted domestic and international information campaigns designed to:

 (i) highlight the dangers of illegal migration and deter people smugglers; and

 (ii) explain the legal avenues of migration to Australia.

 The domestic information campaign uses ethnic community networks and media. Our international information campaign is conducted in source countries as well as in first asylum and transit countries to target smugglers and their potential customers.

 (c) Technical cooperation, capacity building and information exchange

 The Government has supported key countries of first asylum in combating irregular migration and people smuggling through cooperative approaches including the provision of technical assistance, and the exchange of intelligence and information.

 In May 2000, the Australian Government sponsored a workshop for Turkey's judges and prosecutors on refugee law issues. During 2000-01 Australian immigration officers presented successful document awareness and fraud detection training courses in Iran, Jordan, Pakistan and Syria.

 Australia has passed information to authorities in the Middle East on people smuggling activities that were targeting Australia. This has resulted in the arrest and deportation of a number of people. In January 2001, Syria signed a Record of Meeting with Australia, agreeing to the exchange of information relating to the activities and methods of people smugglers. In August, Malta signed a Memorandum of Understanding. Pakistan and Iran are currently considering agreements on the exchange of information.

 (d) International cooperation to enhance the integrity of the global protection system

 The Government has undertaken broad-ranging efforts aimed at increasing the international focus on the need to improve the operation of the international protection system. The Inter-Governmental Consultations process (IGC) has been one of our primary channels for engaging donor/destination countries on illegal migration and people smuggling issues.

 Australia took over as IGC Chair for the 12 months from November 2000 and focused on resolving problems in an integrated and comprehensive way, including:

 increased efforts to combat people smuggling; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» better targeted provision of aid and other forms of assistance; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 dealing with the Afghan and Iraqi caseloads; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the need to ensure that the provision of protection does not also provide an automatic migration outcome, which acts as incentive for movement. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The European Union (EU) is another important multilateral forum for engagement. Our engagement with the EU has been increasing steadily over the past 12 months, including through our participation in the EU's High Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration (HLWG), which could be a valuable channel for cooperation to combat irregular migration from the Middle East.

 In addition, and in line with the review of United Nations' Treaty Bodies, the Government has pursued the reform of the UNHCR and its controlling body the Executive Committee (ExCom). The primary aim of this reform has been to seek to make ExCom more responsive to the needs of member states and more focused on responding to the challenges that irregular migration and people smuggling pose for the international system of protection.

 Activities with IOM include supporting a move towards recognition of the strategic role IOM can play as a forum for a wide range of countries with an interest in migration matters. IOM has the task of developing the framework of inter-governmental understandings and a consistent set of principles for all aspects of international migration in the lead up to the second Berne Initiative Conference in 2002-03.

 2. Disruption

 People smugglers have played a key role in the increase in irregular migration. In response, the Government initiated a range of actions, including:

 (a) Australian resources overseas

 DIMA has an extensive network of internationally posted Airline Liaison Officers (ALOs), Compliance officers and Liaison officers.

 ALOs investigate people smuggling, liaising with authorities in the host country, exchanging information, and providing training to assist in combating irregular migration. In the 2000-2001 Budget, the Government provided $3.1 million over four years was allocated to place additional ALOs in airports known to be key transit routes for irregular migrants.

 Compliance officers work closely with those host country agencies involved with border control and immigration law enforcement to counter and disrupt the activities of people smugglers. In the 2000-2001 Budget, the Government provided $12.4 million over four years was allocated to expand DIMA's compliance officer network (initially in Islamabad, Belgrade, Moscow, Amman, Tehran, Suva and Cairo) to combat document and identity

 fraud and people smuggling. Liaison officers have also been placed in Vietnam, Iran, Jordan and Pakistan.

 (b) Technical cooperation and capacity building

 The Government has undertaken a range of capacity building measures to assist other countries in our region to develop the systems and expertise necessary to deal with the problems of people smuggling and irregular migration.

 Minister Ruddock visited Papua New Guinea in October 2000 and a senior officials visit was undertaken in June 2001. These visits produced agreement on a range of joint cooperative activities to enhance PNG's border management capacity.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 In East Timor, the Government has been discussing potential areas of cooperation with the interim Ministers and intends to continue to work with East Timor after the new government is constituted.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Document awareness and fraud detection training was provided in March 2000 to Indonesian immigration officials. Subsequently, a range of cooperative activities have been initiated, including joint training on: border management issues; character issues; bona fides assessment; entry strategies; and further document examination exchanges.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 There have also been efforts to work with the Cambodian authorities to prevent Cambodia becoming a staging point for unauthorised arrivals to Australia. In June 2001, document fraud training was provided for over 200 Cambodian officials. In order to build on their recent cooperation, a delegation of Cambodian officials visited Australia in August to discuss areas of mutual interest, and possible areas of future cooperation. The Government is currently negotiating with Cambodia towards an MOU on combating irregular migration and people smuggling, which includes provision for the orderly return of migrants.

 Australia and Thailand recently signed a Joint Ministerial Statement (JMS) to combat irregular migration and people smuggling, which outlines ways in which the cooperation between the two countries can be enhanced. So far, Australia has provided technical and financial assistance for a five-week training program for over Immigration Bureau Police.

 In May 2001 Australian and Vietnamese officials met in Hanoi to discuss a range of technical cooperation initiatives, including the provision of border infrastructure such as computer assistance and document fraud training.

 (c) Intelligence gathering and exchange

 Intelligence information includes successfully identifying organisers of people smuggling, routes taken and the origin of bogus documents. Where possible, Australia passes back to the country of origin any information that it has collected on organisers of unauthorised arrivals to help local authorities with prosecutions.

 The Government has:

 worked closely with countries throughout the region to exchange information on the activities and methods of people smugglers; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 pursued a greater emphasis on information exchange and intelligence issues through various fora, including the Inter Governmental Asia Pacific Consultations on Refugees, Displaced Persons and Migrants (APC); and

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 improved the national intelligence coordination effort against people smuggling and illegal migration, including the creation of several national intelligence coordination oversight committees.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 An example of the value of information exchange is the interception in Cambodia of an Australia-bound boat carrying 239 third country nationals who did not have permission to enter Australia, which resulted from intelligence exchanged between Indonesia, Cambodia and Australia.

 (d) Regional cooperation aimed at interception of irregular migrants

 Australia has supported the establishment of cooperative arrangements between the UNHCR and IOM and the Governments of Indonesia and Cambodia to intercept irregular migrants within their territories. The arrangements have resulted in:

 the interception of over 2,700 irregular migrants. Of that number approximately 990 are still in detention across Indonesia (mainly Iraqi and Afghan nationals). This number comprises people awaiting refugee determination as well as those who have been found not to be in need of protection;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 UNHCR assessing 480 third country nationals to be refugees. UNHCR is currently negotiating with donor countries for the resettlement of these people; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the removal by IOM of 180 third country nationals from Indonesia. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Detainees are accommodated in a number of transmigration centres or hotels across the Indonesian archipelago, which are not secure and a number have therefore left these arrangements.

 3. Reception

 The Government has implemented a range of measures to ensure that those who do reach Australia are dealt with efficiently, focussing on the early assessment of the status of the individual and removal of those immigrants who are not refugees or can access effective protection elsewhere. In addition, the Government has reduced the availability of additional benefits not required by the Refugees Convention to minimise the incentive for people to attempt illegal travel to Australia.

 (a) Detention arrangements

 The Government remains committed to the principle of mandatory detention for all persons

 without authority to be in Australia, implemented since 1992. The Government has established seven detention facilities around Australia, including two facilities at Curtin RAAF Base in Western Australia and Woomera in South Australia established in response to the sudden surge of arrivals 1999.

 From 7 August 2001, alternative detention arrangements have been trialed for 25 women and children who are living outside the Woomera IRPC in a cluster of four three-bedroom houses under close ACM supervision. Each has a family member remaining at Woomera, an application for asylum under consideration and poses neither character nor management risks.

 Major new detention facilities, announced in the 2000 Budget, are also planned for Darwin and Brisbane.

 On 23 August 2001, the Minister announced plans to increase contingency capacity for detaining unauthorised boat arrivals, including:

 a temporary reception and processing centre at HMAS Coonawarra in Darwin for unauthorised arrivals located off northern Australia. This facility will be an initial processing point, with detainees moved to other centres within a few days; ultimately it will be replaced by the permanent Darwin reception and detention centre announced in the 2000 Budget;

 (b) Processing capacity

 Since the sharp increase in late 1999 in the number of unauthorised arrivals, the Government has substantially re-engineered the processing of unauthorised arrivals without compromising the integrity of its assessment.

 80% of protection visa applications made by unauthorised boat arrivals in late 1999 received a decision within seven and a half months, this has been reduced to less than 14 weeks for applications lodged in late 2000.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Where applications are straightforward, decisions can now be made in as little as 2-3 weeks after lodgement. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 (c) Legislative changes

 A range of legislative amendments have been implemented to reduce the incentives of using Australian refugee law to achieve a migration outcome:

 On 1 July 1997, legislative amendments were introduced to remove the main incentive for people to use the system to prolong their stay in Australia. These amendments provide access to work rights only for those people who have been in Australia for less than 45 days in the 12 months before they applied for a protection

 visa.

 On 20 October 1999, regulation changes came into effect that provide for unauthorised arrivals, who are recognised as requiring Australia's protection obligations to be granted a three-year temporary protection visa (TPV) instead of a permanent protection visa.

 The regulations were amended on 1 November 2000 to provide that those people who are immigration cleared on fraudulent documents, apply for a protection visa and are found to be owed protection obligations, only have access to a temporary protection visa in the first instance.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 In December 1999, amendments were introduced to ensure that people who clearly have alternative protection avenues available to them will be prevented from making a valid protection visa application, unless there are public interest grounds for allowing them access to Australia's refugee determination system.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 On 28 August 2001, legislative amendments were introduced into parliament to restore the interpretation of the refugees convention to its original intention and to promote integrity in the protection visa process.

 (d) Negotiations on returns

 The Government has been working bilaterally for the past eighteen months to highlight to countries of origin and first asylum for irregular migrants the need to establish arrangements to return these people to their country of origin or to a country where they have previously had access to effective protection.

 The Minister has travelled extensively throughout the Middle East, South and South-East Asia, Europe and North America to engage with governments on these issues. The major focus to date has been on the primary caseloads in detention: Afghans, Iraqis, Iranians and Palestinians. These efforts will continue.

 Future actions

 The Government remains committed to the implementation of this strategy and will be taking a range of initiatives in the coming months to ensure that our national interests continue to be pursued:

 On 28 August 2001, the Minister announced the allocation of an additional $14.3 million to support the development of options aimed at resolving the situation of displaced Afghans.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The Government is now working to develop a coalition of countries interested in supporting information campaigns in key countries. Such an approach will ensure the delivery of a single, coherent message with a greater geographic reach than

 Ongoing cooperation with Indonesia will remain an essential element of the strategy. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The APC is the pre-eminent regional forum dealing with refugee and migration issues, including irregular migration and people smuggling.

 DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS

 90. NEW MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN BORDER CONTROL

 The Australian Government is firmly committed to ensuring the integrity of Australia’s borders and to the effective control and management of the movement of people to and from Australia.

 This commitment stands beside Australia’s absolute commitment to meeting its international obligations under refugee-related conventions.

 Underlying these commitments is the fact that Australia is a sovereign country which decides who can and who cannot enter and stay on its territory. Only Australian citizens have the unrestricted right to travel freely in and out of the country - all other people must have a legal authority in the form of a visa.

 Reinforcing the commitment are Australia’s migration laws and regulations which set the criteria and standards that foreign nationals must meet if they wish to travel to and remain in Australia for a period of time.

 Each year a substantial number of people seek to enter or remain in Australia by circumventing immigration laws. They may overstay their visas, obtain visas by fraudulent means, or try to enter without legal authority by air or sea.

 Increasingly, Australia is experiencing an influx of illegal boat arrivals. They are being transported to Australia by organised criminal gangs of people smugglers.

 It is significant that many of the people who pay people smugglers to move them around the world have bypassed effective protection arrangements in countries closer to their home. Many people travelling to Australia unlawfully are undertaking a secondary movement from their country of first asylum to use the asylum system to achieve a migration outcome.

 By doing so they take scarce resettlement places which would otherwise be available to refugees identified overseas as being in greatest need and for whom resettlement was the only viable solution to their plight.

 Under the law, all non-citizens who are in Australia unlawfully must be detained and

 removed as soon as practicable, unless they are granted a visa authorising their stay.

 New Laws

 Against the background of high numbers of illegal boat arrivals, the Federal Parliament passed a series of new laws in September 2001 designed to strengthen Australia’s territorial integrity and to reduce incentives for people to make hazardous voyages to Australian territories. The laws are an important step towards the objective of deterring the activities of people smugglers.

 The main points of the new laws include the following:

 â¢ The excision of certain territories from Australia’s migration zone in relation to unauthorised arrivals to those territories  -people who cannot apply for a visa.

 â¢ The possible detention and removal from those territories of unauthorised arrivals. 

 â¢ Measures to strengthen deterrence in relation to unauthorised arrivals, including the introduction of a new visa regime and minimum terms of imprisonment for people smugglers.

 â¢ The possibility that an adverse inference may be drawn about claimed identity and/or nationality where unauthorised arrivals fail to provide information to support their claims.

 â¢ Guidance in relation to the meaning of “refugee” for the purposes of Australian law.

 â¢ Limited grounds of judicial review in migration matters.

 â¢ Prohibition of class actions in migration litigation.

 â¢ Measures to put beyond doubt the legality of the actions of the Government in relation to the MV Tampa and the Aceng, and additional statutory authority for future action.

 The new legislative measures are in addition to ongoing prevention and interdiction efforts. This work includes efforts to disrupt departures, return boats and failed asylum seekers, as well as positive leadership in the international arena.

 Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Act 2001

 Under this legislation, certain Australian territories have been excised from the migration zone for purposes related to unauthorised arrivals. Any unauthorised person who arrives in an excised territory will not be able to apply for an Australian visa unless the Minister exercises his discretionary power.

 Australia will meet its international protection obligations under the UN Refugees Convention by making an assessment for refugee status for any asylum seekers. For people who are found to be refugees, the Minister is able to use his non-compellable discretionary power to allow an application for a visa to be made. Alternatively, third country resettlement may be the preferred outcome. The territories excised from the migration zone are:

 â¢ Ashmore and Cartier Islands in the Timor Sea (from 8 September 2001)

 â¢ Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean (from 8 September 2001)

 â¢ Cocos (Keeling) Island in the Indian Ocean (from 17 September 2001)

 â¢ Offshore resource and other installations

 Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions Act) 2001

 This legislation introduces a new visa regime for people who arrive in an area excised from the migration zone that precludes access to permanent residence in Australia. It also allows for the detention and removal of unauthorised arrivals in the excision zone and includes powers to remove a person to another country where their claims, if any, for refugee status may be handled.

 The new visa regime provides for a hierarchy of benefits depending on whether the applicant has been involved in secondary movement, and where people made their application. The

 measure is aimed at deterring further movement from, or the bypassing of, other safe countries. It does this to create further disincentives to unauthorised arrival in Australia by those who use people smugglers with the aim of achieving a resettlement place they may well not need - a place taken from refugees with no other options available to them.

 These arrangements are consistent with Australia’s international obligations under refugee-related conventions. They retain Australia’s long-standing commitment to the protection of refugees while they are in need of such protection. For example, unauthorised arrivals and those who leave countries of first asylum may be granted temporary visas only in the first instance and will have no access to permanent residence.

 People who attempt to enter Australia via an excised territory such as Christmas Island cannot apply for any class of visa (unless the Minister exercises his discretionary power). However, such people will be guaranteed access to asylum determination processes to ensure that any protection needs are identified and addressed.

 The legislation also prevents the commencement of legal proceedings against the Government in relation to the entry, status, detention and transfer of a person arriving unlawfully.

 Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Act 2001

 The Act introduces minimum penalties for people smuggling of five years for a first conviction and eight years for a second conviction.

 The legislation also reinforces the legality of actions of the Government and its officers taken in relation to the MV Tampa and the Aceng. It also provides additional statutory authority for future action in relation to vessels carrying unauthorised arrivals and the unauthorised arrivals themselves.

 This puts beyond doubt that decisions about who can and who cannot enter Australia is within the sovereign power of the Australian Parliament.

 Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Act 1998

 This legislation gives effect to the Government’s long-standing policy commitment to restrict access to judicial review in migration matters in all but exceptional circumstances.

 The commitment was made in the light of the extensive merits review rights by independent tribunals. There were also concerns about the ever-growing cost and incidence of migration litigation and the associated delays in removal of non-citizens with no right to remain in Australia.

 The Act does not bar access to either the Federal Court or the High Court. However, the grounds for judicial review are greatly reduced, allowing for a faster resolution of court cases, thereby decreasing delays in removal of non-citizens and lowering costs.

 Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 2001

 This legislation addresses a trend which has seen class action litigation being used by people with no lawful authority to remain in Australia to obtain a bridging visa and thereby substantially extend their stay.

 Large numbers of people have been encouraged to participate in class actions in order to obtain a bridging visa at little personal cost.

 The legislation gives effect to the Government’s commitment to prohibit class actions in migration litigation and to limit the number of people who may commence and continue proceedings in the courts.

 In summary, the legislation:

 â¢ Prohibits class actions in migration litigation; â¢ Provides for an exception to the general bar on class actions by giving

 the court a discretion to consolidate individual matters for the efficient conduct of proceedings; â¢ Introduces a 35-day time limit on applications to the High Court.

 Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No. 5) 2001

 This Act allows private sector organisations such as airlines, travel agents and shipping

 companies to continue to provide information about people’s travel to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA).

 The legislation has been formulated against the background of the provisions of the Privacy Act which prohibits the disclosure of personal information (other than for the purpose for which the information was given) unless each person consents.

 The use of automated systems makes it impractical for every traveller to consent to the release of information that may include their name, sex, date and country of birth, passport number and flight details.

 However, the Department needs to receive this information to ensure speedy immigration clearance. Without it, there may be significant delays at air and sea port immigration points.

 The only viable solution was to amend the Migration Act to authorise the disclosure of information. However, no organisation is compelled to provide it. The authorisation also extends to other prescribed organisations, allowing for the flexibility to add others to the migration regulations, should the need arise.

 Migration Legislation Amendment Act (No. 6) 2001

 The purpose of this legislation is twofold, firstly to define the application in Australia of the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and secondly to strengthen powers to protect asylum processes against an increasing incidence of fraud in the presentation of claims.

 In relation to the UN Convention, the Government has been concerned that Australian courts have expanded the definition of a “refugee” beyond the original intention of the Convention. The changes to legislation will provide greater consistency in decision-making by government agencies, tribunals and courts. They clarify the meaning of some of the key elements of the Refugee Convention including Article 33 and the definition of a refugee in Article 1. 

 In future, the Refugees Convention will not apply in relation to persecution unless a Convention reason (that is, a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion) is the essential and significant reason for the persecution; the

 4

 persecution involves serious harm to the person; and involves systematic and discriminatory conduct. Under the legislation, any conduct by a person in Australia shall not be taken into account in determining whether Australia owes them protection obligations, unless the Minister is satisfied that such actions were undertaken in good faith and not to strengthen the protection claims.

 One example of such conduct might be where someone in Australia publicly criticises the government of their country of origin and claims protection because the comments could jeopardise their safety on return.

 The legislation also clarifies the circumstances in which a person can be excluded from the benefit of Australia’s protection under the Refugees Convention on the basis of serious criminal conduct. The changes will prevent people whose protection visas have been cancelled, or who have previously applied as family members and

 been refused, from making another protection visa application.

 The legislation also addresses the need to act against the increasing incidence of fraud and presentation of claims that lack integrity. Therefore, unauthorised arrivals and protection visa applicants may be required to provide information on oath or affirmation and adverse inferences may be drawn if they fail to do so.

 In addition, in a claim for a protection visa and in the absence of identifying documentation without reasonable explanation, adverse inferences may be drawn about the veracity of claimed identity and/or nationality.

 The legislation also strengthens and broadens Ministerial powers to act in exceptional circumstances in the public interest to grant visas to those not found to be refugees.

 The Department also operates a 24-hour national telephone inquiry line on 131 881, for the cost of a local call anywhere in Australia.
