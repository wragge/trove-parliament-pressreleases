 SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Tuesday, 23 September 2014    

 Greens urge government to announce  emergency refugee intake    

 The Australian Greens have urged the Abbott government to respond to the UN’s calls for an  increased humanitarian effort in the Middle East by announcing an urgent increase in Australia’s  refugee intake.    

 “In just the last few days, Turkey has accepted as many refugees as Australia will in the next ten  years,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “Australia can and must do more to address the refugee crisis in the Middle East. We have to  step up to the plate and increase the level of financial aid and refugee support that Australia’s  offering.”    

 The Greens have announced that they will introduce a bill to restore Australia’s humanitarian  intake to 20,000 places per year on Thursday.    

 “War creates refugees and Australia clearly has a role to play in protecting those who are  fleeing from the violence in Iraq and Syria,” Senator Hanson-Young said.    

 “Slashing the refugee intake was a short-sighted move from the Abbott government. Backing  this bill and restoring the intake to 20,000 places a year would be a step in the right direction.”
