 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Tuesday, 15 April 2014   

 Greens to introduce bill to keep babies from  being sent offshore   

 The Australian Greens will introduce legislation to ensure that babies born to refugee parents in  Australia will not be sent to offshore detention.   

 “Babies should be cared for, not sent to the Government’s horrific detention camp on Nauru,”  the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “It’s unacceptable that the cruelty of the Abbott Government means that the Greens’ have had  to introduce legislation to keep babies safe in Australia.   

 “I will be writing to every MP, appealing to their conscience and asking for them to take a stand  against this immorality.   

 “Many Australians would be horrified to know that babies who are only a few weeks old are  being sent to detention offshore.   

 “Children don’t belong in detention and vulnerable babies should never have been sent to  Nauru.   

 “In years to come, people will look back at the Abbott Government’s practice of locking innocent  children up on remote Pacific islands and shake their heads with disbelief.   

 “I am calling on all of my Parliamentary colleagues to recognise that, when we are sending  innocent babies to detention camps, Australia’s cruelty has gone too far.”
