 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - ALP SPECIAL NATIONAL RULES CONFERENCE, CANBERRA  SUNDAY 6 OCTOBER 2002

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 Subjects: ALP Rules Conference; Iraq War Tax; Asylum-seekers

 CREAN: Well, I’m very pleased with the outcome of the Conference. I said to the Party that I wanted their support for the reforms that I wanted to get through, and I got that support.  I was always confident of getting it, because the Party is serious about winning the next election.  It knows the people it represents are not being served well by the Howard Government.  It needs change, and we represent that change.

 If we’re going to get a change of government, we had to change ourselves. And the commitment of the delegates at this Conference to embrace that change, as difficult as those decisions were for many of them - is a great tribute to them.

 I know that with the support of my colleagues, the commitment that’s come from this Conference, we can go on and win the next election.

 JOURNALIST: But were the changes more symbolic than significant?

 CREAN: These were hugely significant changes.  They demonstrate a commitment on the part of the Labor Party to be more open, more inclusive, more honest - honest in terms of the integrity of the preselection process, which is vital to rebuild a trust in the politicians of this country.

 The reforms that I’ve undertaken in that direction are the only reforms being undertaken at the moment.  I challenge the Howard Government to do the same.  I don’t believe anyone should vote in a preselection if they can’t vote in an election.  I’ve now got rules that ensure that to be the case within the Labor Party.  I challenge the Howard Government to do it within the Liberal Party.  People shouldn’t be able to vote for preselections if they live overseas, but they can in the Liberal Party.  They can’t in the Labor Party.  No one now can vote in a preselection for the Labor Party unless they’re on the electoral

 roll.  And that’s as it should be.  No one can question the integrity of the Australian Electoral Roll, and that should be the basis upon which parties put their candidates forward.  That is a very significant change.

 The other significant change, of course, is that we’ve come to grips with a new appeals mechanism to avoid having the litigation in the courts - an independent tribunal that can make judgements and can hear grievances of the Party members.

 The opening up of the Party Conference will enable more people, many more people, to attend the Conference.  It lowers the quota, it makes it easier for the rank-and-file members to get here.  That’s something that also needs to be recognised.  And, of course, the change to the 50:50 rule means that we, in the opening up of the party, in the greater inclusion, are appealing on the basis of inviting people in on an equal partnership.  And that equality of partnership is terribly important.

 And the affirmative action rule, the changes to that is a very substantial change indeed, because it demonstrates our ongoing commitment to not just get more women in the Parliament, but more women involved in the Party activities - a representation, a better representation of Australian society.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, the fact that you didn’t deliver on direct elections to National Conference, doesn’t take some of the lustre off this event, especially since that was indeed recommendation number one of the Hawke-Wran Review?

 CREAN: Some form of direct election, some form yes, well there is some form.  There’s the direct election of the President, and there’s also direct participation by every Party member in the policy process.  You won’t find that in the Liberal Party.  You won’t find it in the National Party.  You’ll only find it in the Australian Labor Party, and that is a significant advance on directness.

 On the question of the Conference, I think the underlying objective is enabling more people to get to the Conference easier.  If you have a direct election, the quota is so large it becomes almost impossible for someone to get to National Conference.  In New South Wales, a person would have to get under the structure something like 400 votes.  Who can organise the 400 votes?  A union could, but if we’re serious about rank and file participation, we have to make it easier for rank-and-file members to get to Conferences.

 And by expanding the size of the State Conference and by expanding the size of the National Conference, you lower the quota, you make it easier for people to get there.  So the objective wasn’t direct or indirect, the objective was greater participation.  And the model that we’ve adopted better achieves that result.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, are you saying that just by doubling the size of Conference, you are going to do more than actually just double the size of genuine rank and file here?  Because we’ve already heard today that, or yesterday that there’s less than ten genuine rank-and-file members here - people who aren’t union officials, politicians, their staffers, that kind of people.

 CREAN: Have a look at the proxy delegates, though. And the point is, they’re proxies because they can’t get into the first slate.  Simply by doubling the size of the Conference, you give them a greater opportunity. But, importantly, rank and filers who now understand that the structure at State Conference will enable them to get there easier, because the quota at State Conference must be lower with a bigger State Conference and, likewise at the National Conference, they are encouraged.  They know they can make it if they put some effort in.  They’re not prohibited from making it.  That’s what I want to see, and that’s what these rules will do.

 JOURNALIST: This clears the decks, doesn’t it, for policy?  When would we see a full platform from the Labor Party?

 CREAN: You’ll see policy, Dennis, continued to be developed over the course of, now, the next two years in the same way as we’ve been developing it over the last twelve months.  We’ve already announced policy in terms of commitment to Paid Maternity Leave.  We’ve already done it in terms of securing 100 per cent of workers’ entitlements.  We’ve already determined our policy in relation to the war on Iraq.  We’ve already determined policy in relation to support the Community Safety Zones, making our streets safer. We’ve already announced policy in terms of protecting kids where they are being cared for.  Now these are all significant.

 And we’ve also announced by way of Private Member’s Bills the protection of workers’ entitlements and a tightening of corporate governance to protect people’s investment, retirements.  And we’ve also put out policy in terms of more affordable housing.

 JOURNALIST: So well ahead …

 CREAN: Now, no, no I think it’s important to remind you, because the question is always asked: when are we going to see the policy?  You will continue to see policy.  In the way in which we have put policy out in the last twelve months, we will do it over the course of the next two years.  We have …

 JOURNALIST: Including the big-ticket policies?

 4

 CREAN: You will see the policy rolled out appropriately as we choose to roll it out.  And some of the items that we’ve already put out involve some big-ticket items.  So, yes, you’ll see that.

 But we’ve got a policy review process in place chaired by Jenny Macklin.  This was a Conference to bring closure to the internal structures of the Party, to modernise ourselves.  That has been a great success over the course of the last couple of days, and we move on from here.

 On Tuesday, for example, I’m going down to Cunningham to announce the commitments in terms of the Community Safety Zones, making our streets safer and putting it in the context of a particular community.  And on Wednesday and Thursday I’ll be up in drought-affected territory wanting to know why, when I was able to put a drought policy together in 1994 and negotiate it with seven coalition State Ministers and get it implemented, why is it that the Howard Government can’t take that policy and implement it effectively with eight Labor States.  This is a Government that just doesn’t know how to deal with things.  The framework exists to do it.  My policy, a drought policy, and they don’t know even know how to implement it.

 JOURNALIST: On Iraq, Mr Crean, will you rule out supporting in any circumstances a war levy if there is action against Iraq?

 CREAN: I noticed today that the Treasurer was again talking about the war tax.  I mean, this is a bit rich, this Government.  This was a Government that said they had a GST, a simple new tax and it would get rid of all other taxes.  Ever since the GST was introduced, we’ve only seen new taxes introduced.  A ticket tax for Ansett; a dairy tax, a milk tax; a sugar tax; a tax for medical indemnity; and, now, a war tax.  I mean, this is a Government that has so badly handled the economy, run the economy into deficit, it’s now talking about taxes.  Nothing that was said by Peter Costello today justifies a war tax, and we won’t be supporting it.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, initially you were ambivalent about the notion of a tougher quota to achieve greater numbers of women in Parliament.  What changed your mind?

 CREAN: My reaction was to the 50:50 announcement.  A proposition that says that what you mandate is equality of outcome. I said at the time that the Hawke-Wran Report came out that I thought the quota had been, the 35 per cent had been significant in getting more women in the Parliament.

 And I noted at the time the significant growth since 1994, and the number of women members of Parliament in both Federal and State Labor Parties, a doubling of them. I indicated, though, that it was silly to look at the issue just in the context of increasing the quota for Parliamentarians, that what we had to do is to build the culture, build on the success - but do it through the Party

 channels, the Party institutions, the Party positions as well as the union representation. Once we were able to get the debate back from the 50:50, the mandating of equal outcomes, I was always prepared to embrace consideration of increasing the targets for improving equality of opportunity. That’s what’s been reflected here today.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, you got many of your reforms up this weekend with the support of the Left. The Left played a significant role in this. Is that a change, are you in the owe or the debt of the Left, and is that an issue for you?

 CREAN: I got my reforms up with the overwhelming support of this Conference, Fran. The one vote that went to conference I won two-to-one. Now the last time I looked, the Left had significantly less numbers than that.

 What I got was cross-party support for all of the reforms and, in the end, we got unanimity on Affirmative Action. That was something that I was being told was impossible to achieve and it was supposed to be a close-run thing before it.  I got there because I was determined to achieve the reform. I was prepared to persist with the issues that I believed to be correct. I was prepared to continue talking to all of the groups within the Party to achieve that outcome. What you saw at this conference in me was someone determined to achieve the appropriate outcomes, and I succeeded on every front.

 JOURNALIST: What do you say to the union leaders, Mr Crean, who are angry at the outcomes over 60:40? Do you think there’ll be any backlash to you over that, and what’s your message to them?

 CREAN: No, not for one moment.  And, indeed, I’ve heard representatives from those that supported the continuation of the 60:40 saying: the decision’s made, we move on. Labor Party Conferences are always like that. We can have our differences.  They can be bitterly fought, but people accept the collective decision. They won’t agree with it in the lead-up to it but they will accept the outcome and that they will do with this decision.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, a number of people on the Left say that because their bloc vote delivered you 50:50, they expect you to be more sympathetic to their agenda. Do you reject that suggestion?

 CREAN: Yes I do. I mean I’ll be sympathetic to all good issues that come before us, all good issues, from wherever they come. But I’ll be putting back to all of the groups within the Party how I believe the policy direction of the Party should be taken as well. I’m going to engage constructively in the dialogue. That constructive engagement delivered me success at this Conference today. And if I can do it in the context of the rules and structures, I’m convinced that I can do it in terms of the policy as well.

 JOURNALIST: Given the arrangements struck in terms of asylum-seekers in that Committee, will Labor still deliver its policy on asylum-seekers before the end of the year? 

 CREAN: We will continue to consult to get it right, Fran. This was never a conference called to discuss asylum-seekers, never. And those that sought to make it that, in my view, were being mischievous. Now it’s true that they have genuine issue to raise, but there are mechanisms set up to do it.

 So far as the new consultative mechanisms is concerned, it’s a continuation of what we’ve been doing. We have been consulting at length on this issue. We have been putting out policy already. We’ve already announced that we would get the kids out from behind the razor wire. We would close Woomera. We would return the running of the facilities to the Australian Protective Services. We would make the facilities more open to scrutiny.

 We’ve opposed the excisions of the islands, and we’ve also forced the Government - in terms of the people it had to take off ‘Club Nauru’, and bring back into Australia - forced the Government to accept that they should retain the same appeal rights as others. They are significant changes in their own right.

 But I am committed to achieving this outcome, an outcome that involves our strength on border protection but is compassionate to refugees at the same time. That is a mix that I can get right. Now there are some issues that still have to be resolved and we will resolve them. And what I’ve done is to establish the mechanism by which that goes.  The timing of it will be determined when we’re ready.

 JOURNALIST: Have you made a commitment that it will go back to Conference before it’s finalised?

 CREAN: No, I haven’t made that, and that story was absolutely wrong.  But it’s something that we’ve gotten used to from the Sydney Morning Herald.

 JOURNALIST: It’s not absolutely wrong, Mr Crean.

 CREAN: It was absolutely wrong. There is no commitment to this decision being held up until the next Conference. The Parliamentary Party can determine the position. Of course, decisions determined there have to be done in accordance with the Constitution and Platform of the Party and, of course, they are subject to review at the Conference. But there is no commitment, no commitment to hold up that decision until the next Conference, and if the journalist had’ve accepted the advice that was rung through by my office, that story should never have been printed.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, on the matter of direct elections is that issue now off the agenda, or is it something that you would be prepared to return to some time in the future?

 CREAN: No, no look the rules are closed, right. The rules are closed. This was to bring closure to the rules debate, to the reforming of the Party. You want me to have another rules conference? Well I don’t want have one, Tony, I want to have one on policy and I will.

 JOURNALIST: Is mandatory detention negotiable as part of the refugee package?

 CREAN: No, I’m committed to the continuation of mandatory detention. There has to be a detention for circumstances associated with the checks. Most people in the Party, an overwhelming majority of people in the Party accept that. The issue is the length of time it takes, the conditions under which people are held. They’re the issues I want to get right and they will be part of our solution.

 Now listen I’ve got to catch a plane. I haven’t seen the family for a long time. Would you excuse me because it won’t wait for us.

 JOURNALIST: Did you warn the Left that the Party would move further to the Right unless they backed you on 50:50?

 CREAN: I’ve never heard anything so fanciful. And the simple answer is no.

 Thank you.
