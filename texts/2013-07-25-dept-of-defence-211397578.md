 Media Release  

 

 

 25 July 2013  

 A statement from the Chief of the Defence  Force 

 Contrary to media reporting today, the Chief of the Defence Force,  General David Hurley has not provided advice or recommendations to  Opposition Leader, Mr Tony Abbott with respect to Coalition policy on  asylum seeker issues. 

 Defence understands that the Chief of the Defence Force would be  consulted regarding any future policies affecting Defence to be  implemented by a future government. 

 The Chief of the Defence Force’s role is to implement the policies of  the Government of the Day and the Australian Defence Force  continues to contribute to the whole-of-government effort to protect  Australia’s borders and offshore maritime interests through Operation  RESOLUTE. 

 Approximately 500 Defence personnel are assigned to support  Operation RESOLUTE and up to seven Armidale Class Patrol Boats, one  major Fleet Unit, three AP-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft and a 

 Transit Security Element. 

 The work is difficult, dangerous and unrelenting.  

 The men and women who are deployed on Operation RESOLUTE do an  outstanding job under intense scrutiny.
