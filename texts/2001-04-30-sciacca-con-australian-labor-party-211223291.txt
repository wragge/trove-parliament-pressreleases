 Howard Government Acknowledges Benefits Of Immigration Con Sciacca - Shadow Minister for Immigration

 Media Statement - 30 April 2001

 Federal Labor has welcomed the Government's Migration Program for 2001-02, and particularly the acknowledgment that immigration provides Australia with substantial economic benefits and increased living standards.

 In response to the Government's announcement, Shadow Minister for Immigration Con Sciacca said that while the program lacked any real innovation or vision, he welcomed the Government's acknowledgment that immigrants are not a drain on the economy but indeed provide significant economic and social benefits.

 "The changes to the program itself are no surprise as Minister Ruddock has simply continued his steady as she goes attitude," Mr Sciacca said.

 "The Government's own figures show that immigration will benefit the economy by some $3.7 billion over the next four years.

 Mr Sciacca also welcomed the Government's decision to maintain the refugee and humanitarian program for the next financial years at its current levels of 12000.

 "Regardless of the composition of the actual program, it is important that Australia maintains its place in the world as one of the most generous resettlers of refugees and I welcome the fact that the Government acknowledges the importance of Australia's role as a responsible, global citizen in this respect," Mr Sciacca said. Authorised by Geoff Walsh, 19 National Circuit, Barton ACT 2600.
