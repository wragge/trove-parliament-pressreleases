 THE HON BRENDAN O’CONNOR MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP   

 MEDIA RELEASE

 TURNBULL EXPOSES MORRISON’S LIES ON TURNING BACK BOATS   

 Confusion continues to reign over the Coalition’s asylum seeker policy with Malcolm Turnbull last  night contradicting immigration spokesperson Scott Morrison regarding their controversial tow-backs policy.    

 On ABC’s Q&A, Mr Turnbull said the Coalition would return boats only to the edge of Indonesian  waters, so not to engage the Indonesian navy and expect crews carrying desperate asylum seekers  to return to port on their own steam.   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL - Q&A - 10 JUNE 2013  If seaworthy asylum seeker boats are taken back to the limit of Indonesian territorial waters,  escorted back there and then left there, so their only option is to return to Indonesia, then  the Indonesian navy is not engaged because it is not occurring in Indonesian territorial  waters.   

 Last week, Mr Morrison stated Coalition policy would be to return boats directly to Indonesian ports  which Indonesian authorities have declared they would never cooperate with.   

 SCOTT MORRISON - SKY NEWS - 5 JUNE 2013   

 MORRISON: The policy of Indonesia boats returning to Indonesian waters from the ports  from which they came, occurred under the Howard Government. It’s not a fiction, it’s a fact.  It’s actual history.   

 QUESTION: That’s history, it’s not today though.   

 MORRISON: That arrangement took place and there was no arrangement around that  either.    

 The Coalition’s turn back policy is more slogan than solution and will not stop the people smuggler  trade but will put Navy personnel at risk.   

 The Indonesian Government made this crystal clear last month it would not be possible for the  Coalition to return boats to Indonesia.   

 INDONESIAN AMBASSADOR - 31 MAY 2013  The target of turning back the boats is not Indonesia. It should be going to other countries, to  the countries of origin of the people.    

 Indonesia is a transit country and we are also the victim of this situation. I think it’s not  possible for the Coalition to say that it has to go to Indonesia.   

 No such collaboration will happen between Indonesia and Australia (to) bring back the  people to Indonesia.
