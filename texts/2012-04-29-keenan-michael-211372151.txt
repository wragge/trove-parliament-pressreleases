 GILLARD DELIVERS BUDGET SURPLUS FOR PEOPLE  SMUGGLERS AS $1.6MILLION BOAT ARRIVES 

 Posted on Sunday, 29 April, 2012

 The illegal arrival of the largest boat in more than two years, carrying 170 people, will yield more than  $1.6  million  for  people  smugglers  highlighting  that  their  trade  is  roaring  under  Labor's  soft  border   policies,  Shadow  Minister  for  Immigration  and  Citizenship,  Scott  Morrison  and  Shadow  Minister  for   Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "The only  budget surplus the Gillard Government has delivered has been for the people smugglers,  with illegal boat arrivals continuing to surge in 2012," Mr Morrison said. 

 "More than 940 people have turned up on 12 illegal boats so far this month, with the latest carrying 170  people, the largest in more than two years. More people have turned up by boat since Anzac Day than  in the last six years of the Howard Government," he said. 

 "Labor has simply given up on border protection and given in to the Greens, continuing to soften policy. 

 "Labor's 'let them in, let them out' policy has supercharged the people smugglers’ product, with more  than 3,300 people turning up on 42 boats since the introduction of Labor's community release plan for  single male asylum seekers on bridging visas. 

 "Labor's only answer is to offer lame excuses and to seek to blame others for their own hopeless policy  failures. After more than 300 illegal boat arrivals Labor still cannot accept responsibility," Mr Morrison  said. 

 Mr  Keenan  said:  "With  the  arrival  of  the  second  boat  in  as  many  days  it  is  clear  that  the  people   smugglers have well and truly cemented their control over Australia's borders. 

 "The  hard  working  men  and  women  of  our  Border  Protection  Command  continue  to  face  an  uphill   battle with no support from Labor. 

 "When our country  is facing a complete crisis at our borders, it seems the only  response Labor  can  offer is an excuse. 

 "The Gillard Government can no longer afford to ignore one of the principle roles of the Commonwealth  â protecting our borders," Mr Keenan said.
