 MEDIA RELEASE

 THE BEIJING MASSACRE - THE PLIGHT OF POSSIBLE  AUSTRALIAN VICTIMS .

 On June 4 many Australians will show their concern at the events  in Beijing one year ago. '

 The memorial service for victims held at Parliament House, was  a moving occasion.

 No doubt the overnight vigil and the candlelight ceremony from  the new Chinese Embassy to Parliament House will be equally a  testament of Australian concern about the bloody suppression  of student aspirations in Tienanmen Square.

 Like many Australians I will again support those in Australia  who will not suffer compassion fatigue.

 The questions on notice that I have put to the Government remain  unanswered. It is, however, clear that very few, if any, of  the thousands of applications for refugee and humanitarian  resident status in Australia from PRC nationals have been  considered. Continued procrastination and delay have left 

 large numbers of PRC national students suffering financial  and personal difficulties in determining their future.  Case-by-case determination of their claims is the only just  and proper way to proceed. It is an indictment on the  Government that twelve months after those tragic events . 

 the necessary administrative arrangements cannot be properly  developed and put in place.

 While resource demands might be significant, a re-ordering of  priorities can always be undertaken.

 The flawed introduction of migration regulations and the  administrative chaos their implementation created is of  course only another factor which demonstrates the total  and abysmal failure of the Hawke Government in the 

 administration of immigration.

 In the case of the Chinese students, they are the visible  manifestation of this maladministration.
