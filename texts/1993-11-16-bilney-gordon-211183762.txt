 Ministep for Development Coopepation Minister for Pacific Island AffairsGordon Bilney MPMDC 70 16 November 1993AUSTRALIA TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE TO BURUNDI REFUGEESAustralia is to provide $250,000 to the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees to assist with emergency relief for refugees from Burundi, the Minister for Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney, announced today."Following widespread violence in the wake of an attempted military coup, more than 630,000 people, about 10 per cent of Burundi's population, have fled the country seeking refuge in Rwanda, Tanzania and Zaire," Mr Bilney said."The President, several ministers and government officials were assassinated in the October coup. -"Since then fierce fighting has continued between the majority Hutu tribe, and the minority Tutsi tribe."The majority of the refugees are of Hutu origin, with women, children and the elderly making up 80 per cent of the refugee population," Mr Bilney said.Rwanda, the major country of asylum, was already very short of food and shelter, and conditions have been made worse by the onset of heavy rains which are hampering the relief effort.The refugee situation is placing similar strains on Tanzania and Zaire with only rudimentary facilities available for the needs of refugees.The Australian emergency relief funds are in addition to $7.5 million provided to the UNHCR as core funding for its general operations.CANBERRAFor further information contact:Richard Moore (Minister's Office 06277-7660 David Jones (AIDAB) 06276-4697COMMONWEALTHPARLIAMENTARY LIBRARYMICAH
