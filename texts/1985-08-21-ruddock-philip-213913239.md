 PRESS STATEMENT BY PHILIP RUDDOCK SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 Opposition Spokesman for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Philip Ruddock has attacked the Budget priorities of the  Government in the provision of funds for migrant services. '

 Mr Ruddock said that the increase by 38% in grants to  Tirade Unions to assist migrants was inappropriate and  reflected the political clout of unions and the preferences  of the Hawke Government.

 "While it is important that migrants in the workplace who  are disadvantaged by language and culture differences receive  assistance, the Unions, who collect substantial membership fees  should be prepared to commit a greater percentage of their own 

 funds for their own members need.

 "This significant increase should be seen against the cuts  to programs undertaken by voluntary and other community  groups, particularly for those working with refugees.

 "Such groups will suffer, in real terms, a 10.5% reduction.  Accommodation and services for refugees fell in real terms  by 2 8 % .  .

 "In total these cuts are proportionately higher than the  reductions in the size of the refugee program.

 Mr Ruddock said that the claim by the Minister that funds  to help migrants settle will increase in 1986 misrepresents  the impact of the budget generally on programs in Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs.

 "There are effective reductions in funding in many areas and  for an honest statement of the budgets effect these also should  have been highlighted.

 "Programs for initial settlement orientation activities for  migrants will be reduced by 46% in real terms from $147,402.00  to $90,000.00 and this is at a time when the migration program  has marginally increased.

 Grants to the Federation of Ethnic Communities Council and for migrant project subsidy payments are the same as last .

 year, therefore in real terms have been reduced.

 At a time when so much emphasis is placed upon reasonable  access to interpreters and translators, the contribution  to the National Accreditation Authority has suffered a  real 22% reduction. â
