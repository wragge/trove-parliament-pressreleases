 SENATOR FOR WA

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Canberra, 8 May 1990

 IMMIGRATION MINISTERS "HOODWINKED BY DEPARTMENT"

 The Australian Democrats' Deputy Leader, Senator Jean Jenkins   has blamed DILGEA bureaucrats for the fiasco of the   Government's botched immigration legislation.

 "If, as reported, the latest Minister, Gerry Hand, is about to   do a backflip on the regulations introduced in December, the   Government is a year late in moving in the right direction,"   Senator Jenkins said.

 [In May. 1989, Senator Jenkins proposed 42 amendments to the   legislation, all of which were rejected when the Coalition   parties entered an accord with the Government to ignore   vigorous Democrat objections.]

 "The legislation and the much-vaunted regulations have totally   failed to achieve the objectives trumpeted by former   Minister, Senator Ray, in December 1988.

 "I agreed then that what was needed was a set of   understandable, fair, sensible guidelines which would enable   the making of prompt, fair decisions and allow entry to people   on genuine humanitarian grounds.

 "What the Department wants— and what has been foisted on to;   the Parliament— is a cruel, methodical way of classifying   people according to economic criteria without regard for the   reunion of Australian families or the life and limb of   refugees who may be handed back to punitive regimes.

 "The bureaucrats of the Immigration Department have hoodwinked   a succession of Ministers, with Senator Ray as their most   gullible victim," Senator Jenkins said. 7230 ends
