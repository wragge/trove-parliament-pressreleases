 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION  AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 MPS 30/87 EMBARGOED - NOT FOR 

 PUBLICATION BEFORE 1300 HOURS  THURSDAY JUNE 11, 1987

 GOVERNMENT IMMIGRATION PROGRAM RESPONSIBLE AND FAIR

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mick Young,  today announced that Australia would accept 120,000 new  settlers in 1987/88.

 This represents an increase of 5,000 over the revised planned  total for the current year. 1987/88 will thus be a year of  consolidation for the immigration program which has seen rapid  growth in the past two years.

 Mr Young said that "the Government supports an expansive  immigration program. However, the most appropriate and  responsible strategy is to plan for steady moderate annual  increases commensurate with the economic and social situation  within this country.

 "Immigration is essential to Australia's long term social and  economic development", Mr Young stated. "This is recognised  and supported by all political parties and, I believe, widely  accepted in the community."

 Refugee and Special Humanitarian Programs

 "Australia has a fine record in resettling people under the  Refugee and Special Humanitarian Programs", Mr Young said. "On  a per capita basis, we have taken more than our share, and the  Government remains committed to fulfilling humanitarian  obligations and to working within the international arena to 

 find political solutions to the world's refugee problem."

 Mr Young said that "although the Government remains committed  to orderly departure arrangements such as family migration from  Vietnam, we have to recognise the continuing ned for refugee  settlement thus we will maintain a Refugee and Special  Humanitarian intake of 12,000."

 Skilled and Business Migration

 In skilled migration, the emphasis will continue to shift  progressively away from indirect recruitment under the  Occupational Shares System to the more direct approach of the  Employer Nomination Scheme.

 Government initiatives in training and education programs are  reducing reliance on overseas skills to meet local needs. The  planned intake under the Occupational Shares System will  therefore be lowered from 10,000 to 8,000. "The reduction 

 reflects general labour market stability as well as  improvements in training programs such as apprenticeships which  have increased from an all-time low of 38,000 four years ago to  well over 51,000 in 1985/86", Mr Young pointed out.

 The intake under the Employer Nomination Scheme, on the other  hand, will respond to demand. "However, if we find that our  reduced entry under the Occupational Shares System causes  problems in certain industries, we will maintain discretion to 

 fill places in consultation with employers and unions", Mr Young assured.

 "The Business Migration Pr'ogram is a key element in emphasising  the economic benefits of migration, through investment and job  creation. This year the program outcome will be nearly double  the previous year, and next year we propose to increase it 

 further to 3,500 persons. The strong response from business  migrants from SE Asia will increasingly be complemented by  efforts to diversify into N. Asia to reinforce major trade .   links, Europe, the Middle East and N. America."

 Family Migration

 "While the Government recognises the importance of attracting  immigrants who will be able to contribute skills and  entrepreneurship to the Australian economy, we consider it  equally important to meet the social objectives involved in the  entry of people with close family ties in Australia", Mr Young  said.

 "In the Independent and Concessional category, for example, an  increase of 7,000 has been planned to again facilitate entry of  nieces and nephews of Australian residents."

 Other changes to, and description of, immigration categories  are attached. However, from the above it is clear that, within  the overall expansion of the program, careful account has been  taken of competing pressures within the community. "A fine

 balance has been struck between promoting economic benefits  through skilled and business migration, on the one hand, and  maintaining humanitarian commitment to refugee settlement and  family reunion, on the other," Mr Young said.

 Mr Young concluded by drawing attention to one other important  aspect associated with increasing the immigration intake: "A major Government responsibility is to ensure that new  immigrants arriving in Australia receive adequate settlement  assistance. I am very pleased to announce, therefore, that the  Government has agreed to an additional resource allocation of 

 $3.2 million toward this end. This includes an additional 15  staff to administer settlement services."

 met. Applicants must: .
