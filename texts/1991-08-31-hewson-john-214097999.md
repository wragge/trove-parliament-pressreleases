 THE YUGOSLAV CRISIS

 Following is the message which Mr Paul Filing MP is delivering  on my behalf to the Croatian Rally being held in Canberra today:

 "The Federal Opposition is extremely concerned about the  escalating confrontation in Yugoslavia. We have urged all  parties in the conflict to show restraint and emphasised  that the crisis should be resolved through peaceful 

 negotiation.

 We have condemned the attacks by the Yugoslav army on 

 Croatia and Slovenia and called for the start of 

 negotiations to achieve their peaceful independence.

 The Opposition will continue to urge the Australian 

 Government and the international community to respond to  the scale of the crisis in Yugoslavia. We have put forward  firm proposals and taken action in the Federal Parliament  to give this grave situation the priority it deserves.

 We have consistently been urging the Australian  Government to support mediation efforts by the 

 European Community

 Since 6 August, we have called for involvement by the  United Nations to prevent escalation of the conflict

 We have called for action by Australia and 

 international community to help the estimated 125,000  Croatian refugees

 The Opposition's response to the crisis in Yugoslavia is  reflected in the Motion we moved in the Senate on 15 August  and which, despite Government objections, was passed on 22  August. The Motion states that the Senate:

 DEPLORES the violence, loss of life and destruction of  property that has taken place in Solvenia and Croatia,  where more than 300 civilians are reported to have 

 been killed, largely as a result of the attacks of  terrorists supplied by the Communist-led Federal Army  and attacks by the Army itself;

 NOTES the potential for further conflict if 

 aspirations for self-determination expressed through  democratic plebiscites in the Yugoslav republics are  confronted by military force; 

 E COMMC

 PARUAMEh Î'

 WELCOMES the efforts of the European Community (EC) to  act as a mediator to prevent further conflict;

 CALLS on the Australian Government to support 

 international efforts for a negotiated settlement  between the Yugoslav republics which will avoid  conflict, achieve the independence the peoples of  Croatia and Slovenia demand and protect the interests  of ethnic and religious minorities; and

 FURTHER calls upon the Australian Government to recall  its Ambassador to Yugoslavia for consultations on how  Australia might, consistent with a desire to preserve  peace, support the newly evolving independent states, 

 including the most appropriate time to give diplomatic  recognition".

 It is clear that Yugoslavia is breaking up. It is equally  clear that it cannot be held together at the point of a 

 gun.

 The use of the Yugoslav armed forces to resist the peaceful  break-up of Yugoslavia should be condemned. In particular,  central Government forces should be immediately withdrawn  from Croatia.

 In addition to what the Federal Opposition has already  advocated, the extent of the crisis is such that the 

 Australian Government should also

 provide humanitarian support directly into Zagreb in  the form of urgently needed medical requirements

 provide urgent Consular support in Zagreb in order  that Croatian people seeking Australian visas need no  longer apply through Belgrade

 The Federal Opposition will continue to urge the Hawke  Government to go beyond the rhetoric and take action to  actively support the moves which we have been urging 

 towards a ceasefire, a withdrawal of Yugoslav forces, and  a peaceful transition for Croatia and Slovenia to the  status of independent states.

 DR JOHN HEWSON MP"
