 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales 

 

 

 Burmese on Nauru should be given a fair assessment 

 Senator Nettle, 19th February 2007   

 Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today called on the government to stop  playing brinksmanship the Burmese asylum seekers on Nauru and process their claims  in good faith.    

 "The Burmese arrived over six months ago yet it seems they have not been processed  yet. If they'd been in Australia they would have been processed within 90 days," said  Senator Nettle.    

 "It seems the government does not want to give these people a fair hearing. It just  wants to send them back to Malaysia or to some other country. Notions of justice,  fairness and due process are being tossed away.    

 "The government should not be playing brinkmanship with asylum seekers - cajoling  them into a decision through a mixture of delay and threats.    

 "This is not the behaviour of a country that is a signatory and supposedly respects the  Refugee Convention.    

 "It seems the process on Nauru now amounts to wearing people down over time to the  point where they either do what the government wants or slowly lose their minds and  any hope.    

 "Minister Andrews should stop this cruel charade and bring these 8 people to  Australia and process them according to the normal laws and regulations."
