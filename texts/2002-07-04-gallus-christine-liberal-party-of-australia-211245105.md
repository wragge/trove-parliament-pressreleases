 Australia Pledges More Aid for Afghanistan

 Australia will provide $1.03 million to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to assist displaced Afghans return to their homes.

 'The IOM had earlier been forced to suspend its internal transport networks because of funding shortages, due in part to larger than expected numbers of returnees', the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Mrs Gallus said.

 'New funding pledges from Australia and other donors means the transport networks may now resume'.

 Australia has also recently made further allocations to Afghanistan to assist with recovery and reconstruction in the following areas:

 $4 million for basic education, specifically girls education âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» $1 million for agriculture and drug control âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» $1.1 million to IOM for the Jangalak Refugee Receiving Centre in Kabul to provide reception facilities and vocational training for Afghans returning to their homeland. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 $1 million for de-mining activities âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» $0.5 million for capacity building in the banking/finance sector âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» $0.5 million to be set aside for emerging priorities. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 'This brings the total assistance allocated to Afghanistan between September 2001 and July 1 2002 to $44.43 million,' Mrs Gallus said.
