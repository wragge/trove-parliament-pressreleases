 Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young  Monday 22nd July 2013   

 Statement: Immigration Department's photos of distressed refugees   

 “Today’s vulgar display from the Department of Immigration, in which it published photos of  distressed refugees being told of the government’s cruel PNG deal, truly is a move dredged up  from the bottom of the barrel,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The photos released today are further proof of the race to the bottom as Kevin Rudd continues  his race to the polls.   

 “It is shameful that this government is exploiting people’s private despair for cheap political  gain.   

 “The Australian Government should not be crowing about its willingness to breach international  law while mistreating refugees.   

 “The full cost of the government’s PNG deal, as well as any legal advice that it has received,  should be released immediately.”
