 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, BAXTER DETENTION CENTRE, SA, 18 JULY 2002

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 Subjects: Visit to Baxter Detention Centre; coast guard; asylum seekers; ALP Reform

 CREAN:  It’s been important to come here, that’s the first point that’s been made because the Labor Party is going through a comprehensive review in the way in which we treat asylum seekers and also the way in which we secure our borders.  My firm belief is that we need a comprehensive and lasting policy solution to both issues.  It has to be addressed, not just from the perspective of Australia’s interests, but international interests as well.  I think we can secure our borders better by getting an international framework for the processing of what is now a global problem - the flow of asylum seekers.

 But we’ve also got from that flow a dirty trade - people smugglers.  We have to crack down on the people smugglers.  The best thing to do with them is to stop them at source and that means having agreements by which their boats simply don’t leave their country of origin.

 We also need a US-style coast guard.  We need a cop on the beat to enforce the protection of Australia’s borders, not only against people smugglers but also against drug smugglers, also for quarantine purposes, also to protect our industries - our fisheries, for example.

 Having said that, the fact is asylum seekers can and do reach this country. Under this Government they’ve been reaching them in greater numbers until recently.  We therefore have to have a humane method by which people are processed and detained.  We know that the current solution has got great deficiencies.  I don’t think anyone believes that the Woomera Detention Centre is an appropriate facility.  Well, let me rephrase that - I think most people see serious problems with Woomera.  And we’ve called for the closure of Woomera.  If you’re going to close it you’ve got to have facilities for people to be held whilst the processing exercise is undertaken.

 What’s interesting about this place is that this has now been completed, it’s got no-one in it, and that’s important for this reason that you can look at a place with no-one in it.  It doesn’t tell the story of circumstances when people are in it.  So, whilst I think it’s been important to see the facilities and the lessons learnt of previous detention practices, I hope it’s a facility that doesn’t have to get used, quite frankly.

 We still have some questions that we’ve been talking with the appropriate authorities about and I have to compare notes with other colleagues within the Party who have had the opportunity to visit other detention facilities and to have views about this issue.  So, I’ll be taking the information away today that we’ve gathered.

 The final point that I would make is that the Government has also announced the building of the facility at Christmas Island which we have agreed with. The question really remains, what is the demand that the Government is anticipating whereby a facility like this for 1200 people is also going to be added to by another facility at Christmas Island that can accommodate similar amounts.

 I believe that we’ve got to get a lasting solution to this problem.  I’ve said the Government, a number of times, I repeat it again, the Labor Party is prepared to work with them to develop the appropriate policy response for that lasting solution.  I believe the policy framework does have to recognise that we do need high security detention facilities and we will be making our response the appropriate one.

 JOURNALIST:  (inaudible)

 CREAN: I don’t believe high security detention facilities are where kids should be kept.  I don’t believe that kids should be kept behind, in the past reference, the razor wire, the high security.  I think that we have to find a more humane way for dealing with them.  They are victims of circumstance. They obviously have to come with their parents who have been escaping.  But they are entitled to a decent education.  Every parent wishes that for their children.  It shouldn’t be any different in relation to these.

 JOURNALIST: (inaudible)

 CREAN: I wouldn’t use either of those terms.  But I think that we have to recognise that it’s not appropriate to keep them in high security detention facilities for very long periods of time.  I think we need a lasting solution.  It’s got to take account of the different circumstances.  The kids aren’t going to abscond on their own, particularly if parents, one or both of them, are still within the facilities.  So, I can’t see the risk in terms of children being able to be part of a broader community, not a detained community.

 JOURNALIST: Those who’ve absconded though, such as the two Woomera boys who gave themselves up today in Melbourne, what do you think should be done to them?

 CREAN: Well, I think, two things I would say about that.  Firstly, it highlights again that it isn’t appropriate to keep young kids behind, in their case, razor wire for, as I understand it, 18 months.  Having said that, these kids broke the law.  They broke out and they should not be able to break the law.  I think the other point that needs to be made is it does raise the question of what the circumstances are of the people running the facilities that enabled them getting out.  Now, I believe we’ve said this announcement already that the running of the facilities should be returned to ACM, to the government-run services.  I think that’s the appropriate way to run facilities and I haven’t seen the full details of the two young kids but the information that I’ve got to date leads me to those conclusions.  I need to get further details as to their circumstances.

 JOURNALIST: You say they’ve broken the law.  Should they be sent back here?

 CREAN: Well, I think if they have broken the law, if the law has been broken, they need to comply with it.  The circumstances for that will depend upon what the law is and if the law says they shouldn’t be held in high security detention for long periods of time, that should be taken into account in their case because they have been within a facility for 18 months, as I understand it.  I think it depends very much on the circumstances, they are details that I don’t have readily to hand and I will be following up on that.

 JOURNALIST: … British consulate to get asylum is a national embarrassment really.  Do you think that’s the truth?

 CREAN: Well, I don’t agree with that.  I mean, they are obviously looking for refuge, looking for refuge outside a facility that clearly they didn’t want to be in and in my judgment didn’t deserve to be in for the length of time they had been.  But I think it is the great irony that for those who say everyone wants to seek asylum here, here we have those who sought asylum here seeking it elsewhere now.

 JOURNALIST: … against people who might have assisted these boys and others in either escaping or seeking this type of asylum.

 CREAN: I don’t think anyone who assists others break the law should go without incurring the appropriate penalties.

 JOURNALIST: Just regarding trade union input to the Labor Party - do you feel you are moving back to the Accord and giving them a seat at the table, so to speak?

 4

 CREAN: I have never heard such a naive interpretation in my life. The trade unions have always had an input into the Labor Party.  They will always have an input.  If the Government was smart they would enable them to have a constructive input into their deliberations.  What is the Government saying - you should never sit down with trade unions and talk to them?  Now, I happen to believe the correct approach is to open dialogue with all groups in the community.  One of those groups happens to be the trade union movement.  I will continue to have dialogue with them because I think they are a force for constructive change in our community.  They represent working families, so does the Labor Party.  We have a lot in common.  We will develop common agendas but we will also develop them with the broader community.

 JOURNALIST: In the public’s eye do you think it makes Labor look too close to the union?

 CREAN: The Labor Party is an inclusive Party.  I have called for its modernisation.  I have called for it to reach out to all groups in the community.  Once you get a Government saying that consultation shouldn’t occur with anyone, it’s a narrow Government indeed.  It’s a bad Government, it’s not for good governance of this country.  I am for modernising the country for developing policies that relate to people’s aspirations, that relate to people’s futures.  We will only do that if we include groups in the community that represent them.  The trade unions are an important part of that but they are not the only part of it and I will be developing dialogue with all sorts of groups in the community.

 Just let me work the process through, you will see the final result all in due course and I wish at times that people who write these stories, who know little about the detail, come to simplistic conclusions as to what the end result is.  All in due course it will be revealed.  I am about modernising the Labor Party.  I will not be deterred in that regard.  There will be no sweetheart deals.  I am about constructive outcomes, positive directions to take this country forward.

 JOURNALIST: The case of the two Woomera boys, their father and the entire family fled from Afghanistan before they arrived in Australia and were processed and found to be genuine refugees.  The mother and her children are found, at this stage, not to be refugees.  Do you think this sort of case sends a bizarre message to the public about the process?

 CREAN: Well again, I don’t know the circumstances.  I understand what you have said to be the case.  I just need better detail on that.  If it is the case, it’s a dimension to it that has to be worked through.  I would much prefer to get a fuller briefing on the circumstances before I responded in any final way.

 I don’t think people do want families split up.  I think that Australians are a caring community and they care for families and their connection, so obviously we have circumstances to deal with on the particularities of this case.  Let’s investigate them and let’s come up with a considered solution, not a knee-jerk one.  I think it needs a considered solution and I think the great pity at times in terms of people and their response to asylum seekers is that too often people can make knee-jerk responses which they subsequently will regret.

 JOURNALIST: (inaudible) … said it’s very humane.  What do you say to that?

 CREAN: Well, there are no people in it so how can he talk about humanity when there are no humans in it.  I think that is just a silly statement.  I think it has been important to see the facilities as we have today.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister has allowed us the opportunity and you in.  I have called for these types of facilities in the circumstances under which people are held to be given greater scrutiny, greater access to the media, so long as it’s not abused, but I think there is a right to know because there is a community concern out there.  The more information the better.  I don’t think it is appropriate to go rating these facilities because I don’t think that we can consider this in isolation from the broader solution. These are comprehensive solutions - we do need high security detention facilities.  What we have got to do though is get a lasting solution that obviates the need to use them.

 JOURNALIST: (inaudible)

 CREAN: It’s been a pretty big drawing board and it has a lot of drawing over it so far.  I indicated that we were going through a major policy review of all of our policies, this included.  We will be making our announcement of that in the coming months.

 JOURNALIST: (inaudible) … valid criticism.

 CREAN: Well, I think it could be a valid criticism.  Of course it can be changed but I must say that is one of the issues I would like to take up further and perhaps directly with the Minister.  I think there is no point being offensive about these things needlessly but let’s see what that response is.  I have heard of the criticisms and the concerns only since I have been about Australia in the last couple of days but I will take those on board and pursue them through the appropriate channels.
