 ‘PACIFIC SOLUTION’ NOW JUST AN EXPENSIVE FARCE   

 Labor notes the Government’s decision to grant Aladdin Sisalem, the lone asylum seeker  on Manus Island, a protection visa which will allow him to live in Australia.   

 Once Mr Sisalem departs Manus Island next week, the immigration detention facility will  be empty.   

 Senator Vanstone has confirmed that despite the fact empty it will be empty, the facility  will remain operational.   

 The Government revealed during Senate Estimates this week that the cost to the  Australian taxpayer to keep the facility running for one detainee was $250,000 a month.   

 The Government also indicated that even if the facility was empty it would be operational  at the same cost of $250,000 a month until the agreement with the Papua New Guinea  Government ended in October.     

 When quizzed further by Labor, the Government admitted that it might extend the  operation of the facility beyond October.   

 We are now in the ridiculous situation where the Howard Government is prepared to  spend $1.25 million of taxpayers’ money to keep the empty Manus Island facility open  until October. 

 

 The cost of keeping the detention centre running each month is equivalent to over 9,700  bulk billed GP visits, or a total of 48,500 bulk billed GP visits until the end of October.   

 The Government also confirmed at Senate Estimates that it has now spent $200 million  dollars of taxpayers’ money on the so called ‘Pacific Solution’, and has budgeted for  another $85.3 million for the next financial year, and anywhere up to $300 million in 

 forward estimates.   

 The ‘Pacific Solution’ is a ridiculously expensive farce and the Government should end it  immediately.
