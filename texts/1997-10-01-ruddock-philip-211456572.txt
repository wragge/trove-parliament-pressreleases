  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  The Hon Philip Ruddock MP  Parliament House, Canberra ACT 2600  Telephone (02) 6277 7860 Facsimile (02) 6273 4144 

  MPS 93/97  $7.1m. funding boost for NSW settlement services  "The Government has demonstrated its commitment to regional Australia with community grants  commencing today to organisations which serve regional, rural and remote communities" the Minister  for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today. 

  The successful New South Wales organisations who help migrants and humanitarian entrants to settle  in Australia, were announced by the Minister on 28 August as a $7 135795 package of awards under  the Community Settlement Services (CSS) Scheme and the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement  Strategy. 

  "The funding is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to helping migrants and refugees  settle quickly into their new community, including people outside the major metropolitan areas," said  Mr Ruddock. 

  "The new grant arrangements focus on meeting community needs while at the same time ensuring the  Government and community receive value for money." 

  Mr Ruddock said NSW had received 162 awards which included funding for 41 projects around the  State. 

  "More than 26 per cent of the awards have gone to organisations serving regional, rural and remote  communities ofNSW. These include the Newcastle and Hunter Migrant Resource Centre, the  Bathurst Information and Neighbourhood Centre, the Multicultural Access and Resource Centre at  Newcastle, the Woolgoolga Neighbourhood Centre and the Illawarra MRC. 

  "Many of these projects involve advising new arrivals where they can obtain information that will  make their settlement in Australia easier," the Minister said. 

  "In particular, many of the rural grants will enable groups to provide direct assistance to new arrivals,  while other grants are aimed at ensuring people know where to go for the right advice and guidance." 

  The Minister said the money would help fund: 

   " information and referral services for recent arrivals, particularly from small and emerging  communities and in rural NSW;   " specific service provision and case management for refugees and other humanitarian entrants  " support for high-need groups such as humanitarian entrants, those who entered under the Woman-at-Risk program, and refugee minors; and  " support services for young people, women and elderly migrants. "This package of funding reflects the Government's commitment to providing services which help migrants and humanitarian entrants settle in their new country and quickly become contributing members of our community," Mr Ruddock said. 1 October 1997 Media inquiries: Steve Ingram (02) 6277 7860 [Full list of grants] [Media Release index] [ Home Page]
