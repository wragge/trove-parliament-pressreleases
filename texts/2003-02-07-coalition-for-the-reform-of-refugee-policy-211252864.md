  Prime Minister John Howard must tell ritish PM Tony lair next week ‘chat Australia  will not support British plans to withdraw from the 1951 Geneva Convention on  refugees, the Coalition for Reform of Refugee Policy said today. 

  This week the UK newspaper The Guardian has revealed that the Blair government is  considering curtailing or withdrawing from the 1951 Geneva Convention on refugees,  a move that would, according to leaked UK government documents published in The  Guardian, lead to a collapse of the current system of international protection for those  seeking asylum. 

  CRRP spokespeople Greg Barns and Andrew Macleod said today: 

  “The revelations in The Guardian this week are extremely disturbing. If the UK  withdraws or seeks to curtail its obligations under the Geneva Convention to offer  protection to asylum seekers and refugees then other countries may see this as a  green light and follow suit. 

  Its ironic that Mr Blair should be proposing this at the same time as he supports a  military conflict in Iraq which, the UNHCR, has estimated is likely to lead to 900,000  refugees wanting protection from countries such as the LJK and Australia that are  signatories to the Geneva Convention. 

  John Howard should tell Tony Blair that whilst some reform of international refugee  policy is welcome if it leads to an improved outcome for asylum seekers and  refugees, withdrawing or curtailing existing obligations is not the way to achieve this  aim. 

  We would also urge Mr Howard and Immigration Minister Mr Ruddock to rule out  completely any plans to consider the type of action that Mr Blair is contemplating,” Mr  Barns and Mr Macleod concluded.
