 Lack of public transport hinders young Tassies: Poll

 Many young Tasmanians believe public transport is inadequate, Senator Natasha Stott  Despojas annual Youth Poll survey has shown. The poll revealed a lack of public transport affects more than half of Tasmanian respondents,  curtailing their access to services, activities and socialising. "Maintaining social networks is necessary for the health and wellbeing of young people,  particularly those in isolated regions. In order to achieve this, they must have easy access to  transport," Senator Stott Despoja said. "It is encouraging that the Tasmanian Government has initiated a strategy to address this  problem." The poll also revealed that many young peoples lives are touched by tragedy with more than  half of young people knowing someone who had attempted or committed suicide. Other major issues for young people this year include: increased university fees (65% say  increased HECS fees will discourage them from attending university); reconciliation (71%  believe the Government should enter into a treaty with Indigenous Australians); and, access to  contraception (80% want young people to have access to free birth control).  "A significantly higher percentage of respondents than last year (60% compared to 42%) do not  support the mandatory detention of asylum seekers.  "For more than a decade, Youth Poll has provided young people with a forum to express their  views on a range of topics," Senator Stott Despoja said.  Other State specific findings include: an overwhelming 85% of New South Wales respondents  do not want a night curfew for P-platers; 74% of South Australian respondents do not support  the impounding of cars playing loud music or doing burnouts; and, 68% of respondents from  Western Australia reject the increasing of the school leaving age.
