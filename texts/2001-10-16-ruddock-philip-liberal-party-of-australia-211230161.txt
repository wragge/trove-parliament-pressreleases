 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS   16 October 2001

 Doorstop in Adelaide

 re: response to ALP boat policy - Coastguard and Indonesia

 QUESTION:

 Mr Beazley says he will send Ministers to Jakarta to thrash out a deal to get the boat people to be turned back to Indonesia for processing there. Is that going to work?

 MINISTER:

 Look, obviously if Indonesia was amenable, it would make a big difference, but Indonesia was burned when it was left with the Indonesian boat arrivals and did hold them up for us and declined to be involved in programs of that sort again. And there is no prospect that Indonesia sees its responsibility as to operate detention centres off-shore for us. And so we know the answer, the answer will be no.

 So the next question is, what more has Mr Beazley got to offer? He has no ideas, he’s been in Opposition… part of the problem and not part of the solution. It was Beazley’s team that opposed judicial review reform for four years. If that legislation had been passed, we would never have had in place the court-determined, wider acceptance of refugee applicants in Australia which became the signal to the smugglers to target Australia. And for four years we were delayed the passage of legislation that would have enabled us to deal with those expectations.

 And the only other idea he seems to have is that you re-badge the Navy - you strip it apart of its resources …

 QUESTION:

 I’ve seen another report his morning pointing to concerns within the navy about the Coastguard proposal.

 MINISTER:

 Well, I mean the navy is right to be concerned. If you’re not prepared to make a commitment of billions of dollars to build in a new service with new equipment, all you can do is rip resources out of the Navy and repaint them, and Beazley’s Coastguard proposal is a re-badging of naval resources and it’s little wonder that the Navy sees that, essentially as gutting it of its career paths for its staff and personnel and

 depriving it of resources which can be used not only for dealing with unlawful arrivals but also with the wider objectives that the Navy would normally pursue.
