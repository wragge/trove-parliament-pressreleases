 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 05 August 2002  MEDIA RELEASE                          02/382

 Studies needed:  impact of detention on children The Australian Democrats backed calls made today for funding to be made available to establish independent research into the effect of detention on children.  

 Australian Democrats Spokesperson for Immigration Senator Andrew Bartlett said, “Evidence given at the National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention highlighted the need for a comprehensive study into the operation of detention centres.”  

 “The detention policy has been in place for over ten years. It is a policy, which has been criticised repeatedly. Time and time again inquiries like this have raised concerns, but there has been no attempt to research and develop adequate responses to these concerns.  

 “I cannot stress enough how important a project like this is for Australia. It is imperative that data on the health and mental health of children in detention is collected and assessed as soon as possible, and at a central point,” said Senator Bartlett.  

 “Right now the responsibility for children is shared by multiple agencies. It is impossible to assess how specific incidents have impacted on children; what the long-term implications of those impacts might be, and what services are needed to intervene to assist.  

 “It must be remembered that Australia is the only country in the world that places children in long term detention. It is obligated to ensure there are no long-term effects of this policy on detainees.

 “The fact that repeated inquiries have found that detaining children breaches the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention Against Torture should have been enough to prompt the Howard Government to act to assess what the long-term damage to children is. But it didn’t.  

 “This is incredible, particularly considering that the majority of children in detention with their families will be granted refugee status. And many others have already settled permanently in Australia. It is in our and their best interests to protect their mental and physical health.” Senator Bartlett said.  

 Studies in depression and trauma have shown comprehensively that the response displayed by children in detention is in direct relationship to the situation their parents find themselves in.  

 Senator Bartlett said, “ It has been well documented that parents in detention are disempowered and deeply depressed; having suffered torture and trauma before arriving in Australia. The lack of control over their lives and continued uncertainty leads to further problems.  

 “It becomes a problem for the whole family with children as young as ten years of age, participating in acts of self-harm and taking prescription medication for depression.”  

 “The processes and outcomes from an independent study would be invaluable; strong indications exist here and now that there needs to be review of lines of authority, as well as a need for an independent monitoring process, including random inspections.

 “There is no doubt that further training is needed urgently for health professionals, teachers and the police in order to assist them with dealing with survivors of torture and trauma,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
