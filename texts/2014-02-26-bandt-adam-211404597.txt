 Media Release   

 Adam Bandt MP  Deputy Leader, Australian Greens  Federal Member for Melbourne   

 26 February 2014   

 Really? A man has died and we are talking about Senator  Conroy?: Bandt   

 Greens Deputy Leader, Adam Bandt MP, has criticised the House of  Representatives for wasting time with a politicised debate about Senator Conroy  instead of focussing on a far more pressing issue, the death of refugee Reza  Berati on Manus Island.   

 “Parliament has yet again missed the point,” said Mr Bandt.   

 “A man has been killed while in our care. We should be debating why this  happened and how we can stop it happening again, not wasting time in another  Liberal/Labor tit-for-tat.”    

 “Where is Parliament’s moral compass? Today’s politicised theatre was a waste  of everyone’s time.”
