 2004 Fulbright Symposium - Brisbane 5-7 July 2004   

 Civil - Military Interface - An AusAID Perspective   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 In  keeping  with  the  civilian  perspectives  theme  of  this  segment  of  the  2004  Fulbright   Symposium, 'Civil-Military Cooperation and the War on Terror', this paper seeks to provide an  AusAID  perspective  on  the  growing  interaction  between  civilian  and  military  actors  and  the   blurring of lines between their activities.     

 Whether  it  is  viewed  as  joined-up-government,  whole-of-government  or  a  dividend  from  a   globalised  and  more  connected  world,  the  facets  of  government  action  are  increasingly   interconnected.   And,  government  action  is  in  turn  strongly  inter-linked  with  national  and   international agendas - through both state and non-state actors.  In response, governments are  seeking more coherence in action to better manage processes and achieve national objectives.   A key example of coherence across government is the suite of actions comprising the so called  'War on Terror'.   For the Australian aid program this presents two challenges:   

 â¢ Responding to the underlying causes of instability and conflict that, in some  circumstances, might contribute to or exacerbate risks of instability; and   

 â¢ Providing humanitarian assistance and protection in conflict and post-conflict situations in  ways that do not undermine core humanitarian principles.    

 Within these broad fields, the civil-military interface is critical for the Australian aid program.   After  all,  conflict  is  a  multi-faceted  phenomenon  with  political,  economic,  security,  human   rights and humanitarian dimensions.  This paper concludes:  A more coherent and whole-of-government approach to complex emergencies is not simply humanitarian activities delivering  military  objectives  but  also  military  activities  appropriately  supporting  humanitarian   objectives.    The  Australian  Defence  Forces  and  other  arms  of  government,  in  particular   AusAID, need to address this at early and senior levels.    

 â¢ Greater connectivity of state and non-state actors makes responses to  instability and conflict everyone's business.   

 â¢ Civil-military cooperation is presenting a new challenge to both parties.   

 â¢ Cooperation is not only possible, but imperative.   

 â¢ Greater understanding and some flexibility - from both sides, are required.   

 â¢ Clarity of roles and a longer-term perspective maybe key.   

 â¢ If achieved, greater effectiveness/impact and more coherent action will ensue.

 The Context   

 The links between development and security have never been clearer1.  "Over three quarters of  the Australian development cooperation program's major bilateral programs operate in  countries that are vulnerable to, experiencing, or recovering from conflict"2.     

 The relationship between conflict and AusAID's core business - poverty reduction and  sustainable development - is readily apparent.There are many examples of conflict and  instability undermining growth prospects and hard-won development gains.  The Solomon  Islands, East Timor and Sri Lanka are examples in the immediate region with Afghanistan,  Sudan and Rwanda further afield.   As well, where governance is poor, poverty is endemic and  the capacity to deliver services is low, vulnerability to natural or man-made hazards and  conflict increases.   

 Traditionally in what is now commonly defined as complex emergencies3, the international  community has responded: i) firstly, to reduce or halt conflict, ii) then, to address humanitarian  needs, and iii), finally, to reconstruction and longer-term development needs.  Throughout this  process the overarching objectives of building peace and promoting reconciliation are the  cornerstones for achievement of growth, stability and prosperity.  The first and third of these  responses have historically involved discrete4 key actors, the military and development  professionals, respectively.  While the intermediate step, meeting humanitarian needs, has seen  a growing interaction between civil and military actors.  In particular, it is an arena populated  by a range of actors with starkly different philosophies and modalities.     

 However, both the development community and the military community are increasingly  seeing the process as a transition with inter-related actions.  As a consequence, humanitarian  workers and military units increasingly work, or seek to work, side by side in response to  crises.  The growing interaction between civilian and military actors is throwing up a raft of  new challenges that are discussed in this paper.     

 The relationship is, at times, uneasy and the current security environment of the "War on  Terror" has heightened fears amongst humanitarian agencies that the lines between  humanitarian objectives and politico-military objectives have become too indistinct.  As an  Australian Government Agency and also a key partner in the international humanitarian

  Peace Conflict and Development Policy, June 2002  3  The United Nations Inter-Agency Standing Committee defines a complex emergency as 'a humanitarian crisis in  a country, region or society where there is a total or considerable breakdown of authority resulting from internal  or external conflict and which requires and international response that goes beyond the mandate or capacity of any  single agency and/or the ongoing    4

  Increasingly this separation too is being questioned.  Development professionals and human rights practitioners  are briefing military leaders on human rights aspects and urging greater International Humanitarian Law skills and  capacities for military forces.  And, in the case of the Iraq War, development professionals were embedded in  primary military units to facilitate the peace-building process and early introduction of a development perspective.

 community, AusAID finds itself in the position of attempting to forge the necessary links that  will ensure that mutual goals of saving lives and relieving human suffering are achieved.   Necessarily, our approach, while informed by international principles, is pragmatic.  Our  primary concern is to maximise the impact of Australian Government humanitarian assistance - 

 not to impinge on the mandate or responsibilities of our partners within or outside government.   

 At the outset, it is worth noting that while military and humanitarian actors increasingly accept  the necessity of having to work more closely together, each maintain a cautious approach to  their cooperation.  The different perspectives sometimes culminate in an unfortunate clash of  cultures.  It is, however, symbolic of the maturation of the relationship that this symposium has  drawn participants together from both groups to share perspectives.     

 A stronger understanding of respective roles is important because people are being killed,  human suffering perpetuated and human dignity compromised if we do not work  collaboratively.  Preventing these occurrences is a responsibility of any humane society.      

 

 Australia Aid Program Role   

 The Australia aid program will provide an estimated $2.133 billion in 2004-055, of which some  $146 million is for humanitarian and refugee programs.  These funds are largely focused on the  Asia Pacific region.       

 The international community 6 has adopted through the Good Humanitarian Donorship  process, the following definition for humanitarian action:   

 The objectives of humanitarian action are to save lives, alleviate suffering and maintain  human dignity during and in the aftermath of man-made crises and natural disasters,  as well as to prevent and strengthen preparedness for the   occurrence of such situations.   

 

 The AusAID Humanitarian policy7 is informed by this definition and goes on to elaborate that:   

 The delivery of humanitarian assistance to all populations in need must be neutral,  impartial and independent and humanitarian workers must not take sides in disputes or  political positions.     

 

 5  Estimated Australian Official Development Assistance in 2004-05 is $2.133 billion, a 9.9 percent real increase  on the 2003-04 budget figure.  Australia has an ODA/GNI ratio of 0.26 percent placing it above the DAC donor  average.  Key themes of the aid program are: enhancing governance; increasing Asia-Pacific regional security;  maximising the benefits from globalisation; supporting stability through the delivery of essential services; and,  sustainable management of natural resources.    6

  The principles of Good Humanitarian Donorship were adopted by countries attending the 16-17 June 2003  meeting in Stockholm and have subsequently been trailed by the OECD Development Assistance Committee in its  2004 peer review process.  7

 The Challenges   

 There are many constraints to seamless civil-military cooperation in complex emergencies.   Chiefly among these is that it is exceptionally difficult for armed, uniformed participants in a  conflict situation to be considered neutral.  If neutrality and impartiality underpin humanitarian  action, the presence of weapons and uniforms at best confuse populations.  The advent of  Provisional Reconstruction Teams in Afghanistan and embedded humanitarian teams in Iraq,  further blur roles.  Winning the hearts and minds might advance military objectives, but is  there a cost (and is this acceptable) in humanitarian terms?      

 The Australian aid program's work, and that of humanitarian and development workers more  generally, is becoming more complex and more dangerous.  The United Nations Office of the  Coordinator for Humanitarian Affairs reports8 that in the 10 year period 1992 - 2001, 187 UN  humanitarian workers lost their lives while performing official duties.  A further 240 were  taken hostage or kidnapped9 in the same period.  Since 2001, over 70 additional UN  humanitarian personnel have lost their lives.     

 Non-UN humanitarian actors, including NGOs are also being targeted. The International  Committee of the Red Cross, MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res and others have been deliberately  targeted.  In formal United States estimates of attacks on UN and NGO humanitarian workers  point to a combined total of reported death is 2003 of 76 and 288 for the period 1997 - 2003.     

 What was once perceived as emblematic protection - be it the UN flag or the Red Cross, is  being eroded.  Both entities are spending considerable effort to understand this change and are  seeking to reverse it.   This direct targeting of humanitarian workers has rung alarm bells in the  community and curtailed humanitarian action is several instances.     

 What is causing this?  Is it that humanitarian workers are perceived as taking sides?  Is it that  humanitarian workers are associated with structures, symbols and institutions of the West?  Is  it a particularly violent tactic evolving in the conflict zone?  Is it that so called military  humanitarian action is confusing who is doing what in the field?  Or, is it just bad luck in a  growing and risky business?  The answer probably lies in a little bit of all of these elements -  and a few that are yet to be recognised.  I would be interested if others had views on this  aspect.   

 It is not too broad a generalisation to characterise the military ethos as a commitment to  overcome obstacles, conditions and opponents.  For humanitarian workers, there is also a  commitment to overcome obstacles and conditions.  But humanitarian workers do not speak of  "overcoming opponents".  This is crucial because it reflects the neutral, impartial and 

 independent character of humanitarian action, which defines and sustains vital "humanitarian  space".  Without this "humanitarian space", access to vulnerable populations is restricted and  the lives of humanitarian workers may be put at risk.

 In situations where the active humanitarian agencies draw funds and support from States or  communities that are parties to a war, it is only a small step to understand the ease with which  perceptions that these humanitarian organisations are somehow associated with active forces  are perpetuated.  This is true, even if these humanitarian agencies have strong, credible and  impartial records.  In such an instance, well-intentioned humanitarian workers then become a  potential source of threat to at least one set of warring parties.   

 There is also a strong culture within the humanitarian and development communities of  working with the community in question to overcome obstacles and conditions.  Indeed,  participatory planning, design and delivery is a common approach of development practitioners  and a fundamental principle of humanitarian action.  Humanitarian workers also see advantage  in empowering the object communities - something that might be inimical to military  objectives.    

 Like the military, humanitarian agencies speak of "end points" and "exit strategies" but for  humanitarian workers these are framed in terms of transitions (to recovery and development  assistance) and avoidance of dependency.  Central to these tenets of good humanitarian  practice are support to local capacities, traditional coping mechanisms and reduction of  vulnerabilities.  The aim is, as far as possible, to assist communities to meet their own needs  and set their own priorities rather than substituting for these responsibilities (except in the most  extreme circumstances) - an action that might destroy self-esteem and social cohesion and  create conditions of dependency.   

 Civil structures embrace flexibility of decision-making and the ability to revisit and change  both goals and methods.     

 High-cost, high-intensity and tightly-focused military action is carefully scripted and subject to  specific and tight timeframes.  It is, some notable exceptions notwithstanding, a short time  frame endeavour.  And, even when time frames are extended, the enduring approach and  rationale is short term.  Humanitarian action, reconstruction efforts and development programs 

 embrace and are more effective with a longer-term perspective.  Moreover, peace-building is  an incremental process that occurs over the medium to long term.  It is quite distinct from  peace-keeping which is a more immediate intervention aimed at preventing conflict.  In other  words, peace is more than the absence of conflict; it also involves the political, economic and  social rehabilitation of war-torn societies - a task that will take years if not decades.   

 If then these are some of the hurdles to civil-military cooperation, it is also incumbent to stress  the benefits of enhanced civil-military cooperation and the mechanisms through which  humanitarian agencies and military forces might interact in the theatre of a humanitarian crisis.   It must be acknowledged that humanitarian action depends on a threshold of security  guarantees.  Humanitarian agencies, no less than any other responsible employer, must  consider the safety of their employees.  Deployment of humanitarian workers into situations of  endemic strife in pursuit of noble but nevertheless idealistic goals is reckless and a dereliction  of duty of care.  The role of military peacekeepers in establishing a secure environment for  humanitarian operations cannot be contended.

 Humanitarian workers too need greater awareness and have adjustments to make.  The influx  of NGO and humanitarian organisations into Bam, Turkey, following the 2003 Earthquake and  the humanitarian presence in Afghanistan, to cite only two examples, support the view that  while well-intentioned, it does appear that there is a cavalcade of humanitarian workers ready  to follow the cameras.  Those who work in quieter situations and struggle to keep attention on  the forgotten emergencies must both marvel and deplore this asymmetric focus.        

 The logistic capacity of military actors is often over-accessed by humanitarian workers who  demand and expect transport at their request.   Strident demands for military support without  corresponding sharing of plans and appreciation for military requirements is a recipe for non-cooperation.  Impetuous demands for logistic support ('we need a Blackhawk') when it is clear  no real assessment of the need or of options as to how it might be met, build little confidence in  the civil sector capacity to differentiate and prioritise.  And, failure to appreciate the military 

 structure and its responsibilities in very difficult contexts does little to endear humanitarian  workers to their military counterparts.        

 

 The Good Humanitarian Donorship initiative6 to which Australia has subscribed contains a set  of 23 principles.  Principles 19 and 20 deal specifically with the interaction between civilian  and military actors:   

 "19. Affirm the primary position of civilian organisations in implementing  humanitarian action, particularly in areas affected by armed conflict.  In situations  where military capacity and assets are used to support the implementation of  humanitarian action, ensure that such use is in conformity with international  humanitarian law and humanitarian principles, and recognises the leading role of  humanitarian organisations.   

 20. Support the implementation of the 1994 Guidelines on the Use of Military and  Civil Defence Assets in Disaster Relief and the 2003 Guidelines on the Use of Military  and Civil Defence Assets to Support United Nations Humanitarian Activities in  Complex Emergencies"   

 The UN has adopted an approach to civil military coordination10 that relies heavily on  information sharing, a careful division of tasks, and when feasible, collaborative planning. This  approach envisions a coexistence relationship with the international militaries in most complex  emergencies and a cooperative relationship between the international civilian and military  responders in natural and technological emergencies. It is based on the fact that in the initial  phases of conflict situations military forces are extremely reluctant to include civilians in the  planning process and that in sudden onset natural and technological emergencies the  opportunity for planning is very limited.

 Draft Principles for Cooperation   

 Arising from these challenges, the following principles for civilian-military collaboration  might assist clarify roles:   

 â¢ Responsibility for humanitarian action be clearly vested with civilian humanitarian  structures to underscore the neutrality and impartiality of humanitarian action.    

 â¢ The maintenance of humanitarian space is linked to a clear distinction between the roles  and actions of military and humanitarian personnel.  Establish, clarify and reiterate these  roles.   

 â¢ Obtain agreement that a primary military role is to provide the secure environment in  which humanitarian action can be provided.   

 â¢ Develop strong and enduring coordination mechanisms between military and civilian  teams, programs and hierarchy.     

 â¢ While each group should be familiar with the other, there are limits on where collaboration  is possible. This is not, however, a prescription for incoherence.   

 â¢ Civil and military actors must work together to deal with defined symptoms of complex  emergencies to best impact on the underlying causes of conflict.   

 â¢ Peace-keeping and peace-building are two distinct but mutually reinforcing goals.   

 â¢ Seek military support, as a last resort, for secure logistic, transport and storage facilities.     

 

 What Are We Doing At Present?   

 Contact between the Australian aid program and the Australian Defence Force/Organisation  has been ongoing and profitable for some time.  While a number of these connections are ad-hoc, others have more substance and include: 

 

 - Giving presentations in the annual CIMIC course (next one is 27 Nov to 12 Dec  2004);   

 - Assisting with and presenting to the Australian Defence Force International Peace  Operations Seminar (July 2004);   

 - Joint responses to Pacific cyclones including AusASSISTPLAN and subsequent  responses involving Australian Defence Force resources involving FRANZ as  appropriate;   

 

  8

 - Co-located AusAID Disaster Store with Australian Defence Force at Moorebank;   

 - Membership of the Peace Operations Working Group;   

 - Participation in the Longreach series of exercises - which focus on disaster  response (next scheduled in Oct/Nov in Vanuatu and/or Tonga); and    

 - Most recently, participation in Defence Scientific and Technology Organisation  coordinated Effects Based Operations simulations.     

 

 

 We Need to Do Better   

 There is a need to clarify and strengthen civil-military cooperation in order to ensure  humanitarian action is effective, un-impeded and targeted on those most seriously affected by  conflict and crisis situations.      

 AusAID needs to strengthen links and understanding at both senior and operational levels of  the need for more collaborative efforts.  These will, of necessity, have real limits, but stronger  links can and should be made.      

 A more coherent and whole-of-government approach to complex emergencies is not simply  humanitarian activities delivering military objectives but also military activities appropriately  supporting humanitarian objectives.      

 This is being recognised through the Australian Defence Force trial of Effects Based  Operations Approach - essentially recognising that a joined-up world needs joined-up  government and for Australia this means civil and military elements working more closely  together.  The Australian aid program is a willing participant in this trial.
