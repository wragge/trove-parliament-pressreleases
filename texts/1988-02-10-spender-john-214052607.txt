 SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AFGHANISTAN: MR. GORBACHEV'S GAMBIT

 COMMONWEALTH   PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY C. I. s.

 SOVIET LEADER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF A TIME FRAME  FOR WITHDRAWAL OF SOVIET TROOPS FROM AFGHANISTAN SHOULD BE  GIVEN A GUARDED AND QUALIFIED WELCOME.

 AFGHANISTAN HAS BECOME A BLEEDING WOUND FOR THE SOVIET UNION  AND A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO THE EXECUTION OF SOVIET FOREIGN  POLICY, ESPECIALLY IN ITS RELATIONS WITH THE THIRD WORLD.

 MR GORBACHEV'S DETAILED STATEMENT IS CAST IN DELIBERATELY  AMBIGUOUS TERMS AND CONTAINS NO DEPARTURE FROM PAST SOVIET  JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THEIR INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN AND THE  BRUTAL AND BARBARIC WAR SOVIET TROOPS HAVE WAGED AGAINST THE  GREAT MAJORITY OF THE AFGHANISTAN PEOPLE.

 THE STATEMENT ALSO REEKS OF HYPOCRISY. MR GORBACHEV SAYS THAT  "PROGRESSIVE FORCES OF AFGHANISTAN SOCIETY HAVE UNDERSTOOD AND  ACCEPTED OUR SINCERE DESIRE FOR PEACE AND TRANQUILITY BETWEEN  OUR TWO NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES". THE OTHER FORCES - THE  MAJORITY OF THE AFGHANISTAN PEOPLE - HAVE LEARNT THROUGH THIS 

 LONG AND BITTER WAR THAT THE PEACE AND TRANQUILITY OF WHICH MR  GORBACHEV SPEAKS IS THE PEACE AND TRANQUILITY OF THE GRAVE, OF  THE DISPOSSESSED, AND OF THE FOUR MILLION REFUGEES FORCED BY  SOVIET TROOPS TO FLEE THEIR OWN COUNTRY.

 MR GORBACHEV'S STATEMENT RAISES FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT  THE FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN AND THE SOVIET ROLE IN ITS AFFAIRS.

 . MR GORBACHEV SAYS THAT THE FORM OF "NATIONAL RECONCILIATION" IS TO BE "NONE OF OUR BUSINESS". AN  AMAZING STATEMENT, GIVEN THE HISTORY OF THE BRUTAL WAR  WAGED OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS AND RUSSIA'S LONG STANDING 

 INTERESTS IN THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF AFGHANISTAN. DOES MR GORBACHEV REALLY MEAN THAT THE SOVIET UNION WILL  STAND MEEKLY ASIDE AND PLAY NO PART IN THE FORMATION OF  THE GOVERNMENT ITS TROOPS ARE TO LEAVE BEHIND THEM?

 . WHAT IS MEANT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF "NATIONAL RECONCILIATION"? HOW IS THIS GOVERNMENT TO BE FORMED? HOW CAN IT GENUINELY COMBINE SOVIET PUPPETS AND SUPPORTERS  OF THE PRESENT SOVIET BACKED REGIME AND ALL THOSE AFGHANS  WHO HAVE FOUGHT THAT REGIME AND SOVIET TROOPS FOR SO LONG  AND AT SUCH BITTER COST?

 â¢ are THE MUJAHEDDIN WILLING TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS? NOT A  WORD IS SAID BY MR GORBACHEV ABOUT CONSULTATION WITH THEM.  THE MOST RECENT CONSULTATION BETWEEN THE SOVIETS AND THE  MUJAHEDDIN WAS THE MAJOR ATTACK LAUNCHED ONLY A FEW WEEKS  AGO BY AN ESTIMATED 40,000 SOVIET AND AFGHAN REGIME TROOPS

 Î¯

 KHOST AREA, THIS IS A QUAINT NOTION OF CONSULTATION AND   NATIONAL RECONCILIATION - BUT ONE WE HAVE SEEN BEFORE   COMING FROM THE SOVIET UNION.

 ,  DOES MR GORBACHEV REALLY INTEND THAT THE AFGHANISTAN PEOPLE SHOULD BE FREE TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN POLITICAL   FUTURE? OR IS IT TO BE A CONDITION OF FUTURE SOVIET   NON-INTERFERENCE IN AFGHANISTAN'S AFFAIRS THAT IT SHOULD   MAINTAIN A GOVERNMENT WHOSE VIEWS AND ACTIONS ARE   ACCEPTABLE it) THE SOVIET UNION?

 .  WILL ALL SOVIET TROOPS PULL OUT OF AFGHANISTAN? OR ARE   ADVISERS TO BE LEFT? WHAT OF THE PUPPET REGIME'S OWN   ARMY? IS IT TO BE DISBANDED? ARE THE MUJAHEDDIN TO   BECOME PART OF IT? IF SO, HOW WILL THIS EXTRAORDINARY ACT  

 OF RECONCILIATION TAKE PLACE?

 .  WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS FOR AN ENDURING CEASE-FIRE BETWEEN   THE MUJAHEDDIN AND THE SOVIET TROOPS AND THE SOVIET BACKED   REGIME? WHAT GUARANTEES DO THE MUJAHEDDIN HAVE THAT, IF   THEY LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS, THEY WILL NOT HAVE THEIR WHOLE  

 FUTURE PUT AT RISK AND BE EXCLUDED BY THE EXISTING REGIME   FROM ANY ROLE IN THE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN?

 .  WHAT ARE MR GORBACHEV'S PROPOSALS FOR A PEACE-KEEPING   FORCE? GIVEN THE EXTRAORDINARY COST, BITTERNESS AND   BRUTALITY OF THE WAR WAGED OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, IS   NOT A PEACE-KEEPING FORCE ESSENTIAL IF A BLOOD BATH IS TO   BE AVERTED? FROM WHAT COUNTRIES WILL THAT FORCE BE DRAWN?

 .  WHAT COUNTRIES ASIDE FROM THE SOVIET UNION AND PAKISTAN   ARE TO BE THE POLITICAL PLAYERS IN MR GORBACHEV'S   PROPOSALS TO DISENGAGE SOVIET TROOPS AND TO ESTABLISH A SO   CALLED GOVERNMENT OF "NATIONAL RECONCILIATION"? IN  

 PARTICULAR, WHAT ROLE IS IRAN TO PLAY? MR GORBACHEV HINTS   AT A POLITICAL ROLE FOR IRAN IN HIS SETTLEMENT PROPOSALS,   BUT DOES NOT SPELL IT OUT.

 A CESSATION OF THE HOSTILITIES WHICH HAVE PLAGUED AFGHANISTAN   FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS, WHICH HAVE COST SO MANY LIVES AND SO   MUCH SUFFERING IS DEVOUTLY TO BE WISHED. THE DIFFICULTIES   FACED IN PROCURING A GENUINE RECONCILIATION AMONG THE  

 AFGHANISTAN PEOPLE ARE IMMENSE, WE HOPE THAT SUCH A   RECONCILIATION CAN BE EFFECTED.

 BUT IT SHOULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN THAT THE MISERY OF THE LAST   EIGHT YEARS HAS BEEN THE DIRECT RESULT OF SOVIET FOREIGN   POLICY AND ITS ARMED AGGRESSION, THE SOVIET PROPOSALS TO   WITHDRAW ARE ACTUATED NOT BY ANY LOVE OF PEACE AND FREEDOM,

 BUT BY THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT'S OWN JUDGEMENT OF ITS

 SELF-INTEREST AND THE GROWING AND INTENSE DOMESTIC DISLIKE OF  THE WAR WITHIN THE SOVIET UNION.

 LASTLY, THE WHOLE PROPOSAL RAISES AN INTRIGUING QUESTION  CENTRAL TO SOVIET AND IMPERIAL RUSSIA'S HISTORICAL CONCERNS.  IS THE SOVIET UNION REALLY WILLING TO SEE THE CREATION ON ITS  SOUTHERN FLANK OF A POWER VACUUM IN AN AREA OF HISTORIC AND 

 FUTURE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE TO IT? ASIDE FROM ITS GREAT  STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE TO THE SOVIET UNION, AFGHANISTAN FORMS  PART OF A RING OF ISLAMIC NATIONS WHOSE VERY PROXIMITY TO A  LARGE AND GROWING SOVIET ISLAMIC POPULATION PRESENTS A SOURCE  OF POTENTIAL DESTABILISING TO THE SOUTH-EASTERN REGION OF THE 

 SOVIET UNION.
