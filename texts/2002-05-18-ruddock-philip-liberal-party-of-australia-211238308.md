 Newspaper Report Wrong on Deal with US MPS 35/2002

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock said that a newspaper report today on a claimed refugee swap with the United States of America was wrong.

 No special deal has been done for Australia to resettle people from Haiti and Cuba in return for the USA taking people from Nauru and Papua New Guinea. Burden sharing is a long established aspect of the refugee system and while Australia will do its part in other regions of the world, it also expects other countries to share the burden in our region.

 Australia had agreed to assist the USA in the resettlement of a small group of people from Haiti, but this is not an uncommon occurrence between refugee resettlement nations and it was speculation by the reporter that it was part of a deal.
