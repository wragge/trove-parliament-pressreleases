 DOCTORS WILL COP PATIENT ABUSE "The proposed changes in tonight's budget will mean that our sickest and most needy patients will be slugged even more for their life saving medications. Our patients are already grumbling about the cost of their necessary medications and they will now be hurting even more" said DRS NSW president Dr Con Costa today.

 " As a working GP, I know I will be copping a lot of abuse from my patients tomorrow and they will be justified" he said.

 "All Australian doctors will have to deal with frightened patients tomorrow, worried about the cost of their medications. Most sick and elderly patients are now on multiple drugs for diabetes, heart disease, asthma and blood pressure and are continually hounded by their doctor about the importance of taking them regularly" said Dr Costa.

 "It seems grossly unfair that the Government is now asking the sickest and most needy to pay for Navy border patrols to stop desperate asylum seekers" said Dr Costa.
