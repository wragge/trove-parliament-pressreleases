  INQUIRY INTO RETURN OF 
PREGNANT WOMAN TO CHINA

  

  

  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today announced that the in dependent Inquiry instituted on May 
10 to thoroughly examine allegations surrounding the treatment of a 
PRC national following her return to China, would be conducted by Mr 
Tony Ayers, AC.

  

 Mr Ruddock said Mr David Sadleir, who was to have 
undertaken the Inquiry, withdrew from this assignment due to the pressure 
of other professional commitments which needed his full attention.

  

 “Mr Ayers is a distinguished Australian and was 
a long serving permanent head of a number of government departments 
until his retirement last year from the position of Secretary of the 
Department of Defence.

  

 “Mr Ayers is eminently suited to undertake this 
important Inquiry and has extensive knowledge of the structures and 
operations of government”.
