  DECISIONS COMPLETED FOR 43 INDONESIAN ARRIVALS 

  The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has decided the final visa  application from the group of 43 Indonesians from Papua province who arrived in Australia  in January, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone,  announced today. 

  “Decisions on visa applications are made on their individual merits, in accordance with  international legal obligations and domestic law,” the Minister said. 

  “The last applicant has been refused a temporary visa. 

  “This individual has the right to seek merits review by the independent Refugee Review  Tribunal. 

  “The decision on this person was not made at the same time as the 42 other members of  the group as there were specific issues to be pursued. 

  “These related to the possibility that this person has the right to re-enter and live in another  country. 

  “These inquiries have now been concluded.” 

  The 42 other members of the group, who were located on the Cape York Peninsula on 18  January, were granted temporary protection visas in March 2006.
