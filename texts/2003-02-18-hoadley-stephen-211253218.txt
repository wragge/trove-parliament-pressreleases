 Abstract: This  paper  calls  attention  to  the  influence  of  politics  on  German  and  

 Australian  immigration  policies,  which  by  extension  include  refugee,  asylum,  and  

 settlement policies.  It traces the evolution of German immigration policies, recounts 

 the  debates  surrounding  the  SPD-Green  government  1998-2002,  and  with  reference  

 also  to  Australia,  draws  some  conclusions  about  politics  and  immigration  policies.  

 Germany’s  refugee  policies,  traditionally  among  the  most  liberal  in  Europe,  were  

 gradually  tightened  in  the  1990s  in  response  to  a  rising  foreigner  population,  social  

 tensions and political pressures. A vigorous debate in 1999-2000 led to a major study 

 by the SÃ¼ssmuth  Commission  and  then to  policy changes  introduced by in  the SPD-Green government’s Immigration Act. But questionable passage in the Bundesrat led 

 President Rau to delay his signature and the opposition parties to challenge the law in 

 the Constitutional Court.  CDU opposition leader Edmund Stoiber attempted to make 

 immigration  an  election  issue  by  threatening  to  annul  the  Act  if  his  party  won  the  

 2002 election.   He did not win, but the Act was annulled in December by an adverse 

 Constitutional  Court  ruling,  and  the  government  and  opposition  are  manoeuvring  to  

 adjust and resubmit it.  Australia too has been riven by controversy, particularly over 

 interception, deflection, and detention of asylum seekers.  The two countries are found 

 to  be  comparable  with  regard  to  the  tensions  between  immigration  specialists  and  

 advocates  on  the  one  hand  and  politicians  on  the  other.   Building  bridges  over  the  

 conceptual gap from both sides is the most promising endeavour.

 Introduction to Germany: Four Immigration Streams  

 

 German  immigration  policy  is  seldom  out  of  the  news  or  free  from  political  and  public  controversy  

 these  days.   This  has  not  always  been  the  case,  and  this  paper  begins  by  showing  why  immigration  

 became  a  major  issue  in  public  discourse  in  the  1990s  and  how in  the  period  1998-2002  the  German  

 political  leaders  debated  and  dealt  with  this  complex  issue.   The  focal  point  is  the  lead-up  to  the  

 September 2002 general election but it will be shown that the issue both preceded and succeeded that 

 event.   

 

 From  the  time  of  the  establishment  of  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  in  1949  its  leaders  have  

 welcomed  Germans  from  East  Germany  and  assisted  ethnic  Germans  living  (Aussiedler)  in  the  

 communist  countries  of  Central  Europe  and  the  Soviet  Union  to  return  to  the  homeland.1   This was 

 primarily  a  political  posture  reflecting  a  deep-rooted  pan-German  sentiment  and  at  the  same  time  an  

 expedient policy to undermine the legitimacy of the East German regime by attracting its population to 

 desert.   These  policies inadvertently brought  major  economic  benefits  to  West  Germany by providing 

 human capital and stimulating consumer and construction demand.  The East German leaders pursued a 

 similar  German-return  policy  and  in  addition  made  entry  easy  for  migrants  from  Third  World  states,  

 principally  those  of  communist  or  anti-Western  persuasion.   This  latter  too  was  a  political  posture,  

 adopted to complete ideologically with the West Zone.   

 

 In  subsequent  decades  the  German  economic  miracle  unfolded,  economic  growth  accelerated,  and  

 demand  for  labour  grew.   Both  German  governments  set  up  systems  to  attract  Gastarbeiter  or  guest  

 workers.   The  need  for  labour  was  patent  and  the  benefits  of  foreign  labour  obvious,  so  officials  

 enjoyed public acceptance of the policy for many years.  Those Germans who objected were few and 

 scattered; most Germans were either uninformed or unenthusiastic but politically acquiescent, regarding 

 it at worst as a necessary - but temporary - evil.  As the economy in the West evolved from primary and 

 secondary to tertiary emphases and demand for mass labour reached a plateau and then declined in the 

 1980s, the guest worker schemes were discontinued.  But foreigners already resident were allowed to  

 remain,  as  were  those  in  East  Germany  upon  reunification  in  1989.   Forced  repatriations  were  not  

 politically palatable, given the deep aversion to such policies practiced by the Nazi regime within living 

 memory.  And many had legitimate claims to tenure by virtue of EU citizenship, marriage to nationals, 

 children  born  in  country,  schooling,  and  employment.   This  transformed  a  temporary  economic  

 

 1  The  evolution  of  German  immigration  policies  is  sketched  in  Dietrich  ThrÃ¤nhardt,  “Germany’s  Immigration   Policies  and  Politics”  in  Grete  Brochmann  and  Tomas  Hammar,  eds.,  Mechanisms  of  Immigration  Control:  A   Comparative  Analysis  of  European  Regulation  Policies  (Oxford:  Berg,  1999),  Heather  Booth,  The  Migration   Process  in  Britain  and  West  Germany  (Aldershot:  Avebury,  Ashgate  Publishing,  1992),  and  Lydia  Morris,  Managing  Migration:  Civic  Stratification  and  Migrants’  Rights  (London:  Routledge,  2002,  especially  Ch  2  on   Germany.   Useful  observations  and  statistics  may be  found  in  Tito  Boeri  et  al  eds,   Immigration Policy and the  Welfare System (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002) and Ruud Koopmans and Paul Statham, eds, Challenging  Immigration and Ethnic Relations: Comparative European Perspectives (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000).

 development policy into  a massive  permanent settlement problem, as policy-makers grappled  with the 

 uncomfortable  fact  that  nearly  ten  percent  of  Germany’s  population  was  non-German-born  and  most  

 without German citizenship. 

 

 Adherence to the ideals of a unified Europe and to the obligations of the Schengen Agreement brought 

 a third category of foreigners to Germany: citizens of other EU states.  These were allowed to reside 

 and  work  in  Germany,  although  not  to  become  citizens  unless  naturalisation  requirements  were  

 fulfilled.   The  EU  citizens  were  mainly  workers  and  students  (who  also  worked  part  time)  and  were  

 estimated to comprise a quarter of the 7.3 million foreigners resident in 1996.2 

 In the 1990s a fourth stream of immigration surged from a trickle to a flood, that of refugees from the 

 countries of the former Yugoslavia, and then of Iraq and Afghanistan, driven out by tyranny and civil 

 war.  Germany, for decades rivalled only by France as a haven for the persecuted, now bore the brunt of 

 the  new wave  of  asylum-seekers.    The  wave  was  strengthened  by the  rise  of  the  number  of  refugees  

 world-wide  to  over  20  million  as  a  result  of  conflict,  drought,  and  other  “push”  factors  in  the  Third  

 World, particularly Africa and the Middle East, and the former Soviet Union,  and the urgent pleas of 

 the UNHCR for assistance, to which Germany proved receptive. 

 

 Rise of Controversy 

 These four streams converged in the 1990s with rising unemployment (over four million or 10 percent 

 of  the  labour  force),  welfare  costs,  and  crime  to  provoke  rising  anti-foreign  and  anti-immigrant  

 sentiment  in  sections  of  the  German  population.   Skin-heads  and  neo-Nazi  groups  appeared,  anti-Semitism  flared,  and  a  wave  of  abuse  and  fire-bomb  attacks  on  foreigners  shocked  German  leaders.   

 Political  parties  of  a  neo-rightist  and  anti-immigration  persuasion  such  as  the  Republicans  and  the  

 German  People’s  Union  appeared  in  the  1990  and  1998  election  respectively  and  the  National  

 Democratic  Party which  had  contested  elections  since  1965  adopted  a  more  explicit  anti-immigration  

 posture in the 1990s.  While these parties combined garnered less than 3 percent of the Bundestag vote 

 in 1998,3 their effect was magnified by the concern of moderate and idealistic German leaders to avoid 

 any  taint  of  prejudice  or  inhospitality  and  thus  to  address  the  intertwined  immigration,  refugee,  and  

 settlement issues bequeathed by their predecessors.  German leaders were also sincerely committed to 

 the ideals of human rights and freedom of movement within Europe and international norms of refugee 

 protection.   This  obliged  the  mainstream  political  parties  to  think  seriously  about  the  issues  and  to  

 address them in their policy platforms.

In January 1998 a new political party with an anti-Europe, anti-immigration platform, the Alliance of  Free Citizens-Offensive for Germany, was launched but made little electoral impact.

 Party Differences 

 However  this  did  not  produce  a  policy  consensus,  for  the  parties  diverged  on  fundamentals  from  the  

 start.   The  parties  of  the  centre-right  -  the  Christian  Democratic  Union  and  its  Bavarian  partner  the  

 Christian  Social  Union,  sometimes  called  the  Union  parties  -  tended  to  conceive  of  the  issue  as  an  

 immigration problem, that is, immigration was too permissive, to which the solution was a restriction of 

 immigration.   The  CSU  leaders  and  Bavarians  in  general  tended  to  be  particularly  nationalistic  and  

 unsympathetic to foreigners and immigration, whereas northern and urban Germans tended to be more 

 tolerant.   The  parties  of  the  centre-left  -  the  German  Social  Democratic  Party  and  its  partner  in  

 government  since  1998  the  Greens  (Bundniss  90-die  GrÃ¼nen)  tended  in  contrast  to  see  the  issue  as  a  

 settlement  problem,  to  which  the  solution  was  to  liberalise  the  citizenship  process  and  subsidise  

 German  language  schooling  and  settlement  programmes.    The  small  centrist  Free  Democratic  Party  

 adopted varying viewpoints depending on which major party it was oriented towards, that is, the SDP in 

 the 1980s and early 1990s, the CDU-CSU from the later 1990s to the present. 

 

 The 1998 Election 

 This picture, painted only in black and white, is useful as a backdrop to the political events of the late 

 1990s but is obviously shallow, and needs shades of grey to deepen it.  The next passage turns to the 

 period  1998,  when  the  SPD-Green  government  was  elected,  and  the  traces  the  issues  as  they  were  

 debated during the next four years in the run-up to the 2002 Bundestag election.  The first observation 

 is that immigration was already an issue in the 1998 election, second only to, but obviously linked with, 

 unemployment.  The CDU-CSU’s election manifesto presented a section entitled “Effective Stemming 

 of  Undesired  Immigration”  and  its  leader,  Chancellor  Helmut  Kohl,  stated  that  densely  populated  

 Germany  could  absorb  no  more  foreigners  and  Germany  could  not  reduce  poverty  by  taking  in  the  

 world’s  poor.   The  CSU  was  narrowly  deflected  from  injecting  the  phrase  “Germany  is  not  an  

 immigration  country”  into  the  manifesto,  but  that  phrase  continued  to  be  a  manta  for  the  centre-right  

 sceptics of immigration.  Turkish newspapers urged a vote against the “anti-foreigner” CDU-CSU but 

 at the same time 13 percent of polled Germans said they were sympathetic to the three right-wing anti-immigration parties.4  

 The SPD in contrast promised to liberalize immigration policy by means of transparent quotas and to 

 provide  for  dual  citizenship  and  birthright  citizenship,  that  is,  automatic  citizenship  for  children  of  

 foreigners  born  on  German  soil.   This  principle,  jus  soli,  stood  in  contrast  to  the  principle  of  jus 

 sanguinus that had underpinned Germany’s immigration laws since the time of the Second Reich.  The 

 Greens,  too,  advocated  birthright  citizenship  and  ridiculed  the  CDU-CSU  policies  by  claiming  that  

 Jesus would not be permitted to immigrate to Germany and if he appeared he would be deported. 

 

 4  Migration News, Vol 5, no 8 (August 1998), at http://migration.ucdavis.edu.  A FORSA poll in 1998 found 52  percent of respondents believed there were too many foreigners in Germany and 10 percent who would vote for an  extreme anti-immigration party.  Migration News, Vol 5 No 10 (October 1998), at http://migration.ucdavis.edu  In  the 1998 election, however, the combined vote for the extreme right barely exceeded 3 percent, with most of the  protest vote going, ironically, to the ex-Communist Party of Democratic Socialism. 

 6  HOADLEY, Steve  

 

 By  the  eve  of  the  election,  however,  the  two  major  parties  converged.   The  SPD  condemned  crime  

 among  foreigners  and  pledged  rapid  deportation  of those  convicted.   Its  leaders  also  pledged  to  limit  

 immigration,  making  its  stance  almost  indistinguishable  from  that  of  the  government.   On  the  CDU  

 side,  Chancellor  Kohl  proposed  to  reduce  the  naturalisation  waiting  period  from  fifteen  to  ten  years,  

 stealing  some  of  the  opposition’s  wind.   But  he  rejected  birthright  citizenship,  and  the  two  parties  

 continued to differ on this issue.   

 

 The  new  SPD-Green  coalition  government  in  October  1998  announced  its  intention  to  reform  the  

 naturalisation law, which dated back to 1913, to give children of foreigners born in Germany a right to 

 citizenship.   And  it  would  streamline  immigration  and  asylum  procedures.   In  the  first  authoritative  

 enunciation of this non-traditional and controversial notion, it declared that Germany was a country of 

 immigrants.  But new figures showed that Germany now had 7.5 million foreigners and also 4 million 

 ethnic Germans newly arrived from the former Soviet Union,  many unable to speak German well and 

 largely living on welfare.  This realisation,  plus strong resistance in the Bundestag by the centre-right 

 opposition  parties,  joined  by  the  ex-Communists  from  the  East  zone,  obliged  the  government  to  

 reconsider.   The  new  Interior  Minister  Otto  Schily,  subsequently  backed  by  the  new  Chancellor  

 Gerhard  SchrÃ¶der,  declared  that  Germany  had  reached  its  absorptive  capacity  and  that  future  

 immigration quotas should be set at zero.  Therefore a new immigration law as not an urgent priority, 

 and  the  emphasis  would  be  placed  on  naturalisation,  settlement  and  integration  of  existing  resident  

 foreigners.   Some  intra-coalition  strife  arose  when  the  Greens,  complaining  that  SchrÃ¶der  and  Schily  

 had broken the coalition agreement, made public their advocacy if an immigration quota of 200,000. 

 

 Demographic Trends and Policy Adjustments 

 But  the  issue  was  wider  than  a  party-political  squabble.   The  new  Foreigners  Commission  and  the  

 Council on Migration, backed by government statisticians, academic and think-tank demographers, and 

 employers associations, had begun to document and call attention to a looming demographic problem.  

 Emigration by Germans, and low birth rates and aging among those remaining, pointed to a long-term 

 fall in population and a consequent slow-down in demand, shortage of skilled workers, and decline of 

 economic activity generally.  According to one estimate made by Freiburg University Professor Dieter 

 Oberndorfer,  300,000  to  400,000  new  migrants  were  needed  every  year  to  maintain  Germany’s  

 economic  vitality  and  sustain  the  welfare  state.   But  the  demographers’  reasoned  arguments  did  not  

 convince  everyone,  for  at  the  same  time,  a  Die  Woche  newspaper  poll  found  75  percent  of  Germans  

 wanted immigration to be reduced, not increased.5  

 

 

 5  Migration  News,  Vol  5,  no.  4  (December  1988),  at  http://migration.ucdavis.edu   The  president  of  the  Federal   Statistics  Office  subsequently  cited  a  net  immigration  level  of  310,000  as  necessary  for  Germany  to  retain  its   current  population  level  of  82.2  million.   Migration  News,  Vol  7,  No  8  (August  2000),

 7  HOADLEY, Steve  

 In  January  1999  the  government  introduced  an  amendment  to  ease  naturalisation  and  permit  dual  

 citizenship.   Children  born  in  Germany  or  to  a  parent  who  had  arrived  legally  by  age  14  were  to  be  

 entitled  to  citizenship.   This  enshrined  jus  soli  for  the  first  time  and,  creditably  from  a  human  rights  

 point of view, virtually removed ethnic or national discrimination from the law (with the exception of 

 the ready acceptance of ethnic Germans from abroad, which was to terminate in 2010).  Residence time 

 for  other  applicants  was  reduced  from  15  to  8  years  (and  down  to  3  years  for  spouses  of  German  

 citizens of 2 years duration).  But those eligible were restricted to those who could pay an application 

 fee, pass a German language and a civics test, were not on welfare, did not have a prison record, and 

 pledge  to  support  the  German  constitution.   Dual  citizenship  was  permitted  for  Germans  from Russia  

 and a few other countries but in most cases the previous citizenship had to be surrendered at age 23…a 

 further retreat by the SPD from its election promise.  According to some estimates, these requirements 

 reduced those eligible in foreign population by half, to less than four million.  

 

 Even  with  these  restrictions,  the  proposed  law  was  decried  by  the  opposition  parties  for  dissolving  

 German  cultural  and  social  cohesion  and  legitimising  unemployment  and  ghettoisation.   The  CSU  

 launched a petition against it that gained five million signatures.   The CSU also threatened to challenge 

 the new law in the Constitutional Court.  Hesse state’s CDU leader took up the cry and, bolstered by the 

 anti-immigrant publicity, won the election,  reversing the normally liberal trend  in the state centred  on 

 Frankfurt.6   

 

 Opposition notwithstanding, the Bundestag passed the amendment in May 1999, whereupon it became 

 effective on 1 January 2000.   During the next three years nearly one million foreigners naturalised, but 

 this was less than a third of those eligible.  Half were allowed to retain dual citizenship because their 

 state of origin would not cancel their passports or charged prohibitive fees to do so, for example Iran 

 and Turkey respectively. 

 

 The Green Card Issue 

 The major issue of 2000 was the so-called “green card” proposal.  It was put forward by the BITKOM, 

 an  information  technology  peak  association,  who  claimed  there  were  75,000  openings  for  computer  

 programmers and engineers that would cripple the industry if not filled, and many German enterprises 

 would  have  to  move  abroad  to  find  qualified  staff.   BITKOM  suggested  that  the  government  offer  

 temporary residence to qualified persons in a scheme similar to that operated by the United States.  The 

 proposal  was  well  received  by  the  government  for  several  reasons.   First,  there  was  a  demonstrable  

 need.  Second, the persons admitted would be immediately employed in a key industry.  Third, it would 

 boost Germany’s leading edge technology establishment.  And fourth and fifth, from a political point of 

 view  the  new  policy  would  cast  the  government  as  a  champion  of  the  glamorous  information

 technology  industry  and  at  the  same  time  popularise  the  notion  of  immigration,  with  the  intake  of  

 white-collar  professionals  offsetting  the  stereotype  of  non-German-speaking  welfare  recipients  and  

 smugglers. 

 

 Nevertheless  the  proposed  policy  provoked  controversy  throughout  the  first  half  of  2000.   The  

 opposition  CDU-CSU  spoke  against  it  as  a  new guest  worker  scheme,  with  the  same  risks  as  the  old  

 one,  and  as  a  hasty  stop-gap  not  well  thought  out.   The  CDU  premier  candidate  of  North  Rhein-Westphalia earned  notoriety by coining the phrase “children instead  of Indians”, denoting his wish to  

 promote  training  of  young  Germans  rather  than  importing  trained  foreigners,  most  of  which  were  

 predicted  to  be  recruited  from India’s  burgeoning  IT  establishment.    They in  turn  were  criticised  by 

 employers  associations,  who  normally  supported  the  centre-right  parties,  for  their  failure  to  come  up  

 with an alternative that would ease the computer worker shortage.  Other industries took up the call for 

 green card  immigrants to  fill their specialist vacancies and  universities requested  that foreign students 

 not  be  required  to  return  to  their  countries  of  origin  upon  completion  of  studies.   But  again  political  

 obstacles loomed when polls found up to 65 percent of Germans were against the scheme.  

 

 Among  government  ministers  opinion  was  divided.   The  Minister  of  Education  and  Research  and  the  

 Minister  of  the  Economy  backed  the  green  card  scheme  enthusiastically.   Green  ministers  and  their  

 party supported  it,  although with some  idealistic  misgivings about  a  brain drain,  stripping third  world  

 countries  of  their  experts  for  Germany’s  economic  benefit.   The  Minister  of  Labour  cited  

 unemployment  and  took  a  stance  similar  to  the  “children  not  Indians”  notion,  but  more  nuanced  and  

 diplomatically  phrased.   The  Minister  of  Interior  Otto  Schily,  whose  job  it  was  to  implement  the  

 scheme, pledged to block a second generation of guest workers from settling in Germany.  The result 

 was  a  policy  compromise.   The  government  decided  in  May  2000  to  offer  green  cards  to  10,000  

 qualified  persons  (not  30,000  as  initially  requested  by  the  IT  industry)  for  a  three-year  work  period,  

 renewable for two more years, after which repatriation would be expected.  Simultaneously it awarded 

 training grants to the IT industry for training of indigenous computer specialists, expecting that demand 

 would be met from domestic sources by the end of the five year green card period.  By mid-2000 the 

 green card programme was up and running, and generally accepted. 

 

 SPD Reconsideration of Immigration Policy 

 But the green card episode had an unexpected consequence.  It provoked a serious reconsideration by 

 German  leaders  of  all  aspects  of  immigration,  asylum,  and  settlement  policies,  a  reconsideration  the  

 government  had  hoped  to  avoid  by  responding  piecemeal  to  specific  problems  within  the  existing  

 framework.   In  May  2000  the  opposition  FPD  introduced  to  the  Bundestag  for  the  third  time  a  draft  

 comprehensive  immigration  law.   They  and  other  opposition  parties  pointed  out  that  of  300,000  

 newcomers  each  year,  one  third  were  ethnic  Germans,  one-third  were  asylum-seekers,  and  one-third  

 were  family  reunion  migrants.   None  was  necessarily  good  for  Germany’s  high-tech  economy.   A  

 9  HOADLEY, Steve  

 comprehensive  law  should  take  into  account  Germany’s  needs,  not  just  the  needs  of  the  immigrants.   

 The conservatives’ particular target was the asylum policy, which they found too liberal.  Over 95,000 

 persons  applied  for  asylum  in  1999.   Reducing  the  length  of  time  to  process  applications  and  the  

 number  of  acceptances,  and  deterring  new applicants  by adopting  strict  requirements,  would  in  effect  

 free  up  spaces  for  economically  qualified  immigrants.   This  notion  assumed  a  reapportioning  of  

 numbers  accepted  in  different  categories  under  an  intake  ceiling  somewhere  between  300,000  and  

 500,000,  in  other  words  a  de  facto  quota  system  that  would  shift  the  balance  to  favour  economically  

 useful migrants.  All parties agreed that the fundamental right to asylum guaranteed in the Basic Law 

 would  be  respected,  but  they  disagreed  on  how to  interpret  and  administer  that  right  in  balance  with  

 other needs and obligations. 

 

 At  the  time,  Minister  of  Labor  Otto  Schily  rejected  opposition  proposals  out  of  hand,  saying  if  there  

 were a new law, its quotas would be zero.  But lobbying by industry leaders, worsening economic and 

 demographic trends, and criticism by the Greens and liberal opinion leaders and NGOs persuaded the 

 government  to  reconsider.   In  June  Schily unexpected  reversed  himself,  acknowledged  the  value  of  a  

 comprehensive law, and appointed a high-level commission chaired by the former CDU speaker of the 

 Bundestag  Rita  SÃ¼ssmuth,  to  conduct  studies,  receive  submission,  and  make  recommendations.   This  

 took the pressure off the government, but the debate continued sporadically for the next year, until July 

 2001 when the Commission issued its final report.7 

 

 The  recommendations  of  the  SÃ¼ssmuth  Commission  were  less  than  “historic”  as  eulogised  by  Schily  

 inasmuch  as  they  mainly  reviewed  and  reiterated  policies  initiated  piecemeal  during  the  prior  several  

 years.  For example, they acknowledged Germany’s need to admit a growing number of economically 

 qualified immigrants, reaffirmed the green card programme, and proposed renewed funding of facilities 

 to  help  new immigrants  to  learn  German  and  settle  more  quickly.   They retained  the  traditional  open  

 door  for  family  reunion,  refugee  and  asylum-seeker  entry  but  sensibly  urged  streamlining  of  their  

 administrative procedures.  The Commission’s major innovation lay in proposing a series of six “doors” 

 for  labour  market  immigrants,  catering  for  skilled  persons,  apprentices,  students,  and  entrepreneurs,  

 with individuals to be selected by a points system.   A quota of 50,000 persons a year was suggested. 

 

 Draft Immigration Law 

 In  September  Schily presented  a  draft  immigration  law to  Cabinet.    This  was  to  be  Germany’s  first-ever comprehensive immigration law, consolidating the ad hoc policies and amendments dating back to 

 the  1913  law  when  Germany  was  an  expanding  mini-empire,  and  establishing  Germany  as  an  

 immigration  country  for  the  first  time.   It  was  contested  by  the  parties  of  the  pragmatic  right  for  

 opening  the  human  floodgates  to  inundate  four  million  unemployed  Germans,  and  by  those  of  the  

 idealist left as too restrictive and economically self-interested.  Compromise was necessary because the

 SDP did not have majorities in either the Bundestag or the Bundsrat, but depended on the votes of the 

 Greens  in  the  former  and  some  opposition  party-affiliated  Land  deputies  in  the  latter  to  secure  

 legislative passage.  Inter-party negotiations took place in late 2001 and early 2002 to fashion a law that 

 would  garner  the  necessary  votes.   The  SPD  compromised  initially  with  the  Greens  by  widening  the  

 grounds  for  asylum  to  include  non-state  and  gender-based  persecution  and  allowing  children  to  join  

 their parents resident in German up to age 14 (having initially proposed 8 then 12 years of age).  But 

 the Greens were obliged to accept in return a tightening of asylum eligibility determination procedures 

 and  acceleration  of  deportation  proceedings  for  failed  applicants,  and  support  the  overall  economic  

 thrust of the new law.   

 

 On  the  other  hand,  CDU  opponents  rejected  the  non-state  and  gender  persecution  provisions  for  

 asylum, demanded coercive detention of failed asylum-seekers who refused to leave and restrictions on 

 welfare  and  work  available  to  refugees,  wanted  a  further  lowering  of  the  age  limit  by which  children  

 had to join immigrant parents or lose their claim to immigration, demanded that skilled migrants have a 

 guaranteed job as a prerequisite for entry regardless of their points score, called for a ceiling on overall 

 entries,  demanded  that  the  federal  government  subsidise  the  states  to  provide  the  required  new  

 language,  settlement  and  integration  programmes,  and  wanted  the  law  renamed  the  “immigration  

 reduction law”.8   

 

 Interwoven  with  the  behind-the-scenes  inter-party  negotiations  on  these  issues  were  the  electoral  

 strategies of each party, with the September 2002 Bundestag election already in view.  The Greens were 

 eager  to  portray themselves  to  their  potential  voters  as  still  able  to  secure  idealistic  concessions  from 

 the  SDP.   The  conservative  opposition  parties  were  too,  but  were  curiously  ambivalent.   They  had  

 foreshadowed their strategy of making immigration a major election issue, so  concessions now by the 

 government  might  steal  their  election  campaign  thunder  later.   Consequently  they  did  not  press  their  

 case  a  vigorously  as  they  might  have.   Schily  played  skilfully  on  this  ambivalence  by  courteously  

 displaying  a  willingness  to  discuss,  but  never  explicitly  conceding  the  validity  of,  the  opposition’s 

 demands.   Nevertheless  he  did  modify  the  bill  twice,  and  in  his  explanatory  summary  stated  the  law  

 would be an instrument for “demand-oriented management and limitation [my italics] of immigration”, 

 and  stressed  that  deportees  would  be  confined  to  “facilities”  (Ausreisezentrum)  until  they  departed.9  

 Paragraph  1  of  the  law  specifies  its  aim  is  “to control  and  restrict  [my  italics]  the  immigration  of  

 foreigners  into  Germany”.   Meanwhile  as  time  passed  and  the  legislative  decision  loomed,  public  

 opinion,  shaped  by business  associations,  unions,  churches,  and  migration  and  refugee  support  NGOs  

 

 8  The opposition made varying numbers and combinations of demands, but the core four were: 1) reducing the age  at which children had to join their immigrant parents or lose their right to residency, 2) making labour-migration  rules more restrictive, 3) dropping the widened criteria for asylum advocated by the Greens, and 4) changing the  emphasis of the law to restricting rather than encouraging immigration.

 such  as  Caritas,  warmed  increasingly  to  the  proposed  law.10    This  further  blunted  the  opposition’s  

 challenge. 

 

 Contested Passage 

 On 1 March 2002 the Bundestag passed the Immigration Law by a comfortable margin of 320 to 225, 

 vindicating the government’s initiative.  The vote in the Bundesrat on 22 March was much closer, 35-34.  The winning two votes were cast by the state of Brandenburg.   But that state was governed by a 

 red-blue  coalition  of  SPD  and  CDU  party  members,  and  the  state’s  two-person  delegation  to  the  

 Bundesrat  was  similarly  composed.   When  the  state’s  name  was  called  out  in  the  chamber,  the  SDP  

 delegate called out “yes” and the CDU delegate called out “no”.  Because Article 51 of the Basic Law 

 requires states to cast a unanimous vote, the speaker requested the governor of Brandenburg Manfred 

 Stolpe to clarify his state’s vote.  The governor, a SPD member, replied “yes”.  The CDU members of 

 his delegation objected and persuaded other CDU leaders to walk out in protest. 

 

 The law was then laid before President Johannes Rau for signature.  The CDU urged him not to sign on 

 grounds of its questionable passage in the Bundesrat and threatened to take the issue over his head to 

 the  Constitutional  Court  if  he  did.   Some  of  its  members  hinted  that  if  he  did  sign,  he  would  be  

 displaying partisanship (he was formerly a politician affiliated with the SPD).  The government urged 

 him to sign so the law could come into effect at the beginning of 2003 for Germany’s economic benefit, 

 and hinted it was the obligation of a president to comply with the policy of the elected government of 

 the  day.   President  Rau  rejected  the  importuning  of  both  parties  and  retorted  publicly  with  almost  

 unprecedented bluntness: “I  do not expect the office of the German president to be drawn into party-political wrangling, as people have attempted to do in recent weeks”.11   Rau’s role appeared to be two-fold,  to  decide  whether  the  content  of  the  law was  constitutional,  and  whether  the  law’s  passage  was  

 legitimate.   On  20  June  he  signed  the  law  on  the  grounds  that  its  content  was  constitutional.   But  he  

 indicated  that  he  did  not  have  a  presidential  opinion  on  its  method  of  passage  and  would  welcome  a  

 Constitutional  Court  ruling  on  that  issue.   The  CDU  state  leaders  then  requested  the  Constitutional  

 Court to annul the law because of improper passage.  In December 2002 the Court agreed, preventing 

 the Law from coming into effect as scheduled. 

 

 Meanwhile  the  SPD-Green  coalition  government  was  narrowly  re-elected  in  September  2002.   Its  re-election against all predictions was attributed not to its immigration or economic policies but rather to 

 Chancellor Schroeder’s vigorous leadership  in response to  the disastrous floods of Western European 

 rivers  prior  to  the  election,  and  to  Schroeder’s  forthright  resistance  to  US  President  George  Bush’s  

 

 10  In March 2002 a poll for ARD television found 51 percent of Germans in favour of the law and only 30 percent  against.   Just  two  years  previously  the  proportions  favouring  a  quota  immigration  system  were  the  reverse.    Migration News, Vol 9, No 4 (April 2002), at http://migration.ucdavis.edu    11

 belligerence towards Iraq, which struck a receptive chord among German voters.  Despite its generally 

 favourable  view  of  the  now-annulled  Immigration  Law  the  public  remained  as  ambivalent  about  

 immigration  and  foreigners  as  ever.   A poll  in  November  2002  found  that  52  percent  of men  and  58  

 percent of women agreed that Germany had too many foreigners.12 

 

 Prognosis 

 Interior Minister Schily in December announced he would reintroduce the Immigration Law in January 

 2003.  The opposition parties immediately countered that they would demand concessions.  Their threat 

 carried weight, for state elections had by then given the CDU, CSU, and Free Democratic Party (FPD) 

 coalition  a  clear  majority  in  the  Bundesrat,  allowing  them  to  block  legislation.   In  February  the  SDP  

 heavily  lost  two  state  elections,  and  its  general  popularity  continued  to  decline.   Its  ability  to  push  

 through legislation weakened correspondingly.   

 A CDU spokeman stipulated “four clear conditions” for passage of the immigration law: 

 1. strict limits on the numbers of immigrants; 

 2. limitations on access to the social security system by new immigrants and asylum applicants; 

 3. guarantees of qualifications and jobs before economic immigrants are admitted; and 

 4.  measures  to  facilitate,  subsidise  and  ensure  the  integration  of  foreigners  already  resident  in  

 Germany.13 

 

 It is probably that the SPD will be obliged to make adjustments to its draft law to take these conditions 

 into  account,  if  it  is  serious  about  passing  it.   But  no  fundamental  changes  will  be  made,  for  the  

 opposition parties and the public have accepted that the new law is far from radical, their disagreements 

 with  it  are  marginal,  and  indeed  much  of  serves  Germany’s  economic  interests.   The  main  question  

 besides  what  changes  will  be  made  is  whether  it  will  be  passed  this  year  or  delayed  by  partisan  

 wrangling until a CDU-led coalition returns to power. 

 

 A Brief Comparison with Australia 

 Australians  may  recognise  a  number  of  the  migration  issues  and  policies  sketched  above,  and  realise  

 that their country is not generically different from Germany in these regards.  True, a century and a half 

 ago Australia was an isolated continent of immigration and relatively peaceful settlement (save for the 

 displacement  of  the  Aborigines)  when  Germany  was  collection  of  varied  states  struggling  for  

 amalgamation and military security in a hostile Europe.  In 1848 while Australia was importing people, 

 German  states  after  the  conservative  reaction  were  exporting  them,  mainly  to  America  but  some  to  

 Australia.   Germany’s  Prussian,  imperial,  Nazi,  and  communist  experiences  obviously  differ  from

 Australia’s  more  peaceful  constitutional  evolution  and  more  gradual  emergence  into  the  international  

 arena, chaperoned by Great Britain. 

 

 Nevertheless,  after  1949  one  finds  convergence,  and  more  so  in  the  1990s.   Their  immigration  

 principles  and  policies  now  appear  more  similar  than  different.   Each  government  has  accepted  the  

 international  humanitarian  obligations  imposed  by  the  UDHR,  the  ICCPR,  and  the  Refugee  

 Convention.   Each  has  variegated  policies  accommodating  refugees,  asylum  seekers,  hardship  cases,  

 and families in addition to “normal” immigrants, and settlement programmes to integrate those who are 

 accepted.  Each country needs immigrants to offset emigration and declining birth rates and to acquire 

 specialist skills and capital for economic growth.  

 

 More  significantly  in  light  of  recent  controversy  in  Australia,  each  has  policies  to  discourage  illegal  

 migrants,  to  apprehend,  detain,  and  interrogate  those  who  arrive,  and  to  deport  those  who  are  found  

 unacceptable,  but  only  after  a  legal  procedure,  during  which  detention  may  be  imposed.   Each  has  

 entered  into  international  negotiations  and  collaborations  to  combat  people  smuggling  and  people  

 trafficking,  and  to  persuade  by  diplomacy  and  cash  subsidies  governments  abroad  to  hold  or  take  

 would-be  illegal  entrants.   Germany’s  “Polish  Solution”  might  be  compared  with  Australia’s  “Pacific  

 Solution”.   

 

 It  might  be  argued  that  Germany  is  like  Australia  also  in  the  growing  politicisation  of  immigration  

 policy  in  the  1990s.   This  paper  has  made  clear  the  interweaving  of  party  and  electoral  politics  with  

 German immigration policy-making in recent years.  The same could be said of Australia, particularly 

 if  one  focuses  on  the  political  controversies  surrounding  asylum-seeker  detention,  interception,  and  

 deflection,  epitomised  by  the  Tampa  episode  and  the  Pacific  Solution.   These  issues  have  been  

 considered  at  length  elsewhere.14   This  paper  will  conclude  by  posing  a  contrast  between  experts,  

 practitioners,  and  advocates  on  the  one  hand,  and  political  parties  and  government  coalitions  on  the  

 other, that characterises both Germany and Australia.

 Specialists vs Politicians? 

 Let us begin with the oft-heard claim that politicians are the problem, clumsily intruding and distorting 

 policy,  and  that  experts  and  implementers  should  be  left  alone  to  get  on  with  the  job,  rallied  and  

 overseen  by  advocates.   Consider  the  following  assertions  and  apply  them  to  both  Germany  and  

 Australia.   Demographers  have  calculated  an  optimum  immigration  rate  to  sustain  the  population  of  

 Germany or raise the population of Australia.  Industrialists have specified the types of skilled people 

 they  need  to  fill  vacancies.   International  treaties  and  humanitarian  and  national  commitments  have  

 imposed obligations regarding refugees, asylum-seekers, family reunion and citizenship applicants, and 

 hardship cases (and returning ethnic Germans and citizens of Schengen-land).  Laws and administrative 

 practises have induced orderly induction.  Social agencies, local bodies, and charities facilitate effective 

 settlement.  NGO advocates keep watch to ensure fulfilment of human rights and humanitarian criteria.   

 

 In stark contrast, in this view, the public in both Germany and Australia display ignorance, prejudice, 

 and meanness.  The political parties compromise with each other while in government and pander to the 

 demagogues  and  the  media  at  election  time.   Immigration  policies  were  politicised  during  the  

 Australian  election  of  2001  and  would  have  been  during  the  German  election  of  2002  had  not  other  

 issues overshadowed them.  Sensible adjustments, such as the passage of the German Immigration Act 

 and the easing of Australian interception and detention policies, are blocked by political posturing.   

 

 Conclusion 

 To underscore the theme of this paper, the above passages have exaggerated the virtues of specialists, 

 administrators  and  advocates,  which  can  often  be  grounded  unsteadily  on  wishful  thinking,  and  

 denigrated  the  contribution  of  politicians,  which  is  the  devising  and  legitimising  of  workable  policy  

 from  the  raw  material  of  conflicting  demands  and  scarce  resources.    Nevertheless  the  contrast  is  a  

 useful  framework  onto  which  to  cast  the  immigration  policies  of  Germany  and  Australia  in  order  to  

 make  the  point  that  they  are  comparable  in  many  respects.    I  would  argue  that  most  democratic  

 countries  could  be  cast  onto  this  framework,  if  sensibly  adapted,  and  that  performing  this  exercise  

 would  further  illuminate  the  theme  of  this  paper:  immigration  policies  are  inextricably  linked  to  

 immigration politics.   

 

 This leads to a cautionary statement: an ideal immigration policy abstracted from processes of politics 

 and governance is a chimera.  The reformer should not try to eliminate politics from policy-making, for 

 to do so is to undermine democracy.  Nor should the policy-maker dismiss specialists and advocates as 

 dreamers,  thereby  denying  their  vision  and  hampering  adaptation  to  change.   Better  to  advocate  and  

 facilitate dialogue between politicians and specialists so as to educate both about the exigencies of the 

 other, thereby producing policy that is legitimate and sustainable as well as humane.  I urge specialists 

 and advocates at this Conference to keep in mind the political context and practical policy implications 

 of their analyses, and I urge politicians to listen and reflect on what is desirable as well as expedient.  If 

 15  HOADLEY, Steve  

 we all attempt to build conceptual and informational bridges between vision, advocacy and analysis on 

 the  one  hand  and  legitimation,  legislation,  funding,  administration  and  enforcement  on  the  other,  we  

 will be raising the prospects for both relevant scholarship and enlightened policy.
