 TIS HELPS ON HEALTH INSURANCE

 28/8/81

 The Mirister for Social Security,  Senator Fred Chaney and 

 the Minister for Immigration,  Mr Ian Macphee today announced that 

 the Telephone Interpreter Service of the Immigration Department 

 would be able to help migrants· and refugees who had questions 

 about the new health insurance arrangements.

 A special national hotline telephone service is available 

 to people who want advice on health insurance.

 :  Senator Chaney and Mr Macphee said: "We appreciate that

 while the special hotline service will be of tremendous value 

 'generally to the community,  there are still many people with 

 language problems and who will not be able to take advantage of 

 the hotline service".

 "To assist these people,  arrangements have been made to have 

 i  copies of the health insurance pamphlet produced in 8 different I  â  

 languages which set out the changes to the insurance system in 

 some detail. Copies of the pamphlets have been sent to the 

 Telephone Interpreter Service Centres".

 "Migrants and refugees who cannot easily make use of the 

 1  hotline will be able to ring the TIS Centres for guidance on the 

 'health insurance changes".

 I  The Ministers said that special briefing sessions had been

 j  provided to TIS staff to assist them in handling questions from 

 migrants and refugees.

 .  Under the new health insurance arrangements,  which operate

 .  from 1 September 1981, about three million people will be eligible 

 for special Federal Government assistance.

 They include pensioners who have a Health Benefits Card 

 and all migrants and refugees during their first six months in 

 Australia. Low income families can also obtain assistance,  but 

 they must first check their eligibility with the Social Security 

 Department. ' · '  .  .

 The new insurance arrangements are designed to encourage 

 people to take out their own health insurance cover.  The cost 

 of basic health insurance will attract a 32 cents in the dollar 

 tax rebate at the end of each financial year.
