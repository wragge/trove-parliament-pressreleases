  RACIAL VILIFICATION: COALITION'S EXPOSURE DRAFt 

  The Coalition today released as an exposure draft a Bill to prohibit racially based  threats and incit~.ment to threats of physical harm to property or person. 

  The Federal Liberal and National parties are totally opposed to racism in any form.  Our record over many years shows our strong pommitment to eliminating raeism,  wherever it occurs. · 

  It was a Coalition·Government that in the 1960's abolished the abhorrent White  Australia Policy. That decision led to a welcome inflow of many people from a wide  range of ethnic and racial backgrounds. We established the Institute of Multicultural  Affairs, SSS TV and introduced a wide range of multicultural settlement services that  remain the basis of Australia's multicultural policies today. It was also a Coalition  that welcomed to Australia the first boat people from South East Asia in the late 

  1970's and early 1980's, over the strident opposition of the Labor Party. · 

  We believe our exposure draft represents a much better response to community  concern over racial vilification than the Government's Bill. There are three essential  differences between the Government's Bill and our exposure draft:. 

  â¢ the criminal sanction in our exposure draft is much stronger than those in the  .Government's Bill. We believe that the Government penalties are too Jow. The  . stronger penalties in our Bill reflect the fact that racially motivated threats of ·  violence against person or property have no place in Australia and will not be 

  tolerated. 

  â¢ Our exposure draft does not impinge on the right to free speech, while still  making the same statement as the Government's Bill. Our bill is constitutional,  whereas the Government's Bill is of questionable constitutional status. Sir  Maurice Byers QC has indicated that the Government's Bill runs the risk of  being unconstitutional because it is an unnecessarily restrictive limitation on  free speech. Our draft doe~ not contain a criminal sanction for expressing views  that "incite to· racial hatred11â¢ However odious anyone's view is, they should. not  go to gaol for merely expressing it. Our exposure draft deals with tho~~TH

  ... 

  behaviour moves beyond expressing an opinion and into threatening physical  harm to person or property or inciting others to do so~ 

  â¢ Our exposure draft does not contain civil remedies. The Government's civil  remedy attaches to behaviour which merely Insults or offends. The potential  impact on citizens is breathtaking. 

  We must attack the underlying cause of racism, and we will do this thr.ough our  commitment to a $1 O million multipronged education package. Our consultations  have indicated that many Ethnic groups believe this is the best way to eliminate  racism. This must tie contrasted with the Government's lack of action to tackle the  causes of racial hatred and ignorance. 

  We believe our exposure draft makes a strong statement by the Commonwealth  opposing racial violence without limiting free speech. ·
