  Creation of a Frightened Nation  A/Prof Leonora Ritter  School of Social Sciences and Liberal Studies,  CSU, Bathurst, NSW.   

  Abstract: The paper examines how John Howard used the events that occurred  between August 28 and November 10 in 2001 to turn d efeat into victory.  It draws on  the theoretical model of power identified in the Ka rpman Drama Triangle and the  manipulation of power through the rescuer role to s how how, by creating a frightened 

  nation of victims, John Howard ensured his retentio n of the Prime Ministership  through establishing long-term dependence on him to  rescue Australians from those  he designates as ‘persecutors’    

  In August 2001 Howard was ‘fighting for his politic al life’ (Hewett, 2001, 25).  On   22 August a Morgan poll showed the ALP leading the Coalition (2 party preferred) by  55.5% to 44.5% and the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH)  (4) predicted a ‘Labor  landslide win’.   Yet, on 10 November 2001 when the election was held, the Coalition  won 81 of the 150 seats in the House of Representat ives, ‘a clear majority of  electorates’ (Vromen & Gelber, 2005, 191).  This tu rn around has been attributed to 

  the Tampa  incident along with the September 11 Terrorist att ack on the Twin Towers  in New York (Vromen & Gelber, 2005, 165).  This paper seeks to explain how the  Howard Government exploited these and other catastrophes to ensure an electoral  victory and set up a construct of power that has ma intained and enhanced Howard’s  long-term domestic popularity.   

  The theoretical model that underpins this paper is the Karpman Drama Triangle  (Cornelius and Faire, 1989, pp 71-75).  This model comes from the work and  observations of Stephen B. Karpman.  Using transactional analysis, it looks at the  potential for manipulating power of the three inter dependent roles of ‘persecutor’,  ‘rescuer’ and ‘victim’.  In this model, ‘persecutor s’ gain power by dominating or  bullying others;  ‘victims’ gain power by enlisting  the help of ‘rescuers’ to fend off  ‘persecutors’ and by manipulating ‘rescuers’ throug h dependence and an appearance  of helplessness;  ‘rescuers’ are empowered against ‘persecutors’ by creating alliances  with ‘victims’, while at the same time they gain po wer over the ‘victims’ by  becoming indispensable to them and knowing what ‘victims’ need better than the  ‘victims’ themselves do.     

  This paper’s hypothesis is that John Howard has empowered himself as Prime  Minister by taking on the ‘rescuer’ role, casting t he people of Australia as ‘victims’  who need his protection, and has maintained this re lationship by providing them with  an array of designated ‘persecutors’.     

  The advantage of playing the rescuer in the power t riangle is that it can take the moral  high ground, as opposed to ‘wicked’ persecutors and  ‘weak’ victims.  A Prime  Minister positioning himself in this way seems just ified in terms of social contract  theory, according to which: ‘the state has an oblig ation to protect and preserve the  security of its citizens’ (Spence, 2005, 17).  He c an also take a superior position as  evoking the ‘rescuer’ role compensates for the weak ness in elite theory ‘that elite  theorists cannot easily justify their specification  of what is in the interests of the  powerless’ (Dunleavy & O’Leary, 1987, 14).  John Howard’s ‘trust me’ is part of 

   2 

  siting himself as the ‘rescuer’, promising to save us from the bogey men he has  created.  It is characteristic of the ‘rescuer’ tha t he knows what is ‘best’ for the victim  and that this is usually something which the rescue r can either provide or facilitate.   Thus John Howard frequently tells Australians what they want, for example, he 

  recently assured us that we want ‘lower taxes, not a reform of the taxation system’, as  he claimed that his job is ‘to govern in the intere sts of the country’ even when that  involved ‘doing things that in the short term are u npopular, or make people nervous’  (Metherell, 2005, 9).   

  In order to sustain the power of the rescuer, demor alised ‘victims’ and demonised  ‘persecutors’ are required.  Fear is the essential element in demoralising ‘victims’ and  maintaining their dependence.  Helplessness is its adjunct.  When people are afraid  and helpless they welcome rescue and give themselves into the hands of the ‘rescuer’.   Thus ‘rescuers’ maintain their power by keeping the ir ‘victims’ afraid of something  that they can rescue them from.  Helplessness is en hanced by demonising  ‘persecutors’ so that an irrational element in the fear of the ‘victims’ makes them feel  that they cannot rescue themselves; thus they becom e dependent on the ‘rescuer’.   

  In 2001, just when John Howard was about to lose an election, the Tampa  crisis  created a perfect scenario for him to turn the Aust ralian people into ‘victims’ and  thereby take on the role of Australia’s ‘rescuer’.  The crisis was created by the  Government’s reaction to the Norwegian ship, Tampa , after it rescued over 400  asylum seekers, mostly from Afghanistan, from a lea ky boat in international waters.     

  Initially, the asylum seekers might appear to be ‘v ictims’.  Many were sick.  They  seemed desperate.  When the Captain of the Tampa  suggested returning them to  Indonesia from whence they came, they protested, and some threatened suicide.  The  Captain quickly became convinced that it was too ri sky to take them the 400  kilometres to the nearest Indonesian port. As the Tampa  was only 120 kilometres  from Christmas Island he headed there, thereby ente ring Australian territorial waters.  Four miles off Christmas Island he was ordered to s top.   

  In taking this action, the Howard government re-scr ipted the asylum seekers from  ‘victims’ (of persecution, people smugglers and the  hostile ocean) to ‘persecutors’, a  threat to the Australian people, who were thus move d from being cast as potential  ‘rescuers’ to taking the position of potential ‘vic tims’.   

  

  Howard was sowing his seeds of fear in fertile grou nd.  Even before Tampa , the  Australian view of asylum seekers was described ‘as  little better than vermin’  (Summers, 2001, 12).  Instead of counteracting this  view, Howard built it up.  In a  prescient column on 25 August, Hugh McKay (2001, 34) pointed out, in language that  mirrored a populist construct of election winners a s ‘rescuers’ and refugees as  ‘persecutors’, that:  

  …the vacuum created by the lack of social vision su cks in a flood of vicious  prejudice to fill the space  ...   Refugees have suddenly become illegal immigrants…Xenophobia …  [has] the power to unleash virulent prejudice and d raw votes to whoever [sic]  promises the more draconian crackdowns    It could happen.  It would be disgraceful and disa ppointing if it did …  The prejudices are already there; they only have to  be nurtured and â bingo â 

   3 

  you can forget education and health, you can forget  income tax cuts and GST  rollback, you can forget any serious calling to acc ount of this Government.   The election would then be about protecting [rescui ng] our shores from  hundreds of undesirable refugees [persecutors]   

  Recognising this potential, Howard tried to make fe ar of asylum seekers an election  issue before Tampa .  On 17 August he had called for a tighter law on asylum seekers  and ‘declared war on illegal immigrants’ (Clenell &  Grattan, 2001, 4).  He was also  already constructing himself as the sort of person who would make a good rescuer,  describing himself as someone who had ‘acquired an even greater capacity to handle  pressure, to see things in a broader perspective an d not be sort of mugged by the  fashion of the day’, and someone who had ‘strength’  (SMH 18-19 August 2001 , 33).   

  On 28 August, when the Tampa  story hit the headlines, the SMH did initially depict  the boat people as ‘victims’: ‘Three nations cast r efugees adrift’.  The Government’s  rhetoric quickly changed that perception, however, and re-cast the asylum seekers as  ‘persecutors’ with Australians as their potential ‘ victims’:  

  We simply cannot allow a situation to develop where Australia is seen around  the world as a country of easy destination … irresp ective of the legal status of  the people who would seek to come to Australia’ ( SMH 28 August 2001, 1).  By the second edition on 29 August, the SMH  headline emphasised the way of  thinking that resited the boat people as ‘persecuto rs’: ‘They’re intimidating us: PM’.     

  Acceptance of Howard’s depiction of Australians as the ‘victims’ depended on  fostering a belief that the country was about to be  overrun with asylum seekers. Thus  Howard used alarmist language to harness the persec ution complex of the Australian  people: ‘If the view becomes entrenched  [emphasis  added] around the world that it  is easy to get into this country, we will have an enormous  [emphasis  added]  problem.  We will have an unbelievable  [emphasis  added] problem in trying to  control our borders’ ( SMH  29 August 2001, 1); ‘It is in Australia’s national  interest  that we draw a line on what is increasingly  [emphasis  added] becoming an  uncontrollable  [emphasis  added] number of illegal arrivals’ ( SMH , 1-2 September  2001, p.1).     

  The Howard position was backed by his Ministers.  Upping the fear ante , Minister for  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddo ck, told Parliament that there  were 900 people waiting in Indonesia and ‘If these people were to enter Australia  now, it would be seen as the sign for all of them t o continue coming in the way in  which they are’ ( SMH 31 August 1).  This scenario, incidentally, facilit ated adding  Indonesia to the ranks of the ‘persecutors’, as it was blamed ‘for not preventing the  exodus’ ( SMH  5 September, 1).  By the third of September, when a 5.4 nautical mile  air exclusion zone was placed around the Tampa , the Treasurer, while refusing to put  a figure on what the Tampa  crisis cost, defended the expense of the military operation  (allegedly more than the cost of detaining all the boat people for over a year ( SMH 3  September 2001, 1)) as worth any price because it i nvolved ‘defending Australia’s  territorial integrity’ ( SMH  6 September 2001, 7) and was ‘a deterrent’ that wo uld  ‘save the country in the long run.’   

  The discourse increasingly assumed the language of war, subtly confirming the  construct of asylum seekers as ‘the enemy’.  The 30  August SMH headline reassured 

   4 

  Australians: ‘Troops told: whatever it takes’.  How ard personally assured the  Australian public ‘we are looking at ways of ensuri ng it [the Tampa ] does  go back into  international waters.  We are not prepared to let t he ship come to Australia… we are  quite determined’ ( SMH  30 August 2001, 1).  When another boat load of des perate  people was turned away on 9 September, it was reported that: ‘A Navy warship  repelled the craft, with an estimated 120 aboard’ ( Metherall & Tingle, 2001, 22).     

  In addition to generic casting of asylum seekers as  ‘persecutors’, Howard offered  specific reasons for seeing the Captain of the Tampa  and his asylum seeking  passengers as ‘persecutors’; he accused the Tampa  captain of ‘lying’ about the  medical condition of the refugees ( SMH  30 August 2001, 1) and suggested that some  of the boat people were faking sickness.  He moved into the language of persecution  by accusing the asylum seekers of ‘trying to intimi date us with our own decency’  (SMH  29 August 2001, 1).     

  The demonising of the Tampa  asylum seekers was facilitated by ensuring that th e  public did not get any close-up images of them.  Ho ward ordered the port of  Christmas Island to be closed and the SAS troops, w ho had stormed the Tampa  after it  tried to dock at Christmas Island, kept the media w ell away from the ship. No  Australian lawyer or aid worker was allowed to spea k to the asylum seekers. Stories  of individuals on board were suppressed. The exclus ion zone prevented any  photographs. Thus there was no danger of the Australian people visualising the  Tampa  rescuees as desperate human beings in need of symp athy and support;  ‘Australians could regard  them not as people, but as part of the anonymous,  frightening Muslim horde’ (Horin, 2001, 37).     

  Containment of the asylum seekers also facilitated a continuing inference that the  asylum seekers themselves were dangerous.  When the Australian Government  convinced Nauru to be used as a staging post for Tampa  refugees, the Australian Air  Force flew in special security fences, ‘after publi c concern about refugees escaping  and endangering local citizens’ and Australian Fede ral Police and soldiers were  expected to help the Nauruan police keep guard ( SMH  8-9 September, 2001, 13).   

  Casting the asylum seekers as ‘persecutors’ and the  Australian people as ‘victims’,  allowed the Government to justify tougher legislati on in terms of its rescuing mission.   This legislation took the form of the border protec tion bill, described by Mike Carlton  (2001, 26) as ‘panicky legislation so madly draconi an that they could have ordered the 

  Navy to sink the entire Sydney-Hobart yacht fleet, quite legally, if someone in  Canberra felt like doing so’.  Before this bill, Ki m Beazley and Labor had been  paralleling Howard’s rescuing rhetoric.  Inability to offer immediate and unqualified  support for this bill left Labor behind in the resc uing Australia stakes.  By 4  September Howard’s approval rating had jumped 11 points to 57% and support for  him as preferred PM rose 5 points to 49% ( SMH  4 September 2001, 1).   

  In keeping with his ‘rescuer’ position, Howard cont inually took the moral high  ground: ‘I don’t see this in the context of the ele ction.  Please.  I’m doing what I think  is right for Australia’ ( SMH  30 August 2001, 1) and six days later ( SMH  5 September  2001, 1): ‘I didn’t do this for poll reasons’ as he  insisted that he still thought that the  election would be very hard to win.   

   5 

  Howard even tried to take the ethical high ground, in response to Mary Robinson’s  (UN High Commissioner for Refugees) plea to Australia to take the Asylum seekers  on humanitarian grounds, he said: ‘Australians have  looked into their hearts far more  genuinely than many other countries’ (SMH  1-2 September 2001, 1).  When the  Government suggested that the asylum seekers could be safely confined to Nauru, he  promised that ‘Australia would accept its “fair sha re” of those judged in Nauru to be  refugees.’ (SMH 4 September 2001, 1).   

  As the Government expected and enjoyed wide-spread public support for its stance  (SMH  30 August 2001, 7), columnists arrayed themselves on both sides, some  decrying the power of fear to overcome compassion (Kingston, 2001, 12) and others  reinforcing the Howard view that an ‘Open-door refugee policy is a recipe for  destruction’ (McGuiness, 2001, 12).  Ironically, ho wever, even those who opposed the  Howard position reinforced his operation of the pow er triangle by the language they  used.   

  Mike Carlton (2001, 26) intended to be facetious, b ut he effectively summed up the  ‘asylum seekers as persecutors’ line: ‘The boat peo ple are plainly your modern-day  Reds under the bed, contagious Islamic criminals co ming to rape our virgins and snare  our youth into the slavery of heroin’.  The use of language to position Howard as  ‘rescuer’ is evident in an equally facetious column  by Anthony Ackroyd (2001, 12): 

  Not for him the easy path of indiscriminate compass ion.  He has drawn a line  before the sand was even reached. … John has thrown down an anchor of  rock-solid resistance. … The Revolutionary Tax Tactician and the  Unapologetic White Thinking Australian have metamorphosed into the  Dinky-Di Dictator launching his armada against a Third World that just  doesn’t seem to understand plain English â KEEP OUT!   

  Can it be long before  Howard holds his first press conference dressed in battle  fatigues?   

  In a prophetic afterthought, Ackroyd adds ‘As well as the enemy at the gates, traitors  within must be summarily dealt with, too.  The defe nce of our nation is a never ending  battle for John.’  Similarly, Tony Squires (2001, 2 ), describes Howard (ironically) as  the man who shot Liberty Valance â a cowboy hero: ‘The ladies swooned, the men all  stepped aside to let him pass.’   

  By September 10, 44% of 350 voters surveyed said would vote for Howard because  of his handling of Tampa .  Only 16.4% said they were less likely to vote fo r him  (SMH  10 September 2001, 4).  On the day of 9/11 the Mor gan Poll found the  Government’s showing strongest for 2 years ( SMH 12 September 2001, 6).     

  It seems almost blasphemous to describe the events of 9/11 as ‘fortuitous’, but they  did indeed prove to be so for the Howard government as they enhanced the Karpman  Triangle script born of Tampa .  In the days immediately before 9/11 the construc t of  the Tampa  boat people as ‘persecutors’ had already generalis ed itself to Muslim  people.  ‘Barely have we recovered from the Asian b ogeyman of Pauline Hanson’s  imaginings than we are faced with the Muslim peril.  … Well-to-do Anglos in million  dollar pads declare their way of life is threatened  by asylum seekers in leaky boats. …  Given permission, Australians are quick to bring th eir prejudices to the surface, to 

   6 

  condemn whole races and religions’ (Horin, 2001, 37).  After 9/11 P.P. McGuiness  and others fuelled this prejudice (2001a, 24): ‘Isl am does seem to have encouraged a  culture of violence …For this reason it does make s ense to carefully screen  prospective immigrants’.   

  The attack on the twin-towers confirmed the ‘persec utor’ status with regard to  Australians of all Muslims and all asylum seekers a nd thereby assured the ‘rescuing’  Howard Government of victory in the polls; thus on 12 September the SMH  reported:  ‘the terror in the US has delivered Mr Howard a cro wning trifector .. the Government  is going to take some catching now … Suddenly, the GST, governemnt services and  petrol prices seem small beer … four teams of plane  hijackers halfway round the  world help voters here put in context what they sus pect about the few hundred  desperates the PM kept from our shores’ (Humphries, 2001, 3).    

  The Australian people’s view of themselves as victi ms was cemented by the Howard  reaction to the terrorist attack on the twin towers .    At a time when NSW Premier,  Bob Carr, tried to calm and reassure people by sayi ng a similar attack on Australia  was ‘unlikely’, Howard’s first coherent speech afte r the attack made use of the 

  opportunity to keep the Australian people afraid; h e said ‘the attack was an attack on  all of us, with all nations, including Australia, t hreatened by such sophisticated and  deadly terrorism’ ( SMH  12 September 2001, afternoon edition, 3).  He went  on to  warn ‘that people should not think Australia was im mune from what had happened in  the US.  Anyone who believed this was “deluding themselves”.  The threat of  terrorism will be with us in the way the threat of a nuclear war was around for so long  before the end of the Cold War’ he said.  ‘I think it is as bad as that and I don’t think  any of us should pretend otherwise’ (Grattan, 2001,  6). Needing Australians to  identify with the victim, Howard said ‘this is not just an assault on America.  It’s an  assault on the way of life that we hold dear in com mon’ ( SMH  14 September 2001, 6).     

  Howard, having made sure people were afraid, again assumed the mantle of ‘rescuer’;  he activated Australia’s counter-terrorism committe e and made the US an offer of  unlimited Australian help.  By September fifteenth he had invoked ANZUS to  promise that Australian troops would serve under US command in any retaliatory  strike against terrorists and their sponsors   

  Tampa  and 9/11 were used by John Howard to build a climate of fear that would  empower him.  His construct of himself as ‘rescuer’  of the frightened people was so  well established that the one catastrophe in this c alamitous month that might have  brought trouble for John Howard, the collapse of An sett, in fact also helped him by  reinforcing the national ‘wells of anxiety about th e changing world’ (Allard, 2001, 34)  and creating a sense of financial insecurity and jo b insecurity that contributed to the  national sense of powerlessness (Jamrozik and Sweeney, 1996, 40).  The  circumstances of the demise of Ansett also allowed another ‘persecutor’ to be found,  enhancing the Australian people’s sense of being vi ctims in need of rescue: ‘The  Government simply needs a villain [and] … can be grateful for the deception,  selfishness and sheer corporate bastardry of the Ai r New Zealand board and its  immoral junking of Ansett and its workers’ (Allard,  2001, 34).   

  The final gift to Howard before the election was th e ‘children overboard’ affair, which  built on the fertile ground of existing fear.  On 7  October, Ruddock told the media of 

   7 

  reports that children were thrown overboard in word s that cast the asylum seekers as  ‘persecutors’ and Australians as the ‘victims’: ‘we  are not going to be intimidated out  of our policy by this kind of behaviour ... I regar d this as one of the most disturbing 

  practices I’ve come across. It was clearly planned and premeditated’ (truthoverboard,  undated).   

  (This raises a cynical question of premeditated by whom?  During the Tampa crisis,  Howard had said: ‘Every situation has its 450 souls  … Every situation has stories of  hunger strikes, even suggestions of throwing childr en overboard’ (SMH  29 August  2001, 1).)   

  The following day, the Department of Foreign Affair s and Trade apparently told  Howard and some senior ministers that there was no reference to children thrown  overboard in the reports.  Notwithstanding this, Ho ward continued to use the story to  create new persecutors from whom the Government must defend the nation, saying on  the same day: ‘I express my anger at the behaviour of those people and I repeat it. I  can’t comprehend how genuine refugees would throw their children overboard’  (truthoverboard, undated).  In spite of growing evi dence that it was not the case, as 

  late as November 8, Howard repeated to the National Press Club his belief that  children were thrown overboard.  The election was h eld on 10 November 2001.  Not  until 13 February 2002 did Howard release the repor ts that revealed that children were  never thrown overboard.   

  Since the November 2001 victory, Howard Governments have maintained their  ‘rescuer’ status through sustaining a climate of fe ar.  As demonised ‘persecutors’ have  turned out to be harmless or non-existent (Saddam H ussein’s weapons of mass  destruction did not exist; boat people did not thro w children overboard; there have not  yet been any terrorist attacks on Australian soil),  new ‘persecutors’ have been found.   There are new waves of asylum seekers, new potential illegitimate owners of weapons 

  of mass destruction and fresh terrorist attacks any where in the world from London to  Bali that can be represented as attacks on Australi ans.  Mike Carlton (2005, 26)  challenges the effectiveness of this, but at the sa me time his column substantiates it as  a construct: ‘If John Howard feels that the masses are not treating his latest terrorist  scare as seriously as he would wish, he has only hi mself to blame.  He has cried wolf  too often, most notably with Saddam’s non-existent weapons of mass destruction’.     There is little evidence that Carlton is right abou t the masses losing faith in Howard.   In the 2004 election, we showed how much we trust him, or at least have been  convinced that we need him to rescue us; the Coalit ion won 45.1 % of the Senate  vote, 46.7 % of the Lower House vote and a majority  in both Houses.  In the first 

  Newspoll for 2006 Howard had 30% more support as preferred Prime Minister than  Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, and half the  people polled were satisfied with  Mr Howard's performance, an 8 percent rise from the previous poll at the end of 2005 

  (Canberra Times , 18 January, 2006).   

  We now have the three pre-conditions for fascism: a  strong government, a weak  opposition and a climate of fear.  As fear lulls us  into a sense of dependence, the line  between the rescuer and the persecutor is becoming increasingly blurred.  The rescuer  is driven by his need to be in control of the rescu e and his arrogance in assuming that  he is destined to rescue others and therefore stron ger and wiser than they are; he  knows what is good for them.  For our own good, ‘re scuer’ Howard has steadily 

   8 

  encroached on traditional rights and freedoms.  To rescue us from unemployment, the  long standing basis of our arbitration and concilia tion system has been removed by  new workplace legislation; to rescue us from strike s and inflation, WorkChoice  legislation has been put in place; to rescue us fro m imminent terrorist attacks, control  orders and preventive detention orders have been le gislated; to rescue us from the  enemies within, new sedition laws have been passed.   Even welfare-to-work is  depicted as a rescuing strategy: ‘to help [people] to find work that suits them, and to  continue to support them if they can’t find work, o r if they can’t work at all’ (Philip  Knox, spokesman for Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, Sun  Herald  18 December 2005, 25).  The new approach is summed up by Julia Baird,  ‘Today’s politicians promise not to deliver us our dreams, but to rescue us from our  nightmares’ (2005, 11).   

  If the theoretical framework of this paper is valid , then in the current climate the  Opposition will not succeed in dislodging the Gover nment until it engages with the  emotional triangle which Howard has so successfully invoked.  It will need to appear  as a more powerful rescuer than the incumbent Government and/or change 

  perceptions so that enough voters see the tendency of Howard, the rescuer, to adopt  what is in reality persecuting behaviour.
