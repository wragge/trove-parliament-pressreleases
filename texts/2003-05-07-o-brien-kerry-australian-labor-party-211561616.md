 KERRY O’BRIEN  LABOR SENATOR FOR TASMANIA  SHADOW MINISTER FOR PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND RESOURCES 

 

 

 7 May 2003 

 

 O’BRIEN WELCOMES CANCER FIGHTING CATTLEMEN TO TASMANIA   

 Labor Senator Kerry O’Brien welcomes Dan and Tim Phegan, Colin Mitchell, Luke  Rusin and Geoff Willis of Campfires Against Cancer to Tasmania as they will continue  their epic pan-Australia horse ride and cattle drive to raise money for cancer research. 

 Driven by the loss of his grandfather Herbert Freyer to cancer, Dan Phegan hatched a  plan to ride from Darwin in the Northern Territory to Corryong in Victoria to raise  funds to fight cancer. 

 Along the 10-month journey, which began in June 2002, Dan and his team raised  $513,000 for the Cancer Council through raffles and other fund raising activities  including selling cattle donated by farmers along the route. 

 The story of this ride through regional Australia, including the generosity of regional  Australians, is a tribute to the Australian spirit. 

 Having completed their ride across the mainland, Dan, Tim, Colin, Luke and Geoff  have arrived in Tasmania to finish the job. 

 I warmly welcome Dan and the Campfires Against Cancer team to Tasmania, and  wish them all the best in their efforts. 

 I also encourage the Tasmanian people to support the Campfires Against Cancer  riders in completing their momentous journey.

 The Campfires journey officially ended in Corryong 11th April 2003 after raising $512,000 for  the Cancer Council of Australia.   

 Most of the team have had to go back to work and try and regain their lives after 10 months  on the road. Four of the original team didn’t have to start work until the 1st July so found  themselves with itchy feet and a desire to ride to the coast. Crazy but loveable these guys  are. They really wanted to make it a “boys” trip and still try and raise funds for the Cancer  Council of Australia since they had along with the original crew raised $513,000 for Research  into an eventual cure into Cancer.   

 Tasmanian Leg crew members:  Dan Phegan and Colin Mitchell have ridden every step from Darwin to Melbourne and now  Tasmania. That is over 5,000 kilometres through some very tough conditions. They’ve  weathered the drought, bushfires, dust storms and much much more to raise these much  needed funds.   

 Luke Rusin has been official support crew from Darwin. Luke was 21 years old when they left  for Darwin at the beginning of June 2002 and gave up his Electrical Apprenticeship to do this  ride. His now 22 yrs & a very mature young man. A champion support crew member!.   

 Tim Phegan who joined the team full-time three months before the ride ended in Corryong.  Tim couldn’t commit the full 10 - 11 months but dropped everything whenever the team  needed him.   

 Geoff Willis - 2002 Man from Snowy River Challenge winner. We met Geoff in Tamworth  2003 and his been a great mate ever since. The boys are delighted he could take the time to  ride with them.   

 They have 9 horses with them for this leg and Dan, Colin and Geoff and the riders with Tim  and Luke providing essential support services
