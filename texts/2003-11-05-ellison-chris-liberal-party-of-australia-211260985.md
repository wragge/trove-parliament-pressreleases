 Labor sticks with soft approach to border protection 

 

 As a result of the Australian Government’s tough border protection policy, no illegal vessel has  landed on the Australian mainland since December 2001.  

 The Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Chris Ellison, said that in the case of the vessel off  Melville Island the passengers and crew had failed in their attempt to set foot on the Australian  mainland.  

 “The Australian Government has sent a clear message to those seeking to illegally enter Australia by  boat that they will not be successful,” Senator Ellison said. 

 Labor’s border protection record when it was in government was abysmal and its current actions  demonstrate it still doesn’t understand the importance of a tough approach to border protection.  

 Labor’s $612.5 million coastguard proposal will gut the Navy and is little more than an expensive  bureaucratic reshuffle. 

 “The response by Customs, the Australian Federal Police, the Royal Australian Navy and the  Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to the attempt to land on Melville  Island was swift and effective, and they are to be congratulated on their quick response to this  matter,” Senator Ellison said. 

 “The use of the Customs Hotline to alert authorities in this case again highlights the value of the  cooperation between Customs and the community in looking after Australia and protecting our  borders.” 

 Senator Ellison expressed the Government’s appreciation for the cooperation shown by the people of  Melville Island. 

 Labor’s continued attempts to score political points in relation to Australia’s border protection  reveals their cynical approach to an issue important to Australians. 

 The Howard Government has put in place unprecedented measures to enhance border protection for  Australia, and will continue to give it the highest priority.
