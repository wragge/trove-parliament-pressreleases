 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling LABOR STILL LIVING IN FISCAL FANTASIES  AS MORE THAN 22,000 PEOPLE ARRIVE  THIS FINANCIAL YEAR May 27, 2013

 Another illegal boat arrival, carrying 82 people, has been intercepted at Cocos Islands, whilst Labor continues to  deliberately distort boat arrival predictions, Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Shadow Minister  for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “Today in Senate Estimates the Department of Immigration confirmed that it was standing by its prediction of 13,200 illegal arrivals by boat next year, despite the record breaking numbers continuing to arrive on our shores,” Mr Keenan said.

 “This prediction of 13,200 arrivals for next year is total fiscal fantasy given that the Department spokesperson also  confirmed they were predicting 25,000 arrivals for this financial year alone.

 “2013 has already brought 148 boats and over 10,000 people to Australia’s shores courtesy of people smugglers - and it  is only May.

 “On top of this April was the biggest month for boat arrivals ever on record, reinforcing that these unprecedented numbers  are only continuing to grow under Labor. 

 “To then turn around and argue that a prediction that would have to see numbers of arrivals drop by more than 10,000 by  next year is simply ludicrous - especially when this Government is not proposing any changes to the current border  protection policies that has led to this crisis in the first place.

 “This Government has no credibility on our borders or the budget,” Mr Keenan said.
