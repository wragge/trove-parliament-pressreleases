 Who Cares?  A study of diverse care arrangements in Australian society.  A paper  discussing findings from the Diverse Care Project.  AIFS Conference 2000 

 The Diverse Care project being conducted in the Department of Family and Community  Services has identified a number of instances in which formal administrative  arrangements for paying family assistance do not fit well with the family structures of  various groups.  This paper describes some of the ways we are working to ensure  intended outcomes for children are achieved. 

 Family assistance payments contribute to stronger families through supplementing family  income.  The intent of the payments is to assist with the costs of having and raising  children. 

 Family Allowance was paid for long term, ongoing care and assumes that a child will  benefit when payment is made to a ‘primary carer’ who is usually a woman.1 That  assumption is valid for a majority of Australian families and works when the family is  stable and parents have care of children from birth to adulthood. Yet, as the Diverse Care  project has already demonstrated, the assumption is not valid for a range of minority  groups within the total family customer population.  Those minorities constitute some of  the most disadvantaged in our society. 

 Course of the Diverse Care Project 

 Cordelia Hull and I 2gave some account of the origins of the Diverse Care Project at the  November 1998 Australian Institute of Family Studies conference 3.  I can now report on  progress and offer a commentary on some findings and on further action being taken. 

 In the first phase of the project, we drew qualitative data from several series of focus  groups, workshops and consultations. We have since moved to the second phase which  involves testing the findings by setting up a Statement of Care pilot with more flexible  payment approaches for indigenous family groups in five locations around the country.  Phase two of the Diverse Care project might best be described as a program of continuous  process and policy improvement. 

 

 1  From 1 July 2000 Family Allowance and other family assistance payments have been replaced by Family  Tax Benefit.  Family Tax Benefit is paid to a primary carer and retains the same policy rationale as Family  Allowance.  2

 Characteristics of sample 

 Three broad groups of family types were selected for study in the first phase of the  project that was completed in December 1999. The interim findings cover concerns raised  by indigenous family groups, a selection of newly arrived ethnic community and family  groups, and a number of other groups whose family structures can be regarded as  atypical. 

 All groups demonstrated varying degrees of child mobility that is, children moved from  one relative or carer to another for a range of reasons or were shared by two or more  carers.  For example, findings from workshops with indigenous family groups confirmed  a range of issues arising from the characteristics of their child raising patterns.  These  have also been discussed in a recent report by the Centre for Aboriginal and Economic  Policy Research, Australian National University. 

 Indigenous family groups. 

 Indigenous family representatives were consulted in remote, regional and urban areas.  The prototype for a series of workshops with indigenous family groups came from a 1998  meeting at Tennant Creek, Northern Territory with Barkly Tableland women. This  provided valuable insights into the most pressing needs of families in relation to Family  Allowance payment arrangements. 

 It also gave us a chance to test run questions and ideas that were later discussed with  indigenous families in seven locations around the country (as detailed in Attachment A).  Their family structures were essentially large extended families that in many instances  shared the care of children between several relatives over varying periods of time. 

 Indigenous workshop participants were invited to discuss issues relating to their children  and families. They talked of their child raising patterns, their concerns with child neglect,  and the difficulties they faced in dealing with government at all levels.  Isolation and  communication barriers exacerbated their problems.  They were emphatic about the  mismatch between their non-nuclear family structures and the conditions they are  required to meet under family assistance payment arrangements.  Significantly, their use  of the term “Kids’ Money” to describe payments reflects an accurate understanding of the  policy intent. 

 The payment arrangements for family assistance payments do not accommodate the high  mobility of indigenous children.  A primary carer must notify Centrelink whenever a  child moves into the care of another person, even within an extended family group.  When care is short term, or of unknown length, a new claim from the actual carer is not  necessarily accepted and generally payment continues to go to the primary carer.  Only if  the new claim is accepted is the ‘losing’ carer’s payment cancelled.

 Indigenous families saw these arrangements as a source of tension within extended  families. They wanted ‘government policies’ to respect and support the role of their  extended families. They spoke of their cultural obligation to care for other relatives’  children as they came to stay with them. They were acutely aware of the purpose of  family assistance or Kids’ Money.  Their cultural and family obligation meant they cared  for children as they arrived from others without asking for financial contributions from  the child’s parents or previous carers. 

 Grandmothers often took children in for unpredictable periods.  They did not want to  initiate claims for payment because of the angst that this caused within the family.  Making a claim meant the current recipient would lose a considerable proportion of her  income. 

 Workshop participants reported many disputes over Family Allowance monies.  They  also reported that the use of Family Allowance for other purposes such as alcohol and  drugs resulted in under nourishment and other forms of child neglect. 

 Child protection authorities used child mobility (or changes of care even within extended  family groups) as evidence of child neglect.  Indigenous women said this made them even  more reluctant to tell “government” that children had moved into the care of another  person. 

 Indigenous participants wanted some way of ensuring Family Allowance could follow  each child as he or she moved from carer to carer.   Payment arrangements do not  currently facilitate payment when a child moves between different carers within the same  family group.  There was an obvious need for more flexible arrangements and perhaps a  rethink of the notification provisions to accommodate shared child- raising practices.  These issues are being progressed through the Statement of Care pilot that is discussed  later in this paper. 

 Culturally and Linguistically Diverse families 

 When looking at the circumstances of some culturally and linguistically diverse families  we found that they too experienced situations comparable to indigenous families.  These  arose partly from their extended family structures. 

 The sample of ethnic families participating in project consultations was selected from  Centrelink records of Family Allowance customers.  Focus groups were held in 1999  with customers from the following cultural and linguistic groups: 

 â¢ Arabic speaking  â¢ Pacific Islanders i.e. Samoans and Tongans  â¢ Horn of Africa i.e. Somalis, Eritreans, and Ethiopians

 5 

 Groups were selected after discussions with the Multicultural Customer Segment in  Centrelink, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, and the Australian Bureau  of Statistics.  We also consulted migrant and ethnic community bodies including the  Federation of Ethnic Communities Council of Australia, Migrant Resource Centres, and  Ethnic Child Care Development agencies. The groups were selected in an effort to  include refugees, recent arrivals and long term migrants to reflect their varying  experiences and views. 

 The groups represented families and children who had arrived in Australia in the last five  years.  As groups they were expected to retain strong cultural links that impacted on  family structures and child raising patterns.  The objective in talking to these people was  to identify their caring arrangements and to identify any problems arising from family  assistance because of those arrangements.  Many of the focus group participants were  refugee women some of whom had lost their partners in conflicts of war.  Some were sole  parents with higher than average (more than three) numbers of dependent children.  For many participants moving to Australia meant relinquishing the support of extended  families until they were able to bring them here.  In the interim some families took on the  more nuclear family structure widely practiced here, others retained the extended family  networks with family members who already arrived. 

 None of the three ethnic groups perceived any difficulty in meeting the requirement to  nominate a primary carer with ongoing care of a child for payment.  In practice  nonetheless, they often shared the caring and decision making of their children with those  members of their extended family living in Australia.  A typical example of this was that  children were placed in the care of relatives when parents went overseas for long periods  of up to a year. 

 Muslim women indicated that caring and financial decisions were shared with their  partners and said that occasionally relatives from within the extended family made  decisions for them.  This included help with child raising and respite care needs.  The  Muslim community influenced the placements of foster children within the cultural group  because participants said children needed to learn customs and become familiar with  cultural issues. 

 There is scope for further investigation of how family assistance arrangements affect  other ethnic family types with extended family caring patterns. 

 Families with other diverse care contexts. 

 A third group studied included a mixed group of Family Allowance customers, including  sole parents.  Families were invited to participate in the project because of their possible  experience with children going in and out of foster care placements, institutions and  respite care. They included foster carers, representatives of foster care agencies and  grandparents who cared for grandchildren whose parents were repeat drug offenders.

 6 

 Single income families were also represented, along with separated or divorced parents  who shared the care of children under court orders or parenting plans.  Some paid child  support and many received it.  In general the group reflected the increasing incidence of  divorced, separated and blended families with children, and atypical (or non-nuclear)  caring and child raising arrangements.   The group had a degree of child mobility with  children moving between carers for a range of reasons. 

 Some sole parent participants said they needed better access to respite care because they  feared state child protection authorities would remove their children.  They said caring  for children as a sole parent was stressful and without relief and put the children at risk of  abuse. 

 Foster/substitute care is one element of contemporary family relationships impacting on  the lives of around 16,000 children each year.4  In extreme cases children are removed for  their own safety from their parents or carers by State and Territory child protection  authorities. 

 Those families lose entitlement to family assistance in due course once it is established  that a new carer (a foster carer) has ongoing care of the child. There may be a delay  before a magistrate makes an order for the child to be removed temporarily or  permanently.  Or it may be ruled that the child may be returned as soon as possible to the  family. In many cases the situation when a child leaves is unclear to the losing family and  the foster carer.  Parents said that because they did not know how permanent a placement  would be, and hoped the child would return quickly, they were reluctant to tell  Centrelink. The uncertainty of the situation meant they were sometimes overpaid Family  Allowance. 

 Where a foster carer claimed Family Allowance for a foster child, (after establishing  ‘ongoing care’), and payment to the parent was cancelled, this reportedly had a negative  impact on the relationship between the parent and the foster carer.  Low-income parents  faced the loss of a significant part of their resources when losing Family Allowance for a  child.  This sometimes meant losing access to accommodation deemed suitable for the  child’s return. 

 All State and Territory child protection authorities practice the gradual  restoration/reunification of foster children to their natural or birth parents.  Such  processes take many weeks or months with varied success.  Families said they needed  Family Allowance to help them meet the costs of having the child back.  They were not  entitled to payment during these transitional phases but foster carers continued to receive  payment despite not having the child constantly.  Recognising the costs families face  without Family Allowance supplementation, some States and Territories meet some of  the costs arising from the restoration, but a number do not.

 Key Issues: variety and continuity of care 

 Looking at the child raising patterns in the three groups studied has shown that it is  frequently difficult for carers within the groups to establish qualification for family  assistance.  Each group consulted in the project reported issues arising from two key  areas of concern. 

 First, a variety of people, not one primary carer, may share the care of one child.  Indigenous children, for example, move between different carers within and beyond  extended family structures.  It is difficult to identify one primary carer when a child  moves as often as several times a week. 

 The second factor is mobility: children move, for example, between foster parents and  natural parents. Ethnic children move from carer to carer.  Such mobility, producing  frequent changes of care, conflicts with the assumed ‘ongoing care’ requirement for  entitlement to family assistance. 

 Family assistance is payable to a person or primary carer for the ongoing care of a child  so that the child may have continuous benefit of the assistance.  In practice the project has  found that this continuity may be broken in the following circumstances; 

 â¢ Foster care placements, often for periods of unknown and unpredictable length  â¢ Family reunification/restoration process in which a foster child is progressively  returned to his or her original family under State and Territory child protection  arrangements 

 â¢ Short term placements in respite care  â¢ When children are in the care of several different people within an extended family,  and  â¢ When children are shared between separated or divorced parents. 

 There are also some issues that need policy attention in the short-term care arrangements  for foster care.  These issues have implications for determining who should supplement  the costs of children moving into and out of foster care placements.  Commonwealth  payments do not automatically adjust to circumstances dictated by State and Territory  welfare departments.  In some cases that results in low-income parents having to meet  additional costs arising from transitional phases of care. 

 These issues are being pursued in two ways; firstly, by testing more flexible payment  arrangements in a Statement of Care pilot with volunteer indigenous families.  Secondly,  we are considering new approaches for children moved between carers at the intervention  of State and Territory welfare authorities.

 Statement of Care Pilot 

 The Statement of Care pilot is seeking to address some of the problems arising from the  variety of carers and the mobility of indigenous children.   The idea came from the  concerns expressed in Diverse Care project workshops by indigenous families.  They  were troubled by the interactions of family assistance payment arrangements and their  child raising practices.  The pilot will test an approach that encourages indigenous  recipients to redirect family assistance to others within an identified group of usual  carers. 

 The pilot commenced in May 2000 and is likely to continue until February or March  2001.  It is being conducted in Wreck Bay, Nowra and Wollongong, NSW;  Yarrabah/Cairns and Cherbourg in Queensland; Suburban Melbourne, and Port Augusta,  in South Australia.  .

 The pilot has developed through a long consultative process during which many  indigenous families have expressed a keen enthusiasm to participate. Participants in the  process are involved in forming care groups with other members of their extended  families.  They also agree to pass on family assistance to the person who currently has  care of the child as a means of ensuring better outcomes for children. 

 The success of the pilot depends on group and individual understanding of the agreement  to redirect funds and on peer group pressure. Each care group member is responsible for  passing around family assistance funds as each child moves to other carers.  They are not  required to formally tell Centrelink the child has moved. 

 There is an element of reciprocity in the piloted arrangements.  Being in a care group  means taking responsibility for making sure children get benefit from funds intended for  their costs, and in legal terms ‘delegating care of children’ to others when children move.  Peer group pressure can be an effective way of ensuring each individual conforms to the  group agreement.  Such pressure is instrumental in the success of number of poverty  alleviation projects underway in developing countries .5 

 Care groups in the pilot are being supported in each location by small project teams  comprising indigenous liaison officers, local community representatives and other Family  and Community Services employees.  In setting up the process and asking people to  participate, local project teams encountered some degree of mistrust.

Small business loans are provided to groups of poor people, who then each invest individually in their  chosen trade.  Paying back the money- in weekly instalments with interest â is the responsibility of the  whole group.  Such projects operate on the principle of reciprocal or mutual obligation.

 People in a Torres Strait Islander Community outside Cairns had to understand the  identity of the Commonwealth Department of Family and Community Services before  they agreed to participate. They confused us with what was once the Queensland  Department of Family and Community Services â the ones who removed children from  their families. 

 The local project teams are monitoring progress in each location, and we plan to hold  workshops with participants at the end of each leg to get first hand information of their  experiences and reactions.  There is already evidence that families have found the  arrangements empower them to manage their own families in a way that suits their  natural child raising patterns. 

 Foster care: the short term transitions 

 Similarly we are currently looking at new approaches to address broken periods of family  assistance entitlement for children in short term foster care.  We are investigating ways of  ensuring families going through the transitional phases of restoration processes can meet  their children’s costs more easily. A possible response would be to direct payment to  families involved in a restoration process as if they already had ongoing care of the child.  Cost, of course, is a consideration. 

 Conclusions 

 On 16 April 2000 the Prime Minister announced the Government’s “ Stronger Families  and Communities Strategy”.  As Family and Community Services Executive Director,  Robyn McKay, has said; 

 “ We will have the privilege of modelling at every level the partnerships that lie at the heart of new social  policy  directions.   At  a  practical  level  we  can  make  an  enormous  difference  to  the  experience  and  opportunities of Australian families and communities by enabling and encouraging partnerships which need  not depend on government at all. 

 We  will  be  breaking  new  ground  on  a  number  of  fronts  at  once.   The  Strategy  requires  us  to  become  facilitators  â  rather  than  national  “experts”--  who  support  families  and  communities  to  bring  forward  initiatives which will best address their local needs.” 6 

 That includes better outcomes for children in extended family groups, and those at risk.  The Diverse Care Project is highlighting previously unacknowledged realities for certain  groups in Australian society. We have identified two factors that affect the policy intent  of families’ assistance. A child might move from carer to carer or be in the care of several  different carers at the same time.  Linked with that, changes of circumstances enforce  extraordinary mobility on some children. These factors make it difficult for some children  to receive the benefits intended from continuity of payment.

 It is always tempting to say that the solution lies in cutting through “bureaucratic red- tape” and make arrangements tailored to every individual’s circumstances. In many of the  cases we have studied, the issue is not whether people continue to remain eligible but  whether they are in a position to report every time their eligibility changes. The family  structures of the identified groups do not match the assumptions embedded in the  arrangements designed for the majority of Australian families. 

 One approach could be to require all families to adjust to the norm and either meet  normal eligibility requirements or go without income support.  Clearly that approach  would not meet our policy commitments to building stronger families and stronger  communities. Just as clearly, as findings from the Diverse Care Project indicate, the  enforcement of such requirements is unlikely to be effective. For these groups the  standard requirement of reporting changes of care whenever a child has moved out of  “ongoing care” is often impracticable. 

 The Diverse Care project suggests that encouraging recipients to take responsibility for  ensuring that payments are applied to the costs of caring for children is likely to be more  effective than on the enforcement of arbitrary payment procedures. That approach  expresses the principle of “mutual obligation” in seeking better outcomes for children  regardless of differences in family structures.

 Attachment A 

 Diverse Care Project 

 Consultations 

 Group One â Indigenous families 

 Workshops were held with a range of indigenous families and their representatives in  Launceston, Tasmania; Katanning, Western Australia; Mount Druitt, New South Wales;  Katherine, Northern Territory; Thursday Island in the Torres Strait, Cairns, Queensland;  and Mount Martha, Victoria. 

 Group Two    -  Culturally and linguistically diverse families 

 Focus groups with ethnic families were conducted in 1999 with the cooperation and  assistance of the Centrelink Multicultural Customer Segment.  A focus group was held in  Lakemba, Sydney with 22 female and 2 male customers who were predominantly  Muslims and Christians from Lebanon, Egypt and Syria.  Focus groups were also held in  Logan City, Brisbane with 40 female and male customers from Samoa and Tonga.  Other  focus groups were held with 17 females and 3 males from three cultural groups from  Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia including Muslims and Orthodox Christians in Melbourne. 

 Group Three -  Other diverse care contexts 

 Workshop consultations were held in 1999 with 18 male and female customers in  Newcastle, NSW, 15 male and female customers in Melbourne, and 26 female customers  in Christie Downs, Adelaide.  The community groups who attended included the Ethnic  Communities Council of Newcastle and the Hunter region, the Foster Care Association,  the Offenders Aid Rehabilitation Service (SA), Tarin House (a halfway house for  reoffenders), Grandparents who Parent, and the Council for Single Women.

 Profiles of customer populations from which groups were sampled 

 Group One â Indigenous families 

 In March 2000, there were 40,516 Family Allowance (FA) customers also identifying as Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander.  (The number may be higher as the indigenous identifier is a voluntary  field on Family Allowance claims forms).  Of these 5555 received minimum rate FA and 34,961  received more than minimum rate of FA.  7 

 Customers identifying as indigenous currently comprise 2.3% of the total FA customer population. 

 The average rate of FA was approximately $92 per child per fortnight compared with $60.6 per  child for non-indigenous families. 

 In 2000-2001 estimated outlays in Family Tax Benefit Part A  (the equivalent of FA) for  indigenous families are expected to be $404.3 million. 

 Group Two- Culturally and linguistically diverse families 

 a.  On 10 March 2000, there were a total of 21,070 Family Allowance customers who identified as  being from Egypt, Syria and Lebanon.  Of these 4,624 customers received minimum rate FA, and  16,446 received more than the minimum rate FA.  Customers identifying as being from these  three countries comprised 1.21% of the total FA population of 1,731,693 as at March 2000. 

 Total Family Allowance outlays for this group were $104.3million per year. 

 b. On 10 March 2000, there were a total 5,683 customers whose country of birth was Samoa  (including American Samoa) and Tonga receiving Family Allowance.  Of these 1,276  customers received minimum rate FA and 4,407 received more than the minimum rate FA.  They comprised 0.32% of the total FA population of 1,731,693 on that date. 

 Total Family Allowance outlays for this group were $0.32million per year. 

 c. On 10 March 2000, there were a total of 1,864 Family Allowance customers from Eritrea,  Ethiopia, and Somalia.  Of these, 250 customers received minimum rate FA, and 1,614  received more than the min rate FA.  They comprised 0.1% of the total FA population on that  date. 

 Total Family Allowance outlays for the group at that time were $14.9 million per year.
