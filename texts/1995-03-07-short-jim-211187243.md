  The Coalition strongly supports the principle underlying the Governments Migf . . lf b grounds  Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995, namely that China's One Child Policy should not m itse e  for the grant of refugee status in Australia. 

  S legitimate concerns 

  The Coalition, however, has several concerns about the Bill as drafted. trong ill (N 3) 1995 by  were voiced by many witnesses at the recent inquiry into Migration Amendment B . o. esented a  the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. Coalition Senators on that Cornrmttee pr  dissenting report which shared many of the concerns expressed by witnesses. 

  The Government has attempted to meet some of these concerns in Migration Legislation  Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995, which is to replace Bill No. 3.

  On this basis the Coalition will support its passage through the Parliament.

  No.4. Once again the Minister, Senator Bolkus, has shown a sloppy, incompetent approach to this  important portfolio. It is his ineptitude that has caused the concerns and confusion about Bill No. 3,  and which have not as yet been rectified satisfactorily in Bill No. 4. 

  It is high time that the Prime Minister replaced Senator Bolkus with someone capable of handling  immigration and ethnic affairs policy competently and professionally.
