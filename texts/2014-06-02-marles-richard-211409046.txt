 MEDIA RELEASE   

 BUDGET OF BROKEN PROMISES SLAMS DOOR ON FAMILY VISAS   

 The Abbott Governmentâ€™s Budget of broken promises has delivered a cruel blow  to ethnic communities by closing the door on low and middle-income earners  ever bringing their parents to Australia.    

 After callously cutting funding to the Refugee Council, Scott Morrison has now  reduced the chances of people ever bringing their parents to Australia by  abolishing the Non-contributory Parent visa.   

 The Budget papers released announced that new applications under the Non-contributory Parent visa category and Other Family visa Category (including Aged  Dependent Relative, Remaining Relative and Carer) would be abolished.   

 In a mean and sneaky move Scott Morrison has snuck this through by Legislative  Instrument and will come into effect today with absolutely no notice to the  community.    

 This is an unfair and cruel move by a Government that is completely out of touch  with ethnic communities.   

 This decision by the Abbott Government will mean low and middle-income  families will have no way of bringing their parents to Australia, unless they can  fork out up to $125,000.
