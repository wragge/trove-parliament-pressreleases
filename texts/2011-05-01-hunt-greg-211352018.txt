 TONY ABBOTT:    

 The Prime Minister’s back now from the royal wedding and it’s important that the right finishing touches be  put on the Budget. Now, it should include a serious boost to mental health funding and I would urge the  Prime Minister to emulate the Coalition’s proposal to spend $1.9 billion on better mental health services. I  think that’s the minimum necessary to give mental health patients the treatment that they need. I think the  Prime Minister needs to adopt the four-point plan for participation reform that the Coalition outlined three  weeks ago. If she’s serious about welfare reform, that’s what she’ll do.    

 But above all else, the Prime Minister must include the carbon tax details in the Budget. If the Budget  doesn’t include all the details about the carbon tax - including what it will do to peoples’ cost of living, what  it will do to jobs in this country - the Budget will not be worth the paper that it’s printed on.    

 QUESTION:   

 Just on the Budget, will you announce budget savings in your Budget Reply speech?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 What I’ll be doing in the Budget Reply speech is holding the government to account and be outlining an  alternative vision for our country. I think people are starting to be a little bit embarrassed about this  Government and I think they’re looking to the Coalition to provide a credible alternative.    

 QUESTION:   

 The Government’s forecasting an extra 500,000 jobs will be created in the next few years. Do you think that  shows they’re being good economic managers?

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I don’t think the Government can credibly talk about jobs to be created unless they talk about the jobs that  will be destroyed by their carbon tax. We’ve had the South Australian branch of the Australian Workers’  Union talk about turning Whyalla and Port Pirie into ghost towns if the carbon tax goes ahead. This carbon  tax will very badly damage steel making, aluminium making, motor manufacturing and cement  manufacturing in this country. It will export jobs to China and Indonesia and it will import emissions. This  Government can’t credibly talk about job creation if it’s not going to talk about the jobs impact of its carbon  tax.   

 QUESTION:   

 Do you think those job losses would negate the jobs they’re talking about being created?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, this is just pie-in-the-sky stuff from the Government and as the workers in the steel industry, the  aluminium industry and the motor industry well know, a job in the hand is worth two in the bush.   

 QUESTION:   

 Just on the issue of immigration, Chris Bowen says immigration detention staff already have the power to  revoke privileges. How is your policy any different?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well our policy is to actually do something about people who destroy Australian property and assault  Australian officials. The Government’s policy is to give people visas notwithstanding the fact that they are  guilty of assaulting Australian officers and destroying Australian taxpayers’ property.   

 QUESTION:   

 [inaudible] the core points of your own policy?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 We think there has got to be serious consequences for people who commit offences while in detention and  those consequences should range up to and include detention and deportation.   

 QUESTION:   

 Do you believe your policy will guarantee will help to stop the boats?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 There are a range of things that need to happen to stop the boats but you certainly don’t stop the boats by  rewarding people who have been guilty of rioting in Australian detention centres.   

 QUESTION:   

 So do you not believe that the refugees themselves have the right to protest?

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I don’t believe that anyone who comes to this country illegally then has a right to act illegally once they’re  here.    

 QUESTION:   

 Does that include protesting?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 People have no right to come to this country illegally and to act illegally once they’re here.   

 QUESTION:   

 And just one more question, Lindsay Tanner has called politics a sideshow. Do you think that you are part of  the sideshow?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I think that politics under the current Government has been all about headlines and not about good  administration and I think if this was a Government that was better at government and less obsessed with  spin; if we had a government that wasn’t all about spin and deals, we would be much better off as a country.    

 GREG HUNT:    

 I might just say one thing. If the Budget doesn’t include the carbon tax and the electricity costs for families,  it will be nothing more than a phantom document.    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Alan, did you want to say something, mate?   

 ALAN TUDGE:   

 We’re here today - Tony Abbott and Greg Hunt are here - running in the Puffing Billy race, where we did it  not only to support Puffing Billy, but also to raise the profile and raise some funds for youth mental health  charities. In particular, we raised $10,000 for the headspace Foundation and $9,000 for the Butterfly  Foundation. So, they are both very worthy causes.
