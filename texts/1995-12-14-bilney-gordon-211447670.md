 AUSTRALIA HELPS REBUILD HEALTH SERVICES IN RWANDA

 Rehabilitating health services in the south of Rwanda is the focus of Australia's latest $5-  million contribution to help the African nation rebuild after last year's devastating civil war  and genocide, the Minister for Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney, said today.

 Mr Bilney also released a new quarterly newsletter, Relief Review*. Produced by the  Australian Agency for International Development - AusAID, Relief Review will keep  Australians informed of the Government's humanitarian relief work.

 "The Government was determined that the generosity of the Australian public in responding  to emergency appeals during the Rwandan crisis be matched by a dedicated and focussed  contribution to rebuilding the country.

 "Over the next twelve months Australian funds will be used to help repair and re-equip health  facilities wrecked by looting, train health workers and rehabilitate water supplies for health  centres," Mr Bilney said.

 AusAID will fund projects by international organisations and Australian NGOs including:

 â¢ $1 million to UNICEF to reconnect the water supply to the Butare Hospital and twenty  health centres in the region and for an immunisation project

 â¢ $1.4 million to the World Health Organisation (WHO) to re-establish a regional  primary health service, including training 500 health workers

 â¢ $900 000 to Community Aid Abroad to rehabilitate water supplies in 12 communes

 â¢ $800 000 to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for health  activities supporting the return of an anticipated 1 million refugees in the coming year

 â¢ $475 000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to provide medical  relief to Rwandan prisoners

 â¢ $200 000 to support two Australian visiting specialists - a general surgeon and an  orthopaedic surgeon - to work at the Kigali Central Hospital to upgrade local doctor's  skills

 Release

 â¢ $200 000 for the purchase of the equipment used by the Australian Defence Force Medical Corps during their mission. This equipment is now installed at Kigali Central  Hospital

 "The health focus of our support builds on the excellent contribution made by medical teams  from the Australian Defence Force during their twelve month deployment in Rwanda," Mr  Bilney said.

 "By working closely with the Rwandan Ministry of Health and concentrating on the Butare  region of southern Rwanda, we can be sure that our contribution will have a lasting impact.

 "The thousands of Australians who contributed so generously to last year's emergency .  appeals for Rwanda can be justifiably proud of the assistance their government is providing  to rebuild the country."
