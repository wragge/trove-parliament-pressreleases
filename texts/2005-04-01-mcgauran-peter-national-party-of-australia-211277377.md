 Cultural Diversity at Work in Sydney’s South West

 1 April 2005 

 The Australian Government is continuing to help thousands of migrants and refugees successfully settle in South West  Sydney every year. 

 The Federal Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Peter McGauran, today met with Canterbury-Bankstown  Migrant Resource Centre’s Chairman Ms Pauline Gallagher, Centre Coordinators Ms Violet Roumeliotis and Ms Esta  Paschalidis-Chilas, staff and board members.

 ‘More than 11 000 migrants have settled in Canterbury Bankstown in the past five years from countries as diverse as  Lebanon and Vietnam. Of these, almost 2000 people were granted visas on humanitarian grounds from countries including  Afghanistan, Ethiopia and other African countries,’ Minister McGauran said.

 ‘Canterbury Bankstown is one of Sydney’s most culturally diverse areas with almost 50 percent of residents born overseas.

 ‘The Migrant Resource Centre creates a vital link between the incoming settlers and their new community by providing  assistance in a variety of areas including housing and employment. 

 ‘Through this support, migrants and refugees develop a sense of belonging and are able to contribute to their community  socially and economically.

 ‘Today’s meeting shows that the Australian Government is listening to the concerns of the settlement agencies and the  diverse communities they assist,’ Minister McGauran said.

 This year, the Canterbury Bankstown Migrant Resource Centre has received more than half a million dollars in core  funding and grants from the Australian Government to further improve settlement services.

 ‘The Australian Government is always looking for better ways to help new arrivals settle into their new community,’  Minister McGauran said.
