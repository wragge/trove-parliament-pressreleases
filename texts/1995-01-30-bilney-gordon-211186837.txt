 RELIEF AID FOR M O ZA M BIQ U E

 Australia will provide an assistance package totalling around $6.5 million for refugee and relief  activities in Mozambique, the Minister for Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney, said today.

 "Following the General Peace Agreement in October 1992 and the recent elections in Mozambique, the  country is slowly beginning a process of renewal after a 16 year civil war and a devastating drought, "  Mr Bilney said. "There is now cautious optimism about the country's future. All but 100,000 of its 1.7  million refugees have returned home to relative peace."

 "However it is unavoidable that there will be setbacks along the way - a poor harvest in 1994 has  necessitated relief operations for around 1.5 million people in need of emergency food supplies."

 The challenge for Mozambique and the international community is to maintain peace and to  successfully reintegrate refugees, displaced people and demobilised soldiers. To achieve this it is vital  to re-establish basic services as the foundation for sustainable longer-term rehabilitation and  development.

 Mr Bilney said the Australian assistance package would support the reintegration and rehabilitation  programs of United Nations agencies and Australian NGOs.

 The largest grant of $2.9 million will be made to World Vision Australia for its relief and  rehabilitation programs including the provision of food aid, seeds and tools for agricultural recovery  and primary health programs.

 Grants to other Australian NGOs include $166,000 to Community Aid Abroad to distribute seeds and  tools, and $500,000 to AUSTCARE to provide clothing to Mozambican refugees in Malawi.

 The World Food Programme will receive $2 million to purchase food for distribution to returning  refugees and displaced people.

 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will receive $1 million for the distribution of  food, seeds, tools and rehabilitation of basic services in the water, health and education sectors.
