 ‘ Jrnlst *

 Dr Hews on, first on immigration, can I take it from your  comments in recent months that you'd accept Mr Hand's figure  of 31,000 as a proposed cut in the intake for next year?

 No, I think it's a fiction. I don't think they're really  serious about cutting immigration intake because they've, by  slight of hand, also re-confirmed the Hawke decision on  Chinese students,  and that's about 30,000 Chinese students 

 that have been given special entry. So they cut it with one  hand and put it back with the other.

 You can be sure that there's only party that will seriously  cut immigration in Australia, and that's the Coalition  Parties,  because we face the reality of the fact that in a  recession we don't have the capacity to absorb migrants.   Equally, in a recession, a lot of migrants don't want to come  here.  It doesn't do them any good to end up on the 

 unemployment rolls as we've seen in recent days - some 40-odd  percent of the recently arrived migrants have ended up on some  sort of Government benefit.  Many of those are low-skilled,  low English-speaking migrants,  and I think you've got to 

 change the whole operation of immigration. You've got to put,  I think, much greater weight on skills, much greater weight on  the English language than the Government is even doing in this  decision, and significantly cut it by tens of thousands more.

 Jrnlst:

 What about refugees and family reunion?

 Hewson:

 Well refugees ...we've said that we thought the cuts should be  across the board, but we've put refugees to one side. Right  now, I guess we've got about 23,000 cases that are

 Hewson:

 undetermined, and that shows what a shambles that whole  process is., that you've got 23,000 people waiting to have  their status determined.  We have had a very good record in  taking refugees,  to humanitarian considerations in relation to 

 immigration, and we would keep that going as a process.  We've  said we'd put more resources into it and accelerate it,  because I don't think it's too good to leave these people  sitting around as long as they have been with their status  undetermined.

 But apart from that, I think there have got to be cuts across  the board.  And what you're going to end up with under the  Hand proposal, as I understand it, is roughly 50% of our  migrant intake is going to be family reunion - where we have 

 really got to give much greater weight to skills and to labour  market considerations in Australia.

 Jrnlst:

 Specifically in terms of giving more weight to skills, what  would you do?

 Hewson:

 Well, you can change the nature of the tests,  if you like.  You can give more weight to the English language.  And we're  looking at actually upgrading that whole process quite  considerably. And in fact we've also said that we're looking 

 at giving the whole idea of citizenship much greater weight in  Australia - looking for people to make a much more significant  contribution, or commitment I should say, to Australia first 

 and as part of the immigration process.

 So we will be making more statements in the next few weeks and  months about the nature of the immigration program we think is  appropriate for Australia. But you can be sure that we will  cut it genuinely and generally, unlike the Government which is 

 pretty much a fiction. They're just trying to neutralise the  issue and talk about cuts when in fact they aren't really  cutting at all.

 Jrnlst:

 Well,  if a Hewson Cabinet was in Canberra today, what figure  would you come out with?

 â   Hewson:

 We've resisted the temptation to put a specific target until  we've completed the process, and we're not sure that targets  make much sense, because the Government's adhered to targets  over the last 70 years only to blow those targets every year.

 VR E F : TRANSCR\NM\S 0086 3.

 Secondly, we've said that in circumstances like this in the  past - recessions in the past - the net immigration intake has  fallen to somewhere between 50 and 75,000. Now this is a much  worse recession, if you like, than what we've had in the past, 

 and that's another consideration we've been taking into  account in determining our approach.

 But I think you need to step back and take a completely 

 different approach, because they've made a mockery of  immigration over the last several years.  They've set targets  and failed to achieve them. There's enormous evidence around  now of abuse of that process.  Much too little weight on the 

 skills component, and not enough weight on looking at the  ,  labour market situation in Australia, the opportunities for  work in Australia.

 The simple rule is, if they aim to cut it to about 80,000,  which I think is still about 100,000, that's about 100,000  jobs that won't be filled by people who are already here.  We've got a million unemployed.  We've got to take a much 

 harder line on immigration.

 Jrnlst:

 Just finally, what about those Chinese students you referred  to? What would you do with them?

 Hewsoni

 We've said consistently from the beginning - and that is, the  day that the Hawke Government made that decision - that they  shouldn't be treated any differently to any other group that  are claiming to be refugees. They should be put through the  process, the DORS procedure, to determine whether they are in 

 fact genuine refugees.

 It was just a rush of emotion on the part Bob Hawke in the  aftermath of Tiananmen Square that he said "Look, we ought to  have a special category of Chinese students" which then in  turn gives them family reunion rights - and we're looking at  present at something like 35,000 that have come through in a 

 special category. Well, if you're going to have an 

 immigration program, and you're going to maintain the  integrity of that program, unless those people qualify through  the normal procedure, or unless, in their particular case,  they qualify as genuine refugees, then they shouldn't be given 

 special treatment. And that's been our position from the  beginning.

 So what you've had quietly in recent days is Mr Keating  re-confirm that Chinese student decision in a letter to the  editor of a Chinese newspaper - and didn't have the guts to  announce it publicly - which he, in effect, will allow 

 30-35,000 more on that basis - and then he had Gerry Hand come

 out in front and say "we're going to cut by about 30,000" - no  net change.

 That's just a farce. They're trying to neutralise a political  issue rather than deal with the problem.

 Jrnlst!

 Dr Hewson, how damaging do you see the Terry Metherall/ICAC  Inquiry being to the Greiner Government, and in turn perhaps  to your chance at the election?

 Hewson:

 I've consistently stayed away from commenting on the Metherall  situation in New South Wales and the way that Nick Greiner has  handled it. I don't think it does Nick any good or me any  good for me to comment on that. Equally, Nick doesn't get 

 involved in Federal politics and Federal political issues  either.

 There's no doubt though, that our standing in the polls has  deteriorated dramatically in New South Wales, and to some  extent that's influenced by State factors as well as Federal  factors. And it's been a factor in our consideration of  electoral strategy of course, and about the amount of work  we've got to do in New South Wales to focus attention back on 

 us, if you like, and back on Federal issues. There's a daily  focus on the Metherall issue and other State issues which,  quite often, in a polling sense, get confused with a Federal  issue and a Federal stand.

 I think that that problem, in a sense, will solve itself in  due course, and our electoral stocks will come back. So we  are not doing anything in particular in relation to it, but I  just point out that it has been a factor in our relative poll  performance. we've maintained a very substantial lead in  other States.  That lead has evaporated in New South Wales 

 and...

 Jrnlst:

 Is it part of your reason for being here today?

 ,  Hewson:

 No, we've been trying to get around and see as many projects  and activities firsthand as we can. We, in this case, are  very strong supporters of the privatisation of our 

 infrastructure. We will be saying a lot more in the next few  months about, on a national basis, a national program for  infrastructure reform, and a lot more focus on the private  role that can be played in terms of ownership and management 

 of a lot of that infrastructure.

 ,  .REF: TRANSCR-\NM\S0086 5.

 This is a very good example of a road that... I personally  remember, when I was 10 years old, my father bought a house in  Welfare Avenue,  Beverly Hills,  and he was told at that time  "Don't buy the house.  There's a road about to go through the  middle of Welfare Avenue, and you'll lose the money you put 

 into the house."

 Well, here we are 35 years later and the soil's finally been  broken. Dad sold the house about 15 years ago - did quite  nicely out of it, and it just makes mockery of the whole  process.  This roadlink has been debated for something like 44  â¢  years, I think - since 1948. It's finally being built. It 

 has to be built by the private sector and private sector  money, and I think it's very good that it is, and I think  that's an important trend. And it doesn't force people to use  it, but it provides people with a choice.  If you want to have 

 a quick passage along here out to Liverpool, you take the  private tollway; if you don't, you stick with the existing  roads.

 I think there's tremendous potential in a city like Sydney for  that sort of development, as there is right around Australia.  I think people who come here from overseas are amazed that we  have such a poorly developed infrastructure in a city as large 

 as Sydney. Great highways that come in at Liverpool and  Penrith and Hornsby, but no way of getting the traffic from  the centre of the city out, or around the city. That's what's  so important now - that we've got to face the reality of some  of these infrastructure needs, and we've got to look at the 

 roll that the private sector can play.

 Leighton Holdings here have done a fantastic job, and I think,  as I'm today, this road will be opened by September of this  year, and I think it was scheduled to be opened originally in  February of 1995, So it shows you that they can do it. They 

 can do it quicker, and they can provide a real alternative to  the existing congested road. And as I've used this route from  the city out to Liverpool many times in a private capacity, I  can hardly wait to make this trip in about 10 minutes rather  than 45.

 Ends.
