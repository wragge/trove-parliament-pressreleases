 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 12 November 2014   

 Refugees hit by data breach need protection   

 Following the release of the Privacy Commissioner’s report into an incident, where the personal  details of thousands of refugees was exposed by the Immigration Department, the government must  take action to guarantee the safety of those involved, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “The damage has been done and now the government has to explain how it will keep these people  safe,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “It is extremely concerning that the Immigration Department has failed to explain what it is doing to  lessen the fallout from their failure.   

 “The fact that these people have been exposed to harm because of this breach must be factored in  to the processing of their claims for protection.   

 “Improperly handling anyone’s private information is always serious but, because these people were  seeking asylum, this breach has possibly put thousands of lives at risk. It has also exposed the  Australian tax payer to millions of dollars in potential damages.   

 “Those affected may well deserve significant compensation, but what they need more is safety.   

 “I urge the government to clean up their mess properly, once and for all.”
