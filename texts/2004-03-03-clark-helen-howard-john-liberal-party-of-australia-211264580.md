 PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:   

 Well morning ladies and gentlemen. I’m delighted again to welcome the Prime Minister of  New Zealand to Australia. The relationship between our two countries remains very close and  in the time that I’ve been Prime Minister and particularly in the time that Helen and I have  shared our respective positions, or occupied our respective positions, we’ve maintained the  practice of bilateral visits each year, I was in New Zealand last year for a bilateral visit, and  I’m delighted to have Helen Clark here in Canberra today.   

 I’d like to start this news conference by congratulating New Zealand on the clean sweep of  the Academy Awards, there’s a saying in our language that something’s bigger than Ben Hur,  this was bigger than Ben Hur and it was an extraordinary achievement and I know has bought  a lot of satisfaction to New Zealanders, not only in New Zealand but around the world.   

 On a more sombre note I’d like to express the concern of the Australian Government and the  Australian people of the Government and people of New Zealand for the very severe floods  that have been experienced and during our discussions I indicated that if there was any  assistance of any kind that the Australian Government could offer in relation to flood relief  and mitigation we would be very ready to do so.   

 Our relationship has many strands to it, ties of history and of ethnicity and shared values and  shared approaches to many of the world’s challenges. We, looking at the relationship in a  modern context, we are particularly keen at a prime ministerial level to maintain the  momentum towards the development of a single economic market comprising Australia and  New Zealand.  We are already a long way down that path and recently the New Zealand  Finance Minister, Dr Cullen, and the Australian Treasurer Mr Costello met and explored 

 www.pm.gov.au 

 

 further ways, particularly in the areas of competition where this goal could be further  advanced and the Prime Minister and I give very strong support to that.     

 We are also continuing to make common cause in relation to world trade reform. It’s difficult,  the intransigence of the larger trading blocs, particularly the European Union and the apparent  reluctance of other big agricultural subsidisers, the Americans and the Japanese in this area,  means that we have to work harder through the Cairns group to revive Doha and to keep it  very much on track. But both of us remain very, very committed to that.   

 We took the opportunity of discussing developments in the Pacific, we welcomed the  progress being made with the eminent persons group that was established at the last Pacific  Forum Meeting in New Zealand and I hope that we will be able to arrange at the initiative of  the New Zealand Prime Minister a brief meeting of forum leaders in New Zealand which I’d  be very happy to attend to deal with that particular report.   

 But I’ve said before that I believe we’ve entered a new era as far as Pacific co-operation is  concerned and that is evidenced by the tremendous progress we made in the Solomon Islands,  quite outstanding and it’s an example of Pacific co-operation, it’s not an example of big  brother activity by Australia or New Zealand of working together with our friends and it’s a  metaphor in a way or a template for what can be achieved in the future working together.   

 But can I again Prime Minister welcome you to Australia, and renew my personal  commitment to the strongest possible bilateral relationship between the Anzacs.   

 PRIME MINISTER CLARK:   

 Well thank you John and you’ve given a full summary of the issues which we’ve discussed  today. This has been the fifth formal bilateral we’ve had since I became Prime Minister, but I  would say over the past four years and three months we’ve probably met somewhere by 20,  25 to 30 times. We are on a circuit with many prominent and national associations which see  us talking frequently and that is undoubtedly one of the many reasons why we don’t meet  today with anything controversial on the agenda, but really a shared agenda in a lot of areas,  both bilaterally on economic developments and also around our region.     

 We have been very supportive of the work being done by the Australian Treasurer and New  Zealand Minister of Finance on developing the single economic market. It’s clear that our  relationship has now gone way beyond a Free Trade Agreement into single economic market  issues and the work programme that the Treasurer and the Minister of Finance from New  Zealand have set out on banking supervision, on competition law is one which takes us  further along that road to the single economic market.  We’re very supportive of that.    

 Obviously we’ve spent quite a bit of time on the trade issues today, the Cairns Group meeting  which Mark Vaile was at with Jim Sutton just last week I think has put some new impetus in  that group’s advocacy for the WTO round.  We each have our own FTA priorities running  and I congratulate you again on your success, particularly in the presidential election year in  the US with the agreement with that great economy.  We are working on the Thai FTA at the  moment, we’re making good progress as I know you are in talks with China, we are both very  openly and outwardly orientated and see the benefit of our economies which are go ahead and  growing being linked to other economies which have a lot to offer.   

 The discussion on the Pacific has been particularly useful, New Zealand has been facilitating  the eminent persons group review of the Pacific Island Forum, launched last August when we 

  2

 met in Auckland. It is coming together very, very well to the extent that I believe that to keep  the momentum up it will be important to bring the leaders together in the coming weeks so  that we launch the Secretary General and his people in Suva on a number of important  projects to have them well under way by the time we get to APIA in August. So we will be  making best endeavours to get a day for that retreat.     

 We’ve also discussed the success of the Solomon Islands operation. I know that Australia is  on a track to be there until July and we will want to be there with you and then to continue to  see the broader aspects of the Solomons project through.   

 So it’s been a good and substantive discussion, we’ll carry on over lunch, but it’s a pleasure  to be back in Canberra again for the talks.   

 PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:   

 Thank you. Questions?   

 JOURNALIST:   

 … Mr Howard’s offer of any flood assistance and number two did you discuss the Free Trade  Agreement that Australia has with the US and are you seeking Australia’s support in helping  lobby for a New Zealand deal with the US?   

 PRIME MINISTER CLARK:   

 On the floods John Howard conveyed as he has again now Australia’s sympathy for the  damage which has been done.  We have our recovery plans now going into operation, so we  haven’t asked for assistance.  But I know the Trans Tasman spirit is such that if there was any  need it would come right away just as we’ve responded in the past with the appalling fires  that Australia’s had by sending firefighters.    

 Secondly on the US FTA, our Trade Minister was in the United States last week talking with  the trade representative.  New Zealand is continuing to lobby and build its constituency in  Washington and among the business community and obviously it’s our aspiration that where  Australia has gone, New Zealand will in time follow.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 On the Free Trade Agreement, Mrs Clark, Australia’s made concessions to the US on its  foreign investment stream rules .  Does New Zealand take the view that those concessions  under CER should now be extended automatically to New Zealand?   

 PRIME MINISTER CLARK:   

 I don’t come with an opinion on that.  It is, of course, the case that the full text of the FTA  isn’t yet out so people haven’t been able to analyse it in great detail.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Howard, on that full text of the FTA - are you expecting it to be released today?  And if  not, what are the technical problems that are holding it up?   

  3

 PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:   

 I don’t know whether it will be released today or not.  But they are as Mr Vaile has described  them.  And, I mean, let’s preserve a sense of proportion - whether it’s out today or tomorrow  or Friday is hardly going to matter in the great scheme of things.  It hasn’t altered the fact that  we have negotiated an agreement and it will be out shortly, it may be today, it may be in the  next day or two, but it’s not going to alter anything.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Just on the issue of unauthorised boat arrivals and New Zealand willing to take some of the  case load from Nauru and can I ask Mr Howard whether you’re attracted to a proposition to  (inaudible)... the changed migration zone from the mainland from the low to the high water  mark?   

 PRIME MINISTER CLARK:   

 Well, as you would be aware, New Zealand has endeavoured to assist Australia to resolve  these very difficult problems and we will continue to endeavour to do that and to respond to  any request that the UN high commissioner for refugees makes.  We know there are various  re-evaluations going on at the moment and it’s really a matter now of what the outcome of  those is.   

 PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:   

 Could I just say on that issue that I am very appreciative of the helpful and constructive and  understanding attitude that New Zealand has taken over a number of years in relation to this  issue and I’ve had occasion in the past to express my thanks to the Prime Minister for that and  I do it again this morning. You asked me a question, I think, about the high and low water  marks and the migration zone.  There’s no proposal in front of the Cabinet or the Government  in relation to that.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Howard, on the wake of this opinion poll it puts Labor well ahead.  Does that correspond  with your assessment on [inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:   

 Well, there was a poll last week that told a somewhat different picture.  I’m not going to  comment on each of them.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible] issue, a TV3 poll out tonight shows a ten per cent increase for support for the  national Opposition.  Are you concerned that they have all the [inaudible] right now?   

 PRIME MINISTER CLARK:   

 No, as I’ve said on many occasions, there was a speech around the single issue timed in the  run up to the annual silly season around Waitangi and that gained some momentum. I’ve also 

  4

 acknowledged that there’s a lot of genuine Kiwis who have raised various concerns and the  Government is listening and endeavouring to address them.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Do you feel like you have something in common with Mr Howard, both Prime Ministers for a  long time, both face some serious threats right now?   

 PRIME MINISTER CLARK:   

 Well, I’ve always felt that John Howard and myself undergone a long apprenticeship to get to  the positions that we got to and I think we identify in each other a characteristic of battling to  get to the top and then working hard to stay there.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:   

 I beg your pardon?   

 JOURNALIST:   

 What’s the economic [inaudible] RBA’s decision to leave rates unchanged?   

 PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:   

 Well, I don’t know that I will try and read the mind of the Governor or the mind of the board.  It’s a decision that I note and I’m sure will be welcomed by home borrowers, particularly.  It  indicates the continuing stability of the Australian economy.  But I don’t think we should get  too hung up for momentous comments on each tiny movement in rates either way or non-movement.  I think that’s blowing these monthly things out of all proportion.  The  fundamentals of the Australian economy sustain and validate a low interest rate structure, but  the question of tiny movements either way at particular times ought not to be the subject of  endless economic seminars.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [inaudible] on Iraq.  In the new inquiry which you have agreed to, will you allow that inquiry  to examine suggestions of possible political pressure on intelligence agencies and also  government exaggeration of views of Australian intelligence agencies that arise from the joint  parliamentary committee report?   

 PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:   

 Well, the terms of reference will reflect the recommendation of the committee.  We are doing  exactly what the bipartisan committee recommended.  The committee that is chaired by  David Jull of the Liberal Party and included the two most credible figures on intelligence and  defence matters in the Australian Labor Party, Robert Ray and Kim Beazley.  And we’ll  exactly follow what that committee has recommended.  I think that’s the right thing to do, it’s  the decent thing to do and it’s the thing we’re going to do. 

  5

 

 JOURNALIST:   

 Anti-terror laws, have you been forced to water down the initial power…?   

 PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:   

 No, I would have thought the Labor Party had been forced into a back flip. I notice it’s called  a concession, an adjustment. It’s in reality a big back flip because they’ve railed against it as a  terrible infringement of civil liberties and now for, you know, some reasons of political  judgement and not high principle they have executed a back flip.  And I congratulate them on  it, I think it’s the right thing to have done in the national interest.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [inaudible] Government have to office some safeguards for Labor to support it, for example  the state and territory leaders…   

 PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:   

 The Government has maintained the essentials of what we’ve put. I mean, what’s happened is  that Labor’s said it would never accept a situation where the executive government could  proscribe an organisation whether explicit parliamentary authority through legislation - that  was their position and they said it was wrong in principle that that power be given to the  Attorney General of the day, they’ve now accepted it.    

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Howard, just on Pacific issues, are you… did you discuss this Ms Clark the issue of PNG,  particularly?  And is Australia looking for New Zealand to do more of the heavy lifting in  terms of Pacific affairs?   

 PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:   

 Well, the short answer is yes, no.  We did discuss the issue. I talked in some detail about what  we were doing in Papua New Guinea.  But we’re not looking to New Zealand for assistance.   We accept that there is a particular bilateral link between Australia and Papua New Guinea  and there are particular Australian responsibilities that don’t derive from our common Pacific  orientation but they are borne out of history and the association between the two countries.   So, of course, we discussed it, but no, I’ve not asked and I will not be asking New Zealand for  assistance.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 You’re satisfied with the role that Australia is playing in the Pacific?  I mean, there have been  concerns continued to be raised that Australia’s been, I guess too assertive.  Does New  Zealand share any of those concerns?     

 PRIME MINISTER CLARK:   

 No it doesn’t, we’re delighted that Australia is taking an increasing interest in the Pacific and  is prioritising the relationship and I think that will be beneficial for the Pacific.

 JOURNALIST:   

 Prime Minister Clark, there are reports this morning that New Zealand is close to becoming  the first developed country to finalise a Free Trade deal with China, can you comment on  those reports?   

 PRIME MINISTER CLARK:   

 I think the reports are running a bit ahead of things, it’s impossible to say that any one  country will be the first to strike a deal because China will be talking with a lot of players and  you cannot asses at what rate talks will go with individual countries or groupings of countries  but what I can say is we’re very happy with the progress we’re making in discussions with  China, you’ll recall that in October last year Australia and China were able to make rapid  progress on a trade and economic framework agreement which has seen us laying the basis  then for FTA negotiations and New Zealand has been working to the same end.   

 PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:   

 One more, then we’ve got to go, the Prime Minister’s got other commitments.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Are you concerned about Wilson Tuckey’s comments that he made regarding Graham  Edwards and are going to speak to him or your office going to speak to him or have you  spoken to him about those comments?   

 PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:   

 Well I was asked something yesterday about this and I made well, I want to make it very  plain that the views I expressed yesterday I adhere to very strongly and I think any criticism  of Graham Edwards in any way in relation to his war service or the entitlements deriving  from it is completely unacceptable and will be seen by the Australian public as such. That  doesn’t mean to say that colleagues don’t have a right to engage in legitimate and vigorous  debate but let’s face it, the man paid a terrible price for his war service, Australians  understand that, I understand that, and all of my colleagues understand that as well.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 … effectively declared Mark Latham’s honeymoon over, do you think your backbench will  be doubting that today?   

 PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:   

 Well I don’t talk about what was said in the Party Room.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 … may I have a question?  You may be aware that there’s a debate here in Australia about  Australia’s involvement in the war in Iraq and yesterday in the Parliament the  Australian/American alliance was evoked is a factor in decision making process here in 

  7

  8

 Australia.  Does the ANZUS alliance still have any vestige of authority as far as you’re  regarded and why did you not go to war?   

 PRIME MINISTER CLARK:   

 The answer to the latter question has been stated many times and I’ll restate it for the record;  the position of the New Zealand Government was that the diplomatic and inspection process  had not run its course and that was what we based on our decision on, nothing else. 

 

 PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:   

 Thank you.
