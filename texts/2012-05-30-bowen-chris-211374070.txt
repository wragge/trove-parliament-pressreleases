 ANOTHER BOAT DUE TO TONY ABBOTT’S RELENTLESS  NEGATIVITY   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare MP, today said the latest boat is the 39th intercepted since Tony Abbott  rejected the Government’s offer to work together to implement both parties’ policy of  offshore processing.   

 “As the Government has said countless times, without a genuine deterrent such as the  Malaysia Arrangement boats will continue arrive. But without legislation, there is no legal  basis for offshore processing, whether it be in Malaysia or Nauru,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “The only thing encouraging people onto dangerous boat journeys is Tony Abbott’s  negativity in his refusal to support the Government’s offshore processing legislation.”   

 Mr Clare said it was time for Mr Abbott to stop saying no.   

 “Working together we can help stop people dying at sea. We can pass legislation to  introduce offshore processing,” Mr Clare said.   

 “If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must stop saying no and pass our  legislation to allow asylum seekers to be processed offshore in Malaysia and Nauru.”
