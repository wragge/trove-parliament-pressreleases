 Australian Greens Media Release   

 Friday, 12 October 2012   

 Ineffectual offshore farce panned by UNHCR   

 Experts and advocacy groups have been lining up to criticise different aspects of the  Government’s offshore processing regime in recent days, but the tragic effect it is having on  refugees will continue as long as Minister Bowen chooses to ignore their advice, the Australian  Greens say.   

 “The day after the UNHCR slammed the Government’s designation of PNG as a regional  processing country, we have heard of a suicide attempt by an Iranian refugee at the inadequate  Nauru detention centre,” Greens spokesperson for immigration Senator Sarah-Hanson Young  said.   

 "The experts warned this would happen, the Greens warned this would happen, but the  Immigration Department and Minster Bowen carried on anyway.   

 “I hope they are taking a long hard look at this half-baked, inhumane and ineffectual policy and  deciding to pull out of the PNG facility while they still can.   

 “Antonio Guterres from the UNHCR has strongly criticised the situation on PNG in a detailed  four page letter sent directly to Minister Bowen in which he also exposed the so called ‘no  advantage’ policy for the empty  catchphrase that it is.   

 “The letter has revealed just how inadequate the situation on PNG is, where there isn’t even  one person with the relevant experience and training that is required to process refugees.   

 “Desperate and vulnerable people are still doing whatever they can to seek asylum and that  obviously won’t change until we give them safer pathways.   

 “The continued use of offshore, indefinite detention will push people, including children, to  desperate acts such as self-harm, as we saw occur under John Howard’s Pacific Solution.   

 “The Australian values of a fair go mean that we must listen to the experts, such as the UNHCR  and mental health professionals.”
