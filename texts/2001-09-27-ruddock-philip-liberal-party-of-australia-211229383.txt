 Minister asks Canberra about Managing Migration

 MPS 166/2001

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, will ask residents of Canberra their views on the size and composition of the 2002-2003 Australian migration and humanitarian programs today.

 "The consultations will give residents of Canberra the opportunity to have their say on Australia's migrant intake for the coming financial year," Mr Ruddock said.

 "I look forward to meeting with people to hear their views. I particularly look forward to discussing Canberra's intake of skilled migrants," he said.

 The Australian Capital Territory, and the surrounding region, attracts a significant number of skilled migrants under the State/Territory specific and regional migration initiatives.

 These initiatives include the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme (RSMS) where a regional employer who can not fill the position from the local labour market sponsors the migrant.

 "In 2000-01, more than 200 skilled migrants came to Canberra and the surrounding regions under these initiatives," Mr Ruddock said.

 The Minister launched his annual consultations in Sydney early this month and will hold meetings with State, Territory and local governments, business and industry groups, unions, environmental bodies, welfare organisations, refugee agencies, and representatives of Australia's migrant communities.

 The consultation process includes:

 a discussion paper raising issues on the size and composition of Australia's Migration and Humanitarian Programs; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 a range of public meetings in capital cities and regional centres including Ballina, âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Kalgoorlie, Townsville, Launceston and Mt Gambier;

 written submissions from the Australian community; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 ·discussion on migration issues on an on-line discussion forum. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 "The meetings provide an ideal forum for all Australians to contribute their ideas and provides the Government with community views on issues regarding refugee resettlement and other humanitarian and general migration issues," Mr Ruddock said.
