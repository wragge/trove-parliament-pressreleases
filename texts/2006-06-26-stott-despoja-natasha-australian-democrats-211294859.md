 Indonesia Pact Needs Mutual Respect

 Any Security Pact between Australia and Indonesia must incorporate full security considerations of both  countries and not be simply a one-sided affair, according to the Australian Democrats.   

 "The Australian Government wants to be seen to be responsive to Indonesian security concerns,  especially over West Papuan asylum seekers," Democrats Foreign Affairs Spokesperson, Senator  Natasha Stott Despoja said.   

 "However, this must be balanced with the Indonesian Government seriously acknowledging Australian  concerns over the release of terrorist suspect Abu Bakr Bashir a man who was charged with conspiracy  over the 2002 Bali bombing where 88 Australians lost their lives.    

 "Any relationship between countries needs to be based on some level of mutual understanding and  compromise.   

 "We call on the Australian Government not to enter into any negotiations with the Indonesian  Government unless we can be assured that Indonesia can respect Australias ongoing concerns with Abu  Bakr Bashir, as well as with the group Jemaah Islamiyah.    

 "We also would like confirmation that the Indonesian Government will attempt to address Australias  concerns on human rights in Indonesia, as human security is a key component of any long-term national  security architecture." Senator Stott Despoja said.
