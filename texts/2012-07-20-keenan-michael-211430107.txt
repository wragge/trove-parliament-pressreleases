 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling PEOPLE SMUGGLERS’ TWICE DAILY  SERVICE CONTINUES TO DELIVER RECORD  NUMBERS July 20, 2012

 The People Smugglers twice daily service to Australia has delivered 509 asylum seekers on 10 illegal boats this week,  Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border  Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "Despite the increased traffic and increased risk of harm, Labor, the Greens and the advocates are refusing to  acknowledge that their calls over many years to weaken our border protection regime, close Nauru, abolish Temporary  Protection Visas and release asylum seekers into the community has led to this crisis. Yet their response is to call for  further softening of policies and to throw the door off its hinges. 

 "The outsourcing of policy to an expert panel, no matter how eminent, represents a complete failure of leadership on the  part of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration. The Minister has already indicated that he may not even listen  to them or accept their recommendations revealing that the expert panel is nothing but a smokescreen to their chronic  indecision," Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr Keenan said: "So far this week Border Protection Command hasn’t gone more than 24 hours without another illegal  boat arrival - stretching their already limited resources to beyond breaking point. 

 "This is the 10th boat arrival since Sunday and there is no sign of this unprecedented influx slowing any time soon. 

 "Whilst these record numbers continue to flood our borders, the Labor Government continues to do nothing but talk - offering no viable solution to this crisis of their own making," Mr Keenan said.
