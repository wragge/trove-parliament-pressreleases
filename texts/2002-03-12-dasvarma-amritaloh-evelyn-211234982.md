 Intersectional Discrimination Paper prepared by Amrita Dasvarma & Evelyn Loh

 Paper presented by Amrita Dasvarma

 Background

 The Women's Rights Action Network Australia (WRANA) has been working on a Gender and Racism project since October 2000 as part of its preparations for the United Nations World Conference Against Racism, held in Durban, South Africa, September 1- 7, 2001. The project aims to highlight issues of discrimination at the intersection of racism and sexism as experienced by women in Australia.

 In the lead up to the World Conference Against Racism (WCAR), WRANA members worked voluntarily with other organisations and interested individuals, to create a space for issues of intersectional discrimination to be raised and discussed. Using data collected from women through public consultations, submissions and existing research in the area, WRANA produced a report depicting intersectional discrimination issues in Australia. The following paper is based in part on this report.

 WRANA has planned a second phase to the gender and racism project as a follow-up to the WCAR the production of a Gender and Racism Kit, to develop practical strategies for women's organisations to address issues of sex / race intersectional discrimination. It is envisioned that the Kit will be used by a diverse range women's organisations across Australia to define and apply race and gender intersectionality in the Australian context. Materials for the Kit are being developed using both international and domestic resources.

 What is intersectional discrimination?

 At its simplest, intersectional discrimination means recognizing that a person may be subject to discrimination based on several aspects of their identity. In the case of women, it means that the way in which women experience life in Australia differs according to a variety of factors, including gender, race, class, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, age, language, and religious beliefs. As each of these are common avenues of discrimination in our society, women may experience discrimination via one or more of these avenues.

 Discrimination is not just one isolated category; it can be many categories all at the same time

 HREOC Website: Racial Discrimination - Beyond Tolerance

 Very often it is some or all of these factors together that contribute to a human rights violation. Discrimination on any one of these grounds can violate a person's human rights, and in any instance of discrimination, a range of factors could be at work to influence a person to commit an act of discrimination. This combination of specific or single causes of discrimination - such as race and gender for example - is called 'intersectional discrimination'. [1]

 The United Nations, in its preparations for the World Conference Against Racism held in September 2001 in Durban, South Africa, used the analogy of a traffic intersection to illustrate the meaning of intersectional discrimination:

 To use a metaphor of an intersection, we first analogize the various axes of power, for instance, race, ethnicity, gender and class, as constituting the thoroughfares which structure the social, economic, or political terrain. Racialised women are often positioned in the space where racism or xenophobia, class and gender meet. They are consequently subject to injury by the heavy flow of traffic along these roads.

 Although our identity cannot be defined as only one thing - for example, our gender - the human rights system to date has formally recognised discrimination on the basis of only one factor at a time, rather than a combination of several factors at the same time. [2]

 Example: The United Nations Convention Eliminating All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), also known as the 'Women's Convention', does recognise that other forms of discrimination exist, but is generally perceived to deal primarily with gender discrimination. Similarly, the Convention Eliminating Racial Discrimination (CERD) addresses discrimination based on race and, most often, racism experiencedin the public arena, usually dominated by men, rather than all forms of racism experienced by men and women.

 Why does this matter?

 The historical way of dealing with discrimination one factor at a time has important implications in practice, as aspects of our identities such as gender, ethnicity, sexuality and age, cannot be neatly divided. In order to fit this segregated system of human rights, women who experience discrimination based on multiple factors must inevitably fragment their identities as human rights violations based on both their gender and their race, remain invisible and cannot be named.

 Example: The 'trafficking in women', which has always been defined as a gender issue, ignores the race aspects of trafficking. This interpretation then loses sight of which women are most at risk, and what their treatment may be in their host countries because of their race. Women are most often trafficked from a poorer country to a wealthier one. The Asia Pacific region has been identified as a major site of trafficking in women, which means that most of the women who become part of this irregular and informal migration are of Southeast Asian or Pacific/Melanesian descent, and many end up in Australia.

 The ramifications of this practice of fragmenting identities can be further highlighted through the analogy of the "traffic intersection". We are all unique, so we all stand at unique intersections created by different avenues of discrimination intersecting, although there are of course similarities between groups of women. At each intersection, each woman is uniquely vulnerable. It is important not only to understand the nature of each strand of discrimination, but also the consequences of the combination of these different strands. What is the effect upon each woman of these forms of discrimination colliding? For some women, the effects are devastating: for example, for a Muslim Afghan asylum-seeker woman who travels to Australia with the assistance of people smugglers, the various discriminations based on her lack of legal status in Australia, her poor English skills, her gender, her nationality and her religious beliefs can all combine to result in very specific and very traumatic experiences of prejudice and inequity.

 Some progress has been made

 In recent years there has been some recognition of the limited nature of how human rights has been defined and explained. The need to recognise and prioritise the complexity of how different strands of discrimination can interact with each other ('intersectional discrimination' or more commonly, 'intersectionality') has been emphasised by minority women's rights advocates in particular. There has since been a growing understanding of the ramifications of 'racialisation' upon women. Racialisation is linked to a growing discussion of 'whiteness' as a culture and an ethnicity. In Australian society, where being white is the 'norm', terms such as Culturally and Linguistically Diverse, Non-English Speaking Background, and ethnic minority, are used to refer to women who do not fit this 'norm' consequently ignoring that white people also have a culture that is different from others in the community. In this sense, the term 'racialised' means that a woman's identity has been shaped by her race, and that her colour, ethnicity, cultural and religious background has been a dominant component in how the general community perceives her.

 http://www.humanrights.gov.au/racial_discrimination/beyond_tolerance/speeches/dasvarma.html (2 of 10) [21/05/2002 1:25:46]

 Increasingly, intersectionality has and is being recognised by international human rights institutions and bodies, and this particularly highlighted at the UN World Conference Against Racism in September 2001.

 Types of intersectionality

 The UN Expert Group Meeting on Gender and Race Discrimination held in Croatia in 2000, identified three distinct types of intersectional discrimination:

 targeted discrimination, where discrimination results from abuses specifically targeted at women of a particular race

 Example: The threats of rape targeting Muslim young women in Sydney in August 2001, because of their religious identity.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 compound discrimination, where women are subject to discrimination because of gendered roles, and membership of ethnic and racial groups. Compound discrimination can be subtle therefore few avenues of redress exist.

 Example: In workforces that are gender and race-segregated, racialised women may face discrimination on the basis of their gender (by being excluded from certain jobs, regardless of their skills) and on the basis of their race (again, regardless of their skills).

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 structural intersectional discrimination, which occurs 'where policies intersect with underlying structures to create a compounded burden for particularly vulnerable women.' âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 An Australian Perspective:

 In Australia, international treaties form the basis of the federal anti-discrimination and domestic human rights system. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC), for example, has segregated anti-race and anti-sex discrimination mechanisms. Each is mandated by separate pieces of legislation, and resourced by separate units within the Commission.

 This means that ethnic minority / racialised women and Indigenous women have to compartmentalise their experiences of discrimination and choose one over the other when making claims of discrimination to HREOC.

 The system is not adequate

 That racialised women have to tailor their experiences to suit the segregated system of Australian human rights legislation illustrates the inadequacy of the system to deal with cases of intersectional discrimination. A more flexible, fluid and responsive human rights framework would recognise experiences of cumulative discrimination

 Women are alienated

 Women are generally discouraged from using the anti-discrimination system to protect their rights because they need to they distrust the legal rights regime and have very little access for assistance in understanding or navigating the system.

 To address this, there is an urgent need for more data, and information about the manifestation of intersectional discrimination in Australia. , In an attempt to be more responsive to all diverse communities, there also needs to be research carried out into the ways in which the Australian anti-discrimination system allows intersectional discrimination to occur unchecked.

 Why is this important in Australia?

 In the 1996 census, over 350,000 people identified as Indigenous.

 In June 1999, 24% of people living in Australia were born overseas, 14.2% from non-English speaking background.

 As a nation with a history of Indigenous custodianship, white colonisation, and continuing multi-racial immigration, Australia has a diverse and evolving population. Hence, questions of racism and racial discrimination are very relevant.

 In Australia, women comprise over half of the nation's population. This, combined with the percentage of people who identify as Indigenous and as of Non-English Speaking Background, indicates that the intersections of

 HREOC Website: Racial Discrimination - Beyond Tolerance

 http://www.humanrights.gov.au/racial_discrimination/beyond_tolerance/speeches/dasvarma.html (3 of 10) [21/05/2002 1:25:46]

 sexism and racism affect a significant proportion of the overall population. These experiences of racism and sexism are at the same time unique and similar in that they are compounded by discrimination based on differences of ethnicity, colour, nationality, citizenship status, socio-economic status, cultural and/or linguistic backgrounds, religious and political affiliations, age, ability and sexuality.

 There has been very little available research about the effects of intersectional discrimination in Australia. In part, this is because it is not recognised by the domestic rights system. At the same time, there has been very little will on the part of governments and most research bodies to engage in 'fact-finding' to develop a comprehensive understanding of the combined effects of racism and sexism.

 This absence of information is rendering Indigenous, immigrant, refugee and asylum-seeker women more and more invisible and unaccounted for in program planning and service delivery.

 However, there are statistics and research conducted by academics and non-government organisations that can be used to sketch a picture of intersectional discrimination as experienced by Indigenous, immigrant, refugee and asylum-seeker Australian women.

 Indigenous women's experiences

 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women's experience of racism can be different from that of men in their communities, and their experience of sexism is often different from that of non-Indigenous women.

 Indigenous women's experience of multiple discrimination and disadvantage has its historical roots in colonialism, dispossession and attempted annihilation of Indigenous peoples through assimilationist policies, including the practice of removing children from their families. These atrocities have left a legacy of intergenerational social, mental, physical and economic devastation and poverty.

 Like Indigenous men, Indigenous women experience profound disadvantage in every sphere of their lives - in health, housing, education, employment, social, political, economic, legal and cultural areas. There is a particularly high incidence of women who do not receive linguistically and culturally appropriate services. They are denied a voice and effective participation in many decision-making areas of their lives, particularly in male dominated negotiations over native title rights. Many have lost their lands, their culture and their languages.

 Asylum seeker, immigrant, and refugee women's experiences

 Asylum seeker, immigrant, and refugee women also experience multiple forms of discrimination based on racism, xenophobia and sexism, from a different historical basis. Discrimination against them is often compounded by their complicated immigration or citizenship status, experiences of torture and trauma and, for some, a denial of access to any or some basic services, including an income.

 Women asylum seekers are often vulnerable to sexual or physical abuse during their journey to Australia and sometimes even in Australian immigration detention centres. Lack of citizenship deprives many asylum seeker women of basic economic, social and cultural rights.

 New immigrant, refugee and asylum-seeker women in Australia are denied a basic income because of the application of the two-year waiting period before being allowed to access welfare services. Many do not have recourse to domestic remedies because of their status as non-nationals, leaving them open to extreme exploitation, particularly in sex and employment related areas. For many, poverty, a general lack of sympathy towards asylum-seekers and refugees, racism, xenophobia, sexism, grief and language difficulties, combined with other factors, result in a denial of their basic human rights in Australia.

 Example: Large numbers of immigrant, refugee and asylum-seeker women are forced to work in exploitative home-based work. Conditions are poor, their rates of pay extremely low, instances of chronic injury are commonplace, and their children are involved in this work due to economic necessity. Also, many are denied access to employment in their chosen profession or trade because of barriers to recognising overseas qualifications or racism.

 Immigrant, refugee and asylum-seeker women experience markedly high rates of employment-related illnesses, injuries and disabilities due to their location in the labour market. They experience real constraints in accessing many social resources, namely English classes, social supports, income, housing, transport and child care. The combined impact has been devastating, resulting in poverty, malnutrition, illness, stress and family breakdown for some. Others have been forced into exploitative employment situations, including, in some cases, sex work.

 WRANA project findings

 WRANA's Gender and Racism project which sought information about how women are experiencing

 HREOC Website: Racial Discrimination - Beyond Tolerance

 http://www.humanrights.gov.au/racial_discrimination/beyond_tolerance/speeches/dasvarma.html (4 of 10) [21/05/2002 1:25:46]

 discrimination in Australia, found six major themes arising from women's experiences. These are education, economy, poverty, health, human rights, and institutional mechanisms. These themes also correlate to the UN Beijing Platform for Action, which is considered by some to be one of the most progressive international women's human rights documents. By referring to the Beijing Platform for Action in a discussion about race and gender , we hope to emphasise the need to use a variety of human rights documents and instruments; the need to take an intersectional, multi-layered approach, when addressing intersectional discrimination.

 Women, Racism and Education

 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees everyone a right to an education. But the reality is that:

 Women from certain disadvantaged racial, ethnic, immigrant and Indigenous communities have lower rates of literacy, secondary school attendance and graduation, access to higher education and enrolment in scientific and other training programs

 To remedy this, governments should:

 Advance the goal of equal access to education by taking measures to eliminate discrimination in education at all levels on the basis of gender, race, language, religion, national origin, age, disability; or any other form of discrimination and as appropriate, consider establishing procedures to address grievances.

 Access to education, and recognition of already acquired skills and qualifications, are issues for Indigenous, immigrant, refugee and asylum-seeker women.

 What women said:

 Indigenous history remains virtually invisible in schools. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» At schools, Muslim girls who wear the hijab are bullied and teased. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Girls with strong religious and cultural beliefs are also teased. For example, girls who do not believe in sex before marriage, are labelled 'frigid' by male students of different

 backgrounds, which can lead to fighting between different groups of students.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Migrant and refugee women's prior qualifications are not recognised and they must pass language tests, upgrade qualifications or start from scratch if they want to pursue their chosen careers.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Teaching staff do not respect religious events or festivals and refuse to give extensions because of religious responsibilities, for example, the Muslim Ramadan festival. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 At universities, research methods are often not interrogated sufficiently to see if they are culturally appropriate or culturally offensive. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Specific Indigenous studies courses undertaken have a reputation of being inadequate and inferior, especially if majority of students enrolled in these courses are Indigenous an attitude exists that they were unable to qualify for the 'mainstream' course.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Women, Racism and the Economy

 Women's employment opportunities are inextricably linked to the issues of economy. The facts are that:

 Discrimination in education and training, hiring and remuneration, promotion and horizontal mobility practices, as well as inflexible working conditions, lack of access to productive resources and inadequate sharing of family responsibilities…and insufficient services such as childcare, continue to restrict employment, economic, professional and other opportunities and mobility for women and make their involvement stressful.

 What women said:

 Indigenous women in public service are rarely promoted to higher level positions. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» In schools, Indigenous and migrant women teachers are rarely promoted, and there are many more men in senior positions even though there are more female teachers. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Migrant women are discriminated against if speak they with an 'accent'. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Migrant women are unsuccessful in seeking promotions as, often, a perception exists that their English is not adequate for report writing etc. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Minimal recognition of overseas qualifications discriminates against immigrant/refugee women with regards to employment. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Indigenous and migrant applicants are rarely encouraged to apply for promotions or other, better, jobs. The promotion process can also be intimidating and demoralising, because they âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 HREOC Website: Racial Discrimination - Beyond Tolerance

 http://www.humanrights.gov.au/racial_discrimination/beyond_tolerance/speeches/dasvarma.html (5 of 10) [21/05/2002 1:25:46]

 are not encouraged to consider the jobs, and very rarely asked to undertake duties that could advance them.

 Racism in employment was common for racialised women on many levels. A pervasive problem was that it occurs in a subtle manner, and the subtlety renders it difficult to prove. Women also mentioned the awareness of anti-discrimination laws by some employers and service providers, who used their knowledge to ensure that their actions and behaviour could not be determined to be discriminatory in law, even though the effect was discriminatory.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Experiences were raised of Indigenous, immigrant or asylum-seeker women who possessed the skills and qualifications needed for positions but who were not being hired. In the cases where they were hired they often felt a great deal of pressure to prove themselves, resulting in diminished self-confidence. Two cases were cited of women who were forced to leave due to this kind of pressure.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Women, Racism and Poverty

 Intersectional discrimination in the area of housing access is integral to poverty.

 A 1991 report of the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy at the Australian National University indicated that at that time over half the homeless families seeking housing were Aboriginal and the proportion of Aboriginal families in public housing was almost seven times that of non-Aboriginal families.

 What women said:

 The private rental market remains a significant barrier to accessing housing, as women experience racism when applying for housing. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 It is especially difficult for Indigenous women to get private rental properties. Accounts were made of real estate agents lying about availability of properties to discourage Aboriginal women from applying, though the properties remain vacant for weeks. This is particularly common in regional areas.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Indigenous peoples receive inferior quality housing and inferior facilities compared to the rest of the population. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Refugee women have been placed in emergency housing in inappropriate and unsafe areas, and have suffered racial taunts and threats of violence. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Indigenous and African women in particular face racism in the form of excessive housing checks on the assumption that the property is not being taken care of. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Women, Racism and Health

 Indigenous women in Australia by far face some of the most serious health threats of any sector of the population. Reduced life expectancy and a higher proportion of low birth weight babies are some examples. These are the direct manifestations of the ongoing effects of dispossession and colonisation.

 Immigrant and asylum-seeker women also face compounded discrimination in terms of their health because of their racialised and gendered identities.

 Example: Some immigrant, refugee and asylum-seeker women may be based in workforces with poor occupational health and safety standards (such as outworking) as a result of not being able to secure better employment. Immigrant, refugee and asylum-seeker women are also at a greater risk of depression and mental illness due to the impact of migration or of fleeing a situation of torture or persecution.

 Indigenous women, immigrant and asylum seeker women not only experience severe health ramifications because of their own circumstances, but also face discrimination within the health profession.

 Health professionals need to look at the social and environmental causes of health problems and recognise that rather than simply medically treating the presenting symptoms, there needs to be a closer examination of a woman's living realities.

 What women said:

 Indigenous and migrant women are treated with less respect than others are when presenting at hospitals. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 There are widespread automatic responses to ethnicity. For example, presumptions of alcoholism and addiction because women are Indigenous. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 HREOC Website: Racial Discrimination - Beyond Tolerance

 http://www.humanrights.gov.au/racial_discrimination/beyond_tolerance/speeches/dasvarma.html (6 of 10) [21/05/2002 1:25:46]

 Reception staff practiced 'Gate-keeping' when Indigenous women tried to make Doctor's appointments. The effect was to discourage appointments being made, as it was presumed that the women would be late and defer or miss their appointment. Indigenous women were also exposed to these discrepancies in treatment while accompanying relatives who are not obviously Indigenous.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Hospitals and health services failed to offer or provide interpreter services. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» The increase in the international profile of female genital mutilation, or female circumcision, has created spaces for new manifestations of racism against African women in particular. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Women Racism and Human Rights

 Women of disadvantaged groups are both subject to human rights violations in disproportionate ways and do not have access to remedies on an equal basis.

 In Australia, Indigenous, immigrant, refugee and asylum-seeker women belong to the most disadvantaged groups and have a very distrustful relationship with the law, as the law offers them limited protection.

 Immigrant, refugee and asylum-seeker women in Australia suffer the consequences of having little or no knowledge of how to manoeuvre the legal system and their status as non-nationals further compromises their access to rights as citizenship laws in Australia can limit their recourse to domestic remedies.

 Indigenous women have traditionally had a hostile relationship with the legal system, which mandated many discriminatory practices, such as the removal of Indigenous children from their families.

 Example: Recent mandatory sentencing laws in some of Australia's states and territories have once again resulted in compounded discrimination against Indigenous women. Statistics prove that the imprisonment rates of Indigenous women during the enactment of the now repealed legislation in the Northern Territory increased by an astounding 232% in the first year of its operation. This legislation completely bypassed judicial discretion by automatically imposing an imprisonment sentence for property offences, such as stealing.

 What women said:

 Bail was often granted to violent male offenders in small communities, in full knowledge of the high risk of re-offending. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Mandatory sentencing had a disproportionate effect on women, and on Indigenous women in particular. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Not enough information about the legal system and people's rights was available in languages other than English. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Police regularly made assumptions of guilt or involvement in unlawful activity based on racial identity. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Judges were not sensitive to domestic violence issues in non-Western cultures or to the cultural traditions of women from non-Western cultures. For example, judges misread women's responses as submissive when they are not used to public speaking, or feel shame at being in court.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 It was difficult or impossible to articulate complaints of discrimination if they had been discriminated against as a non-white woman being treated differently to white women or non-white men.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Laws are being used to condone discrimination - for example, employers who know their responsibilities under the Racial Discrimination Act and Sex Discrimination Act can act in a way that discriminates in subtle and less tangible ways, so even though the effect is discriminatory, they remain within the law.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The Australian Government should endorse the Optional Protocol for the Convention Eliminating All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) to allow women in Australia an international avenue for redress

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Women, Racism and our Institutions

 Institutional mechanisms to address experiences of intersectional discrimination remain limited and inflexible. The low participation of Indigenous, immigrant and asylum-seeker women in decision-making positions, whether in government departments, or service organisations, contributes to the lack of responsiveness of remedial mechanisms to intersectional subordination.

 HREOC Website: Racial Discrimination - Beyond Tolerance

 http://www.humanrights.gov.au/racial_discrimination/beyond_tolerance/speeches/dasvarma.html (7 of 10) [21/05/2002 1:25:46]

 Institutional issues affecting women:

 Increasing centralisation of government services, through call centres, often makes non-English speaking background women feel alienated and not in control as they are unsure of what options to choose on the phone.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs funded Community Settlement workers are sometimes based at Christian charity or social justice services which has the effect of diminishing access by non-Christian women.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Women from particular backgrounds who apply for refugee status on the grounds of domestic violence situations are denied asylum despite clear evidence of domestic violence occurring.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Structural government decisions that do not consider experiences of intersectional discrimination can compound discrimination and its impacts. For example, the Office of the Status of Women refer migrant women to the Department of Multicultural Affairs because it does not deal with 'migrant issues'. In addition the language used by governments, such as 'illegal migrant' or 'provisional visas' create second-class citizens.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Limited resources for English language classes, and restrictions placed on availability only to those within the first five years of arrival have adverse implications for women, specifically on older women who are isolated at home.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Hostels and shelters have been known to turn away Indigenous women. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Emergency relief agencies have refused to provide domestic violence victims with household supplies, like mattresses, and only when senior agency staff were confronted about this, were the supplies provided.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Cultural needs of certain groups of women, particularly strongly religious women, are not considered or disregarded. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Government information is not provided in community languages, limiting access to services, including interpreters. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Very little provision is made for women-only space to ensure their full participation in consultations, particularly on topics that might be unsuitable for discussion in a mixed sex group.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Very often service providers perceive providing services to racialised or Indigenous women as an extra or optional service if funds allow, and not as part of regular services. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Racism is experienced due to a lack of government provision of Translator Interpreter Services; it is a user pays system. The unwillingness to pay is problematic in instances where understanding is essential, such as being in hospital for domestic violence or when in legal trouble.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Refugee women don't want to be identified as such due to the negative language used about refugees, and because of the negative stereotype that has been created in the media. There is a need for increased language and literacy skills for refugee women to create the space to claim back their dignity in the media.

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 What you can do

 Using the concept of intersectional discrimination, the human rights system that we have can be transformed because the different types of identities we all have would then be recognised.

 This simple concept can make such a difference. That's why we need to work together as advocates to ensure that governments take this concept seriously and implement policies that can deliver basic human rights for all women in Australia.

 If one woman doesn't matter, than nobody matters.

 What do we want our governments and United Nations agencies to do?

 Women, Racism and Education

 1. Incorporate Indigenous studies, including Indigenous history, culture and languages, as a compulsory component of primary and secondary school curriculum.

 2. Implement different styles of teaching and educating, such as story telling and the passing down of oral history, into the educational curriculum.

 HREOC Website: Racial Discrimination - Beyond Tolerance

 http://www.humanrights.gov.au/racial_discrimination/beyond_tolerance/speeches/dasvarma.html (8 of 10) [21/05/2002 1:25:46]

 3. Launch mass educational programs to break down stereotypes and racist assumptions about Indigenous, immigrant, refugee and asylum-seeker peoples.

 4. Train educational professionals, such as teachers and university professors, in cross-cultural sensitivity and issues as part of their teaching qualifications. And ensure that academics involved in research into cultures other than their own undertake cultural awareness training and employ participatory action research methodologies.

 5. Recognise prior educational qualifications of refugee and migrant peoples and grant them similar qualifications in their adopted country.

 6. Require school principals and teachers to develop programs that encourage their students to express issues about racism through drama, artwork, and other mediums.

 Women Racism and the Economy

 7. Legislate to protect immigrant, refugee and asylum-seeker women in informal employment, including home-working or outworking, domestic work, and the sex industry to prioritise their human rights, and undertake an awareness-raising program working with community organisations, ethnic communities and unions to ensure that these women know how to protect their rights.

 8. Recognise the special employment needs of refugee and immigrant women and design special programs offering skills training and orientation with the local job market and economic culture. These programs should be conducted both in English and the language of origin. Further, their skills and qualifications must be recognised and accredited for easier access to employment opportunities, and ensure recognition of previous experience.

 9. Design a specialised, temporary benefit for refugee and migrant women who are in need to aid them in making the transition to a new life in their host country.

 Women, Racism and Poverty

 10. Ensure that Indigenous communities are consulted about housing assistance and welfare schemes and that they approve the architecture and policies for allocated Indigenous public housing. The extended familial relationships of these families also needs to be considered in social security benefits and public housing guidelines need to be flexible, especially to accommodate those who are sheltering homeless relatives.

 11. Ensure that newly-arrived immigrants and refugees are placed in culturally appropriate public housing in communities where comprehensive anti-racism public education programs have been undertaken.

 Stolen Generations

 12. Endorse the recommendations of the HREOC Bringing them Home report, which include an apology and acknowledgment of past atrocities.

 13. Investigate and implement alternative strategies for resolving compensation issues for members of the Stolen Generations other than through the court system; starting by establishing the National Compensation Fund recommended under the HREOC Inquiry.

 Women, Racism and Human Rights

 14. Create, maintain, and further resource legal aid services, and ensure their accessibility to vulnerable women.

 15. Develop community legal education campaigns about rights; translate them into community languages, and distribute them where women are likely to find the information (for example, doctors' offices, local councils).

 16. Repeal all discriminatory legislation, such as Western Australia's mandatory sentencing laws.

 Women, Racism and Institutions

 17. Australian government and the relevant United Nations bodies protect the rights of Indigenous, immigrant, refugee and asylum-seeker women to act and speak for themselves by providing funding and resources for training, support and access to the relevant places - such as the various United Nations human rights treaties - to the women themselves and to the non-government organisations committed to their self-determination.

 18. Provide adequate resources for meaningful participation that prioritises women's participation in decision-making around issues that affect them.

 19. Review government and United Nations structures to assess the most effective and representative way that
