 Downer’s failure requires Senate inquiry    

 The Foreign Affairs Minister’s failure to grant political asylum and  protection for Chinese diplomat Chen Yonglin requires scrutiny by a  Senate inquiry, Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.    

 “Given Mr Downer’s and his department’s failures, I have also written  to the NSW Police Minister asking that urgent protection is provided for  Mr Chen and his family,” Senator Brown said.    

 The proposed Senate inquiry, to be moved next week, is as follows:    

 That the following matters be referred to the Senate Foreign Affairs,  Defence and Trade References Committee for inquiry and report by 9  August 2005   

 the Australian Government’s response to the defection of Chinese  diplomat Chen Yonglin including:  a)      any information, advice, assistance or protection, or lack  thereof, given to Mr Chen from any Australian Government official  including advice that may have endangered Mr Chen’s well being  b)      the response of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his  department to Mr Chen’s application for asylum and whether the  minister gave proper consideration to the request  c)      the response of the Minister for Immigration and her department  to Mr Chen’s application for asylum and whether the minister gave  proper consideration to the request  d)     the response of Australia’s agencies, including security agencies,  to the defection  e)      any contact between the Australian and Chinese Governments in 

 relation to the defection  f)       any related matters
