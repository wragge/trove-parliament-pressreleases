 MEDIA RELEASE

 Greens slam old parties’ asylum policies   

 The Australian Greens’ National Council has voted unanimously to condemn the old  parties and their race to the bottom on refugee policies.   

 “The old parties are waging war on refugees and Australia’s generous heart is under  attack,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The government’s open ended commitment to cruelty in PNG is going to cost us so  much in so many ways and Tony Abbott’s war on refugees is ridiculous and  irresponsible.   

 “The damage that these policies are doing to Australia’s international reputation, and the  suffering we’re inflicting on vulnerable people, cannot be reversed easily.   

 “We need a new way on refugee policy, but the old parties are failing to deliver.   

 “What we need to see is a commitment to a genuine regional approach that cares for  refugees with the kind of political leadership shown after the Vietnam War.   

 “The Houston Panel recommended Australia take 3,800 refugees out of Indonesia,  giving them a safer pathway to protection.   

 “Australia must fund refugee assessments in Indonesia to clear the backlog and stop  people from being forced onto dangerous boats.   

 “The Greens care for refugees and want to see them given a safer way to reach  protection than a boat journey from Indonesia.”   

 The Australian Greens’ National Council voted to unanimously support the follow  statement on the weekend;   

 The Australian Greens condemn the recent policy announcements by Kevin Rudd and  the Labor Party and Tony Abbott and the Coalition parties on refugees and asylum  seekers as cruel, ineffective and damaging to Australia’s global reputation.    

 The Australian Greens call for a new approach to refugee policy. The Australian Greens  believe:   

 ï· The fundamental first principle that refugees are people who deserve our care.  

 ï· That boat arrivals of asylum seekers be treated as a humanitarian issue.  

 ï· That Australia should adopt a genuine regional approach that cares for refugees  with the kind of political leadership shown after the Vietnam War.  

 ï· The Houston Panel recommendations that Australia take 3,800 refugees out of  Indonesia, giving them a safer pathway to protection should be adopted  immediately.
