 More AWB revelations:  Now its AusAid in Alia’s sweet embrace   

 First we learned that Austrade was involved in meetings with Alia, Saddam  Hussein’s front company, before even Volcker had heard of it.    

 Now documents I have obtained through Freedom of Information indicate that  AusAid was also linked to Alia. In February 2003, AWB wanted AusAid to buy out  their Iraqi Wheat contract which they were worried would be left stranded by the  outbreak of war. They achieved this with the support of National Party leader 

 Mark Vaile.   

 This wheat contract was corrupt. On March 14, 2003, AWB made a payment of  US$ 2.7 million to Alia for the 50,860 tonne shipment of wheat aboard the Pearl  of Fujairah. This payment was a kickback paid 4 days before the Coalition of the  Willing invaded Iraq.   

 The document I have obtained states that “AusAid is consulting with AWB Ltd  and international partners to finalise costing and the mechanisms to enable this  wheat to be delivered to meet urgent food aid requirements”.   

 Not since Pauline Hansen’s “please explain” would there have been such total  incomprehension as the response from AWB’s international partner, Alia, to  AusAid’s contact to arrange delivery of the wheat. After all, it delivered kickbacks  to Saddam, not wheat.   

 The idea that wheat exports to Iraq - and therefore kickbacks to Saddam - were  AWB’s domain alone is a monstrous fraud. Austrade officials met with Alia,  Ministers’ offices were informed of the Tigris deal, and here we have AusAid  taking over a wheat export contract - kickbacks included - lock, stock and barrel.   

 The Howard Government was involved in these corrupt wheat deals up to its  eyeballs. Its attempt to evade responsibility for this is so brazen it would have 

 embarrassed Christopher Skase. It will be fascinating to see what the Cole  inquiry makes of the AusAid contract.

  UNCLASSIFIED  TALKING POINTS;  IRAQ:  FOOD AID  24 March  2003 

  The Government announced on 21 March the purchase of  100,QQO u  metric tonnes of Australian wheat to support the provision of 

  urgent food aid for the Iraqi people.  . 

  This food aid is in addition to Australia's $17.5  million  contribution to preparations for humanitarian relief operations in  Iraq. 

  he Government takes the humanitarian needs of people of Iraq  ery seriously, particularly during this difficult  period 

  -  The World Food Programme estimates  that food supplies for  the most vulnerable people in Iraq are unlikely to last  beyond May 

  -  Approximately 60% of the Iraqi population  are dependent  upon food rations, which had been provided under the UN  Oil-for-Food  Programme.  This programme has been  suspended for the time being. 

  -  The Government is working closely and actively with the  United States and the United Kingdom to secure the  resumption of the Oil-for-Food  programme as soon as  possible. 

  Two shipments of Australian wheat (50,000 tonnes each) are in the  region  and are ready to deliver their humanitarian supplies  as soon  as ports and other distribution points can be secured 

  -  Australia has responded quickly to ensure that essential  food  aid is available for distribution to the Iraqi people at very  short notice, although it may not be possible to distribute it  fully until after the conflict. 

  -  The Australian wheat will support the efforts of other  countries, including the United States, and international  organisations  to help prevent a humanitarian crisis in Iraq.

  Australia has a proud record of providing humanitarian assistance  and 

  emergency aid. Iraqis have been dependent on food aid for some  time  (see earlier talking points).  Australia has been the major supplier of  wheat to Iraq under the Oil-for-Food  programme. 

  For over fifty years Australian wheat growers have provided the Iraqi  people with high quality wheat. The Government is confident that this  will continue into the future. 

  The Australian aid program is proud to reflect  the support of fellow  Australians, including AWB Ltd, for humanitarian relief in Iraq.

  UNCLASSIFIED 

  Was Australia asked to provide food aid?  The World Food Programme has published its contingency plan for  providing food aid in Iraq.  The agency has asked donors  for  J million  and that target has yet to be met. WFP  post-conflict  planning aims to meet the needs of 9.6 million people. 

  The Australian Government takes very seriously its humanitarian  responsibilities  to the people  of Iraq, and we are working with our  international partners and international organisations to help prevent a  humanitarian crisis in Iraq.

  event of conflict.  UN subsequently revised projected requirements  to March and 

  requested a further US$86.7 million.  WFP still requires US$11. 7 million  to  preposition  food  stocks for two million people for one month.  On 13 March,  WFP  advised Australia  and other donors that it would need assistance totalling  US$1.2  billion to feed  the entire Iraqi population (27.5 million) for  six months.  This would be  revised to US$300 million  if the Oil for  Food pipeline became available.  This request  is expected  to form  the most substantial part of the UN Flash Appeal,  to be released  to donors on 26 March. 

  Scenarios have been developed by international agencies  but humanitarian needs in  Iraq will clearly depend  upon the nature and duration of hostilities.  Needs are  expected  in the water, sanitation,  health, shelter and food sectors.  Estimates of  refugee numbers range from 600,000 to 1 .45 million, and between  900,000 and 2  million newly displaced within Iraq.  Some reports  indicate up to 5 million people  could be at risk of  malnutrition.

Mr Downer announced, on 20 March, an additional $7.5  million  to assist in preparations  for humanitarian relief operations in Iraq  and the region. 

  Two shipments each carrying 50,000t of AWB Ltd wheat under the OFF Program are  currently in the Gulf region, and have been diverted due to the outbreak of hostilities  in Iraq and the suspension  of the OFF program.  AusAID  is  consulting  with AWB  Ltd and international partners  to finalise costings and the mechanisms  to enable this  wheat to be delivered to meet urgent food  aid requirements.
