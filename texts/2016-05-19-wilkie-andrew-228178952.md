 Dutton must resign as Immigration Minister   

 

 

 The Independent Member for Denison, Andrew Wilkie, will call on Immigration Minister  Peter Dutton to resign over his comments about refugees.    

 WHEN: 1:00pm TODAY 19 May  WHERE: International Wall of Friendship (sunken garden), 188 Collins St, HOBART    

 “Peter Dutton’s recent claims that illiterate refugees will take Australian jobs is racist, are  disgusting, and must be condemned,” Mr Wilkie said. “He must immediately resign.”    

 “And if Peter Dutton won’t resign, then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has to step up and  sack him. If Turnbull doesn’t, it makes him every bit as bad as Dutton.    

 “This really gives the game away when it comes to Australia’s current refugee policy. This is  proof that the Government’s border protection policies are just all about racism, fear and  division.    

 “We can do better than this kind of reckless fearmongering. We can do better than cruel  policies like offshore processing, towbacks and mandatory detention. And we can do a lot  better than Peter Dutton.”
