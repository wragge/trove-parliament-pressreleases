 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 05/093 THURSDAY 3 MARCH 2005   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS SPOKESPERSON ON IMMIGRATION  VANSTONE’S SKILLED MIGRATION PLAN AN ADMISSION OF FAILURE & HYPOCRISY The Immigration Minister’s reported push for a massive leap of 20,000 in the number of skilled migrants, is a sign this Government has failed badly in its handling of asylum seekers and in ensuring enough Australians have needed skills and training, according to the Australian Democrats.  “There are enormous skills amongst many of the refugees and family migrants which this Government has gone to such lengths to prevent from settling in Australia,” Senator Bartlett, the Democrats Deputy Leader and Immigration spokesperson, said.  “Australia’s immigration system discriminates against on the grounds of age, family status and disability, just to name a few. Skilled families with disabled children are stopped from settling here, as are many refugee families with needed skills. “After spending so long creating an image of being tough on migration, now this Government wants to open a selective floodgate to fix a mess of its own making,” Senator Bartlett said. “Skills shortages are at the heart of the wages pressure which contributed to the interest rate rise. “When so many Australians can neither afford nor access places at TAFEs and Universities to improve their skills, it is outrageous that this Government is desperately looking to the quick fix of importing a solution to the economic mess they have now created,” Senator Bartlett said. “This is hypocritical and an admission of failure, and the Government’s plan is very unlikely to work. “Just a couple of years ago, the previous Minister, Mr Ruddock was saying that we wouldn’t be able to attract huge extra numbers of skilled migrants because of the worldwide demand for such people, yet now the Government is desperately searching for a quick fix to a dilemma of their own making.” “The only way they could get so many people to come to Australia under the ‘skilled’ category is by setting the bar so low that we would be getting poorly-skilled workers anyway. “It is time for this Government to admit its own failure on economic and labour market management and stop its discriminatory approach to migration,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
