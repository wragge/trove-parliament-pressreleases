 MEDIA RELEASE For immediate release

 Labor's incompetence threatens border protection efforts

 Last week, fifty illegal asylum seekers were stranded for five days after their boat hit a reef in the Torres Straight, as there was confusion from the Government on how to respond.

 "The Rudd Labor Government needs to come clean on their bungled management of our border protection system and admit it simply isn't working," Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs Sussan Ley said today.

 "Minister for Home Affairs, Bob Debus, needs to explain to the Australian people how is it possible that fifty illegal immigrants could leave Sri Lanka and approach Australia without anyone having a clue?

 "How is it possible, with the new intelligence role of the recently renamed and much-hyped Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, that this illegal vessel with fifty people on board could move across the northern waters and then be stranded for five days on a reef in the Torres straight, completely undetected?" Ms Ley said.

 "Responsibility for border protection was transferred from Defence to Customs late last year. It appears that the Labor Government has not thought this through and has failed to adequately train Customs officers to deal with this type of situation.

 "There has been a rapid escalation in illegal boat arrivals since the Rudd Labor Government changed the rules relating to asylum seekers in August last year.

 "The global economic crisis is going to see even more people attempt to enter our country illegally," Ms Ley said.

 "It is not good enough for Minister Debus to say that our border protection system is working because the illegal boatload was eventually picked up. Isn't the point of the new intelligence role of Customs to stop them from leaving in the first place?

 "Our border protection system is leaking left right and centre due to Labor's incompetent and soft approach. They simply cannot be trusted to keep Australia's borders safe." Ms Ley said.
