 MARK BUTLER MP  Minister for Mental Health and Ageing   

 SPEECH   

 2011 Primary Health Care Research Conference  “Inspirations, Collaborations, Solutions”  Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre, South Bank, Brisbane  Wednesday 13 July 2011 

 

 Thank you very much, Auntie Valda, for your welcome to country.    

 I too would like to begin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land on which we meet  and pay my respects to their elders, both past and present.   

 Can I also acknowledge:  â¢ A/Professor Ellen McIntyre (Director of the Primary Health Care Research and Information  Service) and the two keynote speakers,   â¢ Dr Dame Claire Bertschinger; and  â¢ Professor Kim Bennell    

 Thanks very much for the invitation to address you at today’s conference. It’s wonderful to see so  many from the community of practitioner and researchers interacting and sharing knowledge n the  field of primary health care.  

 

 I’m really pleased to be here with you today, at what is both a very exciting and challenging time for  the primary health sector.    

 Exciting, because the Australian Government is building a National Health and Hospitals Network  which involves taking full funding and policy responsibility for primary health care services in  Australia.  

 

 It’s also a very challenging time - as you would know, our health care system is being challenged by  a combination of pressures including the growing burden of chronic disease, an ageing population,  workforce shortages, and unacceptable inequities in health outcomes and access to services.   

 

 Frankly, primary health care in Australia has tended to operate as a disparate set of services, rather  than an integrated service system. It has been difficult for primary health care to respond effectively  to changing pressures (such as demographic change, changes in the burden of disease, emerging  technologies and changing clinical practice), and to coordinate within and across the various  elements of the broader health system to meet the needs of an individual patient.  

 

 While it’s important that we acknowledge these challenges, I also stand here today to reaffirm the  Government’s commitment to improve our  primary health care system. Underpinning our  commitment is the National Primary Health Care Strategy which represents the first comprehensive 

  1  

  2  

 national policy statement for primary health care in Australia, and provides the platform for a  stronger and more efficient primary health care system that we need into the future.    

 The strategy itself identifies the 4 key priority areas where change is most needed to set up the  system of the future. The 4 key priority areas for change are:   

 1) Improving access and reducing equity  2) Better management of chronic conditions  3) Increasing the focus on prevention  4) Improving quality, safety, performance and accountability.    

 A number of very significant reforms are being implemented under these key areas, to help us build  a more responsive and integrated primary health care system. It’s worth touching on some of these  reforms to demonstrate the progress we’re making to meet the needs of Australians and address  fragmentation between different parts of the system.    

 Ensuring that all Australians can access health care that is suitable for their particular needs and  circumstances at the time they need it, is one of the major challenges facing our current primary  health care system. It’s also what drives some of the health reforms we’ve undertaken, including:  

 

 Medicare Locals are a fundamentally important part of our primary care strategy. These  organisations, operating at local and regional level, are being set up to help coordinate and integrate  services, address service gaps in local areas and regions, and help bring GPs and other health  professionals together. From this month, the first 19 Medicare Locals have received funding from the  Government to help patients and professionals navigate our complex system more easily. People  with mental health and aged care needs will be better served by these organisations. The first  Medicare Locals started operating 1 July and will have a key role in helping to make it easier for  Australians to see and contact a doctor.   

 The first of July also signalled the commencement of our after hours GP service, For the first time,  people will be able to pick up the phone and talk to a nurse or GP to get advice and, if needed,  referred to their nearest open after-hours service  

 As you know, this year’s Budget included a comprehensive mental health reform package.  The  budget funds a range of innovative measures for mental health primary care, including -    

 â¢ National coverage of the primary mental health service for young Australians - headspace  â¢ Doubling the funding to GP Divisions and Medicare Locals under the Access to Allied  Psychology Services or ATAPS program - targeting low SES and Indigenous  communities and young children in particular 

 â¢ A comprehensive e-mental health strategy to buttress the face to face primary sector  â¢ A revolutionary approach to the co-ordination of clinical and non-clinical services for the  most severely unwell  â¢ And much more   

 A strong and integrated primary health care system is critical to the future success and sustainability  of our entire health system.  Together, the health reform measures will ensure that care is  coordinated at the local level across the acute, primary health and aged care sectors.  Health reform  will assist people to choose and access their most suitable health provider by better integrating care  and making it easier for patients to navigate their local health care system.

 But, of course, reform can’t happen without the research and the evidence base to back up what  works.    

 Improvements in patient and community health outcomes are achieved through better practice and  relevant policies, which often have their genesis in research findings and evidence.   

 As you know, following the budget I announced a review into Health and Medical Research.  I am  currently consulting on the Terms of Reference for the review, and plan to announce the final ToRs  by the end of July.  

 

 The draft ToRs are available on the department web site, and you can submit comments through the  list of peak organisations there.    

 It’s been some time since the last review into medical research - the Wills Review.  That review,  undertaken in 1999, resulted in significant increases in funding over ten years, and has led to the  record levels of investment we see today.  But more than that, it set out a vision for medical  research over a ten-year period.  We think it’s time to undertake that kind of thinking again. 

 

 This is a bigger agenda than the amount of money the Government is investing in research. The  research landscape is changing and our investment should reflect this changed landscape, what the  research sector sees as important, as well as the community. For one thing, the burden of disease  has altered significantly. Chronic disease and mental health have replaced acute infectious diseases  and acute vascular events as the leading cause of morbidity and mortality.   

 I’m very excited about this review and its potential to chart a clear path for the next 10 years or so  for Australian research and encourage you to follow it closely.   

 But, of course, we already have a number of specific research strategies in place - not least in  primary care.    

 Many of you here today would be familiar with the Primary Health Care Research, Evaluation and  Development (PHCRED) Strategy 2010-2014 which plays an important role in the provision of  evidence to inform policy development and supporting the implementation of the primary health care  reforms.  

 

 The next phase of the PHCRED Strategy will;  (i) continue to build capacity in the primary health care research sector  (ii) add to the body of knowledge and evidence of primary health care research and  (iii) actively promulgate primary health care research to engender effective knowledge 

 exchange, and improve clinical practice and patient outcomes.   

 Under phase three of the PHCRED Strategy 2010 - 2014 the research capacity building element will  move away from funding many small projects via the RCBI, towards the funding of a network of  Centres of Research Excellence (CREs). 

 

 This network will better connect primary health care researchers and offer a more sustainable and  effective means of collaboration between researchers across Australia and internationally than  current arrangements. 

 The aims of the CRE program include: 

  4  

 â¢ the generation of high quality primary health care research that informs policy and 

 practice, leading to improved primary health care services and health outcomes for the  Australian community  â¢ multi-disciplinary collaboration across the Australian primary health care research 

 community  â¢ build Australian primary health care research capacity through career development of 

 research leaders and new researchers.   

 The CRE’s major research theme and projects will be aligned to key health priority areas as  identified in the National Primary Health Care Strategy and relevant to the COAG health reform  agenda.  Each CRE is expected to include capacity building and include no less than:  â¢ four post-doctorate fellowships of minimum twelve months’ duration 

 â¢ two PhD candidates engaged in research projects 

 â¢ four scholarships or bursaries of a minimum six months’ duration for pre-higher degree 

 individuals to engage in CRE research activities or to assist a senior researcher in a CRE  project.   

 Each CRE will also have a capacity to undertake “rapid response” research to answer specific policy  questions.   

 Each funded CRE will receive a minimum of $2.5 million over four years.  In recognition of the particular circumstances involved with conducting research in rural and remote  Australia, additional funding of up to $500,000 over four years will be provided to CREs with a core  research focus on rural and remote primary health care.  The CRE will be required to expend at  least $250,000 on research conducted in a physically remote environment, such as support for  rurally-based researchers.   

 In a demonstration of the success of this program, I’m told that one of the current three CREs is  conducting research on: accessible and equitable primary health care service provision in rural and  remote Australia.  This CRE includes a collaboration of university departments in rural health in 

 Moe, Alice Springs and Broken Hill.   

 Launch of Snapshot of Australian primary health care research 2011   

 I took great pleasure in launching the 2009 Snapshot of Australian primary health care research at  the opening of the 2009 General Practice & Primary Health Care Research Conference.   

 This 2011 Snapshot publication builds on the success of previous issues and showcases examples  of Australian primary health care research produced under the PHCRED Strategy.   

 The Snapshot of Australian Primary Health Care Research has been published since 2008.  This is  the fourth printed edition.  Over the last two editions the basis for inclusion of articles in the  publication has been more closely linked to the health reform agenda and the National Primary  Health Care Strategy. 

 

 As Associate Professor Ellen McIntyre has advised in the snapshot foreword “The Australian  Government recognises that primary health care research plays a vital role in generating the  evidence base for best practice”.   

  5  

 Helping people to have access to health care when and where they need it is a priority for national  health reform.  Best practice is critical to the success and sustainability of our primary health care  system for the immediate and emerging needs of communities.   

 The eleven research projects featured in this year’s snapshot publication showcase some of the  exceptional research conducted under the strategy  â¢ It features projects on important issues such as how to optimise access to best practice in  primary health care 

 â¢ It analyses pharmacist recommendations in aged care and studies the feasibility and  impact of cardiovascular absolute risk assessment in general practice  â¢ It documents the health service experience of refugee and asylum seekers and of  culturally and linguistically diverse populations  â¢ Other projects make important observations on issues such as effective change 

 management in ambulatory care service, building research capacity in allied health, and  improving quality through clinical governance in primary care.   

 I wish to join Associate Professor Ellen McIntyre in congratulating and encouraging the researchers  for their work featured in Snapshot of Australian primary health care research 2011.   

 It also gives me great pleasure to declare this conference open and reiterate that the Australian  Government really values the significant work that you are doing.
