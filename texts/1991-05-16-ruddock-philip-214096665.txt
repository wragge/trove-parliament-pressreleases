 REFUGEES - A FIRM HAND IS NEEDED

 It is clear that the handling of refugee claims is undermining Australia's  ability to maintain the integrity of its borders. World-wide experience, but  particularly in Europe and Canada, demonstrates that expectations and 

 perceptions can undermine effective supervision and control.

 The Australian Government failed to send the correct signal to the world  when it allowed 20,000 Chinese students temporary entry in 1990 and held  out the promise of permanency in the future.

 The result was, instead of 500 claimants on-shore for protection, we now  have 14,000. They are increasing at the rate of 1000 per month. By the years  end they will exceed 20,000. Over 8000 of the present 14,000 claimants are  PRC nationals who arrived post the Tienanmen Square events of June 1989.

 Now the Government is failing the next test.

 Over the space of 18 months some 300 people have arrived on our shores  claiming to be Vietnamese or Khmer requiring protection. Few, if any, have  lodged claims for protection in the proper form. While the Government has  advised that it now has arrangements in place for Khmer to be returned if  they have no substantial claims or need for protection as refugees or on  humanitarian grounds, no individual has been returned.

 In fact, no claims for protection have been determined.

 - 2 -

 Is it any wonder that expectations are developing abroad that all that is  required for re-settlement in Australia is to buy passage by any means  available.

 The Government needs to enhance and expedite the process of refugee  determination particularly of those treated as unprocessed entrants (ie boat  people).

 Clear time limits need to be imposed on the lodging of applications.

 Proper advice needs to be furnished to individuals, on arrival in Australia,  of the need to ensure any claims are put promptly and within a specified  time limit.

 Access to independent advise needs also to be available to ensure natural  justice rules are met.

 Manipulation of the rules must not be permitted.

 The fact of 14000 refugee claimants has already prompted one legal adviser  in Sydney to boast that with substantial delay of many years duration, it was  appropriate for many illegal entrants to lodge claims for refugee or  humanitarian protection no matter how frivolous the claims.

 It is Canberra's failure to properly administer the arrangements for refugee  determination in a timely fashion that will lead to a breakdown in our ability  to provide proper protection to those in genuine need.

 Attached are:

 - Hansard copy of questions asked in Senate Estimates Committee to  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs officials on refugee numbers.

 - Answer to a question asked in the Senate on possible arrangements  for Khmer claimants to be returned to Cambodia.

 SENATE QUESTION

 Question without Notice

 (Q uestion No )

 Senator Tambling asked the Minister Representing the  Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Bthnio  Affairs on n  March 1991 a question without notice*

 about Cambodian boat people in Australia, which, inter alia,  made reference to the Government consideration of the claims  of these people to remain in Australia and whether this was  dependent upon the negotiation of arrangements for return of 

 the Cambodians. The Minister undertook that if there was  any further information that he could usefully provide, he  would do so.

 Senator Bolkus - The Minister for Immigration, Local  Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following  additional information to the answer which I provided to  senator Tambling's question*

 On 11 March, in a question in the Senate, Senator Tambling  asked whether the assessment of the Cambodian boat people  against refugee criteria was dependent upon the failure to  negotiate arrangements for the return of them.

 As at 30 April 1991, the status O f  the 224 (now 259)  C a m b o d i a n s  i s  not yet resolved. Twenty-six full and final  applications have now been received from members of the  Melbourne group, and 16 from members of the Sydney group. 

 Further finalised applications are still awaited for the  remainder of these two groups. The Darwin group are yet to  submit any applications.

 I have deliberately allowed those involved time to seek all  available assistance in the preparation of their  applications. This has resulted in a situation where most  have yet to lodge applications.

 The consideration of their claims is a lengthy and complex  process and I do not expect final decisions on any of the  group for some time yet.

 I do not want to become involved in speculation about the  outcome of the decision on these claims until the decision  process is complete.

 jt is far from clear what may emerge from this process.  Those whose claims are accepted will be able to remain under  the conditions provided for refugee asylum. Others whose  claims fall short of refugee status but who have strong  humanitarian claims may be allowed to stay. Those who do 

 not meet the refugee criteria and who do not have other  admissible claims will be required to leave.

 In this context officials from my department discussed  possible arrangements for return with the authorities in  Phnom Penh in June 1990. These discussions resulted in a  simple arrangement for return being prepared and agreed.

 This was reflected in an exchange of notes at an operational  level by the officials involved.

 The arrangements proposed closely follow normal deportation  procedures that apply to all people who are required to  depart Australia. The slightly novel aspect of the  arrangements as discussed arose from the fact that I 

 believed that the Government needed to ensure that normal  and acceptable arrangements for return existed and would be  met. This appears to be the case.

 The situation in Cambodia is very complex. Opportunities  for people in Cambodia to emigrate are limited. There are  many seeking family reunification with families in other  countries including Australia. As a consequence I have 

 instructed my department to explore the possibility of  establishing arrangements for the emigration of the family  of Cambodian Australians from the territory of the State of  Cambodia. To this end a delegation of senior officers from  my department visited Phnom Penh recently to discuss  possible arrangements. These initial discussions (held over 

 the period 2 - 5  April) were most useful and I am confident  that effective arrangements will be established in the near  future.

 DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS PROGRAM 1-MIGRATION AND VISITOR ENTRY  Subprogram 1.2-Permanent entiy

 Senator TEAGUE-Has there been a doubling  of applications? Fourteen thousand 

 outstanding ones seems a great deal more  than I had been used to a few years ago. Mr Gibbons-There has been a dramatic  increase in applications for refugee status. If  you go back two years, the average number of 

 claimants per year were 300 to 500. The  events of Tiananmen Square in June 1989  saw a dramatic rise in applications from PRC  nationals, but there has also been a significant

 rise from persons of other nationalities. Senator TEAGUE- F inally can I ask a  question on notice. Could this Committee  receive a two or three page summary of the  new procedure, the new staff structure and  the new appeals aspect? Secondly, could you  provide a set of statistics from recent years  giving the number of applications-especially  with regard to the 14,000 outstanding in the  current year-and a list giving numbers of the  citizens of countries that have made 

 applications? Mr Gibbons·We can provide that. Senator KEMP-How long would it take the  Department to clear the backlog of 14 ,000  students that you mentioned?

 Mr Gibbons-The decision taken by the  Government in October last year, after a  review of the whole process, provided  resources to clear the backlog by mid- 1993.  The objective is to have a processing time at  primary level of three months, and to clear all  processing in nine months.

 Senator KEMP-Is that figure of 14,000 still  growing rapidly, or has that plateaued? Mr Gibbons-It is growing at the rate of 1,000  a month.

 Senator KEMP-The processing is being  carried out at the rate of how many a month?  Have you reached over 1,000?

 Mr Gibbons-The previous DORS

 arrangements involve staffing for 500 cases a  year. The new operation is geared for this  higher level. That has involved a recruitment  process, which is coming to an end, training of 

 staff, commitments by other agencies to the  Committee and nomination of members by the  Refugee Council. All of that will not be  finalised until late this fiscal year. So we are

 not expecting a major increase in output until  early in the new fiscal year. At the moment  our resources are devoted to dealing with  claimants who are people in custody, border  arrivals-the high priority categories.

 Senator K EMP-Would it be fair to assume  that that figure of 14,000 may in fact grow to 20.000 by December this year? Mr Gibbons-Yes The assumptions include an  application rate of about 13,500 cases a year  for two years, as the PRC nationals in 

 Australia lodge applications. We see it  declining and stabilising at the rate of about 6.000 a year. Senator KEMP-On the current experience,  what proportion of people who apply for  permanent residence under this particular  program have their applications refused?

 Mr Gibbons-1 think our experience has seen a  successful application rate of below 20 per  cent. That was under the old regime where  applicants for refugee status were granted  permanent residence. Under the new 

 arrangements they get a temporary entry  permit valid for four years. Senator KEMP-Does the 20 per cent refer to 

 those people who were refused permanent  entry? Mr Gibbons-No, it refers to those who were  successful.

 Senator KEMP-Are you saying that those  who fail that test may get the four- year  extension? Mr Gibbons-No. We are talking about  determination of refugee status if they are not  granted that. Under the old arrangements if 

 they had lodged an application for grant of  resident status on compassionate or 

 humanitarian grounds it was considered under  the policy applicable there. A number would  have been granted permanent residence on  that basis. The new arrangement totally  separates the grant of resident status 

 application process from the determination of  refugee status arrangements. There is a safety  net provided under the refugee process to  cover people who do not qualify under the UN  Convention's protocols but where there is  nevertheless a claim for protection on  humanitarian grounds. The process involves
