 MEDIA RELEASE

 Senator Chris Evans Labor Senator for Western Australia Shadow Minister for Defence

 8 May 2002

 ROBERT HILL - DOING A ‘REITH’?

 The Minister for Defence has adopted the tactics of Peter Reith in denying the public information about Defence spending.

 “Robert Hill has refused to provide the full cost of the deployment to Afghanistan and the operation to deter unauthorised boat arrivals,” said Senator Chris Evans, Defence Shadow Minister.

 “The Minister made a commitment to provide this information when questioned in Senate Estimates in February this year.

 “Defence answers on these costs were then delayed six weeks while the Minister’s Office heavily edited the information to the point where it is meaningless.

 “The Australian people have a right to know what the current Defence operations are costing them.

 “Robert Hill promised accountability and openness and instead we have the continued politicisation of the Defence and the withholding of information from the public.

 “Defence has again been gagged from answering critical questions about its operations.

 “The Government is set to bring down a big Defence budget, while denying the public their right to know where the money will be spent.

 “The Minister’s deliberate attempt to suppress this information comes at a time when there are serious questions being asked about the management of Defence funding.

 “Why is Defence projected to have a cash surplus of over $300 million this year when there are shortages of ammunition and basic repairs and maintenance are stopped for a lack of funds?

 “The Minister must come clean and explain where Defence funds have been allocated.”

 Senate Hansard - 21 February 2002

 Senator CHRIS EVANS—I am happy for you to say to me, ‘It is $X million but $27 million of that was already allocated for the cost of maintaining HMAS Manoora for the year’ but I would like to know what it costs to run Operation Relex. I would also like to know about Gaberdine—I would like someone to explain Gaberdine to me. Senator Hill—I would like to give you a considered response to that because, in effect, I would have to define my answer because otherwise I think it becomes very misleading. The public concept is that if I say it has cost half a billion dollars they think we have had to fork out another half a billion dollars, which we have not. Senator CHRIS EVANS—My difficulty, Senator Hill, is that this is the budget estimates. You applied for extra money to meet the extra costs. I think everyone is well aware that these are recurring extra costs on the public purse. But really, you are suggesting to me that we ought to consider these estimates without knowing what the costs of these operations are. I put it to you that that is not a very reasonable proposition. So I am happy for you to give as much detail as you need to to make it clear how those costs are calculated, but I do want to understand how much that operation is costing us. Senator Hill—I understand that, but I do not have the definitions here. I have some estimates of figures, but without definitions I would not be happy to produce them. That is why I prefer to take it on notice and give you a written response that sets out exactly what the numbers mean. … Rear Adm. Ritchie—There is a method of cost calculation to work out full cost and that sort of thing, which can be provided. Senator Hill—When we give you our considered response to your earlier questions, implicitly we are going to have to provide that information. Senator CHRIS EVANS—I see, Senator. This is another case where you will not give it to me, rather than you do not have it, is it? Senator Hill—We, implicitly, will have to provide that information. We will have to work out— Senator CHRIS EVANS—Let me be clear. Are you saying you have the figure and you will not provide it? I thought Admiral Ritchie was saying he was not sure he had it with him. Mr Roche—We do not have a figure with us. Rear Adm. Ritchie—I do not have it with me, no. If we are to give you the full cost of Relex, we will have to tell you what it cost per day to employ Manoora, because we will not be able to work it out otherwise. Senator Hill—That is what I was trying to say. Vice Adm. Shackleton—Perhaps I can help. There is a costing methodology that we use to cost out the full cost of a platform, be it an aircraft, ship, submarine or indeed a person, which takes into account the full cost of ownership to Defence. Sometimes we use that number to bill people when we make our assets and services available to other people. Then there is the lesser cost, which is the daily average cost, which is simply the salaries, the fuel consumption, the food consumption, the ammunition and such. That is what we use in other kinds of calculations. There is a manual for this in Defence and I would expect that could probably be made available in due course.
