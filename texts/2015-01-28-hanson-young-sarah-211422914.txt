 SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 28 January 2015   

 High Court challenge exposes government’s  refugee secrecy   

 The Abbott government’s obsession with secrecy has been exposed by today’s High Court  challenge of its on-water detention practices, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “The arrogance of the Abbott government has been on full display in this case,” the Greens’  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The level of secrecy around this shameful prison ship was extremely disturbing. It was only this  challenge that forced the government to come clean with the Australian people about what they  were up to.   

 “Families, including women and children, were kept in disgraceful conditions and held in  shipping containers for weeks on end. These families are now languishing in the hellhole on  Nauru.   

 “It’s very disappointing that the government blackmailed the Senate crossbenchers into  changing the law to legalise this dangerous and harmful practice late last year.”
