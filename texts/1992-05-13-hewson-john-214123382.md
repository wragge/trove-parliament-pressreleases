 TRANSCRIPT OF DR JOHN HEWSON HP  PRESS CONFERENCE  70 PHILLIP STREET, SYDNEY

 E & Î E - PROOF COPY ONLY

 SUBJECTS: Immigration,  Liberal Leadership, ICAC Inquiry, Polls, APPM, Industrial Relations, WA Inc/Senator  Richardson -  .  . ·  .  S

 Hewson:  ,

 The first subject I wanted to raise is this statement by Gerry  Hand last night about the fact that the 20,000 ·  Chinese 

 students that were given special status might grow to 300,000  by the Year 2000. What that tells you is that this is a 

 national disgrace. It's incredible that the decision was  taken in the first place, and I have consistently criticised  Hawke's emotionalism which was the basis of that decision.

 20,000 students that arrived here before June 1989 have been  allowed to stay as long as they like, and that breaks down the  basic integrity of the immigration system, and it brings about  a whole lot of discrimination within the immigration program.  For example, there are another 15-18,000 Chinese students who  arrived after June 1989 who don't have that right, and who can  only seek to stay here either by applying to be considered a  refugee,  or by trying to qualify under the normal immigration  rules.  And it's absolutely ludicrous to have a situation  where you give a blanket admission to a special group of 

 people and recognise that that number can grow to 300,000 in  the next 7 or 8 years and not do anything about it.

 Now, I think Gerry Hand is really having a go at Paul Keating  here.  I don't think Gerry Hand's ever supported the decision  that Bob Hawke took,  and Paul Keating recently re-affirmed  that decision for a position of political expedience.  And we  have a situation now where Gerry Hand is calling on Paul 

 Keating to fix it. As far as I can see, Hand's taking the 

 view he's leaving Parliament anyway.  He doesn't want to go  out with a record as the worst Immigration Minister we've ever  had,  and so he's put Keating into hot water on that issue,

 REF: TRANSCR\NM\S0091 2 .

 And it is ludicrous.  To be clear, it's not related to the 

 fact that they're Chinese.  The same point would be made in  relation to any other nationality. They could be French or  German or Indonesian or whatever.  The fact is that the 

 integrity of the immigration program has been dramatically  undermined in those circumstances.

 The second issue that I've had questions about today relates  to the failure of the current Prime Minister, when Treasurer,  to give permission for the Western Australian Corruption  Inquiry to have access to relevant tax records.  This shows  you a classic double standard.  I mean,  this is vintage 

 Keating - one law for. his Labor mates and one law for the rest  of us. .

 He was quite happy to release tax information in relation to  the Fitzgerald Inquiry in Queensland because that had '  to do  with the activities of the Queensland National Party, and yet  how when it's WA Inc, and it's, the activities of the Labor 

 Party in Western Australia and links elsewhere in Australia,  he wants to separate that group out and treat them 

 differently. To my mind it is a ludicrous double standard  that is indefensible.

 Jrnlst:

 So Dr Hewson, are you saying that they were deliberately  withholding that information?

 Hewson:

 Well, they're obviously going to any length they can to make  sure that the Western Australian Corruption Inquiry cannot  have access to that information. Now, as far as I can see,   he's more than happy to turn the bucket on everybody else, but  when it might link into his Labor mates or indeed, perhaps 

 even to some in his Government, he withholds the information.   Now, he's got a lot of explaining to do.

 And the third point I wanted to make is, quite frankly, where  is Paul Keating? These are leadership issues for Keating -  the deficit has blown out and he's not around for comment.   He's got problems with Richo and his stand in defence of 

 Richo.  He's got problems in the immigration area with the  announcements yesterday by Gerry Hand, and he's now got this  inconsistency that's been thrown up in relation to access to  tax files for WA Inc.

 Where is Paul Keating? These are crucial tests of his 

 leadership and he's gone into the bunker and he's not prepared  to come out and answer these questions.

 Jrnlst:

 Are you concerned about unity in the Liberal Party...

 Hewson:

 No.

 Jrnlst:

 ...with two State leaders being replaced - and with what's  happening at the ICAC inquiry in New South Wales?

 Hewson:

 No. Look, this is a figment of Geoff Kitney's imagination,  that story today, quite frankly, in the Financial Review. I  honestly tire of reading stories written by Kitney that could  only have come from the Labor Party. They certainly didn't  come from the Liberal ..Party. The factors that led to a

 change of leadership in Western Australia are completely  unrelated to the factors that led to the leadership situation  in South Australia, Both of those in turn are completely  unrelated to what's happened in New South Wales.

 And as far as I'm concerned, as Federal Leader of the Federal  Party, looking at Federal issues,  they are State Divisional  matters in each case, or State Parliamentary matters.  And  although they may reflect,  to some extent,  in the minds of 

 people when they're asked how they would vote in a poll, 

 they've got nothing to do with the way we're performing, and  nothing to do with the opportunities that we are offering this  country by way of a policy alternative.  They've got nothing  to do with how we will perform at the next Federal election.

 There isn't a groundswell of opinion that's flooding around  from one bushfire to the next, as I read in today's paper.  These are three quite isolated and different issues that have  been motivated by quite different factors.

 Jrnlst:  ’

 Is there pressure on Nick Greiner in New South Wales over the  ICAC Inquiry from within the Liberal Party?

 Hewson:

 Well,  not from us. I mean,  I've had a very firm view all 

 along that Nick Greiner handles matter at the State level in  New South Wales, and I handle things at the Federal level.  I  don't tell him what to do, and he doesn't tell me what to do,  and it's the only way you can operate.  It is a State issue.  Sure, it's certainly affected the perceptions of Liberals,  if  you like,  in New South Wales, and as I've said many times,

 REF: TRANSCR\NM\S0091 4 .

 that's reflected in our poll standing in New South Wales.  But  that's something that will go when the problem is solved.  When the focus comes back on us, Federal issue, Federal level,   Federal campaign - as we saw when Fightback!  was released, of  course people's attitudes shift back to the Federal level, and 

 the polls will reflect that.

 So we live with the short-term fluctuations in polls, as I've  said consistently since I've been Leader.  They come and go  for a whole host of reasons. We're staying on our Federal  agenda and arguing our Federal issues and our Federal case.

 Jrnlst:

 What do you feel about being mentioned in Terry Metherall's  diary?

 Hewson:

 Well,  I don't know whether one should be flattered or not,  quite frankly.  I forget the context in which I was mentioned.   I think it may have something to do with Ted Pickering not  running.

 Jrnlst:

 He said he didn't think you could win federally.

 Hewson:

 Yes, well, that confirms, to my mind, that we probably will. 

 Jrnlst:

 Dr Hewson, on the APPM dispute,  how important do you think it  is for that strike to be broken?

 Hewson:

 Well, it'  e very difficult for us to comment on the detail of  the strike, although I must say I have some sympathy for the  company's position. Surely the company has a right to 

 negotiate with their workers about some of these over-award  terms and conditions, which is a quite separate issue as to  whether it continues to deal with a union on a continuing  basis, if you like.  But you'vi got to have some sympathy for 

 their position in this dispute at this time.

 Jrnlst: ·

 Dr Hewson, that's not a view shared by Ray Groom, your Liberal  colleague in Tasmania, is it?

 REF: TRANSCR.\NM\S0091 5.

 Hewson:

 Apparently it's not,  no. ,

 Jrnlst:

 Well, he says he's lost patience with the company and that  they've handled it the wrong way. Is there a contradiction  there in the way you would approach industrial relations and  they way he's approaching it? . . .

 Hewson:

 You can't put me into that dispute.  I'm not involved in that  dispute, and I don't have Ray Groom's platform in that 

 dispute. But I must say that from the way I see that dispute, I'm surprised.  I'm surprised, quite frankly,"  that he hasn't  given the company more support in its right to deal with its  workers on over-award terms and conditions.

 Jrnlst: '  .  ,·

 So you're saying the company is going about Its industrial  relations the right way and the way that you would like to see ,   other companies...

 Hewson:

 No. You can't generalise like that.  I know it's tempting for  you to generalise like that,  but you can't...

 Jrnlst:  '

 Well, where do you stand on industrial relations in this  country7

 Hewson:

 Our view is that we should have the circumstance where 

 employers, and their employees can sit down, with or without a  union, and negotiate most terms and conditions of employment.   We've set out a very detailed industrial relations policy in  the past which we're currently in the process of extending.

 But in the context of certain minimum wages and other 

 conditions, they should be free to negotiate a whole range of  terms and conditions.

 If there are certain over-award payments that are unjustified  in the circumstances of the industry or the circumstances of  the market in which they operate at a particular time, they  ought to be able to sit down and negotiate those terms and .   conditions.  Now that is our approach.  Don't generalise from

 one particular dispute in one particular part of the country,  which has arisen for a host of reasons, apart from.  .  .  some we

 I

 REF x T R A N S C R \NM\S Î 091 6.

 know of, some we don't I imagine,  But I would like to see an  industrial relations system where they can sit down and  negotiate in relation to all, those terms and conditions, and  there's to be an orderly process about that - a series of 

 employment agreements, if you like,  which is the essence of  our policy, which will summarise the terms and conditions on  which they agree.

 Jrnlst: *

 Under your policy Dr Hewson, this sort of thing would be 

 happening a lot more though, wouldn't it? .

 Hewson: *

 No. Not at all.  :

 Jrnlst:

 Negotiating with your workers outside the existing structure? 

 Hewson:

 But because they both would think it's mutually beneficial td  do that. And that's the essence of our approach to industrial  relations.  You shouldn't baulk at this. It happens already  in Australia to a widespread extent in a lot of other 

 industries that haven't been traditionally unionised, or that  haven't been part of the centralised system - haven't opted to  be part of the centralised system. And I think over time most  employers and employees would opt out of the centralised 

 system.  And in other countries of course,  it happens all the  time. It's the only way it happens,  and they don't jump up in  the air and say "Gosh, look this is doom and disaster", 

 because it isn't.

 You're looking at a set of circumstances that is mutually  beneficial to both the company and the employee.  You saw it,  as a good example,  in the SPC case, where the workers said  straight out ’ "We are happy to forego certain terms and  conditions - leave loading, Saturdays,  rostered days off, whatever it was, in order to keep our job" .  They negotiated 

 an alternative package which has been beneficial to them.  They're better off. Not only do they have their job, but 

 they're now getting profitshares.  .  The company has turned around.  The company's performance has improved.  We're still  exporting, so the nation's better off.  The company's better  off. The employees are better off.

 Now that's the basic thrust of our industrial relations  policy. But it's hard to play the hypothetical game and say  "Well let's drop Hewson into the APPM dispute and see whether  we can crucify him on some element of that", because it's not 

 appropriate.  But I must say, you ask me for a reaction. My

 REF: TRANSCR\NM\S0091 7.

 reaction is I'm surprised the company hasn't had more support  in terms of its right to negotiate with its workers on some of  these terms and conditions^. Look, I think the union seems to  be standing a hard-line ground, defending its position at all  costs as the only way in which negotiations can take place.  I  mean, the workers may not want that.

 Jrnlst;

 If then, you get the chance to implement your industrial  relations policy, how are you going to get around this 

 stringent unionism as opposed to enterprise bargaining?

 Hewson:

 Well, we're going to break down compulsory unionism. We're  going to outlaw it. And we're going to give people the right  to choose who does the negotiation for them - whether they  negotiate themselves, or whether they have a union negotiate  on their behalf. We're going to institutionalise that 

 structure and we're going to put it under common law so that  the employer and the employee have equal common law rights, if  you like, so that if there's wrongful action by an employer,  an employee can take them to court, or vice versa.

 That establishes a common base. It establishes a fair base on  which those negotiations can take place,  But there'll be no  compulsory unionism. There'll be formal structures whereby  they can form an enterprise union if they want,  rather than 

 one of the existing unions,  but they can form an enterprise  union or a plant union specifically for the purposes of those  negotiations.  They are significant institutional changes.   It's not an anti-union policy but it is designed to ensure 

 that a union does what it ought to do if it's involved in that  process,  and that's represent the interests of workers at the  workplace, leaving the workers the right themselves to  represent their own interests if they choose.

 Jrnlst:

 Doesn't this show though, that enterprise bargaining can break  down? Here's a classic example of a group of workers who want  to negotiate with their union and a company who doesn't want  to negotiate with their union,  and they're at a stalemate.   What's the solution there?

 Hewson:

 Well again, you're trying to drag our policy into a specific  situation.  No, it is wrong to drag our policy into that 

 situation.  I'm not in Government.

 .  REF: T R A N S C R \ N M \ S 0 0 9 1 8.

 Jrnlst:

 ...inaudible...

 Hewson:

 No I'm not. I mean, this dispute will be solved long before  we get into Government - at least I certainly hope so.

 Jrnlst:

 But this situation will arise again when you're in Government,  won't they?

 Hewson:

 Yes, but the rules will be different. You'll have a different  institutional structure. They'll be operating under common  law. They'll be operating... if they've opted out of the 

 system, they'll be operating on a common law basis, which is a  completely different approach. They'll be on an equal 

 footing. They'll have rights. They'll have capacity to  negotiate directly or indirectly. I mean, that will all change. So as I say, you just can't say...force me into this  centralised system and say, you know, "make me make my system  work in there", because that's not fair.

 But you allow me to build the institutional structure and the  legal structure that I need to do it, and I'm happy to say 

 that these disputes probably won't occur, because they will be  negotiating at the workplace level. They'll be differences of  opinion, but they work them out to their mutual advantage.

 There's this simplistic notion around these days that 

 employers want to exploit workers and workers have got to be  protected and only unions can protect them. I mean, they are  19th century Victorian values. They don't apply any more.  Genuine companies are very interested in their workforce.  They put a lot of time into person management. They put a lot  of time ipto training. When they've got good staff they want 

 to keep their staff. They don't want to exploit their staff.  They want to have a fair go. They want to have a fair sharing  of the output, if you like, the' benefits of the output. 

 Equally, workers are keen to be part of it. They like the 

 idea of having a profitshare. They like the idea of having  equity in the company. They like the idea of being rewarded  for performance.

 These things naturally come together. It's not them and us  anymore. It is possible, if you change the institutional  structure, that they will actually sit down and negotiate to  their mutual advantage, and these stand-off situations which  emerge under the centralised system - don't forget this is the  centralised system that's breaking down. This is not Hewson's

 REF I  TRANSCR\NM\S0091 9.

 system.  It's not in place. This is the centralised system  that's breaking down. It's breaking down under that system.  The Government claims to be going to enterprise bargaining.  It's not working. You should be attacking the Government on  what's happening today, an actual situation, not attacking me 

 on what you think might happen under us in what is only a 

 hypothetical situation today.

 Our situation...we'11 create the rules and circumstances in  which those negotiations can take place, and I have every  confidence, on the basis of evidence I've seen in Australia  where it's happened, or in other countries around the world, 

 that it can happen to the best interests of both the employer  and the employee.

 Jrnlst:

 Surely it's going to be a difficult task to convince workers  that it should come out of the centralised wages system?

 Hewson:

 No. You should have gone down to SPC with me. I mean, there  was one woman stood up there with...

 Jrnlst:

 That's an isolated case...

 Hewson:

 Hang on, it's not an isolated case. I think it's indicative  of a worker attitude that's happened all over the place. When  the deregulated the financial system, that was a unionised  system and people said "well look, we can go ahead and 

 negotiate with these new banks and these new institutions. We  don't need the union." The workers made their own choices  themselves, and I didn't hear anyone complaining. When the unions actually tried to sign people up, they didn't1  

 particularly want to be members of the union. in fact, I”  1 think the membership of the ABEU,  as a union, fell 

 dramatically in the last half of the 1980s because they were  seen not to be representing the best interests of their 

 workers.  .

 And I'll tell you what - there are a lot of rank and file 

 unionists today, union members today, who are teed off with  the fact that the union leadership hasn't looked after their  interests. I haven't seen too many union leaders lose their  jobs, for example, but a hell of a lot of the rank and file 

 have lost their jobs. There's a growing feeling at the 

 workplace level that union leaders have not acted in their  best interests.

 REF: TRANSCR\NM\S0091 10 .

 Right now you have a debate about the Superannuation Guarantee  Levy - a deal done between Bill Kelty on the one hand and Paul  Keating on the other that's going to cost up to 100,000 rank  and file members their jobs. That's hardly in their best 

 interests. It's undeliverable in those terms. If it doesn't  cost them their job*, as the Treasury's admitted, they'll have  to take a cut in wages. They won't get another real wage 

 increase this decade. None of that's in their interests  either, and that's what people are feeling at the workplace  level.

 And as I say, time is right for a fundamental change in our  industrial relations system. It's never been a better time, i  think, to achieve fundamental change than we have right now.

 Jrnlst:  .

 Dr Hewson, just on the WA Inc situation and the Graham 

 Richardson affair - what's your major concern with the 

 Government's handling of these two issues?

 Hewson:

 Well, it's the "two nation" strategy. I mean, Paul Keating in  relation to Richardson - he has his own rules for Richardson,  and he has his own rules for everybody else. He looks after a  mate. He puts mateship ahead of leadership. In WA Inc he's 

 looking after other mates and he's distinguishing between  those mates and the rest of us. It's the "two nation" 

 strategy - consciously protecting mates and putting mateship  above leadership at a time where, as I say, he's got several  leadership tests on the drawing board today. He's got Richo.  He's got WA Inc. He's got the immigration situation. He's  got the deficit blowout which blows his One Nation package  right out the door, and where's Paul Keating?

 Jrnlst:

 Dr Hewson, what do you think about Kerry Packer organising an  exclusive golf game for Senator Richardson while negotiating  with him bn Pay TV?

 Hewson:

 Well, I don't know for a fact that that's happened. There's  been a bit of newspaper speculation about that.

 Jrnlst:

 It has happened. What would you say about that?

 Hewson:

 It's just a question to ask Senator Richardson.

 REF: TRANSCR.\NM\S0091 11.

 Jrnlst:

 Will you be asking that question?

 Hewson:

 We could well ask Senator Richardson a lot more questions, I  can assure you. In fact, every time Senator Richardson opens  his mouth, you get more questions, you don't get more answers.

 Ends.
