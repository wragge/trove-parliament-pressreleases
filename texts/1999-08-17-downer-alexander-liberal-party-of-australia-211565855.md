  MINE AWARENESS TRAINING FOR KOSOVO RETURNEES

  

  I am pleased to announce that Australia will help provide landmine 
awareness training for people in Kosovo and for Kosovar ev acuees 
in Australia before they return to their homeland. 

  

 Returning Kosovars are in danger of death and injury 
from landmines, cluster bombs and booby traps. People have died as they 
work on their farms, collect water or walk through their village. More 
than half the casualties are young people, with almost one-third of 
them children less than 4 years of age.

  

 In an effort to reduce the high number of casualties 
Australia will help educate people about the dangers of landmines and 
unexploded ordnance (UXO) through the UN Mine Action Service (UNMAS). 
UNMAS has responsibility for the implementation of an integrated Mine 
Action Program in Kosovo. It has established a Mine Action Coordinating 
Centre in Pristina for the planning and coordination of mine/UXO related 
activities including surveying, mine marking, mine awareness education 
and mine/UXO clearance.

  

 Kosovar refugees departing Australia immediately are 
receiving basic mine awareness training. More comprehensive training 
will be provided to the rest prior to their return. It is intended that 
two to three people from each safe haven will be trained as trainers. 
They will then run training courses within the havens as well as within 
their communities following their return to Kosovo, helping others avoid 
the dangers of landmines and unexploded bombs.

  

 Australia will provide $420,000 to UNMAS, and $80,000 
for training of Kosovar refugees in Australia.

  

 This new assistance is additional to the $6 million 
already provided for humanitarian assistance in Kosovo. It will be provided 
through the Australian Government’s overseas aid agency, AusAID, as 
part of its emergency and humanitarian relief operations.
