 No: MDC 38 Date: 26 July 1993$300 000 FOOD RELIEF FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIAAustralia will provide $300 000 to the World Food Programme (WFP) for food relief in the former Yugoslavia, the Minister for Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney, said today.The announcement coincides with the visit to Australia by the World Food Programme's Executive Director, Catherine Bertini."It is an appalling fact that the conflict in the former Yugoslavia has affected millions of people, "Mr Bilney said."Australia is pleased to be able to play a part in assisting the World Food Programme in its goal of feeding 3.8 million people by December this year."Due to the cost of transport, and the availability of food closer to the former Yugoslavia, it is more economical and efficient to provide financial support to WFP instead of sending Australian food," Mr Bilney said.The Australian funds will be used by the WFP in securing and supplying food shipments to depots in the former Yugoslavia.The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (LJNHCR) and its partners will then arrange transport of the food to the people in most need.In November 1992 the WFP assumed responsibility for mobilising food supplies to the former Yugoslavia for displaced people and refugees.Earlier this year the WFP launched an international appeal to secure 526,153 tons of basic and supplementary food.Since September 1991 the Australian Government has provided $1.85 million, throughthe Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB), for emergency relief efforts in the former Yugoslavia. The bulk of the funds have been provided through United Nations agencies and the International Committee of the Red Cross.CANBERRAFor further information contact:Richard Moore (Minister's Office) 06 277 7660 David Jones (AIDAB) 06 276 4967COMMONWEALTHPARLIAMENTARY LIBRARYMICAH
