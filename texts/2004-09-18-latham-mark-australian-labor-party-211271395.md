 FEDERAL LABOR LEADER  MARK LATHAM   

 

 WEST AUSTRALIAN CAMPAIGN LAUNCH 

 

 CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY 

 

 We assemble today for the launch of our Western Australian 

 campaign, but also to pay our respects to two Labor candidates, 

 two great Labor fighters who are no longer with us. 

 

 We honour the service and memory of Kevin Richards and Jane 

 Gerrick.  We pay tribute to their compassion and their belief in a 

 better Australia. 

 

 And the best way of honouring their work is to finish the campaigns 

 they started - to bring Kalgoorlie and Canning back to the ALP.  

 That’s why I’m so pleased that two experienced community 

 campaigners, two fine public representatives in Tom Stephens and 

 Kay Hallahan are running in these electorates. 

 

  1

 I’m optimistic about the things we can achieve for Western 

 Australia, with a positive approach, with good policies and a clear 

 plan for the future.  This is my sort of place. 

 

 Back in Sydney they sometimes call me a ‘Westie’, because I’m 

 from Green Valley, in the Western Suburbs. 

 

 That West may be my home, but this West has given me another 

 family home - a place of love and partnership in life. 

 

 I like this State so much I married into it.  And people here have 

 been congratulating me on my good judgement and good fortune 

 ever since. 

 

 In government I won’t just have Janine’s  family urging pro-Western Australian policies, I’ll have a great WA parliamentary 

 team. 

 

 A parliamentary team that includes our first ever female and 

 directly elected National President, Carmen Lawrence. 

 

 A team that includes Stephen Smith, with an immigration policy 

 that both protects our borders and treats genuine asylum seekers 

 fairly.  Getting the children out from behind the razor wire - a 

 measure of our commitment to a civilised society. 

 

 National Security 

 

  2

 And I’ll also have Labor’s front bench defence team, backing the 

 work of our armed forces: Chris Evans, Mark Bishop and Graham 

 Edwards.  Led by a man with more than 20 years of service 

 defending our great country, Kim Beazley.  Kim knows what it 

 takes to manage our alliances, guard our coastlines and protect 

 Australia from the threat of terrorism. 

 

 With a long and sparsely inhabited coast line, West Australians 

 understand the need for strong defences.  You are, after all, the 

 State that elected John Curtin to our national parliament. 

 

 So it’s more than coincidence that Labor’s defence team is all 

 West Australian. 

 

 We recognise the supreme importance to the West and its 

 economy of our armed forces, so wisely positioned here by Kim 

 Beazley as Defence Minister in the Hawke Government. 

 

 Those 4,300 full-time Defence personnel, 3,000 contractors and 

 20,000 related employees add more than a billion dollars to the 

 State’s economy every year.   

 

 Labor’s Coast Guard policy is of particular importance to the West, 

 given the risk of people smuggling, illegal fishing and attacks on 

 resource projects. 

 

 Our fleet of 16 Coast Guard vessels with helicopter capacity, will 

 move in and out of W.A bases and ports.  Places like Broome, Port 

 Hedland, and Dampier, where they will need provisioning, 

  3

 maintenance and crews, creating local jobs and economic 

 development. 

 

 All the new vessels will be built here in Australia.  And this State, 

 with its expertise in producing patrol boats, will be competitive in 

 securing the contracts. 

 

 The 12 new Armidale Class patrol boats being built by Austal at 

 Henderson Yard, will offer new capacity for surveillance, 

 interception and boarding of illegal vessels. 

 

 Our Coast Guard will also free up these ships and other naval 

 assets to take part, along with our P3 Orions, in the fight against 

 J.I and other terrorist organisations in the waters to our North.  

 They will also protect the critical resource assets on the North 

 West shelf.  Taken together, this new capacity represents a 

 significant boost to Australia’s national security. 

 

 It embodies the principle that shapes Labor's approach to 

 combatting terrorism: the frontline of Australia's War on Terror is 

 our own region. 

 

 This is the best approach for fighting the bombers of Bali and 

 Jakarta: not repeating the mistakes of Iraq, not making ourselves 

 less safe in the war against terror; but identifying and eliminating 

 the terrorists, breaking up and destroying al Qaeda and J.I. at 

 source. 

 

  4

 We have to get it right in our part of the world.  This is where our 

 permanent interests lie: security on the homefront, security in Asia.  

 It’s a matter of life and death.  And it’s bound to be a long and 

 difficult fight. 

 

 It needs a commitment to see the job through to the end.  This is 

 not the time for half-measures and half-service.  This is where Mr 

 Howard has been so nervy and indecisive - he won’t give a 

 commitment to the Australian people, to our nation, that he’s in for 

 the long haul, the long fight against terrorism.   

 

 He’s cutting and running into retirement.  That’s the big difference 

 in this campaign.  Mr Howard is ready to leave.  I’m ready to lead 

 our nation, to take on the fight against evil, in the war against 

 terror. 

 

 I’m 43 years of age.  I’m in the prime of my life.  And I make this 

 promise to the nation that my Liberal opponent won’t make: if you 

 elect me as Prime Minister, I will see the fight against terror 

 through to the end, securing the safety of the Australian people. 

 

 W.A. - the economic powerhouse  

 

 Mr Howard says he’s standing on his record.  But that’s like saying 

 to the public: this is as good as it gets. 

 

 Well, I’m more optimistic than that.  There are so many more 

 things we can do as a nation, so many problems to solve: 

 improvements to our economy and family finances, to the 

  5

 environment, to our essential community services in health and 

 education. 

 

 Mr Howard’s record is in the past.  Labor’s plan is about the future. 

 

 Western Australia isn’t just critical to our defence and security, it’s 

 absolutely vital to our economic future.   This is why I want to work 

 in partnership with State Labor, securing more development, more 

 projects, more job opportunities for the West. 

 

 Earlier this year I went with Geoff Gallop to inspect Barrow Island, 

 and the great developments on the North West Shelf and at Port 

 Hedland. 

 

 These are huge and inspiring projects.  They rely on public 

 investment to create road, rail and social infrastructure.  Federal 

 Labor understands the contribution of West Australian taxpayers to 

 these developments and the nation’s finances.  We particularly 

 appreciate the massive contribution to the Commonwealth through 

 company taxes and resource royalties. 

 

 This revenue will increase even further as the massive Gorgon gas 

 project comes on line.  And I want to thank the people of the West 

 with more than just words. 

 

 That’s why today I can announce that a Labor Government will 

 ensure a proportion of Commonwealth resource rent tax from the 

 Gorgon development is returned to the West Australian people.  

 The revenue will be deposited into a dedicated Western Australian 

  6

 Resources Infrastructure Fund, jointly administered by the 

 Commonwealth and the State Government. 

 

 This recognises that just as the whole nation will share in the 

 benefits of the Gorgon venture, the whole nation should contribute 

 to the infrastructure needed to build it - and other great projects 

 like it.  Our policy will deliver a fairer deal for WA taxpayers - up to 

 $75 million a year for the development of the State. 

 

 And to encourage more minerals exploration, Labor will implement 

 a new, flow-through share scheme.  This will allow exploration 

 expenditure by small entrepreneurial mining companies to be 

 passed on to equity investors to deduct against their income.  It’s a 

 real incentive for further investment in the resource sector. 

 

 On the subject of infrastructure, let me also confirm that a Labor 

 Government will help with a number of important road projects 

 here in Perth, including our commitment of $170 million to the 

 construction of the Mandurah Bypass - completing the Perth to 

 Bunbury Highway.   

 

 We’ll also provide $6 million for the Reid Highway/Mirrabooka 

 Avenue Overpass, and a further $6 million to extend Lloyd Street 

 to the Great Eastern Highway Bypass.   

 

 

 The environment 

 

  7

 These are important projects.  And they are matched by Labor’s 

 commitment to develop our economy in a sustainable way.  As 

 Prime Minister, I will be working with all levels of government 

 through COAG to protect and repair the environment. 

 

 We’ll begin by taking the step the Howard Government refuses to 

 take:  Labor will ratify the Kyoto Protocol to help combat global 

 warming. 

 

 Around the country, tourism operators have told me that this is vital 

 for the future of their industry - to stop coral bleaching, to protect 

 our national parks, to preserve our magnificent coastline.  Climate 

 change threatens our economy because it threatens our natural 

 assets. 

 

 This is why Labor has always been a party for the environment - 

 promoting the need for sustainable development. 

 

 Here in the West, we’ll nominate more coastal areas for protection 

 under World Heritage listing, including Ningaloo Reef - one of the 

 few remaining great coral reefs in the world.   

 

 Labor will also invest more in the protection of the State’s beaches 

 and rivers, including $4.5 million to continue the restoration of the 

 Swan and Canning Rivers. 

 

 And we’ll make available $210,000 of seed funding to the Dorothy 

 Henderson Eco Centre in Perth to provide information, education 

 and demonstration projects in all aspects of urban sustainability.

 Rewarding hard work and taking the pressure off families 

 

 There’s no doubt Western Australia is the powerhouse of our 

 nation’s prosperity.  But I want to ask you a question - one 

 Australians have been asking me in every corner of the country.  Is 

 our prosperity being used as well as it could be, is it being put to a 

 good social purpose by the Howard Government? 

 

 So often Mr Howard and Mr Costello act as if Australia’s economy 

 and wealth belongs to them.  That everything that happens is 

 because of them. 

 

 Well, I say that the Australian economy belongs to the Australian 

 people.  It’s success comes from the effort and enterprise of the 

 workers and our businesspeople.  It doesn’t belong to the 

 politicians. 

 

 The best thing we can do in public life is to reward the hard 

 workers and entrepreneurs.  To give them greater incentive, to 

 keep on building the productivity and wealth of the nation.  It’s their 

 economy, let’s back their efforts. 

 

 Australians have told me they were shocked, absolutely shocked, 

 on Budget night to discover that the vast majority of taxpayers - 

 the hard workers on 30, 40 and 50,000 dollars a year -got nothing.  

 Not one red cent of tax relief.   Not one ounce of economic 

 incentive. 

  9

 

 In the seat of Kalgoorlie 80 percent of taxpayers missed out on a 

 tax cut.  In Perth, 89 percent.  In Stirling, Swan and Canning, the 

 figure was 90 percent.  In Cowan, 91 percent.  And in Hasluck, 92 

 percent of taxpayers got dudded. 

 

 Labor won’t tolerate such an unfair tax system.  We want to ease 

 the squeeze, reward hard work and take the pressure off families. 

 

 Under Labor all those Australians earning under $52,000 a year 

 will get a tax cut of up to $8 a week - $416 a year.   

 

 With the rising cost of buying a home and raising a family, people 

 earning over $80,000 a year also need incentive, so under Labor 

 they will receive tax relief as well. 

 

 Our plan will also help families through a better family payments 

 system.  Combining payments into one simpler scheme and 

 raising the point at which the means test starts from $33,000 to 

 $50,000.  For a typical middle Australian family, this means an 

 extra $70-80 a week.   

 

 We’ll also overcome the family debts crisis which has harmed 1.4 

 million Australian families.  We’ll end the nightmare of having to 

 haggle with Centrelink about undeserved debts to the government. 

 

 And for the disadvantaged, our plan offers new opportunities in life.  

 We need to confront the problem of 800,000 Australian children 

 growing up in jobless households.  We know what this leads to: 

  10

 poverty, poor health, increased crime rates and, worst of all, lack 

 of hope.  This is the national shame we face under the Howard 

 Government. 

 

 There are three answers to this problem: participation, participation 

 and more participation.  By lowering effective marginal tax rates 

 we can bring more people into the labour market and give our 

 young people the best example they need in their lives - parents 

 who work. 

 

 So if you want to know what our tax plan means in one line, it’s 

 this: fairness, aspiration and participation.  A fairer go for 

 Australian families. 

 

 Education Policy 

 

 For me, one of the most important rungs in the ladder of 

 opportunity is education.  I know from my own life the power of 

 good schools and affordable universities.   

 

 I also know the importance of early childhood development.  

 Learning doesn’t start the first day of school, it starts the first day 

 of life.  And we need more research and awareness of the best 

 way to foster the early years of learning and development. 

 

 This is why Labor will back the outstanding work of Professor 

 Fiona Stanley and her Australian Research Alliance for Children 

 and Health with an extra $12 million in funding for this discipline -increasing our understanding of the causes of behavioural and 

  11

 other learning problems.  Early intervention is the key to 

 excellence in education.  Under Labor’s plan, Perth will lead the 

 nation and the world through a National Centre for Excellence in 

 Childhood Development. 

 

 This State has fine government and non-government schools, plus 

 universities with some of the highest tertiary entrance scores in the 

 country.  With increased investment we can create even more 

 opportunities at every level. 

 

 On Tuesday I announced our funding plan for schools.  It’s based 

 on a simple principle: every child deserves the same chance in life 

 of receiving a quality education. 

 

 Yesterday I went with Janine to visit her old school, East Kenwick 

 Primary.  We want every Australian child to have the same 

 advantage we enjoyed early in life - the great start provided by a 

 well-resourced neighbourhood school. 

 

 I support the right of parents to determine the best school for their 

 children, but they should never be forced to choose between a first 

 rate and a second rate education. 

 

 Labor will ensure that every Australian school meets our new 21st 

 Century Resource Standard.  Nineteen out of 20 students will be 

 better off - increased funding for an extra 9,500 schools. 

 

 Labor will invest an additional $2.4 billion in school education - 

 including $1.9 billion in new funding for public schools and $520 

  12

 million redirected from high-fee private schools to lift up needy 

 Catholic, Christian and independent schools - more funding for an 

 extra 2,500 non-government schools.   

 

 Government schools in Western Australia will benefit significantly 

 from Labor’s funding boost.  Labor regards public education as a 

 national priority. 

 

 Of course, we’re already hearing the usual dishonest scare 

 campaign from Mr Howard about our schools policy.  He’s only got 

 one tactic in this campaign and that’s a scare tactic.  He’s run out 

 of positive things to say to the Australian people. 

 

 Labor has a positive plan, a fairer plan for private schools: 

 

 â¢ We will maintain the overall level of funding for non-government schools but with a fairer distribution of money 

 within the sector, based on need. 

 

 â¢ Under our package, schools in Western Australia will gain an 

 extra $241 million over the next five years, including $52 

 million for non-government schools.  155 Catholic schools 

 and another 115 private schools in this State will be better 

 off.  That’s equity in action. 

 

 Schools like Sydney’s King’s School and Geelong Grammar in 

 Victoria, with their high fees, unmatched facilities and huge 

 endowments will have their funding redirected to help Catholic and 

 other non-government schools in greater need - many of them in 

  13

 this State.  This is what Labor stands for: educational opportunity 

 for all. 

 

 And when those young people finish school, I don’t want to see a 

 single one dissuaded from going on to post-secondary education  

 by the crippling fees and under-investment of the Howard 

 Government. 

 

 Under our plan, universities and TAFE colleges in Western 

 Australia will get their fair share of the 40,000 new places under a 

 Labor Government. 

 

 Our policy will address the growing need in WA’s extraction and 

 infrastructure industries for more skilled engineers and 

 tradespeople, as well as the need for more doctors and nurses in 

 our public hospitals and communities. 

 

 And we will reverse the Howard Government’s 25 percent increase 

 in HECS and abolish it’s full-fee system. 

 

 Before the last election, Mr Howard denied he was planning to 

 create $100,000 degrees.  Now there are nearly 50 courses that 

 cost that much.  It must have been a non-core promise. 

 

 There will be no $100,000 degrees at our universities under a 

 Labor Government.  Access to education will be on merit and hard 

 work, not parental wealth.  That’s the Australian way.  That’s the 

 Labor policy. 

 

  14

 Health Policy 

 

 Mr Howard’s plans for education are all about creating a user-pays 

 system.  It’s the same principle that drives his health policies. 

 

 He wants to set up a two-tiered health system.  That’s something I 

 will never accept.  Because if you're in the second tier, you end up 

 with a second-class safety net, a second-class service.  

 

 My policy is simple.  I believe in Medicare.  One tier, one world-class health system for all Australians.  And we'll never walk away 

 from that commitment.  We set up this system, we're proud of it, 

 and we're going to bring it back to its full health. 

 

 Under Mr Howard, bulk billing has fallen from 80 to 70 percent.  

 Here in the West it’s fallen to just 63 percent. 

 

 Labor will get the national bulk billing rate back up to 80 percent by 

 paying doctors 100 percent of the scheduled fee when they bulk 

 bill patients and by sending Medicare Teams of bulk billing doctors 

 and nurses into communities where rates are low. 

 

 We will provide incentive payments of $7,500 per year for doctors 

 in metropolitan areas who bulk bill 80 per cent of their patients. 

 

 And in rural and remote areas, doctors who bulk bill 70 percent of 

 their patients will get an extra $22,500. 

 

  15

 This will lift the average patient rebate for doctors in Perth, Stirling, 

 and Joondalup who reach the bulk billing target by an additional 

 $6.30, and in Kalgoorlie and Port Hedland by $9.60. 

 

 These are powerful incentives that will restore the centrepiece of 

 Medicare - access to a bulk-billing doctor. 

 

 And to help people better access the health system, Labor will 

 open a new Medicare Office in Belmont. 

 

 In Western Australia, there is also a shortage of medical staff.  

 Importing hundreds of doctors from overseas is just a band aid 

 solution, especially when we’re turning students  away from 

 medicine and nursing in our universities.  So Labor will train more 

 doctors and nurses to serve the people of Western Australia. 

 

 Together with our improvements to aged care funding, our policies 

 will ease the pressure on the public hospital system and help cut 

 waiting lists. 

 

 And in government, we’ll do something that should have been 

 done long ago - we’ll help the 500,000 Australians on waiting lists 

 to get their teeth fixed up through our new Australian Dental Care 

 program.  We should honour our senior citizens and their service 

 to Australia through a world class dental and health service. 

 

 That’s why Labor established Medibank and then Medicare.  And 

 now only Labor will save the system: our belief in universality, our 

 commitment to the health care of all Australians. 

  16

 

 Conclusion - a new era of national cooperation, a new 

 government 

 

 Each of these plans: 

 

 - defending our borders and our people, 

 - securing more resource projects for the State, 

 - giving W.A. taxpayers a fair go, 

 -  providing  more  opportunities for our young people, 

 - honouring our senior citizens, 

 - protecting the environment, 

 - and rebuilding Medicare. 

 

 need two things above all else.   

 

 The first is a new era of national cooperation.  That’s what this 

 election represents - the historic opportunity of ending the buck 

 passing between Canberra and the States and tackling the big 

 problems head on.  Problem solving for the public, rather than 

 blame shifting by politicians. 

 

 It’s what the Australian people want, and only Labor believes in it. 

 

 But you can’t have cooperative federalism without the second part 

 of this equation: 

 

 - the election of a new Labor Government on 9th October.  

 

  17

 There’s three weeks to go in this marathon campaign. 

 

 Three weeks ‘till the promise of a better, fairer and stronger 

 Australia can become a reality. 

 

 So let’s double our efforts in the service of the country we love, for 

 the people who need our help - the hard workers and families, the 

 suburbs and regions that rely on the election of a Labor 

 Government. 

 

 My aim is simple: to give Australia a government as good as the 

 Australian people themselves.  The people are honest and sincere.  

 They believe in hard work and opportunity.  They believe in a fair 

 go for all. 

 

 And that’s what I’m dedicated to achieving, with all the passion and 

 commitment I can muster as Prime Minister, as the head of an 

 Australian Labor Government - serving this State, serving the 

 people of our great nation.
