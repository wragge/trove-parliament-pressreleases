 JOINT PRESS RELEASE BY THE MINISTER FOR DEFENCE,  SENATOR ROBERT RAY AND THE ACTING MINISTER FOR  FOREIGN AFFAIRS, GORDON BILNEY MP

 MIN 40/95 23 May 1995

 AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE TO RWANDA

 The Government announced today that up to $5 million would be provided to  address health needs in Rwanda.

 In announcing the additional assistance the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Mr Gordon Bilney said, "The increased funding will build on the work of the  Australian Defence Force, addressing immunisation and HIV programs in 

 camps, the special needs of traumatised children and adults and the vital need  to re-establish basic health services throughout the country."

 The assistance will be delivered through international and non government  agencies.

 The Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, confirmed that the Australian  Medical contingent in the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda  (UNAMIR II) would be withdrawn in August 1995.

 Senator Ray said, "When Australia's contribution of some 300 ADF personnel  was announced in July 1994, the Government indicated that the force would  deploy for a finite period, initially of six months, with an option for a second 

 six month deployment. A second deployment commenced in February 1995."

 "Since arriving in Rwanda in August 1994, Australian troops have provided  outstanding medical support to the United Nations, as well as much needed  humanitarian assistance to thousands of Rwandan citizens, under difficult and 

 trying conditions."

 "Australians can be justly proud of the professionalism and dedication of our  young servicemen and women who have served in Rwanda," Senator Ray said.

 Mr Bilney said, "Australia has already provided more than $13.5 million  through AusAID - the Australian Agency for International Development, for the  Rwanda/Burundi emergency."

 This has provided emergency shelter, food and medical supplies and has  included resettlement assistance for displaced people who wish to return home.

 The assistance has been channelled through the United Nations World Food  Program, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNICEF and  Australian and international non government organisations.

 Mr Bilney said "This brings total Australian support for Rwanda/Burundi to  around $75 million, including about $18.5 million through AusAID, $25  million through the Australian Defence Force and $30 million from community  support for non government organisations."
