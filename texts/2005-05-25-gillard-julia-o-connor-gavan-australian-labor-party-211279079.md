 TRANSCRIPT DOORSTOP  PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA  8:15AM  25 MAY 2005   

 ISSUES:  Drought,  Rural  Financial  Counselling  Services,  mental  health,  broken  promise,   Privacy Commission, doctors selling patients records, detention centre Private Members Bill.   

 GAVAN  O’CONNOR:  Good  morning.  We  are  here  to  talk  about  the  impact  of  the  drought  on   farm families particularly subsequent mental health issues and personal issues.   

  As you know the drought is severe. 85 per cent of New South Wales is drought affected and  some  45  per  cent  of  Australia’s  land  mass  is  drought  declared  but  farmers  in  severe   financial stress need support services. It is estimated that in rural Australia every four days  one farmer looses his or her life or takes his or her life. That simply means that the time the  Prime  Minister  walked  the  soils  of  New  South  Wales  to  the  time  it  has  taken  to  deliver  his   package,  one  farmer  would  have  taken  their  life  in  rural  Australia.  This  is  an  extremely   serious situation.  

 

 The front line in the delivery of services to farmers is the Rural Financial Counselling Service.  This  is  a  service  which  has  had  difficulty  getting  funding  on  a  consistent  basis  from  the   Government. When farmers are in financial stress, the first port of call, after the bank is often  to  the  Rural  Financial  Counsellor  in  the  area.  They  know  farmers  and  farmers  have  their   confidence and they can access them. In those interviews of course the counsellors tell us   that farmers are referred onto other agencies, their families are referred onto other agencies,  because  behind  the  financial  difficulties,  often  there  personal,  quite  severe  personal   difficulties. This particular service has something like 85 counsellors and it services some 9  thousand  farmers  from  around  Australia  each  year.  It  has  had  severe  difficulty  getting   funding from this Government.    

 Indeed before the last election, Minister Truss was able to spend $6 million on promoting a  natural resources program but they couldn’t find $5 million to extend the life of this service. I  am calling on the Government, to put this service on a sound financial footing and to fund it  beyond  December  this  year.  The  impacts  of  the  drought  will  be  felt  beyond  the  end  of  the   year,  even  if  it  rains  in  winter  so  it  is  very  important  this  particular  service  is  funded.  The   issue  of  mental  health  was  in  part  bought  to  the  attention  of  the  broader  Australian   community  by  ex-Liberal  Victorian  Premier,  Jeff  Kennett  at  the  summit  in  Parkes.  It  is  a   deepening  situation  in  rural  Australia  for  drought  affected  farmers  and  their  families,  the   issue  of  mental  health  and  I  would  ask  the  Shadow  Minister  for  Health  to  comment  on   Government programs relating to this.   

 JULIA  GILLARD:  Thank you very much. Can I join with Gavan O’Connor on the call he has  made  today  but  there  is  a  second  thing  the  Government  should  do,  the  other  front  line   dealing  with  mental  health  issues,  dealing  with  depression,  with  stress,  even  with  suicidal   behaviour  out  there  in  rural  and  regional  Australia  is  of  course  the  general  practitioner.   People go to the GP when they are feeling unwell because of these mental health pressures.  and GP’s can offer mental health services but the program that enables them to do that, the  Better  Outcomes  for  Mental  Health  program,  has  been  the  subject  of  yet  another  John   Howard and Tony Abbott broken election promise. They promised in the election campaign to  increase the funding by $30 million, the Budget did not deliver that. It is $18 million short of  what was promised and we are calling today for Tony Abbott and John Howard to do nothing  more complicated than keeping their word and to fully deliver that extra $30 million. This is  money that goes into supporting GP’s on the front line to help with mental health issues and  as  Gavan  O’Connor  has  said  they  are  particularly  acute  in  drought  affected  areas  where   people are under an enormous about of stress.   

 On a second matter, the front page of today’s Herald Sun raises a very significant issue for  patients  of  doctors  right  around  Australia.  We  now  know  that  doctors  are  selling  patients   records  to  drug  companies.  They  claim  these  records  are  de-identified  but  the  privacy   commission in an earlier report has said that even de-identified records can be re-linked with  people’s identities. I don’t think patients of doctors want their personal details, any aspect of  their  health  and  health  conditions  being  sold  to  drug  companies.  This  is  something  the   Privacy  Commissioner  should  act  on  and  act  on  today  and  the  Government  should  ensure   that it is treated immediately as a serious privacy issue affecting Australian patients and get  on with the job of making sure patients’ details are fully and completely protected. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Is it actually illegal?   

 JULIA  GILLARD:  The  Privacy  Commissioner  has  said  that  it  is  not  illegal  but  it  clearly  raises   concerns. I think most  patients of Australian  doctors are probably pretty happy to have  de-identified  data  given  to  genuine  researchers  that  are  looking  to  try  to  cure  illness  and   disease but I think it is another thing entirely for their records to be sold to drug companies  so drug companies can work out better ways of marketing their drugs. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Julia,  from  a  mental  health  perspective,  should  Labor  support  these  Private   Members Bills that are being put forward by Petro Georgiou and co?   

 JULIA GILLARD: Well we are yet to see of course the detail of these Bills but from what I have  seen in the newspapers much of what is being suggested by Petro Georgiou is absolutely, on  all fours with Labor’s policy. For a number of years now we have been saying there is a better  way  to  deal  with  the  issues  of  asylum  seekers  and  refugees,  a  better  way  to  deal  with  

 children and  their families, a better way to fast track processing of claims  so that they  are   done in 90 days. That seems to be echoed by what Petro is saying and to the extent Petro is  echoing Labor policy, then certainly we would support it.   

 JOURNALIST: Are there tactics that you can use in the House that you can use to ensure that  this gets to see a vote one day?   

 JULIA  GILLARD:  I  think  the  very  first  thing  that  should  happen  is  that  John  Howard  should   extend to every Liberal Party Member a conscience vote on this issue.  END
