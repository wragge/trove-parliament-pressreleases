  Media Release

  

  OFFICE OF THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

  

 TRANSCRIPTION: PROOF COPY E&OE

 DATE: 6 APRIL 1999

 VENUE: PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA

  KOSOVO

  

  Mr Downer:

  

 Look I won’t be able to spend very long, but look 
I can really just repeat what I was saying on ABC radio this morning 
for you and that is that in relation to the two Australians who are 
missing in Yugoslavia we still remain very concerned about them. Our 
Ambassador as well as the senior officials from CARE Australia are still 
on the border between Croatia and Yugoslavia. The Ambassador has made 
a large number of contacts with Yugoslav authorities, he’s spoken 
with the Defence Minister, he’s spoke to the police, he’s spoken 
with the Foreign Ministry, he’s spoken with the Deputy Prime Minister’s 
office, he’s making contact with the Orthodox Church officials as 
well as the Catholic church, and with local Government officials as 
well, and I must say that we still don’t know where the two Australians 
are. We remain very concerned for their security and we will maintain 
every effort to try to track them down and get them out of Yugoslavia 
safely, but we do remain concerned about their whereabouts.

  

  Question:

  

 Malcolm Fraser.. .inaudible... believes that they 
are 30kms from the Croatian border and that they are being held there?

  

  Mr Downer:

  

 Well, yesterday we were given advice that there was 
a possibility that they may be in a village 30 or 40kms from the Croatian 
border. Our Ambassador though rang me late last night to tell me that 
they had made contact with officials in the village and no one in the 
village knew of the Australians, so I’m afraid what Mr Fraser heard 
yesterday was what I heard yesterday, but I’m afraid the news is not 
good, that on further investigation they are apparently not in the village. 
I’ve contacted Mr Fraser myself and passed on that news to him.

  

  Question:

  

 So another hope dashed?

  

  Mr Downer:

  

 Another hope dashed unfortunately yes. But we do remain 
seriously concerned about them, their safety and their whereabouts and 
really we just are doing everything we possibly can to find them. You 
can imagine what the environment is like there in Yugoslavia of course, 
that doesn’t need any description from me, but it is proving very 
hard to track them down.

  

  Question:

  

 Would Australia considering adding to the aid package 
(inaudible) you announced last week given the scale of the tragedy now?

  

  Mr Downer:

  

 The Prime Minister is going to have a bit more to 
say about that during the course of the day, but we certainly, when 
I made my announcement which I think off the top of my head was last 
Thursday about the aid package I did say that we’d provide an initial 
$2million to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, to CARE 
Australia, the Red Cross, and World Vision, but we keep open providing 
additional resources and clearly the situation has deteriorated dramatically 
even since that announcement so more needs to be done. The Prime Minister 
will have more to say about that.

  

  Question:

  

 Will there be any reconsideration of the Government’s 
attitude towards taking refugees as the situation unfolds?

  

  Mr Downer:

  

 That’s a matter that you should raise either with 
Philip Ruddock or with the Prime Minister.

  

  Question:

  

 Mr Fraser says that Australia should open its door 
up to 30,000 Kosovo refugees?

  

  Mr Downer:

  

 Right, well I can’t really add to that. Now somebody 
asked me a question about East Timor.

  

  Question:

  

 Xanana Gusmao.. .Inaudible. . .call to arms.. .inaudible...?

  

  Mr Downer:

  

 We have said all along that we wanted to see a process 
of reconciliation in Timor. We wanted to see a political settlement 
in East Timor. We obviously are very concerned about the level of violence 
which is still taking place in East Timor. We would urge people in East 
Timor to consider the implications of resorting to violence or using 
acts of violence to achieve their political objectives. East Timor’s 
future will only be secured if there is a political settlement and if 
people work through the differences that they have in a peaceful way. 
There is too much violence around the world for people to be able to 
ignore the consequences of any type of violence. The consequences are 
very obvious, and so we have called on the Indonesian Government privately 
and publicly not only to make sure that there are no ABRI officials 
or soldiers providing arms to paramilitaries, but to do what they can 
to ensure that the paramilitaries and others in East Timor are progressively 
disarmed. We would like to see that happen.

  

  Question:

  

 .. .Inaudible...?

  

  Mr Downer:

  

 Well, to achieve full disarmament in a short period 
of time has so far eluded Bertie Ahern and Tony Blair and others in 
Northern Ireland, and to achieve full disarmament in East Timor will 
be an enormous task, but nevertheless for as long as there are arms 
on the ground in East Timor we urge all of the parties, whichever party 
they may be, to act with restraint and to remember that violence begets 
violence and East Timor will have a very unhappy future if it follows 
the path of violence.

  

  Question:

  

 How irresponsible was Gusmao’s call .inaudible...?

  

  Mr Downer:

  

 Well I’m not saying that was an irresponsible call, 
I’m just saying, and indeed it’s very unhelpful, I think, for any 
of us here in Australia to get into a lot of name calling in relation 
to the different participants to the East Timer dispute. You know, some 
people are very partisan one way or the other about this issue. The 
important thing is to keep working at the reconciliation process. This 
is a set back, there will be many more set backs in the future. There 
will be good days, there will be days when progress has been made, there 
will be days like this when there’s a step taken backwards. The important 
thing though is to retain, from our perspective of Australia, the important 
this is to retain our vigilant approach to encouraging a peaceful outcome, 
to do what we can working very closely with the United Nations to try 
to help with the process of reconciliation and reconstruction in East 
Timor. It will be difficult and we shouldn’t overreact every time 
there is a difficulty.

  

  Question:

  

 But don’t you think Xanana’s call has in fact 
stopped the peace and reconciliation process, that you support, dead 
in its tracks?

  

  Mr Downer:

  

 No, of course it hasn’t, I mean, that is, if I may 
say so, a very substantial overstatement. As I said, it’s important 
to understand this throughout all of these types of disputes wherever 
they are in the world, there are good days and bad days and we still 
believe that with the United Nations playing a leadership role, and 
with goodwill from Jakarta and goodwill from the pro independence factions 
as well outside of East Timor, it will be possible to achieve a peaceful 
settlement to the East Timor problem. It isn’t in Australia’s interest, 
nor is it in the interest of Indonesia or the people of East Timor to 
argue in a way that will only inflame violence and the violent outcome 
to this difficult process. But this is a very delicate process.

  

  Question:

  

 Would the latest developments boost the demand for 
a UN peacekeeping force to go in?

  

  Mr Downer:

  

 Well, I have answered that question over and over 
again, and made some comments about it that you might like to read through 
again, during the course of last week at the National Press Club.

  

  Question:

  

 Does it promote the case for it?

  

  Mr Downer :

  

 Well, this doesn’t change any of the considerations 
that the United Nations, that Australia, that the international community 
as a whole take into account. The United Nations and Australia and most 
thinking parties to this issue have exactly the same approach to a peacekeeping 
operation. In any case you can’t just send in a peacekeeping operation 
with all the glibness of an opposition politician and put out a press 
release saying send in a peaekeeping operation. East Timor is controlled 
by Jakarta, by Indonesia, they would obviously have to agree to it, 
unless you wanted to go to war with Indonesia, and that isn’t on our 
agenda.
