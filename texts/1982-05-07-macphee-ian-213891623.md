 ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL AID FOR THE MONASTERY REFUGEE PROJECT

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic A f f a i r s M r Ian Macphee,   announced today an additional grant of $8,000 to the Monastery ·   Refugee Project (MRP) in Glen Osmond, South Australia. '

 "This will bring the Commonwealth's contribution to the program  to $32,000",· Mr Macphee said.  "In September 1981, I approved  a grant of $24,000 to the Monastery to assist with the settle­ ment of Kampucheans. Now, in recognition of the far greater;   number of refugees coming into the Monastery's care during this 

 financial year than was originally expected, and the comprehensive  range of welfare services which the MRP offers to its residents, I am pleased to grant the additional aid." :

 Mr Macphee noted that community response to a joint public appeal  for funds for the Indo-China Refugee Association (ICRA) and .  ‘   the MRP had not been as great as hoped for ^ He asked that the 

 public give as generously as they could, maintaining the '  â 

 distinguished record which the South Australian community has  I  achieved in refugee settlement.  .

 .  Mr Macphee pointed out that South Australians were still- the '  . greatest supporters of the Community Refugee Settlement Scheme . .   (CRSS) - of which the Monastery project is a part.

 "Overall, South Australia has taken in over 1,000 refugees through  the CRSS since the Scheme began in late 1979, out of a national  total of approximately 4,500", ,he said. ,  '  .  ,
