 Abstract: The September 11th and October 12th terrorist attacks and their aftermath 

 have  focussed  Australia’s  attention  on  the  shift  from  a  Christian  to  a  paradoxically  

 multifaith  and  secular  Australia,  and  on  the  diasporic  links  between  organizations’  

 source countries and on Australian ethnic and religious leaders. They are now under 

 greater  scrutiny  and  accountability.  In  outlining  Australia’s  current  predicament,  

 Professor  Cahill  will  take  a  global  perspective  and  draw  on  current  Australian  

 research  to  suggest  a  way  forward  by  addressing  key  issues  and  inoculating  our  

 society against ethnic and religious extremism. Faith traditions with their focus on the 

 ultimate  and  the  absolute  as  well  as  the  local  and  the  universal  have  been  key  

 elements in the formation of Australia’s pluralist and multicultural society. With their 

 localised  presence,  their  community  ethic  and  their  universalist  outlook,  most  

 religious  groups  have  made  positive  contributions  to  the  construction  of  a  

 multicultural society. On the other side of the coin, religion has sometimes acted as an 

 oppressive or divisive force such as in the suppression of Aboriginal spirituality, the 

 tensions  between  Catholicism  and  Protestantism  that  was  a  feature  of  Australian  

 society until the 1960s and the tensions between certain immigrant communities as a 

 direct consequence of hostilities in their home countries. In more recent times, some 

 ethnoreligious groups could have been more proactive and assertive in assisting their 

 communities to address specific issues such as the AIDS threat, sexual corruption and 

 the gambling epidemic. However, religion at its best remains an asset and a resource, 

 but this can only be achieved through a repositioning of the link between religion and 

 civil society.

 Introduction 

 

 After September 11th  .2001, never again can we, as citizens of the world, look at skyscrapers in quite 

 the  same  way;  they  are  now  symbols  of  the  risk  and  unpredictability  of  the  future;  the  events  of  

 September  11th.  were  symptomatic  and  brought  to  the  public  surface  long-term trends.  After  October  

 12th., we Australians can no longer wander about our tourist resorts in thongs and shorts with quite the 

 same relaxed, carefree Aussie spirit. Our multicultural innocence was lost at Kuta Beach on the island 

 paradise  of  Bali  when  so  many  Australians  lost  their  lives.  It  was  a  Hindu  island  paradise  carefully  

 chosen by the extremist Islamic terrorists to show their white-hot hatred not just for Hindus persecuting 

 their  co-religionists  in  India  but  more  specifically  against  the  West,  particularly  Americans  and  

 including  Australians.  Speaking  through  the  Al-Jazeera  TV  network,  Osama  bin  Laden,  the  

 international  warlord  and  now  hero  to  the  downtrodden  Muslim  masses  across  the  world,  approved,  

 citing  six  countries,  including  Australia,  to  be  wary:  “Australia  was  warned  about  its  participation  in  

 Afghanistan and its ignoble contribution to the separation of East Timor. It ignored this warning until it 

 was awakened by the echoes of explosions in Bali. As you assassinate, so will you be assassinated; and 

 as you bomb, so will you be bombed”.  

 

 Ten days after the terrorist attacks, 10,000 people of all faith communities and people of goodwill came 

 together at Melbourne Park for a multi-faith gathering. Seven faith communities drew on their spiritual 

 heritages to reflect on the events of September 11th. 2001. 

 

 â¢ the Buddhist community, to the deep-throated gong of a bell sounding the passing of life, asked us 

 to close our eyes and become bodies of light, praying for this disaster not to worsen and for us to 

 be  enlightened  that  the  enemy  and  those  who  harm  us  can  be  our  best  teachers  and  that  we  

 consider the Karmic causes and origins of the hatred that drove the terrorists 

 

 â¢ to  the  sound  of  the  ram’s  horn,  the  oldest  known  musical  instrument,  in  the  year  5762  of  its  

 calendar, the Jewish community asked us to reflect on the Talmudic saying, “Those who share in 

 the grief of the community will share in its redemption” to which they invited us to respond with 

 “Amen” 

 

 â¢ the Hindus focussed on the aphorism that ‘experience is not what happens to you; it is what you do 

 with what happens to you’, lighting the candle of love for peace and prosperity for the world and 

 for the departed souls, and praying “may there be peace in the heavenly regions” in line with the 

 great Hindu principle of ahimsa, non injury, that “it is the principle of the pure of heart never to 

 injure  others,  even  when  they  themselves  have  been  fatefully  injured”  and  with  Gandhi’s  advice  

 that “an eye for an eye, and soon everyone will be blind”. 

 

 â¢ the  Sikhs  were  consumed  by  the  horror  of  it  all,  and  in  our  despair  they  cried  out,  “O  God,  the  

 world is going up in flames; save it; by whatever means, deliver it. O God, who can save it?” 

 

 4  CAHILL, Des  

 

 â¢ the  Muslim  imam,  focussing  on  “the  convulsion  of  the  days”,  in  sending  their  community’s  

 condolences  to  the  people  of  the  USA,  prayed  for  peace  and  harmony  in  the  whole  world  and  

 reminded us, “O all mankind, fear your Lord”. 

 

 â¢ the  Bahais  prayed,  “O  my  God,  O  my  God,  unite  the  hearts  of  thy  servants;  help  them  to  serve  

 thee; leave them not to themselves”, enjoining us that “the thought of hatred must be destroyed by 

 the more powerful thought of love” 

 

 â¢ and  lastly,  the  Christian  singer  sang  of  “beautiful  brokenness’,  the  beautiful  brokenness  of  the  

 cross followed by the resurrectional transformation, and the reader recited the Beatitudes, “Blessed 

 are  they  who  mourn;  they  shall  be  comforted;  blessed  are  the  merciful;  they  shall  have  mercy  

 shown them”, imploring through the voice of the carpenter, “we want justice, not vengeance”. 

 

 Ironically and  sadly,  a year later certain faith leaders in Melbourne refused  to  have  a similar service, 

 and it was held in St. Paul’s Anglican Cathedral. Here, in Australia, religious tolerance and acceptance 

 have  been  hallmarks  of  our  multicultural  society  but,  in  rapidly  changing  circumstances,  we  need  to  

 have  co-operative  and  imaginative  leadership  of  our  ethnic  and  religious  communities  as  Australia  

 moves from being a Christian to a multi-faith society. Imagination is at the core of globalization, and 

 we must have the imagination and courage to implement new solutions as new issues are addressed. 

 

 The  terrorist  attacks  brought  home  to  us,  firstly,  that  the  post-Cold  War  world  has  changed  and  the  

 nature of the low-tech, high impact audacity highlights the central themes of the current world crisis; 

 secondly,  that  the  global  societies  squandered  the  opportunities  of  the  1990s  to  create  a  new  world  

 order and that S11 gives another, perhaps final, opportunity to create civilizational dialogue and a more 

 appropriate  form  of  global  governance  though  subsequent  events  of  the  aftermath  do  not  give  

 optimism; and lastly, that religion, whether transcendent religion or perverted religion, is at the centre 

 of world stage. It is very apparent, certainly for the several decades ahead, that religion and faith are 

 not  going  to  drift  away into  a  privatised  world  as  many atheists  and  agnostics  had  predicted.  In  fact,  

 one  of  the  major  features  of  twentieth  century  history  was  the  enduring  stability  of  religion  and  its  

 institutions - 86 per cent of the world’s population belong to a religious faith (2 billion are Christian, 

 1.2 are Muslim and .8 billion are Hindu) and in Australia, the comparable figure is about 75 per cent.   

 

 

 THE GLOBAL CONTEXT 

 

 The recent Pew Global Attitudes Project (Pew Research Center 2002) in a survey of 44 countries late in 

 2002,  not  including  Australia,  measured  the  importance  of  religion  in  people’s  lives.  In  Africa,  no  

 fewer  that  eight-in-ten  in  any  country  saw  religion  as  very  important  personally.  Majorities  in  every  

 Latin American country also subscribe to the same view with the exception of Argentina (only 39%). 

 

 5  CAHILL, Des  

 In Muslim countries such as Indonesia, Pakistan, Mali and Senegal, more than nine-in-ten also consider 

 religion  as  very  important  in  their  lives  though  less  so  in  Turkey  (65%)  and  particularly  Uzbekistan  

 (35%). In Europe, religion is not considered very important with the lowest scores of 11 per cent in the 

 Czech Republic and France. In the United Kingdom, 39 per cent considered religion as very important, 

 just behind the European leaders (Poland 39% and the Ukraine 35%). Religion is very important in all 

 Asian countries surveyed (Indonesia 95%, India 92%, the Philippines 88% and Bangladesh 88%) with 

 the exception of Korea (25%), Viet Nam (24%) and Japan (12%). Thus, secularism is present in all the 

 wealthy countries with one very major exception - the United States of America where 59 per cent of 

 the population consider that religion is very important in their lives. 

 

 We  live  in  a  world  where  it  is  less  possible  to  speak  of  “Christendom”  or  “the  Islamic  world”  as  

 religious  diasporas  continue  to  be  extended  across  the  world.  In  this  generation  since  World  War  II,  

 Christianity has moved in its population base from the countries of the rich North to  the countries of 

 the  poor  South,  and  this  trend  will  never  be  reversed.  The  next  Pope  will  more  likely  come  from  a  

 country in the South, the two most favoured candidates at the moment being a Nigerian cardinal and a 

 cardinal  from  Tegucigalpa  in  Honduras.  In  London,  each  Sunday,  the  majority  of  church-goers  are  

 black.  Both  Islam  and  Hinduism  perceive  in  Europe  a  great  spiritual  vacuum  which  they  have  long-term designs to fill. Religion could well be replacing ideology in a world without boundaries as more 

 people  in  a  less  predictable  world  seek  stability  in  faith  in  God  or  the  Great  Beyond  and  citizens  in  

 functioning democracies such as India and Turkey place their future in faith-based political parties. The 

 success  of  Christian  pentecostalism  and  evangelical  groups  has  been  due  to  the  negative  effects  of  

 globalization  -  the  response  of  many  believers  to  economic  globalization  has  been  to  rely  on  their  

 religious  faith  to  reinforce  a  defensive,  “circle-the-wagons”  mentality,  increasing  their  fear  of  those  

 perceived to be ‘other’. (Bartchy 2002) 

 

 The  future  is  not  one  of  increasing  secularism,  and  there  will  be  increasing  competition  and  conflict  

 between  the  major  religions  (Bartchy  2002).  Religious  extremism  may  align  itself  with  a  highly  

 politicized,  perverted  faith  that  is  prepared  to  go  beyond  the  previous  parameters  of  violence  -  the  

 antidote is not more secularism of the 1960s and 1970s type against which the extremists are usually 

 reacting   but  rather  a  strengthening  of  religious  moderation.  Throughout  these  events,  and  so  many  

 other  recent  ones  too  numerous  to  list,  have  reverberated  the  threads  of  diversity  and  religion  in  a  

 globalizing world.  While some  may dismiss it as globaloney,  globalization,  or  preferably global-local 

 interconnectedness,  with  its  compression  of  time  and  space  and  its  intensification  of  the  world’s  

 interdependency  built  on  the  revolutions  in  transportation  and  the  information  technologies  and  the  

 political  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union,  is  an  unstoppable  juggernaut.  The  tragedy  in  the  USA  

 encapsulates  the  central  themes  of  globalization,  not  just  of  economic  globalization  which  the  global  

 intelligentsia  and  opinion-makers  focus  upon,  but  also  of  social  and  cultural  globalization  in  which  

 religion, language and ethnicity are intertwined with economic, political and media processes.  

 

 

 6  CAHILL, Des  

 I  want  to  reflect,  in  the  light  of  September  11th.,   on  the  formation  of  multi-faith  societies  across  the  

 world, and the interconnection with certain key features of globalization. As we work our way through 

 this present world crisis, I would like to suggest that governance bodies, whether at the local, national 

 or  international  levels,  need  to  renegotiate  their  relationships  with  faith  communities,  and  that  faith  

 communities  need  to  renegotiate  their  relationships  with  each  other  in  the  light  of  their  profoundest  

 spiritualities.  This  global-local  faiths  agenda  will  require  leadership  and  investment  on  all  sides  

 together with the capacity to imagine a new future. Imagination is at the core of globalization.  

 

 Firstly,  I  want  to  briefly  focus  on  the  six  main  features  of  globalization  and  their  interaction  with  

 religiosity  and  religious  organizations,  and  ultimately  the  spiritualities  that  underpin  the  great  global  

 and local religious traditions. 

 

 

 The Triumph of Global Capitalism 

 

 â¢ with the fall of the communist states and their command economies, global financial capitalism, if 

 not crass commercialism, has triumphed. It talks up the notions of free and open trade, convertible 

 currencies  and  shares  as  the  engine  of  growth  on  behalf  of  the  world’s  leading  countries  who  

 corrupt the world’s agricultural systems and allow the free flows of money, technology and media 

 images but not of people; it talks down the losers, the basketcase countries, mostly in Africa, and 

 their monstrous debt burdens increasing the cleavage between rich and poor; but it is a capitalism 

 built  always  on  shifting  sands  as  the  markets  react  to  world  events.  Capitalism  has  been  

 accompanied,  from  the  1950s,  by  secularization,  modernity  and  now  post-modernity.  Yet  across  

 the  world,  according  to  Haynes  (1998),  there  have  been  a  range  of  religious  responses  such  as  

 resistance  both  to  the  disestablishment  of  state  religion  and  to  the  differentiation  of  the  religious  

 and  the  secular  as  seen  in  the  rise  of  the  fundamentalist  or  revivalist  groups;  such  as  the  

 mobilizations and counter-mobilizations against other religions and secular movements or parties; 

 such  as  religious  groups’  mobilization  in  defence  of  the  rule  of  law  and  of  social,  political  and  

 religious  rights.  The  anti-religious  ideologies  of  Nazism and  Communism have  been  thrown  into  

 the  dustbin  of  history.  As  historians  reflect  upon  the  twentieth  century,  according  to  the  Oxford  

 historian, Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, author of a major study of the history of the second Christian 

 millennium, they will be impressed by the enduring stability of religion and its institutions. All the 

 predictions  by  such  varied  individuals  as  Nietzsche,  H.G.  Wells,  Lenin,  Bertrand  Russell  and  

 Arthur C. Clarke that religion would die have proved wrong. Religion is now very much at centre 

 stage. 

 

 The Rise of the Global City 

 

 â¢ The  rise  of  the  global  city  is  a  second  important  feature  of  globalization  because  the  global  city  

 plugs  the  nation  into  the  world’s  networks.  And  diversity  takes  place  mainly  in  the  city.  Secular  

 

 7  CAHILL, Des  

 global cities such as New York and Singapore with their skyscrapers thrusting to the skies, nodes 

 of the global network, sucking up the resources of their rural hinterlands, triggering the politics of 

 resentment and grievance and exploiting the rural and migrant workers who flock to the city - this 

 further exacerbates the rift between the professional global and  national elites together with their 

 techno-cadres  and  the  disenfranchised,  the  lowly  skilled  and  the  job  insecure.  While  religions  

 always hanker for the solitude  of the fields and  the forest, essentially, while they may weep  over 

 the city, they are engaged in and with the cities with their beauty and their filth, their grandeur and 

 their  corruption,  their  boredom  and  their  creativity,  the  place  for  the  rich  and  the  homeless,  the  

 artistic and the bored. And it is in the cities that we are seeing the rise of new religions with more 

 religious  diversification  and  where  inter-faith  encounters  are  taking  place  all  the  time  -  in  the  

 neighbourhoods  and  the  schools,  the  factories  and  the  shops.  Counterbalancing  the  rich  global  

 cities  are  the  distraught,  impoverished  cities  of  the  world,  cesspools  of  poverty,  disease  and  

 corruption. And standing between them as a sign and symbol of peace between the religions is the 

 City of Jerusalem, the City of Peace, the city sacred to the Three Peoples of the Book, and there 

 cannot be peace in the Middle East unless there is agreement over Jerusalem. 

 

 The Formation of Global Ethnic and Religious Diasporas 

 

 â¢ A  third  feature  is  people  on  the  move.  Central  to  globalization  has  been  the  creation  of  

 multilayered  movements  of  people  such  as  the  movements  of  global  professionals  working  for  

 international  organizations,  national  governments,  global  social  movements  and  transnational  

 corporations; universities are moving their students world-wide  as part of the internationalization 

 of their curricula; then there are the international contract workers, landfarers and seafarers, led by 

 the  Filipinos;  older  tourists  and  their  backpacker  children,  conference  attendees  and  religious  

 pilgrims  to  places  such  as  Mecca  and  Rome  paying  homage  at  their  sacred  sites.  As  economic  

 expectations  rise,  there  are  the  permanent  migrants  together  with  border-hoppers,  and  as  inter-ethnic  conflicts  rise,  growing  numbers  of  asylum  claimants  and  refugees,  victims  of  ethnic  

 cleansing and growing numbers of illegals looking for a better future they see each night on their 

 television screens; in the future, there will be environmental refugees as sea levels rise and small 

 island nations endure their version of the Great Flood. Also to be noted is the rise of international 

 marriages,  a  very  accurate  barometer  of  inter-ethnic  and  inter-religious  relations.  Fortunately  or  

 unfortunately,  love  takes  little  notice  of  border  sentry-posts,  and  the  old  Chinese  saying  that  “a  

 chicken  does  not  marry  a  duck”  is  increasingly  irrelevant  -  yet  religious  and  ethnic  community  

 leaders  have  varied  enormously  in  their  reaction  to  outright  condemnation  and  ostracization  to  

 quiet antipathy to genuine ambivalence or to perhaps a resigned acceptance of the inevitable. This 

 reconfiguration of national and religious profiles implies that religious pluralism cannot be wished 

 away nor can the intermingling of cultures and religions be synthesized into a syncretist amalgam 

 in some form of global culture and global religion. Also as a consequence, diasporas to a greater or 

 lesser extent create a transnational ethnic economy and a transnational public sphere which carries 

 on their debates overtly or covertly in discourse perhaps little known to their host countries and to 

 

 8  CAHILL, Des  

 McWorld - the ICT revolution means they can more easily be networked across time and space; if 

 these diasporas provide cities with multicultural colour and cuisine, they also can provide cover for 

 religious encapsulation and, unfortunately, for international criminals and terrorists. 

 

 The Linguistic and Communication Landscape and Political Power 

 

 â¢ Associated with diasporas is a fourth feature: the emergence of a complex multilayered linguistic 

 pasticchio dominated by several variants of global English dominant as the international means of 

 communication  but  layered  underneath  are  other  world  languages  such  as  Arabic,  Mandarin  and  

 Spanish,  other  local  forms of English such as  Singlish,  Manglish and  Taglish,  national  languages 

 such as Swedish and Korean together with regional, tribal and indigenous languages. For a while it 

 was  thought  that  the  internet  would  be  dominated  by English  -  several  years  ago,  80  per  cent  of  

 internet exchanges were in English, whereas by 2000 it had dropped to 45 per cent with Chinese, 

 Hindi and Spanish the big movers. Within two years in 2003, the figure is estimated to be 29 per 

 cent  (Global  Reach  2001).  Despite  the  delusions  of  the  Americanists,  cultural  homogenization  is  

 not the global future. This is not to say that burgers and PCs will not be available across the world. 

 The global future will be multilayered with, as one top layer, a common but differentiated global 

 culture  but  there  will  be  other  layers  that  will  reflect  the  values  and  practices  of  particular  

 religions,  languages,  cultures  and  regions.  Global  society,  as  the  power  of  the  United  States  

 recedes, will be criss-crossed by a multi-polar or multi-nodal world as countries such as Russia and 

 China  and  political  groupings  such  as  the  European  Union,  the  Ibero-American  Summit,  the  

 Portuguese  grouping and  the  Organization of Islamic  Council  gain cohesion and  strength.  China,  

 India and Russia have begun a high level dialogue to create a ‘strategic triangle’ and ‘a multi-polar 

 world’ which is a euphemism to counter the USA’s global dominance. Other challenges will come 

 from the Arab and non-Arab Islamic world and from the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking worlds 

 of Europe and Latin America now that Spain is gaining in confidence after the dark years of the 

 Francoist regime. For global faith communities, the implication is the maintenance of the balance 

 between  a  universalism  that  seeks  unity  and  uniformity  across  the  world  and  a  network  of  

 particularisms where faith communities are too  aligned  to  cultures and  ethnicities that degenerate 

 into destructive ethnonationalisms. 

 

 Localized wars and the politics of identity 

 

 â¢ Partly as a consequence of the end of the Cold War, a fifth and dangerous aspect, highlighted by 

 the USA tragedy, is the rise of the so-called politics of identity, the politics of memory, the politics 

 of  retribution.  At  the  last  Assembly  of  the  World  Conference  on  Religion  and  Peace  held  in  

 Amman in November 1999, its Secretary-General, Dr. William Vendley, stated the new post Cold 

 War context: “The end of the ideologically based proxy wars in the East-West competition of the 

 Cold War has given way to the rapid proliferation of smaller scale, more localised armed conflicts. 

 Increasingly  people  have  sought  security  through  identification  with  a  group  closer  to  their  own  

 

 9  CAHILL, Des  

 experience  and  over  which  they  have  some  control.  Most  violent  conflicts  today  occur  between  

 identity  groups  within  national  boundaries,  making  them  inter-group  in  character  and  internal  or  

 intra-national  in  scope.  Group  identity  may  be  based  on  some  mix  of  ethnicity,  clan,  race  or  

 geographical  affiliation,  but  it  also  typically  involves  religious  factors.  Recent  examples  

 complement more ancient ones in illustrating that religion, insofar as it is related to how a people 

 or  culture  define  themselves,  can  be  manipulated  to  become  a  factor  in  this  type  of  conflict”  

 (Vendley 1999: 1). Since 1989, there have been approximately 110 armed conflicts, seven between 

 States while the rest are intra-State in nature. Part of this scenario is the emergence of non-State 

 actors such as local and international warlords, ethnically or religiously motivated terrorist groups 

 and money oriented criminal groups involved in the illegal drug or diamond trade and laundering 

 money through safe havens. The future, if historical reflection is to be our guide, is for more, not 

 less, refugees. 

 

 Risk and Global Governance 

 

 â¢ The  sixth  and  connected  feature  concerns  risk  and  global  governance.  As  we  have  already  said,  

 never again can we look at skyscrapers in the same way. These steel and concrete cathedrals, those 

 tall  minarets  reaching  to  the  sky,  are  now symbols  of  the  risk  and  unpredictability  of  the  future.  

 For  more  than  a  decade,  theorists  like  Ulrich  Beck  have  been  writing  about  the  “world  risk  

 society”, about the risk of a backlash against the West; they have spoken about the link between 

 risk, responsibility and trust, and of “organized irresponsibility” and the “limited controllability” of 

 the  dangers  we  face,  the  dangers  from  the  disorganized  capitalist  market,  of  the  polluted  

 environment,  of  the  fanatical  terrorist  group,  of  the  destruction  of  tradition  and  wisdom  and  

 scholarship. 

 

 

 The Contemporary Currency of Religion 

 

 In response to the challenges of globalizing forces, some world leaders have seen the major religions as 

 part  of  the  solution  because  of  their  fundamentally  altruistic  orientation  and  because  of  both  their  

 unrivalled access to grassroots communities and their world-wide networks.  

 

 But religion and spirituality did not die except perhaps in the West with its fear of death and its fetish 

 with  “fun”.  Some  sociologists  came  to  the  conclusion  that  faith  builds  community,  and  the  

 psychologists and psychiatrists, over-aware of the destructive nature of religious phobias and scruples, 

 realised that, other things being equal, faith is more related to emotional stability than to instability. In 

 China  after  50  years  of  official  atheism,  there  is  a  profound  spiritual  thirst.  In  the  West,  the  youth  

 suicide  and  youth  drug  addiction  studies  suggest  that  young  people  need  not  just  a  stable  family  life  

 unmessed  by  divorce  and  separation  but  a  belief  in  something  beyond  themselves  instead  of  the  

 gnawing, superficial nihilism of pop culture with its fattening fast food, decibel music, and drugged-up 

 

 10  CAHILL, Des  

 pop  stars.  Religion  can  remind  us  that  sitting  in  front  of  a  computer  screen,  like  sitting  in  front  of  a  

 poker  machine  or  hushly around  a  black-jack  table,  are  activities  not  fully human.  As  our  computers  

 become  more  and  more  clogged  up  with  emails,  religion  reminds  us  that  print  is  not  necessarily  

 communication, information is not necessarily wisdom, and lack of noise is not necessarily silence.   

 

 If it is to  survive and  develop  over the long term, a cultural system needs to  have  a spiritual base. It 

 might  well  be  a  civic  rather  than  a  spiritual  faith  though  the  foundations  of  civic  religion  are  weak.  

 Religion also offers an antidote to cultural homogenization; it can build a sense of belonging and help 

 in constructing a multifaceted identity in a global world where the sense of ”home” has become more 

 problematic.  It  provides  an  additional  binding  element  to  the  links  that  bond  together  diasporic  or  

 transnational  communities.  Religion  has  become  more  public,  except  in  the  Western  developed  

 countries  where,  with  clericalism  in  its  death  throes,  it  decays  behind  closed  doors  in  the  main,  

 privatised  and  relativised,  except  for  occasions  of  tragedy such  as  the  death  of  Princess  Diana  where  

 civic religion comes to the fore. Religion still retains its potency as seen in the rise of the BJP in India, 

 in  the  emergence  of  charismatic  and  evangelical  movements  in  European-heritage  countries  and  the  

 rise of the Falun Gong in contemporary China. If religion has retained its potency, it has also retained 

 its  capacity  to  be  manipulated.  Ex-communist  Russian  leaders  have  rushed  to  be  photographed  

 smilingly  alongside  Orthodox  leaders;  religious  factors  have  been  one  factor  in  almost  all  local  

 conflicts in Africa as well as being a positive factor in reconciliation in Sierra Leone in 1999 and 2000; 

 religiosity  has  never  not  been  a  factor  in  the  various  stages  of  the  recent  Balkans  saga  and  religion  

 remains an underlying factor in the major hotspots such as Afghanistan, Israel and Palestine, Sri Lanka, 

 Northern Ireland and Chechnya. 

 

 

 Religion and global-local social capital 

 

 What are the implications of this changing, diverse, disjunctional, multi-faith landscape? What can be 

 done  to  foster  and  guarantee  ethnic  and  religious  cohesion  in  the  global-local  neighbourhood?  In  a  

 multi-faith world, what can we, as a group of people holding common wealth and social capital, do to 

 move beyond the WTC calamity with the acrid smoke and soot now dissipating from the nostrils of the 

 world, after the removal of the anti-Islamic Taliban and now on the eve of the Iraq War?  

 

 

 THE GLOBAL-LOCAL FAITHS AGENDA 

 

 In endeavouring to provide the contours of a response and the formulation of a hyphenated global-local 

 faiths  agenda,  we  need  to  take  a  reality  check  and  acknowledge,  firstly,  that  faith  communities,  

 especially the  missionizing  ones,  are  in  competition  with  each  other  in  marketing  their  faith  products  

 and keeping their market share as much as they are in conflict or in co-operation with each other. Co-operation is not easily achieved  even when there is no  historical baggage  of hostility and  war. While 

 

 11  CAHILL, Des  

 belief  is  much  more  than  a  commercial  product,  the  religious  message  still  has  to  be  marketed  and  

 packaged  because  each  thinks  that  their  product  is  the  best,  especially  if  they  are  insistent  on  

 themselves as repositories of ultimate truth. There is the movement towards unity and co-operation as 

 seen  in  the  ecumenical  movement  within  Christianity,  the  interfaith  dialogues  at  national  and  

 international  levels  and  the  growth  of  organizations  such  as  the  World  Conference  of  Religion  for  

 Peace  and  the  World’s  Parliament  of  Religions.  But  this  is  countermanded  by  the  fact  that  faith  

 communities  are  at  one  level  players  in  the  global  marketing  game  as  seen  in  the  global  pastorate  of  

 Papa Wojtyla and the spiritual interventions of the Dalai Lama.  

 

 Secondly, religious faith is a solid, robust entity, not easily moved nor opened to global horizons. There 

 are  the  religious  captive  identities,  held  within  their  own  subcultural  and  religious  enclosure,  which  

 avoid  or  are  afraid  of  contact  with  religiously  different  groups  whom  they  may  demonise,  which  are  

 aggressively  bigoted  in  arguing  for  the  superiority  of  their  own  religious  faith,  and  are  strenuously  

 opposed to contacts with other faiths and to entering into any kind of dialogue. Then there is the more 

 comfortable  religiously  encapsulated  identities  which  participate  primarily  within  their  own  religious  

 group with some but little outside contact, have internalized the superiority of their faith commitment 

 but not aggressively so, aware of the existence of other faiths but apathetic towards them and ignorant 

 of them.  

 

 What we need are reflective inter-religious identities with a global view like cosmonauts who are fully 

 committed to their faith tradition, able to clarify and defend its values and attitudes but able to reflect 

 on  the  essential  nature  of  religious  activity  and  expression  and  wish  to  dialogue  with  and  participate  

 with members of other faith groups and  their religious rituals; in that commitment to  their own faith, 

 they have moved beyond it in seeing all religious faiths in mystical and cosmic terms as expressions of 

 God  or  the  Absolute  or  the  Numinous  and  have  a  multi-faith  competency  in  terms  of  attitudes,  

 knowledge and skills. 

 

 Thirdly, as has been already suggested, the varying kinds of interrelationships between religion, culture 

 and  nationalism  imply  that  the  emerging  new  order  will  see  greater  levels  of  ethnic  and  religious  

 conflict.  Whilst  for  all  of  us  the  experience  of  inter-faith  contact  generates  warm,  fuzzy,  altruistic  

 feelings, we need to warn against the naivetÃ© that is often found in the inter-ethnic and inter-faith area 

 which is full of hidden complexities, subtleties and  vexed  historical legacies. The aftermath events of 

 the  USA  tragedy  have  highlighted  this  point.  Religious  fundamentalism  is  increasingly  seen  in  the  

 major  religious  groupings  where  the  religious  framework  is  aligned  with  a  Biblical  or  Qu’ranic  

 fundamentalism or with an introverted nationalism which does not accept the universalism that is at the 

 authentic core of all major world religions. 

 

 Again, what can be done? In thinking both globally and locally, there are five steps that I would like to 

 place on the religion and diversity agenda in the global ecumene: 

 

 

 12  CAHILL, Des  

 1.  International Governance Organizations and the Global Faiths Agenda   

 The construction of a realistic global governance agenda beyond  what we presently have has become 

 critical. The Manhattan message is that the world is in trouble, and that disorder in the world cannot be 

 fenced  off.  At  the  emergency  session  of  the  World  Conference  on  Religion  and  Peace  held  in  New  

 York  40  days  after  September  11th,  the  Islamic  representatives  complained  that  while  they  represent,  

 with  over  one  billion  people,  one  sixth  of  humanity,  they  are  not  permanently  represented  on  the  

 Security Council. As part of this broader agenda, we  need  to  construct and  negotiate a global human 

 coalition built partly around  the major faith communities and  their leaders. Of course, there has been 

 some  dialogue  with many initiatives and  the formation of organizations such as the Parliament of the 

 World’s Religions, the Three Faiths Forum and the World Conference of Religion and Peace. It seems 

 to  me  that  we  need  to  engage  religious  community  leadership  not  just  with  the  fact  that  this  is  a  

 multicultural and multifaith world, but, more importantly, that it is an inter-cultural and inter-religious 

 world.  

 

 The  international  community  has  a  vested  interest  in  encouraging  the  transnational  linking  of  the  

 national  and  local  nodes  of  global  faith  communities  to  hear  the  voices  and  narratives  of  their  own  

 particular diasporas and of other faiths and spiritualities, the voices of the many traditions, the pastoral 

 and the mystical, at the core and at the periphery,  the voices of moderation challenging the voices of 

 extremism,  highlighting  and  celebrating  their  internal  unity and  diversity and  learning  to  engage  with  

 other  religious  traditions.  The  international  community  has  a  vested  interest  in  encouraging,  also  at  

 global  and  regional  levels,  strategic  inter-faith  contact  not  so  much  to  understand  and  debate  their  

 religious similarities and differences, but to develop their own global theologies for a multi-faith world 

 and  to  negotiate  and  address  social  and  cultural  issues,  to  address  core  issues  such  as  poverty  and  

 human  rights  and  to  plan  for  the  construction  of  global-local  social  and  spiritual  capital.  The  current  

 structures  and  mechanisms  need  capacity-building  in  constructing  a  global  architecture  for  religious  

 tolerance, if not harmony.  

 

 But another change has taken place in managing diversity. Whereas public institutions at national and 

 global levels downgraded or even ignored the role of religion during the Cold War except when it was 

 convenient to  co-opt religion in the ideological battle between Moscow and  Washington, religion has 

 been returning to centre stage as we have previously suggested. “Across the world, there is a dawning 

 recognition  that  religions  have  both  moral  and  institutional  assets  that,  if  mobilized  and  equipped,  

 could provide uniquely important contributions to solving conflicts” (Vendley 1999: 1). In other words, 

 religion is seen more as part of the solution than part of the problem. The World Bank is funding the 

 World Faiths Development Dialogue with its centre in Oxford. World religious leaders were invited to 

 participate in Davos 2003. 

 

 

 13  CAHILL, Des  

 2.  The Articulation of an International Covenant on Individual and Collective Religious Rights 

 and Responsibilities 

 

 With  the  increasing  formation  of  multi-faith  societies,  it  has  now  become  urgent  to  articulate  more  

 precisely  the  nature  of  religious  rights  for  individuals  and  their  faith  communities  and  their  mutual  

 responsibilities to work for inter-religious harmony and global cohesion. It needs to be a document that 

 addresses the contexts of diasporic communities and inter-faith contexts, and it seems appropriate that 

 the articulation process should be fostered and choreographed by the United Nations but built upon a 

 grass-roots  educative  and  consultative  process  that  involves  faith  communities  across  the  world.  My  

 dream is that it be affirmed across the world by every religious community, modem and modemless.  

 

 Related to this is the notion of a global-local ethic. The contours of a global ethic are only emerging, 

 and the trigger was the UN Declaration on Human Rights together with other international conventions 

 such  as  the  International  Covenant  on  Civil  and  Political  Rights.  But  there  are  difficulties  in  the  

 construction  of  a  global  ethic.  In  1993,  after  a  preparatory  period,  the  Parliament  of  the  World’s  

 Religions met in Chicago and approved the Declaration toward a Global Ethic, built around the axiom, 

 there can be no peace among the nations without peace among the religions. The Declaration was built 

 around  the  basic  principle,  ‘every  human  being  must  be  treated  humanely’  found  in  every  great  

 religious or ethical tradition and also the so-called Golden Rule, “Do not do to another what you would 

 not  want  to  be  done  to  you’,  and  around  the  four  fundamental  ethical  demands found  in all  the  great  

 religions, ‘Do not kill, do not steal, do not lie, do not commit sexual immorality’. 

 

 3.  The Repositioning of the Faith-State Relationship   

 In  a  global  world  characterised  by  ideoscapes,  financescapes,  mediascapes,  ethnoscapes  and  

 technoscapes,  the  role  of  the  nation  state  has  changed  because  it  is  inescapably  vulnerable  to  global  

 processes.  Despite  Kenichi  Omae’s  claim  that  the  nation  state  is  increasingly  “a  nostalgic  fiction”,  it  

 will  survive,  as  the  popular  song  says,  though  some  will  divide  and  break  up,  and  borders  generally  

 will  become  more  porous.  Each  nation  state  has  had  to  reposition  itself  in  the  fractal  global  

 neighbourhood.  This  raises  the  faith-state  relationship  which  till  now  has  expressed  itself  in  the  

 separation  of  religion  and  state  on  the  one  hand  or  in  the  close  configuration  between  religion  and  

 government  in  theocratic  states  on  the  other.  Neither  extreme  is  helpful.  Defining  the  social  and  

 political  space  for  faith  communities  is  a  delicate  art  -  it  requires  communities  to  practise  their  faith  

 with due regard to their multi-faith contexts but also  to accomplish their task of building up  cultural, 

 social and spiritual capital that contributes to the broader nation-building and world citizenship agenda. 

 But it has to allow religion to be counter-cultural in critiquing society for its social and spiritual ills.   

 

 It  seems  to  me  that  every  society  has  to  construct  a  multicultural  or  inter-faith  agenda  or  charter  or  

 some  such  document  that  is  built  around  generally  accepted  values  and  provides  both  structures  and  

 funds to be invested for the future well-being of nation states. In this process of repositioning, it seems 

 

 14  CAHILL, Des  

 to  me  that  the  notion  of  ‘secular’  is  not  helpful  because  it  is  overburdened  with  too  much  historical  

 baggage and needs to be replaced with the notion of ‘a civil society’. 

 

 4.  The  Harnessing  of  International  Business  in  the  Creation  of  Global  and  National  Social   Capital 

 

 We are in a new situation as money, commodities and people chase each other around the world with 

 the  frenetic  expansion  of  transnational  corporate  activity  and  the  growing  authority  of  financial  

 institutions  above  the  nation  state.  The  anti-globalists  see  current  global  processes  as  essentially  a  

 continuation of the exploitative past. James Petras (1998) who dismisses the claims of globalists who 

 suggest  that  their  theories  are  “the  filet  mignon  of  social  theory’  suggests  that  the  emerging  social  

 context  -  with  the  USA  as  the  advance  model  of  the  future  -  is  ‘a  nineteenth  century  lookalike’  of  

 Dickensian  proportions  with  health  care  more  dependent  on  income  level,  impoverished  families  

 sometimes  neatly  hiding  their  desperation,  increased  numbers  of  abandoned  and  exploited  children,  

 greater  use  of  prison  labour,  downward  mobility  of  the  younger  generations,  longer  work  hours  for  

 salaried staff,  increased job insecurity and regressive taxation coming increasingly from wage earners 

 and from gambling with the transnational corporations  becoming the artful dodgers of taxation. 

 

 The darker side thus has been that multinational corporations are able to play governments off against 

 each other, resulting in a seeming need for the international co-ordination of corporate tax policies so 

 as  national  tax  bases  are  not  eroded.  Another  negative  is  that  some  countries  either  because  of  such  

 factors  as  national  resource  deficiency,  lack  of  an  educated  workforce,  dangerous  agricultural  and  

 industrial  practices  or  political  or  economic  mismanagement  have  become  or  may  become  

 ‘international basketcases’. 

 

 International and local business after the collapse of the World Trade Centre now have a vested interest 

 in  furthering  the  interrelationship  between  humans  right  observance,  the  democratization  of  nations   

 and  the  social  responsibility  of  business  to  build  up  social  and  spiritual  capital.  Globally  engaged  

 business-led impacts with their concept of tripled tiered accountability or the triple bottom line can help 

 foster  outlooks  that  are  culturally  and  religiously  inclusive  and  that  accept  global  civic  values.  For  

 example,  contrary  to  the  perceptions  held  in  the  West  and  pedalled  by  some  autocratic  Confucian-heritage politicians, countries in eastern and northern Asia have had substantive historical, non-royalist 

 traditions in support of human rights as primary universal values. The non-royalist dictum, “The voice 

 of the people is the voice of heaven” sounds suspiciously like the Latin dictum, “Vox populi, vox Dei”. 

 

 15  CAHILL, Des  

 5.  The Interrogation by Faiths of their own Traditions 

 

 Lastly, religious traditions have an inherent tendency to be handcuffed to the past even if they are also 

 fundamentally  oriented  to  a  this-world  or  beyond-world  future.  In  the  creation  of  civil  societies,  

 religion cannot be  left to  one side. They are handcuffed  to  an imagined, if not imaginary,  past that is 

 often based on poor history. As Flaubert remarked, “our ignorance of history makes us slander our own 

 times”. There is ‘good’ religion , there is ‘bad’ religion; there are extremes in each religious tradition 

 that become locked into their enclosed world-view. Every religion has its cancers and potential cancers;  

 “what our world needs is men and women whose religious commitments are both clear and ambiguous, 

 rooted  and  adaptive,  particular  and  pluralistic,  yet  this  would  not  be  sufficient:  in  addition,  we  must  

 probe  our  traditions  so  that  we  can  identify  and  eradicate  the  pathologies  that  have  contributed  to  

 inquisitions,  holy  wars,  obscurantisms  and  exclusivisms…religiously  committed  men  and  women  

 (who) come to the public forum with powerful and necessary tools for the transformation of the world. 

 They bring the sacred into the public realm” (Boys, Lee & Bass 1995: 256).  

 

 Global faith communities would seem to have to confront one fundamental and three other challenges 

 in  interrogating  their  heritages  and  histories  in  a  future-oriented  way.  The  fundamental  one  is  the  

 attitude to religious pluralism, a religious pluralism that ensures peaceful co-existence and avoids any 

 evangelical  and  forced  missionization  but  allowing  conversion  and  reciprocity -  Ninian  Smart  (1996)  

 has developed the twin notions of “soft non-relativism” and “infederated complementarity” to inform a 

 religious pluralist view based on the three propositions (a) no world-view or revelation is susceptible of 

 proof,  so  certitude  is  not  possible  (b)  not  all  world-views  teach  compatible  theses  so  there  exists  a  

 rivalry even if there is considerable overlap - given the uncertainty, the only possible stance is soft non-relativism and  (c ) a multicultural stance implies a positive stance towards the different religions and  

 world-views which complement each other and have something to teach each other whilst they co-exist 

 in  a  world-wide  federation.  The  three  remaining  challenges  are  these  (1)  the  development  of  an  

 ecological  consciousness  that  recognizes  the  sacredness  of  the  universe  and  the  dangers  of  the  

 exploitation of the world’s non-renewable resources (2) the doctrinal and inpractice commitment to the 

 equality  of  male  and  female  in  and  beyond  their  structures  and  the  development  of  a  feminist  

 sensitivity  that  is  not  about  power  but  about  distributive  justice,  about  care  and  nurturance  and  the  

 importance  of  civilty  and  human  relatedness  (3)  commitment  to  the  spiritual  and  the  mystical,  not  

 being too distracted by their social and political lobbying activities and their welfare and educational 

 initiatives  and  (4)  the  commitment  to  social  justice  that  recognizes  that  all  women  and  men  have  an  

 inherent human dignity irrespective of whether they want to go to heaven or not. 

 

 

 

 16  CAHILL, Des  

 THE AUSTRALIAN CONTEXT 

 

 Faith  commitment  as  a  part  of  multicultural  Australia  has  been  largely  ignored,  which  is  surprising  

 given that the major confrontation in Australian society for the first 60  years of the 20th. century was 

 more faith- than ethnic-based (Catholic vs. Protestant).  After September 11th., there were two Islamic 

 facilities, one in Brisbane and one in Adelaide, that were set on fire; there was a marked increase in the 

 number of vandal attacks on Islamic mosques and, to a lesser extent, on some Jewish, Sikh and a few 

 Christian buildings; there were many verbal and physical attacks upon Muslims and Sikhs, particularly 

 upon  Muslim  women,  many  of  whom  were  afraid  to  venture  out  onto  the  streets  or  into  public  for  

 several  weeks.  Many  sections  of  the  media,  especially  the  tabloids  and  the  shock-jocks  on  talk-back  

 radio, with their audiences have targetted Islam, reflecting the widespread prejudice and ignorance that 

 exists  within  the  Australian  media,  especially  amongst  its  younger  members.  Islamophobia,  if  not  

 Islamo-hatred,  is  now  a  reality  in  Australia.  As  well,  there  has  been  among  educated  Australians  a  

 silent shift to an anti-Israeli government stance that must not be mistaken as anti-Semitic. 

 

 Equally importantly and much more positively, there has occurred an engagement with Muslim people, 

 who  themselves  have  realised  they  cannot  remain  within  their  own  spiritual  and  community  cacoon.  

 Across Australia, many multi-faith initiatives have occurred and this has created a new awareness and 

 understanding. After October 12th.,  negative reactions seem to have been less in number according to 

 the police evidence, perhaps because the police have been in a state of greater readiness. But there has 

 been plenty of hate mail and numerous minor incidents that have gone unreported. And, in a repetition 

 of  history,  we  have  had  police  raids  on  Muslim  family  homes,  recalling  the  raids  that  were  made  on  

 German  and  Italian  Australian  homes  during  World  War  II.  Ethnic  and  religious  leaders  have  been  

 under surveillance and their phones tapped as Western leaders, led by President Bush, have torn up the 

 rule books, and militarised the psyches of their peoples. Muslim leaders are now frightened, not at what 

 has happened, but what might happen if a terrorist attack occurred in Australia. The lucky country may 

 not be so lucky again. 

 

 Underlying all these developments has been a rise in the feeling, even amongst faith-committed people, 

 that, firstly, recent overseas conflicts such as the Gulf, the Balkans,  Sri Lanka and Central Asia have 

 put Australia’s social harmony at serious risk and, secondly, that religious extremism has the potential 

 to destroy the fabric of Australia’s civil, pluralist and democratic society. In both these concerns, there 

 is the feeling that perhaps Australia’s diversity has become too extended for the common good of an 

 aspiring civil society, and that ethnic and ethnoreligious leaders, especially Muslim leaders, need to be 

 called to greater accountability and scrutiny. 

 

 Australia’s Religious Profile 

 

 Reflections on the last census in 2001 reveal: 

 

 

 17  CAHILL, Des  

 â¢ the largest religious group in Australia remains Roman Catholic, just topping 5M for the first time 

 but  likely  to  slowly  decline  in  coming  decades  with  its  future  more  dependent  on  the  post-WWII  

 Catholic immigrants than on its traditional Irish base which has been alienated since 1968 by the 

 intransigence and incompetence of the hierarchy, especially on gender and sexuality issues 

 

 â¢ the total number of Christians continues to grow slowly but in proportional terms there will be a 

 similar  slow  decline  unless  there  is  a  Christian  revival  in  Australia  which  can  be  seen  only  

 amongst  the  more  pentecostal  and  evangelical  groups  many  of  whom  entertain  the  extreme  

 theological idea that “all other religions are the work of Satan”. The Anglican Church decline has 

 been  arrested  whilst  the  Orthodox  churches,  fearful  of  change,  remain  cacooned  in  their  own  

 ethnocratic worlds 

 

 â¢ the number of non-Christians continues to grow quickly, now representing almost five per cent of 

 the  total  population  and  probably  a  far  greater  proportion  in  actual  attendees  each  week  at   

 synagogue, temple and mosque; between 1996 and 2001, there has been a spectacular growth in 

 Buddhism (79% increase) and in both Hinduism (42%) and Islam (40%) and, intriguingly, in those 

 who gave an inadequate description (552%) with  over 70,000 stating that Jedi is their religious 

 icon. 

 

 â¢ there  has  been  no  growth  in  the  “no  religion”  category,  and  this  plateauxing  has  been  

 accompanied  by  a  rise  in  interest  in  spiritualities  of  all  kinds  because  the  organized  Christian  

 churches have remained locked into their pasts 

 

 At the moment, as we reflect on these statistics, we are seeing the coalescing of three historic shifts in 

 Australia: 

 

 (a)  the shift from a Christian to a paradoxically both multi-faith and secular society which has 

 highlighted,  at  the  national  level,  the  increasingly  necessary  search  for  transcendent  values,  

 symbols  and  sacred  sites  to  guide  the  nation  on  its  journey  into  the  future.  Should  a  cross  have  

 been placed on the tomb of the unknown soldier or should it have been a symbol that represents or 

 summarizes all the great traditions of spirituality? Should Parliament begin with a perfunctory Our 

 Father or a series of prayers and readings selected by each of the major religious groupings on a 

 rotational basis? Why do we not have in Canberra a sacred space or a national sacred site separate 

 from  Parliament  where  we  can  come  together  as  a  nation  for  our  national  celebrations  and  to  

 mourn  our  tragedies  such  as  that  at  Bali?  At  this  point  in  time,  we  should  rid  ourselves  of  the  

 notion of a secular society with its implication of an areligious or anti-religious stance, but speak 

 instead  of  a  civil  society  in  which  faith  communities,  like  other  social  movements,  have  their  

 place. This leads to the second shift. 

 

 

 18  CAHILL, Des  

 (b)  the  repositioning  of  the  relationship  between  religion  and  state  that  has  been  occurring  for  

 three decades. In Australia, religion and state have never been fully separated and nor should they 

 be  and  nor  can  they  be.  The  decision  in  the  early  1970s  to  grant  government  funding  to  private  

 schools  has  led  to  the  smorgasbord  of  schools  that  partly  reflect  Australia’s  cultural  diversity.  

 More  recently,  faith  communities,  especially  the  small  Salvation  Army  and  the  Catholic  Church,  

 have  won  the  contracts  for  employment  agencies  to  replace  the  Commonwealth  Employment  

 Service. Hopefully they are more caring than the old  CES, but should  all their personnel have  to  

 subscribe  to  “the  Christian  ethos”?  In  the  area  of  school  education,  what  are  the  limits  to  the  

 creation of a religious and moral ethos if, for example, a teacher enters into a de facto relationship, 

 or, as happened in Perth early in 2002 in a Christian Biblical school, a child was expelled because 

 his  mother  entered  into  such  a  relationship?  What  do  we  do  about  a  faith  community  whose  

 authority  structure  does  not  subscribe  to  the  Australian  core  value  that  males  and  females  are  

 equal? These are not questions with easy answers yet they are coming onto the agenda. 

 

 (c)  the third historic trend is more recent, and results from the interface between the formation of 

 religious  and  linguistic  diaspora  and  the  new  technologies.  Airline  transportation  and  the  

 internet  now  allow  religious  communities  to  establish  and  reinforce  their  global  linkages  which  

 can lead to greater support, co-operation and flows of updated and traditionally authentic thinking 

 through  a  global  faith  community.  There  is,  however,  a  downside,  namely,  that  extremists  and  

 zealots  can  use  cellular  phones  and  the  world-wide  web  to  assist  the  planning  and  execution  of  

 their deeds. The pogroms in Gujurat early in 2002 have been called the first cellular phone killings 

 (Lal 2002). They can construct websites that can be the intellectual basis for stirring up ethnic and 

 religious  hatred.  They  can  more  easily  spread  rumors  and  destructive  innuendoes.  For  example,  

 militant  Hindus  have  explicitly  rejected  the  non-violent  legacy  of  Mahatma  Gandhi.  What  is  

 happening is that some ethnic and religious groups, in explicit examples of the politics of memory 

 and  the  politics  of  grievance,  are  heavily  investing  in  their  own  skewed  and  racist  versions  of  

 history by constructing their own websites without any oversight by respected scholars (Lal 2002). 

 Of  course,  this  has  always  happened  but  the  books  and  pamphlets  could  not  be  so  easily  

 disseminated  whereas now dissemination is instant and  worldwide. Australia is part of the global 

 web, and Australian religious websites need to be monitored for their content. Leaders will have to 

 be  extraordinarily  sensitive  to  their  website  content  and  to  linksites  outside  Australia  whose  

 content can be bloodcurdling, and very destructive of inter-faith relations. 

 

 In making a response to our current predicament, I think we need to keep in mind two things: 

 

 1. Religion as a Positive, Constructive Force for Social Harmony 

       2. The Multi-Faceted Role of Religion in a Multi-Faith Society 

 

 1.  Religion as a Constructive Force

 It is commonplace to think,  sometimes rightly, that religion is a negative and divisive  force, not least 

 among  some  ethnic  community leaders  who  suffer  from a  unhealthy dose  of  anti-clericalism or  think  

 that religion is either irrelevant or even dangerous. Good religion reminds us that transcendent values 

 are at the core of national integrity, and central to Australia’s current crisis is a crisis over values. As an 

 example,  all  religions  have  hospitality as  a  core  value,  and  yet  the  boat  people  of  1788  could  not  be  

 hospitable to a few thousand boat people of 2001. In the M.V. Tampa affair Australia refused to accept 

 mainly Afghan Hazara refugees, fleeing the murderous, extremist zealotry of the Taliban - they had left 

 the island called Christmas, an event associated with family and good tidings, humanity and salvation, 

 and were transported to a phosphate Alcatraz. It highlighted that in Australia we did not have sufficient 

 social and moral capital to have a sensible debate on the situation. It was good theatre appreciated by 

 the  overt  white  Australian  supremacists  and  their  covert  fellow  travellers  on  talk-back  radio  as  they  

 negotiated  their  way  through  a  successful  but  immoral  electoral  campaign.   But  across  the  Muslim  

 diasporic  world  it  was  seen  as  yet  another  humiliation  and  act  of  Western  selfishness.  Several  weeks  

 later,  General  Mushareff,  the  Pakistani  leader,  in  an  interview  soon  after  S11  that  gained  very  little  

 publicity in Australia, complained  bitterly on CNN that Australia could  not be  bothered  taking a few 

 hundred  refugees  when  his  country  had  already  taken  hundreds  of  thousands.  We  had  demeaned  

 ourselves. 

 

 In Australia, faith traditions with their focus on the ultimate and  the absolute as well as the local and  

 the  universal  have  been  key  elements  in  the  formation  of  Australia’s  pluralist  society.  Religious  

 groupings  have  been  formative  of  core  social  and  moral  Australian  values  and  of  public  service,  

 welfare  and  philanthropic  traditions.  With  their  localised  presence,  their  community  ethic  and  their  

 universalist  outlook,  most  religious  groups  have  made  positive  contributions  to  the  construction  of  

 Australia’s multicultural society that has been recognized world-wide as a model and exemplar.  They 

 have  played  a  major,  if  unrecognized,  role  in  helping  to  assist  in  the  settlement  of  immigrants  and  

 making them feel welcome, in changing the attitudes of Australians in welcoming the stranger to  our 

 midst, in holding Migration Sundays and various festivals and conferences, in pressing governments to 

 implement  policies  and  programs  through  bodies  such  as  the  Ecumenical  Migration  Centre  and  the  

 Australian Catholic Migration Office, in creating a sense of belonging for immigrants and meeting their 

 spiritual needs often in their first language and, lastly, in defusing ancient hatreds brought to Australia 

 by immigrants and refugees as part of their cultural baggage. 

 

 2.  Role of Religion as Cultural, Counter-cultural and Cross-cultural 

 

 Religion  has  sometimes  acted  as  an  oppressive  or  divisive  force  such  as  in  the  suppression  of  

 Aboriginal  spirituality,  the  tensions  between  Protestantism  and  Catholicism  that  was  a  feature  of  

 Australian society until the 1960s and the tensions between certain immigrant communities as a direct 

 result  of  hostilities  in  their  home  countries.  In  more  recent  times,  some  religious  groups  could  have  

 been more proactive and assertive in assisting their communities to address specific issues such as the 

 AIDS  threat,  sexual  corruption  and  the  gambling  epidemic.  However,  religion  at  its  best  remains  an  

 

 20  CAHILL, Des  

 asset  and  a  resource.  Religion  can  become  a  divisive  force  if  integrated  into  a  dangerous  

 ethnonationalism  or  can  be  manipulated  in  such  a  way  to  foment  rebellion  and  division  that  may  be  

 odds with its altruistic message and universalist strivings.  

 

 At their best, however, faith communities should be cultural, counter-cultural and cross-cultural both in 

 word and in practice, and not be counter-productive. Each faith community needs to interrogate itself, 

 its  beliefs  and  its  actions,  and  make  the  appropriate  diagnosis.  Whilst  their  faith  traditions  are  

 necessarily based on memories of past events and religious figures such as the Buddha, Abraham, Jesus 

 and  Muhammed,  religious  leaders  cannot  indulge  in  or  encourage  their  members  to  indulge  in  the  

 politics of memory, the politics of grievance or the politics of retribution; instead, they must be future-oriented in imagining new initiatives and walking down new paths. 

 

 Firstly, faith communities should be cultural in two senses (a) creating social capital for the social and 

 economic  well-being  of  Australia  as  part  of  their  commitment  to  the  future  of  this  country  and  (b)  

 maintaining  and  developing  the  group’s  cultural  and  linguistic  heritage  down  the  generations  and  

 assisting the group to maintain its image and reputation. We can label these two aspects national social 

 capital  and  group  social  capital.  Social  capital  which  is  built  around  bonds,  bridges,  links  and  

 acceptance  of  the  other  indicates  the  processes  that  facilitate  individual  and  social  well-being  and  

 positive communal and societal outcomes within a nation or a group. A nation’s social capital is built 

 on  an  accurate  understanding  of  its  past  through,  firstly,  solid  but  flexible  social  institutions  that  are  

 resistant to corruption, fanaticism and zealotry and are able to deal constructively with the multilayered 

 national and international flows of ideas, finances, peoples, technologies and media images. Secondly, 

 it  is  further  constructed  through  facilitative  modes  of  communication  and  association  between  and  

 across  individuals,  organizations  and  collective  institutions,  all  underpinned  by  (I)  positive  

 psychosocial  characteristics  such  as  openness  to  new  challenges  and  ambiguities,  the  tendency  to  

 modernity and  long-sightedness,  the  propensity for  care,  nurturance  and  honesty and  the  readiness  to  

 trust people and institutions and (II) positive cultural and religious values, norms and behaviours that 

 produce  success  in  economic,  political,  military,  recreational  and  other  endeavours.  As  John  

 Montgomery  has  commented,  social  capital  “is  not  displayed  in  almanacs,  stock  market  reports  or  

 tourist advertisements; its presence has to be discovered through intuition or diligent rationalism. Yet it 

 is  ubiquitous;  it  is  so  often  invoked  to  enhance  desired  behaviour  in  the  present  or  to  bring  about  

 purposeful change for the future” (Montgomery 2001: 1). It is reflected in the stability and solidity of 

 institutions; it highlights trust and its maximization in public life; it underpins and influences the flows 

 of  communicating  and  associating  between  individuals  and  collective  entities  like  religious  

 communities  and  ethnic  groups  and  between  nations;  it  gives  nations  competitive  advantages  in  the  

 international economic race or in responding to international crises and national disasters; it can help to 

 achieve  social  justice  by  improving  distributive  justice;  it  can  foster  and  facilitate  grassroots  change  

 and initiatives. But like the two-edged sword, it can, at its worst, destroy all these things. And religious 

 leaders,  like  educational  and  all  other  community leaders,  can  enlarge  the  stock  of  social  capital  and  

 help choreograph social and ethnic cohesion in complex societies and across the world. 

 

 21  CAHILL, Des  

 

 Secondly,  faith  communities  ought  be  counter-cultural  in  pointing  to  and  showing  up  the  wrong,  

 misguided actions and false values of government, its institutions and of individuals misguided in their 

 lust  for  power,  sex  or  whatever  god.  This  is  called  the  prophetic  voice  of  faith  in  challenging  

 corruption, hypocrisy and mistaken directions. We have seen this recently in the churches’ opposition 

 to gambling. Civil societies need to give to religion the social and political space to play this role since, 

 because of their grassroots contact, faith communities are often the first to detect an emerging issue. 

 

 Thirdly, all faith communities need to be cross-cultural, that is, an outward orientation that is part of 

 the universalism that is at the authentic core of all religious traditions. All local faith communities need 

 to  develop  their  own  theologies  of  ‘the  other’  and  ‘the  different’,  and  interrogate  their  traditions  for  

 attitudes such as “other religions are the work of Satan”, variously expressed to me as I have travelled 

 around  Australia  and  interviewed  religious  leaders  in  recent  months.  Such  negative  sentiments  could  

 form the religious base for prejudice and racism. Mainstream Christians over the centuries, after much 

 struggle,  condemned  the  proposition, Extra  Ecclesiam  nulla  salus  (outside  the  Church  there  is  no  

 salvation), which, in a multi-faith context could be rephrased, “Outside our own faith community, there 

 is no heaven or resurrection or reincarnation but only hell or annihilation or a damned next existence”.  

 

 All  faith  communities  tend  to  be  wrapped  up  within  themselves  having  little  contact  with  other  

 different faith communities. This is particularly so where the particular community is not multicultural 

 in  composition  and  where  religion  and  ethnicity  are  closely  aligned.  They  can  become  encapsulated  

 within their own private world. It seems to me we need to develop strategies to break these barriers and 

 borders  down,  especially  at  the  local  government  level.  The  objective  must  always  be  to  defuse  and  

 provide antidotes to religious extremism and to religious encapsulation. 

 

 

 Particular Issues to Address 

 

 In  developing  strategies  to  facilitate  inter-faith  harmony  and  to  inoculate  ourselves  against  religious  

 extremism,  there  are  some  issues  that  I  feel  need  to  be  put  on  the  table  of  Australian  social  and  

 educational policy: 

 

 1. the preparation and education of local faith leaders and religious counsellors, particularly those 

 newly  arrived  in  Australia,  regarding  their  English  language  levels  and  their  capacity  to  act  

 interculturally and be attuned to the sensitivities of a multicultural society 

 

 Some faith communities, especially the recently arrived, do not have educational facilities for training 

 their  own  clergy.  Australia  would  be  a  richer  community  if  Buddhist,  Hindu  and  Islamic  training  

 centres could be facilitated as soon as possible. It has thus become necessary for them to import their 

 religious personnel. Often they are poorly trained and do not understand the sensitivities of functioning 

 

 22  CAHILL, Des  

 in  a  multi-faith  community.  As  well,  they  are  not  fluent  English  speakers  nor  knowledgeable  about  

 Australian social and political practices, yet they immediately step into positions of influence through 

 their preaching and counselling. They are not able to represent their community in the broader society 

 nor learn about this society and its strengths, which is to the detriment of all. 

 

 2.  the  curricula  within  both  government  and  private  schools  regarding  the  knowledge  of  children  

 about  religion  generally  and  about  the  major  faith  traditions,  especially  those  with  a  historical  

 heritage of tension and opposition 

 

 Whilst  there  are  variations  across  the  different  state  government  schooling  systems,  religion  is  

 generally not taught about in government schools which, more and more, have visioned themselves as 

 secular rather than civic schools. Knowledge about different religious traditions has now become  key 

 knowledge in the global ecumene, and yet there is extraordinary resistance to incorporating this type of 

 knowledge  into  government  school  curricula.  Private  religious  schools  have  a  different  kind  of  

 problem. We now have to begin asking the following kind of questions: what do Jewish schools teach 

 about Islam? What do Catholic schools teach about Buddhism? What do Muslim schools teach about 

 Christianity?  There  needs  to  be  much  more  interaction  and  co-operation  between  these  types  of  

 schools,  and  they  need  to  incorporate  curriculum  modules  about  inter-faith  understanding  into  their  

 religious education programs and have interaction with students from other faiths. 

 

 3. the format of multi-faith  services at times of national celebration or of national or international 

 tragedy, and the form of symbols such as the use of the Christian cross and the saying of the Our 

 Father in Parliament 

 

 This raises the issues of symbols,  and whilst Australian society has accommodated different religions 

 reasonably well, we need imagination to resolve this set of issues which pertain to other issues such as 

 sacred spaces in hospitals and nursing homes and the use of oaths at police graduations. The difficulty 

 will  be  balancing  the  thinking  of  the  69  per  cent  of  Australians  who  subscribe  to  Christianity,  those  

 from the minority faiths and those who are professedly agnostic or atheist. However, it is important to 

 avoid a lowest common denomination solution which would be the desire of the secularists for this will 

 only exacerbate the problem. 

 

 4. the creation of mechanisms for co-operation and dialogue at local grassroots level between ethnic 

 and religious communities that are genuinely multi-faith and aim at local community well-being 

 

 Creating  a  harmonious  society  occurs  at  local  level,  and  it  is  instructive  that  Hansonism  found  its  

 greatest  strength  in  communities  with  the  fewest  immigrants.  Many  initiatives  have  occurred  since  

 September 11th. but these need to be reinforced through formal local government support which brings 

 together local ethnic and  religious community leaders, not primarily to  have  a theological or  spiritual 

 

 23  CAHILL, Des  

 dialogue, but a multilogue (to use the phrase of Prince Hassan of Jordan) focussed on group community 

 action.  

 

 5.  the  special  situation  of  the  Australian  Muslim  community  as  results  of  the  USA,  Bali  and  other  

 attacks across the world 

 

       The  Muslim  communities  need  our  special  support  at  this  dangerous  time,  and  it  cannot  be  

 guaranteed that our institutions will not let us down in the face of immense provocation. It seems to me 

 that  Islam  in  Australia  needs  to  become  a  more  united  and  cohesive  force  without  ethnoreligious  

 fiefdoms and imams self-appointing themselves to various positions. It is also important to support the 

 moderates, and for all of us to engage with all sections of the Muslim communities in Australia. They 

 need assistance in their public relations efforts to combat the bigoted opinions of the tabloids and the 

 shock-jocks, and they should be encouraged to build a Muslim Institute, engaging the best international 

 scholars to teach the authentic Islam,  especially to its imams arriving from other countries, and to its 

 people here. Now that they have more than twenty-six schools across Australia, other government and 

 religious schools ought engage them in exchange visits, debating contests, sporting contests etc.. At the 

 same time, they need to accept inspection of their curriculum and teaching practices to assure the broad 

 community that anti-Christian and anti-Jewish propaganda is not infecting the minds of young Muslim 

 Australians. It would be helpful that their mosques are developed not just as prayer halls but as local 

 social  and  recreational  centres  in  accordance  with  the  centuries-long  tradition  of  Islamic  architecture.  

 Lastly,  it  seems  opportune  that  Australia  develops  a  charter  of  religious  pluralism  and  inter-religious  

 interaction  to  ensure  “fair  and  honourable  competition”,  to  use  the  phrase  of  Professor  Gary Bouma,  

 between the different faiths. 

 

 Conclusion 

 

 In  conclusion,  in  the  creation  of  civil  societies,  religion  cannot  be  left  to  one  side.  There  cannot  be  

 peace and harmony unless there is peace and harmony between the religions. Martyrdom, whether self 

 or  inflicted,  occurs at the extremist of times. Self-martyrdom in particular is an act of despair, an act 

 that hopelessly hopes the world will take notice of their motivations and their grievances. Memories of 

 oppression, abuse and hatred will always come back to haunt us, even destroy us, if they are not dealt 

 with  constructively  and  with  hope.  And  with  vision.  Never  again  shall  we  be  able  to  look  again  at  

 skyscrapers in the same way in their ambiguous symbolism of the divine and the secular. In the face of 

 immense  provocation,  we  must  retain  our  nerve…and  retain  our  hope…and  be  rigorous  in  our  

 thinking….and be imaginative in our solutions. No one is without sin and, as Archbishop Tutu has said, 

 there  can  be  no  future  without  forgiveness.  And  through  our  networks  and  via  the  internet,  we  can  

 make  a  difference.  As  Hans  Kung  (1996),  one  of  the  driving  forces  behind  the  Parliament  of  the  

 World’s Religions, says, what is needed is “religiosity with a foundation but without fundamentalism; 

 religiosity with religious identity, but without exclusivity; religiosity with certainty of truth, but without 

 fanaticism”,  a  new  religious  cosmopolitanism.  All  the  great  religious  figures  of  history  have  been

 teachers - and education is at the core of the global faiths agenda. Extremists are highly selective from 

 the faith tradition they embrace. 

 

 In Amman late in 1999, for the first time, 23 religious leaders from Bosnia-Herzogovina were brought 

 together as a group, at least two decades, if not two centuries, too late. At the end of the colloquium, 

 the  Grand  Mufti  of  Bosnia-Herzogovina,  the  Orthodox  Metropolitan  and  the  Catholic  Cardinal  each  

 reported  that  the  only  antidote  to  the  radioactivity  of  hate  in  South-East  Europe  is  that  of  love  and  

 peace. The Mufti spoke of the “many problems in front of us” and the difficulty of “learning how to 

 communicate  with  each  other”.   He  commented,  “human  blood  has  no  nationality,  no  religion,  no  

 culture”. He concluded, and it is also my conclusion, “it is not a sin to go back into history but it is a 

 sin to stay in history”.
