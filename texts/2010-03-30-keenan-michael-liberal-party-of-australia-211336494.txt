 100 ILLEGAL BOAT ARRIVALS, 100 POLICY FAILURES   

 Tuesday, 30 March 2010    

 The arrival of the 100th boat since the Rudd Government rolled back the strong  border protection regime they inherited from the Coalition, marks 100 Labor  policy failures, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison  and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan  said today.      

 “It was Julia Gillard who said in opposition, 'another boat on the way, another  policy failure'. On Julia Gillard's benchmark Labor's 100 boat arrivals on the  Rudd Government’s watch, means one hundred Labor policy failures,” Mr  Morrison said.    

 “The arrival of the latest two boats has seen the Rudd Government set the  record for the most boats in a month and the most arrivals in a financial year,”  he said.    

 “In 2009/10 we have now had 76 illegal boat arrivals, the highest figure on  record with three months still to go.    

 “These are not records the Rudd Government should be proud of. There have  always been push factors, but Australia has not always been a soft touch. It took  the Rudd Government to achieve that.    

 “The Rudd Government inherited a solution and created a problem. 100 boats  later they are still in denial.    

 “Under this government people smugglers are in charge of deciding who comes  to this country, Christmas Island is full, universal offshore processing is history,  asylum seekers are being sent to the mainland in secret night charters when  they should be sent home, detainees are escaping from detention centres and  the government attempts to counter these massive failures with a wall of spin.     

 “This is no way to run an immigration and border protection system. Australians  deserve better than Labor's tangled web of failed policy, flawed decisions and  border protection denial,” he said.    

 Mr Keenan said: “Despite the 100th boat arriving since August 08, the  Government continues to deny that they are buried in a crisis of their own  making.    

 “One of the latest illegal boat arrivals turned up directly at Christmas Island,  another clear indication that Border Protection Command are struggling to cope  with the strain imposed upon them by this reckless Rudd Labor Government  whose policies have started this massive influx.    

 “BPC cannot be everywhere at once and when you are getting an unprecedented  flood of illegal arrivals it makes it impossible for them to do their job effectively.  

 

 “This is the 11th boat this year alone to evade detection by BPC and arrive at  the shores of Christmas Island - the Government may as well just give each  Christmas Island resident a pair of binoculars and a 1800 number to call,” he  said.
