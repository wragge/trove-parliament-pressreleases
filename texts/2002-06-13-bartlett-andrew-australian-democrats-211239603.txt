  Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 13 June 2002  MEDIA RELEASE                          02/304

 Human toll of ‘Pacific Solution’ continues to grow The Australian Democrats say it is time for the Federal Government to acknowledge the growing human misery caused by the ‘Pacific Solution’ and start showing some leadership in our region on the issue of asylum seekers.

 Australian Democrats spokesperson for Immigration, Senator Andrew Bartlett said, “This situation continues to grow worse every day. On top of the continuing uncertainty for the people on Nauru, there are now reports that another boatload of asylum seekers may have sunk with loss of life.”

 “On Nauru we have the news that people who, at the time they travelled to Australia, were potential refugees. They have endured seven months of hell in a camp which, from all reports is even worse than those in Australia, only to be told by the United Nations that despite the fact that they are technically no longer refugees, it is unsafe for them to go home.

 “Our Minister coldly explains that the asylum seekers can take money with them and if they have to face issues such as landmines and lack of infrastructure then so be it.

 “Minister Ruddock is missing the point.

 “Afghanistan is unstable. As a leading Pacific nation, Australia should be taking on the guardianship of these people until the United Nations declares it is safe to send them back.

 “This Government is acting selfishly.  Forcing an impoverished country to take on people in these situations only places more stress on the infrastructure and lessens the chance of long-term stability in the region.

 Senator Bartlett said the news that a boat had gone missing was a tragedy that the Australian Government should take responsibility for.

 “The Minister was using this boat for political gain, his latest attempt at scare mongering was laid firmly on the news of this boat, yet at no time did the Australian government liaise with the Indonesian government about ensuring the safety of people on a boat that the Minister’s office described as ‘rickety’,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “Instead they used the information that the Indonesian authorities were not allowing this boat to land but pushing it back out to sea to attempt to excise more of our territories from the Migration Act.

 “There is no need to point out how different this scenario would have been if it was a yacht that had gone missing in the region.

 “These two actions today only highlights the fact that despite the growing human cost of the ‘Pacific Solution’ this Government no longer has the ability to take a responsible, let alone compassionate role in world affairs,” Senator Bartlett said.
