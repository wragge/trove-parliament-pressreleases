 Iraqis Arrive From Nauru

 VPS 145/2004

 Four families are among a group of 23 Iraqi refugees who arrived in Australia this evening from the offshore processing centre in Nauru.

 The 23 were told earlier this month that they had been found to be refugees after fresh interviews and a reassessment of their status on the basis of  new information on conditions in Iraq.

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, said most of the 15 adults and eight children would be  joining relatives in Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and regional Victoria.

 ‘All of them have been granted three or five year secondary movement temporary visas. These visas are available to refugees who abandoned or  bypassed effective protection in a country of first asylum to travel to Australia as their preferred migration destination.’

 The Minister said a number of other Iraqis were still undergoing processing and would receive decisions in the new year.

 Those found not to be refugees were expected to return home as soon as circumstances permit.
