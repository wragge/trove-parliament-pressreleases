 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS BEAZLEY IS WRONG, WRONG, WRONG

 "It is utterly wrong for Mr Beazley to say that the regional conference suggested by Indonesia yesterday wasn’t a matter of government policy - the fact is that such a conference was discussed with Indonesia by the Government delegation at the beginning of September," Mr Ruddock said today.

 "It is also wrong for Mr Beazley to say that the government didn’t agree earlier to taking people assessed as genuine refugees under the regional cooperation agreement - the fact is the Government agreed to take 40 people assessed by UNHCR as early as May, and this has been in the public arena for months.

 "It is also wrong for Mr Beazley to say that the Labor Party had a policy about unauthorised arrivals before the Tampa crisis. They simply did not. I am not aware of one statement by the Labor Party on a strategic response to unauthorised arrivals before his speech to the Asia pacific institute.

 "In fact Mr Beazley has said that Australia is an "illegal immigration heaven". His Shadow Minister has said, "the fact is, its not a crisis". The fact is Labor kept its head in the sand for years on this issue.

 "The Labor Party come very late and ill-informed to these issues.

 "It is also wrong for Mr Beazley to say that Australia has not been working with the international community to address illegal migration at source."

 The Government has been pursuing a number of inititatives aimed at addressing the situation of displaced afghans in source countries in South-West Asia, including:

 Allocation of a total of $12 million in aid to assist displaced Afghans in 2000-01. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» an additional $23.3 million in 2001-02 has also been announced, of which $13.3 million has already been allocated to aid agencies. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The Government has also been working with the IOM since May 2001 on an information campaign that would highlight to displaced Afghans the dangers of using people smugglers.

 "The solution to the Afghan situation lies not in token resettlement efforts, but in a coordinated and concerted international effort to establish the political and social stability necessary for the rebuilding of Afghanistan", Mr Ruddock said.

 "The government recently co-sponsored a major international forum in Geneva to respond to the situation facing Afghan refugees and displaced populations.

 "This forum produced a massive donor response to the current humanitarian crisis, with many countries

 contributing a total of $700 million in aid.

 "The forum also focused on the development of long term responses to the situation of displaced Afghans", Mr Ruddock said.

 "The Government’s approach recognises that the problems of irregular migration and people smuggling are intertwined with unresolved and longstanding refugee caseloads around the world and the international community needs to work on developing comprehensive, integrated solutions to these problems."

 "However the Labor party comes very late and not well-informed to these issues. The comments by Mr Beazley, his shadow minister for immigration and the shadow foreign affairs minister demonstrates very clearly the significant lack of understanding and knowledge they have of this complex matter, as well as their lack of policy.

 "Labor’s only position is to misrepresent Government policy and then claim it as their own." Mr Ruddock said.
