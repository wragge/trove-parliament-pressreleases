 Minister to visit Indonesia 

 Tuesday, 15 January 2008 

 Senator Chris Evans, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship,  will depart for Indonesia tomorrow (Wednesday January 16) to  hold talks with his Indonesian counterpart, the Minister for Law  and Human Rights, Mr Andi Mattalatta. 

 Senator Evans said the talks would focus on strengthening  Australiaâ€™s relationship with Indonesia in dealing with migration  issues, including border security and people smuggling.  

 'Indonesia is a key partner for Australia and we are committed to a  close, practical working relationship on issues of mutual interest,'  Senator Evans said.  

 'I intend to promote an understanding of Australian Government  views, and to renew and intensify our commitment to a robust and  supportive relationship with Indonesia. 

 'The Australian Government recognises the crucial role that  Indonesia plays in regional border security and preventing the  illegal movement of boats organised by people smugglers.'  

 Senator Evans said the Department of Immigration and  Citizenship was working with Indonesian immigration officials to  develop a state-of-the-art movement alert system to provide  Indonesia with a greater capacity to identify people of concern,  such as terrorists, criminals and people smugglers. 

 'A key benefit of close cooperation with Indonesia is improved  border security for both countries,' Senator Evans said. 

 'Projects like these help make travel in the region safer and more  secure.' 

 Senator Evans will also have discussions with the Indonesian  Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr Hassan Wirajuda, representatives  from the Indonesian Parliamentary Commissions on Legal Affairs  and Foreign Affairs, and regional representatives of the 

 International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Office of the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). 

 'IOM is a major partner in the delivery of many Department of  Immigration and Citizenship programs in Indonesia,' the minister  said. 

 'Likewise, the UNHCR plays a crucial role in dealing with the  situation of asylum seekers in the region and addressing  protection issues. 

 'I am confident that the visit will provide the basis for us to identify

 further opportunities for us to work together in other areas of  mutual interest and benefit. 

 'A robust immigration program also benefits both countries through  forging closer people-to-people links and we have seen a steady  growth in Indonesian visitors to Australia with nearly 60 000 visitor  visas granted last year.' 

 Senator Evans will stop off at Christmas Island en-route to Jakarta  to visit the nearly-completed immigration detention centre (IDC). 

 'The new centre is scheduled to open in the coming months and  will provide an increased capacity for offshore processing of  unauthorised arrivals,' Senator Evans said. 

 "The facility will house 400 people with a surge capacity for a  further 400.  

 'The Australian Government is committed to dismantling the  Pacific strategy. The Christmas Island IDC will play a key role in  the orderly processing of unauthorised arrivals to our country,' 

 Senator Evans added.
