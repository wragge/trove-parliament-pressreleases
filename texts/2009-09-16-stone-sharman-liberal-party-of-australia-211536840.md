 FOURTH BOAT IN A WEEK: THE BEDLAM CONTINUES 

 The Hon Dr Sharman Stone MP  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 The Rudd Government must acknowledge the need to act immediately following the arrival of yet another boat 

 overnight carrying asylum seekers, the fourth in the last week, Dr Sharman Stone, Shadow Minister for 

 Immigration and Citizenship, said today.  

 “At this rate we are looking at more than 8000 annual unauthorised arrivals,” Dr Stone said.  

 At about 9pm last night a boat carrying 62 unauthorised arrivals was intercepted by Border Protection, 230 

 nautical miles north of Broome. Since Tuesday last week four boats carrying 218 passengers have been 

 intercepted on their way to Australia. As well, on September 12, Indonesian officials detained 56 Afghanis off the 

 Eastern Island of Lombok who were attempting to travel to Australia.  

 Since the Rudd Government began unravelling its immigration policies in August 2008, 32 boats carrying 1518 

 unauthorised arrivals have been guided to Christmas Island.  

 “It is clear to everyone, except the Rudd Government, that their border protection policies have comprehensively 

 failed and have sent the wrong message to people smugglers,” Dr Stone said.  

 “It is not much comfort to know that our border security services are offering an excellent chaperone service for 

 the boats in their last run to Christmas Island.  

 “The detention centres in Indonesia are filling with those intercepted on their way to Australia. Christmas Island is 

 filling up and all this government does is ask for applause for what they refer to as “another successful” 

 interception in our waters.  

 “How much more evidence does the Rudd Government need? The Prime Minister must urgently launch an 

 inquiry into the relationship between their softening of border protection and the surge in people smuggling in 

 Australia.”
