 HOBSON’S CHOICE - NOT “WORK CHOICES”   

 

 John Howard’s Radical Industrial Relations Regime and its  Incompatibility with ILO Standards   

 

 Address to the  Australian Workers Union  Sydney   

 

 Kevin Rudd, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trade and International  Security   

 

 25 November 2005   

 

 Tobias Hobson ran a thriving carrier and horse rental business in Cambridge,  England, around the turn of the 17th century. 

 Observing that the Scholars rid hard and  were prone to choose his best horse, his  manner was to keep a large Stable of Horses ... when a Man came for a Horse, he  was led into the Stable, where there was great Choice, but he obliged them to take  the Horse which stood next to the Stable-Door; so that every Customer was alike  well served according. 

 In no time, people adopted Hobson's Choice to mean "an apparently free choice  when there is no choice at all" in situations having nothing to do with horses.   

 Hobson ’s Choice is in fact the better name for Work Choices - John Howard’s  new industrial relations regime.   

 The truth is that under Work Choices there is no real choice at all.   

 Upon entering John ‘Hobson’ Howard’s new stable you will be given but one  horse to ride.     

 A radical hack registered as AWA, sired by Ideological Obsession, out of Work  Till You Drop.   

 

 Work Choices offers no choice at all.     

 It is extreme, unfair and irresponsibly will send Australia down the lower  skilled, lower paid, lower productivity path.     

 This is not a vision for a smarter Australia.   

 This is not a vision for a knowledge nation.   

 Nor is it a vision for a more competitive Australia.   

 It is a tired man’s tired dream that unfortunately will become the reality very  soon.     

 

 The Government has failed to put forward any rigorous economic analysis  supporting the introduction of this extreme agenda.     

 In fact, it has failed to put forward any economic analysis full stop.     

 At least it hasn’t released any.     

 That is because there is no supporting evidence that individual contracts enhance  productivity.     

 But there is plenty of evidence to the contrary.     

 Plenty of evidence that this Bill will further undermine Australia’s productivity  growth and further undermine our international competitiveness.     

 That is bad for Australian exporters, bad for future job growth, bad for the  economy and of course bad for working families.     

 Today I want to focus on three key areas:         

 â¢ The Howard Government’s consistent violation of International Labour  Rights since it came to office in 1996.     

 o Work Choices continues that violation - indeed it undermines  Australia’s international obligations even further.     

 â¢ Australia’s declining productivity which has contributed to our appalling  trade performance; and  

 

 â¢ The fact that Work Choices will do nothing to enhance productivity  growth.     

 o Rather it is likely to exacerbate that deterioration - further  undermining our international competitiveness and further  undermining our trade performance.     

 

 INTERNATIONAL LABOUR STANDARDS   

 The International Labour Organisation is the UN’s specialised agency that  pursues the promotion of social justice and internationally recognised human  and labour rights.     

 The ILO was founded in 1919 and is the only surviving major creation of the  Treaty of Versailles which brought the League of Nations into being and became  the first specialised agency of the UN in 1946.     

 The ILO operates on the basis of a tripartite structure where representatives of  workers and employers enjoy equal status with those of governments and where  ILO standards are adopted with the support of unions, governments and  employer representatives.     

 Australia has a strong and proud association with the ILO.     

 We were a founding member in 1919 and have been an active and constructive  contributor to its activities and promotion of workers’ rights across the globe.     

 At least that was the case until the election of the Howard Government.     

 Since that time, Australia’s contribution to the ILO and respect for fundamental  workers rights and standards has been significantly diminished.     

 Under John Howard, Australia’s ILO obligations were immediately breached by  the Workplace Relations Act in 1996.     

 Despite that - and herein lies the hypocrisy of the Prime Minister - Australia was  elected to the Governing Body of the ILO representing the Asia Pacific region in  June of this year.     

 At that time Minister Andrews claimed that:    

 ‘Australia has much to offer ILO members and we look forward to greater  engagement with the ILO, both as a Governing Body member and representative  of our close neighbours’.       

 Well the Minister should be aware that being elected to the ILO Governing Body  brings with it additional responsibilities - particularly, the responsibility to lead  by example and show genuine substantive commitment to the principles of the  ILO.     

 Australia has never been a country to sign up to international law or conventions  just for the sake of it.     

 We have always carefully considered the implications of committing to such  agreements before proceeding to do so or, alternatively, deciding not to commit  if we did not believe it was in our interests to do so.     

 Such careful consideration reflects a proper political and policy perspective that  we should not commit to such agreements unless we genuinely believe in the  policy objective - and genuinely believe we have the capacity and willingness to  adhere to our obligations.   

 

 That has been the case right across the broad spectrum of international policy  including trade, environment, defence and human rights obligations.     

 It was most definitely the case in regard to our observance of ILO conventions.     

 Almost all of the ILO conventions have been accepted by Australia, and as a  result we are under an obligation to ensure that these standards are met in  domestic law and practice.     

 There are two fundamentally important ILO conventions.     

 They are:   

 â¢ No 87 - Freedom of Association and the Right to Organise Convention;  and  â¢ No 98 - Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining.     

 Respect for the principle of freedom of association is regarded as so important to  the operation of the ILO that the obligations to do so are regarded as inherent in  the fact of membership of the Organisation.     

 This is reflected in the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at  Work adopted by the International Labour Conference in 1998 which declared  that:     

 “…all Members, even if they have not ratified the Conventions in question, have an  obligation, arising from the very fact of membership in the Organisation, to respect,  to promote and to realise, in good faith, the principles which are the subject of those  Conventions, namely:    

 (a) freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective  bargaining.”      

 As pointed out by the International Centre for Trade Union Rights in its  submission to the Senate Inquiry into the Work Choice Bill, the 1998 Declaration  was accepted by the Howard Government.     

 In 1999, the then Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small  Business, Peter Reith told the ILO Conference that:     

 “The Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, which has the  firm support of the Australian Government, is a significant milestone on the road  to reform of the standard setting process.  The Australian Government’s  workplace relations legislation reflects our respect for the fundamental principles  in the Declaration.”      

 Well there is a yawning gap between the Government’s commitment in theory  and the Government’s implementation in practice of its ILO obligations.     

 Since the implementation of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, the Government  has accumulated a lengthy list of ILO Convention breaches that attest to its  complete disregard for basic human and worker rights.     

 Let me detail its track record.     

 In 1998, the ILO Committee of Experts found that the 1996 Workplace Relations  Act contravened Convention 98 by:    

 â¢ Favouring single-business agreements over other levels of agreements;   â¢ Failing to promote collective bargaining as required by Article 4 owing to  the primacy of AWAs; and  â¢ Limiting the scope of negotiable issues.     

 In 1999, the ILO Committee of Experts expressed concern about the limits on the  right to strike contained in the 1996 Workplace Relations Act.  Three areas of  particular concern were identified:    

 â¢ Restrictions on the subject matter of strikes, including the effective denial  of the right to strike in the case of the negotiation of multi-employer,  industry wide or national level agreements;  

 â¢ The prohibition of sympathy action; and   â¢ Restrictions beyond essential services.     

 In June of this year, the ILO again strongly criticised the Government for its  failure to meet its international obligations to protect the rights of workers to  collective bargaining arising from the provisions of the Building and  Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and Act 2005.     

 And just this week, the ILO upheld another ACTU case taken against the  Howard Government’s Building and Construction Bill in regard to freedom of  association.     

 The ILO recommended that the Government:    

 â¢ Amend the Construction Bill to ensure that any reference to unlawful  industrial action conforms with freedoms of association principles;    

 â¢ Change the Bill to eliminate excessive impediments, penalties or sanctions  against industrial action in the building and construction industry;    

 â¢ Review the Bill to ensure the determination of the bargaining level is left  to the discretion of the parties and is not imposed by law; and    

 â¢ To keep the ILO informed of relevant developments.     

 So the Howard Government already has a litany of ILO findings and criticisms  against it for failing to meet basic and core labour standards.     

 And that is before the ILO has even had the opportunity to assess the Work  Choice Bill.     

 Sharan Burrow has indicated that the ACTU will lodge an action in the ILO  about Work Choices once it is enacted by the Parliament.     

 Work Choices contains several provisions dropped from the final version of the  Building and Construction Bill but subject to the ACTU’s original ILO complaint  about the 2003 Building Bill.     

 

 Given the ILO’s findings so far on the Government’s industrial relations laws  already enacted there is a reasonable prospect that major aspects of Work  Choices will also be found to violate ILO conventions.   

 

 In this regard the International Centre of Trade Union Rights (ICTUR) in its  submission to the Senate Inquiry suggests that the Bill will worsen Australia’s  already long list of ILO breaches in at least eight initial ways including:    

 â¢ First, the prohibition on “pattern bargaining” in the 2005 Bill which would  result in an amplification of major breaches of ILO Conventions 87 and 98  identified by the ILO Committee of Experts - i.e. by further restricting the  right of employees and their representatives to bargain and take industrial  action in support of multi-employer or industry-wide collective  agreements.     

 â¢ Second, the prohibition on the incorporation of a range of matters in  workplace agreements which is likely to include trade union training  leave, mandating union involvement in dispute resolution and provide a  remedy of unfair dismissal, represents a severe, unnecessary and  impermissible restriction on collective bargaining and further compounds  Australia’s breach of ILO Convention 98.   

 â¢ Third, under the 2005 Bill an AWA will wholly displace a collective  agreement for the life of the AWA.  The Bill severely curtails the efficacy  of collective agreements vis-Ã -vis AWAs in flagrant disregard of both  Australia’s obligations under ILO Convention No 98 and previous  findings of the ILO Committee of Experts.        

 â¢ Fourth, the right of entry provisions in the Bill would reduce union access  to workplaces in a way which would: further impair workers’ freedom of  association and the right to organise; undermine “right of entry” as a way  of ensuring compliance with industrial instruments; and unjustifiably  impede unions from operating effectively in both monitoring compliance  and organising and recruiting.     

 They are just some of the many potential breaches of ILO Conventions contained  in the Government’s latest Bill attacking hard-won workers’ conditions and  rights.     

 But not only is the Bill potentially in breach of Australia’s obligations as a  signatory of the ILO, it also falls foul of commitments made by the Government  under the US Free Trade Agreement.      

 A trade agreement in which the US forced John Howard to commit to basic ILO  standards.     

 How ironic is that?     

 Under Chapter 18 of the US FTA:   

 “The Parties reaffirm their obligations as members of the International  Labour Organisation (ILO) and their commitments under the ILO  Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its  Follow-up (1989).     

 Each Party shall strive to ensure that such labour principles and the  internationally recognised labour principles and rights set forth in Article  18.7 (of the FTA) are recognised and protected by law.”     

 And what are those rights set forth in Article 18.7?    

 Internationally recognised labour principles and rights means:    

 (a) the right of association; and   (b) the right to organise and bargain collectively.     

 So, through the US FTA the Government reinforced its commitment to meet ILO  obligations.   

 Through Work Choices not only will the Government be potentially breaching its  ILO obligations, but it will also be breaching its FTA obligations to the US.    

 So should we be surprised that the Government is prepared to trample all over  hard won conditions, awards, and the rights of working families in this new Bill?    

 Of course not.     

 The precedent was set in the Workplace Relations Act of 1996 and the Building  and Construction Industry Act of 2003.     

 Should we be surprised that the Government is prepared to ignore its  international obligations in regard to labour rights under the UN’s ILO  Conventions?    

 Of course not.     

 This Government has form in ignoring, trampling all over, criticising or attacking  various UN bodies when it suits its domestic political purposes.     

 â¢ In March 2000, Foreign Minister Downer unleashed on the UN  Commission on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination for having the  audacity to critique Australia’s mandatory sentencing laws on the  detention of aboriginal people.     

 â¢ In 2002, Downer again unleased on the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees over its criticism of the Government’s approach to the  mandatory detention of asylum seekers.     

 â¢ In July 2002, Australia was one of only eight countries that voted against  the UN Protocol on Torture; and     

 â¢ In the lead up to the Second Iraq War beginning in March 2003 the Prime  Minister and other members of his Government repeatedly attacked the  actions of the UN Security Council for failing to back the Government’s  determination to invade Iraq.     

 Australians cannot sit idly by while its government systematically traduces  Australia’s obligations under international law - together with our broader  commitment to the maintenance of the fabric of the multilateral order.   

 It is inconsistent with Australia’s long-term tradition of good international  citizenship going back to the days of Australia’s role in the foundations of the  United Nations.    

 It is also inconsistent with Australia’s overall national interests in having other  states (large and small) uphold the international order on whose stability our  stability ultimately rests. 

 

 And it is inconsistent with Australia’s specific national interests in having  developing economies apply ILO standards to the domestic labour laws under  which their economies operate.   

 

 INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS   

 In addition to the Government’s complete disregard for fundamental labour  standards John Howard is also hell bent on driving wages down.     

 Doing away with overtime, penalty payments, leave loadings and the like.     

 Let me remind you what Hobson Howard - then Shadow Minister for Industrial  Relations -- said at the 1992 ACOSS Congress:   

 “It is a strong view of ours that if anyone in this country makes a capital  investment than it ought to be possible to run that capital investment 24 hours a  day, seven days a week, without penalty or additional costs as to the time of the  day or night that the capital investment is run”.      

 And nothing has changed.     

 John Howard’s vision remains the 24 hour workplace, seven days a week  without penalty or additional costs for labour working overtime, night shift, or  public holidays.    

 It is not as if Australians are not already hard working men and women.   

 We only have to compare our current workplace arrangements with other  countries.      

 Australian employees worked an average of 1855 hours each in 2000 compared  to the developed country average of only 1643 hours in 2000 - “so Australians  take the prize as the hardest working workers in the developed world”.   

 

 A study by the International Labour Organisation found that Australia had the  fourth highest proportion of people who work 50 hours per week and that the  number of Australians working these hours had grown faster than in any  industrialised country over the past 20 years.   

 

 Australia is by no means overly generous when it comes to public holidays or  length of annual leave per year.     

 Japan has the most public holidays per year - 5 more than Australia in 2000.     

 While Australia’s current minimum annual leave of 20 days is consistent with  that offered in most OECD countries and around 5 days less than that applying  in many EU member states.   

 

 As noted earlier this week, by Dr Jill Murray, Senior Lecturer in Law at La Trobe  University, the Work Choices Bill does not set minimum or maximum hours of  work, except for the requirement of the of the 38 hour week averaged over 12  months       

 This means that the bill fails to protect a minimum period of daily rest.     

 In the 25 EU Member States it is a legal requirement that workers have at least 11  hours rest each working day.     

 Many countries go further and legally limit the ordinary hours of the working  day to eight or ten.     

 Most EU countries also designate a minimum of one day a week for rest - a legal  right not provided by the bill.     

 So the Howard Government wants us to work longer for less pay even though  we are one of the hardest working nations in the industrialised world, and under  the new arrangements workers will not even have the minimum right of one day  a week for rest.   

 

 

 THE ANSWER IS PRODUCTIVITY   

 Australia is not going to compete against China, India and other developing  countries on the wages front.     

 The Howard Government wants to drive us down that path when common  economic sense tells us that we have to improve our levels of productivity by  investment in skills, education, infrastructure and R&D.     

 On this front, Australia has been falling behind and as a result we are  experiencing our worst trade performance since the end of the Second World  War.     

 Australia recorded another trade deficit of $1.6 billion in September - the 44th  consecutive monthly trade deficit.     

 â¢ Last year Australia recorded its largest trade deficit ever of $25.5 billion  compared to a deficit of only $864 million in 1996;      

 â¢ That contributed to Australia’s record current account deficit last year of  $57 billion;    

 â¢ Blowing out Australia’s foreign debt to a record level of $430 billion  leaving Australia exposed to any sudden adverse change in sentiment by  international financial markets.     

 Despite Government assurances, any recovery in Australia’s trade performance  is turning out to be at best a very protracted affair.     

 Average annual export growth under the Howard Government between 1996  and 2004 has been less than half that achieved by Labor between 1983 and 1996 -  right across the board in commodities, agriculture, manufactures and services.      

 Alarmingly, this appalling trade performance has occurred at a time of extremely  robust world economic growth, record commodity prices and our best terms of  trade for 30 years.     

 Numerous reports from the RBA, IMF, OECD and others have attributed our  poor export performance to a range of factors including infrastructure  constraints, skills shortages and a lack of Government support and investment in  education, R&D, and innovation.  

 

 The combination of these factors has led to our worst productivity growth  figures in 19 years and we must reverse this slide.     

 As I outlined in the House of Representatives debate on this Bill - in the 90s,  Australia enjoyed the best run of productivity growth on record on the back of  the comprehensive economic structural reform program undertaken by the  Hawke and Keating Governments.    

 Compared to the US, Australia rose from 79 per cent of US productivity rates in  1983 to 86 per cent by 1998.    

 But since 1998, we’ve gone into decline.    

 We’ve now fallen back from 86 to 81 per cent, losing most of the gains of the  Labor years.   

 The OECD has said that ‘productivity measures consistently show that output  per person-hour in Australia is well below that in leading countries’.     

 That is a fundamental cause of our export decline and a threat to our future  economic growth and prosperity.      

 In announcing his Workplace Relations reforms in May of this year, the Prime  Minister said that:   

 “…our future living standards will rely largely on the productivity of our  workers and their workplaces…only through this (reform) will the full potential  for productivity gains in the Australian economy be realised.”   

 In advancing these claims the Government has not advanced any cogent body of  evidence.     

 It has not even tried to do so.     

 It has just asserted it as though it is fact completely ignoring the substantial body  of evidence to the contrary.     

 As a submission to the Senate Inquiry by 151 Australian Industrial Relations,  Labour Market and Legal Academics outlined:    

 “There is no persuasive evidence systematically linking industrial relations  systems and industrial relations chances to productivity improvement.     

 There are many reasons why productivity grows but industrial relations  legislative changes are not generally a source of productivity growth across  OECD countries”.     

 In his address to the Sydney Institute in July, the Prime Minister sought to claim  some productivity basis for his reforms on the back of New Zealand’s experience  with Employment Contracts.   

 

 It is evident from the detailed work of David Peetz that the radically different IR  paths taken by Australia and New Zealand in the 1990s lead to significantly  different outcomes in terms of productivity growth.     

 Australia moved towards a system of collective enterprise agreements, while  New Zealand shifted to individual contracts.     

 The result - Australia’s growth in labour productivity was far superior to New  Zealand’s year after year because collective agreements encourage more  harmonious workplaces while also enhancing greatly the industrial flexibility of  individual firms.   

 

 In fact New Zealand’s productivity fell below the levels it achieved in the 1980s -  and yet now at a time of falling productivity growth in Australia the Prime  Minister wants to go down the very same New Zealand path.     

 The Business Council of Australia has for some time been putting forward a  productivity enhancing agenda that goes to tax reform, business regulation and  addressing infrastructure constraints.   

 

 In its Submission to the Senate Inquiry, the BCA suggest the Work Place  Relations amendments will have productivity pay-offs but provide no  supporting economic analysis to justify such claims.     

 Work the BCA has had undertaken by Access Economics notes that reforms to  workplace relations policies have boosted the pace of productivity growth,  largely by linking wages more closely to enterprise-level performance and  productivity.   

 

 This point reinforces Peetz’s research referred to above that enterprise based   collective agreements drove Australia’s productivity in the 1990s - not enterprise  based individual agreements along the lines of New Zealand’s experience.      

 The Government has once again sub-contracted ACCI to assist in the hard sell on  its IR changes.     

 But it too fails to make any analytically rigorous case that AWAs will enhance  productivity growth.     

 In its submission to the Senate Inquiry, ACCI seeks to claim that such extreme  reforms are necessary to spark the next productivity surge.     

 Their supporting evidence is a grab bag of economic studies on labour market  reform in general, including the need to cut the minimum wage, ACCI’s  overriding credo of boosting profits by reducing wages.   

 As Peetz said in his appearance before the Senate Inquiry:    

 “When you look at the studies that are referred to by ACCI, very few of them  actually refer specifically to the sorts of things that are directly related to the  impact of the bill upon productivity.  In particular, the most important aspect of  the bill is the promotion of individual contracting at the expense of other methods  of wage determination.  A lot of the studies that are referred to are not about  productivity at all.”   

 

 The bottom line is that John Howard’s Hobson’s Choice is a triumph of ideology  over evidence.     

 It is a triumph of prejudice over reason.     

 It is a triumph of politics over economics as John Howard’s underlying political  agenda is straight forward - to crush organised labour.   

 Australia’s level of productivity could diminish further if these new laws lead to  significant disruption in the workforce and/or a reduction in investment in skills  and technology as employers seek to increase productivity by cutting wage costs  rather than investing in new plant and equipment and upgrading the skills of 

 their workforce.     

 Any further reduction in productivity will exacerbate our appalling trade  performance.     

 In their latest Long Term Economic Forecast for Australia, BIS Shrapnel  definitively state that:    

 “As it currently stands the proposed changes will do little to improve  labour productivity.”   

 And in a stark warning, particularly when our economy is burdened by record  levels of debt and significant external imbalances, BIS Shrapnel question the  whole basis of these reforms by also noting that:  

 

 “…it’s probably a bad time macro-economically to buy a fight on  industrial relations.”   

 

 CONCLUSION   

 It is a bad time to be going down this path when there are deep economic  uncertainties ahead.    

 It is a bad time to be going down this path when long-term productivity growth  instead should be being built on the back of education, skills, training, R &D and  infrastructure. 

 

 It is a bad time to be going down a path that has only one direction for  Australian working families.  

 

 Beyond these considerations, however, we are we embarking on a set of radical,  extreme and ideological changes that will further undermine Australia’s  adherence to fundamental internationally codified labour standards.     

 International labour standards that Australia has constructively participated in  the development of over many decades   

 International labour standards that are integral to a civilised international  economic order that seeks to eliminate (not encourage) exploitation in the  workplace.   

 International labour standards that Australia now as a member of the Governing  Council of the ILO should be even more fundamentally committed to upholding.   

 Australian working families deserve better than these laws.   

 Australia’s long-term competitiveness deserves better than these laws.   

 Australia’s international standing demands better than these laws.
