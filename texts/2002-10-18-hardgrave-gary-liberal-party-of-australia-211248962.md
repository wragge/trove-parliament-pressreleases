 QUEENSLAND CELEBRATES REFUGEE WEEK WITH CITIZENSHIP CEREMONY

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, today congratulated 21 refugees who made their citizenship pledge at a special Refugee Week citizenship ceremony in Brisbane.

 Those pledging citizenship had sought asylum in Australia from Iraq, Iran, Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia and Eritrea.

 The  ceremony,  in  conjunction  with  the  Australian  Red  Cross,  was  held  during  Austcare Refugee  Week,  an  annual  event  to  raise  public  awareness  of  the  world’s  estimated  20 million refugees and other people of concern.

 The Minister sent a message of congratulations to participants and encouraged all Australians to celebrate their citizenship on this special day.

 “Choosing to become a citizen is a very significant expression of your pride in being part of Australia's dynamic and diverse society,” Mr Hardgrave said.

 “I congratulate each of you for the commitment you have made to being part of Australia’s future.

 “Citizenship ceremonies such as these develop greater awareness of refugee issues in the community and acknowledge the contributions refugees make to our society.” Mr Hardgrave said.

 The Minister also launched the Queensland Migrant Settlement Plan for 2002-05 in Brisbane today.

 The Queensland Migrant Settlement Plan, an important element of the Commonwealth Government's National Integrated Settlement Strategy, outlines the framework for agencies to work together to optimise migrants’ settlement experiences to enable them to become full participants in Australia's multicultural society.
