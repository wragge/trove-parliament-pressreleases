 Budget 2008-09 - Rudd Government scraps Temporary  Protection visas 

 Tuesday, 13 May 2008 

 The Rudd Government has fulfilled another election commitment by  abolishing the unjust Temporary Protection visa (TPV) regime for asylum  seekers set up by the previous government. 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, said that  from early 2008-09, people found to be refugees will receive a permanent  visa, regardless of their mode of arrival. 

 Under arrangements put in place by the former government, unauthorised  arrivals who were owed protection under Australia’s international obligations  were only eligible for TPVs in the first instance. 

 It meant that refugees had no travel rights, reduced access to refugee  settlement services such as English language programs, employment and  income assistance, and could not be reunited with other family members. 

 About 1000 refugees currently in Australia on TPVs will now have their status  resolved and will be afforded the same benefits and entitlements as holders of  a Permanent Protection visa. 

 ‘Provided they meet security and character requirements, they will be granted  permanent residency in Australia and will not need to have their protection  claims reassessed,’ Senator Evans said. 

 ‘The Temporary Protection visa was one of the worst aspects of the Howard  government’s punitive treatment of refugees, many of whom had suffered  enormously before fleeing to Australia. 

 ‘There is clear evidence that the TPV arrangements did nothing to prevent  unauthorised boat arrivals and, in fact, arrival numbers increased not long  after the regime was introduced. 

 ‘Another disturbing effect of such harsh visa conditions was that more women  and children risked their lives with people smugglers on leaky boats. 

 ‘The scrapping of the TPV fulfils the Rudd Government’s commitment to  providing refugees with a fair and certain outcome.’ 

 As a result of the abolition of the TPV regime, any existing Temporary  Protection visa or Temporary Humanitarian visa holder will be processed for  permanent residency in Australia. 

 Senator Evans said the measure would not compromise the Government’s  commitment to protecting Australia’s borders. 

 ‘Unauthorised boat arrivals will continue to be detained and processed at  Christmas Island,’ Senator Evans said. 

 ‘The Government is firmly committed to maintaining strong border security  measures and we will continue to enhance our efforts to combat people  smuggling to Australia, in particular by working with other countries in the  region,’ the Minister added.
