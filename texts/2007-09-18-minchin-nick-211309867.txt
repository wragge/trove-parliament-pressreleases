 Labor spins its wheels in bureaucratic morass 

 Kevin Rudd has confirmed Labor is all spin and no substance by setting up a vast slew of new bodies and  reviews to cloak Labor’s policy laziness and political weakness, the Minister for Finance and Administration,  Senator Nick Minchin, said today. 

 “Voters should be greatly alarmed to learn that Kevin Rudd would set up no fewer than 67 new  bureaucracies and establish 96 reviews if elected later this year,” Senator Minchin said. 

 “Governments are elected to make decisions, not set up committees and establish complex and expensive  new bureaucracies,” he said. 

 “The bewildering array of new bodies, committees and reviews proposed by Labor is going to cost the  taxpayer dearly and further erodes Labor’s claims that they would fund new spending by their already  dubious $3 billion in alleged savings. 

 “A Rudd Labor Government would waste time and taxpayers’ money setting up new bureaucracies and  conducting myriad reviews, instead of getting on with the job of managing Australia’s trillion-dollar economy. 

 “This expansion in bureaucracy and red tape shows that the Labor Party has no plan for Australia’s future  and would be the supreme achievement of career bureaucrat Kevin Rudd, who has never taken a hard  decision and avoids hard questions. 

 “The Government will be keeping a close eye on this staggering proliferation of Labor’s proposed new  bureaucracies and reviews. 

 “Labor cannot camouflage its indecision by establishing new layers of bureaucracy and cannot disguise its  inexperience with a plethora of reviews,” Senator Minchin said.
