 TRANSCRIPT  OF  DOORSTOP,  12.30AM  (AEST),  PARLIAMENT  HOUSE,   PERTH    

 SUBJECT:     LABOR’S NEW APPROACH TO BORDER PROTECTION  AND ASYLUM SEEKERS    

 SMITH:           John Howard and his Government are out there saying Labor’s new  approach on cracking down on people smugglers and our new approach on  Temporary Protection Visas will somehow encourage people smugglers.  John  Howard’s out there running the ludicrous argument that because we’re increasing  penalties, cracking down on people smugglers, zero tolerance of people smugglers,  that somehow this will encourage them.  It won’t and it’s a ludicrous proposition for  him to argue.     

 Secondly he’s saying that our new approach to Temporary Protection Visas will  somehow encourage people to try and come here.  Well what John Howard needs to  explain to the Australian people is the fact there are nearly 9,000 people already in  Australia on Temporary Protection Visas.  They all came to Australia on his watch.   He said they were all refugees and nearly 4,000 of them have been part of the  community for three years and by the end of this year nearly 8,000 will have been out  in the community for between three to four years.  So while he’s out there arguing  that our new approach to Temporary Protection Visas will somehow encourage  people to come to Australia, he’s allowed 9,000 refugees to come Australia and live in  the community on Temporary Protection Visas.  Our approach  is a rigorous  approach, it provides an immigration system of integrity where we protect our  borders, where we make sure we have rigorous processes, and where people are dealt  with fairly and are not left out in limbo for three, four, five or six years.    

 

 JOURNALIST:            How has it been welcomed within the party?   

 SMITH:           I think it’s a perfectly appropriate policy.  I think it’s a very good  policy.  Mark Latham and I will take it to our National Conference and we will argue  for our policy on its merits.  I’m hopeful we will get that support.

 JOURNALIST:            Do you think that the policy is a vote loser?    

 SMITH:           The policy is a rigorous policy.  It matches the need for integrity in our  migration system.  We’ve got to have a system that the community has confidence in.   They will only have confidence in the system if there’s integrity to it.  And they will  also only have confidence in the system if it treats people fairly.  So our approach  cracks down on people smugglers, stops the worst excesses of people smugglers, and  treats people who come to Australia and live in the community in a fair and  appropriate way.  And I think the Australia community will generally respond well to  that.  It balances the need for a tough approach to people smugglers but a fair  approach to people who come to Australia and seek refuge here.    

 JOURNALIST:         Didn’t this issue cost you votes at last Federal election?       

 SMITH:           There was no point trying to win the next election by rerunning the last  one.  What I’m interested in is not the past, I’m interested in the present and the  future.  What we know at present is that john Howard is out there saying that our  approach to people smugglers and our approach to Temporary Protection Visas will  somehow encourage people smugglers to come to Australia.  If that’s the case, John  Howard has to explain how cracking down on people smugglers, how zero tolerance  for people smugglers can encourage them to come here.  The last time we saw a boat  come to Australia John Howard sent the people smugglers away.  He let go scot-free  so they could try again and again.  We say to the people smugglers don’t bother  coming, because if they do it’s more likely than not that they will end up spending the  rest of their life in an Australian gaol.    

 JOURNALIST:           Some people are saying that this policy is a cave-in to the Left.    

 SMITH            If it was a cave-in to anyone they would out there supporting it.  The  response so far has been generally “this looks like a move in the right direction from  our perspective, but we’re going to go to the National Conference and oppose it”.  So  if it’s cave-in to some people, I haven’t seen them out there wildly embracing it.  It’s  a cave-in for nothing except good policy.  It is a good policy because it gives  Australia a migration system of integrity that they can have confidence in.  It gives  people protection of our borders in a firm way.  It cracks down on people smugglers  and it makes sure that the people who come to Australia are dealt with in a fair way  when they seek our refuge.    

 JOURNALIST:           How do you respond to comments from the incoming Party  President?    

 SMITH:           Carmen’s views on this issue are well known.  The policy approach  that we crafted out yesterday isn’t shared by her.  That’s understood.  That’s why at  National Conference there will be a debate about these issues but I’m hopeful that  National Conference will support the approach that Mark Latham and I have outlined  because it gives us a migration system of integrity, treats people fairly and shows zero  tolerance for people smugglers.

 JOURNALIST:           Finally, Bob Brown has come out this morning just a short time  ago, saying that the Labor Party has failed the nation.    

 

 

 SMITH:           Bob Brown should worry about his approach to his policies.  I’m not  frankly interested in Bob Brown’s response to our policy.  He can go and craft out his  own policy.  Our policy approach I believe will be well regarded by the Australian  community.  It cracks down on people smugglers, it strongly and firmly protects our  borders, and when people come here seeking our refuge they are dealt in a speedy and  a fair way.  And if they are not refugees they go home.  If they are refugees then they  are treated appropriately and fairly in the Australian community.
