 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Tuesday 7 March 2016 

 Government’s Cambodia deal an expensive failure  

 The return of two refugees transferred from Nauru to Cambodia is a further indicator that  that Turnbull government’s resettlement program is an expensive failure. 

 ‘For this couple, who have been recognised as refugees, to be pushed to the point where  they feel their only option is to return home at considerable risk to their safety,  demonstrates just how bad conditions for people are in Nauru and Cambodia,’ the Greens  immigration spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young said. 

 ‘The $55 million spent bribing the Cambodian government to take only five refugees, three  of whom have now left, has been a blatant waste of tax-payers money. The Turnbull  government’s response to the global refugee crisis is clearly not working.’ 

 ‘The failure of the Cambodia deal is further evidence that the Turnbull government has no  Exit Strategy to get out of this offshore detention mess.’ 

 ‘The Greens want to see a fair and efficient regional system put in place to process people’s  claims  for  asylum  quickly  and  efficiently  and  bring  them  here  safely,  with  considerable  less   expense.’  Media Contact: Katie Robertson 0427 604 760
