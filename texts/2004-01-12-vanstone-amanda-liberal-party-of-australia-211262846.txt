 Senator Amanda Vanstone  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 

 More Migrants Settle in Regional QLD

 VPS 016/2004

 From Cairns and Rockhampton to Toowoomba and Mt Isa, more and more migrants are choosing to settle and remain in  regional Queensland.

 But we need to do more and the initiatives I announced today with the Acting Prime Minister, John Anderson, will help to  attract more migrants and refugees to Australia's regional areas. 

 At the last Census, some 20,530 people living in Cairns were born overseas, a majority of whom was born in England and  New Zealand.

 In Toowoomba, some 7,660 people were born overseas - again the top two birthplaces were England and New Zealand.

 In Rockhampton, 3,460 were born overseas, with a majority born in England and New Zealand. 

 And in Mt Isa, 2,140 were born overseas, with New Zealand and England again topping the list.

 In 2002-2003, some 650 visas were granted to people under State-specific and regional migration initiatives for Queensland.

 This is more than double the outcome of the 2001-02 financial year. 

 Since 1997-98 nearly 2,570 visas have been granted to people who were planning to settle in Queensland under the various  regional migration programs.

 Visa grants for regional areas are steadily increasing, but more can be done to assist regional Australia to get the people they  want and this is what the measures being announced today aim to do.

 From 1 July, qualified people who want to come to Australia as skilled migrants will be able to obtain a three-year temporary  residents visa if they commit to living and working in regional Australia. After two years they will be able to apply for  permanent residency.

 There is also a new visa for self-funded independent retirees to encourage them to settle in regional areas.

 Under this visa, participating state and territory governments will be able to sponsor self-funded retirees settling in regional  Australia. 

 Self-funded retirees provide an opportunity for Australia to benefit both from their capital investment and the money they  spend while in Australia.
