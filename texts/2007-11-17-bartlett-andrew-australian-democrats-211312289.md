 Media Statement  Saturday 17th November 2007

 

 SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT  Queensland Democrat Senator  QUEENSLAND’S ONLY INDEPENDENT VOICE IN THE SENATE 

 

 Queensland Democrats rally as Senate support grows heading  into final week   

 The Senate and balance of power was put centre stage at a rally this morning to support the re-election  bid of Queensland Democrat Senator, Andrew Bartlett. 

 Senator Bartlett said “The contest for the Prime Minister’s job may seem to be all but over, but the Senate  contest in Queensland and many other states will go right down to the wire.” 

 “If there is to be a change of government, it is crucial voters take out some strong insurance in the  Senate.” 

 Senator Bartlett identified workplace relations, climate change and environment, welfare, taxation,  Indigenous, refugee and human rights and affordable housing as just some of the key issues which will be  affected by the balance of power outcome in the Senate. 

 With more polling showing the Democrats in Queensland defying predictions of certain death, Senator  Bartlett said the party will be fighting every inch of the way right through the final week of the campaign. 

 Prominent human rights advocate Julian Burnside QC spoke at the Democrats event, urging  Queenslanders to keep Andrew Bartlett in the Senate. 

 Julian Burnside’s name, along with former head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet John  Menadue and more the 140 others, appeared in an advertisement in today’s Courier-Mail which also  urged a vote for Andrew Bartlett. 

 Two times Academy Awardâ¢ nominated independent film maker David Bradbury and prominent human  rights activist Fr Frank Brennan AO have also provided video testimonials in support of Senator Bartlett. 

 "It is quite possible that the major parties will take all the Senate seats in Queensland, leaving no truly  independent voice to speak up for Queenslanders, which is especially vital in balance of power  situations.” 

 “The preference decisions of other parties mean that voting number one for the Democrats is the best way  for Queenslanders to keep an independent, progressive voice in the Senate. 

  “Everyone is now claiming to be full of common sense and reason, but the record over the ten years I  have been in the Senate shows I have used the balance of power effectively and responsibly on a wide  range of issues,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
