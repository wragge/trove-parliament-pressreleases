 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH   

 13 October 2011   

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   DOORSTOP INTERVIEW   PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA    

 Subjects: Julia Gillard’s carbon tax; Migration Act amendment.   

 E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Yesterday was a day of betrayal and the spectacle of Labor ministers celebrating that betrayal will be the  kiss of death for this Government. The next election will clearly be not only a referendum on the carbon tax  but a referendum on politicians who break their promises, break their solemn pre-election commitments. We  will, should we form a government, we will rescind the carbon tax. We can, we will, we must to keep the  pressure off prices and to protect peoples’ jobs.   

 As for the Malaysia people swap legislation, well everyone knows what the Coalition thinks of the Malaysia  people swap. It’s a cruel deal for boat people, it’s a dud deal for our country. But the Government can put  offshore processing beyond legal doubt if it accepts our amendment and we have the legal advice of the  former Solicitor-General David Bennett that our amendment provides greater legal certainty as well as  stronger protections for people.   

 QUESTION:   

 Have you secured the support of Bob Katter to vote with the Opposition on this legislation?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I’m just not going to speculate on what crossbenchers might do and I’m just not going to comment on any  discussions I’ve had with them.   

 QUESTION:   

 You must be thrilled though that it appears you have the numbers to defeat the Government’s legislation?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, the Prime Minister I think obviously now has a test - does she face the parliament on this matter? She  said for weeks that this was absolutely vital, absolutely urgent. Let’s see whether she now wants to run away  from the parliament on this issue as well as on so many others.

 QUESTION:   

 Do you think it was appropriate for protesters to interrupt Question Time yesterday in relation to the carbon  tax?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Obviously people should adhere to the rules and the rules are that the galleries should listen in silence to  what’s happening in the parliament but I can understand why people are angry. People were lied to before  the election, they haven’t been listened to since the election. I can understand why people are angry but it’s  important at all times that we conduct our political discourse within the rules.   

 QUESTION:   

 Did any of your own MPs sign them in?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I’m afraid I have no information on that.   

 QUESTION:   

 If the bill is defeated how embarrassing is this for Labor and what does it say about their authority?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, a government which can’t control our borders, a government which can’t protect our borders is a  government which has forfeited its right to be considered an effective national government.   

 Thank you.
