 THE G-20’S OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD ON CLIMATE CHANGE   

 SPEECH TO MAKE POVERTY HISTORY FORUM, MELBOURNE TOWN HALL  THURSDAY 16 NOVEMBER 2006   

 *** CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY ***   

 

 

 I’m delighted to be on the panel today with Stephen Timms.   The British Government is leading the way on making poverty history.   Their commitment to the Millennium Development Goals is inspiring.   And I’m also delighted to be invited to speak at this Make Poverty History forum  today. The Make Poverty History campaign has been one of the most successful  examples of civil society moving government in history.    

 As Andrew has observed, the G-20 meeting here in Melbourne this weekend  represents a crucial opportunity to address global economic challenges.   And making poverty history is one of the starkest challenges for the global economy.   CLIMATE CHANGE IS A GLOBAL ECONOMIC CHALLENGE   But my purpose here today is to argue that climate change is the kind of global  economic challenge that we should be discussing at every international forum.   If left unaddressed, as the British Government’s Stern Report has warned, climate  change has the capacity to become one of the largest contributors to global poverty  the world has yet seen.   That’s why I want to make the case today that whenever the developed and  developing world come together to discuss the future challenges we all face,  discussion about climate change must play a central role.    

 I suspect many of you don’t need convincing of that.   The science and politics of global warming have been known for some time.   I know you’ve heard about the relevance of climate change for development at one of  the parallel sessions earlier today.   Climate change has grave implications for Australia. We need look no further than  the current drought and our ongoing challenges on water. 

 But in Australia there are enough climate change sceptics — or, to be kind, late  converts to climate change — to fill a whole cabinet room.   Addressing climate change must be a crucial part of Australia’s approach to global 

 development because the burden of climate change will fall predominantly on the  global poor.   In Australia’s case, the risk of not doing anything on climate change will fall heavily  on our Pacific neighbours.  

 This means climate change is not just an environmental and moral issue. The  implication of climate change for developing nations in our region and around the  globe mean that addressing climate change is central to defending Australia’s  national interest.   As a recent paper from Alan Dupont and Graeme Pearman published by the Lowy  Institute has warned, climate change poses ‘fundamental questions of human  security, survival and the stability of nation states.’   Rising sea levels. Extreme weather events. Collapsing eco-systems. The  contamination of fresh water with salt water. Increased water-borne diseases.  Threats to food security. Natural disasters. Risks to our energy security. The new  challenge of climate refugees.   As Sir Nicholas Stern warned me, when Bangladesh, the Netherlands and scores of  Pacific islands are underwater, it’s too late to act.    

 CLIMATE CHANGE SHOULD BE ON THE G-20’S AGENDA    

 The G-20’s mandate is to discuss key issues in the global economy.   But climate change — a topic of truly global economic significance — isn’t on the  agenda for this meeting.   Through a decade of climate scepticism, the Australian Government has denied  there’s an urgent problem.   Recently, however, with heat from the Stern review and a big shift in public  sentiment, the Australian Government has argued that if there is to be a new global  agreement on climate change, India, China and the United States must be on board.   Recently the Treasurer was asked about global emissions trading and said: “Well I  don’t think it is at all feasible if you have got large emitters such as the United States,  China and India that are outside the system.”   Well, India, China and the United States are all members of the G-20.   This meeting is ideal opportunity to discuss how to reduce the billions of tonnes of  carbon those countries produce each year.  

 

 In addition to the Kyoto discussions, global pressure from other major nations  through the G-20 could lead these countries to lower their emissions.   Progress through the G-20 could help us reach the tipping point for global change.   But despite the fact that India, China and the United States are here this weekend—  along with Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan,  Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, and the United  Kingdom — climate change isn’t on the agenda for the G-20.   Energy security is on the G-20’s agenda, and I’m pleased that they’re talking about it.   But energy security can’t be separated from climate change.   Despite many worthy endeavours, the G-20 as an institution needs to carve out its  own global policy niche.   As the British environment secretary David Miliband said this week, climate change is  the defining global issue and requires global co-operation.   To my mind, climate change provides the G-20 with opportunity for moral leadership.   The G-20 represents about 85 per cent of global GDP and about two-thirds of the  global population.   It should not pass up the chance to press home the importance of a global response  to climate change with those countries whose contribution is key.    

 CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES WILL AID GROWTH    

 Last month I travelled to London to meet with Chancellor Gordon Brown and Stephen  Timms and Sir Nicholas Stern, author of the Stern report on the economics of climate  change.  

 In my meeting with Sir Nicholas he underscored how the long term economic cost of  not acting on climate change is far worse than the short term cost of taking steps to  lower our carbon emissions.   But crucially, he pointed out that going carbon clean is the growth strategy.   In fact with the right policies and incentives, Australian industries and consumers  could actually benefit from addressing climate change.   I absolutely repudiate the suggestion that carbon trading will harm the  competitiveness of our great commodity industries.   As the Stern report notes, fossil fuels will continue to play an important role.  

 

 In fact, emissions trading will spur new development in clean coal and carbon  capture and storage.   As the Australian Business Roundtable on Climate Change has recognised, Australian  businesses and consumers will benefit from early action.   That’s why the Roundtable has called for a national market based carbon pricing  mechanism to deliver cost-effective emission reductions.   And they’ve called for decisive action to give Australian companies the certainty they  need to make investment decisions.   They understand that acting now will give them access to new markets and new  opportunities.   While I was in London I also met with representatives of the Carbon Trust, a private  company set up with government backing to accelerate Britain’s transition to a low-carbon economy.   The Carbon Trust works with businesses to find ways to save money by investing in  low carbon technology, and it offers interest-free loans to SMEs to help them  implement low-carbon strategies.   It also matches highly innovative new technologies with venture capital to get them  off the ground.   Organisations like the Carbon Trust are crucial to helping businesses and  communities find ways to embrace a carbon-clean growth strategy.   But climate change demands international collective action, and international co-operation must cover all aspects of policies to reduce emissions — and that means  carbon pricing as well as low emission technology.   The next speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, has  identified climate change as one of her top legislative priorities.   She supports the Kyoto protocol and emissions trading.   She knows that when it comes to international agreements on climate change, Kyoto  is very important.   Australia must ratify the Kyoto protocol, substantially increase support for renewable  energy and other low carbon technologies, cut carbon emissions by 60 per cent by  2050 and establish a national emissions trading scheme to drive investment in clean  energy technology.    

 WE MUST DIRECTLY ADDRESS GLOBAL POVERTY    

 None of this means that we should avoid directly addressing global poverty. Labor is  unequivocally committed to working with developing countries to realise the  Millennium Development Goals.  

 Aid policy must be directed to encouraging sustainable economic growth that  benefits the poor; promoting good leadership, strong civil societies and effective  states; promoting security; and contributing to effective responses.   Labor is unequivocally committed to working with developing countries to realise the  Millennium Development Goals.

 

 Aid policy must be directed to encouraging sustainable economic growth that  benefits the poor; promoting good leadership, strong civil societies and effective  states; promoting security; and contributing to effective responses to humanitarian  crises.   But meeting the Millennium Development Goals must be the top priority of our aid  program.  Labor welcomed the Government’s announcement last year that it intends  to increase Australia’s development assistance budget to 0.36 per cent of Australia’s  gross national income in 2010.  But in 2010, that would make Australia 19th out of  the 22 OECD donors.   Labor believes the Government should commit to increasing Australia’s development  assistance budget to 0.5 per cent of gross national income as quickly as fiscal  circumstances permit, so that Australia can do its fair share to end extreme global  poverty.   

 EDUCATION AND HEALTH ARE KEY    

 One promise of the Millennium Development Goals is that every child in the world will  have a place in school.   That means creating 200 million places just to ensure that all our children have the  chance to reach their potential.   Achieving universal primary education is one of the keys to our global future, and one  of the most important investments we could ever make.   And we must also ensure that the world’s children can grow up healthy and strong.   That means seriously investing in effective programs to build health systems and  save lives through immunisation.   I am particularly struck by the work of GAVI — the global alliance on immunization —  who have worked with European governments to issue bonds to fund the ‘front-loading’ of immunization programs to save lives sooner.   They’re showing how innovative financing can play a crucial role in delivering funds  for development.   We must continue to work to eliminate HIV/AIDS, particularly in our region.   Only with good health and the chance of an education for every child will we see true  human flourishing in the developing world.    

 GLOBALISATION IS CRUCIAL FOR LOCKING IN DEVELOPMENT    

 But lifting aid levels and addressing climate change won’t by themselves address  global poverty.   The only sure way to bring prosperity to developing countries is to put in place the  conditions for economic growth and job creation in the long term.  The G-20 is well  placed to pursue those goals, and its 2005 Accord for Sustained Growth is a fine  model.   As Kofi Annan has said: “Personally, I do not believe that those people are victims of  globalisation. Their problem is not that they are included in the global market but, in  most cases, that they are excluded from it.”  

 

 

 Globalisation, growth and poverty reduction go together.   But as well as lifting our aid commitment and encouraging global growth, we need to  seize this opportunity to make the G-20 a coalition of the willing for action on climate  change.    

 Time is of the essence.
