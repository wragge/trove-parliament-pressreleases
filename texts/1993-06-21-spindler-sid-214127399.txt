 SENATOR SID Sf’INDLkR  AUSTRAI IAN DEMOCRAT  SENATOR FOR VICTORIA 

 MEDIA RELEASE

 PARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIA â   THE SENATE 

 21 June 1993 93/2672

 Admit More Refugees : Democrats

 The Federal Government should Increase the refugee component within Australia's  migration intake and implement comprehensive reforms to the refugee determination  process according to the Australian Democrats.

 Commenting at the start of Refugee Week, Victorian Senator and Democrat  Spokesperson for Ethnic Affairs Sid Spindler hit out at the Federal Government's tiny  refugee intake as an indictment on Australia's international human rights record.

 "With over 19 million refugees around the world, 3 million of whom are in camps in  Central and South East Asia Australia's intake of only 12,000 refugees is a highly  inadequate contribution to the problems which our region faces.

 "The detention of asylum seekers from Cambodia and Vietnam in Australian detention  centres for periods of up to four years is a human rights scandal.

 "The formal complaint against detention which is currently being lodged with the  United Nation's Human Rights Committee is a move which the Democrats fully  support.

 "The issue of detention Is clearly one which must be addressed in an International  setting because the Federal Government has exhibited nothing but contempt for those  Involved. *

 "The forced detention of boat people together with the Government's regressive  changes to appeal mechanisms, Interference in court proceedings, and cuts to  refugee and migrant services, represent the most serious of human rights  infringements. "

 "Increasing our refugee Intake to 20,000, reforming the refugee determination process,  releasing all asylum seekers currently held In custody and promoting human rights,  and the alleviation of poverty in the countries from which refugees come are the vital 

 steps which are now necessary.

 "Refugee W eek also provides us with the opportunity to recognise the contribution of  welfare agencies, churches, and specialist refugee agencies like Austcare In assisting  refugees and keeping the human rights Issues Involved before the eyes of the  community," concluded Senator Spindler.
