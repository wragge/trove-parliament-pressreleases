 Senator Kerry Nettle  Senator for New South Wales 

 Greens educate puzzled Minister who confuses  West Papua with Papua New Guinea.   

 Senator Nettle, 7th February 2006  In response to Senator Coonan's blunder during question time today where she confused  West Papua with Papua New Guinea, Senator Nettle has sent an appropriately named  information sheet: "Stop being Ignorant about West Papua", to Senator Coonan's  Ministerial office.    

 "If Senator Coonan's answer to my question about genocide in West Papua is the height  of government knowledge, we should all be very disappointed. Surely a Minister should  be able to point to West Papua on the map." Senator Nettle said.    

 "Two recent reports, one by Sydney University Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies  entitled "Genocide in West Papua?", and another by Yale University Law School,  document the systemic destruction of West Papuan people and society, yet the Australian  Government does not even seem to be aware of the crisis on our doorstep.    

 "In the last fortnight the special adviser to the U.N. Secretary-General on the Prevention  of Genocide, Juan Mendez commented that the Indigenous people of West Papua were at  risk of extinction but still the Government continues to train the Indonesian military.    

 "The Australian Government's policy of quiet indifference to human rights abuses in  West Papua has been made worse by a Minister who seems to not even know where West  Papua is," Senator Nettle said.
