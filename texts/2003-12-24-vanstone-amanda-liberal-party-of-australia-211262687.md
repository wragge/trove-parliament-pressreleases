 Senator Amanda Vanstone  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 

 UNHCR Review of Afghan Asylum Seekers

 VPS 018/2003

 I am aware that the UNHCR Regional office in Canberra has announced today that it intends to review the cases of many of  the 22 Afghan asylum seekers in Nauru it previously found not to be refugees

 Their decision to review these cases is based on recent changes to the situation in some regions of Afghanistan

 UNHCR has stressed that their decision is not related to the actions of those people on Nauru participating in the hunger strike 

 Australia always takes seriously information provided by UNHCR which might have a bearing on whether particular  individuals are in need of protection

 I understand that a consolidated assessment is likely to be available from UNHCR in the near future which will give more  information on the areas of concern

 As soon as consolidated information is received from UNHCR on those areas of Afghanistan where it believes the situation  has changed, the Government will examine the implications for those cases on Nauru previously assessed by DIMIA

 In the meantime, I call upon the hunger strikers to resume taking food as continuing their protest will not affect consideration  of their future status
