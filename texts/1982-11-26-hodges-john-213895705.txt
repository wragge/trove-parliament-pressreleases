 OPENING OF THE NEW KITCHEN DINING COMPLEX, WACOL MIGRANT 

 CENTRE, 10.00 A.M. FRIDAY, 26 NOVEMBER, 1982, BY THE HON.

 J.C. HODGES, M.P., MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION & ETHNIC AFFAIRS. .

 I AM DELIGHTED TO BE HERE TODAY TO OFFICIALLY OPEN THIS NEW 

 DINING ROOM AND KITCHEN COMPLEX OF THE WACOL' MIGRANT CENTRE.

 THIS COMPLEX HAS BEEN BUILT AT A COST OF $1.5 MILLION AND HAS 

 A CAPACITY TO CATER FOR UP TO 500 PEOPLE.

 IT REPRESENTS ANOTHER IMPORTANT STEP IN THE HISTORY OF THE 

 WACOL CENTRE WHICH HAS BEEN USED AS A MIGRANT CENTRE SINCE THE 

 EARLY 1950'S. SINCE THAT TIME OVER 20,000 PEOPLE HAVE STAYED 

 HERE. .

 HOWEVER, THE.OPENING OF THIS NEW CENTRE SHOULD NOT BE SEEN AS 

 JUST THE OPENING OF ANOTHER NEW BUILDING. THE WACOL CENTRE 

 HAS BEEN A HOME TO MANY MIGRANT FAMILIES WHEN THEY FIRST 

 ARRIVE IN THIS COUNTRY. .  INDEED, IN MANY WAYS THE WACOL CENTRE 

 AND THE FACILITIES IT PROVIDES SYMBOLISES THE WAY WE HAVE 

 RESPONDED TO THE MANY CHALLENGES WHICH HAVE ARISEN AS THE 

 RESULT OF OUR IMMIGRATION POLICY.

 I AM SURE YOU ARE AWARE THAT SINCE WORLD WAR II AUSTRALIA 

 HAS ACCEPTED OVER 3 MILLION MIGRANTS.  THIS REPRESENTS SOME 

 20 PER CENT OF OUR POPULATION. .

 THAT INFLUX OF PEOPLE HAS BEEN UNRIVALLED IN ANY OTHER 

 COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ISRAEL.

 LET US BE FRANK. SUCH AN INFLUX OF PEOPLE HAS PRESENTED 

 THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY WITH CHALLENGES TO WHICH WE HAD 

 TO RESPOND. .

 CERTAINLY THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS BUT IN THE MAIN THE 

 AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY HAVE RESPONDED MAGNIFICENTLY TO THE 

 MIGRANTS WHO HAVE ENTERED OUR COUNTRY. ALL OF US WILL 

 AGREE THAT MIGRATION HAS NOT ONLY MADE US A RICHER COUNTRY 

 CULTURALLY AND BROKEN DOWN OLD BARRIERS AND RACIAL PREJUDICES 

 BUT ALSO IT HAS HELPED AUSTRALIA ECONOMICALLY BY THE NEW 

 SKILLS AND ENTHUSIASM WHICH MIGRANTS HAVE BROUGHT WITH 

 THEM FROM THEIR MANY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.

 IT IS UNFORTUNATE TODAY THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE TOO QUICK TO 

 KICK THE "MIGRANT CAN" IN BLAMING THEM FOR SOME OF OUR PRESENT 

 PROBLEMS. I HOPE THIS WILL BE SHORT LIVED AND WE DO NOT 

 ,  TURN OUR BACKS ON THE CONTRIBUTION,  AND THE SACRIFICES WHICH

 Ma n y m i g r a n t s  h a v e m a d e t o t h i s c o u n t r y .

 SINCE I BECAME MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS 

 SOME SIX MONTHS AGO, I HAVE .ATTEMPTED TO MEET AS MANY ETHNIC 

 GROUPS AS POSSIBLE. I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH THE LOYALTY 

 THEY HAVE FOR THIS. COUNTRY, AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO OVERCOME 

 MANY DIFFICULTIES WITH LANGUAGE, CULTURE, AND FAMILY. TIES. 

 BACK IN THEIR HOMELAND TO ALLOW THEM TO SETTLE IN AUSTRALIA 

 AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS PROSPERITY.

 I BELIEVE THAT MANY AUSTRALIANS DON'T REALLY APPRECIATE 

 WHAT IS INVOLVED IN EMIGRATING TO THIS COUNTRY. WHETHER 

 PEOPLE COME HERE VOLUNTARILY OR AS REFUGEES THEY FACE 

 GENUINE" PROBLEMS .

 I CALL ON ALL MAINSTREAM AUSTRALIANS WHETHER AUSTRALIAN 

 OR OVERSEAS BORN TO ASSIST IN THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATION OF 

 OUR MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES. ALL OF US FROM TIME TO TIME 

 MUST MAKE A CONSCIOUS EFFORT IN THIS REGARD TO ENSURE 

 THESE NEW PEOPLE HAVE A HAPPY SETTLEMENT PERIOD.

 THAT IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE WACOL CENTRE AND CENTRES 

 LIKE IT AROUND AUSTRALIA HAVE PROPER FACILITIES SO THAT NEW 

 ARRIVALS RECEIVE THE BEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY OF BECOMING 

 PART OF THIS NATION.

 ALTHOUGH I AM OPENING THIS NEW KITCHEN AND DINING COMPLEX 

 I AM SURE YOU AGREE THAT MIGRANTS REQUIRE MORE THAN JUST 

 GOOD FOOD TO HELP THEM IN WHAT IS OFTEN A STRANGE COUNTRY.

 THE WACOL CENTRE OFFERS A RANGE OF SERVICES TO ASSIST MIGRANTS 

 WITH THE SETTLEMENT PROCESS. MY DEPARTMENT HAS TWO SOCIAL 

 WORKERS AND A WELFARE OFFICER WHO USE WACOL AS A BASE FOR 

 THEIR WORK IN THE COMMUNITY.

 IN ADDITION WE HAVE A SERIES OF ORIENTATION ACTIVITIES 

 ESPECIALLY AIMED AT REFUGEES TO GIVE THEM INFORMATION ABOUT 

 JOBS;, TO ASSIST IN OBTAINING ACCOMMODATION AND TO GIVE THEM 

 SOME APPRECIATION OF WHAT AUSTRALIA IS LIKE.

 WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE QUEENSLAND EDUCATION DEPARTMENT 

 ENGLISH LANGUAGE COURSES ARE CONDUCTED ON AN EXTENSIVE BASIS.

 THE COMMONWEALTH DEPARTMENTS OF EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL 

 RELATIONS AND SOCIAL SECURITY VISIT THE CENTRE REGULARLY 

 TO PROVIDE INFORMATION REGARDING THEIR RESPECTIVE AREAS.

 I AM ALSO INFORMED THAT THE COMMONWEALTH ACCOMMODATION AND 

 CATERING SERVICE MAINTAINS A FULLTIME SETTLEMENT OFFICER AND 

 A CHILD AND BABY MINDING FACILITY.

 YOU CAN SEE IT IS A TEAM.  EFFORT.  AS I INDICATED EARLIER, 

 AUSTRALIA'S RESPONSE TO THE CHALLENGE OF IMMIGRATION RELIES 

 VERY MUCH ON THE COMMUNITY AND NOT JUST ON GOVERNMENT PROGRAMMES

 THIS KITCHEN AND DINING COMPLEX WILL GREATLY ENHANCE THE 

 ABILITY OF THE CENTRE TO OPERATE AS A GENUINE HOME FOR.PEOPLE 

 WHO HAVE JUST ARRIVED.  THE KITCHEN IS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING 

 SOME 2,500 MEALS A DAY AND ADDITIONALLY WILL SUPPLY MEALS TO 

 TWO LOCAL MEALS-ON-WHEELS ORGANISATIONS.

 THIS NEW FACILITY REFLECTS THE GROWING NUMBER OF MIGRANTS 

 WHO ARE CHOOSING QUEENSLAND AS THEIR FIRST DESTINATION POINT.

 I THINK WE ALL AGREE;THAT QUEENSLAND IS NO LONGER THE 

 CINDERELLA STATE, BUT IS BECOMING, WITH ITS ECONOMIC DEVELOP­

 MENT AND INDUSTRIALISATION, THE STATE VERY MUCH OF THE FUTURE.

 IN CONCLUSION, I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE THE PROJECT 

 MANAGER, MR. B. WOHLFAHRT, AND THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION 

 LEADER, MR. R.F.  MOORE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE BUILDERS, MESSRS. 

 F.C. UPTON AND SONS. I THINK IT IS ALSO APPROPRIATE THAT 

 THANKS GOES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT AND CONSTRUCTION 

 WHO WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROJECT. THANKS MUST ALSO 

 BE EXPRESSED TO THE STAFF OF THE KITCHEN WHO OVER THE YEARS 

 HAVE DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB IN PROVIDING HALF A MILLION MEALS 

 TO MIGRANTS UNDER SOME DIFFICULTY AS THE WORK CONDITIONS 

 WERE MUCH LESS FAVOURABLE THAN THOSE IN THESE NEW PREMISES.

 MAY I OFFICIALLY OPEN THIS KITCHEN AND DINING ROOM COMPLEX 

 IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE STAFF WILL CONTINUE TO PREPARE 

 GOOD WHOLESOME FOOD FOR THE RESIDENTS.
