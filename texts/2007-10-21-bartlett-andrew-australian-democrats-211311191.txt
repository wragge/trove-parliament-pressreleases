 Media Statement  Sunday 21st October 2007

 

 SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT  Queensland Democrat Senator  QUEENSLANDâ€™S ONLY INDEPENDENT VOICE IN THE SENATE 

 

 Strong political response needed to combat racism -  Bartlett  supports our African communities   

 Lending his support to Brisbane's African community at the Stand Together event today, Queensland  Democrat Senator Andrew Bartlett said that Pauline Hanson's strengthening position in the polls is a  wake up call to all Queenslanders that the politics of prejudice risks dividing our society.   

 "Recent attacks on members of our community of African origin make it more acceptable to engage in  racist behaviour, which inevitably leads to discord and social unrest," Senator Bartlett said.   

 "Singling out groups in the community for attack and blame might create great media opportunities  but it fosters ignorance and damages Australia.   

 "Political leaders and candidates have a responsibility not to divide our community, regardless of the  votes that might be won, as it causes long-term damage as well as personal hurt.   

 "Pauline Hanson's rise in the latest Morgan Senate poll coincides with the government's recent  attacks on African refugees, reinforcing Ms Hanson's previous public attacks and stereotyping.    

 "It is also a timely reminder for Queenslanders that her extremist views are a direct challenge not only  to my seat in the Senate, but to the common sense approach against racial discrimination and  prejudice which I have strongly promoted.   

 "Migration has been, and continues to be, enormously beneficial to our society.  This is at a great risk  of being lost if our politicians and other community leaders pander to prejudice and ignorance rather  than stand up against it.   

 "Our ethnic communities must be supported and encouraged, not alienated and further distanced  from other Australians.     

 The Coaltion and Labor must urgently show Queenslanders what they are going to do to support  migrants and refugees as they integrate so that we can be sure that ignorance, prejudice and  divisiveness don't win," Senator Bartlett concluded.
