 Youth network receives $1.2 million boost 

 November 12, 2012  

 The Minister for Multicultural Affairs, Senator Kate Lundy, today announced Australia’s  Multicultural Youth Advocacy Network (MYAN) would receive $1.2 million in funding over  the next three years to support young people from migrant and refugee backgrounds settle in  Australia. 

 The funds will be provided from the Australian Government’s settlement grants program to  strengthen MYAN’s advocacy role and to build a multicultural youth specialist approach in  each state and territory. 

 Speaking at the launch of a new partnership project among MYAN NSW, the Centre for  Multicultural Youth (CMY), GWS Giants and Settlement Services International, Senator  Lundy said the funding would help develop a national approach to youth settlement and  support young people from a migrant and refugee backgrounds in the greater western Sydney  area. 

 “Adolescence is a time of transition that can be highly challenging even under the most  regular of circumstances,” Senator Lundy said. 

 “A lack of early and adequate settlement support increases the risk that young people will  require future assistance to address issues such as homelessness, family breakdown, poor  health, crime, and drug and alcohol use. 

 “There is a recognised need for a whole-of-sector approach to the issues that affect young  people of diverse backgrounds.” 

 MYAN is a nationally recognised policy and advocacy body, overseen by the CMY that  represents migrant and newly arrived young people and provides advice to government with a  focus on supporting the development of multicultural youth sector networks at the state and  territory level. 

 “The funding I have announced today will strengthen support and opportunities for young  people and improve outcomes for multicultural youth across Australia,” Senator Lundy  added.
