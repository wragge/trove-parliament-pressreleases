 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 30 September 2002    MEDIA RELEASE                          02/475

 Pacific solution - the suffering continues The Australian Democrats have once again condemned the Government’s Pacific Solution as fundamentally inhuman and grossly irresponsible, following the midnight deportation of an asylum seeker to Nauru.

 Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said the deportation of a Hazari asylum seeker back to Nauru showed the inevitable ongoing cruelty, which the Government’s policy is causing.

 Senator Bartlett said, “The fact that no boats are arriving should not fool people into thinking that the suffering has halted.

 “As last night’s deportation showed, families are continuing to be torn apart and traumatised, and the uncertainty hanging over people’s futures continues to cause great distress.”

 Senator Bartlett was present at Brisbane’s Wesley Hospital last night attempting to ensure that the two brothers would be allowed at least one final farewell. The deportee’s brother waited in vain for many hours to see him only to be told he had left the hospital grounds under guard.

 Senator Bartlett continued, “This is yet another case when one family member has been accepted as a refugee in Australia while the other has been stuck on Nauru for months only to have his case rejected.

 “There is not a family in the world who would sanction a forced separation such as this. Everyone understands the need to say goodbye, especially when someone has been hospitalised with a life threatening illness.

 “The policy of deliberately isolating people in the middle of the Pacific is not only ridiculously expensive, it is multiplying the trauma of innocent people.

 “The Democrats are once again challenging Labor to use their conference next weekend to address refugee policy.

 “As an absolute bottom line, Labor must support the abolition of the horrendously inhumane and expensive Pacific Solution as soon as possible,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
