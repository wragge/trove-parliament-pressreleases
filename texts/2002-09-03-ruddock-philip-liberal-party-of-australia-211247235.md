 Introduction

 I am pleased to have the opportunity this afternoon to discuss the government's management of Australia's immigration and humanitarian programs and the factors that are putting pressure on these programs.

 I will focus on these policies and place them in a broader context. The issues surrounding unauthorised arrivals and asylum seekers should not be viewed in isolation, but rather in the context of the larger scheme of government policy that is integral to maintaining the integrity of Australia's managed migration program.

 One of the core values underpinning the Government's immigration policy is that the government must have the capacity to manage the movement of people across Australia's borders in an orderly and efficient manner. Without this capacity, the idea of a managed immigration program rapidly becomes meaningless.

 The government has taken practical steps to strengthen the integrity of Australia's migration program and to allow Australia to continue to provide protection to people who are at greatest risk.

 We have also initiated changes to Australia's immigration laws that:

 Enhance the protection of Australia's borders from unauthorised entry; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Contain abuse of judicial review processes by unsuccessful visa applicants. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Before discussing those changes, I will begin with some general comments about the government's policies for managing migration.

 Managing Migration

 As you would know Australia has a long tradition of immigration. Indeed, Australia has been built on settlement from other countries. In many ways this has determined the very nature of contemporary Australian society:

 Almost 1 in 4 Australians today were born overseas. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Around 40 per cent of Australians were either born overseas or have at least one parent who was born overseas. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» In recent years, people from around 185 different countries have made Australia their home. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Australia is one of only a few countries in the world that have operated a planned immigration program for over 50 years.

 In a radio interview recently, Professor John Salt, a Professor of Geography at University College, London, and a consultant on migration to the European Union, the Council of Europe, and the OECD, commented:

 "Australia has probably gone further than any other country in developing a comprehensive management policy which is transparent, which is highly organised, [and] which lays out clearly the rules and regulations under which migration will occur . . . [it] involves discussion amongst the various interested groups and has a research base to look at how successful [it is]." [Radio National breakfast program, 6 May 2002.]

 This financial year, the Australian migration program will be the largest and most highly skilled in over a decade, with a planning level set in the range of 100,000 to 110,000 places. Sound immigration policy must be underpinned by some essential core values.

 The first of these is that the approach to migrant selection must be strictly non-discriminatory as far as matters such as race, religion, colour or ethnicity are concerned.

 A second is that immigration policies must enable Australians with non-Australian partners or dependent children to be re-united in Australia with those partners or children, and those persons be able in time to become Australian citizens.

 A third core value is that the overall immigration intake must be demonstrably in the national economic interest. If this were not the case, Australia's standard of living would deteriorate, community support for immigration would rapidly diminish, and Australia's capacity to provide a humanitarian program would be reduced.

 A fourth core value is that Australia must contribute its fair share to the resettlement of those most in need - the principle of international burden-sharing. In re-settling refugees, the government devotes very considerable resources to ensuring that these people have the support they need to fully participate as members of the Australian community.

 And last, but by no means least, the government must have the capacity to manage the movement of people across Australia's borders in an orderly and efficient manner. As I stated earlier, without this critical capacity, a managed immigration policy rapidly becomes meaningless.

 It is the last three of these core values that I will be concentrating on this afternoon, as they have particular relevance to asylum seeker and unauthorised arrival issues.

 The government has introduced measures to enhance the migration program which have included adjustments to restore the Australian community's confidence in the program, by refocussing it to contribute to Australia's development and future prosperity; and other measures to meet changing situations challenging Australia's border integrity.

 All these measures contribute to Australia continuing to have the economic and social capacity to give practical effect to the nation's commitment to assist those at greatest risk.

 By mid 2002 the UNHCR stated that the number of 'people of concern' was approximately 19.7 million. The sheer magnitude of the problem means that governments must make hard choices, based on limited resources, as to the best way to most effectively assist those in greatest need.

 Australia's Humanitarian Program

 Since World War II, Australia has resettled 600,000 refugees. The government's humanitarian program currently provides, each year, around 12,000 refugees and others who are in humanitarian need with residence in Australia.

 Australia's humanitarian program is based on values contained in various international human rights treaties, but the government's commitment goes beyond those obligations under those treaties, particularly through the offshore humanitarian resettlement program. While our desire to assist these people is strong, Australia, like most countries has a finite capacity to give practical effect to this. The pressure placed on Australia's resources by those arriving in Australia without authority, and seeking to engage Australia's obligations to provide protection, limits the government's capacity to assist those at greatest risk.

 Australia's humanitarian program reflects the three durable solutions promoted by the UNHCR for the longer term protection needs of people displaced by humanitarian crises:

 Voluntary repatriation in conditions of safety and dignity is the most desirable outcome for the individual; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» If repatriation is not feasible, local integration in the country of first asylum ; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Where neither of these is possible or suitable, resettlement in a third country may be an option - although it is often described as the durable solution of last resort and is the preferred option for a relatively small number of people. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Australia is one of the few countries that have such a program. This program is one of the chief means by which Australia assists the international protection system. Under this program Australia resettles those persons in the very greatest need - those who are at risk if they remain where they are and who have no other means of escape other than resettlement in a third country.

 Offshore humanitarian entrants to Australia have access to some of the most comprehensive and generous services in the world to assist them to become fully participating members of the Australian community. The assistance provided is tailored to the individual's needs, in recognition of the fact that refugees are particularly vulnerable.

 Each 1000 refugees resettled under these schemes costs more than $AUS 30 million to the Australian budget.

 Australia's Immigration Programs under Threat

 The migration and humanitarian programs have been jeopardised by people seeking asylum in Australia, particularly those arriving by irregular means. Unauthorised arrivals have caused humanitarian program places to be diverted away from people who have been identified by the UNHCR as being in need of resettlement. Many of these people have been living in appalling conditions in refugee camps for many years. (For example, see images from the Kakuma refugee camp in Northern Kenya.)

 The fact is that the numbers of unauthorised arrivals increased very rapidly over the last four years, and approximately 80 per cent of boat arrivals have arrived without identity documentation.

 Four years ago we had around 157 boat arrivals, three years ago 920, and in the last two years over 4000. With the very large number of people that we were advised were in Indonesia at that time in the pipeline intent on travelling to Australia, it would not be unreasonable to assume that, if we had not acted, we were looking at potentially 12,000 unauthorised arrivals.

 What are the implications of that? Well, if we were really dealing in every case, with persons who were refugees and who had an urgent need of a resettlement outcome, one perhaps would not worry.

 But when you have people smugglers choosing for you, some people who will be refugees, some people who may not, you have a situation where even if some people obtain refugee status in Australia, these people may not be the most vulnerable and in need of resettlement in Australia.

 You also have a situation where you allow people smugglers to continue to endanger and exploit the lives of ordinary people, whilst at the same time threatening the government's ability to manage its migration and humanitarian programs.

 The September 2001 Legislative Changes

 The government has attempted to address the threats to its immigration programs by progressively implementing a range of measures to combat people smuggling and stop abuse of Australia's refugee determination processes.

 The government has implemented a range of legislative initiatives including:

 The introduction of specific people smuggling offences with penalties of up to 20 years imprisonment. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» The introduction of a privative clause to limit abuse of the judicial review process. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» 28 and 35 day time limits on federal and high court applications respectively, and a limit on class actions. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Excision of certain places off the coast of Australia and the introduction of temporary protection visas for unauthorised arrivals who are

 found to be refugees. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 These changes were part of the government's multi-faceted approach to combat people smuggling, and were part of a broader package of reforms involving international aid and cooperation.

 Legislative Changes - Excision

 One of the clear messages of the legislation passed last September and since is that people who abandon or bypass effective protection opportunities and travel to Australia will not be granted a permanent visa to Australia. This recognised that in discharging its obligations under the refugees convention, Australia does not have to provide permanent residence and access to all of the resettlement services that are provided to offshore humanitarian entrants.

 One part of these changes was to bar persons who arrive without lawful authority at an excised offshore place from being able to apply for an Australian visa unless the minister exercises his discretionary power. These changes also provide the power to move people to third countries to have their claims assessed. The purpose behind these changes was to remove the ability for unauthorised arrivals who land on Australian offshore places from being able to access Australia's comprehensive visa application and review processes.

 Australia continues to meet its obligations under the refugees convention to these people by ensuring that refugee claims of asylum seekers are assessed. The arrangements the government has established in cooperation with the UNHCR (which has been generally referred to as "the Pacific Solution") provide access to processes for refugee status determination which match those of UNHCR.

 The legislation also introduced a new visa regime to deter people moving from or bypassing other safe countries where they could gain or seek effective protection. The new visa regime provides for a hierarchy of benefits depending upon whether the applicant has been involved in secondary movement, and where people made their application.

 Underlying the government's approach is the need to differentiate between those persons directly fleeing from countries in which they face persecution, and those who come to Australia via countries where they were safe. The refugees convention itself contemplates that difference in the reference to direct flight in Article 31. Failure to think clearly about the difference can lead to unsubstantiated criticism and plays into the people smugglers' hands.

 The government is managing its absolute commitment to refugee protection in ways that also combat people smuggling and deny migration outcomes to those making often life endangering secondary movements. The government is committed to preserving the integrity of orderly entry systems to Australia.

 Judicial Review Changes and the Privative Clause

 I turn now to mention some of the other legislative measures that were taken in September 2001 to address concerns about the increasing cost and incidence of migration litigation.

 One of these measures was the introduction of a 'privative clause' on immigration decisions. The concept of a 'privative clause' has a long legislative history and has been longstanding government policy. The original bill was introduced into the parliament in 1997. It has been the subject of two inquiries by the senate and legal and constitutional legislation committee in 1997 and 1999.

 Prior to the introduction of the 'privative clause', a previous judicial review regime had been implemented by the last Labor government in the early 1990s. This regime was part of a package of reforms that was intended to reduce federal court litigation and to provide greater certainty as to what was required from both decision-makers, and visa applicants and visa holders. These reforms included significant expansion of independent merits

 review, including the creation of the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT).

 That scheme did not reduce the volume of cases before the courts - in fact it was just the opposite. Recourse to the federal and high courts increased from nearly 400 applications in 1994-95 to 1,340 in 2000 - 2001.

 The corresponding costs of that litigation also continued to soar. In 1995-96, the cost of all litigation for my department was $AUS 5.8 million (and that does not include the cost of running the courts).

 in 1996-97 the cost was just over $AUS 6 million. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» in 1997-98 it was nearly $AUS 9.5 million. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» in 1998-99 it was nearly $AUS 11.5 million. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» in 1999-2000 it was nearly $AUS 12.3 million. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 And, in the 2000-2001 financial year, the costs to my department exceeded $AUS 15 million.

 This trend occurred despite full and open access by applicants to heavily subsidised independent merits review by the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal.

 Between one third to one half of applicants withdrew their applications prior to the court hearing. Of the cases that go on to substantive hearings, the merits based decision was upheld in around 90 per cent of cases. It is hard not to conclude that a substantial number of applicants used the legal process primarily in order to extend their stay in Australia. In the migration area, litigation can be an end in itself - it is probably the only area of administrative law where delaying the final determination is seen as beneficial by those pursuing court action.

 Faced with these problems, the government believes that access to judicial review in migration matters should be restricted in all but exceptional circumstances. This recognises the extensive merits review rights that are available in migration legislation, as well as is a response to concerns over the misuse of court processes by those who seek to delay their stay and frustrate their removal from Australia.

 In light of the Australian high court's original jurisdiction to consider challenges to the actions and decisions of commonwealth officers under section 75(v) of the Australian constitution, the government's legal advisers (six Queens Counsel) found that a 'privative clause' would be the only effective mechanism.

 A privative clause operates to give decision-makers wider lawful operation for their decisions and thereby reduces the grounds on which the courts can set aside such decisions as being unlawful.

 Under Australian High Court caselaw, namely the Hickman case (R v Hickman; Ex Parte Fox and Clinton (1945) 70 CLR 598) and subsequent authorities, the wording of the clause in the migration act has the effect of limiting the grounds for finding a decision to be unlawful to the following.

 The decision-maker was not acting in good faith in making the decision; or âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» The decision is not reasonably capable of reference to the decision-making power given to the decision-maker; or âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» The decision does not relate to the subject matter of the legislation; or âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» The decision exceeded the limits in the commonwealth constitution. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 These limited grounds are intended to facilitate faster resolution of court cases, thereby decreasing delays in removal of non-citizens and lowering costs.

 The new judicial review scheme for immigration matters was designed on the basis of longstanding high court statutory interpretation of privative clauses in other areas of law. While that is so, we expected that some litigants would choose to contest the validity of the privative clause in the migration act.

 Since the introduction of the privative clause on 2 October 2001 until 30 June 2002, some 1326 migration matters have been resolved in the courts.

 Out of these 1326 cases, 519 cases or 39.1 per cent of cases related to decisions subject to the privative clause. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» The overall success rate for matters subject to the privative clause over this period was 95.4 per cent. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 A trend which can be seen in most privative clause cases which have been determined is that the court has conducted an examination of whether the decision under review contains any legal error (as understood generally), and then, if necessary, has gone on to determine what the effect of the privative clause is in the particular circumstances of the case under review.

 In a very large number of the cases determined the courts have not found any general legal error, and therefore have not had to consider the impact of the privative clause.

 On 15 August 2002, a five-member bench of the full Federal Court handed down its decisions in five cases heard together on 3-4 June 2002 regarding the operation of the privative clause.

 The court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the privative clause and held that the privative clause has limited the court's ability to set aside migration decisions as invalid.

 The full court did, however, set aside decisions in two matters as the decisions in these cases did not comply with express statutory requirements that went to the decision-maker's jurisdiction. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Today the High Court is hearing two cases concerning the privative clause. The High Court's decision will be awaited with interest.

 Asylum Seekers - Detention and International Obligations

 I would now like to comment on the policy of mandatory detention as this has received considerable media attention in recent times.

 First I would like to point out that people are detained because they arrived, or have remained, in Australia without authority - not because they are asylum seekers. Not all unauthorised arrivals are asylum seekers; and not all asylum seekers are unauthorised arrivals. In the 2001 calendar year, 36 per cent of asylum seekers arrived in Australia without authority. The majority of asylum seekers have entered Australia with a valid visa and are free in the community while their claims are assessed.

 The next point I would like to make is that the majority of asylum seekers currently in detention are not awaiting a primary decision. In fact:

 of the 179 detainees at woomera as at 9 August this year, only two were waiting for a primary decision, and this was because of outstanding character and security issues; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 94 have had the application process finalised and were available for removal; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» 74 were before the courts; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» two were waiting for a grant after being remitted to the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) for review; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» 7 were before the RRT. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Immigration detention ensures that people who have arrived unlawfully do not enter the Australian community until their claims to do so have been properly assessed against internationally agreed standards. It also ensures that those who are refused visas to remain in Australia are available for removal.

 Every effort is taken to treat detainees as humanely and with as much respect for their human dignity as possible. These present challenges because of the diverse age, family composition, nationality, cultural and religious backgrounds of the detainees.

 There is an apparent misconception held by a significant number of people that the refugees convention creates a right to claim asylum from persecution per se. This is not the case. Australia owes protection obligations under the refugees convention in cases where there is a well-founded fear of persecution for one of the five reasons stated in the refugees convention. Australia has no protection obligations under this convention unless this test is met.

 The refugees convention is not a universal solution to all cases where compassion or public interest may suggest that a person be allowed to remain in Australia. Domestic laws provide for other mechanisms, such as the minister's non-compellable public interest intervention powers that may be used to address such cases.

 Conclusion

 One of the important messages I hope I have conveyed to you this afternoon is that the Australian government remains committed to meeting its obligations under international law and continuing to provide protection to people most at risk.

 The recent changes to Australia's immigration laws that I have been talking about demonstrate that commitment. The current process has been adopted by parliament as representing the optimal balance between administrative justice, public accountability and lawful and efficient administration.

 These new measures that have been put in place will ensure the efficacy of Australia's planned immigration and offshore humanitarian resettlement programs. By enhancing the protection of Australia's borders from unauthorised entry and preventing abuse of our judicial review processes, the new measures improve Australia's ability to assist those at greatest risk.

 These are challenges that individual countries cannot tackle effectively on their own - they require the UNHCR and the international community to work together.

 I cannot stress enough the Australian government's commitment to continue to work with other like-minded states and organisations to reduce the activities of people smugglers and address the fundamental factors driving people to use their services.
