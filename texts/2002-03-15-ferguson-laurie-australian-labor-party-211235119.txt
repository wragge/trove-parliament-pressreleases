 15 March 2002 HARDGRAVE  MISLEADS ON LANGUAGE HELP FOR MIGRANTS

 ‘Government claims that migrants in Australia have a better understanding of English than their British counterparts appear extremely dubious,’ the Shadow Minister for Multicultural Affairs, Laurie Ferguson MP said today.

 ‘In Question time on Wednesday Minister Hardgrave said he was astonished that more than one million people in Britain do not have a good understanding of the English language. He strongly suggested that Australia’s system of settlement services for migrants would not have allowed such a situation to occur.

 ‘It is notable that the Minister provided no directly comparable data on the English language ability of the 2 countries. In fact, the data seems to suggest that the situation is not as rosy as the Minister implied.

 ‘Official data shows that at the 1996 Census more than 400,000 Australians over the age of 5 did not speak English well or at all. That is 2.3% of the population. The comparable proportion in the UK, according to Minister Hardgrave’s answer, appears to be better than this at 1.7%.

 ‘Strangely, Minister Hardgrave also failed to point out that the Coalition has removed access to the Adult Migrant Education Program (AMEP) by a growing number of refugee arrivals. Close to 7,000 temporary protection visa (TPV) holders, who have arrived since October 1999, are expected to work but have no access to formal English tuition. As migrant service agencies constantly remind me, the number of TPV holders is growing weekly.

 ‘It is bizarre in the extreme for Minister Hardgrave to congratulate himself on the number of AMEP clients when it is deliberate Coalition policy to reduce this client pool as part of the TPV arrangements that they introduced,’ Mr Ferguson concluded.
