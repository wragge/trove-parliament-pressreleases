 THE HON SHAYNE NEUMANN MP 

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR   

 APPOINTMENT AS SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION    

 I am honoured to be appointed as Shadow Minister for Immigration and Border  Protection by the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon Bill Shorten MP.   

 It is a great privilege to once again serve in Bill Shorten’s Cabinet.    

 I acknowledge the outstanding contribution of my predecessor, the Hon Richard Marles,  and I look forward to facilitating respectful discussion on the important issues of  immigration and border protection.   

 The security of our nation must be front and centre in terms of our priorities and I look  forward to working with the men and women who serve to protect Australia’s borders.   

 Migration has helped to shape modern, vibrant and inclusive Australian communities.    

 We owe a lot of the prosperity that our nation has enjoyed to those people who have  chosen to call Australia home and who contribute to the multicultural fabric of our  nation.   

 Over the next three years Labor will continue to adopt a compassionate approach to  asylum seekers that ensures the safety and security of all Australians.
