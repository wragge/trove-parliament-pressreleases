 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship    Media Release 

 

 Kevin Rudd's failed border protection policies compromise integrity of our  immigration programme 

 Friday 16th April 2010 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said Minister Evans must 

 immediately confirm what instructions have been given to his department officials who, 

 according to reports today, were told to ‘back off on all non essential visa checking’. 

 

 “Kevin Rudd’s immigration and border protection policy failures, which have resulted in 110 

 illegal boat arrivals, are threatening the integrity of our immigration system. Christmas Island 

 is already in chaos and now the department and our broader immigration programmes are 

 being thrown into gridlock,” Mr Morrison said. 

 

 “This will mean further delays on visa applications for people seeking to come through the 

 front door, increased risks on checks undertaken on those seeking to come and 

 compromising the department’s ability to crack down on visa breaches, rorts and frauds,” he 

 said. 

 

 “These breaches, rorts and frauds potentially range from human trafficking for sex slavery to 

 illegal workers in sweat shops. 

 

 “Already ASIO have raised concerns about their resources being under stress due to the 

 need to deal with the surge in asylum seekers from illegal boat arrivals. 

 

 “Now it is reported Immigration Department officials on the mainland are being asked to soft 

 pedal on visa breaches. 

 

 “Minister Evans must confirm today what instructions have been given to officials and what 

 impact the chaos created by Kevin Rudd’s failed border protection and immigration polices 

 for asylum seekers is having on the integrity of our entire immigration programme. 

 

 “Kevin Rudd’s decision last Friday to put in an election fix on illegal boat arrivals will only 

 place further strain on the system, without solving the problem. The policy will see detention 

 centres around the country fill up and remove our capacity to deal with the broader 

 challenges of protecting the integrity of our immigration system on shore. 

 

 “Strong border protection policies are the best friend of a strong and effective immigration 

 programme. It is the necessary prerequisite for community confidence in our immigration 

 programme that has been undermined by Kevin Rudd’s failed policies and decisions,” Mr 

 Morrison said.
