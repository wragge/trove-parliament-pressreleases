 Prime Minister gives insight into a key to his success - cover up  one lie with an even bigger one

 Democrats' Deputy Leader, Andrew Bartlett, has reacted with disbelief to the Prime Minister's dishonest claim  that the refugees from the infamous 'children overboard' incident "sank their boat."

 "The Prime Minister has sunk to new depths with this latest dishonest slander," Senator Bartlett said.

 "It can only be seen as an effort to divert attention from his culpability in the children overboard deception and  the responsibility his government bears for placing the children's lives at serious risk."

 "The Prime Minister is perhaps the most successful politician of his generation, and his latest disgraceful  statements give some indication why. He is clearly more willing than any other politician to lie, and if he is  caught out in that lie, he tries to cover it up by telling an even bigger one." 

 "Never admit the lie, never apologise to those who were slandered, just widen the slur even further, while  refusing to let yourself become aware of any evidence that contradicts your statements."

 Senator Bartlett, who was a key member of the Senate Inquiry which examined the children overboard  incident in great detail, said the facts are beyond dispute about why the 'children overboard' boat (named  SIEV 4 by government agencies at the time) ended up sinking.

 "It was the government's refusal to allow the refugees to be rescued from the unseaworthy boat, instead  directing that the Navy put it under tow, which caused the boat to eventually break up and sink, putting the  refugees including the children in the water."

 "The Commander of the HMAS Adelaide, the Navy vessel which intercepted the boat, informed the Prime  Minister's taskforce right from the start that the refugee's boat was seriously overcrowded and unseaworthy.  Despite this fact, the PM's taskforce refused to allow the Navy to rescue the refugees from the unsafe boat,  instead directing them to tow the boat around until an alternative could be found."

 "It was the impact of towing this unseaworthy vessel for twenty-four hours which contributed to it breaking up  and sink. Only once the boat was actually sinking and the refugees were ending up in the water were they  allowed to rescue them."

 "It is an amazing tribute to the skill of the crew of the HMAS Adelaide and something close to a miracle - that  they managed to rescue every one of the refugees from drowning," concluded Senator Bartlett.
