 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 Scott Morrison 

 More boats and more blow outs arriving for taxpayers 

 21/06/12  

 The arrival of the third illegal boat in 24 hours, with 117 people on board, means  more than 2,000 people on 29 illegal boats have arrived in the last six weeks since  the budget, blowing another hole in Laborâs shaky budget, Shadow Minister for  Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice,  Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 “When Labor delivered its mythical surplus budget it estimated that 450 people  would arrive on illegal boats each month. People have been arriving on illegal boats  at more than three times this rate since, with illegal boats turning up more than every  other day, blowing more holes in Laborâs failed budget and meaning more pain for  taxpayers,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “This is a government whose budget has blown out because our borders have blown  out under their failed policies. This governmentâs budget is crumbling before their  eyes just six weeks after it was handed down,” he said. 

 “Labor have given up on border protection and given in to the Greens and people  smugglers, so the least they can do is be up front with the Australian people about  how much their failures are going to cost them in further budget blowouts.  

 “The farce over Captain Emad, followed by the confirmation that we now have a  âCaptain Ewazâ at Inverbrackie Detention Centre and combined with an accelerated  rate of arrivals, shows this government should admit they got it wrong when they  abolished the proven policies of the Howard Government and that they are a pull  factor in their own right for illegal boats. 

 “I have no confidence Labor will do anything to end this farce, other than offer more  excuses, blame others for their own failings and do nothing. 

 “Any policy this government wants to produce will fail because it will be outweighed  by the enormous pull factor of the government itself,” Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr Keenan said: “This latest boat has seen 238 people arrive illegally in Australia  over the last 24 hours - reinforcing that June is set to be the biggest boat arrival  month for both boats and people under this Labor Government. 

 “The logistical challenges associated with dealing with this huge influx of people will  see Border Protection Command pushed to breaking point. 

 “Our patrol boats are virtually cracking up under the strain of this operation tempo as  revealed in estimates and there are enormous question marks over the ability of  BPC to keep a suitable number of them at sea. 

 “Boats are being manned by reservists as our forces struggle to cope with the  demands placed on them because of Laborâs failures. 

 “More of the same brings great dangers for our forces and for the illegal arrivals. 

 “If the boats keep arriving at this rate it will not be possible for BPC to continue to do  their job with the diminishing resources at their disposal. 

 “Labor created this problem and they cannot just accept what is currently going on  now as the status quo,” Mr Keenan said.
