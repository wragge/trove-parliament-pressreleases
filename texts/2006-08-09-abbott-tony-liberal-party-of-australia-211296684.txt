 TRANSCRIPT  Minister for Health and Ageing  Leader of the House of Representatives 

 Tony Abbott MHR 

 

 DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA  WEDNESDAY, 9 AUGUST 2006   

 REPORTER   

 Given the current debate over the migration changes, Minister, doesn't the work of  this group stand at odds with the way we turn people away, who then end up dead or  tortured again?   

 ABBOTT   

 Not at all. Australia has a very good record in helping the dispossessed. We have a  better record than just about any other country on Earth when it comes to helping  refugees. We think that people should come to this country in an authorised fashion,  but once they are here, appropriately and legitimately, we've got to give them the best  possible services and that's what we have traditionally given them through  organisations like the Forum, and this is what we are determined to continue to give  them, and that's why the Government has provided an additional one-off grant of   $2 million to the Forum, to ensure that highly traumatised new residents of our  country can fully integrate into the mainstream of Australia and become first-class  Australians as quickly as possible.   

 REPORTER     

 Do you think the average Australian has any idea of the experiences that some of the  people that they walk around with have been through?   

 ABBOTT   

 Absolutely right. I mean, it's almost inconceivable to average Australians what some  of the people who come to our country from these war-torn parts of the world have  been through and Goy was reticent about his own personal experiences, but just in the  few minutes that I was talking to him before coming up here, it became pretty obvious  that this is a young man who has seen far more of the ugly side of life than any human  being should ever see; and while, in the end, it is the innate resilience of people's  humanity which gets them through, it helps to have the kind of services which the  Forum provides. 

 

 REPORTER   

 Just on another issue, I think, even as we speak, Julia Gillard's giving a press  conference, where she's complaining about the effect of the Free Trade Agreement  with the US on blood providers and she says that it shouldn't be . . . US operators  shouldn't be allowed in. What do you think of that position? 

 

 ABBOTT   

 Well, the blood service is run on an inter-governmental basis. Nothing can happen to  the blood service without agreement between the Commonwealth and the states and,  if Julia is serious about this, and if the ALP is serious about this, well, it won't happen,  because the Labor states won't agree to it.     

 I have to say that, speaking as the Commonwealth Health Minister, I think that our  current blood arrangements are fundamentally sound. We're reviewing them at the  moment, as we are required to do under the Free Trade Agreement, but no one should  assume because we are reviewing them, that there will be any significant change.   Certainly, our policy of voluntary blood donations will continue and, certainly, our  policy to be self-sufficient, as far as is possible, in blood supplies, will continue.   

 

 The only question is, should CSL’s effective monopoly change, and let’s see what the  review tells us. But nothing can change without the agreement of the state Labor  Governments. 

 

 REPORTER   

 Can you give a guarantee that it will remain self-sufficient?   

 ABBOTT   

 I can give a guarantee that that will remain our policy.  But at the moment, we are not  wholly self-sufficient because there aren't enough donations.  Now, the blood service  is doing its best to ensure that the supply of blood goes up rather than down. But  certainly, I can give a guarantee that the policy of self-sufficiency will continue.   

 REPORTER   

 From what you know, do you think Australia's . . . the safety of Australia's blood  products and the methods that are used to create them in Australia, is safer than those  in other parts of the world?   

 ABBOTT   

 Look, I'm not really in a position to make a comment on how other countries run their  blood supply or their blood services, but I have no reason to think that ours isn’t at  least as safe as anyone else’s. As far as I'm aware, we are running our blood supply in  accordance with the best possible - the highest possible - standards.   

 REPORTER   

 Labor says it's considering the idea of step-down facilities to get frail aged out of  public hospitals. What do you think of that plan?   

 ABBOTT   

 Well, I think that Labor's playing catch-up politics. I’m surprised that someone who is  normally as diligent as Julia in keeping tabs on government policy hasn't figured out  that we've been doing this for some years now.   

 REPORTER   

 Can you explain how you've been doing it?   

 ABBOTT   

 Well, in the ‘04 and the ‘05 Budgets, we made quite large provision for the funding of  step-down places and the provision of step-down facilities. From memory, we have  provided, in conjunction with the states, about 2,000 step-down places, because when  we went to the states and asked them, at any one time, roughly how many people are  there in acute public hospitals who would be better off in different types of facilities,  they told us that that was the number and that’s why we’re providing that number of  places.   

 REPORTER   

 They say that there’s still . . . this is still a problem. Is that at odds with your advice  and, if it’s true, what would you do about it?   

 ABBOTT   

 There are always going to be a small number of people who are in transition between  an acute hospital and some other facility because it inevitably takes somewhere  between a few hours and a few days, even in the best possible system, to arrange for 

 new accommodation after someone has been assessed as suitable for accommodation  and is no longer so sick that the person requires acute hospital treatment. So there are  always going to be a small number of people in transition. What we have to avoid, as  far as we can, is people who really no longer need acute hospital treatment spending  long periods of time in hospital beds that could readily be used by others.     

 The question for Julia is, if she believes, as she said in today’s paper, that the  Commonwealth is engaging in the mother of all cost shifts to the states - how much  extra Commonwealth money does she think should be made available to fund these  extra services that she thinks are warranted, and where is any future Labor  government going to get that money? What other services does Julia think should be  curtailed so that these extra services, that she thinks the Commonwealth should fund,  can be provided? 

 

 REPORTER   

 Senator Brown’s moving an amendment in the Senate today that seeks to ban junk  food advertising during children's viewing hours. Would you support that?   

 ABBOTT   

 No. I certainly support responsible advertising of food during children’s viewing  hours but, in the end, I think that the best way forward here is to try to raise awareness  of just what the food we're putting in our mouth is doing to us, rather than running  around banning things; and certainly the approach that the Australian Government is  pursuing in this area seems to be fully in accordance with the approach that the UK  Labour Prime Minister has adopted. He thinks that we can very easily get into a nanny  state situation here. He doesn't think it's right in Britain and I don't think it's right in  Australia. I think as is often the case, Tony Blair is providing a very good model and  some very wise guidance to people in this country.
