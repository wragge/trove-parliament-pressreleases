 CAMBODIAN BOAT PEOPLE

 I have been briefed on the issues dealt with in the Federal  Court in Darwin this morning.

 For legal reasons, I am not in a position to comment in any  detail except to say that my Counsel will be putting the  Government's position to a hearing of the Court tomorrow.

 To reiterate the position I put yesterday: I have offered to have the decisions on the 37 Cambodians re-examined and made  again. In announcing this, I said that I -  had been made aware  of a defect in the process followed in the later stages of the  decision procedure,  and that this issue would be addressed in  the re-examination of that decision.

 In regard to the continuing detention of the boat people, the  Department consented to the continuation of the stay order by  the Federal Court pending final resolution of the matter.

 I would point out, however, that the issue of detaining people  who arrive on our shores without entry rights is an important  element of the Government's capacity to control our borders.

 I will also be discussing, in the course of the next few days,  with my colleague, the Attorney-General, the need for the  Government to explore the legislative possibilities to  strengthen the Government's capacity to respond to legal  challenges to the refugee determination process which I can  only describe as being a very fair and just procedure.
