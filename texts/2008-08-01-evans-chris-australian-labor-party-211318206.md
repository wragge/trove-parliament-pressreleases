 Senator Chris Evans  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 New tribunal members face merit-based selection 

 Friday 1 August 2008 

 The Rudd Government will undertake a transparent, merit-based selection process to recruit  five senior members for the independent refugee and migration review tribunals instead of just  re-appointing existing members.  

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, said advertisements had  been placed for suitably qualified people to hold full-time senior member positions on the  Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) and Migration Review Tribunal (MRT).  

 ‘To ensure a fully transparent process, I am choosing not to exercise my option to simply re-appoint current members, as has occurred in previous years,’ Senator Evans said. 

 ‘A fair and robust selection process is also in line with the new merit and transparency  guidelines on statutory office holders issued by the Australian Public Service Commission.’ 

 The tribunals provide independent and final merits review of decisions of the Department of  Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) with the MRT providing a review of general visa decisions  and the RRT a review of protection visa decisions.  

 â¢ The tribunals currently consist of 92 members comprising  13 full-time members and 79 part-time members, all of  whom are cross-appointed to both tribunals, with the  exception of the deputy principal member whose position  only exists within the RRT.  

 Senior members hear and determine individual cases, including more complex matters in  accordance with the Migration Act 1958 and the Migration Regulations 1994, ensuring their  decisions are of high quality and made within applicable time-frames.   

 ‘It is crucial to ensure these tribunals operate to their maximum potential and in an open and  accountable way,’ Senator Evans said.  

 ‘They have a very important role in maintaining an independent, fair and equitable system. We  are looking for applicants who possess a strong sense of fairness and an understanding of the  principles of administrative law and an ability to apply these in determining review  applications.’ 

 The positions will be available in Sydney and Melbourne and further information and selection  documentation can be obtained from the tribunals’ website.  See: www.mrt-rrt.gov.au 

 Current senior members of the MRT-RRT have been invited to participate in the upcoming  recruitment round.
