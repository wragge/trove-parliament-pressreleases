 SHADOW MINISTER FOR EMPLOYMENT AND WORKPLACE RELATIONS 

 Ten questions Julia Gillard must answer while visiting Tasmania 

 15/07/10  

 Julia Gillard cannot afford to ignore the concerns of Tasmanians during tomorrow’s  fly in - fly out visit. 

 1. Will the Prime Minister rule out using taxpayers’ money to buy-out Tasmanian  forest industry jobs?  

 2. Does the Prime Minister still support the Mark Latham forest policy, as she did in  2004?  

 3. Will the Prime Minister give a guarantee that no Tasmanian mining company will  be impacted by Labor’s proposed new mining tax?  

 4. Why did Ms Gillard short-change Tasmanian cancer patients by $30 million?  

 5. Where is the MRI machine for the North West coast that Sid Sidebottom promised?  

 6. What is Ms Gillard doing to fix the debacle over the GP Super Clinics that Labor  promised the Tasmanian people three years ago?  

 7. Has the Prime Minister driven on the Midland Highway?  

 8. Will she match the Coalition’s $400 million commitment to duplicate it?  

 9. Given that Ms Gillard’s predecessor Kevin Rudd said that while he was Prime  Minister union boss Kevin Harkins’ chances of becoming a Labor Senator would be  “Buckley’s and none”, would Ms Gillard now support a reinvigorated Kevin Harkins  Senate campaign?  

 10. If she does, then would she also support Mr Harkins’ plan for Tasmania to be used  as a regional processing centre for asylum seekers?
