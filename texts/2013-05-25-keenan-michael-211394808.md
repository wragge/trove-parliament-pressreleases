 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 3 BOATS AND OVER 200 PEOPLE ARRIVE  AT CHRISTMAS ISLAND YESTERDAY May 25, 2013

 Three illegal boat arrivals, carrying a total of 211 people, arrived at Christmas Island yesterday, as the boats continue to  flood our borders at an unprecedented rate, Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Shadow Minister  for Justice Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “One of the vessels was initially “detected” by the Australian Federal Police, stationed on Christmas Island - meaning  once again an illegal boat made it all the way to the island undetected until it was in plain sight,” Mr Keenan said.

 “Border Protection Command’s resources are so over stretched that they are regularly relying on Australian Federal Police  to play an increasing role in intercepting illegal boat arrivals.

 “On top of using the AFP to intercept vessels, the Government also recently called on Western Australians, who were  situated in towns up and down our coast, to call a special hotline if they spotted an asylum seeker vessel.

 “It is hard to fathom that Labor has allowed this situation to get so out of control that they now have members of the public  assisting in intercepting illegal boat arrivals.

 “This year there have been several cases of boats making it to the mainland undetected because Border Protection  Command cannot keep up with this ever increasing workload - including one that made it all the way to Geraldton and was  subsequently  intercepted by two local men in a dingy.

 “These types of incidents have turned our once robust border protection system into a laughing stock.

 “Labor has not only allowed this crisis to get completely out of control but they have also attacked the funding and  personnel of the very agencies that are left to clean up this mess.

 “We cannot afford another three years of Labor’s complete border protection failures,” Mr Keenan said.
