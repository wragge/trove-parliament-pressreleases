 Greens Move For Senate Inquiry into DSD Scandal

 The Greens have written to the leader of the Opposition in the Senate requesting that the proposed Senate inquiry into the children overboard incident also investigate the developing Defence Signals Directorate Tampa controversy.

 If the suggestion is not incorporated into the inquiry Senator Brown will seek to amend the proposed terms of reference in the Senate and a new reference as follows:

 How information from the Defence Signals Directorate (DSD) was conveyed to and used by the Government during and since the Tampa crisis.

 The Greens have also requested that the Senate inquiry consider the financial, social and humanitarian costs and international consequences of the 'Pacific Solution' and the use of detention centres for asylum seekers in Australia.

 Tomorrow, Senator Brown will present to the Senate the petition from 2727Tasmanians calling for a more humane approach to asylum seekers, that was presented to him at the rally at Parliament House today.
