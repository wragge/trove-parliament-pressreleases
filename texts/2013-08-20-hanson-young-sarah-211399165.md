 MEDIA RELEASE

 PNG deal challenge highlights cruel policy   

 Labor should be closing the cruel and costly PNG detention centre rather than  expanding it, avoiding the need for an expensive and embarrassing court challenge, the  Australian Greens have said.   

 “Australia is damaging vulnerable refugees by sending them to inadequate tent-slums on  remote Pacific islands. We don’t need a High Court challenge to know that that’s wrong,”  the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The cruel PNG deal is just the latest in the Labor government’s terrible track record of  refugee policies that breach our international obligations.   

 “This accelerated race to the bottom between the old parties is an attack on Australia’s  generous heart.   

 “Instead of solely focussing on cruelty, Australia should be leading a genuine regional  solution as it did in the wake of the Vietnam War.   

 “The billions being spent on the PNG deal should instead be directed to UN, boosting its  ability to process claims in Indonesia, and an emergency intake of 10,000 refugees from  within our region.   

 “Only the Greens are offering humane, practical solutions that would save lives at sea  while caring for refugees.”
