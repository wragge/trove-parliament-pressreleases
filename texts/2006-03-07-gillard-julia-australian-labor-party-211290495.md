 COURAGE, CONVICTIONS & THE COMMUNITY  THE NEXT TEN YEARS   

 Speech by Julia Gillard Shadow Minister for Health  to the Sydney Institute   

 7 March 2006 

 

 

 

 Introduction   

 Last week we saw the Howard Government at its most relaxed and comfortable.   

 Relaxed and comfortable, indeed smug, as the sound of all that back slapping  drowned out the growing concerns of Australians about their future and the nation’s  future.   

 But what’s important isn’t a triumphalist retrospective on the last 10 years.   

 It’s what will happen in the next 10 years.   

 What’s important isn’t cynically clutching a sign that says ‘Right Direction,  Mainstream Values’.    

 It’s setting the right direction for the nation and being prepared to live up to your  values.   

 This is what I want to talk about tonight.   

 

 

  2

 Right Direction   

 It is a truism that if you don’t know where you are going then any road will take you  there.  And the only road the Howard Government has trodden footprints into is the  short term road to political success.   

 It’s convinced Australians that only the Howard Government can be trusted with their  mortgages.   

 It’s bought support with its cheque in the mail culture.   

 And it’s whipped up fear, so that it can then be ready to comfort.   

 I’m sure they all reckon it’s good politics, good politics for them --- but not for  Australia.   

 The Howard Government hasn’t governed by asking Australians to imagine a better   nation and then to contribute to building it.   

 It’s asked Australians to imagine something worse and to shy away from it.   

 But where are the policies to build prosperity past the resources boom?   

 Where are the policies to address poverty and disadvantage?   

 Where are the policies to turn the words ‘a fair go’ from a slogan to a day to day  reality for decent hard working Australians and their children?   

 In my own area of health I’ve been to the future, been to where the Howard  Government’s health policy will lead us.   

 I recently visited the USA and it was there that I saw the ugliness of a world where  the treatment you receive depends on your wealth and your insurance.    

 I recently visited one of the leading cancer hospitals in New York only to be told that  this hospital not only won’t treat people who aren’t insured, it won’t treat people  unless they have the right kind of insurance.   

 And I can see how easily we could wake up in that American health nightmare within  just a few short years.     

 Already Australians are paying more for health services and getting less help to meet  the cost.     

 Already Australians living in the most disadvantaged areas have potentially avoidable  premature death rates 54 per cent higher than those in the most well off areas.    

 And we already know the Howard Government is in the thrall of private health  insurers who are advocating tying insurance to employment.   

  3

 You know you are going in the wrong direction when the painful truth is that in spite  of the medical advances and our economic prosperity, our children are facing a  growing array of chronic illnesses and developmental problems that threaten their  lifespan.  

 

 And the Howard Government stands idly by, while at the same time spruiking its so-called mainstream values.   

 Mainstream Values   

 I didn’t know whether to shudder or laugh when the full cynicism and audacity of the  Howard Government was revealed with its new slogan ‘mainstream values’.   

 It reminded me of John Major’s ‘Back to Basics Campaign’.  The tub thumping, old  fashioned morals campaign that ended up being parodied as the ‘Back to My Place  Campaign’ after the exposure of the Tory’s sex scandals. 

 

 Now I’m not suggesting we will see the Howard Government mired in the same sort  of sex scandals.   

 I suspect they lack the imagination of the British Tories.   

 But the message should be clear that you demonstrate your values by living by them,  not by shouting a hollow slogan.   

 Schools around the country are supposed to be teaching our kids mainstream  Australian values.  Our kids learn about the values of care and compassion; doing  your best; a fair go; freedom; honesty and trustworthiness; integrity; respect;  responsibility; and understanding, tolerance and inclusion.    

 How does the Howard Government measure up against these fine mainstream values?   

 Honesty and trustworthiness?  Integrity?  Responsibility?   

 As the Australian Wheat Board scandal has demonstrated this is a Prime Minister and  a government that has made an art form of picking exactly the right moment to decide  that they don’t want to know anything more about an issue.     

 They always know when they don’t want to know.   

 They always know when they don’t want to take responsibility.   

 Tolerance and inclusion?   

 How does the Treasurer’s speech to this Institute stack up against those values?   

 Can we expect kids to leave school with good values if every time they look at their  government they see adults whose sole concern is what they can get away with rather  than what is right?

 After years of cynicism and low expectations, I believe there is a growing  constituency looking for more than the crafty politician peddling a short term political  fix.   

  5

 

 Labor Vision, Labor Values   

 Undeniably, Australia has enjoyed high levels of economic growth and record levels  of employment.     

 But interestingly, numerous surveys have confirmed that, beyond a certain point,  more and more money can’t buy us happiness.     

 Indeed, we are becoming an increasingly fragmented, individualised and time poor  society, lacking the social structures and networks required to meet our daily needs  and the needs which arise in times of crisis.     

 We have seen growth in incomes, but most of us have little time to enjoy it with our  family and friends.     

 It’s not just commodity fetishism that has failed us.     

 While we can’t and shouldn’t turn back any of the gains made by the gender  revolution, there is a legitimate and deep concern that the huge changes to our society  which started in the 1960’s and 1970’s era of free love have now left us with the era 

 of sex sells --- anything and everything.    

 This commodification of sex and beauty makes its own contribution to a sense of  dislocation and unease in our community.   

 Coupled with this unease and resulting from it, we are seeing an emerging wave of  desire for renewed engagement and a yearning for social solidarity.  This yearning for  connection should not be underestimated as a powerful political force for change. 

 

 For Labor, the next ten years needs to be about responding to these trends while  implementing our traditional values of decency, of a fair go, of understanding that we  can build a shared future that supports those in need and offers a hand up to hard 

 working Australians.   

 The Federal Labor Party has convictions and many Australians share those  convictions.   

 But what Labor has lacked is the courage to express these as clearly and as forcefully  as it should.   

 In order for Labor to revive, it must find that courage.   

 Many reading these words will nod their heads and think of the debates about  refugees or anti-terrorism legislation.   

 But that is not what I mean by these words.   

 For all of the importance of those debates, Labor’s fundamental tradition is not rooted  in individual rights-based politics.   

  6

 

 Labor’s fundamental tradition and the key to its revival lies in focussing on the wealth  and well-being Australians, on their rights and their obligations to each other, on  values in action.     

 And it is on these core issues, the very basis of our tradition, that we have sent mixed  messages over the 10 long years that the Howard Government has been in office.   

 Under Kim Beazley’s leadership, Labor has increasingly put forward its vision about  building both for our future prosperity and investing in community.   

 It’s a good start and more will be revealed in the coming months as we build for  government.    

  7

 Beyond Left and Right   

 We understand that concerns about the Howard Government will not magically  translate into political support for Labor.   

 To get Australians to turn away from the Howard Government and toward Labor, we  need to earn their trust and respect.   

 The Australian Labor Party, like social democrats around the globe, is facing difficult  policy choices about how to fight for equity, security and social mobility in a world in  which nation states are not separated from the global economy or global culture.   

 Indeed, there is a whole body of literature on whether in the broad political spectrum  the terms of ‘Left’ and ‘Right’ mean anything anymore.     

 But if you read the newspapers you would be forgiven for believing that somehow the  next 10 years for Labor is all about Labor’s Right and Labor’s Left and the fighting  between them.   

 Before you can persuade Australians of your credentials to run the country, you have  to show that you can run your political party.      

 And to do that, we must unshackle our Party from factions.     

 It’s time to stop mincing words and acknowledge that factionalism in the Labor Party  is out of control and destructive.   

 Indeed, we are no longer talking about factionalism, we are talking about  fractionalism.   

 A Party in which almost anyone with a pocket full of votes, often procured in dubious  circumstances, believes it is their right to demand something from the Party in return.   

 Labor’s factions have played a role in the past.  A role of maximising the voice of  individuals who wanted to be heard by bringing like-minded individuals together.  At  their best factions have been structures to enable consultation and power sharing.   

 But that’s not what is happening now.   

 The factional structures of Left and Right are now ossified and devoid of meaning.     

 Indeed, the true ideological spectrum within the modern Labor Party has little to do  with the historic labels ‘Left’ and ‘Right’.    

 Within Labor there are those who are attracted to more interventionist economic  models, a position historically associated with the Left.  But some on the Left are  amongst the most ardent advocates of competition policy, of the role of markets, of  ensuring that governments do not allow business to develop into bloated inefficient  monopolies or duopolies, and of the right of workers who are consumers to fair  treatment.  

  8

 

 Within Labor there are those who have a particular moral and ethical standpoint on  questions like abortion and euthanasia.  This view is historically associated with the  Right but some of the most strident pro-choice advocates in our Parliament are in the  Right.   

 What does this tell us?   

 Simply that the factional labels do not mean much any more, which can hardly be a  surprise in a world in which the meaning of the terms ‘left’ and ‘right’ are the subject  of global debate. 

 

 In contemporary Australia, is it any wonder, that an individual Federal Labor Member  of Parliament is capable of being quite ‘right’ on economic questions, quite ‘left’ on  social questions or the other way around?  Indeed, one of the worst ways of trying to  predict what conclusion an individual Member of the Federal Labor Party will come  to on a policy decision is to look at their factional label.   

 In a world in which labelling an individual ‘left’ or ‘right’ can be impossible, it  obviously follows that the labels “Left’ and ‘Right’ on Labor factions are now without  meaning.   

 That doesn’t mean that there aren’t big policy issues at stake, where views differ  sharply and debate is required.  But the current factional structure isn’t in any way  facilitating those unbelievably important debates.  Rather power comes first,  permeated by a winner-take-all culture.  It’s become about who wins, not what for.   

 So what role should the factions play in Labor’s future?   

 Do the benefits of today’s factional system outweigh its risks?   

 Frankly, all I see is risks.   

 The risk that preselecting a person from a particular faction, or indeed sub-faction, or  fraction is more important than getting the best possible candidate.   

 The risk that policy debates are limited to small groups or become the most stylised  clashes about the old disputes between the ‘Left’ and the ‘Right’, not the current true  policy challenges. 

 

 The risk that the bloody struggles within the Labor machine between the fractions  destroy any capacity for a united Labor team.   

 Most members of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party fully understand the  problems with the factions; it's now time to do something about it.    

 We need to break the nexus between stacking branches and being rewarded with jobs.     

 We need to have preselection on merit, always.

 I am not naÃ¯ve enough to think that a simple statement about the destructive nature of  the factions, even one that attracts support, will cause a wind-down in factional  machinery.   

 But I do think there are a number of positive things the Federal Parliamentary Labor  Party can do to change the way it operates and to de-factionalise.     

 Tonight I would like to argue for two such positive changes that should be part of  Labor’s future.   

 1. The Ministry.   

 Shortly after the last election, Kelvin Thomson, the Member for Wills, called on  Labor to think about adopting the system where the Leader picks the Ministry or  Shadow Ministry, as happens with the Liberal Party. 

 

 I believe changing the way we select the Ministry or the Shadow Ministry  warrants serious consideration.     

 The truth is Labor’s election system does not equal a free vote of Caucus.  Instead,  there is a complex set of factional arrangements about the numbers within and  composition of the Ministry or Shadow Ministry.     

 Even worse, factional contests about pre-selections are often viewed through the  prism of which faction or sub-faction that candidate will support for the purpose  of bartering out the Ministry or Shadow Ministry.   

 In the long term, the best possible system is likely to be a Ministry or Shadow  Ministry which is elected by a full free vote of Caucus.  This was the system that  delivered the first Hawke Ministry.  It is also a system that guarantees the Ministry  encompasses all views.   

 But I do not believe we will get to free vote of Caucus, devoid of factional  ticketing in one step.   

 In order to get there, to clear the factions out of the system, I think we need to  send a message right from the top that change is required and the Ministry or  Shadow Ministry is not a creature of the factional system.   

 Labor giving notice that after the next election, in Government or in Opposition, it  would give the Labor Leader the power to appoint all or part of the Ministry or  Shadow Ministry would send such a powerful message.   

 A message that from the very top, that Labor wants to start de-factionalising the  Federal Parliamentary Labor Party and that advancement is not about who  controls which vote, but who is competent, hard working and decent.   

  10

 In the Liberal Party, such a system has led to distortions, to a vengeful Howard  excluding competent Liberal moderates and rewarding incompetent Howard  backers.   

 But even Howard has seen some limits to his power and felt the need to include  and promote Costello supporters like Julie Bishop.   

 In such a system the Leader’s power is not unlimited in the sense that as the  Leader is judging his or her political colleagues, the colleagues are judging the  Leader.  And for the message of the need to de-factionalise to be favourably heard  and received, the Leader would need to ensure the team selected is the best team, a  model of inclusion.   

 For Labor such a change would be the sort of cultural shock to the system that  could break a pattern of entrenched factionalism, indeed fractionalism.   

 This is an idea for the future but it requires consideration and debate --- now.    

 2. The Four Leaders to be beyond factions   

 In the presidential nature of modern politics, it is easy to forget that each side of  politics has four influential leaders; the Prime Minister/Leader of the Opposition,  the Deputy Leader, the Senate Leader and the Deputy Senate Leader. 

 

 The Leadership Group has special rights and heavy responsibilities.   

 It is a group which must always be motivated by what is best for the Party, not any  subset of it.   

 And to visibly demonstrate that sense of responsibility to the whole of the Party,  in my view, on election, each of the four leaders should cease to participate in  their factional activities. 

 

 Once again, this would send a message from the very top that the Federal  Parliamentary Labor Party wants to move beyond factionalism and fractionalism.   

 I am sure that the current arrangement will have defenders who say it is important  to managing the Labor Caucus that the four leaders maintain their relationship  with their factions, particularly the ability to communicate with their factions and 

 steer decision making.   

 But that very argument shows the nature of the problem.  Federal Labor should  not be view as a federation of fiefdoms.  Each of the four Leaders is not a delegate  or representative of his or her faction or fraction.     

 Each of the four Leaders has an obligation to engage, inform and involve every  Caucus member and particularly the whole backbench in designing and  implementing the strategy to achieve government. 

 

  11

 Kim Beazley understands this clearly and makes himself available in a number of  formal and informal ways to all Caucus members.   

 It is time to take the next step.   

 Currently Labor’s ‘Left’ and ‘Right’ factions meet on Monday afternoons during  sitting weeks.  Wouldn’t it be a major step forward if at that time each Monday the  four leaders convened meetings for an open, inclusive, free flowing exchange of  ideas and strategies about improving this country, about helping its people, about  winning elections.  A time when debate would be seen to be a good thing.  A  space where the big policy issues could be thrashed out and each different  contribution heard and treated with respect.   

 Obviously these two reforms are the starting point, not an end point.   

 But importantly these two reforms are entirely within the decision making power of  the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party.   

 And while the ideas have merit in themselves, their symbolic importance is almost as  significant.   

 Adopting these reforms is a way of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party telling the  world it knows the factions and fractions are a cancer eating away at the very fabric of  the Labor Party and everybody knows it.  We need to stop pretending the problem  will go away without treatment.  It's time for the leaders of the Labor Party to do  something about it.   

  12

 Conclusion   

 To win the next election, to regain the trust of the Australian people, Labor must  demonstrate our commitment and ability to boldly build a new and better Australia.   An Australia that truly enables our people to achieve the great Australian dream of  love and family, cocooned in security and with a real chance at getting ahead. 

 

 We must demonstrate the highest ethical standards in how we operate.  Saying we are  no worse than the other guys isn’t anywhere near good enough.  On the question of  standards in government - openness, accountability, divorcing the workings of  government from the influence peddlers and the donors - we need to be absolutely  right, not just better by comparison.  On the question how we treat each other we must  show our values in action.   

 We must build the next wave of prosperity by investing in communities, in skills and  infrastructure, and by including in our economy those who are so easily left behind.     

 Stopping the human waste caused by inter-generational welfare and low achievement  from Australia’s pockets of disadvantage.     

 Fixing the human tragedy of having a population that isn’t as healthy as it could be.     

 Addressing the human cost of marginalising sections of our society.   

 We must develop the bold social policies that don’t tinker at the edges of social  problems, but drive at their heart.   

 It’s a big agenda.   

 But it’s a Labor agenda that can be delivered by a party with courage, including the  courage to renew itself.
