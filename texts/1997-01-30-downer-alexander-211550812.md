  MEDIA RELEASE  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  ALEXANDER DOWNER 

  EMBARGOED: 2330 Canberra time. 

  A/V. 30 January 1997 

  HELPING REBUILD HOUSES IN FORlviER YUG OSLA VIA 

  I am pleased to announce that I have today delivered a cheque for A$1 million to l'v1rs  Ogata, the United Na tions High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHC R) to help finance  the UN11CR 's vital work in tbe former Yugoslavia. 

  The funds will be used in the UNHCR ' s shelter program which is repairing and  rebuilding houses in the war ravaged region. The UNHCR is the leading international  agency stri ving to assist in bringing about a return to normalcy following the years of  civil war w hich ended with the signing of the D ayton Peace Accord in Novembe r 

  1995. 

  Of the 2 million people displaced by the war, {JNHCR estimates that only 250 000  have been able to return to their homes since the peace agreement. The lack of  available housing has been a major impediment to repatriating refugees and displaced  people. For examp le, 60 per cent of the housing in Bosnia and Herzegovina was  damaged during the conflict. 

  Channelling Australian assistance through the UNHCR ensures that Australia 's aid will  reach people most in need regardless of race or religion. 

  This grant brings the total humanitarian assistance provided by the Australian  Government's aid agency, .-\usAID, to the former Yugo slavia to A$10 .5 mi llion. 

  In addition to responding to particu lar appeals issued by UNHC R- such as their appeal  to assist in the former Yug oslavia which I have responded to today-the .-\ustralian  Government this year contributed .-\S 13 .5 million to the UNHCR ' s general program  budget.
