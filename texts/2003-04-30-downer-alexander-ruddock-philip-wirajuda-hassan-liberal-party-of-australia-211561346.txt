 E and OE

 30 April 2003

 Press Conference by co-Chairs and participating Ministers. Bali  Conference, Indonesia

 Transcription (English only)

 Wirajuda:  Colleagues, friends and media. The Second Bali Regional Ministers Conference on  People Smuggling Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crimes held from 28 to 30  April has just been concluded.  The conference endorsed the co-Chairs statement which, I  believe, is available for you all.  The conference was attended by 32 participating countries  from Asia Pacific regions as well as 14 observer countries from different regions such as North  America, Europe and Africa.  11 international organisations attended the conference and over  300 participants registered, among them Ministers and Vice Ministers from the Asia Pacific  region as well as other regions.  Following the first Bali Regional Ministers Conference here in  Bali in February last year, two adhoc experts groups which were chaired by Thailand and New  Zealand, worked very actively and held a number of meetings, workshops and surveys were  held and the results of this process were reported to the Second Bali Ministerial Conference.   Indeed, within one year the conference has made remarkable progress and we noted the  enthusiasm on the part of participating countries and major organisations.  As you know the  Bali process was intended to end at this conference, but in our discussions we have agreed  that the work of two adhoc expert groups will continue and we have agreed to convene an  annual senior officials meeting.  We have also agreed to convene a Ministerial Conference  within the next two to three years to review the progress of the Bali process and provide  further guidance.  Indeed, we agreed to continue to work as the problem of illegal migrants is  a continuing issue,  but we agreed to maintain the momentum and to hold another conference  in two or three years time. 

 Downer:  Thank you very much Hassan.  Can I just say as the co-Chair of the Second Bali  Regional Ministerial Conference how delighted we have been with the success of the  conference.  This is an incremental process.  It has been important to build awareness and  build capacities through the Asia Pacific region in order to address the problem of people  smuggling and people trafficking.  It is going to take more time and more effort.  The Bali  process has been an essential part of ensuring that the regional community, and that is a  fairly broadly defined region, is heavily focussed on this as one of the many issues as a region  we do need to address.  This time 28 Ministers from 32 countries attended and we were very  pleased also to have the presence of the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees, Mr  Lubbers, and also representation from the International Organisation of Migration the IOM.   One of the truly important components of this discussion over the last couple of days was the  way Ministers came to the view that instead of bringing the Bali process to an end, they 

 unanimously wanted it to continue.  They wanted not just the adhoc experts groups to  continue their work and to report to officials in a year’s time, but they wanted the Ministerial  involvement to continue as well.  We are very encouraged by that, it is a very positive sign  because the officials initially had thought that the Ministerial process could come to an end  here, but the Ministers themselves unanimously wanted the ministerial process to continue so  the Bali process continues and it’s not just a two-off event.    I think countries are gaining a  great deal from the way the process works in order to try to address this problem as best they  can and of course they are having some success in dealing with the problem.  Can I thank our  co-Chairs and not just the Indonesian Foreign Minister, but his department and the people of  Bali for their hospitality.  We are delighted to be here and work in this close and cooperative  way with our friends and neighbours, the Indonesians.  Thank you very much.

 Journalist:  Can you provide us with a few details.  There is report that a second boat of  Vietnamese had been found near Flores.  Could you just tell us the status of that?

 Wirajuda:  Frankly, I don’t have any official information yet.  I will need to check with my  colleagues and the Head of the National Police.  But, yes I have heard this unofficially.   To us  the flow of these boat people from Vietnamese is an anomaly.  First following the Bali  Conference last year, we noted that there was no new flow of illegal migrants coming to our  region and certainly not from, even in the past, Vietnam.  I believe, as an anomaly, we can  work closely with Australia, but of course also with Vietnam who are active participants in this  conference, with a view to returning the boat people back to Vietnam as soon as possible.

 Downer:  Can I just add that we have been pleased with the way the Indonesian Government  has been handling this issue and I want to thank them very much for their continuing  cooperation in this area and it is a reflection of the strength of the relationship that we are  able to work through these issues as they arise.  As the Indonesian Foreign Minister has said,  we do regard these particular incidents of the two boats as being somewhat anomalous.  The  general problem of people smuggling to our region has subsided substantially, but we can  never afford to be complacent.  We cannot be complacent with any of the problems we have  as a region, we just have to keep working at it.

 Ruddock:  The only other observation I’d make is not to assume that you won’t see  opportunistic adventures from time to time.  What we know is that the two vessels involved  have not been organised people smuggling or trafficking, but rather opportunistic voyages by  people who were at previous times, in some cases, in Indonesia and had been returned home  to Vietnam.  What is quite clear is that we have a situation where there is an issue that will  have to be managed.  I understand both vessels are essentially immobile and we very much  value the cooperation of Indonesia.  Might I say that we stand ready to assist in any way that  Indonesia sees appropriate.

 Indonesian questions and answers

 Journalist:  …(inaudible)…reference Indonesian people smuggling.

 Wirajuda:  Yes, I understand that the drafting process is almost complete, but certainly it is  the strong desire on the part of the government to complete this process as soon as possible I  promise you.   We don’t know how long it will take, but there is need strengthen the legal  infrastructure including putting in our criminal law provisions on criminality of illegal migrants.

 Journalist:  …(inaudible)…

 Downer:  What the Bali process has done is to very effectively ensure that those countries  that participate, and we are talking 32 countries at this meeting and a similar number at the  first Bali meeting,  focus on what measures they need to take to ensure that this people  smuggling problem abates and they have been taking measures.  Those sorts of measures  have also been considered collectively through the two adhoc experts groups.  The adhoc  experts groups have made recommendations of quite a wide variety spelt out in the Joint  Statement by the co-Chairs.  Of course, it is up to countries individually in the main to  implement those types of recommendations and proposals, but they are gradually doing that.   The experts have also been able to produce draft legislation, for example, on criminalising  people smuggling. They have been able to provide a great deal of technical advice on how to  manage the issue and much more, out of the public gaze.   As a result of the Bali process  there has been a much greater degree of cooperation between Police and Intelligence services  in regional countries in getting them to understand and track down people smuggling  activities.  You go back two years I don’t think our knowledge, as a region, of how people  smuggling rackets actually worked was anything like the knowledge we have today - the  people involved, the paths that they use, the methods that they use -we have greatly  enhanced knowledge.  It is the Bali process which has really provided the framework for this  type of cooperation.  I think it has been very important to have this region-wide cooperation  rather just leave it as a bilateral issue between Australia and Indonesia.  There are bilateral  aspects to it, but we, both Indonesia and Australia, have very much wanted to focus on this  thing as a regional problem which needs a regional solution, not just a bilateral problem that  needs bilateral solutions.  I think we have been much more effective in getting the region to  focus on the issue by using the Bali process than we would have been had we just dealt with  each other and that had been the sum total of it.    I don’t want to mention the countries by  name, but what it has done is given a real focus for countries that might not have thought a  great deal about this issue, but which had nevertheless been in some cases transit countries  or countries which have been exploited by people smugglers.  It has given them a real focus  that they have a problem within their countries that needs to be addressed and those  countries have been addressing the problem.  I mean this is the great strength of the Bali  process.  The Bali process doesn’t legislate, the Bali process doesn’t force anybody to do  anything.  What it does do is provide frameworks, it provides context, it provides priority and I  think it has been extraordinarily successful and in fact, it has been one of the more successful  endeavours that Australia and Indonesia collectively have undertaken.

 Ruddock:  If I may just complement the answers that have been given with some  measurable outcomes because I think it is important that there is no one answer -there are a  range of measures that are implemented.  If you look at the outcome and in Australia we have  been saying there have been no boat arrivals for 18 months  of substance.  In relation to  Indonesia, what Foreign Minister Wirajuda was saying, was that there has been no  replenishment in Indonesia of further unlawful arrivals looking to be trafficked or having been  trafficked here.  If you actually look at the numbers of people in Indonesia that have been  here and have been in the hands of the International Organisation for Migration arranging for  their return home or have been assessed by the UNHCR, we are now dealing with very modest  numbers because there has been no replenishment and the circumstances of those people  who are here are being resolved.  None of that has happened by accident.  If you look at  other regions in the world, the degree of cooperation that has been achieved here that is  evidenced by this process is really quite unique for this region in terms of the results that  have been achieved and quite different to what you are seeing elsewhere.

 Journalist:  …(inaudible)…

 Ruddock:  I don’t think it is pushing the problem elsewhere.  It demonstrates to other 

 regions that if they have a determination to deal with it there are a range of measures that  are open to them.

 Downer:  I think that is the key point.  I mean, we see this as a problem as a region.   We  want to address it as a region.  We cannot speak for every other part of the world.  Our advice  to other countries outside of the region is that they need to manage this issue just as we do.    Nobody that I have ever come across wants to encourage this grizzly trade of people  smuggling.  I think in the last four or five years many countries have been wrestling with this,  trying to work out what to do about it, and quite a lot of high profile, fierce even, debates  within countries about how to manage this issue.  The one interesting thing is that now,  particularly in the last 18 months, there is a growing global consensus that this is a problem  and it needs to be dealt with.  We shouldn’t be naive in how we handle it.  Other countries  outside the region, for example the European Union, are now starting to handle these issues  much more effectively and we have had, by the way, extremely good relations with the  European Commission and some of the individual member states of the European Union in  addressing this issue with the United Kingdom, the Germans and so on, but importantly with  the European Commission. I can see a real sea change in Europe in how they address this  issue as well.

 Indonesian questions and answers

 Wirajuda:  In 1999 we had in Indonesia 3832 illegal migrants.  Now 478 individuals remain  in Indonesia, among them 600 have voluntarily returned to Afghanisation.

 Indonesian questions and answers

 Press Conference ends

 Supplementary questions from Indonesian and Australian journalists.

 Journalist:  …(inaudible)…Aceh?

 Downer:  That’s ultimately an internal matter for Indonesia to resolve and we hope that it will  be possible to get back on to the diplomatic path to resolve it, but we offer no gratuitous  advice to the Indonesian Government on how to manage this issue, except to say that we  hope it can be managed.

 Journalist:  …(inaudible)…

 Downer:  We hope it will be resolved in a diplomatic, peaceful and constructive way.  The  process has taken a setback recently and we hope that the negotiations will resume before too  long.

 Journalist:  …(inaudible)…the boat in Flores?

 Downer:  We understand that the boat has come to an island in the Flores region and  Indonesian authorities and the International Organisation of Migration are going to meet up  with the people from the boat.  The OIM and the Indonesians will process them in the  appropriate way.

 Ruddock:  The only point I’d make is that I understand that this vessel is not fit for further  travel.

 Journalist:  It says on the Antara wire that in fact the reason that they have been prevented  from going further, at least not assisted to go further, is because of an agreement with the  Australian Police.

 Downer:  Not a formal agreement, a written agreement, no.  But we obviously made contact  with the Indonesians some time ago about these boats and we explained yesterday, and  maybe the day before as well, that we want to handle this in a low key way and we are very  happy with the way the Indonesians have handled it.  They are also having discussions, we  understand, with the Vietnamese about it as the people involved are Vietnamese and they will  want to have those people repatriated to Vietnam.  But I am very, very happy about the way  the Indonesians have handled it, but we are for our part very consciously handling this in a  low key way and we have found that to be the most effective way of managing these issues  with Indonesia.

 Journalist:  But you have known about it for a couple of days?

 Downer:  You mean about exactly where it is and what happened?

 Journalist:  Yes.

 Downer:  A couple of days I suppose, a day or two.  Yes I must say I was aware yesterday.

 Ruddock:  There may have been …(inaudible)…

 Journalist:  You are entirely confident…?

 Downer:  I was entirely confident.  Remember I have been at lunches and dinners with the  Indonesian Foreign Minister for the last two days.

 Journalist:  But, you knew it had been shipwrecked somewhere….

 Downer:  I don’t remember exactly when I found out all of the details, but obviously for some  time we have been talking to the Indonesians about these boats, starting with our embassy  well before I got here.  Our embassy has been talking with Indonesian authorities about them  and they have been responding appropriately.  We are happy with the way they have handled  it.

 Journalist:  There is no word of further boats coming from Vietnam?

 Downer:  Haven’t heard of any, no. Do I know something I am not passing around?  No I  don’t.
