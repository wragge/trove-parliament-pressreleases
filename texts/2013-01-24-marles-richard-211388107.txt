 Australia gives $2 million to help feed refugees in Horn of Africa    

 Australia will provide $2 million to help the United Nations World Food Programme  (WFP) feed 575,000 refugees in Kenya that have fled war and drought in the region.    

 Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs Richard Marles announced the assistance  while meeting refugees at the Dadaab camp in Kenya, near the Somali border. Dadaab is  the largest refugee camp in the world.    

 “Australia’s contribution will help WFP provide food and nourishment to almost 20,000  more people, including malnourished children, pregnant and breast feeding women,”  Mr Marles said.    

 “Food is also distributed to schools to encourage attendance and at training centres to  assist young people gain essential life and job skills.”    

 Australia was one of the largest donor countries to the 2011 Horn of Africa crisis,  providing more than $112 million in humanitarian assistance.    

 During his visit in Kenya, Mr Marles also discussed efforts to promote stability within  Somalia with Kenya’s Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs and the United Nations Special  Representative and Head of the United Nations Political Office for Somalia, Mr  Augustine Mahiga.    

 “Beyond our support for refugees in Dadaab, Australia will be closely involved in  supporting Somali and African-led efforts to promote peace and recovery in Somalia  during our term on the UN Security Council.”
