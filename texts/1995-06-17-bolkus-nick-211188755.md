  MEDIA RELEASE  Senator Nick Bolkus

  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC  AFFAIRS AND MINISTER ASSISTING THE PRIME  MINISTER FOR MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS 

  Parliament House Canberra ACT 2600  (06) 277 7860 

  FULL FEDERAL COURT OVERTURNS SACKVILLE ON REFUGEE DEFINITION 

  The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus, has welcomed  today's ruling by the Full Federal Court that parents in China with one child do not constitute  a 'particular social group' under the United Nations Refugee Convention. 

  The Full Court decision overturns a ruling by Justice Sackville last December that a Chinese  couple came within the refugee definition because they formed part of a social group in  respect of which PRC fertility control policies discriminated against parents with more than  one child. 

  "I appealed that decision on the grounds that the Sackville interpretation of 'particular social  group' was too broad, created uncertainty and made the Convention definition almost  impossible to apply," Senator Bolkus said. 

  "The Government's approach on this issue has been completely vindicated. " 

  Senator Bolkus said the full implications of the decision had yet to be examined, and noted  that the applicant's counsel may be considering a further appeal to the High Court. 

  "However today's decision obviously has implications for the Migration Legislation  Amendment Bill (No.4) 1995," he said. 

  The Bill seeks to correct the Sackville decision through legislation, but the backlog of  legislation before Parliament has delayed its debate in the Senate. 

  "The legal issues involved are complex, and the decision and any implications it may have  for the No.4 Bill will be carefully considered," Senator Bolkus said.
