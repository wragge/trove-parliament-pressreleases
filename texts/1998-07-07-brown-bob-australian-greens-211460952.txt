  Downer Should tell Habibie ‘Free West Papua’

 Greens call on eve of 
talks in Jakarta

  

  Tuesday, 7 July, 1998

  

  West Papua (Irian Jaya) is on the brink of all-out rebellion an d 
a mounting toll of injury and death. Australia should urge restraint 
on the Indonesian military and back a plebiscite on independence for 
the colony, Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.

  

 Australia’s Foreign Minister Alexander Downer will 
visit Indonesia this week.

  

 “These are Australia’s nearest neighbours. West 
Papua is closer than East Timor. Since the Indonesian paratroops dropped 
into West Papua and illegally annexed the country the Free Papua Movement 
has been fighting for self determination”, said Senator Brown.

  

 “The result has been thousands of deaths, torture 
and execution of political prisoners, and more than 10 000 refugees 
fleeing into Papua-New Guinea.

  

 “The repression of West Papua is no less than China’s 
repression of Tibet.

  

 “The Howard Government’s silence on this issue 
is appalling. Australia should also reverse the previous Labor Government’s 
decision to ban West Papuan refugees,” said Senator Brown.

  

 Last week the Coalition-Labor majority voted down 
Senator Brown’s motion calling for action over West Papua.
