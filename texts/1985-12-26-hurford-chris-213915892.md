 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION  AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 MPS 91/85 26 December 1985

 A MORE COMPREHENSIVE MIGRANT SETTLEMENT SERVICE INITIATED

 Australia now had its most comprehensive migrant settlement   services network ever,  the Federal Minister for Immigration   and Ethnic Affairs,  Chris Hurford,  said today.

 He was announcing more than 60 new grants for migrant welfare   .services worth $2.03 million.

 'These new grants, some of which are specifically directed to   migrant women, bring the number operating throughout Australia   to 2041  Mr Hurford said.

 'They are just one element of our post-arrival services,   designed to promote quick and successful settlement of   migrants and refugees into the Australian community.

 'The Hawke Labor Government is committed to achieving social   justice and equity through our migrant settlement policies as   elsewhere'.

 To this end, Mr Hurford said, the Government had:

 boosted funding for the Adult Migrant Education Program   from $35 million in 1982 to $45 million this financial   year

 made a total of $1.8 million available to the States to   develop and extend interpreting and translating   services, and

 almost doubled the grant-in-aid scheme, with more than   $6.2 million going to ethnic and community groups each   year for welfare programs.

 The following grants are directed primarily at migrant  women:

 Victoria - The Australian-Vietnamese Women's Welfare  .  Association will concentrate on young Vietnamese mothers  and their families.  Almost half the Vietnamese females in  Victoria are aged 15-29, and many do not have parents or 

 other family in Australia for support.

 Queensland - Family Care will provide welfare support to  Filipino women and children in the far north of the State.

 South Australia - Women's Emergency shelter will  concentrate on community development, including the  recruitment and training of volunteers to work with  migrant women in crisis. Their existing grant will be  extended for 12 months.

 Organisations receiving funding for the first time include

 NSW - The Cabramatta Community Centre will develop  services for the Timorese community in Fairfield and  surrounding areas.

 Victoria - The Vietnamese Community of Victoria, an  umbrella organisation of 27 affiliates, will develop  welfare services for the Vietnamese community, including  special services to meet the needs of women and the aged.

 Queensland - The Brisbane Women's Community Health Centre  will increase the access of migrant women to health  services, and make health workers more aware of migrant  women's needs. The worker will concentrate particularly 

 on helping Vietnamese and South American women.

 South Australia - The Cambodian-Australian Association  will develop services for "Cambodians and Laotians,  particularly refugees.

 Western Australia - The Ethnic Communities Council will  develop an information network among ethnic groups and  link such groups with community services. Special  assistance will be given to newer ethnic communities who  do not have their own worker.

 Mr Hurford said that the extra $2.03 million in grants would  allow 68 social welfare workers to be employed by 53 migrant   organisations. â 

 The grants comprise 63 full grants and five half grants.  A  full grant covers the cost of employing a welfare worker full  time for three years to provide specialised services to help  migrants and members of ethnic communities to become 

 self-reliant. Half grants cover the cost of a part-time  worker for the same period.

 Advertisements seeking applications for grants available next  financial year will be published in March 1986. The  successful applicants will be announced at the end of 1986.

 Mr Hurford said that, as well as substantial increases in  funding of migrant welfare programs and services,  the  Government also had:

 .  extended transmissions by the Special Broadcasting Service to areas of Australia previously unable to  receive multicultural television.

 .  developed a new charter and goals for the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs. -

 .  committed itself to helping migrants and ethnic communities gain more access to and a fair share of the  resources applied to standard community programs and  services.

 'These initiatives will quicken the pace of public education   towards a better understanding of our ethnically and  culturally diverse society.1  he said.
