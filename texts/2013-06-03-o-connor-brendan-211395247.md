 THE HON BRENDAN O’CONNOR MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Monday, 3 June 2013   

 BISHOP ACCUSES INDONESIAN AMBASSADOR OF LYING   

 Julie Bishop’s unprecedented attack on the credibility of the Indonesian Ambassador’s public  comments must be quickly explained, or apologised for.   

 The Deputy Opposition Leader must reveal why she accused the Ambassador of lying after he  publicly ruled out the Coalition’s shambolic plan to turn back the boats.   

 Before the Ambassador unequivocally declared Indonesia would not support the Coalition’s plan  to turn back boats:   

 Lenore Taylor: “So they (Indonesia) would take boats back?”   

 Julie Bishop: “…professional diplomats are paid to present, aah, particular views but what goes on  behind the scenes can be quite different - what people say privately can be different to what they say  publicly…”   

 When asked about the Ambassador’s comments:   

 Julie Bishop: “I would expect the ambassador to say those things publicly.”   

 Ms Bishop has made it crystal clear she believes the Indonesian Ambassador is lying to the public  and telling her something different behind closed doors.   

 Ms Bishop’s extraordinary slur against the Ambassador must be substantiated with details of her  private agreement with the Indonesian Government to co-operate with the Coalition on asylum  seeker policy.   

 If Ms Bishop can’t explain her comments, she must apologise to the Ambassador for calling him a  liar.
