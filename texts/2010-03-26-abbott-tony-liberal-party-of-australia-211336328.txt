 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH   

 26 March 2010 

 

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   DOORSTOP INTERVIEW,   SYDNEY  

 

 Subjects: Opening of Liberal House Bennelong; border protection; shadow ministerial arrangements; waste  and mismanagement in the school halls programme.       

 E&OE……………………….………………………………………………………………………………..   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I’m very pleased to be here to officially open Liberal House Bennelong. Bennelong is obviously one of the  key seats in the coming election. I think that Bennelong is probably as crucial as any seat in this coming  election. I think we’ve got an outstanding candidate in John Alexander. I think that John Alexander is the  man that the people of Bennelong need to fight for them. If you want to vote against the kind of waste and  extravagance that we’ve seen from the Rudd Government, if you want to oppose the waste of money that  we’ve seen on school halls and pink batts, if you want strong border protection, if you want a strong  economy, John Alexander is the man.    

 Just on the subject of border protection, what we have got is a Government in denial. Since Mr Rudd  weakened the former policy which stopped the boats we’ve had almost a hundred boats, we’ve had almost  four-and-a-half thousand unauthorised arrivals. It’s just not good enough. The basic, fundamental job of any  government is protection of our borders. As a sovereign nation we must protect our borders. Mr Rudd has  lost control of our borders and because he has lost control he’s lost interest. Now, he has got to pay attention  here. It’s just not good enough to have boat after boat arriving on our shores. He’s already got hundreds of  people living in tents on Christmas Island. He’s already taken hundreds of people off Christmas Island onto  the mainland before their processing has been finished. He’s broken promise after promise in this vital area  and it’s about time he wakes up to the threat that this constitutes. Any questions?   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, Mr Rudd was on 3AW this morning and says that he has no idea about the Hey Dad! sex scandal  that’s been across every media over the past week. What do you make of that this morning considering he  has so much to say about other similar incidents?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I think it’s important that politicians try to stay in touch. On the other hand, there are lots of things  which happen in our community which politicians for all sorts of reasons don’t comment about.

 QUESTION:   

 Tony, on the education revolution, there’s a school in Port Macquarie with an outdoor shaded area…  claimed cost a million dollars. What’s your thoughts on that?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, this is typical of the rip-off after rip off-which we have seen and just as Mr Rudd is in denial about the  chaos with our borders, Julia Gillard is in denial about the rip-offs in our schools. Now everyone wants to  see our schools getting proper infrastructure but that’s no excuse for wasting money.  A week ago I was  down at the Mount St Thomas School in Wollongong and parents were white hot with anger about the waste  that they saw. They wanted a better deal for their school but they were ashamed of the fact that tax payers’  money was being wasted. Frankly it is a humiliation to so many of these schools that they are getting new  infrastructure at an absolutely bloated price. They want to get it for the right price, they could get it for the  right price, if it wasn’t for the fact that Labor is incapable of managing money they would get it for the right  price.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, there’s no disquiet within the Liberal party is there? Barnaby Joyce has come out this morning  and said that there were few MPs that were, I guess, hoping he would fail in the shadow finance portfolio  and given that he was removed from that yesterday are you concerned that there may be some rogue MPs  looking to cause some trouble?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I think Barnaby has done a really outstanding job since he’s joined our frontbench. I think he’s popularised  debt and deficit. I think people are now talking about Labor’s debt and deficit in a way they weren’t before  and what I now want is to see Barnaby barnstorming the country highlighting the waste and mismanagement  which we have seen in so many other programmes from this Labor Government.   

 QUESTION:   

 Are you concerned though that there is potential for disquiet given what he said this morning and the fact  that seems to think that people wanted him out of that?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 The only people who have been criticising Barnaby are the Labor Party and they’re unhappy because he’s  been telling home truths about them. They know that when Barnaby talks about debt and deficit people  listen, and they don’t like it. That’s why they’re critical of him.   

 QUESTION:   

 What do you say to critics who say that Barnaby Joyce should have been removed from the finance portfolio  earlier perhaps?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I think that having Barnaby on the frontbench in an important portfolio has been a really important part of  the Coalition’s recent success. He’s probably Australia’s best retail politician. No one can read the popular  mood and speak the popular language like Barnaby and I’m really pleased to have him in this new and even  more important shadow portfolio.

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, did you have colleagues come to you asking you to take him [inaudible]?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 No.   

 QUESTION:   

 Quickly, just on the education revolution if we can, that funding [inaudible]?    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, we need to expose the rip-offs. Now I know that right around Australia state education departments  and Julia Gillard’s department are trying to browbeat school principals and browbeat Parents and Citizens  presidents into keeping quiet about the rip-offs. Now, I’d say to anyone who’s got a rip-off going on in their  school, expose it. Tell your local paper, tell the Today programme, tell your local Member of Parliament, if  the local Member of Parliament doesn’t want to hear because he or she is a Labor Member, tell the nearest  Liberal politician that you can get access to. Tell us what is going wrong, because it is only when we know  what’s going wrong that we can stop what’s going wrong, and I think it’s really important that we don’t end  up getting $5 billion worth of value out of a $17 billion programme. I know Julia Gillard says ‘oh, you’ve  got to excuse a bit of waste and a bit of mismanagement because, hell, that’s what it takes to save jobs’.  Wrong. Wasting money does not save jobs. Investing money wisely in the future saves jobs and that’s not  what we’re getting through this programme.               

 Thank you.
