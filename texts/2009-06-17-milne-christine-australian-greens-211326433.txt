 SENATOR CHRISTINE MILNE'S NATIONAL PRESS CLUB  SPEECH 17 JUNE, 2009   

 Thank you for your warm welcome. I begin by acknowledging the Ngunnawal  people, the traditional owners of the land.   

 Gandhi once said, “The difference between what we do and what we are capable  of doing would suffice to solve  most of the world’s problems.”   

 We have reached a point in human history where “what we do” on this planet  imperils our survival. Now is the  moment to re-imagine and reconsider “what we are capable of doing”.   

 As Kofi Annan said recently, “The world is at a crossroads. [The Copenhagen]  negotiators [must] come to the  most ambitious agreement ever negotiated or continue to accept mass  starvation, mass sickness and mass  migration on an ever growing scale. Weak leadership,” he said, “is failing  humanity.”   

 So what is stopping us from achieving what we are capable of, of reaching ‘the  most ambitious agreement ever  negotiated’?   

 ABARE, the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, last year unwittingly  provided me with the answer!  They had sought a meeting on their latest modelling of the economic costs of  climate action. I asked them what  atmospheric carbon concentrations they were assuming in their models and was  astonished to hear that they  had modelled nothing lower than 575 parts per million — a level that every  projection tells us would trigger  catastrophic climate change.   

 When I suggested that it might be appropriate to run their models using  scenarios that have some hope of  constraining global warming to merely dangerous levels, even down as low as  350 ppm to deliver a safe  climate, my astonishment was matched by theirs.   

 But, Senator,” came the reply, “that would be a different world!”   

 Exactly! 

 

 This is a cultural problem. It is not a lack of climate science that holds back  action. It is how we respond to the   

 challenge that the science poses, and that is deeply cultural. It is the values that  we bring to bear, what we think  is good for us, our religious underpinnings, our view of power and opportunity,  of what is possible in the world  and Australia’s place in it. All these value judgements stop us from embracing  change.   

 Machiavelli understood human nature when in the 15th Century, he said:   

 It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more  perilous to conduct, or more  uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of  things. Because the innovator has  for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm  defenders in those who may do well  under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the  laws on their side, and partly  from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had  a long experience of them.   

 In Australia, the dominant economic, social and therefore Labor and Coalition  view, is that resource extraction  underpins wealth, power and influence — always has and always will. Regardless  of the physical capacity of  the Earth to sustain it, regardless of the collapse of the Murray Darling or the  climate impact of burning more  coal or logging more forests, nothing will stand in the way of that extraction  continuing. All policies to address  climate change are seen through that cultural lens.   

 That is why we did not have a Green New Deal in Australia linking climate  policies with economic stimulus and it  is why we engage in special pleading in international climate negotiations.   

 It is why, when people hear the climate science telling us that, if we do not act  swiftly and decisively, the world  we hand on to our children will be a very different, much poorer world, so many  jump through hoops to deny it, to  explain it away, or to pretend that we can compromise with the laws of physics  and chemistry to suit own  imperatives. It is no wonder, as Ian Dunlop observed recently, “climate policy  and climate science are like ships 

 passing in the night.”   

 The truth is the climate nightmare is real and happening now. We are destroying  the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu  and the snow caps. We are eroding our beaches, and our coastal cities will face  managed retreat due to sea  level rise. We are drying our food bowl, the Murray Darling, beyond repair,  jeopardising rural communities and  our food security.   

 Many of our Asia Pacific neighbours are struggling with rising seas and extreme  weather which threatens a  refugee crisis beyond anything we’ve ever seen.   

 The Himalayan glaciers, which feed all the major rivers of Asia — the Ganges  and Brahmaputra, the Mekong,  the Yellow and Yangtze — are melting away. Once they are gone, a third of the  world’s people face a  parched, hungry and, most likely, violent future.   

 Red Cross figures reveal that last year 242,662 people died because of climate  related heat waves, fires and  other extreme weather events and spreading tropical diseases, with at least 800  in Australia. According to  Nature, 15%-37% of all species on Earth will be committed to extinction by  2050.   

 If the Arctic melt already underway triggers the melting of the permafrost,  belching billions of tonnes of methane  into the atmosphere, all bets are off as far as warming is concerned. Our planet  will head into a runaway heating  cycle, leading to widespread inundation, agricultural collapse, loss of drinking  water for a third of the global  population, and all the geopolitical and security implications that follow,  particularly with nuclear armed giants  sitting at the epicentre.   

 What is more alarming is that our governments, while claiming to take  responsible action, are effectively  planning to let this happen. The Rudd Government soothes critics by talking  about a global target of 450 ppm  CO2e while putting forward a plan that is actually consistent with 550 ppm or  even higher. They also fail to say  that 450 ppm would, according to the conservative and already out-of-date IPCC  estimates, give us a 50-90% 

 chance of exceeding 2 degrees warming, risking triggering the nightmare  scenario I just outlined.  50 to 90%.   

 Would you put your son or daughter on an aeroplane if you knew that it had a  50-90% chance of crashing? If  not, why would you take that risk with the whole planet?   

 CSIRO scientist James Risbey who came before our recent Senate Inquiry into  Climate Policy told us that: “a  safer target would be something that would be closer to 350 parts per million,  because that would reduce the  risk of exceeding two degrees Celsius to more moderate levels.”   

 Dr Risbey is not a radical or an extremist. He echoes the work of great names in  climate science like NASA’s   James Hansen and Potsdam’s John Schellnhuber, who, together with 50 nations,  are all calling for targeting 350 ppm.   

 No Australian Parliamentarian can say they were not warned.   

 But, as the global ecosystem impacts of climate change become clearer, policy  makers are focussing more  narrowly on the politics of national sovereignty. Our governance systems are not  up to the challenge. Global  warming has become just another issue to be managed in news bulletins.  Meeting after meeting, document  after document are mistaken for action. But no systemic action is being taken.   

 The fact is we cannot keep a safe climate and keep burning coal, oil and gas,  and logging our forests. One or  the other must go.   

 That we may be undone by the refusal, for what ever reason, to believe that  another world is possible was  demonstrated again this week, with Minister Wong saying: “going further is not  possible without causing  economic disruption — if it is possible at all.” Minister Wong, do you really want  “running up the white flag” to  be your legacy?   

 A self interested failure of imagination, courage and leadership characterises the  political and business  establishment in this country.   

 So, it is the job of those who are currently lukewarm defenders of the future, to  get over fear or timidity and to  move to red hot advocacy; to get behind the community and the Greens in  changing the culture, in selling the  dream.   

 Does anyone in this room not use a mobile phone? How many of you email or  update facebook with your phone?   

 Twenty years ago, when I first ran for Parliament in Tasmania, I was the only  candidate to have a mobile phone  and it took up half my car!   

 It was only in the second half of the 1990s that mobiles and email really took  hold, with Australian early adopters  leading the charge. Our lives have been utterly reshaped by these technologies.  Ten years from infancy to such  ubiquity that we can scarcely remember what it was like before they ruled our  lives!  In 1961 as an eight year old girl, I remember sitting by the wireless on a dairy  farm in north west Tasmania,  listening to President Kennedy promise that, within a decade, America would put  a man on the moon and bring  him home safely.   

 Kennedy said:   

 I believe we possess all the resources and talents necessary. But the facts of the matter  are that we have never made  the national decisions or marshalled the national resources required for such leadership.  We have never specified  long-range goals on an urgent time schedule, or managed our resources and our time so  as to ensure their fulfilment.  But in a very real sense, it will not be one man going to the moon - if we make this  judgment affirmatively, it will be an  entire nation. For all of us must work to put him there.   

 Kennedy didn’t promise to get halfway to the moon, let alone 5 to 25% of the  way there. He didn’t promise to put  a man on the moon if the economic modelling looked okay.   

 Instead he captured the imagination, and drove the creativity and innovative  spirit of not only his own country,  but of a whole generation who came to believe that anything is possible. And,  sure enough, I remember as a 16  year old at boarding school in Hobart watching Neil Armstrong step onto the 

 moon. The belief that anything was  possible was a gift to my generation.   

 Committing to delivering a safe climate means embracing the massive challenge  of moving to zero emissions  fast, frees you up to unleash human creativity in a wave unlike anything we’ve  seen. Just as in 1989 we could  not imagine the world of the iPhone and Blackberry, in the next 20 years we can  and will create something that  now seems impossible.  But, if we fail to do what it takes, we will find out the hard way what that  different world will be. Whether by  deliberately refusing to act or, equally culpably, by recklessly setting our sights  too low, we will shut the door on  opportunity and make only one future possible.   

 Which brings me to the CPRS.   

 While the Greens have been advocating real solutions to climate change, the  Government, since its election,  has been standing in the way. Whether it is forests, a feed-in tariff or targets,  we have simply been told to sign  up to their plan which we know sets its sights so low as to actively lock out the  option of success. The Greens  cannot and will not support a scheme that is environmentally ineffective and  economically inefficient.   

 Supporting the CPRS would mean Australia would have the same greenhouse  gas emissions in 2013 as today  making deep cuts by 2020 much more difficult and expensive than it needs to  be. Rejecting the CPRS gives us  hope that real solutions could be implemented in that time bringing down  emissions far faster and cheaper.  A failure to agree this year is a better outcome than an agreement to fail.   

 But isn’t it better than nothing? I say no.   

 Incrementalism is worse than useless in the face of the climate crisis. Just as  you can’t be a little bit pregnant,  you can’t stop climate change by doing 5% of what is necessary. Or even 25%.  If we trigger tipping points, the  heating process will gather its own momentum and there will be nothing we can  do to stop it. Doing too little to  avoid those tipping points is functionally equivalent to doing nothing.   

 The reason the scheme must not pass in its current form is, ironically, exactly  the reason the Government uses  to say it must be passed — because it will send a signal to Australian industry,  the Australian community and  the global community that cannot be ignored. Yes, it will send a signal, but the  signal will be wrong.  The CPRS says to the rest of the world that, regardless of how much the world  must do to save the climate,  Australia will do as little as we think we can get away with. It is a completely  unacceptable and irresponsible  signal.   

 Which countries does Australia say should do more so that we can do less?   

 The UN climate change secretariat revealed on June 6th that the pledges made  by rich countries total between  16-24% below 1990. This falls well short of what is needed to avoid catastrophic  climate change.   

 A bold global agreement needs a pooling of national sovereignty — all countries  of the world acting in our  common interest, not in their short term, election informed, national interest as  the Howard Government did in  Kyoto and the Rudd Government has delivered for Copenhagen.   

 A bold agreement needs money on the table and an agreement to reform global  governance institutions to  oversee enforcement and compliance, rather than domestic legislation that gives  a Minister the wriggle room to  decide whether target commitments have been triggered.   

 If Australia goes to Copenhagen legislatively constrained from agreeing to a  target higher than the 25%  minimum that the world requires from rich, high-polluting countries, the only  possible impact will be to lower the  level of ambition from other developed countries, giving succour to other  recalcitrants like Canada, Japan and  Russia. This in turn makes it less likely that China, India and other large  developing nations will sign up to a  deal.   

 The CPRS may well have provided Japan with the cover it needed to announce  its 8% target in Bonn. Chinese  negotiators have slammed Australia’s targets and conditions as obnoxious. They  say that, unless countries like 

 Australia and Japan offer targets in the order of 40% by 2020, they will not  accept any kind of binding targets.  Follow the CPRS scenario to its logical conclusion and the chances of agreement  in Copenhagen look very grim  indeed with Australia’s 25% conditional in the flying pig category.   

 The world needs a circuit-breaker — some nation to finally offer what the science  requires, not another  craven compromise.   

 Furthermore, the Greens cannot accept a scheme which is clearly geared  towards protecting the status quo,  sandbagging the old resource based economy when we need transformation.   

 Business needs long-term investment horizons in order to make multi-billion  dollar investments. The CPRS will  provide such an investment horizon, but it will be the wrong one. Evidence  provided to the Senate Climate  Policy Committee by experts from the London Carbon Exchange, the Productivity  Commission’s recent report  and comments from Sir Nicholas Stern all conclude that, if the CPRS is passed in  its current form, Australian  industry and investors will be sent a very strong signal that will drive  inappropriate and misguided investments.  This signal will give business the confidence to invest in ‘low pollution’  infrastructure such as gas power stations  and slightly less dirty coal rather than renewables. Yesterday’s announcement  expanding Eraring coal fired  power station is a case in point.   

 When, in a few years, we come to our senses and decide to target a safe  climate, these assets will be stranded,  dropped as sunk costs and replaced with zero emissions alternatives bought  overseas. That would be a very  stupid and expensive mistake.   

 Professor Garnaut correctly warned that opening the floodgates to rent-seekers  is economically unjustifiable.  Handing out $16 billion in corporate polluter welfare is a grossly unacceptable  transfer of wealth from the  community to the polluters.   

 Some 50% of the scheme’s revenue — or foregone revenue, thanks to free  permits — is earmarked for  shielding polluters from the scheme’s impact, and most of the rest will shield 

 householders from the impact  through the short-sighted mechanism of cash handouts or fuel subsidies instead  of the long-sighted approach of  rolling out energy efficiency upgrades and public transport to reduce costs and  pollution. A mere 3% of the  scheme’s revenue will actually directly help anyone reduce emissions let alone  invest in the technologies that  provide solutions and would revitalise manufacturing here in Australia.   

 Finally, there is the disempowering signal the CPRS would send to the Australian  community.   

 People are angry because they understand that every dollar handed over to the  polluters is a dollar less to  spend on community solutions. By putting a floor under pollution levels, 

 ensuring that Australia’s emissions  cannot fall below that level no matter how hard some of us try, the scheme has  been attacked for undermining  voluntary efforts to reduce emissions, making them helpful only in reducing the  price pressure on polluters.   

 The root cause of that problem, and the only solution, is the target itself. The  5% target sends a signal to give up  in despair, disempowering the whole of Australia, from householders to State  Governments. And if the  Government aims so low but still manages to convince a majority of Australians  that it is doing something  worthwhile, it takes the pressure off everyone to actually do what needs to be  done.  The Government’s plan locks in the nightmare. The Greens’ plan would inspire  the dream.   

 First we need a global target that can deliver a safe climate. We must preserve  the functioning of the planet’s  ecological systems, its biodiversity, without which we cannot survive.   

 To stabilise at 350 ppm in any safe timeframe, Bill Hare of the Potsdam Institute  has calculated that the whole  world economy must be carbon neutral by 2050. That is undeniably a massive  task. Prime Minister Rudd and  Minister Wong say it can’t be done. But, as the ecologist Paul Hawken said  recently:   

 Forget that this task of planet saving is not possible in the time required. Don’t  be put off by people who know 

 what is not possible. Do what needs to be done, and check to see if it was  possible after you are done.”  Last week I visited the Newcastle CSIRO Energy Centre and the University. I saw  technologies ready to be  scaled up and commercialised — technology that will see solar hot water  systems powering air conditioners  and solar thermal towers able to power the whole of Australia from an area as  small as 50 kilometres by 50  kilometres. Technologies that will see solar energy delivered in flexible fabrics  like curtains and awnings. I saw  technologies that can capture energy from the vibrations of bridges and cars,  not to mention capturing energy  from walking to charge mobile phones. I saw work on new community scale wind  turbines, the intelligent grid  and devices that can automatically manage household energy demand, saving  huge amounts of energy and  dollars.   

 We humans are capable of amazing things when we set our minds to it. Setting  a zero emissions safe climate  target would inspire the community and unleash a wave of creativity, of  innovative job creation that is right now  champing at the bit. Just as JFK’s belief that we can do anything was his gift to  my generation, this would be our  gift to generations living now.   

 The political, social and economic make over required is so transformative that it  the creates the opportunity to  go green fields; to identify what we don’t like about our lives and, in moving to  the zero carbon future, fix those  things.   

 This is the silver lining in the storm clouds of the climate crisis.   

 By rethinking what is important to us and the way we live our lives, we will  reshape the spaces we live in and the  way we are governed to build a happier, healthier, safer community.   

 We can overcome our time poverty, our social isolation and loneliness, our  unhealthy sedentary lifestyles, our  disconnection from nature, our sensory overload. We can face the anxiety in the  back of our minds that we are  the first generation to hand on to our children a planet in worse repair than we  have enjoyed.   

 Our wealth has not brought us happiness and governments are now analysing  scientifically demonstrated ways  to improve well-being in everyday life and the policy interventions that would  enable them. They are exactly the  interventions that need to be made to address climate change and peak oil. Last  year, the New Economics  Foundation conducted a study for the UK Government, identifying “five ways to  well-being”: connect, be active,  take notice, keep learning and give.   

 By re-designing our cities around people instead of cars, with green spaces,  cycleways and pedestrian paths,  with rapid transit linking urban villages, we will reinvigorate communities,  reconnect to each other and be more   active in our daily lives.   

 By taking jobs to communities rather than the other way around, we can  increase work flexibility. Instead of  being stuck in traffic for hours, we can spend more time with our family and  friends and in our communities  building supportive and lasting relationships.   

 By growing some of our own food in community gardens, by supporting seasonal  locally grown food and by  relocalising services from health to education we can build community resilience,  health and well being.  By making our homes and offices more energy efficient and making ourselves 

 more aware of the energy we  use, we connect, take notice and learn.   

 By setting ourselves the massive task of reaching carbon neutrality as fast as  possible, we all give — to each  other locally to globally in the spirit of climate justice and the Millennium goals,  and to the generations that will  follow us. As the NEF said, we are “hard wired to enjoy helping one another”!   

 The Greens have concrete proposals to make this transformative vision a reality:  a new politics for a new  century, reengaging the community and restoring trust through transparency,  equity and participation in decision  making from the local to the global.   

 Our policies start and end with a whole of government, systemic approach that  uses every tool at the  government’s disposal in a mutually reinforcing cycle, rather than an internally 

 inconsistent and  counterproductive one. For example, with the recent stimulus package, the  Greens negotiated a $300 million  Local Green Jobs package which has been widely praised for creating jobs while  protecting the environment  and heritage and revitalising communities. This has been so successful that we  will be pressing the Government  to make it part of the Budget every year.   

 While putting a price on carbon is a critical part of reducing emissions, it is far  from the only tool in the toolbox. If  it is to be a useful tool, it has to be well designed. A Greens-designed emissions  trading scheme would lock in  serious emissions targets and cap the use of overseas CDM permits. It would 

 auction all permits and recycle the  revenue into driving emissions reductions through energy efficiency, an  intelligent electricity grid, research,  development and commercialisation of renewables, and rolling out public  transport infrastructure. By  implementing the polluter pays principle, we would raise the resources to build  that vision in Australia.   

 Importantly, we would also use some of the revenue for the urgent task of  training and redeploying the million strong  workforce we will need to make our vision a reality. Far from climate action  being a jobs destroyer, the  lack of trained workers is actually our biggest obstacle — after the lack of  political will. People who work  currently in the sunset industries have skills that we need urgently in the sunrise  industries, and the Greens  would make sure that those communities transitioning from the old, polluting  economy become the first to gain.  Newcastle is a case in point. The Hunter can transform from carbon pollution hub  to the powerhouse of a carbon  neutral Australia.   

 Contrary to the naysayers, the labour market actually has an extraordinary  capacity to handle structural change.  For example, in the decade to November 2007, employment in rural industries  dropped by almost 100,000,  employment in manufacturing dropped by almost 50,000, and employment in  wholesale trade dropped by   

 35,000. Yet, over this period, the unemployment rate fell from 8 and a half  percent to 4%. Similarly, over a 

 million workers employed in February 2005 were no longer with the same  employer a year later, and over half of  these changed industry.   

 The Government must conduct a full jobs audit of Australia — matching the skills  of workers whose jobs are at  risk with the skills we so desperately need, and filling any gaps with targeted job  creation, education and training  initiatives.   

 In addition to the multi-billion dollar direct investment program we could afford  if we auctioned all permits, the  Greens have an array of specific programs which can and should start  immediately, cutting emissions straight  away, regardless of whether or not we can agree on emissions trading this year.   

 The Greens want to see renewable energy providing 40% of our electricity by  2020, driven by a stronger  Renewable Energy Target, supplemented by a gross national feed-in tariff that  would pay a premium rate for all  renewable energy - bold, but achievable on current global growth trajectories  for many renewable energy  technologies.   

 Farming renewable energy would no longer be a dream but a reality for those  farmers desperate to supplement  their income and stay on the farm. Every home and business could become a  mini power station.   

 Our Energy Efficiency Access and Savings Initiative is the boldest policy yet for  retrofitting all 8 million existing  homes across Australia. We are developing new legislation to drive commercial  building efficiency, and at the  industrial scale, we will again move to require the largest energy users to not  only audit their energy use but to  implement the findings of those audits. We would introduce new standards for  appliances and buildings and  vehicles to maximise energy efficiency, and support them with government  procurement.   

 An aggressive energy efficiency rollout together with the RET, would mean we  could begin retiring coal fired  power plants, something that leading Australian climate scientists recently called  for in an open letter to  Australian coal generators. 

 

 Around the world there is a deep and rising concern about biodiversity loss and  the need to give species their  best chance of survival by habitat protection and restoration. The Greens would  protect the carbon stores in our  magnificent forests and native vegetation, creating thousands of jobs in  environmental stewardship in regional  communities, including remote indigenous communities. This would also improve  water supplies and increase  the well being that comes from being able to enjoy the wonder of nature. Feel  Blue, Touch Green.   

 I know this will not be easy.   

 But I also know that, in the face of vested interests, we have the strongest  possible allies — the people!  Politically, the Greens are at a turning point in Australia and globally. The Global  Greens are the only  international political force united around strengthening local communities and  building global citizenship. Our  representation is steadily growing, with big swings in recent European elections  taking us from 35 MEPs to 46 in  a Parliament shrunk by 49 seats. In Australia, we are the third political force,  with 26 State and Federal MPs  — half of them women — and over 100 local government representatives,  numbers that are steadily increasing.   

 Outside politics, the groundswell is even faster. In kitchens, classrooms, offices,  factories, farms, campuses and  communities a powerful people’s movement is burgeoning.   

 Addressing the Climate Summit here in Canberra in January was inspiring —  seeing some 500 people from  140 communities across Australia come together to demand that our democratic  institutions respond to the  climate crisis. Their work continued with rallies in capital cities last weekend.   

 More recently, I became an ambassador for the one million women campaign to  inspire women across Australia  to reduce their emissions. Not since the women’s movement in the 1960s and  ’70s has the call gone out to  women of all ages and all backgrounds to unite around one cause. The Baby  Boomers are retiring and  radicalising again, ready to take up where they left off! Another driver for new  politics. 

 

 In just a few weeks, the wonderful young people from the Australian Youth  Climate Coalition will be holding their  Powershift conference, bringing together more than 1500 to engage in skills-sharing and inspiring discussions  before returning to their communities to drive change. That they can do it is  indisputable. Remember that the  average age of those working on the Moon Mission was 26. They were the space  generation. Old Parties and  Old Polluters beware, here comes the solar generation with a power shift in  Canberra.   

 Philanthropists are opening their purse strings ever wider. Institutional investors  are waiting in the wings.  Scientists and technologists are beavering away across the country, coming up  with brilliant ideas most of which  are yet to be tested because government and industry have not pressed the Go  button.   

 We are standing at an extraordinary moment in history. We must choose the  dream or face the nightmare?  Hope and fear are powerful emotions, one shrinks the space for action the other  amplifies it.  If we try, we may still fail. But if we do not try, we cannot possibly succeed.   

 The Greens intend to try. The community is with us. We intend to make the  difference between what we humans  do now and what we are capable of doing.   

 As Thoreau said:   

 I did not wish to take a cabin passage, but rather to go before the mast and on  the deck of the world, for there I could  best see the moonlight amid the mountains. I do not wish to go below now.
