 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Welcome everyone to Tasmania. There will be obviously a number of campaign events tomorrow and there  will be an opportunity as you’d expect for a full doorstop press conference tomorrow, but I just want to  make a few observations and take a few questions now, because our country has passed a terrible milestone.  We have had today the 50,000th illegal arrival by boat since Mr Rudd changed the border protection policies  that worked.   

 Since Mr Rudd made this terrible failure of judgment. Since Mr Rudd turned out not to be man enough to  leave well enough alone, we’ve had more than 50,000 illegal arrivals, almost 800 illegal boats, $11 billion in  border protection blowouts and tragically, more than a thousand deaths at sea. This has been absolute  disaster for our country and it’s happened because of Mr Rudd’s failure of judgment.   

 The truth is that if you want to put the people smugglers out of business, you’re going to have to change the  government. The man who started the boats coming is not the man to stop the boats. The only way to stop  the boats is to put in place the Coalition’s policies and amongst the Coalition’s key policies are temporary  protection visas to deny the people smugglers a product to sell, rigorous offshore processing at places like  Nauru and Manus, the willingness to turn boats around where it’s safe to do so and the closest possible  cooperation with source and transit countries. Only the Coalition has the will to make this a reality.   

 QUESTION:   

 Immigration Minister Tony Burke says that there is some evidence of the PNG policy being successful. I  understand there’s anecdotal evidence that people smugglers are being asked for the money back that  asylum seekers have given them and there are some people on Papua New Guinea who are we understand  asking to go home. Do you accept that the policy is starting to work?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 A number of observations if I may in response to that question. First, if some people are asking to go home,  that’s obviously a good thing, but that’s happened before and the boats have kept coming. Second, if the

 PNG solution really is working, if everyone really is going to go to PNG, why is it that the Government is  building a new detention centre at Singleton? And third what we learnt today was that Mr Rudd’s statement  a couple of weeks ago about the PNG deal simply isn’t true. Mr Rudd said first, that every illegal arrival by  boat would go to PNG and he said second that no-one who goes to PNG would ever come to Australia and  we now know because we’ve seen the Memorandum of Understanding that Mr Rudd’s statement simply is  not, was not true.   

 QUESTION:   

 Are you being honest with people about the boat numbers because you’ve mentioned a figure of 50,000  here, but that doesn’t just include the asylum seekers who are coming to Australia, it includes the crew. Do  you think it’s fair to use that figure?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well they all come to Australia illegally by boat - they come to Australia illegally by boat and the numbers  that have come to Australia illegally by boat has now passed 50,000. Now just think of that number 50,000.  It’s bigger than Gladstone, it’s bigger than Coffs Harbour. It’s bigger than Shepparton. It’s bigger than  Burnie. It’s bigger than Mount Gambier and it’s bigger than Bunbury where in fact an illegal boat turned up.  So, these are very, very large numbers and they’ve come because Mr Rudd wasn’t man enough to leave well  enough alone.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, can you actually guarantee - I mean any solution such as this PNG solution is going to take a  few weeks to work or do you disagree with that? If you disagree with that, can you guarantee that your  solution would work in a quicker time?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, we’ve seen ebbs and flows when it comes to boat people arrival, but the trend has been inextricably  up. Now, I accept that there’s probably been a slower rate of arrivals in the last ten days or so than in the  previous week, but as I said, we’ve seen ebbs and flows in the arrivals, but the trend has been inextricably  up. The test of border protection policies is do they stop the boats? Now, as we know, the previous Coalition  government had a serious problem back in 2001, but new policies, tough new policies have been put in place  and between 2002 and 2007, we had three boats a year. In recent times under Mr Rudd, we’ve had  something like three boats a day on many days. So look, I accept that it does take time for policies to work,  but you’ve got to have the right policies and the problem with the current Government under Mr Rudd,  under Ms Gillard and now under Mr Rudd again is that no policies have been consistently and rigorously  pursued. That’s why I say the only way to stop the boats is to change the government.   

 QUESTION:   

 Will your policies work within a two week timeframe?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, my policies should there be a change of Government on September 7th will make a difference from  day one, because from day one, the Navy to our north would have new orders and from day one, we would  begin to put in place Operation Sovereign Borders. The people smugglers would know from day one that  Australia was under new management, that Australia had a new will to stop the boats and that the will of the  Australian Government under the Coalition was more than a match for the people smugglers.   

 QUESTION: 

 3 

 

 

 Mr Abbott, how do you quantify that it’s working from day one though? How do you make that judgment?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 The public will know, because they would see the results and the people smugglers would know because  from day one, there would be a new vigour and a new energy in our cooperation with Indonesia. There will  be new orders given to the Navy in the waters to our north and there would be a new vigour and a new  determination when it came to the construction of appropriate facilities at places like Nauru and Manus  Island. We’ve done it before, we’ll do it again. If you want to stop the boats, you’ve got to change the  government. That’s the clear message.   

 Thank you.
