 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP DOORSTOP INTERVIEW AFTER MEETING WITH PREMIER EDMUND STOIBER

 MUNICH, GERMANY

 E&OE………………………………………………………………………………………

 JOURNALIST:

 After  your  talks  with  Mr  Stoiber,  do  you  think  he’s  the  right  man  for  the  job  as Chancellor of Germany?

 PRIME MINISTER:

 I  don’t  express  views  about  the  domestic  politics  of  another  country.  It’s  always important to meet the opposition as well as the Government when you visit a country but the  question  of  who  the  next  Chancellor  should  be  is  entirely  a  matter  for  the German people.

 JOURNALIST:

 Did you discuss his policies as a reformer of the labour market or…[inaudible]

 PRIME MINISTER:

 We talked about a whole lot of things. I explained what Australia had done to strengthen her economy over the last 15 to 20 years and we talked about some of the challenges of economic reform in Europe, but the question of what policies he put forward, indeed the policies  that  Chancellor  Schroeder  put  forward  are  entirely  a  matter  for  the  two gentlemen and it is not for me to make comments about domestic politics in Germany.

 JOURNALIST:

 Was he at all curious about Australia’s asylum seeker policy?

 PRIME MINISTER:

 We talked about that issue. I don’t think he was curious. He understood it and it wasn’t an  issue  of  any  discord  between  us.  Obviously  Europe  is  strengthening  its  cause  in relation to immigration.

 JOURNALIST:

 What about trade reform? Did you get any impression of how he would treat that issue?

 PRIME MINISTER:

 Well I took the opportunity of putting the Australian case very strongly but I think there is  a  sense  that  agricultural  reform  is  difficult  but  there  is  also  a  sense  amongst  many  I speak to that some change in time will come about. But the European Union does move slowly in  relation  to  these things.  I expect  the main  focus  of what  I wish  to  say on  the subject will be in Brussels when I meet the members of the Commission but I certainly have taken the opportunity in everybody I’ve spoken to in both sides of politics here in Germany in putting the Australian case very strongly.

 JOURNALIST:

 Prime Minister you have had a pretty close hand look at the Eurocopter this morning. Do you ever… how do you envisage that being used in Australia once it is delivered? Do you envisage it being used in border protection?

 PRIME MINISTER:

 Well, that never entered my head. I mean the question of how it is used is really a matter for the military. We have made a judgement that it is a very good helicopter. It is very mobile  and  because  of  its  weight  it’s  very  good  in  relation  to  landing  on  vessels  but  I haven’t thought of it in those terms. It’s an attack helicopter - break it down!

 JOURNALIST:

 After three days here, what is the key achievement in your mind:?

 PRIME MINISTER:

 I  think  the  key  achievement  is  that  we  have  established  the  idea  in  the  minds  of  the German leadership that we have a relationship, a very important economic and political relationship, with Germany, separate and apart from the European Union. I think it is a mistake to see all our relations with the major countries of the continent through Brussels. We  have  strong  bilateral  links  with  many  of  them  and  I  see  this  inaugurating  a strengthened  pattern  of  bilateral  relationships  directly  with  Germany  and  not  through Brussels.

 JOURNALIST:

 …to go through Brussels? Why is it a danger?

 PRIME MINISTER:

 Well  I  think  it’s  a  mistake  to  see  you  relations  with  all  the  countries  of  the  European Union simply in the context of the European Union. I think what we have to do, we will get more out of it if we deal directly with individual countries rather than going through the Union because like all supranational bodies it is slow moving and it’s bureaucratic.

 JOURNALIST:

 Mr Howard, these claims that Cheryl Kernot and Gareth Evans had a relationship. Should people have been told at the time of her switch to the Labor Party and do people have a right to know?

 PRIME MINISTER:

 I have absolutely no comment on that matter of any description.

 JOURNALIST:

 Did it change any perceptions of the reasons behind why she switched sides?

 PRIME MINISTER:

 I have no comment on that matter of any description.

 JOURNALIST:

 Just quickly, at home, are you pleased to see there has been no move in interest rates?

 PRIME MINISTER:

 Well  I  don’t  give  day-to-day  comments  on  movements  in  interest  rates.  I  expect  the Reserve  Bank  to  run  a  sensible  monetary  policy  and  that  sensible  monetary  policy includes  a  sensitivity  to  the  sensitivity  of  the  Australian  economy  to  interest  rate adjustments.

 JOURNALIST:

 … your Athens trip and what you hope to achieve there?

 PRIME MINISTER:

 Well I certainly hope to warmly emphasise the very close bilateral relationship. I would hope  that  we  can  agree  on  kick-starting  or  restarting  the  negotiations  over  a  social security agreement. That is very important because there are many Australians of Greek heritage who would see progress on that front as important. But we have put quite a good offer on the table and I hope that the Prime Minister and I, that’s the Prime Minister of Greece and I, can kick-start that.

 JOURNALIST:

 AnD Olympic procurement, do you have any hopes for that?

 PRIME MINISTER:

 Well we had a bit of trouble on that. We tended to be squeezed out. We think that has all been fixed but I will want to be completely satisfied it has been, but I think it has been.

 JOURNALIST:

 Would you agree with Mr Crean’s call for both Ms Kernot and Mr Evans to explain the nature of their relationship?

 PRIME MINISTER:

 I have no comment to make on it of any description.
