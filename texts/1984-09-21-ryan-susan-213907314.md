 IMPORTANT ROLE FOR SCHOOLS IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY

 Schools had the opportunity to provide education which  reflected the changing composition of Australian society and  developed the educational potential offered by a multicultural  society, the Minister for Education and Youth Affairs, Senator  Susan Ryan, said today.

 Senator Ryan was launching the book, 'The Great Immigration  Debate *, In Sydney.

 The book, produced by the Federation of Ethnic Communities'  Councils, provides Information on the history of Immigration  and the contribution of culturally diverse communities to  Australia's development.

 The views of major political parties, senior academics and  representatives of Aboriginal, church, ethnic affairs, employer  and union group are presented In the book. It Includes also a  selection of comments from secondary school students.

 'That section Is particularly pleasing to me, because It Is  today's youth who will be forming the society of tomorrow,'   Senator Ryan said.

 'It Is their view, opinions and suggestions which are most  Important for the shaping of tomorrow's world.'

 Senator Ryan said the Federal Government's education policies  aimed to redress past Imbalances In the opportunities available  to migrants and refugees.

 The Participation and Equity Program, a program to reform  secondary education and make It appropriate for all students,  a  new program to Improve basic skills In primary schools,  and a  quality of education review had all been added to exlsltlng  programs to help remedy disadvantage.

 'The publication of this book, through the initiative taken by  the Federation, Is an indication of community concern to ensure  that unbiased Information is made available to students in our  schools,' Senator Ryan said

 21 September 1984

 SPEECH FOR THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION AND YOUTH AFFAIRS,  

 SENATOR SUSAN RYAN, FOR THE LAUNCHING OF THF GRFAT IMMIGRATION  

 DEBATE IN SYDNEY ON 21 SEPTEMBER 1984

 I WANT TO BEGIN BY COMMENDING THE FEDERATION OF ETHNIC 

 COMMUNITIES' COUNCILS OF AUSTRALIA FOR ITS INITIATIVE IN 

 PRODUCING THIS BOOK, THE GREAT IMMIGRATION DEBATE. WHILE THE 

 TITLE MIGHT SUGGEST DIFFERENCES OF OPINION, THE BOOK REFLECTS A 

 SURPRISING AND HEARTENING CONVERGENCE OF VIEWS REGARDING THE 

 ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION, PARTICULARLY IN THE PRESENT CONTEXT OF 

 PUBLIC DISCUSSION. THIS BOOK IS MOST WELCOME FOR THE 

 REFRESHINGLY OPEN AND FACTUAL WAY IT PRESENTS ITS ARGUMENTS.

 THE BOOK PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE HISTORY OF IMMIGRATION AND 

 THE CONTRIBUTION OF CULTURALLY DIVERSE COMMUNITIES TO 

 AUSTRALIA'S DEVELOPMENT. THIS WILL MAKE IT AN IMPORTANT 

 CONTRIBUTION TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND TO 

 MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION IN AUSTRALIA.

 THE FEDERATION IS TO BE CONGRATULATED FOR THE WIDE RANGE OF 

 CONTRIBUTORS IT HAS INCLUDED IN THE BOOK. WE ARE PRESENTED 

 WITH THE VIEWS OF THE MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES, SENIOR ACADEMICS 

 AND REPRESENTATIVES OF ABORIGINAL, CHURCH, ETHNIC AFFAIRS, 

 EMPLOYER AND UNION GROUPS. THERE IS ALSO AN INTERESTING 

 SELECTION OF COMMENTS BY SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS. THAT

 2

 SECTION IS PARTICULARLY PLEASING TO ME, BECAUSE IT IS TODAY'S 

 YOUTH WHO WILL BE FORMING THE SOCIETY OF TOMORROW. IT IS 

 THEIR VIEWS, OPINIONS AND SUGGESTIONS WHICH ARE MOST IMPORTANT 

 FOR THE SHAPING OF TOMORROW'S WORLD.

 THE GREAT IMMIGRATION DEBATE ALSO INCLUDES AMONG ITS 

 WIDE-RANGING CONTENTS A STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER IN A 

 SPEECH TO PARLIAMENT IN MAY THIS YEAR. LET ME QUOTE FROM THAT 

 SPEECH. MR HAWKE SAID THAT "ONE OF AUSTRALIA'S GREATEST 

 ACHIEVEMENTS HAS BEEN ITS ACCEPTANCE OF PEOPLE FROM WIDELY 

 DIVERSE NATIONALITIES AROUND THE WORLD". "IT IS IMPERATIVE" HE 

 SAID, "THAT OUR DEBATE BE BASED ON A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE 

 FACTS AND THAT THE FACTS BE PRESENTED HONESTLY".

 I BELIEVE THAT THE BOOK WE ARE LAUNCHING TODAY PRESENTS THE 

 FACTS IN A LUCID AND POSITIVE WAY. IT WILL DO MUCH TO FILL AN 

 INFORMATION VACUUM IN THE COMMUNITY GENERALLY AND ESPECIALLY IN 

 OUR SCHOOLS. IT POINTS TO A MULTICULTURAL AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY 

 OFFERING RICH AND VARIED CHOICES OF LIFESTYLES, DIVERSITY IN 

 RELATIONSHIPS AND EXPOSURE TO OTHER VALUES AND POINTS OF VIEW.

 'MULTICULTURALISM' IS MORE THAN A DESCRIPTIVE TERM TO DESIGNATE 

 A SOCIETY MADE UP OF DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS. IT IS AN 

 APPROACH TO POLICY FORMULATION AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION WHICH 

 SEEKS TO PROVIDE FOR EQUALITY OF ACCESS, EQUALITY OF 

 OPPORTUNITY AND MORE EQUAL OUTCOMES.

 3

 THE MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS WILL BE A  

 VITAL, TOLERANT AND PROGRESSIVE COMMUNITY IN WHICH ALL GROUPS,  

 BE THEY OF ABORIGINAL, ENGLISH-SPEAKING OR NON-  

 ENGLISH-SPEAKING BACKGROUND, MAKE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO  

 THE RICHNESS, THE DEPTH AND THE TRADITIONS OF OUR NATION.

 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO A MULTICULTURAL  

 AUSTRALIA. IN A SPEECH TO THE FEDERATION OF ETHNIC COMMUNITIES  

 COUNCILS OF AUSTRALIA SOME MONTHS AGO, THE PRIME MINISTER SAID,

 INTER ALIA: "MY GOVERNMENT BRINGS UNSWERVING AND FUNDAMENTAL â  '  '  '  .  '

 THE ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE PROGRAM, THE MULTICULTURAL  

 EDUCATION PROGRAM AND THE ETHNIC SCHOOLS PROGRAM ARE ALL BEING  

 MAINTAINED. THEY ARE BEING REVIEWED BY THE COMMONWEALTH

 THE COMMISSION'S SPECIAL PURPOSE PROGRAMS. THIS REVIEW IS  

 ESSENTIAL IF THE GOVERNMENT IS TO MANE EFFECTIVE IMPROVEMENTS.  

 IT WILL EVALUATE THE EXTENT TO W H I C H  THESE PROGRAMS ARE M E E TI N G  

 OUR OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE  

 PARENTS AND COMMUNITIES CONCERNED ARE, OR SHOULD BE, CONSULTED  

 ABOUT, AND INVOLVED IN, THE MANAGEMENT OR OVERSEEING OF  

 PROGRAMS.

 IT IS IN SCHOOLS THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE  

 EDUCATION WHICH REFLECTS THE CHANGING COMPOSITION OF AUSTRALIAN  

 SOCIETY AND DEVELOPS THE EDUCATIONAL POTENTIAL OFFERED BY A  

 MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

 ACCEPTANCE OF DIFFERENCES AND APPRECIATION OF CULTURAL VARIETY  

 APPEAR IN THE EXTRACTS FROM STUDENTS' WRITING INCLUDED IN THF 

 GREAT IMMIGRATION D E B A T E . FOR EXAMPLE, MARY, A YEAR 11 STUDENT  

 AT KINGSTON STATE HIGH SCHOOL, QUEENSLAND, HAS THIS TO SAY:

 " . . .  THESE MIGRANTS BRING US KNOWLEDGE AND OFTEN  

 CONTRIBUTE IDEAS TO THE COMMUNITY".

 5

 . LESLEY, A STUDENT IN YEAR 12 AT BALMAIN HIGH SCHOOL, SAYS:

 " I ACCEPT ASIANS AS PART OF MY COMMUNITY. I THINK ASIANS  

 ARE WARM, FRIENDLY PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTING TO TALK TO  

 AND I THINK THEIR CUSTOMS ARE UNUSUAL AND DELIGHTFULLY  

 INTERESTING."

 OF COURSE NOT ALL STUDENTS DISPLAY SUCH POSITIVE ATTITUDES. I  

 MIGHT ALSO QUOTE GRANT, A YEAR 9 STUDENT FROM GREENWOOD,

 WESTERN AUSTRALIA, WHO WOULD NOT WELCOME PEOPLE FROM OTHER  

 COUNTRIES:

 " . . .  UNLESS THEY PROMISE NOT TO SPEAK ANY OTHER LANGUAGE  

 BUT OURS."

 IT IS TO COMBAT JUST SUCH LACK OF UNDERSTANDING THAT THE GREAT  

 IMMIGRATION DEBATE HAS BEEN PRODUCED.

 DESPITE HIS ATTITUDE, GRANT HAS HIT ON A MOST IMPORTANT, IF NOT  

 Î Ï £  MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF LIFE IN A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY -  

 LANGUAGE. I BELIEVE THAT PROVISION B O T H  FOR ACQUISITION OF THE  

 HOST COUNTRY'S LANGUAGE - IN THIS CASE ENGLISH - AND  

 MAINTENANCE OF THE MOTHER TONGUE SHOULD BE PURSUED.

 6

 f i r s t  l a n g u a g e  m a i n t e n a n c e  i s i m p o r t a n t  b e c a u s e  l a n g u a g e  is a n

 INTEGRAL PART OF IDENTITY. I BELIEVE, TOO, THAT LEARNING A 

 SECOND LANGUAGE - WHETHER AS AN INDONESIAN LEARNING ENGLISH OR 

 AN ENGLISH-SPEAKING AUSTRALIAN LEARNING GREEK - INVOLVES 

 BROADENING ONE'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD. AND I THINK THAT 

 AWARENESS OF DIFFERENT PERCEPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS, AS 

 EXPRESSED IN LANGUAGE, CAN LEAD TO ACCEPTANCE AND UNDERSTANDING 

 OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SHARE ONE'S MOTHER TONGUE.

 CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC ENRICHMENT IS ONE ASPECT OF THE 

 BENEFITS OF A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY. WHEN IT COMES TO LANGUAGE 

 NEEDS IN, FOR EXAMPLE, DIPLOMACY, TRADE AND FINANCE, A 

 MULTILINGUAL SOCIETY HAS OBVIOUS STRENGTHS AND RESOURCES ON 

 WHICH TO DRAW.

 YOU WILL BE INTERESTED TO KNOW THAT DATA FROM THE NATIONAL 

 SURVEY OF LANGUAGE LEARNING IN SCHOOLS, WHICH MY DEPARTMENT 

 UNDERTOOK IN 1983, WILL SOON BE AVAILABLE. THIS DATA WILL GIVE 

 THE GOVERNMENT A FIRM BASIS FOR PLANNING LANGUAGE IN SCHOOLS.

 THE GREAT IMMIGRATION D E B A T E , AS I STATED EARLIER, WILL ASSIST 

 IN MEETING AN INFORMATION NEED. IN DETERMINING WHAT IS 

 REQUIRED TO MEET INFORMATION AND OTHER NEEDS IN MULTICULTURAL 

 EDUCATION, THE GOVERNMENT - AND IN PARTICULAR MY DEPARTMENT - 

 NOW HAS THE SERVICES OF THE NATIONAL ADVISORY AND COORDINATING 

 COMMITTEE ON MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION.

 7

 THIS COMMITTEE, CHAIRED BY PROFESSOR JAYASURIYA, HAS 12 MEMBERS 

 DRAWN BROADLY FROM GROUPS INVOLVED IN MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION. 

 ONE OF OUR MEMBERS IS FECCA'S NOMINEE, ANNE EKSTEIN.

 YOU ARE NO DOUBT AWARE THAT THE FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE 

 INCLUDE ADVISING ME ON MAJOR REQUIREMENTS IN IMPLEMENTING 

 MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS AT A NATIONAL LEVEL. IT IS 

 ALSO TASKED WITH IDENTIFYING AREAS OF NEED NOT BEING MET, AND 

 MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ON NEW INITIATIVES IN AREAS SUCH AS THE 

 EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF ETHNIC MINORITIES, LANGUAGE ISSUES, 

 EDUCATION FOR INTERCULTURAL UNDERSTANDING AND THE PROVISION OF 

 A CLEARING HOUSE AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE ON MULTICULTURAL 

 MATTERS.

 I BELIEVE THAT THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE AND THE INITIATIVES TAKEN 

 BY GROUPS SUCH AS THE FEDERATION OF ETHNIC COMMUNITIES 

 COUNCILS, WE CAN BE CONFIDENT THAT MULTICULTURAL PROGRAMS AND 

 ACTIVITIES WILL BE MONITORED AND REVIEWED AND THAT NEEDS WILL 

 BE MET.

 THE PUBLICATION OF THIS BOOK, THROUGH THE INITIATIVE TAKEN BY 

 THE FEDERATION, IS AN INDICATION OF COMMUNITY CONCERN TO ENSURE 

 THAT UNBIASED INFORMATION IS MADE AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS IN OUR

 SCHOOLS.

 8

 I WELCOME THE APPEARANCE IN PRINT OF THF fiRFAT I M M I G R A T I O N  

 Î’ÎÎ’Î‘ÎÎ. I BELIEVE THAT TEACHERS WILL FIND IT A VALUABLE 

 RESOURCE AND I WISH THE BOOK EVERY SUCCESS.
