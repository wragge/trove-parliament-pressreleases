 Bob Brown, Senator for Tasmania   

 Beazley Can be PM - Brown 

 28th Jan 05 

 Beazley Can be PM  -  Brown    

 New Opposition leader Kim Beazley is well placed to be Australia’s  next Prime Minister, Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.    

 “The Howard era’s legacy is a nastier Australia and many swinging  voters would be happy to see it replaced,” Senator Brown said.    

 “Kim Beazley has a good connection with the Australian population.  If Beazley fires on the economy, environment, health and education  over the next three years, Australians will fire Howard at the next  election.    

 “John Howard has failed the environment and hitched himself too  closely to George W Bush. This leaves an experienced Kim Beazley  with enormous potential to overtake the Coalition, especially if  economic times get harsher.    

 “The Opposition leader could start by taking a leaf out of Tony  Blair's book and tackling George Bush directly on climate change  and the Kyoto Protocol.  Mr Beazley should put the reduction of  greenhouse gases at the front and centre of Labor's vision for there  is no greater threat to global welfare.    

 “The backing of John Howard's anti-humanitarian refugee policy  that was a feature of the 2001 election campaign should not be  repeated,” Senator Brown advised.
