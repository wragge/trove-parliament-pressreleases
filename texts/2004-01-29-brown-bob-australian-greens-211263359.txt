 Latham Speech 'Oxygen': Brown   

 Mark Latham's speech to the ALP national conference was a breath of oxygen for  Australian big party politics and will excite an electorate jaded with the Howard years,  Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.   

 "While reference to 'slackers' had a tinge of right wing rhetoric which will need collaring,  the speech will appeal to Australians concerned about Medicare, maternity leave, pre-schooling and everyone's right to tertiary education," Senator Brown said.   

 "The Greens are jointly sponsoring a bill to ratify the Kyoto Protocol with Labor in the  Senate next month.     

 "But we want Labor to go much further in fostering Australia's role in renewable energy  and pollution control technology, business and jobs.   

 "It's great that Mark Latham is coming to see Tasmania's iconic forests but the Labor  Party itself needs to part company with John Howard's pro-chainsaw attitude.   

 "Mark Latham is echoing Greens policy - and so gets our endorsement for restoring the  Industrial Relations Commission's role, reversing the HECS hikes (we would abolish  HECS), and a series of plebiscites for the republic (as argued for by Senator Brown in the  1999).   

 "But we would take men and women refugees - as well as children - out of Mr Howard's  razor wire camps.   

 "It was good to hear Mark saying we are nobody's deputy sheriff - that's exactly what I  told President Bush, face to face in parliament last year.   

 "There is a fresh vigour in the Latham speech which compares more than well with Mr  Howard's use of fear and teacher bashing as electoral weapons but he squibbed the  unqualified need to get behind public education which has lost out so much to the private 

 system lately," Senator Brown said.
