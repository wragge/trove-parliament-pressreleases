 LINDSAY TANNER  Minister for Finance & Deregulation 

 

 Media Release 

 12/2008  17 April 2008 

 African Community 2020 Summit  

 Federal Member for Melbourne and Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Lindsay Tanner  is hosting a summit in Melbourne today focusing on the major economic and social issues  facing members of the African community in Australia. 

 The African Community Summit is one of the many local summits that will feed into the  Australia 2020 Summit this weekend to ensure that the ideas of constituents from around  Australia are considered. 

 The African Community Summit will comprise various African Community groups and  associations including organisations that represent refugees from Sudan, Somalia,  Ethiopia and Eritrea. 

 Mr Tanner said: “Upon arrival in Australia, many African migrants face enormous  challenges settling in Australia. Some African refugees with professional qualifications and  good English language skills are still finding it difficult to get work in their chosen  occupations, even when highly qualified.”  

 “This summit is intended to be an open conversation engaging representatives from the  various African community groups in Melbourne. The objective of today’s discussion is to  understand the challenges they face and to draw on their passion and ideas about their  adopted country.” 

 The first session of the African Community Summit will cover issues around social  inclusion such as family reunion, community relations, access to facilities, issues for young  people and housing. The second part of the event will examine the economic issues,  including employment, education, pathways to employment, English language skills and  recognition of qualifications. 

 Mr Paris Aristotle, Director, Foundation for the Survivors of Torture, will chair the event.  The Victorian Foundation for Survivors of Torture (VFST), or ‘Foundation House’ as it is  more commonly known, provides a range of services to refugees who have survived  torture or war related trauma. 

 Mr Tanner, together with Mr Aristotle, will discuss the challenges and issues with more  than 50 participants from the various African community groups that live in Melbourne, as  well as representatives from groups and associations that work closely to provide support  to the African Community.  

 Consideration of issues and ideas at the African Community Summit forms part of the  wider community consultation process feeding into the Australia 2020 Summit in Canberra  on 19 and 20 April.
