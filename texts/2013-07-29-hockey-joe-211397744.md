 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, it is terrific to be here at Suttons Arncliffe. I want to thank Garth Butler and the team here for making  the Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey, our candidate for Barton Nick Varvaris, the Mayor of Kogarah so  welcome.    

 The motor industry has had yet another kick in the guts because Kevin Rudd just does not understand how to  govern. Just does not understand how to govern. You ask yourself what has actually changed in our country  over the last month since Kevin Rudd became Prime Minister. The boats are still coming in record numbers,  the carbon tax is still in place, the faceless men are still running the Labor Party, hundreds of jobs have been  lost in automotive leasing, thousands of orders for new cars have been cancelled, hundreds of millions of  dollars in wealth has been destroyed, all because Mr Rudd is incapable of proper process when it comes to  governing this country.    

 The decision to change the fringe benefits tax on car leases will hit hundreds of thousands of ordinary  Australians by $1,400 a year in extra tax, that’s a $1,400 a year slug on nurses, on charity workers, on sales  reps they just don’t deserve this hit, this kick in the guts from Mr Rudd but it is typical of the sort of thing  that we will see again and again and again from Mr Rudd for as long as he is Prime Minister. This decision  was made with no consultation whatsoever. Without any real understanding of the way the motor industry  works and typically of Mr Rudd because this is a tax which is going to destroy economic activity it is more  likely to end up costing money not raising revenue.   

 So, look if Mr Rudd has managed to do so much damage in just three weeks how much damage do you think  he will do if he gets another three years. Mr Rudd has not changed, the Labor Party has not changed. This is  another mining tax moment from Mr Rudd and the current government.    

 Just a couple of other subjects that I would like to touch on before asking Joe to say a few words. Mr Rudd  is running away from an election. Plainly the government was getting ready to have an election on August  31st but late last week there was a huge argument inside the Cabinet about economic policy. This is a  government in panic over the state of the Budget. They just don’t understand the importance of living within 

 2 

 

 your means and that is why Mr Rudd is now running away from an election on the 31st of August. Even on  the 31st of August an election would be one week overdue. Now, Mr Rudd wants more time, more time for  himself, he is playing games with the Australian people, the Australian people want to regain control over  the government and the prime ministership. Three years is up Mr Rudd, call the election, stop running away  from the public, stop thinking about yourself, start to appreciate that it is time for a bit of democracy in this  country and that means having an election.   

 Finally on the crisis on our borders, look everyone now supports offshore processing, it is just a pity that it  has taken Mr Rudd five years to come to this position. Almost 50,000 illegal arrivals by boat, almost 800  illegal boats, tragically 1,000 deaths at sea, $10 billion in border protection blow-outs and Mr Rudd says he  supports offshore processing in PNG but you know since he made his announcement there have been more  than 1,300 illegal arrivals by boat. That is four times the capacity of the Manus Island processing centre and  not a single person, not one, has yet gone to Manus Island under Mr Rudd’s PNG solution. So, he is just not  fair dinkum and that is why in any contest of wills between Mr Rudd and the people smugglers, the people  smugglers think they will win.    

 So, I want to say again the Coalition is totally committed to giving the motor industry a fair go. We don’t  want to make it harder for the Australian motor industry, we don’t want to make it harder for the Australian  motor sector. These are tough times generally because there is a lot of uncertainty in our economy,  uncertainty over the election date means that investment decisions, employment decisions and spending  decisions don’t get made. That would have a big impact on the car industry at the best of times but these  aren’t the best of times because of Mr Rudd’s latest kick in the guts. I want to make it crystal clear as far as  the Coalition is concerned we will oppose this in opposition and we would never do it in government  because we just don’t believe in the kind of policy on the run which is typical of Mr Rudd.   

 So, Joe over to you.   

 JOE HOCKEY:   

 Well, thanks very much Tony. Quite clearly as Tony said the government is in absolute panic about the state  of the Budget otherwise they would be going to the polls as they were clearly planning for the end of August  and when the Government panics about the Budget you can see the impact. This FBT decision has cost jobs,  it has cost wealth, it has cost families and it has cost these people who are most vulnerable in the community  who are working in charities, who are working in the hospital system who have $35,000 - $40,000 cars as  part of their employment package and at the end of the day when the Government panics about economic  policy it makes its typical bad decisions. We have seen it on the mining tax, we have seen it in the carbon  tax now we are seeing it on FBT and it goes on.   

 If reports are true and there is a $20 to $30 billion hole in the Budget then this Government is going to put in  place some reckless announcements over the next few weeks that undoubtedly will hurt every day  Australians.   

 Frankly, we want to get on with the job of giving the Australian people the right to choose their government  and the right to choose their prime minister. You will never get stability under Labor, you will never get  consultation under Labor. You will only ever get panic and you certainly when it comes to the Budget will  not get the truth. We want the truth in relation to the Budget, I fully expect that we are not going to get it but  we are going to get more panicked decisions under Labor.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Okay, do we have any questions?   

 QUESTION:   

 3 

 

 Just in relation to the PNG policy the Opposition now say it would continue that policy if in government,  why would you now implement it yourselves?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, it was John Howard’s policy to have offshore processing at PNG and this Government said back in  late 2011 that they would have processing in PNG but in two years they have only developed the capacity  for 300 people. So, this is really yet another example of the fact that this Government is all announcement  and no delivery. It is all talk and no action because in two years they have just got a capacity for 300 people  at Manus Island and in more than a week since they made their announcement while 1,300 illegal arrivals by  boat have taken place not a single one of them has yet been sent to PNG which is why no one can take Mr  Rudd seriously on this.   

 QUESTION:   

 So, if you adopt the practice of settling genuine refugees in PNG would that remove the need for temporary  protection visas for people in Australia?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Absolutely not, in the end we are not going to solve Australia’s problems by relying wholly and solely on  other countries. In the end it is going to be decisions and policy changes here in Australia that are going to  protect our borders. No one will ever be more committed to the welfare of this country than this country and  its government. That is why it is a big mistake for Mr Rudd and for the Labor Party to constantly rely on  other countries to solve this problem for us. First of all it was East Timor, then it was Malaysia, then it was  Nauru, now it is PNG. Other countries can help and the Coalition has always wanted to make the most of the  good officers and the help of our friends in the region but in the end we have got to solve this with our  policies here in Australia. That is why yes there will be rigorous processing in PNG and Nauru and  elsewhere but there has got to be temporary protection visas, there has got to be much better relations with  Indonesia and there has got to be the willingness to turn boats around where it is safe to do so.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott  the new Galaxy Poll shows some very positive signs for Labor, that doesn’t make you nervous  as you call on Labor to call an election sooner rather than later?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, if I was nervous I wouldn’t be calling on Labor to put this to the people. I trust the judgment of the  Australian people and I think after three years of minority government, after three years of a hung  parliament, after three years of the faceless men determining who the prime minister of this country is and  the so-called independents deciding who the prime minister of this country should be after Mr Thomson and  Mr Slipper have been critical in deciding who the prime minister of this country should be, let’s put it in the  hands if the people. The people’s choice can’t come soon enough for our country. Let the people decide.   

 QUESTION:   

 So, the Coalition can win the election?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Oh absolutely we can win but it won’t be easy. It is never easy to win from Opposition. I have always said  that winning an election from Opposition is like climbing Mt Everest and look we are not far from the  summit but it is still a long hard climb.

 QUESTION:   

 What did you think of Mr Rudd taking Therese with him on his recent trip to Afghanistan?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, that’s a matter for him. I think he is perfectly entitled to go to Afghanistan and who is included in the  party is really a matter for him. I support Prime Ministers visiting our forces overseas and certainly if there  is a change of government I would want to show my support for our forces overseas at an early opportunity.  Over the last three years I have had three visits myself to Afghanistan and I think it is a very, very good  practice.   

 QUESTION:   

 A state parliamentary committee has found that states could pass the same sex marriage laws. Do you think  it is appropriate for the state to do that rather than it happen at a Federal level?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look what the states do is a matter for the states. The Constitution provides that marriage is a responsibility  of the Commonwealth Parliament and as you know the Commonwealth Parliament recently voted on this  subject and by a fairly decisive margin decided to stick with the existing marriage act   

 QUESTION:   

 What are your thoughts on Mr Rudd’s draft proposal to make it harder for young people to get on the dole?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I am going to get Joe to add to this but this is not even a thought bubble, it is not even a thought  bubble. Labor is allegedly mulling over something - this from the party that almost destroyed work for the  dole. So, really this is more pretense, more deceit, more political posturing from a government which is very  hard to take seriously. Joe?   

 JOE HOCKEY:   

 Look, it is just reported as a thought bubble, as a mull. I mean it is nothing more than a mull. You can’t even  smoke a mull apparently. I mean it’s just complete baloney from Labor and if thought bubbles from the  Labor Party today are being reported as something that’s credible than I would suggest that we need  something more substantial and the Coalition offer that - more than $300 million for a Green Army that is  going to actually employ young people and get them out there and give them the opportunities to start to  learn how to work. You have to put real effort, put real money behind it. So, we have got a real policy on  workforce participation and the Labor Party has got a mull.   

 QUESTION:   

 Sorry, just another question, do you regret questioning the independence of Treasury?   

 JOE HOCKEY:   

 Well, no, I do not apologise in any way for being critical of the forecasts that are being made and the  forecasts that have failed and they are the Government’s forecasts. It is Labor that is bullying the Treasury  and it is Labor that is putting out figures every day that are just wrong and that is undermining business and 

 5 

 

 consumer confidence. You can’t keep getting the numbers wrong every single time and expect to be  respected for your output. Now, the fact is on FBT alone the Government went out there and said that the  people that were driving around in these cars, driving Mercedes and BMW and Maseratis in fact that  represents five per cent of sales. Most of them are driving Holden’s and Toyotas, Mitsubishis and most of  them 75 per cent are earning less than $100,000 a year. Now, what is most alarming is that the Treasury rang  up the salary packaging businesses two to three days after the announcement by the Government to find out  how the scheme works. You don’t find out about these things after the event. You find out before and it just  clearly illustrates the Government doesn’t know what the impacts are of its decisions and its failure to  consult is costing Australians jobs.   

 QUESTION:   

 Just a last, final question for Mr Abbott. If the Government was in caretaker mode when the G20 was on,  would you go along with Mr Rudd?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I have always said that you should campaign for the prime ministership of this country in this country.  The Australian elections are not about someone being prime minister of the world. They are about someone  being the prime minister of Australia and that is why I think that my place between now and polling day is  in Australia. What Mr Rudd does as the Prime Minister is entirely his call but I certainly think that I should  be here in Australia between now and the election amongst other things to protect a great industry like this  from the depredations of the current Government.    

 I really want to close on this note. The motor industry is a great Australian industry. It directly and indirectly  employs hundreds of thousands of people. Holden and Toyota and Ford at the manufacturing level are a very  important part of the industry but then there is a vast industry beyond manufacturing itself in the sales, in the  service, in the financial services associated with the motor industry, in the after parts and so on sector. What  I want to do is make it easier for this industry to flourish. I want to make it easier for people to get on with  their lives and to enjoy driving great motor cars, particularly great Australian made motor cars. That is why  we will abolish the carbon tax, that is why we will cut red tape, that is why we will make it easier to employ  people, that is why we will never go ahead with the kind of knee jerk, policy on the run Budget panic  decision making that we have seen from this Government over the last few days which is a jobs destroyer,  it’s a sales destroyer, it is a wealth destroyer, it is an investment destroyer. We just don’t need this kind of  bad government if we are going to have the kind of industries, the kind of prosperity, the kind of future that  a great country like this and a good industry like this deserves to have.   

 Thank you.
