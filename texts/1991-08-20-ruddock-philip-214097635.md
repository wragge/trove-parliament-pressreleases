 EASTERN EUROPE:  POSSIBLE REFUGEE CLAIMS

 With Glasnost and Perestroika, there was an expectation that genuine  refugees from Eastern Europe would be few in number.

 Planning proceeded on the basis that with new freedom to travel, illegal  immigration made up of so-called economic refugees would be of major  proportions. Suggestions of up to half a million possible claimants were seen 

 as not being unrealistic.

 Given the overthrow of Mikhail Gorbachev, orchestrated by hard liners in  the Communist party, the Soviet military and the KGB, repression is likely  to be the real and immediate outcome.

 Those who have supported nationalist movements in various republics are  possible targets.

 It is hard to believe that there will not be attempts to round up opponents  and potential advocates of alternative points of view.

 An exodus of those who will be able to sustain genuine claims for protection  is now most likely.

 The grievous error of allowing specious claims for refugee status here in  Australia to grow to unmanageable proportions, has put at risk our capacity  to offer the genuine refugee claimants protection from harsh and oppressive  regimes.

 As we have moved quickly in the past to offer protection to those visiting  Australia from the Lebanon, Sri Lanka and now Yugoslavia, prompt action  to allow Soviet citizens temporary protection during this period of  uncertainty is essential.
