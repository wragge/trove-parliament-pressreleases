 ASSISTANCE TO PALESTINIAN REFUGEES

 The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Senator the H o n .  Dame .  

 Margaret Guilfoyle,  today announced a contribution of $A100,000 

 to the appeal which has been launched by the United Nations 

 Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East 

 (UNRWA).  The Acting Minister said that some hundreds of thousands 

 of civilians,  many of them Palestinian refugees,  had been 

 displaced by military action in Lebanon, and that the UNWRA appeal 

 had been established to provide emergency aid to these refugees in 

 the form of food, shelter and medical supplies.

 The Acting Minister noted that the contribution of $A100,000 was 

 in addition to the annual contribution of $A870,000, which Australia 

 makes t’ o the regular budget of UNRWA.  Australia has also contributed 

 $A300,000 to emergency appeals launched by UNDRO and ICRC to aid the 

 victims of the fighting in Lebanon.

 The Acting Minister said that Australia's contribution to the UNRWA—  

 appeal underlined the Government's concern to alleviate the suffering 

 of the victims of the fighting in Lebanon and its conviction that a 

 solution to the-Palestinian question was central to a lasting 

 settlement in the Middle East. .
