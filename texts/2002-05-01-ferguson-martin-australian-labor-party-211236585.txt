 ANDERSON MUST COME CLEAN ON FUDGING SENATE ANSWERS

 The  Minister  for  Transport,  John  Anderson  must  come  clean  on  why  he  tried  to mislead the Australian public on the Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s role in the loss of over 350 lives in the sinking of a vessel carrying asylum seekers to Australia on 19 October last year.

 In  evidence  provided  by  AMSA  to  the  Senate  Inquiry  into  “A  Certain  Maritime Incident”, it became clear that AMSA knew a lot more than the Minister let on in his answer.

 The Senate Estimates question and answer was as follows:

 Senator O’Brien asked:

 “Did AMSA have any role, receive any information or provide any assistance or advice in relation to the refugee boat that sank on 19 October last year?  I want to know whether you received any distress information or calls, or had any knowledge of the boat being in difficulty and what response, if any, AMSA took.”

 Answer:

 AMSA records show that it did not.”

 In the evidence presented today, it is crystal clear that AMSA did receive information from  Coastwatch  that  the  vessel  was  overdue  and  passed  the  information  to  the Indonesian  rescue  authority,  BASARNAS.   AMSA  received  no  response  from BASARNAS and took no further action.

 Tragically, the vessel subsequently sank, killing hundreds of people.

 Was the answer from the Minister for Transport, John Anderson an attempt to avoid scrutiny of AMSA’s role in this incident?

 The Minister must urgently come clean about AMSA’s role in this incident and why he provided a misleading answer to the Senate.
