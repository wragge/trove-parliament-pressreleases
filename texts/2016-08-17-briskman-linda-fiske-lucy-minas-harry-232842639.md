 Over 1,810 Academics across Australia Call for National  Summit on a Just and Humane Approach for Refugees 

 

 Over 1,810 academics from universities across Australia have signed an Open Letter to  Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and to all Members of Parliament calling for a just and  humane approach for refugees. This includes distinguished experts in refugee law, policy,  health and politics. 

 The Open Letter calls on the Australian government to end its harmful policies of offshore  processing, boat turnbacks and the mandatory detention of people seeking asylum. It sets  out detailed practical and sound measures that Australia should adopt as an alternative  policy that would provide people seeking asylum with access to safety and protection.  These measures include: 

 On a national level: 

 ï· closing immigration detention centres and ending mandatory detention;  ï· initiating comprehensive law reform to ensure that Australia upholds its international  obligations;  ï· promoting a decent livelihood and thriving communities for people seeking asylum or 

 people who have been granted Australia’s protection; and  ï· fostering positive and empathetic narratives about people seeking asylum. 

 On a regional and international level: 

 ï· working with states in the Asia Pacific region to create a regional framework based  on equity, capacity and responsibility; and  ï· contributing towards making the international system more sustainable, equitable and  humane. 

 Significantly, the Open Letter calls on the Australian government to convene a National  Policy Summit. The Summit will provide a key political moment for moving beyond the  current damaging paradigm of deterrence in Australian refugee politics. The Summit should  bring together asylum seekers, refugees and former refugees; migrant and refugee  advocates; policy experts; community representatives; and politicians from all parties. It will  provide a space for listening to the voices and expertise of those most affected by the  Australia’s policies to date - asylum seeker and refugees - in order to create a new  consensus for a just and humane approach. 

 Professor Louise Newman AM, an expert on the impact of immigration detention on child  asylum seekers at the University of Melbourne, said that “There is an urgent need for a  national conversation to endorse a new way for treating people seeking asylum in Australia.  We need comprehensive law reform. For example, there is a need to discuss the Border  Force Act with respect to duty of care and ethical obligations of doctors and clinicians. We  also must act urgently to protect women and children from sexual assault and harm.”

 Another expert on the mandatory detention of asylum seekers, Professor Linda Briskman,  Swinburne University, said that “Presenting practical humane measures, the paper seeks to  overcome policies and practices that cause serious harm to both asylum seekers and the  reputation of Australia. Years of rigorous research by contributors from a range of academic  disciplines informs the recommendations.” 

 The Open Letter was written in support of a set of recommendations from a Policy Paper  written by several scholars across various disciplines from Australian universities and  coordinated by a research network, Academics for Refugees. 

 The Open Letter with the list of signatories and Policy Paper are attached and available at  https://academicsforrefugees.wordpress.com.

 Executive Summary Australia must end its harmful policies of offshore  processing, boat turnbacks and the mandatory  detention of people seeking asylum. These policies  have failed and cannot be maintained. A framework  of deterrence has not and does not ‘save lives’.  It has not addressed the underlying reasons why  people embark on dangerous journeys in search  of refuge, nor has it contributed to improving the  global humanitarian situation. Rather, it has created  serious and increasingly intractable new problems,  by attempting to shift responsibilities elsewhere, and  created prolonged suffering for individuals seeking  asylum.

 This Policy Paper sets out practical and sound  measures to be considered by the Australian  government in order to adopt a just and humane  approach towards people seeking asylum in Australia.  Such an approach recognises that it is lawful to seek  asylum and that people should not be penalised  for how they arrive in Australia. It should adopt the  following four measures:

 â¢	close	immigration	detention	centres	and	end	 mandatory detention;

 â¢	initiate	comprehensive	law	reform	to	ensure	 Australia upholds its international obligations;

 â¢	promote	a	decent	livelihood	and	thriving	 communities for people seeking asylum or who  have been granted Australia’s protection; and

 â¢	foster	positive	empathetic	narratives	about	people	 seeking asylum. 

 Australia should work with other countries in the Asia  Paciï¿½èc	region	to	create	a	new	regional	approach	 based on equity, capacity, responsibility and solidarity.  Australia should contribute towards making the  international system more sustainable, equitable and  humane. 

 Australia should convene a National Policy Summit  in 2017. The Summit should bring together  asylum seekers and refugees, migrant and refugee  advocates, policy experts, community representatives  and politicians from all parties. The Summit should  aim to:

 â¢	generate	constructive	policy	options	and	pathways	 for people seeking asylum and refugees that  recognise the need for people to seek a life of  safety; 

 â¢	recognise	and	facilitate	the	positive	contributions	of	 refugees to Australia’s communities; 

 â¢	recognise	Australia’s	responsibility	to	provide	 material support for asylum seekers and refugees; 

 â¢	respect	Australia’s	international	obligations;	

 â¢	reï¿½èect	a	respectful	relationship	between	Australia	 and its regional neighbours; and

 â¢	recognise	Australia’s	potential	for	leadership	on	this	 issue.

 1. Introduction

 This Policy Paper sets out key measures that  Australia can take to adopt a just and humane  approach towards people seeking asylum. It focuses  on Australian, regional and international measures,  drawing on robust evidence-based research.

 2. Australia’s Current   Policies are Harmful There is now conclusive evidence to demonstrate  that Australia’s policies of offshore processing and the  mandatory detention of people seeking asylum are  harmful and have had serious consequences. 

 The policy of mandatorily detaining people  seeking asylum is cruel towards those seeking  asylum. Studies have long shown that prolonged  periods in immigration detention have severe impacts  on the psychological well-being, inter-personal  relationships and quality of life of individuals.1 They  can cause ongoing developmental harm for children  and adults.2		Such	policies	make	it	more	difï¿½ècult	 for individuals to rebuild their lives once granted  protection. The average time spent in onshore  immigration detention was a staggering 459 days   in May 2016.3 

 Processing people seeking asylum in oï¿½èshore  camps has exacerbated these harmful eï¿½èects.   The UN has described these arrangements as deeply  damaging and untenable. The large majority of  people who come to Australia by boat to seek asylum  actually	meet	the	legal	deï¿½ènition	of	a	refugee	set	 out in the UN Refugee Convention. This means that  Australia detains people who have experienced, or  have a reasonable fear of, persecution in their country.  Many have experienced torture or trauma.

 Australia’s current offshore processing arrangements  are in breach of international standards, including the  prohibition against torture and cruel, inhuman or  degrading treatment.5  Such offshore processing is  driving people to take desperate measures: between  September 2012 and April 2015, there were at least  253 incidents of self-harm in the Nauru camp alone.6   These distressing events are often witnessed by  other people, including children, who are particularly  vulnerable in traumatising environments. There have  also been disturbing instances of sexual assault  of women in Nauru and physical abuse of people  seeking asylum. Cases of women who are pregnant  as a result of sexual assault highlight the lack of safety  and protection for women and girls.7 There are also  signiï¿½ècant	concerns	about	the	provision	of	health	and	 mental health care in offshore camps. People have  died as a result of delays in treatment and inadequate  local medical facilities. 

 Additionally, Australia has routinely denied people  seeking asylum who are on bridging visas the right  to work to sustain themselves and to adequate  healthcare — producing enforced poverty and  dependency. This has resulted in people seeking  asylum having limited and unequal access to their  basic social and economic rights. It also makes it  harder for people to re-establish their lives in the  Australian community.

 As of May 2016, there were 1570 people in  immigration detention in Australia and another  1,313 people being held in Australian-funded  camps on Nauru and PNG. A further 341 adults  and 317 children are in community detention on  the Australian mainland. There are also 28,328  people living in the community on a Bridging  Visa E.4

 3. The Need for a New Approach Australia has a duty to provide people seeking  asylum with the right to have their claims assessed in  a fair and	efficient	manner	and	with	access	to	 pathways	to permanent protection. It should adopt  policies that facilitate, not impede, access to safety  and offer genuine opportunities to people to rebuild  sustainable decent lives for themselves and their  families.  

 The binary choice between either adopting policies  that result in people ‘drowning at sea’ or adopting  policies of offshore processing that ‘stop the boats’  and ‘save lives’ is a false one. 

 Australia’s current policies do not ‘save lives’ and  merely put people in danger elsewhere. These  policies fail to address the global humanitarian  situation in which people lack access to safe  pathways to protection or durable solutions. This  means that people may still be compelled to  undertake dangerous journeys in search of safety or  remain in places of persecution, transit, insecurity or  conflict.	

 Australia’s policies have not stopped people from  attempting to travel to Australia by boat to seek  asylum. The policy of ‘boat turnbacks’ has the effect  of returning people to places where they may face  great harm.

 Sound policy alternatives move beyond this false  binary choice. These policy alternatives take  humanitarian and political considerations seriously.   People in search of refuge need better and safer  options so that they do not need to risk their lives and  embark on dangerous journeys. Australia can adopt  regional and global measures, set out below, that  provide protection to people seeking asylum and  prevent them from having to risk their lives at sea.

 Australia’s current regime is costly. Currently, the  Australian government spends over $3.3 billion per  year on immigration detention, including $1.2 billion  to fund the offshore processing camps in Nauru  and Papua New Guinea in 2015.8  Estimates show  that it is 10 times more costly to hold a person in  immigration detention than to allow them to live in the  community while their claims are being processed.9  

 Australia’s current regime has legal  consequences. Australia risks breaching its legal  duty of care towards people in immigration detention  and detaining people in contravention of domestic  and international law. Further legal complaints and  claims for compensation can be expected, costing  billions of dollars,10 especially following the decision of  the PNG Supreme Court that ruled the Manus Island  detention centre to be illegal. 

 ‘We have been here for 3 years. We have  survived the conditions in detention. … Being  detained on Manus for so long is psychological  torture. If there were safer ways for us to seek  safety, we would have done it. We need freedom  to live like other normal human beings. We need  certainty for our future. We kindly ask to be  resettled in Australia so we can work hard and  contribute to the society, and ï¿½ènally live in peace.  We have nowhere else to go and we cannot  return to Sri Lanka.’

 We recommend the following urgent legislative 

 reforms:

 1. Repeal all legislation giving effect to the excision of Australian territory from Australia’s migration zone.

 2. Repeal the legislative category of ‘unauthorised maritime arrival’ and permit persons arriving by sea as unlawful non-citizens to be processed under the existing protection visa regime established for lawful non-citizens.

 3. Repeal the Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) (Class XD) and the Safe Haven Enterprise Visas (SHEV) so that people seeking asylum who are found to be in need of protection are provided with permanent visas, a pathway to citizenship and the right to family reunion.

 4. Cease the practices of ‘boat turnbacks’ and of ‘enhanced screening’ of asylum seekers at sea to ensure full compliance with Australia’s duty of non-refoulement under the UN Refugee Convention.

 4. Australian Measures i. Close Detention Centres and End Mandatory Detention

 As an initial measure, Australia must close its offshore  processing centres on Nauru and Manus Island. 

 Australia should move to replace its harmful  policy of onshore mandatory detention of people  seeking asylum with alternatives to detention. Such  alternatives should include a range of accommodation  options (including community housing and open  facilities) for asylum seekers while their applications  for protection are assessed. Such arrangements allow  people seeking asylum to access services and build  support networks. Alternatives to detention, when  implemented well, are much less damaging to the  people who are seeking asylum and allow them to  re-establish their lives with support and dignity.  They are also demonstrably cheaper than prison-like detention facilities.  

 ii. Initiate Law Reform

 In laying the groundwork for a just and humane  approach to people seeking asylum in Australia,  several aspects of existing law and policy should be  immediately repealed or reformed. In the initial stages  of implementation, these reforms will take time and  resources to enact sound policy and legislation.  In the long-term, these reforms will create a more  economical,	efï¿½ècient	and	just	foundation	for	the	 reception and processing of people seeking asylum in  Australia.

 Each of the proposed reforms leads toward the  broader policy goal of removing policies that  discriminate between people seeking asylum on the  basis of the way they arrive and their legal status  when they arrive in Australia. These reforms seek to  ensure that asylum seekers are not punished on the  basis of their mode of arrival, in breach of Article 31 of  the UN Refugee Convention. 

 “Dear bird send my message.

 Send an image of my eyes - to Abbott -where tears are rolling like a river,

 send my heart full of sorrow,

 send my mind full of thoughts,

 send him images of why I came. “

 iv. Foster Positive and Empathetic Narratives about People Seeking Asylum

 Studies	have	shown	that	public	narratives	inï¿½èuence	 community perceptions and reactions to people  seeking asylum.14 As long as the narrative around  asylum seeking remains fear-based and negative,  then	there	appears	an	apparent	justiï¿½ècation	for	 unnecessarily	tough	policies	that	continue	to	inï¿½èict	 violence and cause harm to people seeking asylum  and safety. 

 Fresh narratives are needed that emphasise the  following principles: 

 â¢ It is lawful to seek asylum. The right to seek asylum is a fundamental human right and states have an obligation to facilitate refugees with access to protection and safety. Under international law, people seeking asylum should not be penalised for how they arrive in a country.

 â¢ Australia	has	been	positively transformed and enriched through the contributions of people from refugee backgrounds: economically, culturally and socially. Encouraging migration and cultural diversity should be seen as an opportunity for celebrating our shared existence and diverse heritages.

 â¢ Seeking	asylum	should	be	framed	as	an	issue	of human rights and justice, and not a security issue. There is a need to ensure that there is not a conï¿½èating	of	people	seeking	asylum	with	threats	to national security and stability.

 â¢ People	seeking	asylum	and	refugees	should	be guiding discussions about asylum, and their skills and expertise in determining their own lives and futures must be recognised.

 â¢ Mobility	is	experienced	by	most	people	and	should be seen as part of human experience, not as an aberration or problem.

 iii. Promote Decent Livelihoods and Thriving Communities

 People seeking asylum must have the right to a  decent livelihood. Australia should allow them to live  in the Australian community and to have the right to  seek work, to education and to proper healthcare.  This would ensure that the psychological needs of  people seeking asylum, in particular children, are met  and that people are able to thrive.

 A large body of research has demonstrated that  denying asylum seekers the right to a secure  migration status, work, health, welfare and education  has serious and deleterious long-term effects on their  mental and physical health.12 Detaining children, in  particular, and denying them full access to education  can irreparably affect their mental and physical health  and their capacity to adjust and resettle in Australia.13   

 Under current Australian policy, some people seeking  asylum are not permitted full rights to work; to  welfare; to healthcare or to education. At present, the  Department of Immigration and Border Protection  has too much power and discretion over who is given  these rights and who is not.

 It is recommended that fundamental social and  economic rights be provided to all people seeking  asylum and refugees on a non-discriminatory basis  to ensure their dignity and health. We call for a policy  where refugees and asylum seekers are provided with  full rights to work, to education, to healthcare and to  sVJPHSï¿½^LSMHYL .

 ii. Australia can work with governments in the region

 to improve the conditions for refugees and people seeking asylum within their states, including granting access to work rights, education and health care. It can establish a principle of a prioritised obligation towards refugees from particularly dangerous countries of origin, including Afghanistan and Myanmar. Australia has a national interest and ethical responsibility to respond to people from these areas.

 iii. Australia can work with other states to promote bilateral and multilateral responses that enhance protection in the region. Existing multilateral forums include the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Bali Process for People Smuggling,	Human	Trafï¿½ècking	and	Transnational Crime, and the East Asia Summit, for example.

 Australia has the opportunity to reframe these forums towards a human rights based approach and enhance capacity across the region.

 iv. Australia can promote further regional consultation of experts, in particular consultation between migration experts, humanitarian actors and displaced people themselves.

 v. Australia should commit to ensuring that Australian aid money is not tied to the processing or detention of people seeking asylum.

 Australia should use its aid program more effectively to enhance refugee protection in the region, including through increased funding to the UNHCR and other NGOs.

 5. Regional Measures The	Asia	Paciï¿½èc	region	hosts	3.5	million	refugees,	1.9	 million internally displaced people and 1.4 stateless  people.15  Many people seeking asylum in Southeast  Asia have no rights to work, or access to healthcare  and education. This means that refugees are  particularly vulnerable and are in acute need of safe  pathways to spaces of protection.

 Australia	should	work	with	states	in	the	Asia	Paciï¿½èc	 region to contribute to a new regional approach  based on equity, capacity and responsibility.   At	present	the	Asia	Paciï¿½èc	region	lacks	a	 comprehensive mechanism for human rights based  approaches to people seeking asylum. There is  an opportunity for new thinking and humanitarian  leadership. Australia has the capacity to assume  a substantial responsibility for the protection and  resettlement of people seeking asylum in the Asia  Paciï¿½èc	region.	

 Australia can make a regional diï¿½èerence 	in	ï¿½ève	 key ways. 

 i. Australia should reinstate resettlement processes for refugees from the region. Australia drastically reduced its resettlement intake from the region in recent years, a decision that needs to be reversed. Regional resettlement processes might include:

 â¢ Adopting	a	strategic	resettlement	scheme, with the aim of building mutual cooperation with regional partners such as Thailand, Indonesia, New Zealand and Malaysia.

 â¢ Opening	up	options	for	asylum	seekers	and refugees to apply to migrate to Australia using the regular migration channels including being granted skilled and family visas.

 â¢ Assisting	with	orderly departure programmes so that people seeking asylum can do so in or near their home countries.

 â¢ Working	to	fulï¿½èl resettlement needs 	identiï¿½èed by the UNHCR. This means increasing the number of people that are accepted under Australia’s Humanitarian Program.

 â¢ Establishing	a	Global Refugee Fund to be used for immediate refugee relief measures in times of crisis.

 ii. Substantially Increase Australia’s Humanitarian Program: Each year around 190,000 people permanently migrate to Australia through its Migration Program. Refugees and their families	amount	to	less	than	7.3%	of	this	ï¿½ègure.

 Australia’s annual humanitarian intake in 2015 was only 13,750 people, with a further 12,000 places made available to those displaced by the war in Syria. In times of refugee crises, Australia has acted to implement exceptional measures. For example, in 1949, Australia resettled over 75,000 refugees while only having a population of 7 million people.

 Also, during the Indochinese crisis, Australia took around 100,000 refugees in the space of a few years. Australia has the capacity to undertake such action again.

 iii. Engage in a Strategic Global Dialogue for a New Humanitarian Compact: In April 2016, the UN Secretary General released a report calling for a new Global Compact on Responsibility-Sharing for Refugees. This Global Compact would work towards addressing the root causes of human displacement while also promoting the equitable and differential sharing of responsibility among states based on international law and proven good practices. Australia should constructively engage with proposals to develop a consensual and shared approach in a regional and international context.

 6. International Measures This year, human displacement hit an all-time high  with a staggering 65 million people forcibly displaced  from their homes.16  The UNHCR calculates that one  in every 122 people is now a refugee, asylum seeker  or	internally	displaced	person.	This	is	the	deï¿½èning	 humanitarian crisis of the 21st century and calls  for an unprecedented response from the global  community.

 The current international humanitarian system is  struggling to cope and needs to be reinvigorated.  States are seeking policy options. Australia should  contribute towards making the international system  more sustainable, equitable and humane. At present,  only a small proportion of the world’s refugees  have access to effective and durable spaces of  international protection. 

 Australia can take at least three international  measures in order to promote a new standard of  international humanitarianism:

 i. Expand the available safe pathways to refuge by substantially increasing UNHCR Funding and In-Country Assistance and Processing:

 Refugees need safe and viable pathways to ensure their safety, livelihoods and well-being. Australia can help to facilitate these pathways by offering greater assistance to UNHCR missions in refugee source countries and nearby host countries. It can provide and call for greater assistance to UN efforts to	address	the	root	causes	of	refugee	ï¿½èows.	This includes:

 7. Call for a National Policy Summit There is a need for a national conversation about  Australia’s responses to people seeking asylum.  The federal government should organise a Policy  Summit to bring together people seeking asylum,  refugees and former refugees; refugee advocates;  policy experts; community representatives and  politicians from all parties. Summit participants  should be appointed through broad consultation with  the wider community. The Summit would discuss  how to advance a just, humane and dignity-centred  Australian framework for people seeking asylum. The  experiences, knowledge and expertise of people from  a refugee background must be of central importance  throughout the discussions and should be recognised  as key to ensuring a just, humane and sustainable set  of policies.

 The two-day Summit should aim to identify  constructive policy options and solutions for people  seeking asylum that: 

 â¢ Recognise	the	need	for	people	to	seek	a	life	of safety for themselves and their families;

 â¢ Recognise	the	positive	contributions	of	refugees	to Australia’s communities;

 â¢ Respect	Australia’s	international	obligations;

 â¢ Reï¿½èect	a	working	and	respectful	relationship between Australia and its regional neighbours that ensures resettlement is a shared responsibility; and

 â¢ Recognise	Australia’s	potential	for	leadership	on	an issue that crosses national boundaries.

 It is proposed that this inclusive Policy Summit be  held in 2017. The Summit will seek to produce a Plan  of Action with concrete proposalZ  for change.  This Policy Paper seeks to present a set of options for  consideration at the Summit.
