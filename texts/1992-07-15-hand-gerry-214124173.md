 MIGRATION PROGRAM ON TARGET AS EXPECTED

 As expected, the number of places filled in the migration  program during 1991-92 matched the planned migrant intake  level, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and  Ethnic Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, said today.

 "Last year I announced that there would be 111,000 places  available for migrants in 1991-92," Mr Hand said. "I am  pleased to say that the figures came in very slightly under  the target; 110,894 migrants will make their homes in  Australia.

 "Continual monitoring of the program, combined with good  management practices, gave precisely the result I set out to  achieve."

 Overseas, 93,398 visas had been issued, and 17,496 residence  approvals had been granted within Australia. (Details are  attached).

 "The numbers of visas issued to people in the Family and the  Refugee, Humanitarian and Special Assistance categories were  on target," Mr Hand said.

 Visas issued in the Skill category were slightly lower than  planned, mainly because there was a lower-than-anticipated  demand for labour in the employer-sponsored category.

 "I indicated several times during the year that the program  would neither over-run nor fall short, despite media reports  to the contrary.

 "My Department is to be congratulated on bringing in the  program so close to target."
