 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 ALEXANDER DOWNER  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS   

 12 October 2007 

 Diplomatic Appointment - Ambassador to Brazil  Mr Neil Mules AO is to be Australia’s new Ambassador to the Federative Republic of Brazil. He will  replace Mr Peter Heyward, who has been Ambassador since July 2005. Mr Mules is expected to take up  his appointment in January 2008. 

 Australia and Brazil established diplomatic relations in 1945 and share a long history of close  cooperation. Brazil is Australia’s largest trading partner in South America, with two-way merchandise  trade exceeding A$1.7 billion in 2006. Coal is Australia’s main export to Brazil and there is significant  Australian investment in Brazil’s mining, agribusiness and finance sectors. Brazil, in turn, is increasing  its investment in Australia and is now Australia’s largest source of foreign students from Latin America.  Over 10,000 Brazilian nationals enrolled in Australian educational institutions in 2006 - more than  double the number in 2004. Both countries are working to strengthen and expand their scientific and  technical cooperation and expect to convene their first Ministerial level Bilateral Trade and Investment  Commission meeting in 2008. 

 Brazil and Australia work closely together, as members of the Cairns Group and in the WTO, for  agricultural trade liberalisation and a successful conclusion to the Doha Round of multilateral trade  negotiations. Australia and Brazil share a number of foreign and trade policy goals including a  commitment to UN reform and to cooperation on climate change and environmental protection. 

 Brazil is a strong proponent of regional development and integration in South America. It is a key  member of the South American Community of Nations and of Mercosur - the region’s premier trading  bloc. Australia and Brazil are also members of the Forum on East Asia - Latin America Cooperation  (FEALAC), which aims to increase mutual understanding, political dialogue and cooperation between  these two regions.  

 Mr Mules is a senior career officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and is currently  Australia’s Ambassador to the United Mexican States. He served as Head of the Australian  Representative Office in Baghdad prior to being appointed as Australian Ambassador to Iraq in June  2004. Mr Mules has also served as Deputy Head of Mission in Jakarta (2002-03); Counsellor in Hanoi  (1996-98); Counsellor in Jakarta (1992-95); First Secretary in Harare (1988-90); First Secretary in  Ankara (1985-88); and Third Secretary then later Second Secretary in Brasilia (1981-84). 

 In Canberra, Mr Mules was First Assistant Secretary, Diplomatic Security, Property and Information  Management Division (2000); Assistant Secretary, Maritime South East Asia Branch (1998-2000);  Director, Conditions of Service Section (1991-92); and Desk Officer, Refugees, Immigration and  Asylum Section (1984-85). 

 Mr Mules holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Flinders University. He was appointed an Officer in the  Order of Australia in April 2004 for his outstanding service as Australia’s representative in Iraq.
