 Media Release   

 ALAN GRIFFIN MP  Shadow Minister for Veterans’ Affairs 4 February 2006 LABOR TO CHANGE SERVICEIN RWANDA TO WARLIKE   A Labor government would change the classification of peacekeeping service in Rwanda from 1994-1995 to ‘Warlike’.  Currently, service in Rwanda is classified as ‘Hazardous’, not carrying any benefits above normal peacetime service.  Over 600 peacekeeping personnel served Rwanda in 1994 and 1995 as part of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR).  The Australian contingent was largely a medical team whose key role was to provide medial care and health support for UNAMIR and, where possible, those injured by the massacres.  These peacekeepers were clearly at risk and experienced the most horrible circumstances, including life threatening events during the massacre of up to 8,000 men women and children at the Kibeyo refugee camp in April 1995.  Despite the severe trauma and the danger faced by Australian Peacekeepers in Rwanda, their service is still not treated as warlike service under the Veterans Entitlement Act.   Many of these troops are now suffering serious mental and physical disabilities as the result of their service.   The classification of service in Rwanda as ‘Hazardous’ was clearly incorrect and this must be corrected as a priority.  If the Government will not change the classification of service in Rwanda, despite repeated pleas from the veteran community, then Labor will after the next election.  4 February 2006   Media contact:  Alan Griffin 0419 353 476
