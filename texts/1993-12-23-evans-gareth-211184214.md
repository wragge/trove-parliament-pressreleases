 MORE AUSTRALIAN AID FOR FORMER YUGOSLAVIA

 Australia will provide $500,000 worth of food aid and emergency assistance to help victims of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia survive winter, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Gareth Evans, said today.

 "The onset of winter, food shortages and lack of fuel are threatening the lives of thousands of people in the former Yugoslavia," Senator Evans said.

 "Australia strongly urges all parties to the conflict to establish a lasting peace and spare their people further trauma.

 'While diplomatic efforts to secure a peace settlement continue, Australia will provide further emergency assistance to complement the work of other donor countries and international relief efforts," Senator Evans said.

 Australia will provide $300,000 to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, the lead agency in the UN relief operation in the former Yugoslavia.

 UNHCR will use the funds to purchase and deliver shelter materials, heating fuel and essential household items as part  of its winter program.

 To help meet local food needs, Australia will supply 60 tonnes of Arnotts' high energy biscuits through the United Nations World Food Programme.

 The specially manufactured Australian biscuits will be particularly useful as they provide sustenance without the need to use fuel which is in extremely short supply.

 Senator Evans said the latest aid brings total Australian Government emergency assistance to the former Yugoslavia to $2.35 million.
