 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Environment and Immigration Spokesperson

 25 February 2002     MEDIA RELEASE                          02/078

 Refugees & Climate Change: CHOGM Must Prepare to Meet A Changing International Climate

 It has been predicted by a leading scientific body, that in 48 years time there will be 150 million environmental refugees, who have to leave their own country because of environmental disaster.

 As the CHOGM meeting approaches, the Australian Democrats today called attention to the prediction of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for 2050.

 Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Australian Democrats’ spokesperson for Environment and Immigration said, “The International Red Cross currently estimates that there are approximately 25 million refugees escaping environmental disaster worldwide.

 “These are refugees virtually ignored in the international humanitarian arena, yet most of them are affected by climate change.

 “Rising sea levels, storms of greater intensity, coastal flooding, shoreline erosion and disrupted agriculture are going to combine to create a refugee problem unprecedented in human history.

 “If we can’t work at preventing such harm and at the same time show the world’s most desperate people a humanitarian face, we will be overwhelmed by the problems of the next 50 years,” Senator Bartlett said.

 “Australia doesn’t like to admit to any responsibility for the refugee problem worldwide. But we cannot deny our responsibility for those left homeless because of climate change.

 “Australia contributes 1-2 per cent of global greenhouse emissions contributing to climate change. If we take 1-2 per cent of the projected number of refugees in 2050, we’d be directly responsible for approximately 1.2 - 2.4 million displaced people.

 “It is obvious that Australia can’t physically cope with those numbers. Neither can Nauru. Prevention is the only way to stem the tidal wave of environmental refugees,” Senator Bartlett said

 “We must first ratify Kyoto and then start making difficult decisions about how to reduce our greenhouse impacts on the people and ecosystems of the world.

 “We must also put in place far better mechanisms for international aid programs to deal with the displacement likely to occur as a result of climate change. We need to change our attitudes and ensure that displaced peoples receive the most appropriate care and support available,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “Australia’s current policies - deep denial of climate change and isolationist anti-humanitarian attitudes to refugees is short sighted and goes no way to tackling the real issues,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
