 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 

 Boat K130 arrives but Rudd wants to stop the wrong boats 

 Friday 4th June 2010 

 The arrival of boat K130, with 30 people on board, comes as Kevin Rudd works to stop the 

 wrong boats, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Shadow Minister for 

 Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and 

 Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 

 “If Kevin Rudd was as serious about ending the profits of people smugglers as he is about 

 ending the profits of mining companies in Australia then he would be implementing policies 

 to stop illegal boat arrivals,” Mr Morrison said. 

 

 “The only boats Kevin Rudd wants to stop are those leaving Australia carrying iron ore from 

 our mines,” he said. 

 

 “Figures from Senate Estimates reveal that, including this latest arrival, 6,083 people have 

 now arrived illegally by boat since Kevin Rudd softened the Coalition’s strong immigration 

 and border protection regime. 

 

 “This comes as the Rudd Government is reportedly planning to transfer 750 asylum seekers 

 whose claims have not been tested, from Christmas Island to the mainland - the largest 

 number of mainland transfers so far. 

 

 “These asylum seekers will be sent to an isolated mining community in Western Australia 

 and to the Curtin Detention Centre near Derby which will reopen soon, meaning yet more 

 border blow outs to add to the $1 billion immigration blow out this financial year. 

 

 “The Coalition has a clear plan to stop the boats. If elected, a Coalition government would - 

 commence discussions to establish an off shore processing detention facility in another 

 country, reintroduce Temporary Protection Visas and the 45 day rule, and stop the boats 

 where circumstances allow. 

 

 “Labor has failed, only the Coalition has the policies and the will necessary to take the tough 

 decisions needed to stop illegal boat arrivals,” Mr Morrison said. 

 

 Mr Keenan said: “Three Customs and Border Protection vessels have been sent to respond 

 to this latest arrival. That’s three vessels that aren’t patrolling Australia’s borders. 

 

 “The rate at which these boats are arriving has left the Customs and Border Protection 

 Service overstretched and under resourced,” he said. 

 

 “In his press release, the Minister has once again omitted key details regarding the 

 circumstances of this latest arrival, including where and when the boat was intercepted. 

 

 “This is a typical smoke and mirrors ploy from a Government that is increasingly distancing 

 itself from a problem it doesn’t have the resolve to fix. 

 

 “Only the Coalition has the resolve to take the necessary action to stop the boats from 

 coming and restore Australia’s border protection system,” he said.
