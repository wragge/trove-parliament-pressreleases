 Senator Meg Lees Parliamentary Leader and Senator for South Australia

 Press Release Dated: 15 Mar 2001 Press Release Number: 01/163 Portfolio: Foreign Affairs Related: Miscellaneous

 Democrats candidate awarded East Timor bravery citation and United Nations Medal Democrats’ Leader, Senator Meg Lees, today congratulated the Director of the party’s national office and ACT Senate candidate on the award of a group bravery citation and the United Nations Medal earned while serving as part of the Australian Federal Police in East Timor.

 Senator Lees said Mr Wayne Sievers, who is part of a contingent of 52 Australian Federal Police to receive a group bravery citation from the Governor General, now works full-time as the Director of the Democrats National Office in Canberra.

 “Mr Sievers was part of the unarmed UNAMET mission which supervised the East Timor election, placing his own life at risk to help protect the lives of those who wanted to cast a vote in the election which ultimately gave East Timor its independence from Indonesia,” said Senator Lees.

 “He stayed with thousands of refugees during the siege of the UN compound in Dili by local militias and sympathetic elements of the Indonesian military. He also came under fire while helping lead convoys in the evacuation of UN staff.

 “The Democrats are fortunate that such an experienced professional as Mr Sievers has chosen to work with the Democrats and to run as our ACT candidate in the next federal election.

 “This is the first group of police to be recognised for their contribution to Australia’s peacekeeping efforts in East Timor and I congratulate all those receiving the award.

 “In supervising the delivery of ballot papers, these officers of the Australian Federal Police were subjected to violence and abuse by local militias and deserve every recognition for their bravery.

 “Mr Sievers, and all those being honoured, do not consider themselves heroes. They have come back to Australia and to their daily lives.

 “The rest of Australia disagrees. These men and women of the AFP risked their lives for democracy and we are grateful for their efforts,” concluded Senator Lees.
