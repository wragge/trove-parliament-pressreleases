 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Tuesday, 20 October 2015   

 Refugee who self-immolated in Victoria needed  better care   

 The Australian Greens have expressed their condolences for a 30-year-old Afghan Hazara man who  came to Australia seeking safety but, tragically, died after setting himself alight in Victoria on  Sunday.   

 “I was deeply saddened to learn about this shocking incident. My thoughts are with this young man’s  family and his friends,” Senator Hanson-Young said.   

 “I have been told that his fear of being returned to immigration detention and sent back to  Afghanistan drove him to take this extreme action. Despite questioning the Immigration Department  in Senate Estimates yesterday, I’m disappointed that no one has been able to explain exactly what  happened in this instance.   

 “What is clear is that the government’s cruel treatment of refugees is having disastrous effects for  people both in detention and in the community.   

 “There needs to be a full, independent investigation into this case so that we can understand why  this young man didn’t receive the support that he so clearly needed.   

 “As a nation, we need to think long and hard about how we treat people who have come to Australia  seeking safety and care.”
