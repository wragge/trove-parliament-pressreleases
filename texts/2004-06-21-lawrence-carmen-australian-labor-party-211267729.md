 MEDIA STATEMENT   

 Hon Dr Carmen Lawrence MP  Federal Member for Fremantle   

 Monday 21 June, 2004 

 

 DR CARMEN LAWRENCE TO OPEN   SAVE -Australia CONFERENCE   

 Dr Carmen Lawrence is proud to be opening the Conference "National Forum on  Mental Health and Human Rights in the Political Context of Contemporary  Australia" to be held in Parliament House, Canberra today. 

 The Conference has been organized by SAVE Australia in association with other  humanitarian organizations who recognise that people whose human rights are  severely challenged often have serious related mental health issues.    

 Dr Lawrence said the Howard Government had been dismissive and even  contemptuous of the incidence of mental illness amongst refugees.     

 “The great majority of the people we keep behind razor wire fences have already  survived torture and ill treatment, experiences predictive of later serious mental  illness. It takes concerted, skilled, professional intervention to help people  recover. Further detention, exacerbates the problem especially if they are  confronted by the possibility of deportation if their applications fail.”     

 Dr Lawrence said that human rights issues were of particular concern as they  were not being given due respect and attention by the government.  A glaring  example was the HREOC Report. 

 

  “It is shameful that the Government has taken no notice of this report and  continues to hold children in detention.  They are ignoring the recommendations  and pretending that the children are not suffering or being harmed.  They are  also contravening the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Australia is  a signatory.”    

 “I welcome the opportunity to address and be part of a Conference which raises  awareness of the problems of the mental illness suffered by people held in  detention, the treatment of people seeking asylum and the lack of a duty of care  and responsibility for all children.”
