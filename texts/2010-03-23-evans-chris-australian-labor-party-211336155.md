 Conflict, insecurity and displacement are key to asylum applications 

 Tuesday, 23 March 2010 

 The Australian Government today welcomed the United Nations High Commission  for Refugees’ 2009 report on Asylum Levels and Trends in Industrialized Countries.  

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, said the report  was a timely reminder that push factors such as conflict and human insecurity are  the key reasons why people flee their homes to seek protection in industrialised  countries like Australia. 

 The UNHCR report makes clear that asylum applications in Australia in 2009 are still  half what they were in 2000 and 2001 under the Howard Government.  

 The report explicitly states that ‘figures in Australia remain not only below those  observed in 2000 (13 100 claims) and 2001 (12 400 claims) but also far below those  recorded by many other industrialised countries’. 

 The report emphasised the number of arrivals to Australia remains low by world  standards: Australia in 2009 received less than 2 per cent of all applications for  asylum in the industrialised world. 

 The UNHCR report is also a reminder that Australia’s recent experience of boat  arrivals is part of the global challenge of irregular migration.  

 Australia was among a number of industrialised countries who experienced an  increase in asylum seeker applications in 2009: Australia’s increase of 29 per cent  compared with Hungary (+50 per cent), Finland (+47 per cent), Poland (+47 per  cent), Belgium (+40 per cent) and New Zealand (+36 per cent). 

 Significantly, given that Afghans represent the largest cohort of Australia’s boat  arrivals since late 2008, asylum claims by Afghans worldwide increased by some 45  per cent in 2009.  

 The UNHCR report indicates that Afghan asylum-seekers are now, for the first time  since 2001, the largest group seeking asylum in industrialised countries.  

 While Australia has experienced an increase in Afghan asylum seekers - broadly in  line with similar trends to comparable other countries such as Norway and Germany 

 - it has not experienced increases in other asylum trends such as the increase of  asylum seekers from Zimbabwe to the United Kingdom. 

 Senator Evans said these trends demonstrated how conflict and displacement in  Australia’s region impacted on boat arrivals to Australia.
