 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS 

 The Hon. Kevin Rudd MP 

 FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL APOLOGY TO INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIANS   

 GOVERNMENT HOUSE, SYDNEY  10 FEBRUARY 2012   

 

 CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY   

 I begin by acknowledging the first Australians on whose land we meet and whose cultures  we celebrate as among the oldest continuing cultures in human history.    

 The National Apology to Indigenous Australians was the first act of the Australian Parliament  following the election of the Australian Labor Government in 2007.   

 That was four years ago.   

 In the four years since then, some things have changed.   

 Many have not.   

 But the question we must ask ourselves each Anniversary, with soul-searching clarity, is  what progress has been made to realise the mission we set for ourselves in bringing about  genuine reconciliation in Australia.    

 Let me try and answer this question with a tale of two cities - one the Nation’s capital; the  second, on the other side of this vast continent of ours.   

 Yesterday I spoke with Donna, a member of the Stolen Generations.    

 She had come to Canberra on the day of the Apology having persuaded her younger brother  to come with her and sit on the lawns of Parliament House.   

 Donna and her younger brother belonged to a family of seven children, all of whom were  taken from their mother one night, more than half a century ago.  

 

 Minister’s Office: 02 6277 7500 or 0434 664 589

 The oldest was nine, the youngest were twins at three months old, Donna herself was five.  Just old enough to remember and therefore relive the trauma.   

 As was the custom, the family was split up. Donna did not see her mother for another 23  years.   

 Donna in the meantime had been adopted by a wonderful family of Yugoslav and Romanian  migrants who having come to this country wanted desperately to raise a child from this  country.   

 And in Donna’s words they did so with wonderful love, care and attention.    

 When Donna was 28, her indigenous mother appeared on the doorstep.     

 Let’s pause for a moment and reflect on the sheer emotions as mother and daughter were  reunited: fear, guilt, remorse, distance, longing, and just plain simple numbness.   

 As Donna said to me, almost phlegmatically, she had a further seven years with her mum  before she died at the grand old age of 52.   

 Donna’s is the very human face of the National Apology.    

 She told me that she and her brother wept, as many others did that day, as we found  ourselves in the midst of the emotions that flowed between those who had been wronged  and those who were responsible.    

 But the important part of Donna’s story for me yesterday was what happened on her way  back home to Brisbane.   

 That day, she told me, both she and her brother felt differently because others began  treating them differently.   

 People at the service station asked if they were Aboriginal and what they thought of the  Apology.   

 Some apologised.    

 Others hugged them.   

 When they sat down in a cafÃ©, others in the cafÃ© broke out in applause.   

 And here’s the killer line - Donna told me the service was better too.    

 What a terrible thing that it took us a couple of hundred years for the First Australians to be  treated like any other customer in the local store.    

 And so began the long, slow process of healing for the family of Donna Meehan.    

 

 Minister’s Office: 02 6277 7500 or 0434 664 589

 Let me also tell you the story from another city - Geraldton - in Australia’s west.    

 I’ve been to Geraldton.    

 It’s a great city.   

 High on the hill overlooking the Indian Ocean it has an extraordinary monument to the  sinking of HMAS Sydney with all hands in 1941 off the Geraldton coast.   

 Geraldton is also home to a significant Indigenous community.   

 This brings me to the story of the Mid-West Clontarf Academy - part of the Clontarf  Foundation established less than a decade ago “to improve the education, discipline, self-esteem, life skills and employment prospects of young Indigenous men”.  

 

 Clontarf Academies now operate across 45 schools in Western Australia, Victoria and  Northern Territory supporting around 2,500 Aboriginal students.   

 As Prime Minister, I’m proud to have launched a major financial partnership with Clontarf  Academy as we sought to support private initiatives across the country to help close the gap  between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.  

 

 In 2004, average Indigenous male enrolment in secondary schooling in Geraldton was 30 -  with an average attendance rate of 51 per cent.    

 In 2012, there are 150 Indigenous males enrolled in secondary education (in partnerships  with the Clontarf Academy) with an average attendance rate of 77 per cent.   In 2004 there were only 17 Indigenous males in year 11 and 12.    

 This year there are 61.    

 Over the last two years, Clontarf has had 33 young Indigenous men complete year 12 in  their Mid-West Academy in Geraldton with the following results:   

 â¢ 9 apprenticeships;  â¢ 5 in-traineeships;  â¢ 6 working full time;   â¢ One working part time;   â¢ Two completing pre-employment programs;   â¢ One doing year 12;   â¢ And 9 still seeking work.    

 This of course is not a perfect score.    

 But from little things, big things grow.    

 And we see these buds shooting up in many, many places right across the nation in a myriad  of creative partnerships between governments at all levels, local communities and local  employers.  

 

 Minister’s Office: 02 6277 7500 or 0434 664 589

 I spoke before about a tale of two cities.    

 Perhaps I should mention a third.    

 Last night Therese and I had dinner with a wonderful group of people from Albury.   

 Without any support, they’ve established a charity called Carevan.    

 Begun only a couple of years ago by a local orthodontist, John Brabant, Carevan is now  supported by several hundred local volunteers.    

 Their mission is simple: to provide hot meals four nights a week for homeless people, or  those deemed more broadly to be socially-vulnerable, and to offer consistent love, care and  attention to those who in their normal lives are offered none.   

 Their charity is not exclusively focused on Indigenous Australians.   

 It’s focused on all Australians.   

 And those whom they support are split between white Australians, newly arrived refugees  as well as local Aboriginal people.    

 They also run a program every week called “Midnight Basketball” which has three simple  disciplines:   

 A meal together;    

 A short workshop on basic life skills like cleaning your teeth;    

 And then and only then competitive basketball.    

 I’m told the local Mayor now attends the finals where hundreds of people turn up with  teams made up of anyone and everyone - refugees from Somalia, local Anglo-Celts suffering  inter-generational disadvantage, local Aboriginal kids altogether.    

 Carevan tell me that after barely 18 months, this has begun to become transformative, not  just for those who are supported by Carevan’s programs, but by the growing army of  volunteers as well - as Australians once again rediscover the ancient wisdom that “it is in  giving that you receive”.    

 I asked John what he thought was working most in his local community.    

 His answer was simple.    

 Consistency of care.   

 For Indigenous Australians in particular, many have become accustomed to well- meaning  white fellas coming and going.  

 

 Minister’s Office: 02 6277 7500 or 0434 664 589

 For the real hard business of reconciliation does not lie in high-sounding speeches like the  Apology, it lies in genuine heart-felt commitment - staying the course.   

 Consistency both on the part of non-Indigenous and Indigenous Australians because the  process of reconciliation is always gradual.    

 And for the record, I asked the good people from Albury whether the hundreds of Aboriginal  people they support through their work each year had ever mentioned the Apology.    

 The truth is, none of them had.    

 Just as I suspect is the case in so many, many Indigenous communities right across Australia,  most particularly in rural and remote Australia.   

 And this is because the even more fundamental truth is that we are still barely scratching  the surface in the hard mission of reconciliation on which our nation has at last embarked.    

 Closing the Gap   

 So what have we achieved so far?   

 Aboriginal people tell me there has been some healing of the soul for our First Australians  over the last several years.    

 They also tell me that they have a new-found sense of dignity, identity and respect, in part  because the attitude of non-Indigenous Australians is changing.    

 The truth is both these are slow processes and intangibles such as these by definition  ultimately defy measurement.    

 But intangible does not mean unimportant.   

 Because these deep questions of respect and self-respect radically influence what we do,  whether we are conscious of it or not.    

 What can be measured are the specific ambitious targets we set for the nation as part of  closing the gap.   

 Against these targets, some progress has been made.   

 

 

 â¢ There has been a significant decrease in the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous child mortality rates. I am advised the results are consistent with the  trajectory we have set to halve the mortality gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous under the age of 5 by 2018.   

 

 Minister’s Office: 02 6277 7500 or 0434 664 589

 â¢ Since 2009, more Indigenous children living in remote communities have enrolled in  early childhood education programs - although we are still a long way from  achieving access for all four year olds in remote Indigenous communities within the  five years that was set.   

 â¢ The literacy and numeracy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous at years 3,5,  7 and 9 has declined, with the largest decline being for year 3 reading.   

 â¢ The retention rate for year 12 students has increased from 30 per cent in 1995 to 47  per cent in 2010, while the gap in retention rates between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians has fallen from 42 per cent to 32 per cent over the same  period.    

 â¢ There has been some improvement in Indigenous employment, but much, much  work remains to be done.   

 â¢ On housing, the Australian Government’s National Partnership Agreement on  Remote Indigenous Housing has seen nearly 3,700 homes refurbished; 1,024 new  houses completed and a further 2096 under construction; furthermore the 20 per  cent target for Indigenous housing construction has been met.   

 The Prime Minister next week will provide a more detailed report on these measures in  Parliament when the annual report on ‘Closing the Gap’ is delivered in the House of  Representatives.    

 We must be honest about the fact that much, more work needs to be done.   

 Just as we must be honest about the fact that real progress is being realised.   

 And above all, we must stay the course - otherwise the Apology and the hope that it offered  all Australians will become little more than an archived document rather than a living  compact to Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.    

 So what of the future?   

 So where to from here?   

 The Apology has been delivered.    

 The Closing the Gap targets have been embraced by all levels of government.    

 The $5.5 billion National Partnerships Agreement between the Commonwealth and the  States was negotiated and signed in 2009.    

 So the framework is clear.    

 The funding has been allocated.    

 

 Minister’s Office: 02 6277 7500 or 0434 664 589

 And we are all (I hope) marching to the beat of the same drum - embraced, I also believe,  by an overwhelming community resolve that the business of national reconciliation be not  just embraced, but ultimately completed.    

 But I’d like to make one further comment on how this might best be done.   

 I believe we will only ever close the gap through an enduring three way partnership  between governments, Indigenous Australians and the wider community.   

 As the very wise Fred Chaney once reminded us: “You cannot do good things to Aboriginal  people, you could only do good things with Aboriginal people”.    

 But for this partnership to be complete, it must also embrace the community itself; the  business sector, private foundations, local church and community sector organisations.    

 I believe the most powerful combination is this: governments enabling; communities  facilitating; and Indigenous Australians participating.   

 In closing the gap, we must harness more and more of the creative enterprise and  philanthropic spirit alive in the Australian corporate community - and the wider community  as well.    

 Clontarf is funded con-jointly between the Federal Government, State and Territory  Governments and the business community.    

 It works.    

 The Australian Indigenous Education Foundation has a $40 million partnership between the  Australian Government and private fundraising which has seen the number of Indigenous  scholarships grow from one in 2008 to over 225 this year involving 24 of our nation’s leading  boarding schools - helping build the Indigenous leadership of the future.   

 It works.     

 

 The Australian Employment Covenant involving our nation’s largest companies has  committed to roll out a total of more than 50,000 jobs to Indigenous Australians although  much remains to be done on how this is appropriately matched with the necessary pre-employment training to turn all these job opportunities into concrete employment realities.    

 I’ve already spoken of local community organisations like Carevan and the hundreds like  them around the nation.   

 Today we also have major corporates with us like the Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, the  National Australian Bank, Westfield, News Limited, KPMG and Allens who each have  significant individual programs to advance Indigenous employment and opportunities.  

 

 So too do our major mining companies like BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals.    

 

 Minister’s Office: 02 6277 7500 or 0434 664 589

 And the list is much, much longer again.   

 Conclusion   

 I believe we have it within our wit and wisdom as Australians from all walks of life to make  this thing that we call reconciliation work.   

 And if we do it well, not only will we change the nation, we can also become something of a  light on the hill to the rest of the world.    

 In Australia there are something like half a million Indigenous people.    

 Around the world there are 370 million Indigenous peoples.    

 Our experience in this country is part of a much wider experience of settler communities  and Indigenous peoples across the Americas, Africa and Asia.   

 Following the Australian Apology, the Japanese Parliament in a bipartisan motion for the  first time recognised the Aniou people as the indigenous peoples of Japan.   

 The Canadian Parliament then apologised to the Aboriginal people of that country.   

 The Australian Government is now in the process of preparing a referendum for the  Constitutional recognition of the First Australians.    

 In 2007 after 25 years drafting, the UN adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous  People, only four countries voted against that Declaration in 2007.    

 Australia was one of them.    

 In 2009 we rectified that by announcing our support for the Declaration.   

 The other three countries have since followed suit.    

 In 2011 I appointed our first ever Indigenous Australian as the United Nations Youth  Representative, Benson Saulo.   

 I’m also in the process of appointing Indigenous Australians to the Australian National  Commission for UNESCO.   

 Similarly, the Australian delegation to the Commission on the Status of Women being held  in New York later this month will include two indigenous delegates.   

 And I repeat a commitment I made last year, that within the term of this Parliament I will  appoint the first Indigenous Australian as one of our Ambassadors abroad.    

 I am determined that the face of Indigenous Australia be increasingly incorporated into  Australia’s international diplomacy - the face of modern Australia.   

 

 Minister’s Office: 02 6277 7500 or 0434 664 589                                        

 9 

 

 Just as I am determined that the resources and energies of Australian diplomatic and  development policy also be directed to a forward-leaning international Indigenous policy  agenda.    

 Our objective here is to make a difference not just for Indigenous Australians, but by  example and by diplomacy for the indigenous peoples of the world.   

 So that the stories of Donna Meehan, the boys in Geraldton and the families supported by  Carevan, and all the stories like them, provide a positive narrative of hope both at home and  abroad.
