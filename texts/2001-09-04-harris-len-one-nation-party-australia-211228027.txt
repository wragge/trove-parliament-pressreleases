 MEDIA RELEASE 04 - 09 - 01

 ILLEGAL BOAT PEOPLE BACKDOORING AUSTRALIA! “The issue involving the M V Tampa should be separated into several main issues”, Senator Harris said.

 The movement of people across any countries borders without the sanction, of those countries, is not acceptable, irrespective of whose borders have been breached, or, where the people have come from.

 Norway, like Australia, suffers breaches of their borders and accepts their quota of genuine refugees through the U N H C R  program.

 So why is this boatload of people so different? They, like so many others, have paid exorbitant money to the people traffickers, the adults have made a deliberate decision to step on to the first boat and willingly took children with them. A short time after leaving Indonesia, the ‘rust bucket’ they consciously stepped on to was in danger of sinking while still in Indonesia waters.

 Where are the calls of condemnation of the people smugglers for not having a seaworthy boat, life rafts and a life jacket for every person on board the ‘rust bucket’?

 They were then rescued by the Captain of the M V Tampa, who was enroute to Singapore; he is to be commended for his act of compassion.  Senator Harris said, “people have come on ‘rust buckets’ and have been rescued before, but this is where the similarity ends!”

 The very people, from the ‘rust bucket’, who the MV Tampa rescued from death by drowning or worse being taken by sharks, then turned on the Captain and crew and threatened them to the extent that they feared for their lives and had to lock themselves in the bridge.

 The rescue was on instruction from the Indonesia’s search and rescue co-ordinators who took responsibility for the rescue and advised the captain of the ‘Tampa’ to proceed to Merak in Indonesia with its cargo of boat people.

 These ungrateful people then threatened to jump into the shark-infested water if the Captain did not change course from Singapore and go straight to Australia.  The Captain, not willing to have that on his conscience, in a humane endeavour, set his course for Christmas Island.

 Previously, illegal immigrants have not hijacked anyone who has rescued them; therefore the international conventions for rescue on the high seas have operated successfully.  It is this boatload of ungrateful people who have placed this life saving custom in jeopardy.

 Courier Mail Friday 31st August, reports a fishing boat carrying about 35 people suspected of trying to land illegally on Cyprus, the Cypriot police turned them away, they are thought to be Iraqis, the police described them as being “illegal migrants”.

 The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Ms Helen Clark says, “New Zealand may consider accepting a number of these people!”  Senator Harris said, “this is because she knows they only have to reside in New Zealand for two years to have automatic entry into, guess where, AUSTRALIA!”
