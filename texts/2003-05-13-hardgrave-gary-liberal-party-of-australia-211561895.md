 Government maintains commitment to multicultural programs   

 

 The Howard Government has made a multi-million dollar commitment to targeted  settlement services, multicultural and Australian citizenship programs, the Minister  for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, said today.   

 “The 2003-04 Budget maintains initiatives of up to $230 million for settlement services  for new arrivals, multicultural programs and the Australian Citizenship program.   

 “This is a clear demonstration of the Government’s commitment to programs which  ensure our society is united in its diversity and reaping the many social and economic  dividends of our diversity at work,” Mr Hardgrave said.    

 “It is a commitment which has made Australia a world leader in this field of nation  building.”   

 The settlement package includes English language tuition, interpreting and translating  assistance, counselling, information and referral services and targeted programs for  refugees and humanitarian entrants.   

 “Providing such services and support for newly arrived migrants and refugees is a truly  worthy investment in their successful future in this great country,” Mr Hardgrave said.   

 “These services help to ensure they can participate equitably and effectively in Australian  society.”   

 Special initiatives are also in place to promote Australian Citizenship as the unifying  force in the Australian community and to encourage eligible permanent residents to  acquire citizenship.   

 “Becoming an Australian citizen is perhaps the ultimate step for new arrivals, marking  the conclusion of the immigration journey and the beginning of life as a full member of  the Australian community, with all the responsibilities and privileges that this entails,” 

 Mr Hardgrave said.   

 “An indication of the significance of the work the Government is doing is reflected in the  overall take-up rate for citizenship which has increased from 73 per cent in 1996 to just  over 75 per cent in 2001,” said Mr Hardgrave.   

 The Citizenship take-up rate is the percentage of overseas born persons who have been  permanent residents in Australia for two years or more and, who from this group have  chosen to aquire Australian citizenship. 

 

 Mr Hardgrave also announced funding of $3.3 million over three years for the Howard  Government’s new multicultural policy Multicultural Australia: United in Diversity, and  that a new Council for Multicultural Australia would be appointed in July 2003. (Please  see separate media release).   

 “The new policy gives increased emphasis to the importance of community harmony,  which is particularly important in the current international climate.”   

 “All these initiatives have positive outcomes which are not accidental. They are  underpinned by the Government’s and the Australian community’s positive and  welcoming attitude to migrants.”
