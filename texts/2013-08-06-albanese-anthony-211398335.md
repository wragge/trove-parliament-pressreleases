 PM:                                         It is great to be here with Deputy Prime Minister 

 Anthony Albanese and welcome to Brissy and to our  Candidate for the Federal seat of Brisbane, Fiona  McNamara. This is a beautiful part of Australia, we  are in the botanic gardens with the Brisbane river  behind us. We have talked a lot in recent times about  the management of our economy and this is critical  for the nation's future. To make sure that our  economy remains strong, that we are protecting jobs  and managing cost of living pressures for working  families.  

 

 The truth is that we face new economic challenges  with the end of the mining boom and that means that  we have got to ensure in the future we have a new  way of not having all our eggs in one basket, a new  way of diversifying the economy, broadening the  economic base, building new industries and driving  that through a new national competitiveness agenda.  

 

                                                 (inaudible)  

 

 It depends upon your energy prices, it depends upon  your labour force productivity, your business  productivity, it depends on your approvals process to 

 get projects going at a reasonable time. It depends on  your skills, it depends on small business formation  and it depends on having world class infrastructure.  That is part of the Government's nation-building  agenda. It is becoming doubly important for the future  that we have the best infrastructure we can provide.     

 That is why Albo, for example, has been around the  country, supporting the National Broadband Network.  It will turbo-charge productivity in the future, whether  it’s through small businesses or big and it overcomes  the tyranny of distance. I was asked this morning in  my local community, how do we make sure that the  best jobs will be available in Queensland in the future  so that people don't have to go down to Sydney and  Melbourne to get the best possible jobs? Part of the  answer lies in first-class modern infrastructure, a  National Broadband Network that works.    

 On top of that as well, we’ve got other infrastructure  which is necessary to help our cities function and  public transport infrastructure is key to that. Albo has  been in charge of nation-building since the  Government was first formed, he’s the Minister for  nation building and he is passionate about it. He is  around the country and on the job all the time. We  have deliberately decided, as an Australian  Government, to invest in this country's public  transport infrastructure and its urban rail networks in  particular. Here in Brisbane, those of you who have  followed the debates closely in recent decades will  know that there have been plans and plans and plans  to build the Redcliffe rail link. This Government's  making that happen after decades and decades of  nothing ever happening. But we are also looking at  the actual future of the inner city rail network as well  and that is why we have put forward Cross River Rail,  a really important project for the future.     

 It is about making sure that people can get to the city  and back in a reasonable stretch of time so that they  can attend to their family responsibilities but also get  to their place of work. This is a great project. It is a  great project because of what it does for transport  needs, it is great project for what it does also for the  needs of our businesses located in the city, but it is a 

 great project also for the environment and a terrific  project when it comes to the impact on jobs.     

 This project alone, the Queensland Government told  us earlier on, would be worth just under 6,000 direct  and indirect jobs. Mr Newman's Government seems  to be happy laying 14,000 people off. We're about  putting 6,000 people on through this project, that is  why it is so good. The disappointing thing for us is  that despite having reached agreement just before the  last budget, for this project to proceed, the Liberal  National government in Queensland walked away  from it because Tony Abbott said that a Liberal  Government will never fund urban rail networks.  Urban rail networks are not something that he is going  to pay any attention to or fund.    

 The bulk of Australians live in cities, they are  demanding to have decent public transport systems,  not just for convenience but to keep the economies  going as well. That is why this is such an important  project. The Coalition pulled the rug from under the  funding. The Liberals, through their Federal  leadership said "No way JosÃ©, that is the end of that"  and guess who suffers? The people of Brisbane. This  project is essential for Brisbane's future. The rail  network in Brisbane will be clogged by 2016 unless  we build this cross River link. It will help people on the  north side, people on the south side as well. That is  one part of economic management, making sure we  have got best infrastructure for the future to boost our  productivity to diversify the economy in the future and  to deal with the new challenges coming at us.     

 I notice there have been a few other debates on the  economy in the last day or so as well and I think it is  important that we focus on those because in the last  24 hours people would be entitled to conclude that the  Liberals economic management credentials are now a  shambles. We had yesterday Mr Abbott's treasury  spokesman say that in fact we should not be in the  position where interest rates are being cut. That is  what he said and today Mr Abbott fundamentally  contradicts him and says that we shouldn’t have an  interest rate cut.     

 Yesterday, we had Mr Abbott's Treasury spokesman  saying that the Liberal Party would not be producing a  budget bottom line and this morning we had Mr  Abbott overriding him again and saying “yes, the  Liberal Party will produce its own costings and  savings". Well can I say if you have the alternative  Prime Minister and the alternative Treasurer within 24  hours having a fundamental public blue about interest  rates policy and about the budget bottom line, this not  only suggests they are in a shambles but questions  their fitness for office.     

 These are serious matters. Interest rates policy as  well as the budget bottom line and I conclude on this -  why is the budget bottom line doubly important for  Queensland? Because we have seen what the  Queensland Liberal National Party government does  with budget bottom lines. What they do is go out there  without prior announcement before an election, so  they have a commission of audit and they come in  and slash 14,000 jobs, 4,400 health workers, deep  cuts to education and health with no mandate to do so  prior to the election.     

 Mr Abbott through his Treasury spokesman says they  have $70 billion that they have to cut in terms of jobs,  health, education. Frankly, this is a huge question, not  just for the country but particularly for people in  Queensland. What you had with Mr Newman's Liberal  National Party government in Queensland is merely  entrÃ©e, with Mr Abbott you get served the main  course which is slash and burn to job cuts, cuts to  health, cuts to education. That is why projects like this  are so important for the city's future, for productivity's  future and also for the future of jobs. Albo?     

 DPM:                                      Thanks very much Prime Minister. It is great to be 

 back here. We were here in May after our budget with  the then Member for Griffith and the Candidate for  Brisbane - still are, but you ever a different title now  and so do I. It is fantastic to be back here with you  Prime Minister for my first event of this campaign. I  can't think of anything more important.                 

 We were here in May because we committed $715  million in partnership with the Queensland 

 Government that was also to contribute $715 million  to make sure that the Cross River Rail project went  ahead, to take 14,000 cars off Brisbane's roads, to  make sure that we could have new trains through  Brisbane, not just benefitting Brisbane but also  benefitting the Gold Coast and benefitting the  Sunshine Coast. Four new railway stations here in  Brisbane. A fantastic project that had been assessed  by Infrastructure Australia as the number one priority  in the nation. Having a look at cost benefit analysis,  looking at what the benefit to the economy would be,  what the benefit to jobs, what the social and  environmental benefit would be and guess what? This  project came out number one. That is why we got  together with Queensland and negotiated out an  agreement, an agreement of $715 million from each  level of government and then an availability payment  model into the future, mobilising private sector funds  through superannuation or other areas to make sure  this project got done. Because the Queensland  Government itself says that this city will enter gridlock  around 2016 if this project doesn't proceed.     

 That is why we were surprised. Not surprised by Tony  Abbott but surprised that the Queensland  Government walked away from the arrangement.  Since then, Minister Emerson and Premier Newman  have tried to say there wasn't an arrangement. Well  today, I can say that on 21 June, so a bit over a  month ago, Scott Emerson wrote to me as a result of  the Australian and Queensland budgets and said the  following: "Until speaking about the issue that they  say is getting in the way, that is the carve up GST, we  were asked to treat this project the same as Bruce  Highway funding, the same as the Ipswich motorway  and the same as every other infrastructure project  going ahead” but he said this "I ask that the $100  million of savings that was previously agreed to be set  aside for this project be quarantined for redirection to  other priority projects within Queensland". Mr  Emerson with this letter is confirming that not only did  we have an agreement, we had an absolute profile of  when the funding would commence, with $100 million  in 2012/13 to make sure that this project could be  turbo-charged because it is an urgent project for  Queensland.  

 

 But why is this amongst the important infrastructure  priorities? This election on September 7 will be about  a range of differences between the Government and  the Coalition. There is no more stark contrast than  when it comes to infrastructure. Labor's plan to invest  according to cost benefit analysis, according to advice  from Infrastructure Australia, in projects such as this,  as well as road projects. The Coalition's plan that  dismisses any funding for public transport  whatsoever. What that does is consign people to  spending more time in their cars than at home with  their families and their kids, or in their work places.  What that does is reject the Infrastructure Australia  model.    

 So at the next election on September 7, anyone who  supports funding for urban public transport should  vote Labor. It is one of the real differences at this  election, along with the very different plans for what  we need with the National Broadband Network as  opposed to the Opposition's flawed fraud-band plan.  Infrastructure will be a key at this election. Public  transport is front and centre when it comes to the  differences between the Government and the  Coalition and I don't understand the intransience, one  of Mr Abbott's heroes, Margaret Thatcher, said that if  you find yourself on a bus at the age of 27, you can  consider your life to be a failure. Well I don't have that  elitist view and I understand that public transport is  important in our cities, the Prime Minister understands  it and so does every Labor candidate.     

 PM:                                         Just to conclude, before taking questions, the 

 bottom line is this - our new approach to the future is  an NBN for the future, the other lot are saying they  will disconnect the NBN. Our approach, the new  approach to the future is we, as an Australian  Government will help invest in our major cities urban  transport needs, what they are saying is that they  won't. There is a clear contrast in our approaches to  this and I believe the Australian people will think very  carefully about who they trust, not just with the future  management of our economy, which I have touched  on this morning, but also the delivery of the  infrastructure we need for the future, new 

 infrastructure for Australia's new needs. Over to you  folks. 

 

 JOURNALIST:                     Mr Abbott says that if interest rates are cut this  afternoon by the Reserve Bank that the economy will  be in much more trouble than the Government is  prepared to admit. Would you like to respond to that  and also given we probably won't get to talk to you  after the interest rate decision, could you tell us what  you think an interest rate cut would mean?  

 

 PM:                                         Nice one Sid. The Reserve Bank is an independent 

 institution and their decision is appropriately  independent for them. We have been well served by  the Reserve Bank through the hardest times of the  Global Financial Crisis and they have calibrated  interest rates according to not just the state of the  Australian domestic economy but international  economic developments as well. The alternative  Treasurer to give a public lecture to the Reserve Bank  yesterday, again suggests on fundamental questions  of economic management they are in a shambles.     

 On the question of Mr Abbott's comments that you  just referred to, what he needs to understand is that  all Australian families, working families in particular,  are under cost of living pressures. Under this  Government, through the independent decisions of  the Reserve Bank, we have had interest rates low by  historical standards. To give you a practical example,  if you are on a $300,000 mortgage, right now you are  paying $5,500 a year less than what you were back in  2006. That means a lot for average families. For Mr  Abbott or Mr Hockey to come out and say that any  such interest rate cut in the future, if it were to occur,  is somehow bad, just shows you how out of touch  they are with the pressures faced by Australian  families.    

 JOURNALIST:                     On that, can you promise that rates will always be  lower under a Labor Government than they would  under the Coalition and Mr Albanese to you, you’ve  about the NBN - who will be building it in WA and SA  now that the company has pulled out?     

 PM:                                         Let me just go to your first question. One of the 

 great things about this country and the management  of its economy is that you have independent  institutions like the Reserve Bank. Therefore, for any  politician to stand up, whether it was Mr Howard's  false claim years ago, or any other such claim today  about projections about future interest rates is just  economically irresponsible. You know that, everybody  knows that. What we're concerned about is cost of  living pressures in the real world on families. Number  one, making sure our interest rates are as low as  possible.     

 I said before $5,500 a year less for an average  mortgage of $300,000. Secondly, basic things like us  paying the School Kids Bonus. We are providing that  to help people out. They will rip it away. Thirdly, the  National Broadband Network, we will connect it to  peoples' homes and businesses for free. They will  take it to a postbox out on the road and then charge  you up to $3,000 to connect it to your house. Add all  those together, that is what adds up to the bottom  line. I don't believe Mr Abbott's been faintly sensitive  to the real cost of living pressures faced by families.  

 

 DPM:                                      NBN, in terms of the arrangements, of course, are 

 commercial arrangements between NBNCo and  contractors. There are 10 major construction  companies rolling out the NBN as we speak. It is not  just meeting its targets but it is meeting them on  budget. In terms of the specifics of today's report, the  fact is that contracts come to an end and when they  come to an end you get a new contractor. That is  what happens and in terms of South Australia, there  has been a major contract issued with a South  Australia company. In Western Australia it is Downer  have signed up a contract. The existing company  Syntheo has been engaged in the process until early  2014.  

 

 Just yesterday, a major contract was extended  between NBNCo and a particular company. Those  are all commercial decisions. The NBNCo is vital for  Australia's future. There are some in the Coalition and  some it would appear in the media who seem intent  on talking Australia down and talking down the future 

 which the NBN represents. People need to look at  what those interests are but for the national interest,  the NBN is absolutely vital, the idea that we are  having a debate in 2013 about whether fibre to the  home is better than fibre to the fridge on the corner  and copper to the home is quite frankly laughable.  That is the debate, in terms of copper versus fibre,  that might have been settled when copper was better  value than iron wire back in 1913. In 2013, it is fibre  and when it comes to the NBN, we need to do it once,  do it right, and we need to do it with fibre. That is what  NBNCo is doing.    

 PM:                                         Just on NBN, one final thought by the way. Albo 

 put out a ripper Tweet this morning in response to Mr  Murdoch's observations on the NBN. I have just  added my voice to Albo's Tweet. The bottom line is,  this is a free country, Mr Murdoch is entitled to his  point of view. He says that we can't afford to have a  National Broadband Network which delivers fibre to  the home and fibre to the business premises of  Australians. Remarkably that seems to be the same  policy of Mr Abbott's as well. It is a strange  coincidence of interest there.  

 

 We have a different view. The National Broadband  Network is there for all Australians and we will not  have a divide between rich people and poor people,  remote areas and inner city areas. We want to have  fibre optic cable to lift peoples' lives, to add  productivity right across the country and we stand by  our policy and are proud of it.  

 

 JOURNALIST:                     Australia's AAA credit rating from the three major  agencies has been a major element of your argument  establishing your Government's credibility, will you  guarantee a AAA credit rating throughout the course  of the next term, and secondly do you think voters in  Dobell will cop a fly in candidate like Andrew  Charlton?    

 PM:                                         The first thing I would say - it is like my response to 

 the question on the Reserve Bank and the  independence of the Reserve Bank, the credit  companies make their independent assessments all  the time. What I can say to you is the fact this 

 Government has among the lowest net debt to GDP  ratios of any countries in the world is not because we  wished it to be such, it is because we have been very  attentive to the needs of the economy and bringing  back the budget to surplus over time. You look at their  commentary on that.     

 Secondly, you look at our budget deficit as a  proportion of GDP, again one of the lowest around,  compared with what you see in Europe and  elsewhere, bringing the budget back to surplus over  time. Independent decisions will be taken by ratings  agencies in the future that’s as it should be. As far as  Dobell is concerned, I am sure we will have a first-class candidate in Dobell by the time nominations  close. 

 

 JOURNALIST:                     On your comments just then about Mr Murdoch, do  you subscribe to the theory that he sees the NBN as a  threat to his business or if not, why do you think he is  so passionately running this campaign to have you  thrown out? What's happened to the relationship  between you and Mr Murdoch?  

 

 PM:                                         Well Mr Murdoch is entitled to his view. It is a 

 democracy, it is a free press. He owns 70% of the  newspapers in this country, some of whom are  represented here by fine journalists. But he owns 70%  of them. Secondly, I think he's made it fairly clear and  through one of his editors the other day that he  doesn't really like us and would like to give us the  heave-ho and would like to get rid of us and get his  mate Mr Abbott in. It is a free country. He can do that  if that is what he wishes. He has also been very blunt  in what he said on Twitter, through his own direct  statements. I just referred to one on the NBN.     

 The bottom line is - it is for others to ask the question  why Mr Murdoch really doesn't want the National  Broadband Network to be connected to everyone's  homes and everyone’s small business premises, does  he sense it represents a commercial challenge to  Foxtel which is a major cash cow for his company or  not?     

 But I’d rather hear from him on those questions or  hear from his corporation. As I said in terms of his  views and his determination to see Mr Abbott elected  as Prime Minister and his determination to see the  end of myself, it is a free country. He is entitled to  those views. I am sure he sees it with crystal clear  clarity all the way from the United States. 

 

 JOURNALIST:                     (inaudible) own 70% of the newspapers. Are you  saying he shouldn't have that presence?     

 PM:                                         I am just describing a fact. He operates under the 

 laws of this country. One of our great freedoms is  freedom of the press and he operates under the entire  media diversity laws of this country as well. And so  70% of the newspapers are owned by him. Through  his statements made directly he has said he wants Mr  Abbott as Prime Minister and he doesn't want us to  continue in Government. That is his right to free  speech. He is directly opposed our plan for the  National Broadband Network and he says it should  not be provided free to peoples' homes and to  peoples’ small businesses. That is a matter for him.  We have a different view. I noticed his view is  identical to Mr Abbott's view.     

 JOURNALIST:                     Will you repay the money that the foundation paid for  your trip to Germany last year given they're involved in cigarette manufacturing?     

 PM:                                         If you think, Latika, that someone like myself, then 

 as a backbencher travelling overseas to a conference  hosted by a foundation should have prior knowledge  as to where a foundation, a German public interest  foundation may derive its funding from - you just don't  know those things. I didn't know it at the time. Latike -  for you to draw by inference a moral comparison  between attending an international conference funded  by an international foundation which for the purposes  of that conference or more generally, has a range of  funding sources with the Liberal Party in 2013 taking  direct campaign donations worth millions of dollars to  fund the political advertisements on the air waves  today, then you're dead wrong. It is a fundamentally  different principle.    

 JOURNALIST:                     Prime Minister, you have said Mr Murdoch owns  70% of the newspapers and print media in the company -    

 PM:                                         Which organisation are you from Sid?  

 

 

 JOURNALIST:                     The Australian' owned by the Murdoch Government.  The question that leaves open is do you have any plans to change the media  laws if Labor is re-elected?     

 PM:                                         We have no such plans at all because we assume 

 all independent players in the Australian media  market will participate within the law, exercise their  freedom of speech as Mr Murdoch is consistently  doing through the pages of your newspaper and  others. 

 

 JOURNALIST:                     The Government of Nauru has said they won't  resettle refugees in that country. Is that completely at  opposites with what was announced on Saturday and  what is your understanding of what refugees will be  allowed to do on Nauru?  

 

 PM:                                         The language that we agreed with the Government 

 of Nauru, in the statement we made here in Brisbane  last Saturday, was that a limited number of people will  be allowed to settle and reside there. That is the  language which exists within their own traditions. That  is what we agreed on and made public at the time.  Nothing has changed since.     

 JOURNALIST:                     Nauru is saying that that can't happen permanently.  Is there a misunderstanding?     

 PM:                                         No, we said they could settle and reside. Nauru's 

 experience of this is that as I am advised by the  Immigration Minister is that in the past various people  have come to settle and reside in Nauru and have  ended up staying for 20 years. They don't have a  category of permanent residency as we do under our  immigration law. When they say settle and reside,  they are drawing on their own traditions, it is the  language we used on the day and that is the  language which will be the subject of the  implementation of this agreement.  Hey mate I can 

 barely see you behind that spotlight. What happened 

 to Tony Abbott at your debate last night, where did he  go?     

 JOURNALIST:                     That didn't happen. 

 

 PM:                                         Did you ask him why he didn't front?  

 

 JOURNALIST:                     I believe he didn't attend in the end.     

 PM:                                         That was unfortunate.  

 

 JOURNALIST:                     We hope to host another one during the election.    

 PM:                                         I have just been to a community debate with the 

 Liberal candidate for Griffith, I’ve been there with the  Green candidate and Clive Palmer’s candidate as  well. Then, having an hour and a half of that, an hour  on the radio with all four candidates again. You know  something, the life blood of democracy, apart from a  free speech and free press and a balanced public  political debate is to ensure that those who want to  put up their hands for public office get to have a say  and put their ideas in contests against others. That’s  why you and the media are so legitimately active. I did  that at a local level this morning with every local  candidate. It is the right thing to do. Why is this that  the Prime Minister of Australia can happily debate his  Liberal candidate but the bloke who wants to be  Prime Minister of Australia refuses to debate. I don't  get that? I just really don’t get it.     

 JOURNALIST:                     Chris Bowen wrote govern alone or not at all, Tony  Abbott appears to have adopted that as his mantra-     

 PM:                                         I answered that yesterday by saying - I was talking 

 to Albo about that. He has some good local stuff on this one, it is great.     

 DPM:                                      I was very interested by Mr Abbott's comments. I 

 am a candidate in Graynler. It is the number one  target according to the Greens on their website.  Guess what - the Liberal Party has given preferences  to the Greens in every single election in Graynler.  Every single time they have campaigned there. If  they're fair dinkum, the only reason why you have  people like Adam Bandt in Parliament and why the  Greens think they can win that seat is because the  Liberals give them preferences.  

 

 Adam Bandt was put into the House of  Representatives by Tony Abbott at the 2010 election.  This election he is trying to put Adam Bandt back and  trying to put Hall Greenland who is a fair way to the  left of Adam Bandt, he probably makes Adam Bant  look like a National Party Member. Nonetheless, in  spite of Hall's support for the boycott and sanctions  campaign against Israel, in spite of the fact that he  describes Bob Brown as Liberals on bicycles in the  Canberra leadership, they won't give a commitment  not to give them preferences.  

 

 I say to Tony Abbott, get fair dinkum - don't put cross  benchers into Parliament if that is your real view.    

 PM:                                         Folks, having said all of that I think it’s about time 

 to zip. We’ve given it a fair old race around the racecourse.      

 JOURNALIST:                     The Liberal candidate of Greenway had a bit of  trouble getting on top of his brief. How confident are  you on whether your candidates are up to speed on  Labor Party policy?  

 

 PM:                                         You know something - candidates and campaigns 

 are a rolling challenge. I understand the Liberal  candidate in Greenway had a few challenges  yesterday. I am sure some of ours will at some stage  or another. That is life in an election campaign. If  you’ve been through as many as I have you’ve seen  anything can happen. The core thing is this - what we  have seen on the question of the alternative  government today is nothing short of a shambles on  economic policy. Fundamental differences between  the alternative Prime Minister and the alternative  Treasurer on interest rates, fundamental differences  between the alternative Prime Minister and the  alternative Treasurer on the budget bottom line for  their own party. I think that speaks volumes in terms  of their fitness for office. Thanks folks.
