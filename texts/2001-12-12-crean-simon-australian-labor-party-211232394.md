 STATEMENT BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THE HON SIMON CREAN MP

 CABINET LEAK EXPOSES PM’S DECEIT ON PACIFIC SOLUTION

 The Prime Minister has today been caught red-handed having deliberately mislead the Australian people, with the leaking of top-secret cabinet advice on the cost of the “Pacific Solution” for asylum seekers.

 According to information obtained by the ABC, a budget of $400 - $500 million for the “Pacific solution” was approved by Cabinet in September when Nauru first agreed to house and process asylum seekers.

 Yet a month after this, Mr Howard insisted he did not know the cost of the operation.

 MITCHELL: Is it correct that is was costing $600,000 a day to keep the Manoora there?

 PRIME MINISTER: I’d have to check the exact figure but it’s not cheap.

 MITCHELL: Do you know what the overall cost of the…

 PRIME MINISTER: No, I don’t, it’s expensive.

 Neil Mitchell, 3AW 5/10/2001

 Mr Howard clearly knew the full cost of the “Pacific Solution” when he made these comments, but decided to deceive voters by deliberately hiding this information.

 It confirms the “Pacific Solution” was only ever a solution to get the government past November 10, and is not a long-term answer to the problem of asylum seekers.
