   Media Release H65/2003 - 21 May 2003

 

 Minister Launches Plan of Action for Migrants and Refugees in Victoria

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave said today a new  Integrated Settlement Plan for Victoria will link and improve services available to migrants  settling in Australia.

 Mr Hardgrave was speaking at the first regional meeting of the Victorian Settlement Planning  Committee, in Shepparton.

 He said the plan meant migrants would have access to settlement services that were  effective, coordinated, and significantly assisted their transition into Australian society. 

 "Shepparton is the perfect location to discuss settlement issues, as it's a great example of  Australia's regional centres continuing to welcome migrants and refugees into their  communities, and embracing the benefits of diversity," Mr Hardgrave said.

 The Victorian Settlement Planning Committee (VSPC), a partnership between community  based agencies and government, developed the Integrated Settlement Plan for Victoria  2003-2005 (ISP).

 "Having a working guide helps to ensure that the work of community organisations and  government agencies is coordinated so that there is no duplication of effort, or omission of  services," Mr Hardgrave said.

 "Australia's settlement programs are renowned throughout the world. The Government sees  these programs as an important investment that contributes to each person's ability to  participate fully in our multicultural society, realise their personal aspirations, and benefit  Australia," the Minister said.

 "I commend the community and in particular the Committee for their excellent and effective  planning."

 Shepparton showcases multicultural initiatives

 While in Shepparton, the Minister met with local government officials, and industry and  community representatives to discuss multicultural issues.

 "It is fantastic to see the community focusing on important issues surrounding multicultural  affairs," Mr Hardgrave said. 

 The Federal Member for Murray, Dr Sharman Stone, accompanied the Minister during his  visit to the Goulburn Valley and showed the diversity of the region to the Minister first hand. 

 "As the 'food basket' of Australia, Shepparton is a vital part of Australia's economy. Many  migrants in the region gain work in the agricultural industry," Dr Stone said. 

 Dr Stone said Minister Hardgrave also visited the Wilmot Road Primary School, officiated at  a citizenship ceremony and finally ended his evening at the Italian Club in Tatura.

 Mr Hardgrave conferred Australian citizenship on 15 candidates in a citizenship ceremony,  at the Shepparton Art Gallery.

 "The candidates from Cyprus, Iraq, Italy, Kuwait, South Africa, the United Kingdom, Turkey  and New Zealand represent the success of the Federal Government's regional migration  initiatives," Mr Hardgrave said.

 The Minister said that government policy sought to influence the decisions of migrants about  where they lived in an effort to improve the movement of migrants away from cities into  regional areas to meet skill shortages.

 Mr Hardgrave also presented Diploma of Interpreting Certificates to 10 recent graduates,  who successfully completed a Diploma of Interpreting Course at Shepparton TAFE.
