 Reconsideration of East Timorese Caseload 

 VPS 069/2005

 Minister for Immigration, Amanda Vanstone, announced today she has reconsidered the cases of 53 East Timorese asylum seekers.

 ‘A significant number of these asylum seekers submitted new and substantial information in support of their intervention requests following my  announcement of 19 May, including evidence of a high level of community integration and support.

 ‘As a result, I have written to 47 people asking them to complete relevant health and character checks so a final decision on whether to grant a  permanent visa in their cases can be made,’ the Minister said.

 ‘The intervention process is usually a two-stage process.

 ‘Most had previously been refused at ‘stage one’ and it is only prudent that stage two health and character checks either be carried out or updated  before a final decision on whether to grant a permanent visa is made. 

 This includes some individuals where their cases were refused on character grounds. There may be updated information in these cases that should  be taken into consideration, such as participation in rehabilitation programmes.

 ‘I would not expect that in every of the 47 cases that a visa will be granted.

 ‘I have confirmed previous decisions to decline to intervene and grant visas to the remaining 6 other individuals.

 Those people for whose previous decisions was not to intervene will again be offered the Government’s reintegration package to assist them to  return to East Timor. They will have a further 28 days to decide if they wish to accept the offer.

 As always, each case has been judged on its individual merits.
