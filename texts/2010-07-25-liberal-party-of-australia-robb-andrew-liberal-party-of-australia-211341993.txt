 Abbott wins debate with a clear plan while Gillard fudges 

 25/07/10  

 Tony Abbott won the debate because he was the only Leader to set out clear plans for  the future. 

 He won all the major issues - the economic questions, cost of living, boat people,  mining tax and climate change. 

 He made the most of the opportunity. 

 The factions who installed Julia Gillard would be very disappointed. 

 Julia Gillard did not perform as well as they thought she would. 

 She equivocated bluffed and stalled, and again failed to give clear answers to the  Australian people. 

 She performed badly on climate change, Kevin Rudd’s execution, Nauru and debt,  and she failed to outline her plans for the future. We still don’t know what she stands  for. 

 Tony Abbott was more authentic and delivered his messages much more effectively.
