  Media Release

  

  DUNCAN KERR MP

  SHADOW MINISTER FOR JUSTICE & CUSTOMS

  

 13 October 99

  

  Another boat of illegal immigrants - 

  Another failure for Ruddock and Vanstone on 
border protection

  

  Yesterday’s landing in Western Australia of a boat carrying 116 
illeg al immigrants is further proof that the Government’s attempted 
measures to introduce draconian laws is just a smokescreen given their 
repeated failures on coastal surveillance and border protection, Shadow 
Justice and Customs Minister, Duncan Kerr, said today.

  

 “Mr Ruddock’s smokescreen seems to be an attempt 
to hide the fact that the Government is not properly addressing the 
issue of border protection,” Mr Kerr said.

  

 “Australia has 11 million square kilometres of ocean 
to monitor. But the fact remains - we haven’t got the ‘cop on the 
beat’ with proper resources and proper coordination to do the task 
the Australian public expects.”

  

 Mr Kerr said the Government’s Border Protection 
Legislation Bill is due to be debated in the Parliament next week.

  

 “While this Bill recognises the need for Australia 
to be able to enforce our maritime laws, the Government does not have 
an adequate plan for coastal surveillance,” Mr Kerr said.

  

 “Australia has this year had a record number of 
boat people, with 56 boats carrying 1498 people, compared with 13 boats 
and 157 people in 1997/98.

  

 “When will Mr Ruddock and Senator Vanstone admit 
their policy failings on this issue?

  

 “This landing is exactly the sort of outcome we 
expect from their ad hoc approach to border protection.

  

 “There is no one agency in Australia with overall 
responsibility for our maritime jurisdiction.

  

 “Labor believes the Government has failed to properly 
examine the option of an Australian Coastguard. We need an integrated 
strategy.”
