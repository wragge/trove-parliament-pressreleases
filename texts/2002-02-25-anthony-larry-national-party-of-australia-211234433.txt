 NATIONAL YOUTH ROUNDTABLE 2002 MEMBERS

 The 50 young Australians chosen as members of the fourth National Youth Roundtable were announced today by Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Larry Anthony.

 "The members of Roundtable 2002 are a remarkable group of young people. They reflect the diversity of experiences and backgrounds found in the Australian community.

 "There was strong interest from young people in every state and territory. Those selected for the Roundtable will bring very wide-ranging knowledge and experiences to the table.

 "Roundtable participants will come from all over Australia, such as Bronte in Sydney and the Cocos Islands off Western Australia to represent to Government the issues that concern them.

 "They include high school students and those in tertiary study of medicine, marine biology, law, fine arts, communications and social sciences. There is also an apprentice carpenter, a policy officer in industrial relations, a youth worker in drama and dance and a motivational speaker.

 "Roundtable members will begin orientation workshops over the next two weeks and will come together for the first of two Roundtable meetings in Canberra on 18 March 2002.

 "The National Youth Roundtable was established by the Coalition Government in 1999 to give Australians aged from 15 to 24 the forum to put their views to Government," Mr Anthony said.
