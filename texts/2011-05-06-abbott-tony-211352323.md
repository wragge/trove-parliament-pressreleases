 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH   

 6 May 2011   

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR,  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW,   ADELAIDE 

 

 Subjects: Julia Gillard’s carbon tax; Julia Gillard’s latest backflip; border protection; budget.   

 E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It’s good to be here at Vili’s. Vili’s is a great Adelaide institution. It’s been good to walk around the factory,  talk to some of the staff and to sample some of the product. The point I’ve been making is that every year  Vili’s uses about $500,000 worth of power, gas and electricity, and that cost is going to go up massively  under Julia Gillard’s carbon tax. There’ll be about a $100,000 a year hit on Vili’s power bills under the  carbon tax and that obviously damages the profitability of this iconic Australian business.    

 The whole point of this carbon tax is that it will drive up the cost of everything and it will jeopardise jobs  everywhere and that’s the message that I think needs to be understood obviously by the Australian people  but in particular by the people who are suppose to represent the workers of Australia, and I call on the union  movement everywhere to stand up for their workers’ jobs and their members’ cost of living and stop making  excuses for a bad Government. I call on the state Labor premiers, in particular the Premier of this state,  South Australia, to stand up for the interests of his state and stop making excuses for a bad federal  Government.    

 This is my second visit to South Australia in the last week. My other visit was to Whyalla. Whyalla and Port  Pirie will, according to at least one union official, be wiped off the map by the carbon tax and I call on Mike  Rann to say where he stands on the future of Whyalla and Port Pirie. Why isn’t he standing up for the  workers and the people of those towns, rather than making excuses for a bad Government and its toxic tax?    

 Now, there are a couple of other issues around this morning, in particular the fact that the Government has  now admitted that its border protection policies have completely, utterly and absolutely failed. Their  attempts to reopen the Manus offshore detention centre, a centre that was demonised by Labor when it was  in opposition is a stunning admission of defeat by this Government.    

 It’s also of course yet another backflip. We’ve now seen three big backflips since the election. There was the  hospital backflip where they gave up on the GST grab, there’s the carbon tax backflip, obviously, and now  you’ve got the East Timor backflip - just another example of the way this Government is untrustworthy and  incompetent, a Government that simply can’t be trust to keep its commitments.

 QUESTION:    

 Is the solution viable though? Is it a good option to go to Manus Island?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 On its own, it certainly isn’t going to stop the boats and it certainly isn’t going to stop the protests inside the  detention centres. The Prime Minister should immediately pick up the phone to the President of Nauru.  Kevin Rudd had the common sense to talk to Michael Somare. Julia Gillard should now pick up the phone to  the President of Nauru. The Nauru centre is about three times the size as the Manus one. If it’s good to have  the Manus centre re-operational, it’s even better to have the Nauru centre operational. She should swallow  her pride and pick up the phone to the President of Nauru today.    

 QUESTION:    

 PNG is a signatory to the international agreement on refugees but Nauru is not, so surely PNG would be a  better option?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well again, I am sure, based on the conversations that the Coalition has been having with Nauru, that if that  was what it took to reopen the centre of Nauru they would sign the convention.    

 QUESTION:    

 Remarks attributed to Joe Hockey yesterday are that he believes you could have had the budget back into  surplus this year. I might ask you [inaudible]    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, this is a try-on from the Government. This is a Government which is so hopeless that they now expect  the Coalition to tell them what to do on Tuesday night. Now, it’s Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan’s budget.  They’ve got to get it right. We’ll tell Australia on Thursday night of next week what our vision is for the  future.    

 QUESTION:    

 So is Mr Hockey being a bit hasty?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 No, no, no. We said at the last election that we could reduce the budget bottom line, improve the budget  bottom line by about $11 billion over the forward estimates period. We said at the last election and we  provided the figures to back it up that we could improve the debt situation by $30 billion over the forward  estimates period.  We’ve got the runs on the board when it comes to fiscal responsibility and it’s now up to  the Government to show that it isn’t completely incompetent and untrustworthy.    

 QUESTION:    

 Would any jobs be lost in the process, then?

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 We make no bones about the fact that we think that you can slim down the public service. There are now  20,000 more Commonwealth public sector employees than there were in December 2007. We said that we  would wind back some of that increase.    

 QUESTION:    

 I might just go onto Whyalla, on the basis of your contemplations about it being wiped off the map and  becoming a ghost town. I think a follow up remark was that politicians come and go but Whyalla remains  regardless. I mean, is that very helpful to come to South Australia and that’s, you know, depressed the town  of Whyalla?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 The point I make is that this was the statement of the South Australian head of the Australian Workers’  Union, so people who’ve got a problem should take it up first and foremost with the head of the AWU, but  the further point I make is that I want to protect Whyalla. The way to protect Whyalla is not to have a carbon  tax. Now, if someone wants to explain to me how Whyalla is going to flourish without the steel industry, by  all means, let’s hear the explanation but the best way to guarantee the future of Whyalla is not to have a  carbon tax. I guarantee there’ll be no carbon tax under the Coalition. All we know from the Prime Minister  is that having said before the election there will be no carbon tax, now there will be and that is very, very  bad news for the people of Whyalla, Port Pirie, for South Australia generally which is why I say to Premier  Rann, stop making excuses for a bad Government, stand up for the people of Whyalla and Port Pirie and the  economic future of South Australia by rejecting this toxic tax.    

 QUESTION:    

 I think Mr Rann did say any turnover from the tax, the majority should go back to industry.    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 And as the people who actually understand the steel industry have made crystal clear, the Government  doesn’t know what it’s talking about. There was the Treasurer last week scoffing at the impact of a carbon  tax on the steel industry and Paul O’Malley from BlueScope said the next day that the Government did not  know what it was talking about. The impact of the carbon tax on his business alone could be up to $1 billion  over just eight years. A $1 billion hit on the bottom line over just eight years. So you’ve got a Prime  Minister who can’t explain it, you’ve got a Treasurer who doesn’t understand it, you’ve got Labor premiers  in Queensland and Tasmania who don’t really support it, so why should any Australian want this toxic tax? I  call on Premier Mike Rann again to stand up for the people of South Australia and to stop making excuses  for a bad federal Government.   

 QUESTION:    

 One more if I may, Leader, do you support mandatory betting limits on pokies?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, I gather that the parliamentary report has made some recommendations. As I understand it, if these  recommendations were adopted, it wouldn’t stop problem gambling but it would impose enormous costs on  clubs and pubs. The other point I make is that if the Government were to adopt these recommendations it  would not meet the commitments that the Prime Minister gave to Andrew Wilkie after the election. She gave  Andrew Wilkie a categoric commitment that there would be mandatory pre-commitment on all poker  machines by 2014 and that’s not what this report is recommending.

 QUESTION:    

 Do you feel it should also target online gambling now though?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 One of the whole difficulties with stopping problem gambling by attacking poker machines is that problem  gamblers don’t just go to the pokies. Problem gamblers, they gamble in a whole range of ways, they gamble  in casinos and increasingly they gamble online and any attack on problem gambling that doesn’t also deal  with online gambling will be completely ineffectual.    

 QUESTION:    

 On a slightly different topic, have you heard about the missing Queenscliff Surf Life Saving Club shark  bell?    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I have had a sketchy report and obviously it would be good for that bell to go back to its home.    

 QUESTION:    

 Do you feel it could be a bit tough getting that back from the Philippines though?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, I guess the question is, who’s got it and how did he get it? Now, I think the question is if the bell has  been stolen, well then there’s law enforcement procedures. If the bell has been got legitimately well, then  let’s get it back legitimately.    

 Thank you.
