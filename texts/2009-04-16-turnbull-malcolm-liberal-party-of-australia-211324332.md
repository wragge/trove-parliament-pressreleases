 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. MALCOLM TURNBULL MP  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  BRISBANE 

 

 Subjects: Tragic explosion on asylum seekers’ vessel; Rudd’s new attempt at alcopops tax grab.   

 E&OE……………………………………………………………………………………………………….…..   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 The explosion today on the asylum seekers’ vessel off the coast of Western Australia is a terrible tragedy.  On behalf of the Opposition I send our condolences to the families of those who’ve been killed and our  deepest sympathies to those that have been injured. We are particularly concerned to hear reports that  Australian servicemen and women have been injured in this explosion. Our ADF personnel put their lives at  risk in our service and their injuries today and the deaths on the asylum seekers’ vessel remind us of how  dangerous, how very, very dangerous this pernicious business of people smuggling is. It puts lives at risk,  the lives of those that venture in the boats and, as we can see, the lives of Australian servicemen and  servicewomen who are involved in intercepting or protecting these vessels. That is why everything must be  done, every measure must be undertaken to discourage and prevent this very pernicious business of people  smuggling. It is a dangerous, unlawful and very, very, very life threatening business. Every measure must be  undertaken to ensure that it does not continue.   

 QUESTION:   

 We have seen an increase in recent months with boat people arriving near our shores. Is the Rudd  Government’s policies doing enough to discourage boat people?   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 Look on a day with such a tragic event as this, I don’t wish to make political points but I’d simply say this  that yes, there has been an increase in people smuggling. It’s a matter of very real concern. We’ve raised it  repeatedly. People smuggling is a very dangerous business. We do no service to anybody by being seen to  be more accommodating or more receptive to people smuggling. It is vital that Australia is seen to be and is  resolute in its opposition to people smuggling. We can see it puts the lives of many people at risk, not just  those in these often very unseaworthy vessels but the lives of brave Australians who are doing their duty in  our service, wearing our uniform, under our flag on the open seas - their lives are put at risk too.

 QUESTION:   

 Sharman Stone, your Immigration Spokesperson, has today said, she has criticised the Rudd Government’s  policies saying that it is making it more encouraging for boat people to come here. I mean, do your support  her comments?    

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 We’ve made the observation in the past and I just don’t want to labour the political point today but the Rudd  Government has made changes to the rules and the procedures dealing with unlawful, well asylum seekers  of the kind we’re talking about today, of people smuggling and there is no doubt that the impression has  been created that we are more accommodating or taking a less hard line towards people smuggling than we  had in the past. There has been a significant increase in people smuggling, that is a very bad thing, and we  must make sure that every policy is focused on reducing and, where at all possible, completely eliminating  this pernicious trade of people smuggling.   

 QUESTION:   

 On the issue of alcopops, do you think the Federal Government could be planning to use this issue to call a  double dissolution election?   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 Well, the Rudd Government will do anything it can to distract public attention from the failure of its  economic policies.  It has given away $23 billion in four months in cash splashes - $23 billion.  It said that  the December cash splash would create 75,000 jobs.  There’s no evidence it’s created one job.  Jobs  continue to be lost.  Our economy continues to go into reverse.  So the Rudd Government’s economic  policies are failing.  We have been calling for positive alternatives.  We seek to engage with the  Government.  We’ve asked the Government to sit down with us and discuss positive alternatives which will  provide real stimulus, to small business in particular, to create employment and keep Australians on the  payroll.   The Government has declined to talk to us and it wants to create one distraction after another.  As  far as the point about double dissolutions is concerned, from what we’ve been told by the Health Minister,  the bill she’s proposing to introduce is a completely different bill from the one that was rejected by the  Senate previously and so the double dissolution point doesn’t arise.   

 QUESTION:   

 It’s been voted down once already though, so why do you think they’re bringing this back at all?   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 Well the Government is determined to raise, presumably, the Government is determined to raise I think $1.6  billion from this new tax.  The alcopops tax has got nothing to do with health measures.  It’s all about  raising revenue.     

 The Government’s claim that it’s about a campaign against binge-drinking is completely hypocritical.  If the  Government was serious about that it would be devoting the revenue from the tax to health campaigns to  raise awareness, education, to discourage people from engaging in dangerous levels of drinking.  This is just  a revenue grab - nothing more or less.   

 QUESTION:   

 How do you think the Coalition would go if you went to the polls?

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 Well, I’m very much focused on the issues of today if you don’t mind, okay.  Thanks very much.
