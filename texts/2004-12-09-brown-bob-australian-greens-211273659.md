 Rudd Gets Off Bike Over Tibet 

 9th December  2004 

 

 Labor joined the government in the Senate this morning to vote down  the following congratulatory motion moved by Greens Senator Bob  Brown.    

 That the Senate noting that 10 December is International Human  Rights Day, congratulates Mr Brian Summerfield who is celebrating the  day in Melbourne by completing a bike ride around Australia during  which he raised hundreds of dollars for Tibetan refugees and promoted  the cause of a free Tibet.    

 “This is a precious ‘never mention Tibet’ kowtowing to Beijing from  Labor as well as the government,” Senator Brown said.    

 “Kevin Rudd has got off his made in China bike to block a simple  vote of congratulations to an Australian who has gone a long way for  the Tibetan people,” Senator Brown said.
