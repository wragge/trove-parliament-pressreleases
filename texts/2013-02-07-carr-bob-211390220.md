 Doorstop interview 

 Transcript, E&OE, proof only 

 7 February 2013 

 BOB CARR: Sorry to keep you waiting, but there was a division in the  Senate. I know you'll understand. 

 Australia's got sanctions in place against Zimbabwe and I'm  announcing today the peeling back of these sanctions in three stages  as the country meets our benchmarks for reinstatement of  democracy. The benchmarks are these: the settings of a date for a  constitutional referendum, a peaceful and credible constitutional  referendum being held; and third, free and fair elections taking place  and a democratically-elected government taking office. So we will, in  response to these three benchmarks being reached, peel back our  sanctions which include travel and financial restrictions against 153  individuals in the regime, in the Government, and four entities, an  arms embargo and prohibition on defence links. 

 Now, it would give me enormous satisfaction to see a reinstatement  of normal relations with Zimbabwe. It means we can reach out and  talk to this country and its rulers in a way we couldn't when we were  horrified by the departures from democratic norms that marked its 

 recent history. We're moving in line with the EU and other like-minded nations. It's a three-stage road map to see sanctions  removed in response to progress towards democracy. 

 QUESTION: Minister, [indistinct] now the takings from the  Government of Zimbabwe that they're prepared to meet these -  how firm are the indications that they're prepared to meet all these  conditions? 

 BOB CARR: Well, we're doing it because of talks held with the Prime  Minister on his visit here in July 2012. So he knows what our desire is  and he's told us and Zimbabwean diplomats have told us that they're  committed to democratic reforms. And this seems confirmed by  what's happening in the country as reported to us by our High  Commissioner. 

 QUESTION: And what would the transition look like? I mean, would  you envisage removing the sanctions on individuals first, followed by  institutions? Is there an order for this to take place? 

 BOB CARR: We'd package it with the arms embargo and the  prohibition on defence links being removed last. 

 QUESTION: [Indistinct] time frame, any indication yet of a time  frame? 

 BOB CARR: We're eager to do it. I want normal relations with  Zimbabwe. As the political system there returns to normality we  want our diplomatic links to be normalised. Those people to people  links which are so important will be unimpeded by these restrictions.  And nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see Zimbabwe  walk in to one of those Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' Meetings  that I have the honour of chairing. 

 QUESTION: Minister, can I ask you on another issue what update you  have about the incident - the tsunami and earthquake with the  Solomons yesterday? Do you have any - a firm indication on the  death toll, and what's the status in terms of Australians in that  region? 

 BOB CARR: Yeah, it's been clarified that there've been six deaths,  and this is tragic. You think of people in these poor communities,  these villages, going about their lives being struck without warning  and their families bereaved. We extend our condolences on what has  happened to the Government and to the people of the Solomon  Islands. We're ready to offer assistance which would include  emergency food and shelter, medical supplies, and help with  reconstruction. But specifics will await discussions with the  Government of the Solomons. And they, I believe, are still measuring  the extent of the destructive force of the tsunami and the  earthquake that preceded it. 

 QUESTION: Senator Carr, is there anything you can tell us about the  Bulgarian terrorism case? Have you spoken with your Bulgarian  counterpart… 

 BOB CARR: No I haven't. As soon as I've got more information, I'll  seek an update today, I'll share it with you. 

 QUESTION: Senator, just back on Zimbabwe, the political situation  there is still quite unstable. How confident are you that Zimbabwe  will actually be able to meet the criteria you set out, given that they  want to, but will they be able to do it? 

 BOB CARR: I'm not going to make assumptions about what happens  within that country. But our commitment is there. Three political  benchmarks. If they meet them, in response we will take sanctions 

 away, and it begins with the date being set for a constitutional  referendum. We're in contact, through our High Commission, with  people in the political opposition, so we think we can judge the  credibility of commitments that are made. 

 QUESTION: Minister… 

 BOB CARR: As in Myanmar it's not a bad test to be guided by what  opposition forces have to say. 

 QUESTION: Minister, Julian Assange is back in the news in the UK  today. Jemima Goldsmith has - or Jemima Khan has written in the  New Statesman she was formerly a supporter of Mr Assange's and  says she still supports some of his principles, but she's describing him  as a bit of a cult figure now, saying that he's tolerating only disciples  and unwavering devotion and he's becoming an Australian L. Ron  Hubbard. I wonder what you think of those comments, and can you  tell us what is the latest on the status of Mr Assange and what  applications the Australian Government has made to get him into a  position where he can leave that embassy? 

 BOB CARR: Yeah, comments on his personal characteristics are  irrelevant to our position. He's in the Ecuadorean Embassy because  he's opted to be there in response to a win by the Swedish  authorities in the English courts. This is a dispute between him and  the Swedish authorities with the Swedish authorities getting a  decision at the English courts that he's got to go to Sweden. And he's  resisted that extradition to Sweden. Now, we've got no standing in  this. I just underline that it's got nothing to do with Wikileaks,  nothing to do with America, nothing to do with secrets or  intelligence. 

 Beyond that, all I can say is as an Australian citizen he's got our  continuing consular support, as any Australian would have, but we  don't fight court cases for Australians who are in trouble with foreign  jurisdictions. 

 QUESTION: Have you had any further talks with the United States  about the possibility that Sweden would seek to extradite him to the  United States … 

 BOB CARR: They know that we've got an interest in this and that we  want to be informed. If America had a plan to extradite him from  Sweden it would surprise me, because in the two years he lived in  the UK they didn't unveil a plan to secure his extradition from  London. And the Swedes have said, by the way, that they don't allow  extradition in cases involving intelligence or military. 

 QUESTION: Would you be concerned if the United States did seek to  extradite him? 

 BOB CARR: We'd look at that afresh, but there's no indication from  the Americans. We've indicated to the Americans we want to be  informed on that. 

 QUESTION: Minister, we read today that you've been lobbying the  EU to lift its sanctions on Myanmar. Why do you think - what's your  reasoning? Why should the EU lift its sanctions rather than the  current state of play with the… 

 BOB CARR: With the EU saying our sanctions on Myanmar are  suspended, not lifted, potential European investors who could open  factories and mines in Myanmar are deterred from doing so. We  want to see that investment, ethical investment in the country so a  poor people subject to stunting, malnutrition, unemployment, low 

 incomes, can start to move up the scale of economic development as  has happened elsewhere in Southeast Asia. 

 We want Myanmar to get on that trajectory of economic growth that  has lifted living standards and social indicators throughout Southeast  Asia. That's what we want, and the Government of Myanmar has  said it would help very much if European countries lifted, and didn't  simply leave in limbo, their sanctions. 

 QUESTION: Senator… 

 BOB CARR: So we're engaged in this, work as a friend of Myanmar. 

 QUESTION: Two of your ministerial colleagues yesterday  acknowledged that they'd received hospitality from Eddie Obeid.  Have you ever received any hospitality? 

 BOB CARR: No. 

 QUESTION: …gifts, anything in kind from Eddie Obeid before, during  or after your time as [indistinct]?… 

 BOB CARR: No. 

 QUESTION: What do you think of yesterday's - of the findings… 

 BOB CARR: I have no opinion. 

 Now, I want to say something about Tony Abbott's grand policy on  Northern Australia which is going to be funded by carving $800  million out of the foreign aid budget. This shows their recklessness  on foreign policy. An outright cut on this scale would hurt out  relations with Pacific states including Papua New Guinea, it would  damage our relations with Indonesia, it would hurt Australia's  standing in the world. 

 And now we have said, let me be up front about it, we have said  we're going to pick up, in line with OECD guidelines, the cost of  looking after refugees on Australian soil from our aid budget. That's  $375 million and it's in line with the OECD guidelines for how aid  should be spent, in other words, looking after refugees on the soil of  your country is the same as looking after them in a refugee camp in  Pakistan or Afghanistan. 

 But what Tony Abbott's doing is radically different. It's just carving  money out of the aid budget to build a medical research facility in  Australia. It would mean the Global Fund, Bill Gates' Global Fund, not  getting money to pursue its campaign against malaria or TB or AIDS  HIV. It would mean Australia not spending money in beating polio.  Australia not lending its support to getting rid of these terrible  scourges that have afflicted mankind for a long time or, in the case of  AIDS HIV, in recent decades. Now, Australia, through its aid budget,  is playing a very important role in these tasks. It couldn't any longer if  Tony Abbott's policy were locked into place. 

 QUESTION: Minister, the Government has stalled its anticipated  reaching of the Millennium Development Goals on aid. When do you  envisage you will now be able to increase again Australian aid as a  percentage of GDP? 

 BOB CARR: Well, you can't spend money you haven't got, so the  revenue - the adjustments to Australian revenues have been the  determinant here for us, and we'll reach that target as soon as we  can. But you've got to take account of how revenue has moved  because you can't borrow money to spend on aid and there's no  justification for doing that. But bear in mind that what we've done is  define, in terms of the guidelines that govern how aid money can be  spent. Tony Abbott's isn't. 

 QUESTION: Doesn't, though, the budget delay and the asylum seeker  money - hasn't that sort of opened the dam for the Coalition… 

 BOB CARR: No. 

 QUESTION: …to say, well, the Government… 

 BOB CARR: No, look, I respect your argument but what we're doing is  qualitatively different and absolutely distinct. 

 QUESTION: What would you say to Australians, though, who look at  foreign aid and say why aren't we putting that money at home and  isn't this a good idea? 

 BOB CARR: I'd say two things. It's in Australia's interest to build good  relations with countries that neighbour us. To see that Indonesians  have got the options of going to school where jihad as philosophy is  not taught, is in Australia's interest. To see that their police are  trained is in Australia's interest. To see that they're able to lift living  standards and beat diseases that hold them back from building living  standards in a prosperous democratic Indonesia, assisted along the  way by Australian aid, is absolutely in our national interest. 

 QUESTION: Senator Carr, what can you tell us about the Prime  Minister's intervention into the case of two men detained in Dubai?  And have you heard - have we heard anything back from Dubai  authorities about these guys since? 

 BOB CARR: Well, the Prime Minister very strongly made the case, as  she has before, with representatives of the Government of the UAE,  as I have done. Two Prime Ministers, three Foreign Ministers, have  made representations about the Joyce Lee case. I've spoken to the  Foreign Minister of the UAE on, I think, two occasions about it. I've  taken a continuing interest in the case. The Prime Minister pressed it  recently the head of government of the UAE. He said that the courts 

 are independent of the Government, but undertook to look at the  matters the Prime Minister raised, including delays in the case. 

 Our representations in the past - mine, hers, have been about seeing  that a decision in the Victorian Supreme Court has come to the  attention of the Emirates court, pressing the point about the length  of time this is taking and doing what we can to get some certainty for  the Joyce and Lee families. 

 QUESTION: So at this stage nothing definite, but they're going to  look at the time it's taken? Is that right? 

 BOB CARR: Yes. 

 QUESTION: Minister, you've seen… 

 BOB CARR: But, excuse me, I've just got to underline again that the  challenge here is that when Australians are charged with offences in  other jurisdictions it's not Australian law that applies. It is the law of  that country. If there were someone from the UAE in difficulty  charged with an offence under Australian law, there'd be a mirror  image of the - some of the complexities involved here. 

 QUESTION: Minister, your Senate colleague Trish Crossin was in the  news today saying she hadn't been offered any post from the Prime  Minister when she was moved aside from her Senate role. Do you  think that Senator Crossin should've been offered something… 

 BOB CARR: I can't add anything to that, thanks. Thank you.
