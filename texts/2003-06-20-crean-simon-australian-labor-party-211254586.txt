 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION    

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - Perth - 20 June 2003   

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects: Bali Inquiry; Children in detention   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, the Prime Minister said he had no forewarning  about the Bali attacks, do you believe that is not the case?    

 CREAN: I think there are a lot of questions that still have to be  answered and his Foreign Minister, according to the Office of National  Assessments, was told that Bali was an attractive target four months before  the bombing happened. Why didn’t the government act on it? They are the  questions that have to be answered. It is all very well for the Prime Minister  to say that he didn’t know but his Foreign Minister did. The government has  to accept collectives responsibly. The government has to answer, why, if it  was given that information it didn’t see the need to act.   

 JOURNALIST: How has the security of ASIO and Intelligence failed?    

 CREAN: I do not think we can make pre-emptive judgements about  that, I think that what was interesting last night was that the head of ASIO  accepted that ASIO had failed because 88 Australians had been killed. If that  is accepted we have a responsibility to ensure that intelligence gathering is  improved in this country. That is what the Parliamentary inquiry is about. I  cannot see any reason why the Prime Minister should hide from that, he  should accept that we have had a tragedy, we have got to learn from it. We  have to help the victims but we have got to learn from it. That is the purpose  of the inquiry.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you think that the inquiry into intelligence agencies in  this country can learn from this experience? Can you elaborate………….?   

 CREAN: There now is a decision of the Parliament to establish that  sort of inquiry. The Prime Minister didn’t want to have that, I think that begs  the question as to what the Government has to hide. But let’s wait and see,  let’s have the enquiry and come out with it. But it was very interesting that I  was scheduled to have a meeting with the Office of National Assessments

 yesterday afternoon and the Government cancelled that meeting on me. Now  I think that does beg the question, what has the Government have to hide?  Why shouldn’t we have open inquiry into our intelligence gathering capacity  to learn the lessons and make recommendations for the future. But also  significantly, why has the Government denied me what I am entitled to and  that is the sharing of this information so that the Opposition can make  assessments with the Government as to whether we should proceed.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you agree with Andrew Wilkie that the Government  relied on so called ‘junk intelligence’ to justify going to war with Iraq?    

 CREAN: I think it is very interesting that Mr Wilkie had to go to  London to give that evidence. Why, because there is no inquiry here in  Australia that allows that evidence to be given. I think Mr Wilkie’s evidence  does need to be tested, but it needs to be tested through an inquiry and that  is why we need one.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you think the Government has lied to the Australian  public?   

 CREAN: I think that the Government needs to come clean with all  of the information that was at its disposal and I think we have got to learn  the lessons from these tragedies and make sure they do not happen again. 

 That is the reason for the inquiry.    

 JOURNALIST: What do you think the Government may be hiding?   

 CREAN:  I think that there is an entitlement for the public to know  and that is the purpose of the enquiry and that is all we are seeking. I don’t  know why the Government is trying to run away from it, I don’t know why the  Government would cancel a meeting scheduled for me with the Office of the  National Assessments at the last minute yesterday. It poses a whole lot of  questions and I am interested in the answers and that is what the inquiry will  do.    

 JOURNALIST:  (inaudible)    

 CREAN: We can go through the legalities and I have not had the  chance to read the full court decision, but the simple facts remain, kids should  not be behind razor wire. You don’t need a court decision to tell you that. And  I have been calling for kids to be brought out from behind the razor wire,  they are the victims, they are the ones that tell me, whatever you say about  their parents and the reasons they come here, it is the kids that have no say  and they shouldn’t be denied opportunity. It is not appropriate for them to be  behind the razor wire and I don’t think you need a court decision to tell you  that.
