 MEDIA RELEASE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER

 FA45 3 April 2002

 MEETING WITH AFGHANISTAN MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS

 I had the pleasure today of meeting in Melbourne with the Minister for Public Works in the interim Afghanistan administration, Dr Abdul Khaliq Fazal.

 Dr Fazal is one of two ministers in the interim administration who have strong Australian connections.

 Our meeting was a valuable opportunity to discuss the current situation in Afghanistan and the plans and priorities of the Afghan administration for rebuilding the country after many years of conflict and upheaval.

 Australia has pledged $40.3 million to help with emergency relief and reconstruction efforts. Our assistance to date has been regarded as timely and well-directed. Dr Fazal thanked Australia for its civil and military assistance to Afghanistan through our aid program and support for the international coalition against terrorism.

 Dr Fazal reported that the security situation was improving, especially in Kabul but also in most provincial areas. The International Security Authority Force (ISAF) were making an important contribution to enabling the restoration of peace and stability and had gained widespread acceptance among the Afghan people.

 Encouragingly, Dr Fazal spoke about the reopening of schools and universities, with girls as well as boys resuming their education.

 We discussed the understandings reached in recent ministerial discussions on the matter of Afghan people seeking refugee status and the willingness of the Afghan authorities to accept returnees.

 Dr Fazal extended an invitation for me to visit Afghanistan which I hope to be able take up at some time in the future.
