 16 July 2012 

 Doorstop interview  Joint interview with  The Hon Kate Ellis MP  Member for Adelaide 

 SUBJECTS: Funding to ensure residents are equipped to take advantage of the National  Broadband Network, the Greens, Sri Lanka and asylum seekers, Tea Party tactics taking hold  in Liberal Party, ASIC regulations  

 ELLIS: 

 Good morning all and welcome to beautiful Prospect. Can I take this opportunity first of all  to welcome our Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan. It's always a pleasure to have you in  Adelaide, particularly talking about such an important program.  

 I'm also joined here today by two of our local mayors. Of course our Lord Mayor in Adelaide  Stephen Yarwood and our local Mayor here in Prospect, David O'Loughlin. Both who have  been so hugely committed in making sure our local community get everything on offer out of  the National Broadband Network. I'm pleased that we have different levels of government  working together.  

 What we see here today is that we are announcing $1.25 million to equip the residents of  Adelaide and Prospect to get everything that is possible out of the National Broadband  Network. We are seeing in this area at the moment there is already work under way to roll out  the National Broadband Network. We are seeing already the work is underway on the  infrastructure.  

 But of course we know that the possibilities that accompany that infrastructure are almost  endless. We know that with the NBN brings a world of new possibilities for residents and for  local businesses alike. The funding that we've announced today is to ensure that we can  empower both local residents and local businesses and teach them how they can get the most  potential out of the National Broadband Network.  

 This is something that is incredibly exciting for local families, for local residents but also for  our local economy. We are seeing already with the rolling out of the NBN in Prospect, we are  seeing new businesses roll in. What we are now doing is setting up hubs so that we can work  with those businesses so they can expand and take all of the opportunities with this amazing  new infrastructure.  

 I'd like to congratulate our local mayors. I know both of them are so incredibly passionate  about ensuring that we equip Adelaide for the future and that's what this announcement here  today is about. I'd like to turn to the local Mayor to say a bit about what the funding here  today means for the local community before we turn to the Deputy Prime Minister. 

 O'LOUGHLIN:  

 Thanks Kate and thanks Wayne for the presentation today we're really excited about it.  Prospect's delighted to be the first metropolitan roll-out site after Willunga. We're in the  centre of the north of the city of Adelaide. The hub is an integral part of our local library and  our local art gallery.  

 We're going to have a heap of people come through here for those two purposes, but also to  understand what the NBN can mean to them. We'll have a real kitchen mocked up, we'll have  a real lounge, we'll have a real study, we'll have a training facility and a real boardroom for  people to come in and touch and play and understand what the NBN can do. And understand  what that capacity can do for them and their households and businesses and their future.  

 Kids are getting really excited about the creative content that they'll be able to manufacture  here in the hub and upload and give themselves a name and a world-stage. So we've got all  sorts of dimensions and it's right here in the Prospect library which is right on Main- North  Rd, Highway 1. Very prominent location. We're very excited. Thank you. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 One would assume that lots of businesses would already have the internet. Is that a wrong  assumption? 

 O'LOUGHLIN: 

 Lots of businesses have the internet. The NBN is 100 megabits a second is like comparing the  existing internet to be a bathtub in the ocean and the new internet to be an oil tanker. It's  30,000 times the capacity. I'm comfortable in saying we don't even know what we're going to  achieve with the NBN compared to the current broadband services over copper.  

 There's no comparison other than it's the same internet service. It's massively expanded. So  businesses are very excited. Not just about how they can run more efficiently, but how much  more they can do over the next few years. 

 ELLIS:  

 So this funding will go towards two hubs. One right here but the other one in the City. I'll  turn to the Lord Mayor to talk about their hub in Grote Street and what that would mean. 

 YARWOOD: 

 I'd like to thank you Deputy Prime Minister for attending today and also Minister Kate Ellis  and Mayor O'Loughlin. Adelaide City Council's particularly pleased to be a part of the future  of the NBN and to be working with the Federal Government to roll out this vital piece of  infrastructure.  

 We will be transforming our Grote Street Library School room upstairs into a digital hub for  training to provide services not only for the community, in particular those people who are  not yet up-skilled in technologies and get them to understand the future of the NBN and the  use and opportunities that the internet will create for them.  

 But also working with small businesses in the city, one-on-one to train them in the potentials  that the NBN and the future technologies that will be associated, will be able to provide. So  we're very pleased to be able to be a part of this project, co-fund with the Federal  Government, to provide education facilities in the City of Adelaide for the community, for  small businesses, for the future of Adelaide, South Australia and the nation.  

 TREASURER: 

 It's also good to be here to announce these grants for these technology hubs, so that super-fast  affordable broadband is available to all our communities, but also particularly to our business  community.  

 It's very important in the 21st century that countries such as Australia have access to super-fast affordable broadband. In the 21st century to be successful not just in the economy but  also in society, our economies and societies need to be driven by clean energy, but also by  super-fast affordable broadband.  

 If you look to our north, our major trading partners are substantially investing in the super-fast broadband. For Australia we have to make sure that we put in place this network of  affordable fast broadband to ensure we don't get left behind.  

 As the Mayors were saying before, we've got a horse and buggy form of communication at  the moment in the form of copper wire. What we're putting in here is 21st century technology  to empower our business and to empower our local communities with the most superior  technology available, and which will last for forty or fifty years and drive very efficient  practices when it comes to our businesses, particularly small businesses, but also empower  individuals and give them access to a whole range of services that they've not previously had.  

 This will enhance dramatically what we're capable of doing through our education system. It  will enhance dramatically what we're capable of doing in our health system. In a state like  South Australia it will mean regional areas will be connected and have new health services  available through super-fast broadband. But even in urban communities what this means for  businesses is they have access to a technology which will dramatically lift their productivity  and not just join our suburbs together, not just join our cities together in South Australia, but  connect them to the rest of our country.  

 But most importantly, to connect Australia directly to the world and through that we will  generate new business, through that we will generate innovation and through that we will  generate economic growth. But also what you see here in terms of our libraries is we will  empower individuals to have access to knowledge they've not previously had and to get it in  an affordable way.  

 That's why hubs like this are so important because they will play the role of explaining to  local communities how they can connect to the National Broadband Network, how they can  use this technology to enrich their lives. So we empower business and we empower 

 individuals, we make our economy more prosperous and we make it more inclusive for all of  our people.  

 So that's why the Government has been so committed to this vital piece of nation-building  infrastructure - every bit as important as the Snowy Mountain Scheme was to Australia after  the war. Every bit as important as the early rail roads were to Australia. This is vital, it's vital  to our future and that's why the Government has put it in place and is rolling it out across our  country as fast as we possibly can.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 Treasurer, just refresh my memory and this is based a little on ignorance I confess. But the  NBN for homes, is fibre to the node or fibre to the home?  

 TREASURER: 

 Fibre to the home. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 So all the difficulties with Telstra, they've all been overcome?  

 TREASURER: 

 Yes, all of the difficulties with Telstra have been worked through. We have a definitive  agreement with Telstra. What we have now is a wholesale NBN network which will also  drive competition in the future in terms of prices because there will be a wide variety of  providers available. And a wide variety of services available over the network 

 JOURNALIST: 

 What is the rate of take up in Brisbane, particularly small businesses?  

 TREASURER: 

 At the moment in our roll-out areas the rate of take up I think is more than the market scoping  that we did and it varies from area to area. When I move around the community the one  group that is if you like most excited about broadband is small business.  

 What it will be here, you can talk to our local Mayors about what they're expecting. But I  know that generally business, even when it's relatively close to the city, is generally pretty  unhappy with the broadband speeds that they have over the old copper network. In my  electorate for example, in Brisbane, only 10-15 kilometres from the city, there are parts of  those areas which have very poor broadband access at the moment and of course it gets worse  the further you go out.  

 So we would expect a very high take up among business, but there will be many people who  will be looking forward to conducting their business affairs from home once they have access  to super-fast broadband, fast-affordable broadband. What a hub like this can do is show the 

 possibilities for both the business community and also for individuals about what they can  achieve.  

 There's always a reluctance when you've been doing something the same way, to change. In  terms of the facility here, people will be able to walk into the library walk down there and  they'll see an internet connection which will be provided by the NBN. They'll be able to see  actually what will go to their house and how it relates to what they might do in their own  premises. This is the sort of educational activity that we need to, if you like, further show to  people the possibilities of fast, affordable broadband.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 So when do we see for instance, it's fine in the City of Adelaide and Prospect, but the whole  of South Australia and regional areas. When do you see completion? 

 TREASURER: 

 We've got all those timetables available. I'm happy to make them available to you. There's  stage one, stage two, stage three of the roll-out right across the country. We can't give it to  everybody at once, this is a big nation-building project. Stage one is already going on here  and I can get the Mayors to talk about what it means and how many houses are going to be  covered in their areas. This is the early roll-out we're dealing with here. But those plans are  published and were published a few months ago by the NBN. But of course before you roll it  out you've got to have the hubs like this to show people in a practical way what can be  achieved. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 Are you expecting that businesses will be creative (inaudible)? 

 TREASURER: 

 Too right we do. That is the experience overseas. What the NBN becomes at the business  level is a tool with which they innovate. It's just not the established thing they do over the  internet as we were talking here before. People will invent new products through access to  super-fast, affordable broadband.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 Anthony Chisholm has come out and talked about the Greens alliance in Queensland and how  it could affect Labor's chances in attracting the blue-collar vote. Do you support those  assessments?  

 TREASURER: 

 They're matters that are dealt with by the State Secretaries. They are not dealt with by the  Parliamentary wing. They'll continue to do that. 

 JOURNALIST:  

 (inaudible) 

 TREASURER: 

 My main focus at the moment is on economic policy - making sure we're creating jobs,  making sure we keep in place and further put in place a fair system of industrial relations and  particularly to spread the benefits of the mining boom right around all of our communities.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 What are the implications if you lose the by-election in Melbourne on the weekend?  

 TREASURER: 

 Well, it's a state by-election. There's none.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 Just on another point. Sri Lanka seems to be successfully turning back boats, yet we don't  seem able to do that. What's their secret?  

 TREASURER: 

 Well the Government takes the advice of the naval authorities. The advice of naval  authorities is turning back boats endangers lives and particularly our naval personnel - the  very strong advice that the Government has from the naval authorities.  

 What the authorities there do is entirely a matter for them. But here what we need is the  enduring arrangement which breaks the people smuggling modelling and what it does in  particular in breaking the model is that it saves lives.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 So the Sri Lankan Government or any officials speaking on their behalf who say it does  work, they've got it wrong. They don't know what they're talking about?  

 TREASURER: 

 No what I'm saying is you've got an entirely different set of conditions in that country. The  authorities there take their decisions in a way which they normally do. Our strong advice  from our naval authorities is that they will not endanger lives of naval personnel.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 Just on the Greens. Are you at all concerned (inaudible)?  

 TREASURER: 

 No I'm not concerned about these matters. What I'm concerned with is the prosperity of the  country and making sure that we maximise the benefits of the mining boom and spread the  opportunities right around our community, to every corner of it.  

 Of course here today, fast affordable broadband is one way to do that. So that's my concern,  but there's nothing new in the fact that the Australian Labor Party has parties to its left if you  like, like the Greens and parties to its right like the Liberal Party. There's a political contest  which takes place. The Labor Party's values are the values of working people in Australia.  And we express those values in policies like a fair industrial relations system, in nation-building policies like fast affordable broadband and our commitment to clean energy  technology.  

 We have a political contest with all of those parties. The Liberal Party at the moment has  gone to the extreme right - the loopy right if you like, has been taken over by Tea-Party type  activists and is following the sorts of policies we are seeing from that group in the United  States.  

 So I'm pretty concerned about that tilt to the right in the Liberal Party and the way in which it  is expressed in this country by opposition to policies like the NBN.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 (inaudible)?  

 TREASURER: 

 We are in a contest with parties, minor parties and major parties. We're in a contest with the  Liberal Party, we're in a contest with Bob Katter's party and we're in a contest with the  Greens. It's always been the case  

 JOURNALIST: 

 Do you think we need to legislate on creeping changes?  

 TREASURER: 

 The Government is awaiting advice from ASIC. We're taking advice from Treasury. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 Do you think it's possible though?  

 TREASURER: 

 I haven't taken any decisions. The Government hasn't taken any decisions
