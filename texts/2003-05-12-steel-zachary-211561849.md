  THE POLITICS OF EXCLUSION AND DENIAL 

  THE MENTAL HEALTH COSTS OF AUSTRALI.A'S REFUGEE

  ' h e  mass resettlement o f  rekgee pop'ulations, tnany of whom have Been victims of war and 

  organised viol,ei~ce, has led to an intematioiial. fows on the m,ental health needs ofthis 

  population with the establishment of specialist refugee torme and trauma services throughout 

  the world md a burgeoning of epidmiological research mongst conflict-affected and 

  displaced populations. At the same time, the increasing flow of refugees fivm conflict hat 

  spats Ras created a. feeling of cri.si.s amongst inany ind.ustriniised countries with over nine 

  million asylum seekers requesting rehgoe protection in Western Europe, North America, 

  Jiqxin and Australia over the period 1985 to 2002. 

  Australia, one of the few countries with 

  at the forefront in the developinent and iinpleineiitation of poiicies to deter asytum seekers. 

  Key components of th,is policy include the mandatory detention o f  tmautliorized arrivals; the 

  issuing of 3 year tcinpoi-ai-y protection. visa,s, and most recently the traiisfer of asylum seekers 

  intercepted en route to Australia to a third state for processing and or removal. The policies 

  developed by the Federal Govcmment have 'been associated with cz signi:ficant reduction in the 

  orghsed rehfilgee resettlement program, has been 

  number of asylum scelm-s traveling io Australia. There have been no new boat arnvals since 

  the ~nipI~men~atjo~i of Operatioil Relex that involved a naval blockade oPNorthem Australia 

  The inunber of asylum seclcers arriving by air has alfio declined with only 6,103 new 

  applications lodged during 2002 representing a 52% reduction on the 12,366 applications 

  lodged in 2001. 

  The trend in Ausiralisl appears to reflect an international move towards a greater reliance on 

  deterrence in the ~ ~ n a g e ~ ~ ~ ~  and processing of asylum seekers. The US Department of 

  Homeland S e c W y  has recently introduced Operation Libeny Sbield, requiring the automatic 

  and contiillled detention of all asylum seekers miviiig from counlSies where tenons1 

  ~rga~iiza~jons Iuve been active'. A recent proposaf. by the United , ~ ~ d o ~ ' s  Home 

  Scctetary, Mr David Blunketl, lo establish protection zones around the European Union, if 

  2 

  implemented, could see the establishment of transit processing centres for- asylum seekers that 

  are likely to be based an the Aushalian Pacific SoIution mod,e12. 

  It is essential that, in attempting to manage tlie perceived international asylum crisis, Western 

  cou,ntries do not i ~ ~ v ~ ~ e ~ t l y  implemen% poficies thau cause Siirther harm to this ~ ~ ~ e r ~ b l ~  

  population. Since the htroduction of mand.atory d.etentioii in 1992 many asylum seekers and 

  their children have been. held in detention for considerable periods of h e .  By 1.998 over 80 

  deQiiiees had been held in detention for between two and five years3, and as of April, 2002, 

  256 asylum seekers had been held for in excess of 18 months4. Repwted rqorts have 

  appeared in the media ofriors, clamage 10 property, Imnger stri.kes, acts of self-lmm and 

  attempted su,ici.de in tlie centres. Over m eight month period in 2001,, ‘there were 264 

  documented inciclents of self-harm amongst deta8inees6, 

  Concerns about the impact of prolonged d.etention on the psychosocial status of 

  asylum seekers have becn r ~ s e d  by bodies such as the United Nations Wigli Co~~issioner 

  for Rehgees’, the United Nations Commissioner on l h m m  R i g l d ,  the Australian Human 

  Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (I-IREOC)’, the Au.stTalian Commonwealth 

  Ombudsman7, human rights orgmiza.titions such as Ainnesty Intermtion alBiY and Human 

  Kights Watch”, aid medical practitioners 

  impact of the use of Temporary Protection Visas have been expressed by P number of 

  bodi.es’O’lg with increasing anecdotal evidence suggesting that individu.als on TPVs are kept in 

  a state ofcliroiiic anticipatory stress. 

  . Similarly, concerns about the I ~,Iz,I~,~~,~s,~~,~~?,Ls 

  In this evolving geopalilical environment, it is imperative to establish a scientific 

  evidence base to evaluate the imp& of long-term d,etention and the use of temporary 

  protection. visas, on ‘the general ancl mental 1ieal.tli of asylum seekers and. their families. I 

  would like to present .findings from two studies that are directly ,relevant to each of these 

  tasks.

  ~ A ~ ~ ~ T O ~ Y  ~ETENTIO~ 

  A major impediment :Facing those attempting ,to document the impact of detention on 

  asylum seekers is the xela.ctaacc of AustTalian government ofkials, and those responsible for 

  the management of detention fadities, to allow access to the detention centres by 

  i n ~ ~ p e ~ d e n ~  health researcl~ms~~. Respite this a small itumber of studies have investigated the 

  mental health of detained populations in A~istra1,ia. Professor Patrick McGorry and 

  colIeagues” reported SL sumy of25 detslined Tamil asylum seekors held at cui, urban detention 

  centre during 1997 and 1998. Compared to compatriot asylum seeekcrs in the community, 

  detainees ~ ~ h ~ b i t ~ d  high Ievels of depression, p o s t ~ a ~ ~ a ~ c  sfress, anxiety, panic and physical 

  symptoms. Dr Aanzer Sultan and Kevin 0’Su.lli~an~~ found that 32 of33 detainees at an 

  i.mmigration detention centre in Sydiwy displayed symptoms o f  major depressive illness with 

  most sh.owing deterioration ,in their mental state a6 the length of detention increased. 

  There is a dearth of dnra about the mental health of detained asylum seeker children 

  alrd heir fmily mits licld in detention centres. Between July, 2001 and April, 2002, 1871 

  minors were held in, detenlion in Austr:rali,a. As ofNovember 2002, 139 minors remained in 

  detention in mainland Australia with an nd.d,itj:jcmal 169 children held in offshore detention 

  facilities. Observations imde by Sultan and O’SuIlivan suggest that psych.ologka1 

  d.isturbance amongst children in detenti.on is c ~ r n ~ ~ ~  but they were unable to investigate &e 

  extent ofthe problem systematically. On the basis of clinical impressions, Dr !Sarah Mares 

  and ~oll.eagues~~ concluded that children. in detention are at high risk of emotional trauma 

  since parents are unable to provide for them adequately or YO shield them from acts of 

  violence in a degrading, hostile and liopeless enuironnient. 

  A press release by a comprelimsive alliance of doctors and. other health professionals 

  representing Colleges and Guild organisadom acrosa Au.sl;mlia, 8 May 2002, stated that ”The 

  evid,eiice we have compil.ed strongly suggests th,at the living conditions for asylum seekers 

  4 

  and their children in detention centres are not appropriate, md are leading to s i ~ i i f i c ~ r  

  physical and mental health problems."20 111 order to provide empirical weight to tliese 

  advocacy statements, it is essential to gather systematic data on the status of children in 

  detention. centres.

  The aim of this first study was to docimeiit the psychiatric status of a near complete 

  sample of children and. their fmi.li.cs from one ethnic gsoup held for an extcnded period of 

  time in a rcmotc immigration detention facility in Ausbdia. 

  Ten out o f a  total of eleven eligible :fmili,es from the s m e  etlznic background held in 

  a remote detention centre were assessed. The ~ ~ ~ i ~ i e s  ~ o ~ p ~ s e c l ,  14 adults nnd 22 cb,i~dre~. 

  Family size ranged :firom two TO si.x persons. Children inchd,ed 13 boys and nine girls with 

  ages ran,ging'fiorn 3 - 19 years. Di.ffcu1ries gain.ing access to deQai.nees in person for research 

  purposes led. us to undertake the assessments over the phone. Ethics approval for this 

  ~ ~ ~ o d a i o g ~  was obtilined~ from the University of New South Wales. The assessments were 

  undertaken betwcen 5"' September 2002 md 23'" February 2003, by three same language- 

  speaki.ng psychologists wi,tli prior professional experience working with refugees from this 

  ethnic bslckgsuncl. Th.e presence of psychiatric il.lness mongst adults and. children was 

  assessed through the ad.ministration of structured diagnmtic inslnunents, namely 'the SClD for 

  Ad,ults and K-SADS-PL, ,for cllildren The positive i d ~ t i ~ c a t ~ o n  aftlie symptoms was based 

  on C O ~ S C R G U S  agreemcnt amongst the three messing clinicians. Both instruments were 

  ddministered to assess cumelit disorders and disoders prior to arrival in Australia. 

  5 

  In addition, we assessed exposure to trauma prior lo arriving in Australia and within 

  the detention environment, The interviews also iiicluded SL series of questions about parenting 

  competency and faniily intimacy. 

  Findings 

  The average period oP detention for the 10 families was 2 yeas and 4 months (range: 2 years 

  to 2 years, 8 months). All adults reported traumatic experiences in their coimLry of origin. 

  A11 families reported fleeing their country of origin out of fear %or the lire of one or all of the 

  family members. Most had leA llieir country of origin ~llegal~y, all had travelled via 

  Southeast Asia and then by boat lo Australia fkom hclonesia. Most o l  the families reporled 

  traumatic journeys. All families had ai-rived in Australia without aulhorised entry documents 

  and had lodged applications for refugee protection with the Department of Immigration. hi 

  all insuinces, applications had bemi refused at bath the primary and review stages. 

  Trauma exposwe ifi CbebeBtion 

  All families described tmrrnai'ic experiences in detentioa, such as witnessing riots, detainees 

  fighting each other, fisc breakouts, detainees self-harming, and wilnesshg suicide attempts. It 

  should be noted that the resewcbers coitld not verify independently allegations made by 

  asyl.iim seekers particularly those directed at detention oficers.

  There were marked differences between adults and children in the distress associated With 

  vsm'ous incidents. The children parti,cularly reported being distressed by witnessing the 

  frequent acts of sclf-ham and su.icide by otlier dersin.ee6. At times, children witnessed their 

  6 

  parents suicide a ~ ~ r n p t ~ ,  or sm+ their parents hit with batons by officers. A number also 

  witnessed their fiic1id.s and siblings hann.ing t11,einselves. Other problems report& as 

  particularly distressin.g by iiH children in.cluded. boredom, isolation and poor quaIity food i.n 

  ~ ~ t e ~ ~ i o ~ ~ -  

  Tile experiences rated as serious probleim by adulrs related pri.mariiy to the 

  immigration process and matmen1 by cletention oficers. 

  Physical assault by officers 'was rated 11s a sa-ious prohkm by most adults (12,86%) 

  with a number of children also alleging physical. assault (7,37%) by detention ceiitre officers. 

  A nu,mbex of families reported enforced periods of scpzuzltion li-om each other during 

  detention (7 families), ofim when a parent was talcen to solitary ~ o n ~ ~ , e ~ ~ n t  either as 

  punishment or in response to self-limn attempts. T h . ~ e  were a number o f  incidents where

  Psychiatric disorders 

  There was a marked increase in psychiatric morbidity from Uie period prior IO detention to the 

  assessment date. 

  Adults 

  increase in psychopathology subsequent to detention. The increase in suicidal ideation was 

  7 

  substantial: none o,f the adults had experienced persistent sw.ioida1 ideation prior to detention. 

  At the rime of assessment, almost all adults (13, 93%) tliougld pe,rsislently ofkiJJing 

  tb.emselves. A third of h e  a.du1.t~ had self-lmmed. or alternptad suicide. The remainder who 

  expressed suicidal ideation but; had not self-limed all stated that it was concern for their 

  ch.i.ld.ren 'that preven.ted them fTom acting on tbei.r thoughts. Two ( I  4%) of 1:h.e adults had 

  evidence ofpsyc1toti.c sympt0m.s and met criteria for a severe major depressive disorder with 

  psychotic features and both liad inn& previous suicide attempts.

  dom.estic viol.ence liad multiple previous d.i sord,ers, Xn contrast, d the 'time of assessment, 

  afer having spent in excess oftwo years in deten.ti.on, sill children were diagnosed with at 

  ].east one psychiatric disorder and most (1 6, 80%) were d.iagnosed wi.th multiple disorders, 

  representing a 1 0-fold in.craase in 1:ke totel number of diagnoses identified. Two childtsii 

  were diagnosed with all. five of'the p~ycliiatric disorclers assessed. All, but one child received 

  a diagnosis of major depressive di.sor.der: and half were diagnosed. with PTSD. The symptoms 

  of posltraumatic stress d.isorder expen.encec1 by the chil.drcn were almost exclusively related to 

  experience of trauma in detention. Childrm described nightmares about being hit by officers, 

  and many of th.e children (I 3, G5%) were cl.escribed by their piinnary caregver a,s having 

  episodes where hey would scream in tlaeir sleep, or wake up shou.ting. 

  Half of the children inanifested sepration mxicly disorder, whilst lhe majority of 

  other clii.ldren experienced persistent synptoiiis of sepaatioii anxiety bux at a level that d.id

  Over half of the children in the target age group for eiiuresis (5 to 12 years of age) 

  suâ¬fered fiom the disorder, regularly wetting tltemselves three or more times 8 week. Almost 

  half the children assessed had developed behaviour consisleiit with a diagnosis of oppositional 

  dcfiant disorcln-. More than half oCtile children regularly expressed suicidal ideation, many 

  thought it would be better 1 F they were dead and made statements such as “there is no point in 

  life, one must dic, 1 wish I was not in this world”. A quartet (5) had sel F-harmed either by 

  slashing their wrists (3) or banging their heads aga6.nst walls (2). 

  Deteatiort retated traumatic s y ~ p t o ~ ~  

  All the adults and llze majority of children reported that they were bolhetecl a lot or exlrernely 

  by sudden and upsetting memories about detention, intrusive images of events that had 

  occuned in detention, feelings of saclcluess and hopelessness about detailion and episodes o f  

  anger in the week prior to interview. 

  E’ect of detention on parenting 

  The majonly oFparsnts (13 of 24) felt they were no longer able lo care for, support, or control 

  tlne behaviour o F their children, whereas a13 parents had felt able to do this prior lo being 

  detained. 

  DISCUSSION 

  In c1rawin.g inferences fiom the study, it is important to note tlie strengrhs md 1.Imitations of 

  the methodology. Unlike any other invessigation, into asylum d.etention., the study was able to 

  remit a near complete pOpLkhti5R of detained fmifies (10 of 11 families) from one language 

  group in a single remote detcntion ,facili,ty, Psychiatric casencss was d.eterminec1 u.sin.g 

  vali.da1ed. psychia~~ic d.iagnosric j.nstrumeiits with ratings made by t h e e  same language- 

  specding psycbalogists, all with previous experience in assesshg refu.gec populations o f  this 

  9 

  language ~ a c ~ ~ ~ u ~ ~ , c l .  Diczgn.osis was based on consensus agreemeill: reducing the possibility 

  'that the findings reflect the outcomes of oiie aberrant interviewer. Although based on 

  telephone interviews, the ineascires did not depen.d on direct mental state obswarions. 

  Psychiatric dismrbmce prior to detention in Awtralia was based on retrospecthe 

  reports, an approach thzt could have i,ntroduced inaccuracies in recall. Nevertheless, the rates 

  ofpremigmrion mental illness reporled. by the adults were simi1,a to rates identified in orher 

  post-con:flict popu1ation.s 24,25,21 

  The possibility that r:espondcnts may have exaggrsrated their reports of experiences 

  and symptoms hi detention must be acknowledged.. A number of observiltioiis suggest that 

  such bias inay not have exemd. a major influence iii the reports obtained. Each fanjly unit 

  was interviewed sepal-arely aid yet there was notable consi.stency across families in repom of 

  pubhcly witnessed incidents rhat had occurred in detention., Several. families were held in 

  different comp0und.s within h e  detention :facility m.aking the lilcelihood of collusi.oii 

  implausible. Sim,ilarly, intei%ews with parents and children were generally Ganied out at 

  separate times, yet weports of symptoms experienced. by children, particularly when they 

  concerned overt belia.viousa1 manifestations, were highly consistent between parental and 

  chiId in,fonmnts. Sim,ilmly, many children provided. collaborative reports o:l the symptoms 

  experienced by their parents and siblings. The clinical descnpti0n.s provided and the 

  disorders identified are remarlcably consistent with other less systematic reports about the 

  problem faced by :Families in these setrings22s23. 

  Conclusions 

  The rates of maitd illness dacuinented amongst the IO fmilies sumeyed in the 

  present study are at a level that should raise great concern for health professionals, even given 

  the limited sample size. The data obtained should provide a warning to policy makers about 

  10 

  the potential damaging effects of prolonged mandatary detention on the mental status of 

  asylum seekers. 

  TEMPORARY PROTECTION VISAS 

  In October 1999 the Federal Oovenunent i~i~rQdLice~ ~eg~s~a~~on requiring the issuing of three 

  year temporary protection visas for asylum seekers found to be refagees, but who had arrived 

  in huslrdlia witlmrt proper documentation. The new visas also introduced. 8 ntunber o f  

  restrictions on the enfirlemenrs avail&le to refugees an TPVs, such as no access to 

  commonwealth fmd.ed English. Impage tr~ning, kou.sing support or employment assistance, 

  with access to professional or vocational trainhg charged at overseas student mates. 

  Tempomy protccti,on. vi.sa h.old.ers c'mnot leave and. re-enter Amtralia and they are not 

  entitled to fmily reunion. At the tenninatioii of the three year period, TPV holders are 

  required to undergo a fhll. merits review of their cliuin. for protection aid if a protection 

  obligation is forind to continue to exist the ~e~sl~~ion, exaabled t h e  refugee to apply for a 

  permanent protection vtsa. However this latter benefit was removed in September 2001, 

  when the Federal. Par1iamen"l; passed t h e  Border Protection Legislation rhar made such. 

  Temporary Protection Visas permanently tempormy. 

  As of May 2002, some 8,409 Temporary Protection, Visas had been issued to a.sylum 

  seekers who had established claims for refugee protection, primarily of Afghan, Iraqi and Iranian 

  backgrounds. Since the inception o:Cthe tempormy protection legislation, significant concern has 

  been expressed at the impa,cc on refbgees by human lights organisations and by torhire and trauma 

  services working d.irectly with refugees on TPVs. Pew1 Peniandcs, team leader ofthe Early 

  Intervention Project at STA,RRIFS summed up the observations of lier servicc as fO?lows: 

  "Most TPV holders present as anxious and. agitated, lull of unexpressed anger against the perccived 

  injuslice related to their clelenljon experfences fwd temporary visa status and against those remaining 

  inclifferenl or perceived as LinheIpIu1. They report insom,nia and agitation and aIso tension headaches, 

  gastro-intestinsI disturbanccs and bodily aches and pains. Through denial, clissociation and thought 

  suppression they h a w  Iearnt to alter on unbearable reality. The majority are bitter and feel forsaken 

  by Loth 'man and God'. The psychological losses combine, resultinj~ in a chronic state of depression. 

  Believing they are being held caplives at &e mercy and control of the Government of Australia, many 

  describe themselves a6 being reduced to a s ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ a n i r n ~  lifeform.. ... As a result of prolonpd, 

  repeated traama, many TPV hoIctctrs experieiice an inteilsie numbing fedhtg of pain which they find 

  difficalt to articulate and express. Many describe this as " B i m i n g  in the Fin?, but sbiiill confinaring tu 

  Live". 

  The Meiital Health Status of Temporary Protection Visa holders and Permanent 

  Residents from a single ethic group in Australia: Preliminary findings 

  Zachary Steel, Derrick Silove, Shake11 Mamartin, Marianna Szabo, Renate Wagner 

  The aim @[this second study was to examine the mental health status of refugees placed Q T ~  TBVs 

  in comparison to refitgees and niigraiits with permanent residency. The study is currently in 

  pmgress with data fiom the firs1 117 assessments presented. As the find.ings have not been 

  discussed with key community leaders, the country and ethnic background of the refugee and 

  migrant group will not be d,isclosed. The sample consists o f  76 TPV holders and 37 permanent 

  rcsidents, 21 of whom were refugees and. 16 were migrants, Sampling was undem.ken using 

  community Iists obtained 6om key religious a.n.d corninunity leaders. Tlie sfxdy employed a self 

  repon quesriannaire format adminiswed by a bilingual worker from the samc ethnic background 

  as the respondents. 

  The questionnai~e included a number ofwidely empIoyed meastires of mental kealTh and 

  disability mongst reffrgee ~omm#nities. The presentation of findings will focus spccifically on 

  12 

  [he results obrained. :from administrntion. oE the Harvarcl Trauma Qwstionnaire (I-ITQ>27. The 

  E-lward Trauma Questionnaire docurnenls 16 coninion Irauma events experienced by war- 

  affected corn.mun.ities and assesses symptoms associated wiBi posttraumatic stress disorder. 

  The syn,prom scale has been calibrated in a number of di:Ffere:en,t ethnic and language g r o ~ p s  to 

  derive a probable d,iagnosis oEPTSD throu.gh the application of a th~-eshold cut-off score. 

  The questionnaire also inc1ud.d. a nine item scak assessiag the extent to which the 

  respondents had been troubled by intrusive thoughts, n i ~ ~ ~ a ~ ~  arid associated avoidance 

  and hopelessness about the occurrence of future traumatic events. This questionnaire was 

  developed in respoase to the obscivatj.on than: when discussing syroptoms o:f PTSD both 

  asylum seekers an.d TPVs ofieii reported that they were not troubled by i,ntnisive memories of 

  pcls't traumatic incidents, but by te;nrif~ng images of imagined future tTaurnatic events to 

  themsel.ves or Wi,r family. Finally, the Pem-State WOY Qu.estiomaire, a. 16 item measwe 

  designed to assess the construct: of pathdogical worry was also included. 

  Findings 

  categories assessed by ilie HTQ with 71% (54) reporting being close to death, 50% reporting 

  the inwder of f m i l y  or fiicncls, 23% reporting imprisoivnent and 20% torture. Permanent 

  residents rcpofled exposure to ail average of Cow trauma categories which was significantly 

  lower than TPVs, with 39% (1 4) reporting t l x  murder of a family meinba- or fiend, 27% (1 0) 

  reporling being close to death, 24% (9) reporting ~ ~ ~ 6 0 ~ e i ~ t  and 19% (7) reporting torture. 

  There was no rlilfcrence in the level ortrauma reported by the permanent resrdents who were 

  13 

  refu.gees or migrants suggesting th,at the mi.grants eom this ethnic cornmt\nity were defacto 

  rcâ¬ugecs. The higher level of trauma exposure am.ongst the temporary protection visa holders 

  is consisten.c wirh previous sludj.es suggesting thax unauthorized asylum seekers often have a 

  more signif cam tmuina history than authorized. re:hiugces. A particular irony of the Australian 

  response to rehgee crisis is that the more traumatized ai:e inore likely to be detained and 

  granded temporary protection ra.th,er than permanent proteaion. 

  In relation to PTSD, 4.2% (32) of the TPVs and 16% ofthe permmait residents 

  obtained scores above rh,e cutoff threshold, ARer controlling for tlie high.er level of trauma 

  exposure amongst TPVs thcy continued to display twice the risk for PTSD as petmanent 

  residents. This pravi.dcs atyriotojitcie evidcnce that temporary protection status may be 

  nssocislrecl wjlh the rnsintenancc o f  posttraurnadc stress reactions. 

  Table 5 presents the results Erom the nine item questi,onn&re assessing the extent t~ 

  which the TPVs and PRs had been distressd, in the previous week by intrusive l.hornghts, 

  images md nightmares ~ b O U t  the occurrence of future traumatic events. TPVs were 

  significantly more 1iLel.y to report baing distressed by each of.tlie assessed symptoms during 

  the previous week. Applying a similar cut-oXas used :for the HTQ, 62% (47) of TPV holders 

  compared to 8% (3) of pcmment residents were i.dentifiec1 with clinj,csLlly Sj,fpifiGlUIt Ievels 

  of anticipatoiy tra.umntic stress. Thi.s represents a 16 fold itxcreasc in ri.sk affer adjusting for 

  level of trauma, and provides evidence to s ~ p o r t  the argum.ent that TPV hold.ers are kept in a 

  chronic state dmiticiparory stress. 

  The heightened level of anticipatory stress may account ,For the observation by torture 

  and muma services thro~gho~t Australia,, ihai TPVs &e ~~n-respo~siv~ to standard neatment 

  inta-ventions. For example, treatments such as im.agincz1 exposure or tcstiinony therapy 

  14 

  appear to have a core stssrmption of sa;fety as a necessary prccond.ition for elTecliveness. It is 

  generally hypothesised that exposure leads YO a form of h.nbituzltion. to salient trauma cues. 

  With TPVs, howcvver, the future throd they face j,s real md represents a likely outcome. In

  course of temporary and permanent protection visa, holders is currently being undertaken by 

  the resenrcli tern to fLLrtlier investigate this possibility. 

  It should also be noted ihat h e  symptoms associated with iuilicipatory traumatic stress 

  appear to be more than just geiieraliscd anxiety. Results horn the Perm Statc Worry 

  Qwstionmire in the current study, why demonstrating significantly higher levels of 

  generalised worry amongst &e TPV holders (mean score TPVs = 56.4 coinpared to PRs = 

  50.0) found that TPV holders had worry scores that were still lower aim the scores obtained 

  by patients diagnosed with genet-aliscd mxiely disorder reported in the literature (mean = 

  63.8).’* 

  Final Thoughts 

  Repealed research undertaken amongst asylum seekers, detainees, temporary 

  protectioii visa holders and aulhoiised refugees, have indicated that all of these populations 

  are highly Immmatized and at iisk to ongoing mental illness. The evidence presented today 

  funher indicates that key goveimnent initiatives used io iiimage and indeed deter some of 

  these groups, p a i ~ i c ~ ~ a ~ l y  long term ~ e t ~ i l ~ o n  tmd the issuing of temporary protection visas 

  leads to the continuation and fiirther exacerbation of mental illness, The question that remains 

  1s 

  is how this iii.fomation can be used to convince the Federal Government to adopt alternative 

  strategies to the asylum :problem. I person.ally believe that a middle road is possible that 

  maintains a. commitment; to an orderly rehgee protcctioii program without caising 

  unnecessary harm to those who are sselciiig protection. The real danger here I believe, apart 

  fiom the immediate ham caused to the nsyl.um seekers, is h a t  the current strtilegy adopted by 

  the G o v m e i i t  to rninimise the mental hea1,l.h consequences o f  its polici.es, may inadvertently 

  ~ d ~ i n e  the seriousness With which mental health problems are understood in the broader 

  cormnunity. Th.is is an. issue t h t  I think we niwt con,tinue to advocate on, because if the 

  suffering o f  one group can be so easily dismi.ssed., then who knows what group will be next.
