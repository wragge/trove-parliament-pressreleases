 Increased Services and 13,000 Places for Refugees and  Humanitarian Entrants 

 Joint Budget Media Release with The Hon Teresa Gambaro MP  Assistant Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  

 Tuesday, 8 May 2007  

 “The Humanitarian Programme will be maintained at 13,000 places for 2007-08. This will comprise 6,000 places for the offshore refugee category and  7,000 places for the Special Humanitarian Programme and protection visas,”  said Mr Andrews. 

 “The offshore component of the 2007-08 programme will focus on Africa, Asia  and the Middle East. The target for the Woman at Risk category will remain at  10.5 per cent of the offshore refugee allocation,” said Mr Andrews. 

 “The 2007-08 Budget also delivers $209.2 million over four years to increase  support for recently arrived humanitarian entrants. This package will go  towards implementing key recommendations of the Australian Government’s  Interdepartmental Committee on Humanitarian Settlement, enhancing support  for recently arrived humanitarian entrants,” said Mr Andrews. 

 “The Australian Government is committed to supporting humanitarian entrants  to settle in Australia and become part of the Australian community. The first  month after arrival is the most critical time in the settlement process,” said Ms  Gambaro. 

 “This package delivers more resources to six Australian Government agencies  to assist the integration of humanitarian entrants. It promotes early integration  by providing greater encouragement and support to learn English, get a job,  commit to Australian values and take part in mainstream activities,” said Ms  Gambaro. 

 “Most humanitarian entrants arrive in Australia with no money, possessions or  social networks. $5.3 million will subsidise rental and utilities costs in the first  month after arrival under the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy,”  said Mr Andrews. 

 “Shortly after arrival, humanitarian entrants need to enrol in English language  classes, school and training and look for work. $3.2 million will fund the 

 provision of public transport tickets to entrants in the first month after arrival to  help them get to these services,” said Ms Gambaro. 

 The package also includes; 

 â¢ $12.2 million in additional funding to the Programme of Assistance for  Survivors of Torture and Trauma;   â¢ $6.4 million to provide access to Crisis Payment for humanitarian  entrants on arrival in Australia;   â¢ $1.5 million to establish a small discretionary fund to support the long 

 term, sustainable settlement of refugees in regional areas, particularly  where there are employment opportunities; and   â¢ $0.4 million to encourage new interpreters in community languages  where there are significant shortages.  

 “In 2005-06, some 42 per cent of humanitarian arrivals were of school age,  with an average of only three years of education prior to arrival. For these  students, early support to learn English is vital to improve their education and  job prospects. 

 $127.8 million over four years will be provided to government and non-government education authorities, effectively doubling the Australian  Government’s contribution to the achievement of English language proficiency  for humanitarian entrant students in our schools,” said Ms Gambaro. 

 “The Australian Government believes in assisting those most in need. Over  four years, $35.2 million will be provided to establish Complex Case Support  services to deliver specialised and intensive case management to entrants  with exceptional needs beyond the scope of existing settlement services,” said  Mr Andrews. 

 “A new Proposer Support Programme will also be established with funding of  $16.6 million over four years to strengthen the capacity of proposers to  support SHP entrants,” said Mr Andrews. 

 “Since 1996, more than 100,000 people have come to Australia under the  Humanitarian Programme. Australia has consistently ranked among the top  three resettlement countries, alongside the United States of America and  Canada, in the numbers resettled each year,” said Mr Andrews. 

 “The Australian Government is committed to responding to humanitarian  crises around the world and delivering comprehensive services that enable  new entrants to settle and become part of our community,” said Mr Andrews. 

 Background 

 Since 1996, over 100,000 people have come to Australia under the  Humanitarian Programme. The Government is committed to supporting  humanitarian entrants to settle in Australia and become a part of the  Australian community. The Government is continually looking at ways to  improve services for humanitarian entrants. 

 In April 2006, an Interdepartmental Committee (IDC) of Australian  Government agency heads was convened to develop measures to strengthen  Government support for recently arrived humanitarian entrants. 

 The 2007-08 Budget provides an additional $209.2 million over four years to  Australian Government agencies to implement key IDC recommendations and  enhance services for humanitarian entrants. 

 These measures promote successful integration through increased English  language tuition for young humanitarian entrants in schools; supporting  settlement in regional locations where there are employment opportunities;  specialised case management for those with exceptional needs; increased  funding for torture and trauma counselling and connecting new arrivals to  mainstream Australia. 

 $62.7 million over four years will be directed to the Department of Immigration  and Citizenship (DIAC), with the following funding to be directed to other  Australian Government agencies: 

 â¢ $128.3 million to the Department of Education Science and Training  (DEST)   â¢ $12.2 million to the Department of Heath and Age (DoHA)   â¢ $0.2 million to the Department of Families, Community Services and 

 Indigenous Affairs (FaSCIA)   â¢ $4.2 million to the Department of Employment and Workplace  Relations (DEWR)   â¢ $1.6 million to Centrelink  

 Strengthening requirements for Special Humanitarian Programme  Proposers - DIAC 

 $16.6 million over four years will be provided to establish minimum  requirements for people seeking to propose people under the Special  Humanitarian Programme (SHP). Minimum requirements will ensure  proposers understand their obligations and have the capacity to provide  support to entrants on arrival. 

 This measure includes: 

 â¢ $10.3 million over four years to establish a Proposer Support  Programme to engage community groups to assist potential proposers  who do not meet minimum requirements with proposing and supporting  SHP entrant  

 â¢ $0.6 million over four years for information products to inform recently  arrived humanitarian entrants about the SHP, the roles and  responsibilities of proposers and support available.

 Increased funding for humanitarian students under the English as a  Second Language - New Arrivals Programme - DEST 

 $127.8 million over four years will be provided to government and non-government education authorities to increase the Australian Government  contribution to the provision of intensive English language tuition for  humanitarian entrant students. The funding will be provided to support  intensive English language tuition for those humanitarian entrants who enrol in  Australian primary and secondary schools. 

 The Humanitarian Programme’s focus on those in greatest need has seen an  increase in the amount of time these students need to spend in intensive  English language tuition. This will effectively double the per capita rate of  Australian Government funding for humanitarian students.

 Helping new arrivals connect to Australia - DIAC 

 $10.9 million over four years will be provided to strengthen support for  humanitarian families in the initial settlement period and help them become a  part of the Australian community, including: 

 â¢ $1.5 million to establish a small discretionary fund and improve data  capture of employment and skills history to support the long term,  sustainable settlement of refugees in regional areas, particularly where  there are employment opportunities;  

 â¢ $5.3 million to increase assistance for humanitarian entrants with rental  and utilities costs in the first month after arrival under the Integrated  Humanitarian Settlement Strategy;  

 â¢ $3.2 million to provide public transport tickets to humanitarian entrants  in the first month after arrival;   â¢ $0.5 million to share best practice and encourage the further  development of policing initiatives to educate new arrivals on Australian 

 law and build positive relationships between police and humanitarian  communities; and   â¢ $0.4 million to encourage new interpreters in community languages  where there are continuing shortages of interpreters.

 Improving Financial capacity of humanitarian families - FaCSIA, DEWR,  DEST and Centrelink 

 $6.4 million over four years will be provided to provide access to Crisis  Payment for humanitarian entrants at the point of arrival in Australia. Most  humanitarian families arrive with no money, possessions or social networks.  This funding will help address the financial hardship faced by families in their  first weeks by providing a one-off cash payment equivalent to a one-week  income support payment.

 Complex Case Support for humanitarian entrants with exceptional needs  - DIAC 

 $35.2 million over four years will be provided to establish Complex Case  Support services to deliver specialised and intensive case management to  recently arrived humanitarian entrants with exceptional needs. The support  will be provided on a needs basis to a small number of humanitarian entrants  where pre-migration experiences, severe torture and trauma or crisis events  after arrival present significant barriers to successful settlement beyond the  capacity of existing services.

 Increased Services and 13,000 Places for Refugees and Humanitarian Entrants 

 Humanitarian settlement initiatives - sustainable regional settlement 

 Why is this important? 

 â¢ Labour shortages in many regions of Australia present the opportunity for business to  improve employment outcomes for humanitarian entrants and address labour needs,  particularly in primary industry. 

 â¢ A need has been identified for funding to train local service providers and build community  support for settlement. 

 â¢ Funds will also facilitate the capture of the employment and skills data of humanitarian  entrants to improve capacity to settle them in regions with employment opportunities that  match their skills. 

 â¢ Evaluations of regional settlement initiatives will fine-tune arrangements in existing  locations and influence future settlement. 

 Who will benefit? 

 â¢ Humanitarian entrants will benefit from a better match to employment opportunities. 

 â¢ Regional areas will benefit from a larger pool of people to address potential labour  shortages. 

 What funding is the government committing to the initiative? 

 â¢ $1.5 million over four years. 

 What have we done in the past? 

 â¢ In the past, humanitarian entrants have predominantly been settled in major metropolitan  areas to take advantage of better availability of specialist and mainstream services.  

 â¢ In recent years, the department has sought to increase regional settlement in a coordinated  manner by identifying towns that have the capacity to assist humanitarian entrants.      In 2005-06 about 1,100 humanitarian entrants settled in regional areas. 

 When will the initiative conclude? 

 â¢ This is an ongoing initiative. 

 

 

 Increased Services and 13,000 Places for Refugees and Humanitarian Entrants 

 Humanitarian settlement initiatives - increased in-kind support 

 

 Why is this important?  

 â¢ This proposal will relieve the financial pressure on humanitarian entrant families by  removing the contributions they currently make to utilities and rental costs and providing  public transport tickets for the first four weeks after arrival. 

 

 Who will benefit? 

 â¢ Humanitarian entrants will benefit through reduced financial stress and a greater ability to  focus on other settlement priorities such as learning English and finding employment.  

 

 What funding is the government committing to the initiative? 

 â¢ $8.5 million over four years. 

 

 What have we done in the past? 

 â¢ Previously families have been required to make a rental contribution of up to 30 per cent of  their household income and a utilities contribution of $5 per family member (to a maximum  of $25 per family) for weeks two to four after arrival. 

 

 When will the initiative conclude? 

 â¢ These changes, which will be implemented by the end of 2007, are an ongoing initiative. 

 

 

 

 

 

 Increased Services and 13,000 Places for Refugees and Humanitarian Entrants 

 Humanitarian settlement initiatives - changes to the Special Humanitarian Programme (SHP)  proposer system 

 

 What is the Special Humanitarian Programme (SHP)? 

 â¢ The offshore component of Australia’s Humanitarian Programme has two categories: 

 - the Refugee category, which is fully funded by the Australian Government, assists people  who are subject to persecution in their home country and for whom resettlement to Australia  is the best durable solution 

 - the Special Humanitarian Programme which assists people who are subject to substantial  discrimination amounting to gross violation of their human rights. 

 â¢ Applications for SHP visas must be nominated by a proposer who is an Australian citizen,  permanent resident or eligible New Zealand citizen or an organisation operating in  Australia. Proposers are expected to provide SHP entrants with assistance and support, in  cooperation with Commonwealth-funded service providers. This includes assistance with  costs of travel to Australia, meeting entrants when they arrive, assisting with initial  accommodation needs and helping with the initial orientation of new entrants.  

 Why is this new measure important? 

 â¢ The capacity of SHP proposers to help meet the settlement needs of SHP entrants can be  significantly affected by a range of factors including a proposer’s own length of time spent  in Australia, their personal financial situation and their understanding of the workings of  Australian society. 

 Who will benefit? 

 â¢ SHP entrants will benefit through improved support upon arrival which will assist their early  integration into Australian society. 

 â¢ SHP proposers will benefit through initiatives to ensure they understand their obligations  and have the capacity to provide support to SHP entrants on arrival. 

 What funding is the government committing to the initiative? 

 â¢ $16.6 million over four years. 

 What have we done in the past? 

 â¢ Previously there have been no minimum requirements for SHP proposers.  

 When will the initiative conclude? 

 â¢ This is an ongoing initiative. 

 

 Increased Services and 13,000 Places for Refugees and Humanitarian Entrants 

 Humanitarian settlement initiatives - connecting to Australia 

 Why is this important? 

 â¢ The measure will share best-practice and encourage the further development of policing  initiatives to educate new humanitarian arrivals about Australian law and build positive  relationships between police and humanitarian communities. 

 â¢ Financial incentives will encourage potential interpreters to gain accreditation or recognition  from the National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters, to address  shortages in interpreters in the languages spoken by recent humanitarian arrivals.  

 Who will benefit? 

 â¢ Humanitarian entrants will benefit from a greater understanding of Australian law and  greater access to interpreters in key community languages. 

 â¢ The Australian community will benefit from improved integration and greater social  cohesion. 

 What funding is the government committing to the initiative? 

 â¢ $900,000 over four years. 

 What have we done in the past? 

 â¢ All policing jurisdictions have initiatives in place to build positive relationships with  humanitarian entrants. This measure will share effective strategies across jurisdictions. 

 When will the initiative conclude? 

 â¢ This is an ongoing initiative. 

 

 

 

 Strengthening Australia’s Borders 

 Combating trafficking in persons - extension and expansion 

 Why is this important? 

 â¢ The work of the senior immigration official in Bangkok in profiling syndicates and potential  victims of trafficking has been a crucial element in restricting the incidence of people  trafficking to Australia. 

 â¢ The appointment of two more senior officials will expand and enhance this work.  

 Who will benefit? 

 â¢ The Australian community through restricting people trafficking to Australia. 

 â¢ Potential victims of people-trafficking. Information obtained will be used by the offshore  and onshore network to develop profiles of people-trafficking activity and stop it at its  source. 

 What funding is the government committing to the initiative? 

 â¢ $3.3 million over four years. 

 What have we done in the past? 

 â¢ The senior official’s position in Thailand has been a key part of the whole-of-government  strategy. 

 â¢ The officer’s work in vetting the immigration caseloads to Australia and engaging  stakeholders has resulted in people-traffickers being charged and brought to trial in  Australia. 

 â¢ The role has also acted as a deterrent to potential traffickers in Thailand.  The work of the  official in profiling syndicates and potential victims of trafficking has assisted in stopping  people traffickers from accessing visas for Australia. 

 When will the initiative conclude? 

 â¢ Funding is ongoing. The senior official positions will be reviewed internally.
