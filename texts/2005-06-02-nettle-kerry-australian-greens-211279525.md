 Senator Kerry Nettle  Senator for New South Wales 

 Reducing asylum appeals means more forced  deportations: Deported Iraqi dies in Baghdad 

 2nd Jun 2005 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today warned that moves to restrict court  appeals by asylum seekers will lead to more forced deportations often  to dangerous situations.    

 “Today we have information that an Iraqi asylum seeker returned from  Nauru in 2003 has been killed in Baghdad This case highlights the  potentially tragic consequences of returning asylum seekers," Senator  Nettle said.   

 The Iraqi man was working as an interpreter when he was killed by  unknown attackers. His photograph was seen on Iraqi television and  news of his death relayed back to friends in Sydney.   

 "Had this man been allowed to come to Australia he would surely be  alive today. If Peter Costello's plan to deport asylum seekers sooner  succeeds then these tragic consequences may become more common.   

 "Does Peter Costello really want to remove legal rights and risk  increasing injustice so people with valid claims are forcibly deported  back to persecution or death?   

 “Peter Costello has missed the point - there is no need for people to be  held in detention while their cases are processed.  Asylum seekers can  and do live in the community whilst their claims for asylum are  assessed.   

 "The government should take note of the public mood and move  toward a more compassionate policy rather than seeking to restrict  asylum seeker’s rights even further."
