 SUBJECTS: Labor Party policy costings; refugee intake

 JOURNALIST:

 Treasurer, do you agree with Greg Barns that there is a groundswell in the Liberal Party for an increase in the refugee intake?

 TREASURER:

 Let me just make my opening comments, and then by all means go on to the questions.

 It is now clear that Mr Beazley has promised $10.2 billion of promises, almost the same amount as the $10 billion hole that he left in the Budget, in the course of this election campaign. It is also clear that he has no capacity at all to fund those promises because he is engaging in a whole series of funny money schemes which just don’t work. Funny money schemes in relation to the raiding of Telstra, funny money schemes in relation to the raiding of public service superannuation. And I call on the Labor Party to actually submit the really contentious policies for costing, because the Labor Party is not submitting its so-called savings and funny money schemes for costing by the Finance and Treasury Departments. The funny money schemes in relation to the Reserve Bank, the funny money schemes in relation to public service superannuation, the funny scheme in relation to internet in Australia Post, have not been submitted by the Labor Party for costing. These costings take five days, and they are holding it back so that it can’t be done before the election. Come clean Mr Beazley, put those schemes in, have them costed, and come clean with the Australian public about the fact that your whole electoral program now relies on a funny money scheme to try and get it across the post.

 JOURNALIST:

 What about the refugee question then?

 TREASURER:

 Well, sure.

 JOURNALIST:

 Well, do you agree with Lynton Crosby that there is a groundswell of opinion within the Party for the refugee intake level to be increased?

 TREASURER:

 Well, not Lynton Crosby, Greg Barns.

 JOURNALIST:

 Sorry, Greg Barns.

 TREASURER:

 Take three, do it again.

 JOURNALIST:

 Greg Barns, sorry.

 TREASURER:

 Do it again.

 JOURNALIST:

 Do you agree with Greg Barns…

 TREASURER:

 That?

 JOURNALIST:

 …there is a ground swell within the Party for the refugee intake to be increased?

 TREASURER:

 No I don’t. I don’t think Mr Barns is right about that at all. Greg Barns is somebody who publicises his opinions to anybody who will take some interest in them, but he does not speak for the Liberal Party. I don’t think he knows the Members. I don’t think he knows their views at all. And it is not for Greg Barns to speak on behalf of other Members of Parliament, they can speak for themselves, and I must say to you, as the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, somebody who has sat through all the Cabinet meetings and all of the Party meetings, there has been absolute

 strong support for the stand that the Government has taken, the Prime Minister has taken, and the policy which we are pursuing.

 JOURNALIST:

 (inaudible) 12,000 for the next 3 years?

 TREASURER:

 I think 12,000 is the right amount. That is the Government’s policy. I don’t believe that the 12,000 refugee intake needs revision. I certainly believe that it is the appropriate amount.

 JOURNALIST:

 That won’t be reviewed during the next term, won’t be changed?

 TREASURER:

 I don’t think it will be changed in any significant respect. I think it might bounce, it, 12,000, you know, that might be, bounce around by one’s or two’s, or something like that, but it won’t be any significant change to 12,000.

 JOURNALIST:

 Can you explain Greg Barns’ comment and Julie Bishop’s comments in the recent days, that the policy needs to be changed?

 TREASURER:

 Well, Greg Barns is somebody who is running for a pre-selection in a State seat of Tasmania. If he were successful and he were elected to the Tasmanian Parliament, he would have no influence over immigration policy. It is not a matter for the Tasmanian Parliament, and it is not a matter for, to be set by the Tasmanian MP’s. And certainly it is not a matter that is set by candidates for pre-selections, or elections, for State Houses. He is a long way from the action.

 JOURNALIST:

 (inaudible)

 TREASURER:

 Sorry?

 JOURNALIST:

 …(inaudible) Julie Bishop have influence on immigration policy?

 TREASURER:

 Julie, I believe, fully supports the Government’s policies, as I said yesterday, and I think she has made that clear.

 JOURNALIST:

 But she is saying we take more, you’re saying the limit stays at 12,000. There is a difference there?

 TREASURER:

 Well, I think Julie put out a statement yesterday and she said that she fully supports the Government’s policy.

 JOURNALIST:

 What changed her mind? Did you chat to her?

 TREASURER:

 I think that Julie probably took the view that she had been misrepresented in relation to the article. Anyway, she has clarified her position, that is a matter for her. As far as the Government is concerned, the Government believes the refugee intake, of approximately 12,000, is the right amount. That is the Government’s policy. That is what we have in place and that is what we will keep in place.

 JOURNALIST:

 Did you speak to Julie Bishop?

 TREASURER:

 No. Julie is perfectly capable of forming her own mind and stating her own views.

 JOURNALIST:

 Can I just get back on costings? The Government has come up with this $10 billion figure which is way over Labor’s $4 billion figure. How do you explain the gulf between those two?

 TREASURER:

 Well Labor has made promises of $10.2 billion. That is what its promises are. It then says it has a whole lot of funny money schemes which will reduce the cost of implementing those by producing off-setting savings. The trouble is, these funny money schemes involve raiding the Reserve Bank for dividends which it hasn’t earned, taking public servants’ superannuation, under costings in relation to Australia Post, and a whole lot of other issues which it won’t submit to the Finance and Treasury Departments for costing. Now, you can’t just put in the policies that you think will be checked off. You have got to put in the serious costing policies to the Departments. They won’t put them in, these funny money schemes.

 JOURNALIST:

 Bob McMullan says he doesn’t understand how you came at that figure, that you must be double counting everything to arrive at anywhere near $10 billion?

 TREASURER:

 Well, just for the information of Bob McMullan, he could arrive at an understanding of his own policies too, if he looked up his website and added up all his promises. The new promises from the Labor Party’s website are $10.2 billion. Now, Mr McMullan may find that inconvenient, but he knows precisely where it comes from. It comes from his website. That is the cost of the new policy promises by Mr Beazley. Mr McMullan then wants to say, "Ahh, but we have some funny money schemes. And once we have put in place some funny money schemes we will be able to get savings." The only trouble is, the funny money schemes haven’t been given to the Finance and Treasury Departments for costings. And these funny money schemes, the kind of schemes that we saw from State Labor Governments back in the eighties. Beazley has got all these promises out there and he is now relying on funny money schemes to try and implement them. The only thing you could say for Australia is let’s hope he never gets the chance. Let’s hope he never gets the chance.
