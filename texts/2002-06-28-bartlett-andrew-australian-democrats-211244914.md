 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 28 June 2002     MEDIA RELEASE                          02/344

 Woomera - the farce continues The assisted escape of 39 detainees from the Woomera Detention Centre once again highlights the mismanagement of this facility, according to the Australian Democrats.

 Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett said, “Put the blame on Minister Ruddock where it belongs, not on the asylum seekers or their supporters.  Having visited Woomera, I am simply astonished that so many people have been allowed to escape.”

 Around the time of the escape the Senate was hotly debating the legalities of the Federal Government’s latest restrictive measure, the Migration Amendment (Procedural Fairness) Bill, which was passed unamended in the early hours of Friday morning with the ALP’s support.

 Senator Bartlett said the Federal Government’s mishandling of the asylum seeker issue with its focus on punitive and restrictive measures sees detainees growing more desperate and anxious and those that support them, more frustrated.

 “In recent days, we’ve heard of a number of people at the Woomera Detention Centre renewing their hunger strikes and sewing their lips together. These are acts of absolute despair.

 “Although we don’t condone these actions nor the assisted escape of detainees, we understand the motives behind them and those of their supporters,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “Australians need to remember that the majority of detainees are forcibly incarcerated for extensive periods of time, held against their will and not in accordance with the United Nations conventions.

 “Just yesterday the Human Rights Commission tabled two more reports where incidents involving detention were found to have breached human rights obligations.  Irrespective of how they enter the country, asylum seekers have the legal right to seek asylum under the United Nations conventions, to which we still subscribe.

 “Some detainees wait years in the hope of being recognised as a genuine refugee, only to see their claims and appeals for refugee status tossed aside. Federal laws change, growing more restrictive, during the course of their detention; their opportunities for appeal or the ability to monitor the quality of the refugee determination restricted at best, at worst it’s denied,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “Further restrictions, lack of transparency and the denial of natural justice will result as a consequence of the latest Bill; natural justice will be excluded as a ground of appeal to the courts on any migration decision. Instead, a very restricted code of procedure will take its place.

 “But there’s a very real possibility that future court interpretations of new parts of the Migration Act - pushed through the Senate before the last election - may result in there being no right of appeal even if the code of procedure is not followed,” Senator Bartlett said.

 “Earlier this month, Mr Louis Joinet, head of the UN’s detention centre delegation to Australia, reportedly said: ‘…(he had) not seen a more gross abuse of human rights in more than 40 inspections of mandatory detention centres around the world’. That was then; by late June, it’s far worse…it’s criminal,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
