  Australia PM told: Tampa actions are illegal 
and an act of war 

  

 The International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) 
today warned the Australian Government that its actions in turning away 
the vessel Tampa are illegal under international treaties to which the 
country is a signatory. The trade union body has delivered a   letter  to the Australian Prime Minister advising him that his 
Government was in clear breach of the Safety of Life at Sea Convention, 
the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, and the 
UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees - even before it took 
military action that could leave it open to a charge of committing an 
act of war.

  

 The ITF has also repeated its urgent warning that 
the Australian Government's action risks setting a dangerous precedent 
that could fatally undermine all future rescues at sea. Effectively 
making ships' captains responsible for deciding whether they can go 
to the assistance of vessels in distress and who is a genuine asylum 
seeker endangers the existing system, by which seafarers must help in 
emergencies and then allow the relevant national authorities to decide 
on questions of immigration, it says.

  

 The ITF also warned the Australian Government that: 
'the unwanted and unrequested occupation of the sovereign territory 
of Norway - a friendly country - by Australian soldiers is dangerously 
irresponsible. It is difficult to see how this, let alone any use of 
troops or a frigate to turn around the Tampa, is anything less than 
a technical act of war. Were it to have been carried out on the high 
seas, rather than in territorial waters, there would be a good case 
to be made for calling it piracy.'

  

 David Cockroft, General Secretary of the ITF, commented 
today: "There is a legal case and there is a moral one too. Like 
it or not Australia must abide by its humanitarian duty and accept these 
migrants. Until then it is endangering everyone on board the Tampa - 
including the innocent crew members whose only mistake appears to have 
been to respond responsibly and promptly to an Australian call for assistance.

  

 "Deploying camouflaged, body-armoured commandos 
to deal with a few hundred dehydrated civilians is using a very large 
sledge hammer to crack a nut - though I've never seen a sledgehammer 
armed with silenced sub-machine guns before. "

  

 He concluded: "It's true that Australia has been 
handed something of a poisoned chalice by Indonesia, but the difference 
is that Australia is a responsible maritime state that has signed these 
treaties and Indonesia isn't - as is shown by its appalling behaviour 
and all too evident failure to police its waters and tackle the horrible 
trade in human lives."

  

 The unions to which the Tampa crew belongs and the 
Maritime Union of Australia (which has branded the use of troops to 
board the Tampa "a deplorable invasion") are affiliated to 
the ITF.

  To: The Prime Minister of Australia, Mr John Howard

  From: David Cockroft, General Secretary 

 30 August 2001

  

 Dear Prime Minister,

  

  I believe it is my urgent duty to advise you and your government that 
its refusal to allow the migrants on board the vessel Tampa to  
disembark on land places Australia in breach of international conventions 
to which it is a signatory. It also endangers the members of the ship's 
crew, who have done nothing more than comply fully with their responsibility 
to aid a ship in distress. Additionally I must advise you that even 
the military action undertaken so far is dangerously close to the definition 
of an act of war.

  

 Australia's actions so far put it in breach of the 
following international conventions, which are the keystones of international 
maritime governance:

  

  

  These inf ringements must be placed alongside the apparent flouting 
of Australia's obligations under the 1951 UN Convention Relating to 
the Status of Refugees. It is difficult to see how any course of action 
other than allowing the migrants on the Tampa to land (ready for processing 
by the relevant national authorities) is compatible with Australia's 
continuing in its position as a member of the Council of the International 
Maritime Organisation (IMO) - a body whose central concern is the safety 
of life at sea.

  

 As well as these matters we feel obliged to put on 
record that the unwanted and unrequested occupation of the sovereign 
territory of Norway - a friendly country - by Australian soldiers is 
dangerously irresponsible. It is difficult to see how this, let alone 
any use of troops or a frigate to turn around the Tampa, is anything 
less than a technical act of war. Were it to have been carried out on 
the high seas, rather than in territorial waters, there would be a good 
case to be made for calling it piracy.

  

 We are mindful of the difficult position in which 
your country has been placed by the appalling behaviour of Indonesia 
and its refusal to effectively crack down on the horrible trade in people 
smuggling and to police its own waters. However, unlike Indonesia, Australia 
is a signatory of all these conventions and has until now been recognised 
as a state with a proud tradition of maritime excellence. That its Government 
seems willing to jeopardise that reputation by risking people's lives 
for short term domestic political gain is abhorrent.

  

 I sincerely hope that you will pass on this message 
to your Government, and that it will take heed of the rising number 
of voices around the world calling on your nation to act in accordance 
with both its humanitarian duty and its well known reputation for fairness.

  

 Yours faithfully,

  

  

 David Cockcroft,

 General Secretary
