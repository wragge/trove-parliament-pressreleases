 $124,000 IN GRANTS FOR MIGRANT SELF-HELP PROJECTS

 Project grants totalling $124,050 to 34 ethnic and community  organisations throughout Australia were announced today  by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Stewart West.

 The grants are made under the Migrant Project Subsidy  Scheme, which provides once-only subsidies of up to $10,000  for projects in the field of migrant welfare.

 "The grants awarded under this Scheme are important tools  for initiating self-help programs within ethnic communities,  and for improving migrants' access to and involvement in  the delivery of welfare services," Mr West said.

 "The Scheme is an appropriate way for the Government to  assist those with special needs, such as migrant women  and migrants in industry. It also aims to benefit smaller  and more recently established communities which are less  likely to attract funding under other grant schemes.

 Organisations which are interested in applying for subsidy  grants under the Scheme should contact the Regional Office  of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in  the capital city of their State."
