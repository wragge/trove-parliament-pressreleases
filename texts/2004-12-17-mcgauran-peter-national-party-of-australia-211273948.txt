 More Help For Migrants in The Moreland Area

 17 December 2004

 Migrants will benefit from a new centre opening in Coburg , the Australian Government Minister for Citizenship and  Multicultural Affairs, Peter McGauran, said today.

 Minister McGauran said the co-location of the Northern Migrant Resource Centre and Moreland Adult Education would  play an important role in helping people settle in the Moreland area.

 ‘The new office at 13 Munro Street Coburg means that when migrants need to find out what services are available or learn  English they need to go to only one location,’ Minister McGauran said.

 ‘The northern suburbs of Melbourne attract high numbers of new migrants and refugees. This new centre means they will  quickly become familiar with settlement services, government systems, community and culture.’

 Minister McGauran said assisting new arrivals quickly settle into their new home benefited all Australians.

 ‘The sooner people realise their potential and their goals and feel like they belong the sooner the whole country is able to  benefit from their skills and expertise,’ Minister McGauran said.

 ‘The new Coburg centre will help people realise this potential.’
