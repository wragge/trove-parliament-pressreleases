  Media Release 

  Ursula Stephens urges the community to  support UNICEF’s ‘School-in-a-Box’ campaign  31st January 2005 

  Senator Ursula Stephens today called on the public to support UNICEF’s ‘School-in-a-  box’ campaign to provide practical help to children affected by the Boxing Day  Tsunami’s. 

  The UNICEF ‘School-in-a-box’ has been used by UNICEF since the mid-1990s. The aim  of the pack, which contains supplies and materials for a teacher and up to 80 students,  is to meet the temporary educational needs of communities affected by disaster or those  that had been displaced. The pack itself, which became an important tool during the 

  refugee crisis in Rwanda in 1994 and again most recently in Afghanistan in 2003, costs  $280 to produce and is produced to meet the specific language and educational needs  of the students in each location it is sent. 

  ‘UNICEF’s ‘School-in-a-box’ is a valuable way of providing much needed educational  material and equipment to young students affected by this shocking natural disaster’  said Senator Stephens 

  ‘Materials provided in this kit will go someway towards the rebuilding process associated  with schools damaged or destroyed in the Tsunami. Importantly these kits also allow for  classes to resume much sooner for students - something which may otherwise have  taken months whilst waiting for the rebuilding to be completed’ 

  ‘I urge individuals, communities and the business community to get behind this important 

  campaign.’ 

  Further information on the ‘School-in-a-box’ campaign is attached and donations can be  made by visiting UNICEF’s website www.unicef.ora.au or calling the donation hotline on  1300 884 233.
