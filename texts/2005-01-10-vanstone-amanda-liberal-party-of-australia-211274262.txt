 Most Arrivals in a Decade to Victoria

 VPS 011/2005

 Victoria attracted the largest number of migrants and refugee entrants in a decade in 2003-04, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and  Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today.

 More than 28 000 people arrived and settled in Victoria in 2003-04, an increase of nearly 5000 from the previous year’s total of 23 109.

 ‘The increase is in line with a general upwards trend over the past decade - in 1993-94 just 16,000 settlers arrived in Victoria,’ Senator Vanstone  said.

 ‘This means that in the past 10 years Victorian arrivals have increased by over 76 per cent and the national increase has been 60 per cent, with well  over 200 countries represented.

 ‘Australia has a wonderfully rich and diverse society as a result, with nearly one in four of Australia’s 20 million people born overseas.’

 Australia-wide, the largest number of people came from the United Kingdom (18 000), followed by people from New Zealand, China, India, South  Africa, the Sudan and the Philippines.

 ‘On top of these figures are the growing numbers of people becoming permanent residents after arriving in Australia, such as overseas students  who apply for skilled migration onshore,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘Our ongoing commitment to new and innovative visa programs and the increased efficiency and integrity of immigration processing means that  Australia continues to attract more and more people from around the globe,’ she said.
