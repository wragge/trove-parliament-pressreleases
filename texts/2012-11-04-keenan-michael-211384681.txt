 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling FLOOD OF BOAT ARRIVALS CONTINUES  UNDER LABOR November 04, 2012

 The unprecedented flood of illegal boat arrivals continues as it becomes increasingly clear that Labor cannot solve this  problem, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 "The criminals behind people smuggling have watched the Labor Party for over four years and they have their measure,”  Mr Keenan said.

 "They understand that Labor is incapable of setting a course and following through with it once they come under pressure.

 "Time and time again Labor has blinked in its battle with people smugglers from the Oceanic Viking debacle through the  latest instances of our border protection forces being used as water taxis.

 "It takes resolve and it takes the ability to set a course of action and stick with it in the face of opposition, to deter people  smugglers.

 "They need to see that you are deadly serious about stopping them before they will abandon their lucrative trade.

 "It is impossible for Labor to now build up the credibility required to do this.

 "Labor is the problem.

 "They gave the kiss of life to a people smuggling trade that had been defeated and they have provided incentives for  these criminals to continue with every failed policy,” Mr Keenan said.
