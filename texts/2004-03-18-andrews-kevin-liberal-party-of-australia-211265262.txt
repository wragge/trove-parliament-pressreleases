 New Project To Help Arabic-Speaking Young People In Melbourne Find Jobs

 ARABIC-speaking young people in Melbourne will receive help to find jobs under a new Australian Government  project.

 The Employment Innovation Fund project will provide outreach activities, counselling, personal development  workshops and mentoring to these young people.

 Participants will be helped to find work through the Job Network and other employment service providers. 

 Arabic-speaking young people in northern and western suburbs of Melbourne are among the most disadvantaged  groups looking for work.

 Many are at risk of long-term unemployment. They are from refugee backgrounds and have had disrupted schooling. 

 They will receive training in resume writing, interview skills and personal development and will be given advice and  mentoring to help them prepare for work.

 The aim is to boost their self-esteem and self-confidence so they are better placed to find jobs.

 A project officer from the Victorian Arabic Social Services will also be involved in the project, which is a joint  initiative with the Victorian Government. 

 Information will also be available for parents.
