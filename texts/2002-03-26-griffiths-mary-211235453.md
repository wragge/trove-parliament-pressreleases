 Australian e-Democracy?: Its Potential for Citizens and Governments

 Presentation at Innovative e-Government for Victoria. Hotel Sofitel, Melbourne. 26 March, 2002.

 Abstract

 When  new  technologies  converge  with  deliberative  liberal  democracy  (as  opposed  to unreflective  populism)  it  requires  a  re-thinking  of  the  relations  between  citizens  and governments;  a  re-engagement  of  citizens  in  public  spheres,  particularly  at  local  level;  and purposeful  decisions  from  all  levels  of  government  to  use  technology  to  further  the acquisition  and  development  of  democratic  literacies.  Local  government  web-sites  can become e-democracy portals for a newly invigorated public sphere.

 1. Questioning  a Familiar Hypothesis: High NCT Uptake + Politics= e-Democracy.

 There is a great deal of hype, world-wide, about the democratic potential associated with new communication  technologies  (NCTs),  particularly  the  rapid  spread  of  internet  connectivity, among increasing uses of other converging technologies. The “electronic” part of “electronic democracy” has  become a kind of talisman over the last five years. Yet although the mantra is frequently repeated - “ Everyone is wired, is about to be wired, or will be by 2005” - the fact  is  that  Internet  growth  is  slowing  in  developed  countries.  Digital  divides  aren’t disappearing, just changing.i  There are turning out to be wired or unwired pockets in many places  rather  than  a  frontier,  according  to  regular  Benton  Foundation  “newsbites”  gathered from around the world. A lack of Internet literacy in those who are wired, in the US, is now seen as just as serious a problem as lack of access. Finally, while Internet users are thought to be incorporating the Internet in to their daily routines ii, there isn’t a lot of evidence to show that they are ( as  a matter of course, and on a large scale) fundamentally altering their initial uses of the technology in order to include citizen engagement with government.

 Even so there’s an assumption, because vast numbers of people are on-line and because the momentum of e-government is accelerating, that this will automatically create the likelihood of  e-democracy.  Kellner,  and  others  since,  have  argued  that  computers  are  a  “potentially democratic  technology.”iii  Given  the  on-line  presence  of  news  media,  access  to  converging digital  entertainment  technologies,  populism  in  the  public  sphere,  and  the  prevalence  of instrumentalist  and  determinist  approaches  to  on-line  government,  it  is  timely  to  consider whether - of itself - high NCT uptake by individual citizens, businesses and governments in developed democracies automatically means e-democracy, or enhanced democracy? Are we taking enough  account  of  the  democracy  part  of  e-democracy?  Are  NCT  trainings  and expectations  driving  the  development  of  democratic  relations  between  governments  and citizens?  In  particular,  do  Internet  users  operate  in  ways  which  governments  might  find difficult to manage, thus creating situations where what government offers might be seen as irrelevant? Many have started to wonder. Pippa Norris, for example, notes that governments and  civil  society are  providing a  “cornucopia of  information on  the  World  Wide Web”  and asks “- but who is paying attention?” iv

 Democracy aims to achieve a significantly different set of relations between people than that constructed in either e-commerce or e-government. Yet it is sometimes difficult to tease apart

 2

 the  nuances  of  these  relations,  which  supply  some  of  the  more  volatile  features  of democracies  like  Australia  -  globalised  and  media-saturated  information  economies.  High expectations flourish in governing circles, and also among the governed, when governments talk  about  new  technologies  as  providing  the  means  to  ensure  greater  transparency  and accountability, more direct engagement with constituents, better consultation practices and so on. Some of this faith is not misplaced when it refers to the raft of sensible ways in which the process of fulfilling certain responsibilities as a public servant, or an elected representative, or a citizen becomes easier when technology is used, e.g. when,

 - services are offered on-line - details of citizen obligations and rights are readily available - citizen advice is provided about services - legislation is published and circulated.

 Initial  on-line  uses  by  government  like  these  are  not  all  that  technology  can  do  to  enhance democracy, and developments occur everyday, but e-democracy progress is a lot slower than the expectations raised by the speed and spread of Internet connectivity. Steven Clift, a global on-line  democracy  strategist,  (Minnesota  Online  Democracy  Project)  sounded  a  cautionary note recently about having very much higher hopes of on-line technologies just yet:

 The research community is just starting to evaluate alternative approaches that get beyond the generic approach of ingredient A - Internet, ingredient B - politics - stir, pour into election pan, bake for three months - oops, no revolution, see the Internet does/doesn't make a difference. v

 I’d  agree.  As  with  any  other  technology,  specific  uses  determine  social  and  political outcomes.  And  potential  outcomes  depend  on  technologies  being  developed  which  are  in keeping with the shared values of citizens and governments - policy makers and users.

 2. Citizen Disinterest

 Clift’s comments refer primarily to the hope expressed in the US that providing greater access to political engagement through technological means would result in a higher participation in the ballot. Pre- September 11 in the US, where there’s a voluntary voting system, that would naturally have been regarded as a major sign of a democracy recovering from cynicism and disengagement. Trust in democratic processes and practices has waned and needs invigorating -  not  only in  the  US  -  but  although  democratic  processes  and  practices  are  seen to  need  a charge  of  energy  from  somewhere,  the  worry  is  that  perhaps  a  love  of  technology  and  its gizmos,  for  their  own  sake,  will  end  up  driving  online  processes  rather  than  serving democratic outcomes.

 Citizen disinterest is a recognised feature of many established democracies, but it is beyond the scope of this paper to speculate about the possible causes, except to note that this debate informs  much  of  the  Utopian  thinking  about  the  Internet’s  democratising  potential.  Media reports of citizen apathy are being published regularly in the West. The various body politics in Western democracies, and particularly the young, are growing disenchanted with the way politics is conducted, and with politicians. Sometimes, it is noted, the cynicism extends to the country’s political institutions and to democracy itself. This is recognised as a dangerous state of affairs, given the rise of fundamentalism and populism globally. A few weeks ago, it was reported in The Australian that, when participating in a civics study of 28 countries,

 [t]he Australian Council for Educational Research found half of Australian students had no grasp of democracy, which ranked them behind countries like Poland, Cyprus and the Slovak Republic.vi

 It  is  not  news  to  those  who  teach  tertiary  students  that  general  knowledge  about  the  civic, historical or political formations and institutions of Australia can be minimal.

 Electoral turnout in voluntary voting democracies is low - only 50% in the last US Federal election - this, in a nation with extensive programs in civics education of the kind which are not offered here, despite the availability of an excellent Centenary of Federation Discovering Democracy teaching resources kit developed for primary and secondary schools.

 There are wider questions to be asked about the internet+politics equation of more relevance to  Australia  than  the  one  suggested  by  Clift’s  comment  on  elections.  Compulsory  voting means  that  elections  in  Australia,  along  with  Australia  Day,  might  be  two  of  the  few occasions  when  citizens  are  called  upon  formally  to  think  of  themselves  as  citizens,  rather than  members  of  communities,  workers,  or  members  of  families  and  organisations.  Whilst some experimentation has taken place with electronic voting - most recently in Canberra at selected  booths  -  there’s  a  compulsory  voting  system  for  all  levels  of  government  which means that citizens don’t need to be persuaded to vote. If competent, they are obliged to do so by law. Recent mailed information about an upcoming council election in Melbourne carried the familiar reminder - voting is compulsory for residents, optional only if the voter is over 70.vii But, compared to the US, there isn’t seen to be the same need to experiment with new technological applications on a wide scale in that arena of political life. Collection of opinion through e-polling, like telephone polling, is frequently conducted by organisations other than government such as Newspoll, Nielsen or media businesses; and organised e-petitioning, such as  has  occurred  in  Scotland  of  behalf  of  the  region,  tends  to  be  used  by  lobby  groups  and issues-based coalitions such as the Refugees Action Collective.

 Funding of government services at local level has been focussed on the provision of on-line citizen  services  and  customer  information,  experiments  with  “have-your-say”  on-line feedback, and the development of other features of local government web sites. At state level, infrastructure funding has seen excellent commitment to building a citizen IT skills base and networking opportunities. At a drafting stage, State policy consultation online has taken place (e.g.  South  Australia’s  WorkCover  draft  policy  on  workplace  bullying),  supplementing  the usual requests for citizen input which are advertised in the daily press or on radio.

 There  is  a  good  deal  going  on,  but  much  of  what  is  on-line  appears  to  result  not  from  a purposeful strategic plan for e-democracy, but often happens in an ad hoc fashion - possibly when  funding  becomes  available  to  enthusiasts  in  a  position  to  act  upon  their  excitement about  the  potential  of  technology  (i.e.  wired  mayors,  IT  officers,  local  government  CEOs, community leaders, activists). Sometimes necessity drives the desire for an on-line presence, as in the case of a region, or city council, wanting to sustain regeneration activities with the help of venture capital.

 Victorian policy, at the moment, appears focussed on bridging the digital divide by building IT skills in the community, providing access, and on outreach such as helping the development of community and business web-sites through: â¢  Skills.net - more than 50,000 Victorians receiving Internet training and access, â¢ VEEM - funding 39 councils to develop e-commerce projects among local businesses

 access@schools - 146 schools in rural areas to provide after hours community Internet access â¢ Regional Connectivity Project - six centres in western Victoria providing Internet training and access with an emphasis on e-commerce, â¢ My Connected Community - funding for community groups to develop their own

 websites, â¢ Libraries Online - provides Internet access at more than 900 work stations in public libraries across the state.viii

 The  Queensland  Government  has  come  up  with  what  appears  to  be  the  most  “joined-up” Australian response to e-democracy, outlining an ambitious three-year initiative. The policy statement reads:

 The Internet is not inherently democratic, but it can be used for democratic purposes. The full implications of how the Internet will enhance this interaction are yet to be explored. The strengths of  this new technology are many. The characteristics of the Internet  which  support  e-democracy  include  :  timeliness  -  the  opportunity  to participate  in  debates  as  they  happen;  accessibility  - participation  is  less  limited  by geography, disability or networks; and facilitation - individuals and groups can access information  and  provide  input  which  previously  has  often  been  restricted  to organisations which had the resources to respond to government.

 The  Queensland  Government's  three-year  e-democracy  trial  will  give  effect  to  its commitment  to  extend  opportunities  for  community  participation  in  the  democratic process  via  the  Internet.  Initially,  access  will  be  available  through  the  Government Gateway  website  for  people  to  comment  on  specified  issues  on  which  the Government desires feedback. ix

 This looks like a good kick start: government is taking a lead in setting up controlled ways of letting new processes converge with traditional means of governing and citizen participation.

 3. Australian Democracy - Accepting the Civil Contract

 Reading different government web-sites around the world, it becomes clear to the surfer that a US president is not needed to help blur distinctions between democracies around the world, and the futures they see for themselves. Globalisation, and Internet technology as a particular tool of globalisation, tends to homogenise the differences between democracies, just as Internet technology flattens out the authority of expert knowledge as opposed to opinion in chat forums, and tends to bring with it ways of behaving which are peculiar to on-line activity. It is a feature of the technology - P2P - that it can disguise its organisational structures and hierarchies, despite the history of its formation as an open-access, freedom of information preserving, “flat” communication tool. Government web-sites from all over the English speaking world tend superficially to look the same, they have roughly the same compositional, textual features, and architecture, and are more or less constructed according to in-house benchmarks, and best practice citations from external e-democracy watchdogs. No government official wants to win an international “big brother” award for an undemocratic tendency in the use of technology: recognition from the Electronic Frontier Foundation as a “pioneer” is preferable.

 Yet, historical, societal, cultural, and political characteristics make Australian democracy different, even from those with whom we share a language and some history and traditions. A representative democracy is more than a sum of a history of legislation, the workings of existing political and judicial institutions, and what Benedict Anderson called the “horizontal fellowship” - a nation. Identifying and enhancing the civic and democratic values shared by a polity is crucial if e-government is to develop into e-democracy. Different kinds of belonging are the crux of the matter, “[I]ndividuals move between ethical codes and regimes, just as they move between duties, allegiances, rights and entitlements”x  and this is even more accurate when virtualised relations are so mobile. In the English language as opposed to French, as Calhoun points out, there’s confusion about the difference between citizenship and nationality. There is also confusion in everyday usage about which group of people is meant by a “community”, a “polity” and a “public.” xi

 Centenary of Federation celebrations sharpened the dialogue about who we think we are as a nation in Australia. This debate was already being focussed by the 1975 constitutional crisis, reconciliation debates, the republic referendum, and is now again gaining momentum with the current discussions about the continuing relevance of the monarchy, the role of the embattled Governor General, and the events following Tampa. Australia as a polity is likely to change in the next few years. It is a republic waiting to happen… a majority of Australians have typed in the URL, but the web site is still “under construction.” And as a nation, community and a polity?  Donald Horne points out to The Australian’s “public” some interesting features of national imagining in a piece introducing a NSW Centenary Committee booklet, 2001, Why Are We Celebrating? He argues that there is a crucial difference between two groups of democratic citizens, the Americans and the Australians:

 Americans  see  an  attachment  to  the  civic  values  of  their  political  system  as  a fundamental  test  of  what  it  means  to  be  an  American.  Not  so  Australians.  When Australians commemorate themselves, they are strikingly less likely than Americans to  speak of  shared  civic  values. When  they seek something they can  all  share,  they speak not of civic values but of the land - not in terms of salinity or new research or commodity exports but in terms of myth.

 Urging the importance of thinking beyond the familiar jingle “We are one but we are many,” he argues:

 [m]any is easy. What we should talk about next year is one. Must we go on forever with  simple  stereotypes  about  being  typically  Australian?  Or  can  Australian  simply mean accepting the civic contract that provides the unity in our diversity - the rule of law, liberal-democratic government, free speech, the ideals of tolerance, equality and fairness, a concern for general well-being.

 There’s nothing simple about “accepting the civic contract.” It is a difficult task because it requires the development and practising of civic and democratic literacies.xii  It can be made more accessible as a useful concept for helping a polity function if the democratising features of technology are purposefully taken up, particularly at the regional or local level, where democratic literacies can best be initially encouraged.

 4. Local Government Web-sites: Here and Elsewhere.

 How does one develop democratic e-literacies? What are Australian citizens’ expectations of government  and  governments’  expectations  of  citizens  in  a  wired  environment?  Before discussing that, let’s look at what is happening elsewhere and whether any activity looks as if it  might  be  beneficial,  and  transferable  to  the  Australian  polity.  Examples  from  other jurisdictions  show  that  innovative  solutions  to  the  questions  which  interest  e-democracy enthusiasts everywhere can be found at :  eLaunceston; www.hants.gov.uk; Local Government Association,  UK;  Toronto  City  Hall;  Joe’s  Feedback  and  E-Mail  List,   and  others. eLaunceston  is  a  good  example  of  a  live  site,  which  takes  full  advantage  of  the  available technology - Daily News, Quick Poll, Open Chat, and dynamic content. Word of the Week comes  from  the  new  Mayor,  “Janie.”  Hampshire  County  Council  in  the  UK  is  proactive  at push technology , it was an active  participant in Local Democracy Week and publishes a link to  telephone  poll  feedback  results  as  a  read  only  (pdf)  brochure  on  the  LGA  site:  a  good example  of  “joining  up”  institutions,  publics  and  technologies.  Toronto  City  Hall  site demonstrates  a  real  interest  in  getting  people  to  engage,  while  one  of  its  councillors,  Joe Mihevc  runs  his  own  web-site  giving  detailed  information  on  his  background,  affiliations, which  legislation  he  has  been  instrumental  in  effecting,  and  offering  subscription-based dynamic interaction with constituents.

 Sometimes  in  the  head-long  rush  to  wire,  there  prove  to  be  conceptual  difficulties  over exactly what constitutes, and enhances, democratic practice, and what more properly belongs in the realm of e-commerce or e-government. Briefly,

 e-commerce : refers to relations of exchange - any-sized commercial transaction on-line, it is frequently linked to social regeneration in the new economy

 e-government:  refers  to  relations  of  top/down  power  -  governing  populations through use of on-line information and services, it is often thought to be a-political or more “uninvolved” than

 e-democracy:  refers  to  relations  of  two-way  and  horizontal  power  -  using technologies to enhance democratic practice

 Take  the  rapid  development  of  Victorian  local  government  web-sites  as  an  example  of government reaching out to citizens. All three discourses, practices and relations can be seen at  work.  A  survey  of  all  VLG  sites  is  at  an  early  stage,  and  some  web  pages  have  already altered substantially since we began two months ago, but of the 20 surveyed so far, what is emerging is a mixed bag of news for e-democracy watchers. It is obvious that there are large differences  between  council  web-sites  in  aim,  function,  outcomes  and  level  of  engagement with citizens. Available funding obviously impacts here, but also different values are driving the  allocation  of  funds.  The  design  of  the  web-site  can  be  said  to  represent  a  local government’s view of its relations with the groups it represents and how it sees its place in the global information society. The web-site also constructs political and social relations between local government and citizens, and between citizen and citizen.

 At  one  end  of  the  scale,  e-commerce  often  appears  to  be  the  primary  focus  of  many  local council web-sites, making some of them look little more, effectively, than the local business directory  on-line.  This  information  should,  of  course,  be  provided  on-line  by  local government,  but  can  e-commerce  principles,  and  the  relations  they  construct  between consumers  and  providers  stand  in  for  all  the  relations  which  could  be  developed  between governments at all levels and citizens? Government has appropriate interests in e-commerce, and  local  government  would  be  abrogating  its  duty  if  it  was  not  concerned  with  attracting venture capital, or keeping its revenue providers in a vital state.

 Some councils surveyed have combined an  e-commerce and e-government track. Developing what  might  be  called  a  web-site’s  “gloss  factor,”  the  branding  of  the  council  with  a  bright logo has been prioritised, along with an identifying catch phrase and map. Subsequent pages identify  councillors  and  ward  boundaries,  put  the  business  directory  on-line,  and  provide information about bye-laws. Sometimes on-line payments are possible. The kind, amount and currency of content varies, with a few councils having quite a limited on-line presence, rather like a e.dot point on a Virtual VLGA map. In some cases, where council minutes are provided on-line, they sometimes offer little more than the agenda and sometimes so cryptically in fact, that, democratically speaking, they are of little use to those wanting to participate more fully. (In  these  circumstances  it  would  be  better  democratic  practice  if  a  secretary put  out  a user-friendly report  on  which citizens  could  click  - instead  of  Council Minutes - which detailed what  was  at  stake  for  the  citizens  of  the  local  government  in  council  decisions.  If  this happened before council meetings, as a citizen e-briefing, so much the better.)

 Other  local  governments,  genuinely  adventurers  on  the  e-government/e-democracy  frontier, have embraced a more radical experimentation with on-line engagement. There are web-sites with one or more of the following components: more detailed information about the history and ethnic composition of the community; the community languages spoken; (these answer the  question  -  “who  are  we?”);  election  information  and  the  councillors’  background, interests,  and  email  addresses  (answering  the  question  “what  is  the  system,  who  is  our

 7

 representative and how effective is she/he?”; current addresses by the Mayor, strategic policy directions,  addresses  to  venture  capital  (“clear  directions being set  for  the  common  good”); job/tender  vacancies,  youth  services,  the  welfare  service  available,  e-service  options (evidence  of  effective  joined-up  responses  for  the  common  good);  finally,  media,  business, and government links, and links to the twin city’s web-site (evidence of “positioning us in the globalised information world”).

 Others  go  further  down  the  e-democracy track with  pre-council  meeting briefings,  IT  skills promotion and training in, for example, web design, Have Your Say pages, feedback requests and  they  provide  people  who  will  respond  on-line,  sometimes  within  24  hours,  to  citizen queries.  As  yet  we  have  not  found  much  evidence  of  Internet  push  technology  (subscriber email lists, or volunteer Citizen Panels who discuss proposed changes to bye-laws and so on.)

 We initially focussed on taking a descriptive and comparative approach to the sites surveyed so far, looking firstly at the detail of information provided on :

 - Council

 -  constituencies

 - tourism

 - client services

 - service directory

 - community groups - infrastructure information - e-commerce and regeneration

 Next we are starting to consider the usefulness of the site to all citizens in that jurisdiction by using a  developing “e-democracy indicator.”   Design,  ease  of  access  and use, awareness  of likely differences  in  access,  uptake,  and literacies  in  a  constituency,  substantive  attempts  at consultation, opinion collection - these all indicate the democratising use of technology at the local level. Thus the survey looks at  :

 - Browser/user compatibility ( sites surveyed work more easily on Explorer) - consideration  of  technology  available  to  users  -  download  options:  pdf  or html - links  - to where, and are they working? - consideration of IT literacies of users  - “how to” information - levels of interactivity offered - questions answered; feedback given - dynamic nature of content - frequency of updates - explicit democracy or being a citizen information .

 So far there have been few sites which mention democracy, and most of those which mention citizen or  citizenship  refer  to  the  actual  ceremony  of  allegiance  (Frankston  as  an  excellent information page). Sometimes a keyword search turns up the use of the word democracy in a report of a councillor’s speech, whereas citizen engagement usually means the volunteering of time and expertise on the part of the citizen. Interactivity does not appear to be widespread as yet, although Greater Dandenong and Knox, for example, give ample opportunities for user-feedback. Community, news and youth pages existed on sites which took a more community-friendly as opposed to consumer-oriented approach to their constituencies. In a society which prides  itself  on  its  multicultural  nature,  it  is  concerning  to  see  that  even  in  councils  with  a high  proportion  of  recent  migrants,  information  about  council  services  are  not  routinely offered in languages other than English. Again, funding is a likely reason.

 For a web-site construction team, and later implementation and support groups, holding every necessary  component  in  delicate  balance  is  a  complex  task  in  which  thinking  about community, polity and publics play a part, as well as negotiating the discourses and practices

 8

 which  come  from  e-commerce,  e-government  and  e-democracy.  But  is  too  much  being expected  of  local  government?  In  the  UK,  local  councils  are  having  second  thoughts  about their  presence  on  the  web  according  to  a  recent  Guardian  news  report,  with  one  London borough chief executive wondering “Is it really in our interest to put loads of information up for free, as if we were Guardian Online?” (A UK national policy strategy for e-government is in the offing).

 5. Citizens Expecting a Lot - The Dispersal of Political Power

 Getting  on-line  means  that  all  kinds  of  information  and  connectivity  are  possible.  If newspapers  and  broadcasters  offer  chat  forums,  databases,  entertainment,  polls,  and  the customising  of  information  through  portals  such  as  newspapers  (  “The  Daily  Me”  as  one writer has named it). How can web-sites of the kinds described above compete for attention? Those  who  are  technologically  literate  are  a  ready  made  potential  public  for  on-line democracy  but  how  likely  is  it  that  the  large  numbers  of  people  who  use  the  Internet  for commerce, work, study or entertainment will use it for political engagement? Given that more than 50% of the Australian population is wired, although data from NOIE indicates that the uptake  is  uneven,  especially  in  the  regions  and  certain  metropolitan  areas,  why  are  they getting on-line? People are finding new, and faster, ways of connecting, locating and sharing information,  selling  and  buying  on-line,  comparing  their  situations  with  that  of  others, forming  communities  of  interest  sometimes  across  national  boundaries,  mobilising  social capital and political clout, and educating themselves. Many people use computers at work, are part of networks, and receive global daily company or institutional emails.

 Any and all of these activities empower people. Despite this proliferation of uses, it’s worth remembering that most users probably originally bought their pcs to store and manipulate text, xiii or do business on-line. The initial reasons are only super-ceded by others when higher levels of technical literacy are acquired. Often new uses occur by chance, whilst surfing. Only then do they become everyday and ordinary, as skills build. For everyone online, this routine connectivity  is  not  restricted  to  getting  in  touch  with  people  inside  national  frontiers,  but opportunities  to  connect  are  on  offer  around  the  world,  crossing  national,  cultural,  ethnic, political and religious borders giving some credence to the more philosophical analyses of the changing relations  between  humans  and  machines  that  one  can  find  in  the  work on  notions about  new  political  spaces  such  as  “Cyberia”  and  “netizens,”  or  “cyborgs”  rather  than citizens.  The  Internet  provides  speedier  and  effective  person  to  person  contact,  networks, search  engines,  data  bases,  libraries,  web  boards,  web  cams  -  a  raft  of  pull  and  push technologies.  Why  would  citizens  need  to  be  coaxed  by  “cookies”  or  quizzes  to  come  to  a local council portal? What would bring them is the promise, and reality, of increased political power - if, for example, by participating, they could make a difference to the governing of the place to which they belong. E-democracy is more than e-government. It  requires more than acquiescence on the part of citizens, and tolerance on the part of government.

 6. Free Flows and Ungovernability?

 Democratic  watchdogs  such  as  civil  liberties  organisations,  politicians  themselves,  citizen bodies  and  civil  institutions  want  greater  participation  in  government  to  take  place.  New electronic tools for governing and democratising a polity could exist peacefully alongside the traditional and non-virtual. This might prove a paradox, because one of the key attractions of the  Internet  is  its  un-governability.  One  can  manoeuvre  around  existing  mainstream gatekeepers (publish on-line), side-track traditional power brokers (get around secretaries by emailing politicians direct), exchange controversial information ( lobby groups have used this extensively),  and  negotiate  new  political  alliances  (local  unions  are  forming  international alliances  for  cross-border  campaigns)   -  and  do  all  this  seemingly  detached  from  material

 9

 places,  histories  and  responsibilities.  This  virtual  terrain  provides  fertile  ground  for visionaries and dreamers!

 But, the idea that one can move into the purely virtualised is a very misguided view, and an unhealthy one  to  take  up,  unchallenged,  in  a developing democracy with  growing access  to on-line technologies, and a government willing to spend at local, State and national level on wiring its public service, politicians and citizens. “Technology is not inherently democratic.”

 The  dispersal  of  political  power,  resulting  from  the  widespread  distribution  of  information through non-traditional channels, can worry governments. The same electronic means which assist  consumers  to  participate  in  e-commerce,  or  workers  to  find  gain  skills  and  work through knowledge networks, also provide citizens with the capacity to regroup, lobby, and resist  government,  both  within  and  across  national  boundaries.  Heightened  and  shared security  concerns  since  September  11,  surveillance  responsibilities  in  tracking  trans-border crime,  and  the  need  to  construct  the  conditions  in  which  national  and  international  social harmony exist,  have  meant  an  increase  in  interest  at  all  levels  in  developed democracies  in using  technology  to  stabilise  social  and  political  relations.  Increased  information  circulated from  government  about  government  to  citizens  is  being  seen  increasingly  as  not  only  a response  to  a  democratic  citizen  right,  but  also  as  engendering  a  citizen’s  responsibility  to participate, in orderly ways, in political life.

 7. Maximum Devolution to Local Government: Public Spheres, and Democratic Literacies, in the Choice of Discussion Display.

 If, as Scholte argues, the potentially negative social and political effects of globalisation can be countered by “maximum devolution to local government” and  “raising the credentials of civil  society”  in  order  to  gain  “a  more  human  future,xiv”  then  the  local  government  portal could be the way that citizen disinterest is turned around. It means government has to give up power to citizens. It’s worth remembering that the majority of citizens stick to every kind of accepted rule and convention, every day of their lives.

 Democratic  literacies  are  practised  in  civic  engagement,  especially  when  power  is  shared. Public virtual spaces can be established at the local level through the inclusion of  volunteers on  citizen  panels,  offering  a  sounding  board  for  prospective  local  government  policy formation.  Raising  knowledge  about  democracy  could  take  place  more  purposefully,  for example,  by  holding  e-democracy  weeks  in  which  live  on-line  chat  could  take  place  with local  historians  or  political  studies  teachers,  or  representatives  of  local  political  parties. Voluntary publics can be set up such as “the recipients of emailed council minutes” or  “those who  have  registered  to  receive  current  council  advice  on  their  special  interest,  e.g. “Alzheimer’s carers support” or “those who want the Mayor’s weekly letter emailed to their BH address.”

 Discussion  boards  could  be  developed  to  move  beyond  the  simple  exhibiting  of  individual messages  to  a  council  representative  or  “the  Council”,  recorded  chronologically  in  a  linear fashion. Even though each message can be read by others, and usually gets a response (e.g. Virtual  Moreland,  Latrobe  City’s  Have  Your  Say),  the  method  of  visual  display  does  not illustrate where a discussion is heading. Open Source software exists which, in the way it lays out  emailed  comment,  visually  represents  the  interest  and  support,  or  opposition  to,  ideas raised  in  discussion  (e.g.  cipherwar  discussion).  In  real  or  off-line  committee  meetings, democratic  literacies  are  being  demonstrated  everyday  -   waiting  one’s  turn  to  speak, speaking  to  the  point,  summarising  argument,  using  reason  not  invective,  listening  to  one's fellow citizen and the chair, voting, living with decisions one doesn’t like, still  greeting the people with whom one disagrees, and accepting the committee's decision. On-line democratic literacies  need  to  be  even  more  carefully  practised.  Being  succinct,  addressing  substantive issues  directly,  not  flaming  or  wasting  the  time  of  other  citizens,  not  personalising  issues,

 asking  for  accountability  in  a  courteous  manner,  -  these  are  all  a  "civic"  version  of  the "netiquette" familiar to many of us. If such collective behaviour isn't encouraged, there might be  a  tendency  just  to  ignore  the  diversity  of  others.  If  there’s  no  need  to  engage  with  that diversity, on a routine basis, then there is little democratic learning going on, in terms of the making the civil contract work at either an individual or collective level. Single P2P feedback emails  actually  encourage  individuality.  The  work  of  imagining  an  on-line  opponent  as  a fellow  citizen  in  a  democratic  debate  is  made  easier  if  technologies  are  chosen  which demonstrate  the  shifts  of  argument  in  action  and  person  to  person  response,  through  the “trees”  of   Web  board  messaging  systems.  Seeing  the  process  depicted  on  the  screen  as  it takes  place,  over  perhaps  a  few  days,  aids  on-line  deliberative  democracy.  In  the  end,  one may have to acknowledge that one’s argument is lost, and need to demonstrate a measure of democratic  literacy by acknowledging the  (healthy)  difference  from oneself  of  one’s fellow citizen.

 This  contrast  between  outcomes  in  choosing  one  on-line  application  over  another demonstrates that one has greater potential to strengthen the shared values underpinning the civil contract. Well-constructed feedback forms, useful as they are in planning and in giving citizens  a  chance  to  air  their  views,  are  just  a  first  step.  Voluntary virtual  commons  are  the next step and they can be developed from civil, reflective discussion groups. If the horizontal fellowship  on  which  the  civil  contract  depends  is  to  be  successful  on-line,  people  need potentially powerful places to practice their literacies.
