 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling RUDD’S ENDLESS TALK MEANS 100,000  MORE ILLEGAL BOAT ARRIVALS, AT  CURRENT RATE July 10, 2013

 Eighty one more people on the latest illegal boat continues the trend under Kevin Rudd’s policy free zone on our borders,  which if continued for another three years will see 100,000 more people coming to Australia on illegal boats, at the current  rate of arrivals, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs  and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “While Kevin Rudd talks and talks and talks boats continue to arrive at record levels,” Mr Morrison said.

 “A new three year term under Kevin Rudd would bring over 100,000 people on illegal boats on current arrival rates.

 “Kevin Rudd and Labor have given up on our borders. They don’t believe in strong border protection nor possess the will to  implement policies to achieve it.

 “Instead all Kevin Rudd will bring to the other side of the election is more boats with up to 100,000 people on board, based  on current arrival rates as well as endless cost, chaos and tragedy on our borders.

 “Australians face a stark choice at this election - between the Coalition which will act to stop the boats or more endless talk  and more boats under Kevin Rudd.

 “The time has come Mr Rudd for the election solution when it comes to deciding the policies that should be on our borders,”  Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “Since Kevin Rudd formed Government in 2007, there have been 46,621 people arrive on 757 illegal boats.

 “Yet Mr Rudd still refuses to take responsibility for the problem he created and currently has no policy apart from continued  surrender to the people smugglers.

 “This surrender policy has proved disastrous for the Australian people and for the people it encourages to come to Australia.

 “The Labor Government’s arms remain wide open to the evil people smuggling trade.

 “The Labor Party have had ample opportunity to admit the failure of their current approach and to change course but they  refuse to do so.

 “Only a change in government will stop the boats,” Mr Keenan said.
