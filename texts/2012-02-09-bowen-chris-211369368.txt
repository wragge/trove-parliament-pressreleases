 Chris Bowen MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 Changes to Ministerâ€™s Advisory Council  Thursday, 09 February 2012 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, today  announced he has extended the term for his Council for Immigration Services  and Status Resolution (CISSR), which will now be known as the Minister's  Council on Asylum Seekers and Detention (MCASD). 

 'The council's new name more accurately reflects its focus on issues relating  to asylum seekers and immigration detention,' Mr Bowen said. 

 'For example, the council has played an important role in areas such as  community detention and mental health in detention.' 

 Mr Bowen said he had extended the council's term to September 2014 and  made some changes to its terms of reference to clarify its legal status. 

 'I'd like to thank all of the existing members who have accepted my invitation  to continue to serve on the council, and welcome Associate Professor Mary  Anne Kenny and Bishop Daniel Eugene Hurley to the council,' he said. 

 'I also extend my thanks to Professor Samina Yasmeen, who is leaving the  council to focus on her work at the Australian Multicultural Council. Professor  Yasmeen has made a valuable contribution to the council, particularly in  relation to the needs of different cultural groups within immigration settings.' 

 MCASD is an independent advisory council to the Minister for Immigration  and Citizenship which brings together experts from a range of disciplines to  inform policymaking.
