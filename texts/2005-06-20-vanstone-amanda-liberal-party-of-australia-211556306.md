 Eight Refugees to Become Citizens at Parliament House

 VPS 078/2005

 Eight refugees will celebrate World Refugee Day today by becoming Australian citizens at a special citizenship ceremony at Parliament House. 

 The Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, will preside over the special ceremony.

 ‘The citizenship ceremony will follow the theme of this year’s World Refugee Day - courage,’ the Minister said.

 Enormous courage has been shown by all of today’s conferees who have rebuilt new lives in Australia,’ the Minister said.

 ‘The conferees have all entered Australia under our Refugee and Humanitarian Program, from Sudan, Bosnia and Colombo and are cementing their  place as part of Australia by becoming citizens.

 ‘Australia has one of the largest dedicated refugee and humanitarian resettlement programs in the world, and I am delighted that these people have  built new lives and are now choosing to become full participants in Australian society.

 ‘In the past year the ACT has welcomed 131 arrivals under the Refugee and Special Humanitarian programs,’ the Minister said.

 ‘Citizenship is the unifying force in our culturally diverse society. The example shown by today’s conferees will hopefully encourage all those who  are eligible to take the final step and apply for Australian citizenship.’

 Citizenship information is available at www.citizenship.gov.au or from the Citizenship Information Line on 131 880.
