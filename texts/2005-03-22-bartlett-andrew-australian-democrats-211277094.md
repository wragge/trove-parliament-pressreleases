 Failure by Cabinet to Free Asylum Seekers Would Add to Suffering  

 A failure by Federal Cabinet to free asylum seekers from long-term immigration detention would  be an extra act of cruelty, given the raised expectations the Government has created.

 Democrats' Deputy Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said asylum seekers in detention are well  aware that Cabinet is considering the issue and will be devastated if no significant change  comes from the Cabinet meeting.

 "As someone who has been visiting asylum seekers in detention throughout the country for  many years, I know one of the cruellest things you can do is to raise their hopes and then not  follow through," Senator Bartlett said.

 "The Prime Minister has clearly allowed expectations to be raised that Cabinet will decide to  free long-term detainees and those asylum seekers are very aware of this."

 "Whilst they know from bitter experience and years of disappointments not to get their hopes  up, it would be impossible for many of them not to be hoping for good news today."

 "The Prime Minister continues to deceive the public when he says mandatory detention is a  cornerstone of the Government's 'successful' refugee policy. He knows full well there is no  evidence at all that mandatory detention has deterred a single asylum seeker from coming to  Australia."

 "Given the enormous suffering and torment that these people have already gone through as a  result of this Government's policies, there can be no excuse for causing more suffering by  inaction on this occasion."

 Since 1997, Senator Bartlett has called innumerable times in the Senate for a better deal for  refugees and asylum seekers and is the only federal politician to have visited detainees on both  Nauru and Christmas Island, as well as in every detention centre on the mainland.
