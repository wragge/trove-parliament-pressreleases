 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Thursday, 22 August 2013   

 Greens call for media access to offshore  detention camps   

 The Greens have today called for the media and independent human rights monitors to be given  access to the Manus Island and Nauru detention camps after the government’s release of a hostage-style video from inside the PNG camp.   

 “The hypocritical release of this footage calls into question the government’s current practice of  banning media from offshore detention camps,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator  Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Independent access from the media and human rights monitors is urgently needed to ensure  appropriate transparency.   

 “Without proper oversight we cannot be sure of what is really going on inside these cruel camps and  how refugees are being treated.    

 “This video has been released in the midst of a highly politicised debate. The department has let  their own cameras in and it’s no longer reasonable to ban the media from doing the same.    

 “I am extremely concerned for the welfare of the people locked up in these island prisons. It’s  essential that they have access to independent advice and support from humanitarian agencies.”
