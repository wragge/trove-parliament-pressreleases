 Government must wear blame for unnecessary tragedy of Kosovar Refugees The Australian Democrats say the trauma experienced by the Kosovar refugees who are being forced to leave Australia is completely unnecessary and due solely to a lack of compassion by the Australian government.

 “It is no good saying the Kosovar refugees should go home, when some have no home to go to,” according to Democrat immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett.

 The Democrats and others have repeatedly called, over the past twelve months, for the refugees to have the same rights as any other person on Australian soil, to apply to stay in Australia through the normal processes.

 "Last year the government insisted on passing unprecedented legislation aimed at giving them absolute control over the futures and lives of the Kosovars before they would allow them into the country. This is presently being challenged in the courts,” said Senator Bartlett.

 "Australia is one of the few nations who assisted the Kosovars at the time of the war last year, who are now refusing to give them any opportunity to apply for other visas and give them some control over their own future.

 "It is very distressing that the repeated warnings by the Democrats and others about the potential for suffering have been proved right.

 "It is becoming clearer every day that this government is lacking even the most basic sense of decency or compassion.

 "Mr Ruddock has total power over deciding the future of these people. He has structured the law so there is no avenue of appeal, no need to follow natural justice and not even any public criteria which the Minister must follow in deciding whether or not to listen to people's pleas."

 "It was only the force of public opinion which made John Howard offer to allow any Kosovars here in the first place," Senator Bartlett said.

 "As I said many times last year, the Prime Minister was quite keen to be filmed welcoming refugees from Kosovo into Australia. Will he be at the airport waving them goodbye when they are forcibly deported?"

 Australian Democrats Deputy Leader, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja who visited Albania at the height of the Kosovo crisis last year, has also expressed concern about returning people against their will to dangerous conditions. Senator Stott Despoja has been assisting some of the Kosovars remaining in Adelaide.

 Facts about the Safe Haven legislation, which was rushed through Parliament in April 1999 before any refugees from the Kosovo conflict would be allowed into Australia:

  The Minister's decision to cancel or refuse extensions of a safe haven visa can occur at any time and is not subject to any form of review or appeal.

  Despite the fact that Australia is obliged to offer protection to any people on our soil who meet the definition of a Refugee under the Refugee Convention, the Kosovars are not allowed to use Australia's independent legal processes which have been established to test claims of refugee status.

  Any claim by a Kosovar seeking protection under the Refugee Convention relies solely on the discretionary judgement of the Immigration Minister, with no right of appeal. The Minister is specifically exempted under the legislation from even being required to follow natural justice.

  Immigration Department officials have admitted that there are not even any guidelines developed which the Minister should use in deciding whether to exercise his discretion. (Senate Estimates, 1/12/99)

  Countries such as the USA, Canada and New Zealand all allowed Kosovars to apply for other visas (such as protection or refugee visas) while in the country. Australia was one of the few, if not the only non-European country not to provide this right.

  Mr Ruddock had openly criticised the idea of temporary visas for people fleeing the conflict only weeks before being forced to do so by Mr Howard. On 6/4/99 Ruddock was quoted on AAP as saying "temporary outcomes have never been successful in terms of moving people, locating them for a short period of time and then returning them."
