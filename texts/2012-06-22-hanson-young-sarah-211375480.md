 Australian Greens statement on asylum boat tragedy 

 The sinking of an asylum seeker boat north of Christmas Island yesterday is a tragedy, the Australia  Greens said this morning.   

 

 “Our thoughts and prayers are with all of those affected by this awful tragedy, and we hope that as  the rescue operation continues more survivors will be found,” Greens' immigration spokesperson,  Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, said. 

 “We express our support for the brave efforts of all Australian and Indonesian personnel involved in  the rescue effort. 

 “The Australian Greens reaffirm our commitment to the UN Refugee Convention and to onshore  assessment but today we must be focused on expressing our empathy and encouragement to the  rescue effort."
