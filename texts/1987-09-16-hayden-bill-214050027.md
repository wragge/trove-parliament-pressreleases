 No. m 121 Date 16 September 1987

 Further aid for Bangladesh flood victims

 The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, M r Bill Hayden, M.P., announced  today that the Australian Government will contribute up to a further  $1,000,000 in emergency relief to victims of the flood disaster in  Bangladesh that has already claimed hundreds of lives.

 Commenting on the emergency, Mr Hayden said that available reports  clearly indicate that the disaster is of an unprecedented scale. The floods  have worsened recently, affecting half of the country's population of 103  million and destroying property and crops on a massive scale.

 The additional funds will be used to provided up to 5,000 tonnes of  Australian wheat and medical supplies in the form of 5 million  water-purifying tablets and 43,000 cholera fluid bags. The emergency food  supplies are being channelled through the United Nations' World Food 

 Program (WFP). The medical supplies, which will be purchased in Australia  and Bangladesh, will be distributed by the Bangladesh Red Cross Society and  Australian non-governmental organisations active in relief operations in  Bangladesh.

 The funds will be in addition to the original $250,000 in relief funds that  were provided earlier this month.

 Africa's Front Line Stales are to benefit from a  three-year Australian development assistance  package worth $55 million, the Minister for  Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Bill Hayden, MP,  said today.

 Commenting on the program, which has been  included in the aid budget for 1987-88, Mr  Hayden said it was in keeping with Australia's  strong record of support for those African Slates  neighbouring South Africa.

 'The program underlines Australia's determina­ tion to support these countries which face military  and economic destabilisation Fry the South African  Government as a result of their support for the 

 inernation.il campaign against apartheid,' Mr  ITayden said.

 The recipients of the program w ill be the nine  members of the Southern Africa Development  Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) — Angola,  Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swazi­ land, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The  program will incorporate and make allowance for  the expansion of the already approved Special  Assistance Program lor South Africans and Nami­ bians which the Prime Minister announced in  August 1988. This program provides assistance to  South Africans and Namibians disadvantaged by  apartheid.

 Mr Hayden said a broad locus of the program  would be the promotion of food security which in  the longer-term would reduce the region s need  for food aid. Non-Government Organisations will 

 also be invited to participate in the program with  the preferred focus tor the NGC) activities being  village level agricultural and rural health projects.

 Mr Hayden said any emergency or relief .issu­ ance provided by Australia to the region would be  additional to this program.

 The Southern African program is part ol Austra­ lia's official aid program which is administeier A  t!GAustralian lU n a lio n a l D e v *,,m u n i Ass.s,-

 Australian aid program: 1987-88

 C. I. s.

 Australia w ill provide $1008 million for over­ seas aid in ils 1987-88 Budget. In money terms the  amount represents an increase of about three per  cent over last year.

 Commenting on the allocation, the Minister lor  Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Bill Hayden, MB,  said that despite difficult domestic economic  circumstances, the Government recognised that  the world's wealthier nations had a joint responsi­ bility to assist those who were less well off.

 The expenditure of more than $ I billion this  I financial year on Australian foreign aid reflects (he J· Government's commitment in supporting the ' international goal of development,' Mr ITayden

 said.

 Although the volume of the aid program in  1987-8 is expected to rise by about $32 million  over actual expenditure in 1988, the percentage  of aid to GNP w ill fall to about .36 per cent.

 Mr Hayden said the drop was due to the  expectation that Australia's economy would grow  faster than the increase in aid. Country programs  w ill have the biggest share of the aid program and  w ill account for $669 million in expenditure in 

 1987-88. Papua New Guinea remains by lar the  largest recipient of Australian aid with an es­ timated $300 million being provided as budget  support and jointly programmed aid.

 Assistance to the South Pacific countries will  fall slightly this year to about $68 million due to a  one oft payment of $8 million for the Tuvalu Trust  Fund in 1986-87 which inflated expenditure in  this region. Australia will meet in full its commit­ ment under the 1982 five year pledge of $300  million. Assistance to South Fast Asia will grow In  about 13 per cent this year to $118 million with 

 Indonesia ($43 million), Philippines ($24 million). Ihailand ($19.5 million) and Laos ($6 million) all  ret eiving additional funding.

 The Government's aid program is managed by  the Australian International Development Assist­ ance Bureau (AIDAB). Considerable changes to  both strut lure anti management methods over the 

 past few years are now in place from which the  Government expects an improvement in quality  and efficiency to be realized in coming years.

 Mr Hayden said that in response to the atfverse  domestic and international conditions affecting  much of Africa, the Government has initiated a  new three year program expected to lolal $55  million to assist the people of Southern Africa.  With expenditure this year of $15 million, this 

 program represents the largest percentage in­ crease in funds for any region in the Australian  program.

 The Government has also increased its assist­ ance to other regions which concentrate on the  economic sectors in which Australia has an  advantage. Economic food aid forms a major part  of Australia's programs in South Asia and Africa.  The importance of the China program has been  acknowledged with funding of $18 million while  assistance to Burma will be $11.7 million.  Australia provides a subsidised education for a 

 large number of students from developing coun­ tries. It is estimated that the subsidy w ill cost about  $85.2 million in 1987-88 for the more than  17 600 students receiving their education and  training in Australia. Expenditure on global prog­

 rams will rise in real terms to about $271  million  in 1987-88. A total of $40.4 million w ill be 

 provided to respond to emergency, disaster and  refugee situations including $ 17.5 million for food  relief.

 Mr Hayden said that in recognition of the  important community-based role played by Non­ Government Organisations (NGO's) in the Austra­ lian overseas aid effort, support for these bodies  would rise by almost 50 per cent in 1987-88 to 

 $10.6 million. To encourage more participation  by Australian business in the aid program, funds  for the mixed credit facility known as the 

 Development Import Finance Facility (DIFF) have  been almost doubled to $30 million in 1987-88.  There has been a modest increase in support for  some UN agencies including the UN Develop­

 ment Program (UNDP) (15 million), the World  Food Program (41.5 million) and the UN Chil­ dren's Fund (3.1 million).

 Australian contributions to international finan­ cial institutions w ill total more than $94 million in  1987-88. The International Development Associa­ tion (IDA), the highly concessional lending arm of  the World Bank, w ill receive the largest share ol  these funds with $70.4 million.
