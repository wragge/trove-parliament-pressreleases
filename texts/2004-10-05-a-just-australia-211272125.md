  A Just Australia 

  304 Candidates pledge a Just Refugee Program  In the clearest sign yet of how far Australia has moved from the dark days of the 200 1  Federal Election, A Just Australia today released the results of its survey of candidates  for this weekend’s federal election. 

  As campaign advertisements began to appear in 12 key seats this week, National  Director of A Just Australia, Howard Glenn, released the survey results at a media  briefing in Parliament House, Canberra. 

  “Our campaign theme is “let’s not let this happen again”, and we are delighted that the  survey results show that politicians and the community have moved so far,” Mr Glenn  said. 

  “There is now a group of people in every electorate across the country who has pledged  to keep the pressure on politicians. Candidates in all sorts of electorates have signed our  “refugee guarantee”, and have worked to overcome the dreadful government programs  invented to win the 200 1 Election. 

  “The existence of strong national human rights bodies, the public education of the last  three years, and rapid response to attempts to use refugees for political gain in the  campaign has made an enormous difference. This public mood shift has been reflected  in other opinion polls. 

  “We expected that there would be mine echoes ofthe 2001 distortion\. While there has  not been a lot of media attention. beneath the radar of the media, an enormous amount  of quiet firm pressure has been put on candidates. 

  Mr Glenn said that 270 candidates for tiouse of Representatives seats. and 34  candidates for Senate places had signed the refugee guarantee. He said it was  unfortunate that all but one Liberal candidates have followed the Liberal Campaign  Director’s instructions not to sign the guarantee, but other Liberal and National  candidates who had worked with A Just Australia were given a high grading. 

  Candidates were asked to sign the refugee guarantee, and to answer a questionnaire on  their actions over the last three years. Grades were made on the basis of their response.  and their involvement in campaign work in the last 3 years. 

  “The highest rating has gone to those who stood up to their party’s indifference, or who  worked hard for public understanding. I’m sure that this will be of benefit to the  Australian Democrats Senators who are seeking re-election, and to some of the  candidates in the most marginal seats”, Mr Glenn said. 

  “We have written to our 1 1,000 supporter base, and taken out advertisements in 43  papers across a dozen key electorates to advise our support base of the results.” 

  Howard Glenn will outline the results of the survey at Parliament House, Canberra, on  Tuesday 5 October, at 1 lam.
