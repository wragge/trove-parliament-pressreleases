 20 BOATS DUE TO COALITION NEGATIVITY   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said today’s interception of an asylum seeker boat carrying 19  passengers is the 20th since the Coalition failed to act to enable offshore processing.   

 Mr Bowen said a proper deterrent is needed to address the problem of irregular migration to  Australia.   

 “Both parties believe offshore processing is the best way to prevent dangerous boat  journeys and this stalemate has gone on for far too long,” Mr Bowen said.    

 “Asylum seekers coming to Australia by boat face very real risks and we need to work  together now to prevent another tragedy from occurring.”   

 Mr Clare said the boats would keep coming while Tony Abbott said no. 

 “Stopping this is within our grasp. Working together we can help stop people dying at sea.  We can pass legislation to introduce offshore processing,” Mr Clare said. 

 “If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must stop saying no and pass our  legislation to allow asylum seekers to be processed offshore in Malaysia and Nauru.”
