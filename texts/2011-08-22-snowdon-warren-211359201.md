 THE HON WARREN SNOWDON MP 

 Minister for Indigenous Health 

 22nd August 2011  

 25 NEW GRANTS TO SUPPORT MEN’S SHEDS 

 The Australian Government is funding new grants for twenty-five men’s sheds across the  country to purchase tools, conduct building and maintenance and employ shed co-ordinators.  

 The Minister for Indigenous Health, Warren Snowdon, who has responsibility for male  health, made the announcement at the 4th National Men’s Shed Conference in Brisbane.  

 “Men’s sheds have long been recognised as meeting places where men can find social  support and camaraderie. They can play a significant role in improving men’s heath and  wellbeing by connecting them with each other and their communities in a pressure-free  environment.   

 “Men often form friendships as they work together, doing things that are traditionally  done in sheds, like building furniture, fixing machinery and working on small projects to  help other local community groups. 

 “With Australian men still dying four to five years younger than women, we know we  have to support grass roots initiatives like men’s sheds to get males of all ages engaged in  ways to improve their health and wellbeing,” he said.  

 Mr Snowdon said Round Two of the Australian Government Shed Development Program  announced today is funding sites in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and  Tasmania up to $10,000 each. 

 Some of the successful recipients include Shed West in Queensland, which will use  funding, and skilled shed members, to make repairs to homes damaged from the  Queensland floods. 

 Also, Wagalgau Garkaziw Zageth Inc, located on Moa Island in the Torres Strait will  receive funding to purchase blocks, trusses, iron and cement to build an extension on the  shed for planned social gatherings to engage males in the area. 

 A number of the sheds will be funded to employ a shed co-ordinator to assist with tasks  such as overseeing and supporting projects to engage males in the shed environment or to  facilitate discussions with relevant and interested groups . 

 Mr Snowdon said there was considerable support expressed for these funded Men’s  Sheds during consultations for the National Male Health Policy.   

 “Men’s sheds’ demonstrated success in reaching marginalised and isolated males and  contributing to improvements in male health and wellbeing,” he said. 

 The National Male Health Policy included $3 million to the Australian Men’s Shed  Association (AMSA) to support Men’s Sheds across Australia, including $750,000 for  the Australian Government Shed Development Program.   

 All Men’s Sheds throughout Australia are eligible to apply for up to $10,000 in  Government assistance.  

 Round Three of funding will open in late August 2011 and interested Sheds should  monitor the Men’s Shed website http://www.mensshed.org for updates.
