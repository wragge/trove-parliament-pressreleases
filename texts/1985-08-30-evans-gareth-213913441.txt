 AUSTRALIA*S SUPPORT FOR NAMIBIAN INDEPENDENCE

 Opening Address to the CARE Canberra Conference on Namibia by  Senator the Hon Gareth Evans QC, Minister for Resources and Energy  and Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs# 

 Australian National University# Friday 30 Ausust 1985.

 It is a pleasure to be here this evening to open this Conference 

 on Namibia# and I congratulate CARE for organising it on behalf of 

 the Council on Namibia.

 In opening this Conference# I would like to outline for you 

 Australia's long-standing support for the cause of Namibian  independence, 

 factors that have assisted and retarded the achievement of that 

 objective.

 Namibia is one of the few countries which remain on the 

 decolonisation agenda of the United Nations after more than 

 seventy former colonies have achieved political independence in 

 the past quarter century.

 Namibia has been a constant preoccupation of the United Nations 

 since its formation# and indeed has been a direct responsibility 

 of the United Nations since 1966 when the South African mandate 

 was terminated. South Africa has, however # refused to allow 

 direct United Nations administration of the Territory and Namibia 

 remains under de facto rule by the Pretoria Government,

 South Africa's position has been almost from the outset, is now, 

 and will remain, internationally untenable. In 1975, South Africa 

 acknowledged that the territory of Namibia had a separate 

 international status and from 1977 it accepted that the ultimate 

 status of Namibia was as an independent state. However, since 

 then there have been continuous arguments focused on how best to 

 bring Namibia to independence and continuing delays in achieving 

 any movement. The blame lies squarely at the feet of the South 

 African Government, which has repeatedly found excuses to 

 prevaricate and retreat from its commitments.

 2

 This meeting takes place at an important time for the people of 

 Southern Africa. Events in Namibia and in Angola in recent times, 

 as well as in South Africa itself, cause Australia and the

 international community concern and dismay. Our support for the 

 United Nations' efforts to end the conflict and bring Namibia to 

 independence is and has been unequivocal. We share the 

 frustration of the international community over the continued 

 delay in Namibia's independence, a cause to which Australia has 

 been committed for many years, as I will later outline.

 But our dismay and frustration is nothing compared with the

 dismay of the people of Namibia whose rightful independence 

 continues to be denied them.

 This leads me to mention immediately the most welcome presence in 

 our midst of the Secretary-General of the South West African 

 People's Organisation, Mr Toivo ja Toivo, I had the honour to

 meet Mr Toivo earlier today in my office, and I am glad that a 

 person of his stature is participating in this conference. It is 

 a matter of regret that his arrival here was attended with some 

 unfortunate distractions, but I am glad that the matters involved 

 were able to be resolved swiftly and, I believe, mutually

 satisfactorily.

 Needless to say, Australia acknowledges SWAPO as a major 

 nationalist group in Namibia and one which has an essential role 

 to play in settlement negotiations. We took forward to the day 

 when the Namibian people will be able to choose a government of 

 their own volition.

 Since 1977 the Chief negotiator and intermediary between the 

 principal parties, South Africa and SWAPO, has been a "contact 

 Group" comprising the five Western members of the Security Council 

 in 1977 (France, Canada, FRG, Britain and the United States). In 

 1977 this group jointly advised South Africa that its attempts to 

 impose an Internal settlement were unacceptable to the West. The 

 Contact

 3

 Group has involved itself in discussion and negotiation on 

 constitutional and electoral procedures to precede a settlement, 

 the role of UNTAG and the implementation of procedures leading to 

 independence. Its role is recognised in Resolution 435 of 

 September 1978, which endorsed proposals for a ceasefire and a 

 political settlement supervised by 

 Group (UNTAG). The Australian Government supports the Contact 

 Group's efforts.

 It is a matter of great regret to Australia that the agreement 

 reached between the parties concerned, as far back as 1982, on all 

 outstanding issues relating to the implementation of UNSCR 435 - 

 the acceptance of a set of principles concerning the constituent 

 assembly and the constitution for an independent Namibia, 

 understandings on the questions of impartiality, size and 

 composition of UNTAG - should have failed to bring about Namibia’s 

 independence. The UN Secretary-General himself visited Southern 

 Africa in 1983 to resolve certain issues. All the necessary 

 understandings required for the UN pcaoo plan to be implemented 

 are in place. Only extraneous issues delay a final settlement - 

 and I refer here to the insistence by South Africa that Cuban 

 troops currently in Angola must be withdrawn before a settlement 

 can be reached on Namibia.

 The Australian Government continues to express its concern that a 

 Namibian settlement has been delayed for so long and that such 

 extraneous factors continue to frustrate a final settlement. 

 International concern over the linkage of Namibian independence to 

 the Cuban troops issue, and the consequent delays in the progress 

 towards the ultimate goal of an independent Namibia, is growing 

 especially among black African states.

 At the New Delhi Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 1983, 

 all Heads of Government endorsed an explicit criticism of 

 linkage. Security Council Resolution No 539, of October 1983, 

 adopted by 14 votes to none (the US abstaining) also contained a 

 core "anti-linkage" element. France has suspended its

 - 4-

 participation in the Contact Group on grounds that the Group no 

 longer has a useful function because of linkage. The initiative 

 wiLl«In the Givuy wOuld appear to largely with the United

 States. There is growing frustration on the part of African 

 states over the Impasse.

 The whole question of linkage arises from South Africa’s ability 

 to use to its advantage international perceptions of great power 

 rivalry in southern Africa. The MPLA Government was installed in 

 Angola in 1975 only after obtaining Soviet and Cuban assistance. 

 South Africa has been able successfully to argue that the 

 continued presence of Cuban troops in Angola is a destabilising

 influence in the whole southern African region and a direct threat

 to South African security. South Africa maintained a presence in 

 Southern Angola until 15 April this year when it claimed it had 

 completed a withdrawal of its remaining forces from Angola in

 accordance with the agreement reached with Angola in 1984, the 

 Lusaka Accords.

 The incursion by armed South African troops into Cabinda, Angola, 

 in June must call into question the South African Government’s 

 bona fides in proclaiming a final withdrawal from Angola in April, 

 and its readiness to achieve a peaceful resolution of the problems 

 of Southern Africa. Any further linkages to the settlement in 

 Angola, and talk of spurious "final withdrawals" would of course 

 only result in further delay. It is clear also that the

 revocation of the Clark Amendments by the United States Congress 

 in July this year, effectively now allowing the US to give 

 military assistance to South-African-backed UNITA forces in 

 Angola, have led to a slow-down in trilateral talks between the 

 United States, Angola and South Africa.

 Australia has supported Security Council Resolution 567 condemning 

 South Africa for its aggression in Angola at Cabinda. Our support 

 also for Security Council Resolution 566 in June this year 

 confirmed Australia’s commitment to Namibian independence and

 3

 affirmed our support for the imposition of economic and other 

 measures against South Africa. I might add here that the measures 

 introduced by the Australian Government against South Africa on  12 August, while focused on South Africa’s apartheid policies, 

 will hopefully add to pressure on the South African Government 

 with respect to Namibia.

 A parallel act of defiance by the South African Government against 

 the proper role of the United Nations in bringing about 

 independence for the Namibian people has been the installation, in 

 June this year, of a so-called interim government in Namibia, 

 comprising representatives of parties in the Territory

 representing only some Namibians.

 The South African Government's actions in setting up such a 

 government are not in accordance with United Nations Security 

 Council Resolution 435. The Australian Government continues to 

 support strongly the early independence of Namibia and to 

 emphasise that UN Security Council Resolution 435 remains the only 

 acceptable and agreed basis for an internationally recognised 

 settlement in Namibia. Any moves to bypass the UN settlement 

 plan, such as the establishment of an "interim government*, are 

 regarded by the Australian Government as utterly null and void. 

 We look forward to the day when Namibians will be able freely to 

 elect a Government of their own choosing, and will not accept any 

 claim uf the South Aft iueu Government that that day hao already   come.

 To review South Africa’s record, it is not one which inspires 

 confidence in its bona fides. On the one hand it has signalled 

 willingness to negotiate; on the other it has pursued policies of 

 regional destabilisation which have caused considerable suffering 

 and hardship to the population of the Front Line States. It moved 

 close to acceptance of the final arrangements for the putting into 

 place of the United Nations plan, only then to link Namibian 

 independence to the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola. It 

 gave the impression of flexibility in agreeing to participate in 

 the Lusaka negotiations in 1984 yet, once again, stymied progress 

 because of linkage. It· entered into an agreement with Angola fOt  

 the withdrawal of South African troops but then arrogated to 

 itself the right to despatch troops into neighbouring states.

 '  -Î­-

 The Australian Government's position is quite clear. It rejects 

 linkage as a precondition for the implementation of Regulation 

 435, deplores South Africa's recent raid into northern Angola, and 

 rejects the so-called interim government of Namibia.

 Australia's Role

 Although I have said a number ot things already about AusUalia'e

 response to particular developments, let me now bring the various

 threads together and explain in more detail the role which

 Australia has played over the years in helping to bring 

 independence to Namibia. That role has been, I believe, an

 overwhelming constructive one, and one consistent with our long 

 record of support for international efforts to gain independence 

 for colonial countries and peoples generally.

 But it should be acknowledged at the outset that there is one 

 major occasion in the past when Australia, through its

 representation on a major world body, was perceived to have placed 

 a major stumbling block in the way of the Namibian people. I am 

 thinking of the 1966 decision by the International Court of

 Justice, under the Presidency of the late Sir Percy Spender, of 

 the challenge made by Ethiopia and Liberia against South Africa in 

 respect of Namibia - in what has become famous, or notorious, in 

 international law as the South West Africa Case. Ethiopia and 

 Liberia charged that South Africa was in breach of Article 2 of 

 the Mandate Agreement which required South Africa to "promote to 

 the utmost the material and moral wellbeing and the sound progress 

 of the inhabitants of the territory". In the event, the vote of 

 the Court was split and Sir Percy Spender felt obliged to direct 

 his casting vote with South Africa - on the basis that Ethiopia 

 and Liberia could not be considered to have established that they 

 had any legal right or interest in the subject matter of the 

 claims. I must say that my own. personal view is that the decision 

 was not only a poor one as a matter of international law, but a 

 most unfortunate one for Namibia, and-even though the case did in 

 fact provide the impetus for the revocation of South Africa's 

 mandate - I wonder how the course of history might have changed 

 had the decision been made the other way.

 7

 Our more constructive role in relation to South West Africa began  With our founding memberahip of tho Special Cnmmi ttee of 24 (the 

 Special Committee on the situation with Regard to the 

 Implementation of the Declaration on the granting of independence 

 to Colonial Countries and Peoples) formed in November 1961.

 In 1972, with the coming to power of the Labor Government, 

 Australia became more active in the United Nations in supporting 

 measures aimed at eliminating racism and colonialism and granting 

 people in colonial territories the right of self-determination and 

 independence. .

 It was at that time that Australia also began a policy of 

 developing closer ties with black Africa and loosening some of its 

 links with South Africa, and this policy was continued by thd 

 Liberal and National Country Party Government when it came to 

 office in 1975. '

 In the United Nations, Australia supported all General Assembly 

 resolutions relating to Namibia between 1977 and 1978, and we 

 began modest contributions to UN programs for southern Africa in 

 1973. Also in that year we refused to recognise South African 

 representation of Namibia and in 1974 we recognised travel 

 documents issued by the UN Council for Namibia. in January 1973, 

 we rejoined the Special Committee of 24 (having withdrawn from the 

 Committee in 1969) and on 18 December 1974 we joined the UN 

 Council for Namibia. We are one of only four Western Members of 

 the Council, and I am pleased that the Council was able to support 

 this Conference in Canberra here this weekend,

 I have indicated already our strong and continuing support for 

 Resolution 435 of 1978 and all subsequent efforts to implement 

 it. I should add that, as part of that support for Resolution 

 435, we have also supported calls - on moral and pragmatic grounds 

 - for the integration of Walvis. Bay, a white South African 

 enclave, into an independent Namibia.

 Australia's support of a United Nations-based settlement is 

 underlined by our continuing willingness to participate in the UN 

 Transition Assistance Group which would supervise a ceasefire and 

 elections in Namibia. The previous Australian Government had 

 offered to supply forces for the military component of UNTAG. The 

 offer involved some 250 engineers and 50 headquarters staff. The 

 present Australian Government has agreed that this offer should 

 stand. Australian involvement in UNTAG would demonstrate the 

 Government's continuing commitment to an internationally-agreed 

 settlement for Namibia.

 Another important current element of our interest in Namibia is 

 the fact that Australia is a member of the Security Council this 

 year and in 1986. I have already mentioned some important 

 Security Council Resolutions in the last few months bearing on the 

 Namibian question which we have strongly supported.

 What we have not found ourselves able to endorse, in the United 

 Nations or elsewhere, is the concept of armed struggle as a means 

 of achieving independence for Namibia. while Australia 

 understands the frustration and aspirations which have resulted in 

 groups under oppression in certain countries resorting to violence 

 in order to bring about change - and while we can readily 

 understand that the intransigence of South Africa might lead the 

 Namibian people to conclude that as a last resort such means might 

 be necessary to achieve Namibian independence - successive 

 Australia governments have remained firmly committed to the 

 peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with the UN Charter«

 Australia's opposition to violence as a method of effecting 

 political change has meant that our assistance to the oppressed, 

 to the victims of apartheid, has been restricted to humanitarian 

 relief such as aid to refugees, and to training aid. Our emphasis 

 is on providing the training which.will be useful on independence 

 and on humanitarian assistance to the victims of oppression, 

 rather than aiding the national liberation movements as such, and 

 I will come back in a moment to how such assistance has been given 

 in relation to Namibia.

 9

 Me have also been willing to take steps to ensure that the voice, 

 and cause, of the Namibian people has been heard in this country. 

 In an effort to counter pro-apartheid propaganda, the Government 

 gave permission on 26 October 1983 to the ANC and SWAPO to open 

 information offices in Australia. I am pleased to note that Mr 

 Toivo will next week open formally SWAPO*s Information Office here 

 in Australia, in Melbourne. Bill Hayden's invitation to SWAPO to 

 establish an information office in Australia was expressly 

 welcomed in the 1984 Australian Labor Party Conference resolution 

 on Namibia. That resolution ot my party clearly articulates our 

 condemnation of South African policies and our support for 

 Namibian independence.

 The Government believes that the dissemination of information by 

 the representatives of the ANC and SWAPO organisations accords 

 with the operation of a free democratic society. These 

 information offices have been set up on the basis that they are 

 not granted a special privileged status, that their staff are not 

 given special standing and that their purpose is for the 

 dissemination of information only and not the advocating of 

 violence as a means of achieving political objectives. The 

 Government has received undertakings by SWAPO and ANC to abide by 

 the conditions governing the operation of their information 

 offices. '

 The question of government financial assistance to African 

 liberation movements has been addressed by the Government, and I 

 should say something frankly about this in the context of SWAPO 

 since it has been raised directly by Mr Toivo. It was 

 specifically made clear to both SWAPO and the ANC that in deciding 

 to establish information offices in Australia it was to be 

 understood that the Australian Government would not provide 

 financial assistance for the administration or other operations of 

 these offices. It is the Government’s view that foreign 

 representative organisations wishing to establish themselves in 

 Australia should do so from their own resources. Whatever 

 sympathy we can feel for the organisation in question, it would 

 not be appropriate for the Australian Government to commit public 

 funds to the maintenance of a foreign representative offices in 

 Australia. The Government has recently reaffirmed this policy.

 -/Î¿

 Australia has, however, been willing to assist Namibia financially 

 in other ways.

 We were one of the first countries to make a contribution to the 

 UN Fund for Namibia. This Fund has played an important role in 

 the preparation of the people of Namibia for independence. 

 Australia has also participated in the administration of the Fund, 

 providing the Rapporteur and Vice Chairman of the Committee in 

 1979/80. Our annual contributions to the Fund in 1984 and 1985 

 was $A70,000. We have also been substantial contributors to the UN 

 Education and Training Program , and Trust Fund, for Southern 

 Africa.

 Outside the UN organisation and agencies, Australia has provided 

 assistance through Commonwealth channels. Australia is a major 

 supporter of the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation 

 (CFTC), contributing $A6.065 million to this fund in 1984/85, 

 nearly half of whose work includes Southern Africa. In 1979 we 

 earmarked a contribution of $200,00 for the Commonwealth Special 

 Fund for Namibia, a program coming under the CFTC.

 Since 1978 Namibians have enrolled in tertiary courses In 

 Australia under a Special Commonwealth African Assistance Plan. 

 At present there are five Namibians studying in Australia, of 

 fifteen who have studied here in recent years. Namibians are 

 welcome to apply for scholarships under various schemes provided 

 they are suitably qualified and are endorsed by the Commonwealth 

 Secretariat in London. A Namibian also participated in the 

 Foreign Service Training Course in Australia in 1984.

 I should like to conclude tonight by applauding the fact that this 

 Conference is taking place at this critical juncture in the 

 history of Namibia, and that it should be held here where there is 

 quite clearly such concern for the future of the Namibian people. 

 On behalf of my colleague Bill Hayden, let me express the fervent 

 hope of the people of Australia for an increase in the tempo of 

 negotiations for the independence of Namibia. Let me also, 

 finally, urge the South African government to reconsider its 

 approach to the process, and to accept the work with the proper 

 role of the United Nations in bring it to a successful conclusion 

 in as short a time as humanly possible.
