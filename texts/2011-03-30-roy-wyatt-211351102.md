 E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It’s good to be here at Kangaroo Bus Lines. I want to thank Daryl and Jan for making Wyatt Roy and me so  welcome. It’s good to be here in the electorate of Longman. This is I think my first visit to Longman since  the election. I spent a bit of time here with Wyatt Roy as a candidate and it’s great to come back with Wyatt  as a local member. It’s good to see the bonds which he has already clearly developed with so many people in  his electorate. I think it’s also terrific that we do have this fine young Australian in the parliament. I think  it’s important that the parliament is as representative as is reasonably possible of the Australian community  and that’s why I’m very pleased to have Wyatt as such a strong and dynamic up and coming member of the  Liberal National Party team in Canberra.   

 Look, Wyatt will say a few words about local issues in a minute and I’ll ask Daryl to say a few words about  the impact of the carbon tax on businesses like his, but if I could just say a couple of things about the wider  political scene first. I think we’re in the presence of two deceptions today, two deceptions from the Gillard  Government, two deceptions that were foisted on the public by a panicking government in the days before  the last election. The first deception is the East Timor deception. The Prime Minister promised us an  offshore detention centre in East Timor as some kind of solution to the boat people crisis. She knew at the  time it would never happen. It was never intended to happen and now of course it’s obviously unravelling.   

 Then of course there is the daddy of all deceptions, the carbon tax fib. This is a Prime Minister who will be  haunted to her political grave by her statement six days before the last election “there will be no carbon tax  under the government I lead”. Plainly, thanks to the alliance with the Greens the carbon tax is coming. The  carbon tax is going to increase every single Australians’ cost of living. It’s going to damage tens if not  hundreds of thousands of Australians’ job prospects. By the time that it knocks on through the economy it  will damage every single Australian’s job security.   

 Now, here at a business like this where the buses, the 96 buses, are using something like a million litres of  fuel a year, just for starters that’ll be something like a $65,000 hit on the fuel bill of Kangaroo Bus Lines and  that’s $65,000 that’s going to be passed through to the price of your bus ticket. That’s an additional charge  on every pensioner who is trying to get around on the local bus and that’s why people like Wyatt Roy and I 

 2 

 

 are going to fight this carbon tax while there is breath in our political bodies. So Wyatt, do you want to say  something?   

 WYATT ROY:   

 First of all I want to thank Tony Abbott for coming here to the electorate today and recognising the concerns  of locals here. We have seen today a business that will struggle under another tax from the Labor Party. In  Caboolture we have twice the national average unemployment rate and we have a local economy that’s  dependent on small business, retail and tourism - something that needs confidence in government to have  confidence in the local marketplace. Another toxic tax from the Labor Party won’t instil confidence in local  businesses. So, not only will this new tax affect local families in my electorate and their budgets, it will  affect local small businesses and local employment opportunities.   

 So, I want to thank Tony for coming today and recognising the challenges that the locals are facing. I think it  is something that the Labor Party in Canberra has failed to realise, just how tough it is here on the ground  locally.   

 DARYL WEBSTER:   

 Thank you very much. I thank Tony and Wyatt for coming out today. We’re like any other business that,  you know, unfortunately we do have to pass our costs on and we don’t need any more taxes than anybody  else and it just makes it difficult. The diesel goes up, the power goes up, all the other things we buy from our  suppliers will go up which means that at the end of the day we have no option but to put our fares up and  that just makes it more expensive and it’s like a dog chasing its tail.    

 So, I certainly hope that Tony and Wyatt are successful in stopping this ridiculous tax that is going to tax  businesses and then give it back to people who can’t afford to pay it. So, it’s a bit like Robin Hood taking off  the so-called rich to give to the so-called poor and unfortunately we’re in a society where everything seems  to be given to people for nothing and there’s no incentive for them to work. Thank you.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Thanks Daryl, thank you. Ok, are there any questions?   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, what do you think of Professor Garnaut’s points today that electricity prices are going rise and  rise significantly with or without a carbon tax?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, there is no doubt that electricity prices have gone up recently. If you look at the statistics, power prices  are 44 per cent higher now than they were three years ago. That’s an even stronger argument for not making  a bad situation worse. I mean, why make a bad situation worse by whacking an unnecessary new tax on  power prices?   

 QUESTION:   

 Have you sorted out the issues with Andrew Robb regarding tax cuts for companies?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It’s very clear that the Coalition supports business tax cuts. We took a policy to the last election that would  have given business a 1.5 per cent tax cut. The difference between us and the Government is that we were 

 3 

 

 funding the tax cut through long term savings. They’re funding their tax cut with another tax. So, they’re  robbing Peter to pay Paul. We’re making government live within its means.   

 QUESTION:   

 Andrew Robb though yesterday came out saying that he didn’t agree with it.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 He said that we don’t agree with the mining tax and of course we don’t agree with the mining tax but we  support tax cuts for business, particularly for small business.    

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, will you be meeting Campbell Newman while you’re in town?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I certainly hope to catch up with Campbell. He’s a particularly busy man at the moment. Obviously  he’s finalising his term as an extremely successful Lord Mayor of Brisbane but I certainly look forward to  catching up with Campbell if he can spare me a bit of time.   

 QUESTION:   

 So, he hasn’t been able to find any time in his diary for you yet?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well at the moment we were looking at doing something together on Friday but that’s a particularly busy  day for him because that’s probably the last day of his Lord Mayoralty.   

 QUESTION:    

 Do you agree with this decision by the state LNP to choose someone from outside the parliamentary party?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, I think it’s important that we choose the best candidate and Campbell Newman is the best candidate to  take on a poor government lead by an often floundering Premier and win the election.    

 QUESTION:    

 So do you believe he could make a good premier?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Absolutely. He has been the best Lord Mayor of Brisbane that anyone can remember. That qualifies him to  be an extremely capable and competent premier of Queensland.    

 Now, look just if you’ve run out of local questions, I probably should just add that the Labor Party, not just  in New South Wales but right around Australia, is suffering the shockwaves of the New South Wales  election disaster. The former premier Kristina Keneally got it right when she said that the Labor Party had  walked away from the Australian people, and the Australian people in rejecting the New South Wales Labor  Government didn’t just say no to a particular government, they said no to a whole Labor style of governing

 and the trouble is that Sussex Street went to Canberra when Kevin Rudd was politically assassinated in a  coup masterminded by the former state secretary of the New South Wales Labor Party, now a Minister in the  Gillard Government, Senator Arbib. So the Sussex Street ghosts are haunting Canberra and they’ll stay  haunting Canberra until the end of the Gillard Government.    

 QUESTION:    

 We’ve heard the findings of the Bali summit. Are we barking up the wrong tree with regional processing?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I think it’s very important that we should have offshore processing of illegal boat people and there is one  country which is only too happy to host an offshore processing centre and that’s Nauru. The centre there was  built with Australian taxpayer dollars. The people and the Government of Nauru are only too happy to  reopen that centre and I say to the Prime Minister, if you are fair dinkum, pick up the phone to the President  of Nauru, he is eagerly awaiting your call. The Nauruan people want to help out their mates in Australia by  reopening a detention centre. Let’s do it.    

 QUESTION:    

 Does she have any other options? Is she out of options now?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, I don’t know why the Prime Minister is letting her pride and her ego stand in the way of doing the  right thing by the people of Australia, stopping the boats or helping to stop the boats, by reopening the  centre in Nauru. The centre in Nauru was an important part of policies that worked. Those policies worked  in the past. They can work again in the future. Pick up the phone to the President of Nauru, reopen the  detention centre there and help to stop the boats today.
