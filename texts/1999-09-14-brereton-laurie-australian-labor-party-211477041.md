  EAST TIMOR: FORCED REMOVAL 
OF EAST TIMORESE

  

  The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laurie 
Breteton, today drew attention to reports of a premeditated poli  cy by Indonesian authorities 
to remove thousands of East Timorese to camps in West Timor.

  

  “Today’s edition of   The Independent  newspaper reports that 
officials in West Timor were ordered to establish camps to accommodate 
tens of thousands of East Timorese ‘refugees’ well before the 30 
August ballot”, Mr Breteton said.

  

  “These preparations provide further evidence of Indonesian military’s 
plans to orchestrate wide-spread atrocities and force the relocation 
of a major portion of the population of East Timor.”

  

  “There is also clear evidence of a large-scale air and maritime 
effort by the TNI to transport East Timorese from their homeland.”

  

  “The fate of thousands of East Timorese held in these militia-controlled 
concentration camps is now a matter of the gravest concern.”

  

  “The Australian Government must demand that the United Nations High 
Commission for Refugees together with appropriate non-government humanitarian 
organisations be given immediate and unconditional access to the East 
Timorese removed to West Timor and allowed to organise their return 
under the protection of UN peacekeepers.”

  

  A copy of   The Independent  report is attached.

  EAST TIMOR CRISIS: JAKARTA ‘PLANNED MASS EXODUS 
OF REFUGEES’

  

  By Humphrey Hawksley, a BBC world affairs correspondent

  

  FRESH EVIDENCE is emerging of a premeditated policy by Indonesia to 
empty East Timor of much of its population.

  

  Officials in neighbouring West Timor say they were ordered to set 
up camps to handle tens of thousands of people - before the independence 
referendum took place. Since Saturday, more than 24,000 people have 
left East Timor and registered with the West Timorese government. Many 
more, who believe they are on militia hit-lists, have left or are in 
hiding.

  

  The refugee co-ordination centre in Kupang said it had been told to 
prepare for a massive influx on 26 August, four days before the ballot. 
An official said the government was not so much running a refugee crisis 
as handling a transmigration programme. The official said thousands 
who had left would never go back to East Timor and were being found 
homes and jobs elsewhere.

  

  In further evidence that the exodus is being run by the Indonesian 
government, officials said specific areas were being selected for evacuation 
and people were being advised to “pack up and get out”.

  

  The latest arrivals are mostly from the west of the territory. With 
them come the militia, who were given control of the camps and are making 
a show of force; armed militiamen are common in Kupang. Foreigners have 
no access to the camps and hundreds of refugees who back independence 
are trying to escape to Bali.
