 2011: YEAR OF THE PEOPLE SMUGGLER 

 Posted on Wednesday, 25 January, 2012 

 

 

 2011 has been the year of the people smuggler with the Gillard Labor Government giving  them free reign as they have systematically dismantled what was left of Australia’s  functioning border protection system, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border  Protection, Michael Keenan said today.  

 "After previously abolishing offshore processing, eliminating temporary protection visas and  failing to follow through on their pre-election commitment to turn the boats around, Labor  used 2011 to completely capitulate to people smugglers and start releasing asylum seekers  into the community.  

 "As a result people smugglers successfully sent over 69 boats and 4730 people in 2011 they  will be welcoming in 2012 as another profitable year under a Labor Government if the status  quo continues," Mr Keenan said.  

 "With 131 boats and 8102 people arriving under Prime Minister Gillard’s watch alone, the  people smugglers will be counting their profits and will feel emboldened to continue their  trade knowing that business will still be stable unless Labor adopts the Coalition’s proven  border protection policies," he said.  

 "The tsunami of boats will continue in 2012 and is destined not be any different lest Labor  change their failed border protection policy, adopt Nauru as an offshore processing site,  immediately re-instate temporary protection visas and turn the boats back around when it is  appropriate and safe to do so.  

 "Australians are fed up with Labor’s dismal record on border security and lack of willingness  to make the tough decisions - only a Coalition government will bring order back to our  borders," Mr Keenan said
