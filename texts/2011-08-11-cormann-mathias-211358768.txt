 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH SENATOR MATHIAS CORMANN,  SHADOW ASSISTANT TREASURER   PERTH

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Thanks everyone for coming. I want to thank Gareth and Gary and everyone here at Rheem Solahart for the  opportunity to tour the plant and to see what is one of the remaining Australian success stories when it  comes to major household appliances. Hot water is one of the very few, probably the only major household  appliance, which is still predominantly provided by an Australian manufacturer and long may that continue.  The problem is that the carbon tax is not going to help. It's actually going to harm businesses like this even  though moving from electric to solar hot water is a very significant way for a typical Australian household to  reduce its emissions.    

 The more we learn about this carbon tax, the worse it gets. Today we see in the newspapers some very  senior Australian business leaders saying that this is the worst possible time for Australia to introduce a  carbon tax. It's never a good time to introduce a bad tax, but this is the worst possible time with a very  fragile international economic situation, and even here in Australia, the uptick in unemployment is an  indicator that we can't take our economic strength for granted.    

 A couple of other points, if I may. Just on the Manus Island announcement, I think that the Australian people  have learnt that you just can't trust this government and we should believe it when we see it when it comes  to any offshore asylum seeker processing centres. Finally, the Treasurer's surplus which was rock solid for  weeks, this morning he announces that it's merely an objective and I think we will find that by the weekend  it’s gone from being rock solid, to an objective, to a dream. You just can't trust these people. Everything  they say they will do turns out to be a mirage. This is a government which has the Midas touch in reverse.    

 It's good to be here with Senator Mathias Cormann, the Shadow Assistant Treasurer and Senator for Western  Australia. I want to thank Mathias for helping to organise today's visit and I might ask him to say a few  words.  

 MATHIAS CORMANN:

 Thank you, Tony. It’s great to have our leader, Tony Abbott, here in Western Australia with us over the next  few days. We've been campaigning against the carbon tax because the carbon tax is bad for household  budgets, it is bad for our economy and of course it is doing no good for the environment. A carbon tax  which will push up the cost of everything, which will make Australia less competitive internationally, which  will make businesses like this one less competitive internationally and just shift emissions overseas rather  than to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions is not effective action on climate change, it is just a reckless  and irresponsible act of economic self harm. So, we’ve got a job to do and I look forward to working with  Tony over the next few days here across Western Australia campaigning against this very bad tax.  

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Ok, are there any questions? 

 QUESTION: 

 Mr Abbott, under direct action, the Opposition claims to put an extra one million solar energy roofs over a  nine or 10 year period. Basically wanting to know, your policy equates to 274 solar energy roofs or solar hot  water systems being installed every day for a decade. Given the technology involved, can that actually be  done?  

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Well, we think it can and what we’re proposing to do is to add $1,000 to whatever other assistance measures  there are for solar roofs. Now, we think it's important that we encourage the use of renewable energy. We  think that moving from electric to solar hot water is a very practical and constructive way for Australian  households to reduce their emissions. 

 QUESTION: 

 With that $1,000, though, who will oversee the system of sending that money out to the one million people  that you think will take part in this scheme?  

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Well, again, it will operate in the same way that government programmes operate. This is $1,000 on top of  existing incentive payments. So, the existing incentive payments will continue and there will be $1,000 on  top of that.  

 QUESTION: 

 Mr Abbott, does the Opposition have a costing figure for scrapping Julia Gillard's carbon tax and replacing  it with your direct action plan and, if so, what is it? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Well, our direct action plan will cost $3.2 billion over the forward estimates period and it's always  something that a Coalition government will want to do to have taxes as low as possible; and it is always  something that people want to see happen, namely to see tax reductions. Reducing taxes saves business  money. Imposing taxes or increasing taxes obviously costs businesses money. 

 QUESTION: 

 Do you oppose the Manus Island plan? Could you elaborate on your position there?

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Well, the interesting thing is that Manus Island was part of John Howard's Pacific Solution. It was by no  means the whole of John Howard's Pacific Solution. If you were going to properly implement the Coalition's  policy you wouldn't just have Manus Island, you would have Nauru, you would have temporary protection  visas and you would have, as an option up your sleeve, the option of turning boats around where that could  safely be done. So, I think it's all very well for the Government to take up one aspect of the Coalition's  policy but there is a lot more there that they should take up if they want to actually stop the boats.  

 QUESTION: 

 Do you support Chris Back’s comments that animal activists paid Indonesians to be cruel to animals? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 I think it's important that the Senate committee system is allowed to operate and the Senate committee  system works when senators bring to those committees their thoughts, their evidence, and then it's up to the  committee to make appropriate judgments and to give us an appropriate report.  

 QUESTION: 

 You’re not prepared to back him on this?  

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Well, look, he is a senator, he has material that he is going to present to the Senate committee and that's a  perfectly appropriate thing for him to do.  

 QUESTION: 

 Given these gloomy economic times are you still committed to budget cuts and returning the economy to  surplus?  

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Well I think it's very important that the Government honour its commitments and this is a government which  has been blowing its own trumpet up hill and down dale for months now, stating that a surplus in 2012-13 is  a fact, but the rock solid commitment to a surplus in 2012-13 has now become a mere objective, and as I  said, I am pretty confident that by the weekend it will have become just a dream, and that's typical of this  government. It almost never delivers on what it says it's going to do.  

 QUESTION: 

 [Inaudible] incentive system, Mr Abbott, will it be audited to make sure there’s no fly-by-nighters taking  advantage of the cash injections? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Well, as I said, it will be run as an addition to existing programmes, so it would use existing programmes.    The sort of safeguards that are built into existing programmes would simply carry over to our additional  $1,000 incentive. 

 QUESTION:

 Andrew Wilkie has called for John Howard and Alexander Downer to appear before an inquiry as to why  Australia went to war in Iraq. Do you think that’s necessary?  

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Look, you know, if we're talking about weapons of mass destruction, it was Kevin Rudd who as Shadow  Foreign Minister was more adamant than anyone that Saddam Hussein did have weapons of mass  destruction. So, if there is going to be an inquiry, let's make sure that it targets everyone. But, look, I think  that the war in Iraq is now eight years ago. I think that everyone has moved on and frankly I think there are  higher priorities for the Australian Government and the Australian people at this time. 

 QUESTION: 

 What do you make of unemployment figures released today? It’s risen to 5.1 per cent. 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Look, I accept that these statistics do bounce around but the fact that we now have official unemployment  over 5 per cent for the first time in many, many, many months shows that even the Australian economy is  not entirely insulated against events in the rest of the world. This is a very fragile international economic  situation. It is the very worst time to be adding to the burdens of Australian business, and that's why the best  thing the Government could do to restore confidence here in Australia will be to drop the carbon tax. This is  a toxic tax, and even people who have previously been in support of putting a price on carbon say that this is  the wrong way at the wrong time. So, drop the toxic tax, Prime Minister.  

 QUESTION: 

 Mr Abbott, why did choose to holiday in Europe rather than Australia? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Well, my daughter is a student at the University of NeuchÃ¢tel in Switzerland. She is studying there for 12  months as part of her degree at the University of Technology in Sydney. Many, many months ago my wife  and I decided that it would be good if we could visit her for a week or so and it seemed that the  parliamentary winter recess was the best time to do that. So, that’s why we went there, because that’s where  my daughter was. Normally, the Abbott family's holidays happen at a caravan park on the New South Wales  south coast.  

 QUESTION: 

 Mr Abbott, do you support an NDIS? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Look, I think it’s very important that Australia provide a better deal for people with disabilities. I'm not  wanting to deprecate for a second the hard work that is already done, but plainly we can and should do  better. So, I think it's very important that we take the Productivity Commission's report seriously, and I think  what people now want from the Government is a clear timetable for change and a clear and definite funding  envelope. I think all we've got from the Government is expressions of goodwill and statements of good  intent. Well, that's not good enough. We've seen many, many announcements from this government that are  basically announcements of goodwill and good intent that are never actually acted upon and I think everyone  in this country who wants a better deal for people with disabilities will be saying ‘fair enough Prime 

 5 

 

 Minister. You've said you welcome the report. Now let's see some firm action’ and we haven't seen that  from this government.    

 The final point I want to make on this point, sure, providing better services to people with disabilities will be  expensive. No doubt about that. The Government would be in a much better position to give people with  disabilities a better deal if they hadn't wasted so much money on ill-thought-through schemes like pink batts,  like overpriced school halls and now the National Broadband Network.
