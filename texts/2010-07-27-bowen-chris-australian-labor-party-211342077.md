 E & O E - PROOF ONLY 

 

 

 Subjects: Coalition Paid Parental leave costing error; cost of living pressures; 

 economic management; company tax; asylum seekers; Nauru. 

 

 CHRIS BOWEN: Well, this morning we see another policy error from the 

 Opposition, another costing blunder. Today we had the revelation that the 

 Opposition has had to change their paid parental leave scheme. 

 

 Today we have the announcement that under the Opposition’s scheme, 

 fathers who take paid parental leave will be paid at the pay rate of the 

 mother. This is a clear contradiction to the statements of the Shadow 

 Minister just a few months ago, that payments would be made based on the 

 salary rate of the parent taking the leave. This shows the Opposition is 

 engaging in policy on the run, costings that are wrong, policy that’s being 

 made up as they go. This goes to the heart of their fiscal and economic 

 credibility. This is not the first costings error of the Opposition in this 

 campaign. 

 

 Now, yesterday the Treasury and the Department of Finance released the 

 pre-election fiscal outlook. The Opposition have previously said that once 

 that outlook was released, they would submit their policies for costing by 

 the Department of Finance. Time is up for the Opposition and their excuses 

 have run out. They now must submit their policies to the Department of 

 Finance and the Treasury in accordance with the Charter of Budget Honesty 

 so that these policy areas and costings errors can be gone through by the 

 nation’s independent fiscal costers. 

 

 Of course, yesterday we also saw the revelation from the Leader of the 

 Opposition, his admission that his tax, his increase in the corporate tax rate 

 for 3,000 businesses across the country, would increase business costs and 

 increase therefore cost of living pressures on Australians. 

 

 Now, Mr Abbott, in the debate, made it clear he had no plans to deal with 

 cost of living. Now we know his only plan to deal with cost of living is a plan 

 to put the cost of living up. His tax on corporate Australia is a tax on the 

 cost of living of Australians. We have a plan to reduce the corporate tax rate; 

 theirs is a plan to put the corporate tax rate up. This shows his lack of 

 economic credibility and his lack of understanding of the important cost of 

 living pressures on Australians. 

 

 Happy to take some questions. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Mr Bowen, you’ve talked about all his mistakes. Why is the 

 Coalition killing you in economic management? 

 

 BOWEN: Well, I’m not sure I’d characterise it that way. That figure goes up 

 and down from time to time, and that figure jumps around quite a lot. From 

 our point of view, we will continue to point out that we did what we had to 

 do to get Australia through the global financial crisis. Mr Abbott, on the 

 other hand, wanted to follow the New Zealand path and send Australia into 

 recession, put more Australians on the unemployment line. 

 

 We kept Australia out of recession; doing what we had to do to get Australia 

 through the global financial crisis while keeping our AAA credit rating; and 

 returning the Budget to surplus in three years’ time, three years ahead of 

 time and before any other major advanced economy. That’s our economic 

 record. We’re more than happy to run on it. We’re more than happy to 

 compare our plans for the economy with Mr Abbott’s. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Why do you think voters think that the Coalition is still stronger 

 on managing interest rates and inflation? 

 

 BOWEN: Well, as I say, that figure jumps around. Historically, that has been 

 the case, that voters obviously say the Labor Party does a good job on 

 education and health, and the Liberal Party has traditionally in those polls 

 scored well on economic management. But that figure has jumped around 

 quite a lot over the last few years. From our point of view, the polls will go 

 up, the polls will go down. But we will stay focused on the economic task at 

 hand, and talking to the Australian people about our economic record and 

 our economic plans for the future. 

 

 JOURNALIST: But isn’t it embarrassing that Julia Gillard with Alan Jones this 

 morning couldn’t detail when the cuts would come to the company tax? 

 

 BOWEN: Look, I don’t think that’s right. I think the Prime Minister did outline 

 when the company tax rate starts, the reduction starts. She did make that 

 clear and that just underlines the point: we are reducing company tax; Mr 

 Abbott’s putting it up. 

 

 JOURNALIST: If she knew it, why did she stumble on it? 

 

 BOWEN: Well, she made it clear during the course of the interview when the 

 corporate tax rate cut was coming in, and I’m more than happy for the Prime 

 Minister to be questioned about our corporate tax cut, and I’m more than 

 happy for Mr Abbott to be questioned about his corporate tax rate increase. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Was she waiting for a piece of paper to be handed to her? 

 

 BOWEN: Well, the Prime Minister answered the question. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Has your Government been warned that we could expect an 

 influx of boat people [inaudible]? 

 

 BOWEN: Well, look, the Prime Minister’s made it clear that she thinks we 

 need a new approach. We need an approach which is a regional solution, 

 which stops the boats leaving the shores of other nations, doesn’t rely on 

 stopping the boats when they reach the shore of Australia. And that’s what 

 she has put on the agenda: a different approach to the Howard Government, 

 a new approach which deals with the problem at its source. Now, of course, 

 there are a complex range of circumstances which lead to different refugee 

 numbers across the world and we are focused on the task at hand, which is 

 that new approach, that regional approach. 

 

 JOURNALIST: [inaudible] 

 

 BOWEN: Well, look, a couple of things on that. The Opposition have 

 previously said that from opposition they couldn’t enter into any 

 negotiations with Nauru. Now there’s an election campaign, they’ve jetted 

 off to Nauru. I mean, this is a stunt. This is a massive stunt from a desperate 

 Opposition. Now, from our point of view, we’ve said we need a regional 

 approach but that the regional processing centre would need to be, for the 

 sake of decency, at a country which is a signatory to the Refugee 

 Convention. Nauru is not currently a signatory to the Refugee Convention. 

 That is why we’ve focused our discussions with East Timor and we’ll 

 continue to explore that regional approach. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Yet it continues to hurt you [inaudible]. 

 

 BOWEN: Well, this is a complex issue. We’ll continue to make our case that 

 we need a regional approach. Mr Abbott can continue to engage in his stunts 

 and his glib one liners on his policy, his policy which is destined to fail. We 

 have a more considered and balanced approach, and we’ll continue with that 

 approach. 

 

 Okay, thanks very much.
