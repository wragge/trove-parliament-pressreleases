 2004 FULBRIGHT SYMPOSIUM  ON 

 CIVIL-MILITARY COOPERATION AND THE WAR ON TERROR  BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA  5-7 JULY 2004  COUNTING THE COSTS OF WAR: THE CHANGED NGO ENVIRONMENT 

 by 

 MAJOR GENERAL MICHAEL G. SMITH AO (Retd)  Chief Executive Officer, AUSTCARE    

 Introduction  Let me add my thanks to the Fulbright Commission and the University of Queensland for this  excellent symposium.   

 A theme emerging from the conference so far is the extent to which the War on Terror has or  has not addressed the root causes of 9/11.  While significant action has been taken by Western  powers to contain and counter the terrorist threat in terms of homeland security, it is by no  means clear that regime changes in Afghanistan and Iraq have quelled Islamic  fundamentalism.  Indeed, a number of speakers have suggested just the opposite, and I must  confess to being sympathetic to this view.   

 Another theme to have emerged is the extent to which Australia has re-energised its focus to  stabilise the situation in a number of South Pacific countries.  I am generally pleased with our  successes to date, but I will be concerned if that commitment is not maintained for the long-term or if funds are diverted from the development budget to meet the necessary security  initiatives that are underway.  Clearly, both security and development must occur in tandem.   

 I third theme has been the concern expressed by a number of speakers as to the magnitude of  the terrorist threat that we are facing, and that this threat is real.  Even though the number of  terrorist incidents has decreased significantly since their zenith in the 1980s, the magnitude  and consequences of terrorist action has increased, as evidenced by 9/11, and more recently  by the bombings in Bali and Madrid, and the targeting of the UN Headquarters in Baghdad.   The question remains as to whether regime change in Afghanistan and Iraq has increased the  threat to Australia, and on that issue I am firmly on the side of Police Commissioner Mick  Keelty and believe that Australia is more threatened as a result of our involvement in Iraq.     

 Another theme raised has been that civil-military cooperation (CIMIC) is not new in  Australian history, as evidenced by our experience in World War 2.  However, the War on  Terror as well as complex peace operations in East Timor and the Solomon Islands, is forcing  us to reinvent and adapt civil-military procedures.  My own view is that the Australian  Defence Force (ADF) remains somewhat reluctant to “mainstream” and promote its CIMIC  capabilities, with effort limited at the tactical level.  Strategic oversight, policy and doctrine is  still lacking from Defence Headquarters where the importance of CIMIC, unfortunately,  remains a relatively low priority.     

 Scope     

 In this short presentation I will touch on two main issues:   

  2

 â¢ First, I will provide a brief overview of the effects that the War on Terror has had on  Non-Government Organisations (NGOs).   

 â¢ And second, I will explain why Australia should quickly establish a Regional Institute  for Complex Emergencies (RICE).    

 I have an important disclaimer to make: I am not speaking on behalf of all NGOs, but of my  own NGO - AUSTCARE (Australians Caring for Refugees).  They say that dealing with  NGOs is like trying to herd cats.  This is a truism, and it helps explain why NGO coordination  with military and civil authorities is often difficult.  So I do not stand before you today as the  lion of the NGO jungle, but rather as a representative of that group of development NGOs  concerned with human rights and the eradication of poverty.     

 AUSTCARE     Let me say a few words about AUSTCARE - an all-Australian NGO born in the shadows of  conflict in 1967 and which has been providing emergency relief and long-term support to  refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and returnees in more than 30 countries.    Right now we are doing 14 projects in nine countries, including in East Timor, South and  Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.  We work with local and international partners to  enhance human security at the grass roots level through practical peace building programs -  improving governance, helping strengthen civil society in local communities, enhancing food  security, improving education and training, removing landmines, initiating micro credit  schemes, and providing health support including against HIV/AIDS.  Right now we have new  projects we want to start in Sri Lanka and PNG, focusing on IDPs and refugees respectively,  but we don’t have the funds to commence these.   

 Refugees and IDPs now number around 45 million - more than double the population of  Australia - and almost all of these people are the innocent victims of conflict.  Sadly, these  people do not attract specific mention in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), yet  they represent the “poorest of the poor”.   Refugees and IDPs are not terrorists - they are  poor, homeless, hungry and bewildered people who just want to go home. But refugee and  IDP camps can provide the environment from which terrorists can be recruited and from  which people trafficking does occur.   There are three durable solutions to the displacement  problem - voluntary repatriation to home location when conditions are safe, local integration  when agreed by host governments and local communities, and resettlement to another  country.  This last option affects an important but relatively insignificant number of the total  displaced population - so it stands to reason that most effort should be directed to assisting  the bulk of refugees and IDPs in location.  The fact is, however, that until a political  settlement is achieved, most displaced people are forced to live in poverty, often for  generations.      

 Perhaps because of the detention and asylum seeker debate in Australia over recent years,  clear focus has not been given by our Government to “the poorest of the poor” overseas, and  the Australian public has become confused and distracted.  If NGOs like AUSTCARE, and  UN Agencies like UNHCR and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  (OCHA) were to receive more financial assistance - from Government and the public - then  more could be achieved to enhance human security amongst the world’s most vulnerable  people.  So in the run up to the elections please ask yourself what you can do about this  situation, and ask your local members what their political party will do if elected.  Quite  frankly, more money spent in refugee and IDP camps, and in assuring protection for 

  3

 returnees, will be far more effective than the War on Terror that is currently being waged in  Iraq.     

 

 After a long military career I am frequently asked why I have become an NGO “cross-dresser”.  The reality is that military folk understand better than most the causes and horrors  of conflict - as Clausewitz instructed, if you want peace then study war.  During their service,  many military personnel experience first hand the reality of poverty and the dignity of  suppressed or disadvantaged people - as I did during my service in PNG, Kashmir, Cambodia  and East Timor.  This helps explain why the first President of AUSTCARE for 20 years was  Major General Paul Cullen who, after earning a most distinguished war record, was in 1981  awarded the prestigious international Nansen Medal for work with refugees.  This human  nexus between conflict and peace - the two sides of the same coin - helps explain why a  Captain on leave from the Australian Army last year helped AUSTCARE extend our program  in Cambodia, and why I feel so privileged to be CEO of this NGO.  As a cross-dresser, it also  makes for some interesting intercourse when CIMIC and humanitarian assistance are under  discussion.         

 NGOs and the War on Terror   Now, while you are contemplating making a donation to AUSTCARE, let me turn to the  question of the impact of the War on Terror on NGOs.  In many respects, and in most  locations, I do not believe the work of humanitarian NGOs has changed markedly since 9/11.   There are exceptions of course, but in the main the focus has remained on poverty reduction  and capacity-building, with continuing attention being given to improving NGO effectiveness  and strengthening the various codes of conduct.  The guiding principles of the humanitarian  charter have not changed for development NGOs - independence, impartiality, neutrality, and  humanity based on adherence to human rights.  9/11 may have turned the world on its head,  but it hasn’t stopped the work of development NGOs.    

 What has changed, however, is the decision by many governments - Australia included - to  tie more humanitarian aid and development funding directly to the War on Terror, and to  insist that NGOs do not openly or inadvertently provide support to terrorists.  There are  compelling and understandable reasons for governments to have taken such action,  particularly in the aftermath of 9/11, and the Bali and Madrid bombings. But there have also  been some downsides.  Within governments there has been a mind shift from poverty  reduction to the War on Terror, and this has politicised aid and in some instances (such as  Iraq) perhaps even provided oxygen to terrorists (merely by recognising them).  Whereas  discussions with Government on aid issues a few years ago would have concentrated on  poverty reduction and capacity-building, increasingly they now focus more on security,  governance and the rule of law.   This is not necessarily a “bad thing”, but if resources are  diverted from longer-term development projects to fund short-term security and humanitarian  projects because of the War on Terror, then little strategic progress in the campaign against  poverty will be achieved.  This, I think, has been the result in Afghanistan, where emphasis  has been on regime change rather than rebuilding a viable civil society.  I am advised that a  significant amount of the US budget directed towards Afghanistan and Pakistan has been  diverted from the US aid program.  In Australia’s case, significant funding for the Pacific  Solution has come from the aid program.    

 Security is important to development NGOs because we cannot conduct our work effectively  if we, and the people we are working with, are living in fear.   NGOs want their humanitarian  space, but they don’t want to be perceived as part of peacekeeping and occupying forces, 

  4

 precisely because this jeopardises our neutrality and freedom of action.  Occupying forces  have a habit of leaving, but NGOs are there for the long haul and need to have the trust and  confidence of local communities.  This does not mean that NGOs do not agree with  intervention, but rather that such intervention must be justified for humanitarian reasons and  to improve the human security of the local population.  Where the legitimacy of intervention  is questioned, as in Iraq, NGOs and International Organisations - including the United  Nations - are more likely to be targeted by terrorists or insurgents because they are sometimes  seen by elements of the local population as being part of the occupying force.  Thankfully,  this was not the case in East Timor and the Solomon Islands where NGOs have been well  accepted, although PNG might yet prove to be a different story.     

 This diagram illustrates the dilemma facing failing and emerging states.  In order to ensure  peace, to foster democracy and have a viable market economy, all three legs of the stool -  development, security and governance - must exist or the stool will collapse.  Civil society in  such nations is fragile.  Human rights must be assured, including justice and equity.  And 

 sufficient financial resources must be available to implement viable programs.     

 

 

 

 FAILING AND  EMERGING STATES

 

 

 

 

 NGOs play a vital role in all of these areas - particularly at the grass roots level where civil  society must be strongest.  For governance and the rule of law to mean anything it must be  relevant and visible to the people.  Funding from the Australian government for development  is very low at around 0.25% of GDP, and a far cry from the 0.7% agreed as the international  benchmark required to achieve the MDGs.  A curious trend has emerged in funding for  overseas development in recent years: while the Australian community has been increasing its  support to NGOs on average by about 11.5% per annum, Government funding to NGOs has  declined.  In fact, Australian NGOs receive just over 5% of the aid budget.

 So has the War on Terror in Afghanistan and Iraq - as opposed to other more legitimate  “counter-terrorism” policies and actions for homeland security - made us and the populations  of those countries more safe?  Rather than focusing on helping people to escape the horrors of  poverty the War on Terror has diverted scarce resources to protect nations in the developed  world from undesirable elements in the developing world. Or, more precisely, it has helped  fuel the quest of Islamic fundamentalists.  President Bush may not agree with this assessment,  but I think this is the perception of many moderate Moslems, including those living in refugee  and IDP camps.  What is the point of overthrowing a Taliban regime sympathetic to Al Quida  in Kabul if you are unable to provide security for the Afghan people and you  empower war  lords to grow opium poppy?  What is the point of changing a corrupt regime in Baghdad if by  doing so you fracture the NATO alliance, degrade the United Nations, and enable terrorism to  become established in Iraq?   

 So I think there is a strong case for arguing that the War on Terror has diverted our attention  from the main game, which should be the halving of poverty by 2015 as stated in the MDGs.   This is a campaign we cannot afford to lose yet we are falling behind: half of the world’s six  billion people currently live on less than US$2 per day, and if we are to believe the World  Bank’s statistics then all except 50 million of the estimated 2,000 million to be born in the  next 25 years will be born in poor countries.  If the gap continues to increase between the  “haves” and the “have nots” then in all likelihood the War on Terror has already been lost.     

 A Regional Institute for Complex Emergencies (RICE)   I will conclude this short presentation with my second point, and say a few words about why  Australia needs quickly to establish a RICE.     

 The UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee has defined a complex emergency as “a  humanitarian crisis in a country, region or society where there is a total or considerable  breakdown of authority resulting from internal or external conflict and which requires an  international response that goes beyond the mandate or capacity of any single and/or ongoing  UN country programme”.1   

 As evidenced since the end of the Cold War, including in Australia’s immediate region,  complex emergencies are real and they are likely to be repeated in the future.  Australia’s  involvement in East Timor and the Solomon Islands in recent years, despite their success, has  revealed deficiencies in the preparation, coordination and training of deployed elements.   While the ADF and Australian Federal Police (AFP) normally undertake their own training  before deployment, civil administrators and NGOs do not always have this luxury (although  the NGO community is making advances in this area).  The roles of Emergency Management  Australia (EMA) and of AusAID have not always been clear.  In all cases, however, there has  been a lack of coordination and in some cases an inadequate understanding of international  best practice.  The military has tended to train in isolation at the tactical level, but without  clear strategic policy and doctrine.  And only since East Timor has the ADF begun to give  more emphasis to CIMIC, although most senior commanders still do not see this as essential  to their preparation.  The use of military forces in the delivery of humanitarian assistance and  the relationship of military forces to UN agencies and NGOs has not always been clear.

 The establishment of a RICE as a “centre of excellence” for high level coordinated research  and training is now required.  Australia has an opportunity to establish an Institute to conduct  relevant training with regional countries, based on UN best-practice guidelines.  Training  courses would cover such issues as CIMIC, international humanitarian and human rights law,  gender affairs, conflict mediation, rules of engagement, cultural awareness, transitional  justice, strengthening civil society, community policing, administration and financial  management, etc.   Many of the excellent training programs available through UN Agencies,  and centres such as the Centre of Excellence for Disaster Management and Humanitarian  Assistance in Hawaii, could be facilitated by the Institute.  Already in Australia we are  conducting courses relevant to complex emergencies, but coordination remains weak.  Such  examples include the CIMIC course conducted by the Asia-Pacific Centre for Military Law,  the peace operations seminar conducted by the ADF Peacekeeping Centre, disaster  management courses conducted by EMA, NGO training conducted by ACFID and RedR, and  AFP training.  There is a pressing need for Australians from these organisations to come  together at a senior level.  And there is a pressing need for Australia to build stronger linkages 

 within its own region, a process in which this Institute could assist.     

 The Institute would require seed funding from the Australian Government, in the same  manner as the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre was established in Canada.  However, it is  important that the Institute be independent and under civilian authority.   Resources from the  ADF and other Government Departments and Agencies, as well as support from the NGO  community, and corporate sponsorship would be required.     

 But wait, there’s more!  An excellent Masters paper on the RICE was written last year by  Lieutenant David Eastman and it is available through the University of Queensland (see Dr  Alex Bellamy at the School of Political Science and International Studies).  The paper needs  refinement, but it provides a good launching pad for the RICE.     

 Conclusion  Let me conclude by summarising a few key points.   â¢ First, there is a “disconnect” between the War on Terror and the reduction of poverty  through the MDGs, and scarce resources are being diverted from the latter to help fund 

 the former. This practice is not productive and is probably adding fuel to the cause of  terrorists.  â¢ Second, we should cease using the War on Terror as a mantra and strengthen our  campaign against poverty. Legitimate counter-terrorist measures must be taken to 

 enhance homeland security, but these should not be extended to justify a crusade  against the “axis of evil” or other States.  â¢ Third, we need to develop a more holistic approach to link security, development and  governance, and we must be careful that funding for security is not to the detriment of 

 humanitarian and development assistance.  â¢ Fourth, we should assist in strengthening the rule of law in failing and emerging states,  but this should be done in the context of furthering human security and cannot be 

 limited to military and police forces.     â¢ Fifth, development NGOs make a cost-effective contribution to building stable civil  societies and they should be supported financially by the Australian Government, in  equal measure to the Australian population.    â¢ Sixth, Australia needs quickly to establish a RICE to better prepare and coordinate a 

 whole-of-nation approach to complex emergencies, and to help strengthen regional  relationships.  

  7

 â¢ Seventh, a subliminal message from this symposium is that Australia must continue to  support the United Nations and be a leading player in pressing for its reform.   â¢ Eighth, CIMIC needs to be given higher priority within the ADF, and this will require  strategic priority and oversight.  (I encourage the Australian Strategic Policy Institute 

 to advocate for this to happen.)  â¢ And lastly, you should all make your tax-deductible donation to AUSTCARE today.   

 Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your questions.
