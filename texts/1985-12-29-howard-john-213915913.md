 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  News Release by John Howard, MP

 REFUGEES AND DRUGS TASK FORCE L100/85

 I am pleased to announce the departure on   14 January 1986 of the Coalition Task Force on   Refugees and Drugs.

 The Task force will combine an examination of the   dual problems of refugees and the distribution of   drugs from South East Asia.

 The Task Force which comprises Mr Alan Cadman MP,   the Shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,   Mr Tim Fischer MP, the Shadow Minister for Veterans'   Affairs, and Mr John Sharp MP, the ("Member for Gilmore,   will visit Thailand, Laos and Singapore.

 The Task Force will be led by Mr Cadman.

 The Opposition is concerned about both the fate of   the immediate families of Australian residents and   the inordinate delays faced by relatives in Cambodia   and Vietnam.

 Information collected during the Task Force's visit   to these countries will be used by the Opposition,   during its policy review process, to formulate a more   dynamic, hard-hitting,  anti-drugs policy to be  

 implemented in Government.

 Sydney  29 December 1985
