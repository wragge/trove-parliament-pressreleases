 AUSTRALIAN GREENS   MEDIA RELEASE   

 Monday, 25 February 2013   

 Children’s Commissioner a win for our kids   

 After paving the way for the creation of the position, the Australian Greens have today  welcomed the appointment of Megan Mitchell as the National Children’s Commissioner.   

 “Children are some of the most vulnerable people in our society,” the Greens’ youth and early  childhood spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “It is only right that we created the essential role of National Children’s Commissioner.   

 “Until now there hadn’t been a person whose sole focus was on the needs of our young people,  at a national level.   

 “Ms Mitchell has vowed to listen to our nation’s youngest citizens to make sure that their voices  are heard and I commend her for that.   

 “This is a major step in improving the situation for our young people and I look forward to  seeing Ms Mitchell assume the role and stand up for Australia’s children.   

 “I welcome this news, but now the government needs to act to protect children who come to  Australia fleeing war and persecution.   

 “The government must move to establish an independent guardian for unaccompanied refugee  children.   

 “Currently the Immigration Minister’s role as their legal guardian is a conflict of interest and he  has abandoned the very children he is supposed to protect.”
