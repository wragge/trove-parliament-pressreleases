         Introduction  

  After its decisive electoral victory in March 1996,  the Howard-led coalition  government set about a partial realignment of Austr alia’s foreign policy. The initial  international policy posture of the Howard governme nt was defined in two White  Papers issued by the coalition government in 1997 a s national policy statements.  The  coalition’s foreign and trade policy White Paper wa s In the National  Interest  and the  related coalition defence policy White Paper was Australia’s Strategic Policy . 

  The better aspects of the foreign policy of the How ard Government have  embodied the reasonable pragmatic statecraft In the National Interest defined. Less  often apparent in 1996-2002, since Howard’s 2002 preemption debacle this pragmatic  style has been more frequently evident. 

  In 2005, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, during an Asia-Link speech, stated  that there had been more progress in Australian-Asi an relations in the last three years  than ever before. He commented that this was not a ‘party political’ statement because  no Australian Government could claim credit for the  key changes in the Asian region  that have provided the opportunity for this progres s to occur (Downer 2005c). In  particular, Australia’s recent re-engagement with a  complex and historically volatile  Asian region had been influenced by the emerging possibilities of growing economic  integration and security cooperation (including cou nter-terrorism) that were changing  the strategic architecture of Asia.  

  Yet even when Australia was experiencing unparalleled opportunities for  cooperation with Asia, the personal prejudices of t he Prime Minister posed  unnecessary constraints on the realization of these  possibilities.  In several important  instances, diplomatic progress for Australia has oc curred despite, not because of, the  Prime Minister, who created unnecessary difficultie s for Australian diplomacy. 

  

  Howard’s White Papers 

  

  Incumbent governments, whether Labor or coalition, claim to be acting to secure  and safeguard Australia’s ‘national interests’, and  behave as if their (at least partially)  politically contentious constructions of Australia’ s ‘national interests’ are self-evident  truths. Nevertheless, as usual, the substantive cha nges in 1996 were less than the new  government’s rhetoric implied. There were strong co ntinuities on the central  fundamentals of foreign strategic and economic poli cy.  

  Set the task of adapting to a post-Cold war environ ment, the crafting of foreign  and defence policy focused on the priority of the U S alliance in Australian security  policy considerations. While Howard pledged to ‘rei nvigorate’ the ANZUS  relationship, Labor and coalition strategic thinkin g had maintained similar concepts of  Australian strategic interests (DoD 1997: 6, 29; DF AT 1997: 1-3). Both major parties  did not consider Australia to be under immediate mi litary threat, saw Australia’s  wider global interests being secured by the US alli ance as well as international  institutions and participation in peacekeeping and coalition forces while perceiving  Australia’s diplomacy and defence force and intelli gence as deterring threats from  emerging (DoD 1997: 37-42). The first Howard government’s trumpeted  renegotiation of the US-Australia relationship was notable, but no more significant 

   2 

  than the adjustments initiated under the Hawke gove rnment in 1985 to develop a  bilateral relationship when New Zealand excluded it self from ANZUS over the issue  of opposing visits by US nuclear armed or powered s hips. The then coalition 

  opposition had distinguished itself with an absurd call for Australian economic  sanctions to coerce New Zealand to resume its ANZUS obligations.  Other central continuities in foreign policy from L abor to the coalition included  the recognition that Australia’s security and econo mic interests were integrally  interconnected with the Asian region.  The first Ho ward government affected a new  ‘balance’ in relations between Asia and Australia’s  traditional economic and security  partners in Europe and the United States.  The Howa rd rhetoric was (and continues to  be) to allege that under Labor Australia was defini ng its place in the world too  narrowly with an allegedly excessively pro-Asian fo cus.  The new Howard ‘balance’  was based on the premise, oft asserted, that Austra lians did not face a choice between  our history and our geography (Sheridan 1996; Howard, 2005a).  However, this  proposition is rather specious because Labor never sought to sacrifice Australia’s  ‘history’ (Australia’s traditional economic and sec urity partners in Europe and the  United States) to Australia’s ‘geography’ (relation s with Asia), but like Howard to  pursue Australia’s (differently construed) national  interests in relation to both.   

  It was, after all, Labor Prime Minister Keating who  made a non-specific reference  to ‘recalcitrants’ who had not attended an APEC meeting in the United States. Former  Malaysian Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohammad recognized that he was among  those (implicitly) criticized, and took elaborate u mbrage in response. Knowing that Dr  Mahathir had advocated an East Asian Economic Community without the US in 1991  as an alternative to APEC and had been frustrated b y the US, Keating was hardly  according Asia priority over the United States. Kea ting’s unhelpful comment was  expensive for Australia because Dr Mahathir’s umbrage adversely affected Australian  regional diplomacy while he remained Malaysia’s Prime Minister.  

  The coalition’s 1997 White Paper In the National Interest was guided by an expert  advisory group (listed in an appendix to the White Paper) and influenced by  Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade professionals. Considered in retrospect, In  the National Interest was a generally sensible pragmatic analysis, embody ing an  inclusive agenda and repertoire of statecraft, not limited to academic realist  paradigms, despite the resoundingly realist tone of  national interest rhetoric.  

  In the National Interest  again outlined a number of Australia’s national in terests in  terms similar to earlier Labor policy statements, p articularly in relation to security, the  US alliance and trade liberalization. The most subs tantial foreign policy changes in  style and outlook under the first Howard government were a somewhat partisan pitch  on issues that reflected domestic political content ions between Labor and the coalition  about the priority of disarmament, the environment and human rights in Australia’s  ‘national interests’, and importance accorded to th e United Nations and multilateral  diplomacy. For instance, human rights were ‘insepar able’ from the coalition’s  approach but subject to ‘realistic’ expectations (D FAT 1997: 13-14). The outgoing  ALP Foreign Minister, Gareth Evans, had mobilized the United Nations to improve  the situation in Cambodia and had maintained a high  profile multilateral diplomacy,  especially on disarmament, the environment and human rights (Evans & Grant 1995).  The coalition did not discount the role of the Unit ed Nations and of multilateral  diplomacy, but both were accorded lower priority in  the incoming government’s  foreign policy rhetoric and practice, with bilatera l relations being regarded as the  ‘basic building block’ of coalition diplomacy. A sc heme of ‘practical bilateralism’  was repeatedly emphasised. 

   In the National Interest highlighted recurrent themes such as globalization,  new  regional centres of ‘power and influence’ and the r ise of East Asia as major trends  over the following 15 years, although the latter re ceived widespread media criticism  when the 1997-1998 financial crisis seemed to make that temporarily less obvious.  In  retrospect, however, it was the media critics who w ere mired in short-term 

   3 

  perspectives. While acknowledging ‘economic uncertainties’ and challenges for  Australia’s ‘economic and strategic weight in the r egion’, the White Paper  characterises the rise of East Asia as an ‘overwhel mingly positive influence’.  The  White Paper drew attention to the international sta nding of Australia in the global  economy, APEC and East Asia, and asserted that Australia’s future required a ‘whole  of nation approach’ linking domestic policies and i nternational relations. While APEC  is regarded as Australia’s priority involvement, th e White Paper strongly supported a  free trade agreement with ASEAN, and Australian participation in the ASEM Asia- Europe Summit, the then sole surviving remnant of Dr Mahathir’s vision of an East  Asian Economic Community (from which he persistently blocked Australia). In the  National Interest  also  advocated Australian issue-based coalitions beyond Australia’s  ‘traditional partners’, without acknowledging Labor ’s successful use of this technique  in areas such as the Cairns Group of advocates of f ree trade in agricultural products.  

  Despite the reasonable statecraft In the National Interest  embodied , the practice of  the Howard government’s foreign policy did, at time s, fall well short of the principles  expounded there . Howard’s 1997 defence White Paper Australia’s Strategic Policy   argued that ‘as the economies of East Asia grow....  that will affect our strategic weight  in our region, and ultimately our capacity to defen d ourselves’ (DoD 1997: 5).  Acknowledging that strategic policy must address ‘t he possibility that things may go  wrong’ (DFAT 1997: 4), it is not sensible to think in terms of Australia facing ‘a  historic challenge in maintaining Australia’s relat ive strategic standing’ formulated in  terms of a gearing to economic capacity.  Ultimatel y, Australia’s relative share of the  economy of the region will inevitably decline. That  does not mean that Australia’s  capacity to defend herself is therefore necessarily  imperiled, unless one accepts the  soft racist assumption in Australia’s Strategic Policy  that ‘Asia’ is strategically  undifferentiated and homogenized.  

  The premise that Australia’s capacity to defend our selves is jeopardised as the  economies of Asia prosper ignored the obvious consi derations that divergences of  strategic interests among Asian countries, and para llel interests with Australia, and  US alliances and arrangements with Australia and ot her countries in the region are  relevant to the strategic implications of Asian pro sperity. Australia’s security is  evidently enhanced by improving economic and military capabilities in Asian  countries with strategic interests that parallel Au stralia’s, such as Singapore, Thailand,  the Philippines, Japan and South Korea.  

  Reflecting the limited priority accorded to terrori sm before the mass casualty  events that have occurred in the twenty-first centu ry, in 1997 both In the National  Interest  and Australia’s Strategic Policy  gave terrorism remarkably slight attention  (DoD 1997: 31, 35).  In 1997 the Howard government was ill-prepared for terrorist  challenges. Well within the security White Paper’s policy timeframe the problems  associated with extremist terrorist groups such as Jemaah Islamiah have emerged as a  recognized ‘second front’ in the ‘global war on ter ror’, and a major imperative to  Australian counter-terrorist security cooperation w ith other countries, especially in  Australia’s Strategic Policy’s  area of strategic interest. 

  

         Incremental disengagement 1996-2002    

   From 1996 to 2002 Australia’s engagement with Asia generally tended to  diminish, as the Howard government conveyed a degree of uncertainty and caution  regarding long-standing policy consensus outlining the ‘push’ towards Asia and  responded to a series of global events and external  imperatives with a disposition to  correct Labor’s perceived over-enthusiasm for regio nal enmeshment. Domestic  political considerations also seemed to weigh heavi ly in the Howard government’s  foreign policy stance. Howard consistently downplay ed notions of changing policy  orientation to Asian engagement and remaking Australian identity. 

   4 

  In 1996-1998, the insular politics of One Nation, a nd to a lesser extent the Howard  government’s initially ambivalent relationship with  ‘Hansonism’, had attracted quite  exceptionally extensive and relatively persistent n egative interest in Asian media.  Howard’s exploitation of Pauline Hanson’s populist,  racist movement and his ill- timed appeals to free speech, damaged Australia’s i nternational reputation while  contributing to the manifestation of a domestic moo d that dehumanized immigration  and refugee policy (Jupp 2005). Howard’s equivocal approach to Hansonism unveiled  a parochial, opportunistic mindset that squeezed th rough to other policy areas.  

  The quality of the coalition government’s regional diplomacy and its denunciation  of the distinctive Hawke-Keating orientation were p ut to the test during the  unexpected Asian financial crisis in mid-1997. Asia ’s temporarily falling fortunes  served to dent predictions of the region as a realm  of economic dynamism of global  significance. Howard used the regional meltdown to extend a more assertive, self- assured posture that aimed to carve out an official  imagery of hardheaded, goal-based  engagement. For Howard, the regional meltdown highlighted the value of global  balance as well as Australian exceptionalism and le adership (Wesley 2001). The  Asian miracle was dubbed a mirage. Howard led the charge in stressing that  Australia’s underlying strength flowed from a natio nal ideology that emphasized  democratic, market-based capitalism and the rights of the individual. Australia’s  relative immunity to the setback was used to confro nt the political formulation of  ‘belonging’ and came to have a cogent impact on the government’s preferred sense of  history, Anglo-Celtic cultural tradition and self-p erception; a consequence that  advanced Howard’s commitment to consolidate the centrality of the US alliance.  

  The Howard government responded generously to the international adjustment  programs, initiated to respond to the financial cri sis. Coalition spokesmen proudly  noted that Australia and Japan were the only two co untries to contribute to all 3 IMF  packages for Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand. Australia’s trade and currency  buoyancy in the face of bearish East Asian economic  pressures highlighted the  apparent wisdom of the coalition’s preference for ‘ balance’. Crucially, however,  observers pointed to an accompanying self-congratul atory drumbeat and a finger- pointing exercise at the root causes of the crisis - ascribed to so-called Asian business  practices â that clouded the potential to strengthe n communication channels and  challenge postures predisposed to the immutable ‘lo gic’ of the market. As Anthony  Milner astutely observed: 

  despite its obvious domestic advantages, the determ ination to appeal to Australian  values and aspirations entailed an element of trium phalism that could only  damage Australia in the long-term. Ministers were c atering to the needs of what  Howard called ‘the Australian psyche’ when they began to speak of Australia as 

  the ‘strong man of Asia’ (2000: 40-41).   The currency crisis also tested expectations regard ing complicated Australia-East  Timor-Indonesia strategic ties. In May 1998, Presid ent Suharto and a divided  parliament handed over power to Vice-President B. J . Habibie. Under the pressure of  events, Habibie agreed to conduct a referendum to r esolve the political status of the  disputed province of East Timor, a former Portugues e colony that had been annexed  by Indonesia in 1975. Despite Howard’s initial comf ort in anchoring diplomacy in a  framework of appeasement - a policy that ignored di sturbing accounts of ongoing  human right abuses in Timor - he later rationalised  his government’s strategic  improvisation and fundamental reversal in security agreements as overturning twenty- five years of policy failure that had been built ar ound ‘special relationships’. ‘One of  the things…to avoid in diplomacy is to exaggerate t he character of relationships.  This…country has had far too many special relations hips and it’s a phrase that’s  dropped far too readily from the lips of far too ma ny Prime Ministers’ (Howard  1999).  When on August 30, 1999, 78.5% of East Timor’s voters chose to separate from  Indonesia, pro-Indonesia militias reacted by launch ing a campaign of widespread 

   5 

  terror, arson and violence. By mid September, the b loody situation, unfolding on  television, had become untenable. Given Habibie’s i nability to control the TNI and  criminal militias, mounting international outcry (p articularly US threats of economic  sanctions) forced Indonesia to accept proposals all owing the UN Security Council to 

  authorize the International Force East Timor (INTERFET). The peace-enforcement  operation sparked deliberation not only about impro vised security arrangements but  intensified debate about Howard’s ideological base for foreign policy. The  government’s nationalist interpretation for INTERFET participation argued that the  use of force for humanitarian purposes had been to ‘defend the values we hold as  Australians’ (cited in Inbaraj 1999). 

  At one level, Australia’s contribution to INTERFET and East Timor in 1999-2002  arguably should be acknowledged as a solid commitment to Asia, since it was saving  defenceless Asian victims from atrocities, but in l ocations such as Indonesia and  Malaysia Australia’s role received sustained negati ve publicity until the United  Nations officially took charge. Further, critics co untered by arguing that the initial  violence in Timor was both predictable and preventa ble. The Prime Minister was  accused of being an accidental liberator (Fernandes  2005). As relations with Asian  counterparts deteriorated, Indonesia responded by c anceling the bilateral security  agreement with Australia that had been negotiated b y the Keating and Suharto  governments in 1995. It is also worth noting that A ustralia’s expanded activities in the  region raised other thorny political issues - as wa s evident in its bullying attitude  towards East Timor in oil and gas negotiations over  the Timor Sea. 

  The government’s eagerness to counter ‘Asian’ with distinctive Australian values  was exposed when it invented two forms of regional engagement. While visiting  Beijing in 2000, Downer formulated an unhelpful distinction between ‘emotional and  cultural’ and ‘practical’ regionalism (Downer 2000) . The study of Asian cultures in  schools and Asian language courses also stalled und er Howard. Further, Howard’s  notorious domestic politics driven responses again attracted adverse Asian media  interest in Australian policies, particularly the T ampa incident in 2001, and the  government’s subsequent excesses in tough treatment of asylum seekers,  corresponding with a federal electoral opportunity for the coalition to win back the  One Nation constituency (see Jackman 1998).  

  Various constituencies in both Asia and Australia w ere left wondering how  Howard’s assertion of protecting Australian values and positing of a moral imperative  to act ‘above and beyond’ the region would translat e into tangible policy prescriptions  (Brenchley 1999). Australia-Asia relationships decl ined sharply in 1999 when the  region recoiled in disbelief from the Prime Ministe r’s assertion of what has become  known as the ‘Howard doctrine’. In a September issue of the  Bulletin , Howard was  interpreted as suggesting that Australia would now act as military deputy to the  United States in Asia. Gerald Henderson (2003: 11) reported that the Prime Minister’s  office adopted the so-called Howard doctrine script  and ‘…did not demur about the  deputy sheriff references’. In Parliament, the Prim e Minister described the Bulletin’s  interview story as a ‘very good article’. 

  Howard’s recasting of a more ambitious, activist Au stralian role in regional  security matters promptly became an unfolding diplo matic mess. Asian leaders  complained about unfriendly or mixed signals coming from Canberra. After a barrage  of heavy criticism, the government set about to exp unge notions of Australia as an  assistant policeman to the US superpower. Howard’s preference for closer  cooperation with traditional allies, and unbalanced  reassertion of a sentimental civism,  brought to light a remarkably poor appreciation of the power of nationalism across  Asia. Problematically, observations stemming from t he metaphor did not disappear. 

  Australia’s marginalisation within a wary neighborh ood was compounded by  Howard’s identification with Bush’s national securi ty strategy. The Bush  administrations scant regard for multilateralism an d open advocacy of permanent US  hegemony found a sympathetic, steadfast ally. One o f the effects of September 11 

   6 

  2001 was to intensify Australia-US relations. The g overnment‘s unquestioning  ‘followership’ gave full expression to Howard’s und erlying assumption that Australia  and US had identical interests and outlooks. Austra lia’s formal commitment to  the  future deployment of the controversial US ballistic  missile defence system, despite  unknown details and reparations, further threw oppo rtunities for reconciliation off  course. Critics such as Richard Butler (2001) argue d that the unproven defence  system carried great economic, political and securi ty costs. The government’s  premature statement of support for the missile defe nse program sparked renewed  criticism accusing Australia of favoring confrontat ion rather than reassurance.  

  The nadir of Australian-Asian relations was Howard’s personal advocacy, in the  aftermath of the Bali bombings on 12 October 2002, of the doctrine of preemptive  military strikes against terrorists in the immediat e region, trumpeting in advance last  resort options that statecraft usually prefers to b e as ‘deniable’ and covert as possible.  Australia’s foray into preemption was highly destab ilizing. While a casual  endorsement of an unfettered Australian right to in vade the sovereignty of other  countries might have been popular with domestic audiences, it posed a potential threat  to nearby nations. The  Times of India  (2002) noted that Australia had an obligation to  ‘signal clearly that it is not advocating state vig ilantism as an antipode to terrorism’. 

  The resultant confusion over the precise implicatio ns of Howard’s imitation of the  Bush doctrine of pre-emptive war was an invitation for trouble. Howard’s repeated  assertions failed to clarify and limit the conditio ns under which preemption might be  applied. Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Phil ippines raised concerns over the  disproportionality of Howard’s steps and his govern ment’s lack of consultation with  countries in the region. Downer attempted diplomati c damage control by conceding  that Indonesia could mount pre-emptive attacks on t errorists in Australia (Kerin  2004), making a farce of Howard’s posturing. And in January 2006, Australia  appeared poised to sign a wide-ranging security pac t with Indonesia. At its core was a  commitment from the Australia government not to intervene in Indonesia’s internal  affairs or undermine its territorial integrity. How ard’s replication of the Bush  doctrine, his rejection of ‘special relations’ in t he region and his longstanding  opposition to the ASEAN non-interference principle appeared to be cast aside. 

  In broad terms, through most of the Howard decade, Howard’s particular  conception of Australian identity, his enormous inv estment in the US alliance  relationship and his tendency to subordinate foreig n policy to calculations of  immediate domestic political advantage, appeared to  refresh or confirm the stereotype  positing that Australia was a Western outpost in an  Asian setting. Howard was to  dramatically reinforce this stereotype through his approach to the historic first East  Asian Summit in December 2005. 

  

        Asian Integration and Security Cooperation    

  From the 2002 nadir of Howard’s pre-emption doctrine, Australia’s relations with  Asia improved dramatically and at present prospects  are for the best relationship ever  (Downer 2005c). The three principal ‘drivers’ of ch ange were: an increasing  regionally inclusive pattern of moves to regional i ntegration after economic recovery  in most of Asia; developing cooperative security ar rangements reinforced by the  prospect of mutually beneficial interdependence; an d the reinforcement of integration  and security cooperation by increasing cooperation in counter-terrorism, and  prevention or damage-limitation of pandemic disease, people smuggling, and natural  disasters.  Australia has been a ‘late maturer’ in relation to the first two ‘drivers’, but  the Howard government was an active contributor to the third.       

  In his Lowy Institute speech in March 2005, Howard portrayed an expansive  vision of Australia having transformed its standing  into a credible, Western middle  power. Howard described Australia as ‘honest broker’ with a unique role as an anchor 

   7 

  of stability and peace in the region. While Austral ia’s ‘most immediate interests’ are  in our region, Howard saw ‘the balanced alignment of Australia’s global and regional  engagement is a measure of our strategic maturity’ (Howard 2005a).         Had Howard’s one reference to ‘balance’ requ iring ‘strong relationships with all  centres of power’ been sustained, it might have ope ned up wider reflections on future  cooperation with India, Japan, South Korea and Russ ia to counter-balance the  growing regional influence of China.  However, this  implicit conceptual innovation  was put in perspective by recurrent explicit refere nces to his long-standing  formulation of balancing relations with Asia (espec ially China) and the United States.  

  After several years of discussion at AUSMIN defense and foreign affairs  ministerial consultations between the United States  and Australia under the ANZUS  agreement, and in other bilateral contacts, a US-Ja pan-Australia ‘Trilateral Security  Dialogue’ that will add a new dimension to the bila teral alliances was initiated.  Australia hosted the first meeting in January 2006,  despite considerable suspicion  about such developments in China.  

  Despite these developments in deterrent military co operation, the Prime Minister  is a strong proponent of Australia’s bilateral rela tions with China. Howard personally  engaged with the conclusion of an $A25 billion gas export deal with China, and he  has supported Australia’s current negotiations towa rds a free trade agreement with  China.  He favours building on common interests rat her than being overwhelmed by  differences in relations with China and cites China ’s ‘constructive approach to a range  of security matters’ (Howard 2005a) as well as Chin a’s participation in the Asia- Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate (Howard et al. 2005).  He is  not pessimistic about the possibility of avoiding a  China-Taiwan conflict. In strong  contrast with statements by Bush administration off icials at the time, in his 2005 Asia  Society speech Howard outlined a balanced position on relations with China and  insisted that: ‘To see China’s rise in zero-sum ter ms is overly pessimistic,  intellectually misguided and potentially dangerous.   It is also a negation of what the  West has been urging on China for decades’ (Howard 2005b). 

  In contrast with his attitude to China, however, th e Prime Minister’s attitude to  regional multilateral forums, cooperative security and Asian regional integration is  considerably less positive and forward-looking than  that of the Foreign Minister. In  his Asia-Link speech, Mr Downer contrasted the United Kingdom’s belated entry into  the European Union (which limited Britain’s influen ce on the EU structures) with  Australia’s involvement in the regional integration  of Asia where Australia is ‘in at  the start’ (Downer 2005c). The Prime Minister was n ot so positive.  

  The success achieved by ASEAN as a pivotal partner of a network of free trade  negotiations with parallel cooperative security com mitments is the product of  protracted bilateral and multilateral trade diploma cy and security dialogues.   Significantly, China’s engagement and support has a lso been a vital factor in the  apparent successful progress of Asian regional inte gration.   

  ASEAN has outlived numerous dire predictions of its demise or obsolescence,  especially in 1997, survived, revived and gone on t o more substantial achievements.   The foundational Bangkok Declaration  of the Association of South East Asian  Nations (ASEAN)  defined its objectives as: promoting development; s afeguarding  stability against great-power rivalry and providing  a forum for resolving regional  disputes.  From the outset cooperative security and  (economic and cultural)  development were integral aspects of the ASEAN project. The October 2001 second  Bali  Declaration of ASEAN Concord  initiated an ASEAN Community with three  “pillars”: political-security, economic and socio-c ultural cooperation. ASEAN  continues to consolidate the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and to aspire towards  medium-term development of an Economic Community with a common currency  (Habito 2004; Lloyd & Smith 2004).  

   8 

  ASEAN’s cooperative security objectives were embodied in the ZOPFAN or Zone  of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality Declaration  adopted by ASEAN Foreign Ministers  in November 1971, the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia  and the  first Declaration of ASEAN Concord  at the 1st ASEAN Summit in Bali, in 1976, and  the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone Treaty adopted by the 5th ASEAN  Summit in Bangkok in 1995.  At the 3d ASEAN Summit the Treaty of Amity and  Cooperation in Southeast Asia  was amended with a Protocol that permitted non- ASEAN countries to accede to the Treaty, which has become an important issue in  ASEAN relations with non-ASEAN countries. China, India, Japan, Korea and the  Russian Federation acceded to the Treaty of Amity a nd Cooperation in Southeast Asia  well before the Australian Government was obliged to accede to it in 2005 as a  precondition of securing a continuing place in the negotiation of regional integration  of Eastern Asia.  

  The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) has developed since 1994 into the Asian  region’s ‘premier security forum’ (Downer 2005c). The ARF has contributed to  ASEAN’s security by promoting security dialogues for confidence-building and  conflict resolution, reinforced by growing compleme ntary non-official or ‘track two’  contacts.  The strategic potential of security dial ogues as a means of resolving  differences is perceived by the ASEAN Regional Forum members as a way of  preventing overt conflict and replacing force with peaceful resolution of differences,  as a basis for developing cooperative security arra ngements rather than military  confrontations.  In 2002, the ASEAN Regional Forum achieved significant progress  with the agreement of China and the ASEAN countries to peaceful resolution of the  claims that China and the littoral members of ASEAN make to the Spratley Islands  and several others in the South China Sea.   

  ASEAN sees comprehensive security cooperation as including non-conventional  threats like natural disasters, disease and terrori sm (Abad 2000; Pushpanathan 2003).  Cooperative security measures by Asian countries ag ainst terrorists has given a  further impetus to bilateral and multilateral coope rative security dialogues in the  region, and provided the basis for a limited and pa rtial ‘concert’ against a common  terrorist threat. Australian participation in coope rative security arrangements has  emphasized counter-terrorism, but Australia’s respo nse to the ‘Boxing Day’ 2004  Tsunami was also an important initiative. Australia ’s aid to Indonesia after the  ‘Boxing Day’ 2004 Tsunami was Australia’s largest aid package ever.   

  ASEAN is a pivotal partner of Asian regional integr ation negotiations, having free  trade agreements under negotiation with China, Japa n, South Korea, India, Australia,  and New Zealand. This was, in part, a product of th e ASEAN Regional Forum and the  ASEAN plus 3 summits.  The ASEAN Regional Forum led to ASEAN plus 3  Summits which in turn spawned multi-layered official channels, non-official or track  two and official expert reports, and “spin-off” tri lateral meetings between China,  Japan and Korea started at the third ASEAN +3 Summit in Manila in November 1999  and developed strongly (Termsak 2002). The East Asian Vision Group proposed the  consolidation of other free trade agreements into a n East Asia Economic Community  (Pengiran 2003). In 2002 ASEAN and China agreed to security cooperation and to  negotiate a free trade agreement by 2010. In 2003 A SEAN and Japan agreed to  security cooperation and to negotiate a free trade agreement by 2012. In 2004,  ASEAN and South Korea agreed to cooperative security measures and to negotiate a  free trade agreement by 2011. Building on the trila teral meetings that evolved from  their ASEAN +3 links, China has been promoting a trilateral free trade agreement  between China, Japan and Korea, to be concluded by 2007, despite complex tensions  in that grouping. 

   Australia, New Zealand, India and Russia are also participating in this process, to  expand the ASEAN +3 group. A free trade agreement between ASEAN and the  Closer Economic Relations-Australia/New Zealand (CER-ANZ) free trade area has  been developing over three decades of diplomatic di alogue between ASEAN,  Australia and New Zealand. A negotiating framework was endorsed in 2001, and in

  2004 free trade negotiations were initiated, buildi ng on bilateral free trade agreements  with Singapore and Thailand.  Australia is negotiat ing a free trade agreement with  China and ASEAN, undertaking a joint ‘feasibility s tudy’ towards a free trade  agreement with Japan and discussing a Trade and Economic Framework agreement  with India (Vaille 2005; Downer 2005a). Indian part icipation in ASEAN Summits  commenced in 2002. A framework agreement on economic cooperation was adopted  in 2003, with complementary cooperative security agreements and an ASEAN-India  free trade agreement is to be negotiated and agreed  by 2012. Russia and ASEAN  adopted agreements on economic and security cooperation at the December 2005 East  Asian Summit. Foreign Minister Downer acknowledged the obvious potential in these  developments: ‘It is not such a stretch to imagine a free trade area reaching from  Northern China to the west of India and to Stewart Island in New Zealand’ (Downer    2005c). 

  The process of Asian integration with cooperative s ecurity could ultimately  encompass and transform the three Asian ‘flashpoint s’ â Taiwan, DPRK and  Kashmir.  The potential of this process is demonstr ated by reconciliation between  China and India in April 2005, which reflects their  common relationships with the  wider ASEAN-linked integration process as well as bilateral diplomacy.  China  currently favours an East Asian Community based on ASEAN plus 3 with China  representing the Taiwan and Hong Kong economies in the relevant forums.    Developing cooperative security and supporting Indi a, Japan, Korea and possibly  Russia in balancing China’s regional influence in t his developing Asian integration  process has unparalleled strategic and economic imp ortance for Australia, but this  seems to have eluded Mr Howard. 

  

        Australia’s Re-Engagement, 2002-    

  In the light of new forms of Asian regional integra tion that created incentives to  develop cooperative security, the Howard government was encouraged by  commentaries that praised the astute nature of its regional arrangements and selective  strategic dealings (see Jennings 2005; Hartcher 200 5). Yet despite systemic shifts and  fresh opportunities to build on increasing mutual d ependence in a wider Indo-Pacific  region, the reality is that Howard’s efforts to ‘ba lance’ Australia’s ‘history’ and  ‘geography’ has been flat-footed, ad hoc and inflex ible.  

  Howard’s blanket refusal to sign the Treaty of Amit y and Cooperation (TAC) at  the 2004 ASEAN Summit in Vientiane reflected a longstanding policy blind-spot; the  resilience of a parochial political mindset with th e message that Australia did not have  to adapt or change in order to build-up its regiona l capabilities and credibility. A  meeting of ASEAN governments had made adherence to the code of conduct,  requiring signatories to refrain from interfering i n each other’s affairs and settle  disputes peacefully, a precondition for attending t he EAS to be held in Kuala Lumpur  in December 2005. The EAS may become an important new inclusive decision- making body to guide Asian integration toward a pot ential free trade area and an  embryonic EU-style community. Howard’s one-dimensional vision spoke of a  remarkable indifference to finding and forging appr opriate ways to accommodate new  regional contexts or pursuing a sense of shared sec urity interests. In contrast,  Alexander Downer appeared more comfortable and accommodating, offering to  discuss with ASEAN concerns Australia had with the conditions and criteria of the  TAC (Dodson 2005).   

  Australia was the only potential invitee that had n ot signed since China, India,  Japan, New Zealand, South Korea had, and Russia did. Howard downplayed the  importance of the summit, arguing against signing o n the grounds that the  ‘unnecessary’ pact would undermine existing allianc e duties, although other  longstanding, active US allies, such as South Korea  and Japan, had no problem in  signing. Howard’s stance was also linked to concern  that the TAC would preclude his 

   10  

  extremely vague notion of unilateral preemptive str ikes on terrorist cells in another  country. Finally, the treaty was judged as incompat ible with the government’s (highly  selective) criticisms of human rights violations in  the region. Nonetheless, while 

  confidently predicting that ‘we are not knocking on  doors begging admission â we  don’t need to do that’, Howard’s refusal to sign th e treaty jeopardised Australia’s  place in a changing region (cited in Walters 2005: 13).  

  Former Liberal Leader John Hewson described Howard’s inability to grasp the  overarching symbolic significance of the treaty as both reckless and ‘unnecessarily  churlish’ (cited in Barnes 2005).  Howard’s rebuff of overtures by regional foreign  ministers to sign on to the TAC was inconsistent wi th the high degree of ASEAN  commitment to cooperative security. Michelle Grattan observed that Australia  couldn’t have ‘… acceptance on whatever terms it chooses, excepting one rule for it  and another for others’ (Grattan 2005). Howard’s mantra of ‘being ourselves in the  region’ was merely patronizing. He evidently failed  to grasp the possibility of  pursuing new architectures for political and econom ic integration that would embrace  our main Asian trading partners.  

  In April 2005, a two-day conciliatory visit by Mala ysia’s Prime Minster Abdullah  Badawi did not disguise the fact that Malaysia rema ined noncommittal about the  prospects of Australia being invited as an inaugura l member to the summit. A few  weeks later at the Bo’ao economic forum, Badawi went out of his way to refute  Howard’s objections by declaring that ‘…no country in the world that does not wish  any harm to the countries should have any difficult y acceding to the treaty. All the  treaty obliges of them is to adopt peaceful methods  of resolving conflicts and live in  peace and harmony with the countries of the region.  It does not oblige them to  relinquish any defense treaty or terminate any mili tary alliance that they may have  with other states’ (cited in Lewis 2005: 11). Howar d attempted to bridge Australia’s  growing diplomatic isolation during a trip to China  but Beijing’s interest in  Australia’s presence at the summit appeared to be w aning. The best Howard could  allege was that encouraging remarks had been made in a private conversation with  Chinese officials.  

  By June 2005, Howard indicated that Australia was r eady to modify its position,  claiming that it was now prepared to adhere to the treaty as long as it did not interfere  with other military alliances. Kevin Rudd took aim at the government’s diplomatic  humiliation by stating that ‘…in November (2004) in Vientiane, Australia had been  invited to sign the treaty. By June in Cebu, Austra lia had been told it had to sign. How  unedifying’ (cited in Kelly 2005: 22). Howard’s nar row mindset and inattention to the  emerging Asian order of cooperative security and in tegration led to his self-defeating  insistence that Australia should be part of the his toric meeting on its own terms.  He  had also failed to sell the security and economic b enefits of the developing regional  grouping to Australian audiences, since he failed t o appreciate them himself.  

  In July 2005 the Foreign Minister announced that th e government had agreed to  accede to the Treaty, after extensive consultations  had resolved Australia’s ‘long- standing issues’ regarding the Treaty’s compatibili ty with Australia’s bilateral and  multilateral treaties and the UN Charter (Downer 20 05b).  The price of admission  having been duly paid, Australia was invited to the  inaugural East Asian Summit in  Kuala Lumpur and the preceding preparatory meeting of Foreign Ministers in  December 2005. 

  Possibly because this history, the Prime Minister’s  behaviour at the East Asian  Summit Conference was, at least, thoroughly unconstructive.  His approach to the  Summit was manifested in doorstop interviews in Kuala Lumpur. He stated that  APEC is the ‘premier body’ because it includes the United States, conceding that ‘it  doesn’t mean that other groupings are unimportant’ (Howard 2005d).  That may be an  obvious statement at an APEC Summit but it was a singularly inappropriate one to  make at an inaugural East Asian Summit in Kuala Lumpur, given the history of  Malaysia’s efforts to establish it, and its future potential. Howard also stated that 

   11  

  bilateral relations ‘will continue to be our prime focus’ rather than multilateral  forums, and, rather gratuitously, that among multil ateral forums the Doha round of the  World Trade Organisation is the ‘main game’ in multilateral trade.  Asked about a 

  free trade bloc of 16 countries, unlike Downer’s we lcome for the concept in his Asia- Link speech, the Prime Minister said dismissively t hat it was ‘far, far too early to be  talking about that’ (Howard 2005c). The East Asian Summit Chairman, Malaysia’s  Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi, not surprisingly re sponded by arguing that although  Australia may be on Asia’s doorstep it was not geog raphically part of East Asia and  should not expect to become an integral part of a f uture regional community (Levett  2005).  Astoundingly, Howard publicly welcomed his comment!  There were no  ASEAN-CERANZ summit outcomes. Howard’s diplomatic failure was underscored  by Australia’s accession to TAC being the only spec ific Australian document for the  December 2005 East Asia Summit meetings on the ASEAN Secretariat website.  

  Howard’s ill-timed enthusiasm for APEC in Kuala Lumpur reflected his idea of an  appropriate ‘balance’ between Asia and the United S tates. The coalition government,  probably led by John Howard, is to host an APEC summit conference in Sydney in  September 2007.  Prime Minister Hawke also hosted the inaugural meeting of APEC  for Australia in 1989, so the importance accorded t o APEC by both Labor and  coalition governments is evident. APEC’s importance to Australia is obvious, because  APEC’s 21 economies (including Taiwan and Hong Kong) account for 70% of  Australia’s trade, 44% of Australia’s inward invest ments, 61% of Australia’s outgoing  investments, and 8 of Australia’s 10 top export mar kets, most of which are also Asian.  APEC’s initial agenda of economic, trade and invest ment cooperation has been  expanded to include counter-terrorism, non-prolifer ation and health issues (Downer &  Vaille 2005).  

  Was it a manifestation of ‘strategic maturity’ (How ard 2005a) or diplomatic  ineptitude to celebrate a relationship with APEC th at is secure, when doing so was not  conducive to being ‘in at the start’ (Downer 2005c)  in a new forum where Australia  has unprecedented opportunities to influence new fr ameworks for economic  integration and architecture for security cooperati on with Asia?  There is no need to  ‘choose’ between APEC and Asian integration. Australia’s free trade agreement with  the United States means APEC adds less value for Australia, whereas Asian  integration (including India, which is not in APEC)  has unparalleled strategic and  economic importance for Australia, not least in the  context of both engaging China  and balancing China’s regional influence, which sho uld be high Australian policy  priorities. In this process, Australia is succeedin g despite, not because of, the Prime  Minister, whose personal prejudices have created un necessary difficulties for  Australian diplomacy. 

  

  Conclusions and Prospects    

  The central ordering principles of the Howard gover nment’s foreign policy have  remained consistent in a strongly pro-US posture an d a lower priority to disarmament,  the environment and human rights.  The salience of international environmental issues  has also changed recently with the Asia-Pacific Par tnership for Clean Development  and Climate, although the efficacy of the voluntary  approach is yet to be  demonstrated. Reacting to global patterns, counter- terrorism changed from slight  mention in 1997 to become a relatively high priorit y since 2001.  

  Howard’s Asia policy has evolved significantly from an early soft racist posture  towards Asia to a growing engagement with an emerging East Asia Community  (impeded by Howard’s parochialism but largely responding to economic  imperatives).  Australia’s relations with Asia under Howard have n ot been  straightforward and experienced both advances and s etbacks. Howard’s self-defined  mandate to realign the focus and direction of Austr alian foreign policy tended to  downgrade Australia’s regional engagement while consciously advancing images of 

   12  

  ‘national interest’ in terms that tended to emphasi ze Australia as a US aligned  Western country. Howard’s piecemeal view of Australia’s Asia linkages tended to  concentrate on trade, economic and security interes ts.   Howard’s overall conceptual framework promised to avoid abstract ‘big picture’ 

  approaches. Yet a significant drawback to his more pragmatic approach was  Howard’s static understanding of Asia that too ofte n lacked diplomatic sensitivity,  skill and strategic foresight. Howard’s government is presiding at a time of major  change in regional strategic architecture and frame works for economic integration,  with truly exciting possibilities for a liberal int ernationalist to be ‘in at the start’.  Howard seems to be engaging with this dynamic regional context through a rear-view  mirror.  As a result, Australian foreign policy has  suffered setbacks to both its  credibility and prestige while Howard’s dated and b linkered outlook has too often  diminished or damaged our place in an emerging dynamic Asian community.  

  Despite the significant opportunities in Asia, Howa rd accorded priority to APEC,  like Hawke-Keating before him in a very different i nternational context.  The next  Australian federal election would normally be due s oon after the coalition government  is to host an APEC summit conference in Sydney in September 2007 and Howard  evidently intends to chair it.   

  Howard’s Lowy Institute speech included a sentence which he may have seen as  defining his approach to foreign policy: ‘We have l earned that, if we make the right  choices, Australians can shape our environment and our destiny, not simply be takers  of trends set elsewhere’ (Howard, 31 March 2005). Whatever judgments may be made  about the Howard decade in other fields, Howard’s a pproach to foreign policy  towards Asia is likely to be seen in historical per spective as characteristically that of  ‘takers of trends set elsewhere’.
