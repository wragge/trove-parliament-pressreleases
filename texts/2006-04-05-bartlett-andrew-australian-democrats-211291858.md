 IGNORING INDONESIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE IN WEST PAPUA RESULTS  IN MORE CLAIMS FOR ASYLUM

 Reports of more asylum seekers arriving in Queensland from West Papua shows that Australia cannot  keep turning a blind eye to ongoing human rights abuses in the region.  Queensland Democrat Senator Andrew Bartlett said it is understandable for Australians to want to have  a good relationship with Indonesia, but that cannot be at the expense of ignoring basic rights for people  in our region.    

 "No relationship can genuinely be a good one unless it is based on honesty. We are now paying the  price for trying to sweep the reality of massive human rights abuses in West Papua under the carpet just  so we can get along with the Indonesian Government," Senator Bartlett said.   

 "While it is good that 42 refugees have been given protection visas, the reality is that under the law there  was no real alternative."   

 "The reaction of the Australian Government to the arrival of the refugees has been to double surveillance  efforts to prevent other West Papuans escaping persecution and just hoping that it all goes away."   

 "We cannot handle this issue by trying to put a barbed wire fence around the north of Australia and leave  West Papuans to their fate."   

 "This issue will never go away until we are prepared to openly acknowledge as a nation that human  rights abuses in West Papua are serious and ongoing, and do all we can to help the Indonesian  Government to address the situation."   

 Senator Bartlett also called on the Government to stop its expensive and unnecessary policy of  transporting all asylum seekers to Christmas Island and to provide permanent rather than temporary  visas for anybody found to be a refugee.
