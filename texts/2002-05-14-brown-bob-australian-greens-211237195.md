 Costello Takes a Chainsaw to the Environment

 Greens will Oppose Cuts for Pensioners and the Disabled

 A huge diversion of money from environment programs is revealed in the budget papers, Greens Senator Bob Brown said tonight.

 “In the current year $211.4M or 15% of proposed spending by the Howard Government on the environment has been channelled out. Despite the hottest April in Australia’s history, the Greenhouse abatement program has been cut by $126.6M or more than 50% in the current year and it will be cut by $98.3M next year,” Senator Brown said.

 Other cuts include

 â¢ Biodiversity by $67.7M in 2001/2. â¢ Sustainable land use by $122M in 2002/3 on top of an underspend of $84.6M this year. â¢ A huge cut to the Government’s much vaunted National Action Plan on Salinity adding up to $150M over 4 years.

 “To pay for massive increase in spending on border protection, the detention centre on Christmas Island and funding for the “Pacific Solution”, Mr Costello has taken a chainsaw to the environment and pensioners.

 “Australia’s environment, along with pensioners, is paying for John Howard’s inhumanity to asylum seekers.

 Senator Brown also said the Greens will totally oppose the savage curbs to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and access to disability pensions.

 “While not in the budget papers the new anti-environment mood in the treasurer’s office will fuel speculation of a huge cut to funds for managing Tasmania’s world heritage wilderness area.

 “However $2.5M has suddenly appeared for the environmentally unsound Warner Creek Dam on the Meander River near Deloraine,” Senator Brown said.

 Senator Brown welcomed the boost for Bass Strait Sea Transport Scheme.
