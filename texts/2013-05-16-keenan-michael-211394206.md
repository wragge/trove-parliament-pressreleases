 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling LABOR ATTACKS NATIONAL SECURITY  FUNDING FOR THE SIXTH YEAR IN A ROW May 16, 2013

 Two of Australia’s most important national security agencies, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Australian Crime  Commission (ACC), have had their capabilities significantly degraded by Labor’s funding and personnel cuts, Shadow  Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “The Government’s latest budget cut of $45.2 million from the AFP, on top of last year’s $133 million cut, has hindered the  agency’s ability to tackle organised and transnational crime, high tech crime, drug trafficking, major fraud, money  laundering and terrorism,” Mr Keenan said.

 “Since coming to office Labor has stripped a total of $309.7 million in funding from the AFP, which has significantly  reduced their ability to effectively do their job.

 “On top of these funding cuts the AFP have been recruited by Labor to intercept asylum seeker vessels despite having no  maritime capability and receiving no extra funding. 

 “Six years on from the 2007 election, the AFP is still waiting for the recruitment of 500 sworn officers that was promised to  them by the Labor Government.

 “This is yet another broken promise that proves that Labor is not serious about prioritising national security at a time when  gun crime and organised crime is plaguing our community.

 “The ACC is Australia’s most powerful criminal intelligence organisation yet the agency has had its funding and personnel  decreased in every Labor Budget over the last six years. 

 “The Government has cut almost 200 staff since coming to office- this cut represents 40% of their current total staffing for  the agency.

 “Labor’s budget has proved once again that they do not prioritise Australia’s national security,” Mr Keenan said.
