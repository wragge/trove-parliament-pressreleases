  'THE PLIGHT OF AUSTRALIA'S ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS'

  

  THE TOPIC YOU ARE ADDRESSING TODAY, IS ONE WHICH GENERATES MUCH INTEREST 
AND OFTEN POLARISES DEBATE. IT IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE, BUT ONE WHICH 
IS TOO OFTE N CONSIDERED FROM A SINGLE PERSPECTIVE AND IN A NARROW 
CONTEXT - OR, INDEED, OUT OF CONTEXT.

  

  * OFTEN 
ALSO IT IS CLOTHED IN LANGUAGE WHICH IS EMOTIVE OR CHARGED WITH PRECONCEPTIONS 
WHICH MERELY SERVES TO CLOUD THE REAL ISSUES AND SKEW DISCUSSION ON 
THE SUB JECT.

  

  I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE DURING LAW WEEK AND WELCOME THIS OPPORTUNITY 
TO CONTRIBUTE TO A BETTER INFORMED DISCUSSION ON THE ISSUES OF ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS IN AUSTRALIA. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS PERHAPS EVEN MORE APPROPRIATE 
GIVEN THE RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC LA ST FRIDAY OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS 
AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION'S LONG AWAITED REPORT ON THE DETENTION 
OF UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS AND ITS SUBSEQUENT TABLING IN PARLIAMENT ON 
TUESDAY.

  

 FOR THESE REASONS I PROPOSE 
TODAY TO FOCUS ON THOSE WHO ARRIVE IN AUSTRALIA WITHOUT TRAVEL DOCUMENTS 
WITH THE INTENTION OF STAYING - UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS.

  

  THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK

  

 THE LONG STANDING APPROACH 
OF SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS IS CLEAR - AUSTRALIA OPERATES A VISA ENTRY 
SYSTEM TO PROVIDE AUTHORITY TO NON-CITIZENS WISHING TO ENTER OR STAY 
IN THIS COUNTRY. THE   MIGRATION ACT 1958  REQUIRES THAT AL NON-AUSTRALIANS WHO ARE 
UNLAWFULLY IN AUSTRALIA MUST BE DETAINED AND THAT, UNLESS THEY ARE GRANTED 
PERMISSION TO REMAIN IN AUSTRALIA, THEIR REMOVAL BE EFFECTED AS SOON 
AS PRACTICABLE.

  

 THIS APPROACH REFLECTS 
THE FUNDAMENTAL LEGAL PRINCIPLE, ACCEPTED IN INTERNATIONAL LAW, THAT 
STATES HAVE THE SOVEREIGN RIGHT, AND INDEED THE RESPONSIBILITY, TO DETERMINE 
WHICH NON-CITIZENS ARE ADMITTED OR PERMITTED TO REMAIN, AND THE CONDITIONS 
UNDER WHICH THEY MAY BE REMOVED.

  

 AT THE HEART OF THIS POLICY 
IS THE NEED TO BALANCE THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT BE TEMPORARILY 
DETAINED WITH THE BROADER, FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY 
TO EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT THEIR SAFETY AND THE PUBLIC ORDER 
BY RETAINING CONTROL OVER WHO MAY ENTER AND REMAIN IN THE COUNTRY.

  

  THE NATURE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

  

 UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS 
MAY WELL BE REFUGEES IN NEED OF PROTECTION. JUST AS TRUE, UNFORTUNATELY, 
THERE IS A WORLD-WIDE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT REFUGEES, 
BUT WHO ATTEMPT TO CIRCUMVENT THE LEGITIMATE CONTROLS WHICH GOVERNMENTS 
HAVE IN PLACE ON WHO CAN ENTER THEIR COUNTRY. THEIR REASONS ARE VARIED:

  

  * THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO WORK AT WESTERN RATES OF PAY OFFERS FOR MANY UNAUTHORISED ARRI VALS 
AN IRRESIST1BLE OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES

  

  * SERIOUS 
CRIMINALS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES OF ORGANISED CRIME, TERRORISTS 
AND THOSE WHO FOR A RANGE OF REASONS MIGHT WISH TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES 
IN. AN EXPATRIATE COMMUNITY IN A USTRALIA WITH A NEW IDENTITY, 
ARE ALL CANDIDATES ATTRACTED TO THE PROSPECT OF AVOIDING THE SCRUTINY 
AND THRESHOLD TESTS OF THE LEGITIMATE ENTRY ARRANGEMENTS TO AUSTRALIA

  

  - THE POSSIBILITY 
OF ESTABLISHING A 'BRIDGEHEAD' IN A WESTERN COUNTRY TO SPONSOR LATE R 
MIGRATION BY FAMILY MEMBERS IS ALSO A STRONG DRAW CARD.

  

  THE REFUGEE CONVENTION PROVISIONS, WITH THE OBLIGATION RESTING ON 
THE STATE NOT TO   REFOULE  (THAT IS, RETURN) A REFUGEE, PROVIDES AN ATTRACTIVE 
AVENUE FOR ENTRY BY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT REFUGEES AND WOULD STAND NO CHANCE 
OF MEETING NORMAL ENTRY CRITERIA.

  

  * L ET 
ME MAKE IT CLEAR TODAY, AS I HAVE IN THE PAST, THAT I EXPECT EVERY OFFICER 
IN MY DEPARTMENT AND EVERY MEMBER OF THE RRT TO COMPLY FULLY WITH AUSTRALIA'S 
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE REFUGEES CONVENTION

  

  * EQUALLY, 
IT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE PRESERVATION OF PUBLI C ORDER, AND TO 
THE MAINTENANCE OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CREDIBILITY OF REFUGEE 
CONVENTION PROTECTION ARRANGEMENTS, THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT REFUGEES 
BE REMOVED IF THEY HAVE NO OTHER LEGITIMATE CLAIMS TO STAY IN THIS COUNTRY.

  

  PEOPLE SMUGGLING

  

 THE PRESSURE ON AUSTRALIA'S 
VISA ENTRY CONTROLS, AS WITH OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES IS GROWING RAPIDLY. 
AUSTRALIA IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE DESTINATION AND MOVEMENTS OF PEOPLE, 
TRAVELLING ON FORGED TRAVEL DOCUMENTS AND/OR ARRIVING AT BORDERS UNDOCUMENTED, 
ARE ON THE INCREASE, NOT ONLY IN AUSTRALIA BUT WORLD-WIDE.

  

 FOR MANY PEOPLE THIS REPRESENTS 
JUST ANOTHER IMMORAL BUT HIGHLY PROFITABLE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. ORGANISATIONS 
INVOLVED IN PEOPLE TRAFFICKING - SMUGGLING THEM AS IF THEY WERE JUST 
SO MUCH CONTRABAND - ARE DOING VERY GOOD TRADE. THEIR PLANS ARE OFTEN 
COMPLEX, INVOLVING RECRUITMENT OF PASSENGERS, PURCHASE OR FORGERY OF 
TRAVEL DOCUMENTS AND ITINERARIES WHICH OFFER TRANSIT THROUGH SEVERAL 
COUNTRIES BEFORE ARRIVAL IN THE EVENTUAL DESTINATION COUNTRY.

  

 IT HAS BEEN APPARENT FOR 
QUITE SOME TIME NOW THAT THERE ARE SMUGGLING NETWORKS OPERATING THROUGHOUT 
CHINA, SOUTH-EAST ASIA AND AUSTRALIA TO ASSIST ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO 
ENTER AUSTRALIA. INCREASINGLY, EVEN BOAT ARRIVALS IN AUSTRALIA HAW TENDED 
TO COME FROM OUTSIDE THE   REGION. CHARACTERISTICALLY, THESE ARRIVALS FLY INTO THE REGION   AND GATHER 
IN SMALL GROUPS READY FOR TRANSHIPMENT BY BOAT ON THE LAST LEG TO AUSTRALIA.

  

 THOSE WHO USE THESE   SMUGGLING 
SCHEMES UNDOUBTEDLY PAY HEAVILY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. UNDOUBTEDLY ALSO, 
MANY TRAVELLERS HAVE BEEN PROMISED BY THE ORGANISERS THAT THEY WOULD 
BE ALLOWED TO STAY IN AUSTRALIA AND WOULD QUICKLY BE ABLE TO WORK TO 
RECOUP THE COST OF TRAVELLING.

  

 THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ATTEMPTING 
TO ENTER AUSTRALIA ILLEGALLY CONTINUES TO INCREASE. IN 1994-95 WE DETECTED 
485 PEOPLE ATTEMPTING TO ENTER AUSTRALIA ILLEGALLY. IN 1996-97 THIS 
FIGURE JUMPED TO 663 IN (AN INCREASE OF 36.7%). IN 1996-97 THE NUMBER 
INCREASED AGAIN TO 1350 PEOPLE (AN INCREASE OF 103% OYER THE PREVIOUS 
YEAR). ON THE BASIS OF THE LATEST FIGURES AVAILABLE, THE NUMBER LOOKS 
LIKE INCREASING AGAIN TO ABOUT 1,700 PEOPLE.

  

 AS A SIGNATORY TO THE 
CONVENTION AND PROTOCOL RELATING TO THE STATUS OF REFUGEES, AUSTRALIA 
HAS OBLIGATIONS TO PEOPLE WHO SEEK ASYLUM IN AUSTRALIA REGARDLESS OF 
WHETHER THEY ARRIVE HERE LEGALLY, OR ILLEGALLY. THESE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE 
PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ANY CLAMS WHICH MAY ENGAGE AUSTRALIA'S 
PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS. ONE THING IS CERTAIN FROM CURRENT TRENDS IN 
UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS - THERE WILL BE NO FORESEEABLE SHORTAGE OF PEOPLE 
ARRIVING WITHOUT AUTHORITY AND CLAIMING REFUGEE PROTECTION IN AUSTRALIA.

  

  MEETING THE CHALLENGES

  

 WHEN THIS GOVERNMENT CAME 
TO POWER, FRANKLY THERE WERE A NUMBER OF KEY AREAS WHERE I SAW THE NEED 
FOR IMPROVEMENT AND IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS SINCE ACTED DECISIVELY

  

  * WE HAVE 
IMPROVED AND STREAMLINED THE ONSHORE PROTECTION DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES 
AND TO ENSURE THEY ARE PROPERLY RESOURCED.

  

  - AS A RESULT 
PRIMARY PROCESSING TIMES FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS IN DETENTION HAVE REDUCED 
FROM 132 DA YS IN 1993-94 TO AN AVERAGE NOW OF 51 DAYS. OUR ONSHORE 
PROTECTION ARRANGEMENTS ARE RECOGNISED WIDELY AS AMONGST THE BEST IN 
THE WORLD.

  

  * WE HAVE 
MOVED TO ENSURE THAT DETENTION DOES NOT BECOME ARBITRARY BY DEVELOPING 
AND STRENGTHENING INDIVIDUAL CASE MANA GEMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR 
DETAINEES, INCLUDING THROUGH REGULAR MEETINGS OF SENIOR IMMIGRATION 
DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS TO REVIEW EACH DETAINEE'S SITUATION.

  

 * WE HAVE DEVELOPED A SET OF CLEAR IMMIGRATION DETENTION STANDARDS 
IN CONSULTATION WITH THE OFFICE OF THE COMMONWEALTH OMBUDSMAN TO DOCUMENT 
THE LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS OF DETAINEES IN TERMS OF THEIR TREATMENT 
WHILE IN DETENTION. DIMA HAS ALSO UNDERTAKEN A COMPREHENSIVE TENDER 
PROCESS TO SELECT A NEW IMMIGRATION DETENTION SERVICE PROVIDER, AUSTRALASIAN 
CORRECTIONAL SERVICES.

  

  * SINCE 
ACS ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTRES IN 
LATE l997, A RANGE OF PRACTICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO HEALTH, EDUCATIONAL 
AND RECREATIONAL SERVICES WITHIN THE CENTRES HAS BEEN INTRODUCED, AND 
FOOD SERVICES HAVE BEEN REVIEWED AND UPGR ADED. THIS WORK WILL 
CONTINUE WITH ACS AS OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS IN DETENTION 
CENTRES ARISE.

  .

  * SOME $72M 
HAS BEEN SPENT OYER THE LAST THREE YEARS ON MAJOR UPGRADES TO THE PORT 
HEDLAND DETENTION FACILITY.

  

  * MORE RECENTLY, 
YOU WOULD ALL BE AW ARE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET DECISION TO 
FUND THE FULL REDEVELOPMENT OF THE VILLAWOOD IDC TO ESTABLISH A NEW, 
SAFE AND CULTURALLY SENSITIVE DETENTION FACILITY ON THE SITE.

  

  ON A WIDER FRONT, I HAVE LONG BEEN CONCERNED AT THE NEED TO STRIKE 
A MORE APPROPR IATE BALANCE BETWEEN THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE 
ONSHORE TO CHALLENGE AND REVIEW MIGRATION DECISIONS AND THE CONSIDERABLE 
SCOPE THAT THESE AVENUES OFFER TO THOSE WHO MERELY WANT TO PROLONG THEIR 
STAY HERE.

  

  * UNFORTUNATELY 
THE ROBUST IMMIGRATION REVIEW TRI BUNAL AND REFUGEE REVIEW TRIBUNAL 
PROCESSES HAVE NOT DELIVERED THEIR DESIRED OBJECTIVE OF REDUCING COSTLY 
AND DELAYING APPEALS TO THE COURT SYSTEM.

  

  - SINCE 
THE INTRODUCTION OF THE TRIBUNALS, RECOURSE TO THE COURTS IN MIGRATION 
MATTERS HAS BALLOONED FROM A  CASELOAD OF AROUND 250 APPLICANTS 
TO OVER 900 IN 1997,

  

  - MIGRATION 
MATTERS NOW TAKE UP 65% OF THE FEDERAL COURTS ADMINISTRATIVE LAW CASELOAD.

  

  I HAVE DRAWN CRITICISM IN SOME QUARTERS FOR PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSING 
MY CONCERN THAT THE COURTS HAVE NOT BEEN CARR YING OUT THEIR PROPER 
ROLE IN RELATION TO JUDICIAL REVIEW.

  

 THERE IS ROOM FOR THE 
PROPOSITION THAT THERE IS SOME FORM OF MERITS REVIEW GOING ON UNDER 
THE DISGUISE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW AND THAT THIS PRACTICE IS CONTRIBUTING, 
AT LEAST PARTIALLY, TO THE INCREASES IN RECOURSE TO LITIGATION IN MIGRATION 
ISSUES.

  

 JUDICIAL REVIEW SHOULD 
NOT BE A WORD-BY-WORD EXAMINATION OF THE REASONS GIVEN BY THE ORIGINAL 
DECISION-MAKER IN A NIT-PICKING SEARCH FOR LEGAL ERRORS. BUT YOU NEED 
NOT RELY ON MY WORD FOR THAT. LET ME QUOTE TO YOU WHAT THE HIGH COURT 
SAID IN 1996 IN A MIGRATION CASE CALLED WU SHAN LIANG; '... THE REASONS 
OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION-MAKER ARE MEANT TO INFORM AND NOT TO BE 
SCRUTINISED UPON OVER-ZEALOUS JUDICIAL REVIEW BY SEEKING TO DISCERN 
WHETHER SOME INADEQUACY MAY BE GLEANED FROM THE WAY IN WHICH THE REASONS 
ARE EXPRESSED'.

  

 RECENTLY IN A SPECIAL 
LEAVE APPLICATION TO THE HIGH COURT, JUSTICE GAUDRON HAD CAUSE TO RECALL 
WHAT WAS SAID IN THE CASE OF WU SHAN LIANG AND JUSTICE GUMMOW COMMENTED 
THAT MAYBE ONE HAS TO SAY AGAIN WHAT WAS SAID IN THAT CASE.

  

 I DON'T WANT IT THOUGHT 
THAT I'M ALWAYS CRITICAL OF THE COURTS AND NEVER HAVE ANYTHING POSITIVE 
TO SAY ABOUT THEM. I COMMEND THE FEDERAL COURT IN SYDNEY AND MELBOURNE 
IN ITS EFFORTS TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESSES OF JUDICIAL REVIEW IN MIGRATION 
CASES. AND, IT IS TRUE THAT THE FEDERAL COURT HAS BEEN MAKING REFERENCES 
IN ITS JUDGMENTS TO WHAT THE HIGH COURT SAID IN WU SHAN LIANG.

  

 THE FACT REMAINS, HOWEVER, 
THAT PARTICULARLY IN ASYLUM CASES, ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION MAKING HAPPENS 
EFFICIENTLY, OBJECTIVELY AND IN PERIODS OF DAYS OR WEEKS. BY CONTRAST, 
ENTRY INTO THE AVENUE OF LITIGATION:

  

  * INCREASES 
THE COST TO THE TAXPAYER BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE

  

  * TIES UP 
COURT TIME DELAYING OTHER CASES, AND

  

  * IMPORTANTLY, 
PROLONGS THE  PROCESS OF REMOVAL OF UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS BY MONTHS 
AT LEAST, AND IN MANY CASES BY YEARS.

  

  FOR VARIOUS REASONS THIS LATTER CONSEQUENCE CAN BE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE 
TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE LONGER THEY STAY, THE BETTER THEIR CHANCES 
ARE OF REMAINI NG PERMANENTLY.

  

  THE GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AMONGST THE 
VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW BODIES THROUGH REDUCING THE NUMBER OF 
DISTINCT JURISDICTIONS. YOU WOULD ALSO BE AWARE OF MEASURES INTRODUCED 
BY THIS GOVERNMENT AND PASSED B Y THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
ON 24 SEPTEMBER 1997 AIMED AT REDUCING THE INCIDENCE OF COSTLY AND TIME 
INTENSIVE LITIGATION ON MIGRATION DECISIONS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
EXHAUSTIVELY CONSIDERED.

  

 B0TH OF THESE INITIATIVES 
HOLD THE PROSPECT FOR FURTHER REDUCING THE OPPORTUNITIES OF UNAUTHORISED 
ARRIVALS TO TAKE ACTION MERELY TO FRUSTRATE THEIR SPEEDY REMOVAL WHERE 
THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND NOT TO HAVE CLAMS TO STAY HERE.

  

  HREOC REPORT

  

 MANY OF YOU WILL BY NOW 
HAVE HEARD MUCH ABOUT THE CONTENT OF THE RECENT HREOC REPORT ON THE   DETENTION OF UNAUTHORISED 
ARRIVALS  AND MIGHT FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT I AND THE 
COMMISSION ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS. IT IS 
ACCORDINGLY APPROPRIATE, WITHOUT GETTING INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL, FOR ME 
TO PROVIDE SOME MORE FOCUSSED COMMENTS ON THE REPORT.

  

 THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN 
INDICATING FOR SOME YEARS ITS OPPOSITION TO THE LEGISLATIVE ARRANGEMENTS 
FOR THE DETENTION OF UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS UNTIL THEY ARE IDENTIFIED, 
ANY CLAMS TO STAY ARE ASSESSED, AND THEIR REMOVAL (IF REQUIRED) OCCURS.

  

 I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT 
IS DISAPOINTING THAT THE COMMISSION'S REPORT HAS DONE LITTLE TO DISPEL 
THE MYTHS AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT HOW UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS TO THIS 
COUNTRY ARE TREATED.

  

 FAR FROM COMING   'ACROSS THE SEAS'  AS THE REPORT TITLE SUGGESTS, UNAUTHORISED 
ARRIVALS PREDOMINANTLY AND INCREASINGLY COME TO THIS COUNTRY BY AIR. 
THERE ARE NOW ONLY TWENTY-EIGHT SO-CALLED   'BOAT ARRIVALS'  IN DETENTION, INCLUDING NINE WHO ARRIVED OVER 
THE WEEKEND OF 9-10 MAY. BY COMPARISON UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS BY AIR 
ARE RUNNING AT SOME 1,700 PER ANNUM AND THE TOTAL IMMIGRATION DETAINEE 
POPULATION IS RUNNING AT SOME 362 PEOPLE

  

 THIS IS HARDLY THE PICTURE 
OF A DETENTION SYSTEM SWAMPED BY BOAT ARRIVALS OR OF A SYSTEM CLOGGED 
WITH LONG-TERM DETAINEES.

  

 THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S 
DEPARTMENT HAS ADVISFD THAT THE POLICY OF DETAINING UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS 
IN PRINCIPLE IS NOT IN BREACH OF AUSTRALIA'S INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS 
OBLIGATIONS.

  

 THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN 
REMINDED OF THIS AUTHORITATIVE ADVICE SEVERAL TIMES IN THE LEAD UP TO 
THE PUBLICATION OF ITS REPORT, BUT APPEARS TO PREFER ITS OWN INTERPRETATIONS.

  

 OUR LEGAL ADVICE DOES 
NOT STAND ALONE. THE COMMISSION WOULD ALSO BE WELL AWARE THAT THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S 
DEPARTMENTS ADVICE IN THIS REGARD IS CONSISTENT WITH THE VIEW OF UNITED 
NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTEE THAT THE DETENTION OF UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS 
DOES NOT PER SE BREACH OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT 
ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS.

  

 THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE 
ON MIGRATION ALSO EXAMINED AND BROADLY ENDORSED THE COMMONWEALTH POLICY 
OF MANDATORY DETENTION OF UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS IN 1994.

  

  * THE COMMITTEE 
EXPRESSED CONCERNS OYER THE COST AND PRACTIC ALITY OF SUGGESTED 
ALTERNATIVES WHICH WOULD AS A GENERAL RULE HAVE SEEN UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS 
AT LARGE IN THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY WHILE THEY ARGUE THEIR CLAIMS TO 
STAY HERE.

  

  BEHIND THE RHETORIC ABOUT ALTERNATIVES TO DETENTION LIES THE REALITY 
OF HUMAN NA TURE.

  

  * THESE 
PEOPLE, WHETHER ARRIVING BY BOAT OR BY SR, HAVE GONE TO CONSIDERABLE 
EXPENSE AND EFFORT IN COMING TO AUSTRALIA.

  

  * IT IS 
CRITICAL THAT THEY REMAIN AVAILABLE TO ENSURE THEIR TIMELY PARTICIPATION 
IN THE ASSESSMENT OF ANY CLAIMS TO STAY, AND FO R REMOVAL IF THEY 
ARE UNSUCCESSFUL

  

  * NO REALISTIC 
SUGGESTIONS HAVE BEEN PUT TO GUARANTEE EITHER OUTCOME ONCE THEY ARE 
AT LARGE IN THE COMMUNITY.

  

  IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS ARE 
ENSURING   AVAILABILITY  AND NOT ABOUT   PUNISHMENT  THE CURRENT ARRANGEMENTS ALSO DO NOT REQUIRE DETENTION 
IN ALL CASES. WERE ARE SAFEGUARD PROVISIONS IN PLACE TO GRANT BRIDGING 
VISAS SO THAT UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS CAN BE RELEASED FROM DETENTION IN 
EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS FOR THOSE UNDER 18 OR OVER 75 YEARS' 
OLD, THOSE IN NEED OF RELEASE ON MEDICAL GROUNDS AND WHERE A VISA APPLICANT 
HAS NOT RECEIVED A DECISION WITHIN SIX MONTHS.

  

 IT IS WORTHWHILE TO NOTE 
THAT, IN ADDITION TO THE 28 BOAT ARRIVALS CURRENTLY IN DETENTION, THERE 
ARE A FURTHER 28 BOAT ARRIVALS CURRENTLY IN AUSTRALIA WHO HAVE BEEN 
GIVEN BRIDGING VISAS SO THAT THEY CAN PURSUE THEIR CLAIMS WHILE LIVING 
IN THE AUSTRAL1AN COMMUNITY.

  

 THESE VISAS HAVE BEEN 
GRANTED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, FOR EXAMPLE TO TORTURE AND TRAUMA SUFFERERS, 
UNACCOMPANIED MINORS AND WHERE WE BEST INTERESTS OF CHILDREN ARE INVOLVED. 
THE FIGURES SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. THIS IS HARDLY A PICTURE OF AN INFLEXIBLE 
AND ARBITRARY DETENTION PROCESS.

  

 THE REPORTS FINDINGS OF 
MISTREATMENT AND POOR SERVICES IN DETENTION ALSO FALL WELL WIDE OF THE 
MARK AND SEEM TO REFLECT WHAT WOULD APPEAR TO BE

  

  * THE COMMISSION'S 
ADOPTION OF CLAIMS MADE BY DETAINEES WITHOUT ROBUST ASSESSMENT OF THE 
REAL PICTURE,

  

  * WHAT I 
UNDERSTAND IS ITS SELECTIVE USE OF THE EVIDENCE PUT TO IT BY THE DEPARTMENT; 
AND

  

  * NOT RECOGNISING 
THAT CONDITIONS AND SERVICES HAVE BEEN IMP ROVED SIGNIFICANTLY 
OVER RECENT YEARS.

  

  IN PARTICULAR, MEDICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES ARE EXTENSIVE AT ALL 
DETENTION CENTRES. THEY ARE PROVIDED BY QUALIFIED MEDICAL PERSONNEL, 
ETH SPECIALISED TREATMENT GIVEN, AS IT IS FOR THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY, 
ON TH E BASIS OF REFERRALS FROM QUALIFIED MEDICAL PERSONNEL.

 .

  * IN ADDITION, 
FORMAL TRAINING GIVEN TO IMMIGRATION DETENTION OFFICERS SPECIFICALLY 
ADDRESSES THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF IMMIGRATION DETAINEES AND THOSE WHO MAY 
BE SEEKING ASYLUM, OR SUFFERING DEPRESSION A ND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS.

  

  THE QUITE SENSATIONAL ASSERTIONS THAT THE BEHAVIOURAL PROBLEMS OF 
DETAINEES ARE MET WITH ISOLATION, SEDATION AND SHACKLING ARE TOTALLY 
MISLEADING.

  

  * DETAINEES 
INVOLVED IN VIOLENCE HAVE ON OCCASIONS, BEEN PHYSICALLY RESTRAINED FO R 
SHORT PERIODS. ALL STAFF ARE TRAINED TO USE ONLY REASONABLE MINIMUM 
FORCE.

  

  - ON THIS 
ISSUE I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE POINT THAT BY AND LARGE THE DETAINEE 
POPULATION IS COOPERATIVE AND PEACEFUL. THE IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTRE 
ENVIRONMENTS ARE VERY LOW S ECURITY AND WE RELY HEAVILY ON VOLUNTARY 
COMPLIANCE AND GOOD WILL WITH DETAINEES FOR THE SMOOTH OPERATION OF 
OUR CENTRES.

  

  * SEDATION 
(WHAT THE COMMISSION CALLS CHEMICAL RESTRAINT) IS NOT USED AS A PUNITIVE 
OR SECURITY MEASURE. THE INCIDENT CITED BY THE CO MMISSION RELATES 
TO DETAINEES RECEIVING MEDICAL TREATMENT FROM A PRIVATE DOCTOR CALLED 
IN TO HELP THEM.

  

  * INDIVIDUALS 
CAN BE HELD TEMPORARILY IN OBSERVATION ROOMS. THIS IS FOR CLEARLY DEFINED 
SECURITY REASONS, INCLUDING ON OCCASIONS, FOR THEIR OWN PROTECT ION, 
OR IN CASES WHERE HEIGHTENED CARE NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED TO THEM IN THEIR 
OWN BEST INTERESTS. THIS IN NO WAY COMPROMISES THEIR RIGHTS TO REQUEST 
ACCESS TO LEGAL ADVISORS, MEDICAL ASSISTANCE OR TO SEEK CONSULAR VISITS.

  

  IN TERMS OF GENERAL CONDITIONS, AC S RUNS A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS 
WITHIN THE IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTRES WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO DETAINEE 
DEVELOPMENT AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THESE INCLUDE EDUCATION SERVICES FOR 
CHILDREN AND ADULTS, INCLUDING ENGLISH-LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION, CULTURAL 
CLASSES, SUCH AS HANDICRAFTS AND COOKING, AND SPORTING ACTIVITIES. ALL 
DETAINEES ARE ALSO FREE TO PRACTICE THEIR RELIGION OF CHOICE, AND RELIGIOUS 
SERVICES ARE CONDUCTED WITHIN THE CENTRES ON SPECIAL OBSERVANCE DAYS.

  

 THE REPORTS ARGUMENTS 
THAT SOMEHOW DIMA HAS IGNORED MATERIAL WHICH SHOWED THAT SOME DETAINEES 
MIGHT PRIMA FACIE BE ENGAGING AUSTRALIA'S PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS IS 
PARTICULARLY DISAPPOINTING. THE GOVERNMENT HAS GONE TO CONSIDERABLE 
EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT POTENTIAL REFUGEES ARE QUICKLY IDENTIFIED IN THE 
FLOW OF UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS TO THIS COUNTRY AND TO ENSURE THAT THEY 
ARE QUICKLY BROUGHT INTO THE ONSHORE PROTECTION PROCESSES.

  

 THE PASSAGES   CITED IN SUPPORT OF THE REPORT'S ASSERTIONS ARE TAKEN OUT 
OF CONTEXT AND DO NOT OBJECTIVELY PRESENT THE ACCOUNTS GIVEN BY THESE 
INDIVIDUALS.   
THERE SEEMS INSTEAD TO BE AN UNDERLYING BELIEF IN THE REPORT THAT ANYONE 
WHO SAYS THAT THEY WANT TO STAY HERE FOR WHATEVER GROUNDS OR THAT THEY 
DO NOT WANT TO GO HOME IS SOMEHOW TRIGGERING OUR INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION 
OBLIGATIONS.

  

 SIMILARLY, THE GOVERNMENT 
TAKES VERY SERIOUSLY HREOC REPORT FINDINGS THAT DIMA HAS DELAYED IN 
PROVIDING REASONABLE FACILITIES TO DETAINEES TO ACCESS LEGAL ADVICE. 
TO REACH ITS CONCLUSIONS, THE REPORT APPEARS TO INCORRECTLY CONSTRUE 
THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE THESE REASONABLE FACILITIES TO INCLUDE ENSURING 
THE ACTUAL RECEIPT BY THE DETAINEE OF THAT ADVICE IN A TIMELY FASHION 
AND TO A STANDARD THEY FIND SATISFACTORY. THESE MATTERS ARE CLEARLY 
ONES FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO ADDRESS WITHIN THE RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS 
OR HER LEGAL ADVISER, OR IF UNSATISFIED TO TAKE UP IN THE RELEVANT PROFESSIONAL 
COMPLAINTS PROCESS.

  

 SIMILARLY, THE COMMISSION 
APPEARS TO HAVE MISINTERPRETED THE MEANING OF CORRESPONDENCE FROM DETAINEES 
TO THE DEPARTMENT WHERE DIMA CONSIDERS THAT THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE 
REASONABLE FACILITIES IS NOT BEING CALLED UPON, THE COMMISSION ALSO 
DOES NOT APPEAR TO RECOGNISE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT 
ACTUALLY PROVIDING REASONABLE FACILITIES TO A DETAINEE AND THE TIMING 
OF ITS FORMAL ANSWERS TO THEIR CORRESPONDENCE.

  

  THE COMMISSION DOES MAKE SOME VALID POINTS ABOUT THE NEED TO IMPROVE 
THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS AT SOME IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTRES. THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS PUT IN CONSIDERABLE EFFORT TO IMPROVE DETENTION FACILITIES AND CONDITIONS, 
AND WILL CONTINUE THIS IN CON JUNCTION WITH THE NEW SERVICE PROVIDER 
DRAWING ON THE COMMENTS MADE IN THE HREOC REPORT.

  

  CONCLUSION

  

 IN CLOSING, I HOPE THAT 
I HAVE TODAY INJECTED SOME BALANCE AND OBJECTIVITY INTO WHAT IS OFTEN 
AN EMOTIVE 'FACT FREE ZONE’. LET ME EMPHASISE:

  

  * NO DEMOCRA TIC 
GOVERNMENT ENGAGES IN THE DETENTION OF INDIVIDUALS LIGHTLY, BUT THERE 
ARE CRITICAL PUBLIC ORDER AND SECURITY ISSUES INVOLVED;

  .

  * PROLONGED 
DETENTION OF UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS IS IN NO ONES INTEREST AND I WILL 
CONTINUE TO MAKE IT ONE OF MY HIGHEST PRIOR ITIES TO ENSURE THAT 
ANY VISA PROCESSES ARE SPEEDY, OBJECTIVE AND THOROUGH;

  

  - THAT PERIODS 
OF DETENTION OF UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS ARE KEPT AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE; 
AND

  

  - THAT CONDITIONS 
OF DETENTION SENSITIVELY REFLECT THE DIVERSE CULTURAL, EDUCATIONAL, 
HEAL TH AND RECREATIONAL NEEDS OF DETAINEES;

  

  * 

  BUT THE 
RESPONSIBILTY FOR ANTSNING PUBLIC ORDER AND SECURITY FALLS ON THE SHOULDERS 
OF GOVERNMENT. IT IS A CRITICAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ONE WHICH I WILL 
NOT SHIRK.

  

  * AS IS 
THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THE IN TERNATIONAL SAFETY NET 
FOR REFUGEES ESTABLISHED UNDER THE REFUGEES CONVENTION AND PROTOCOL 
IS NOT EXPLOITED AND DEBASED BY THOSE MERELY SEEKING ECONOMIC OR PERSONAL 
GAIN.

  

  THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TODAY
