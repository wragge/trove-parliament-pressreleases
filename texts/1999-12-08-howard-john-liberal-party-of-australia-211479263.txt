  Thank you very much Mr Chairman and Ladies and Gentlemen.

  It is now almost four years since the Coalition Government 
was elected in March of 1996 and I thought it would therefore be useful 
if I tried in the few moments available to me to give a brief account 
of the stewardship of the Government over that period of time and most 
particularly over the last 12 months.

  It is important when giving an overview of that kind 
to recall the broad goals that the Government set itself in March of 
1996. Because it is all too easy in politics to focus far too heavily 
on the micro detail of day to day policy decisions and administrative 
actions and to lose sight of the fact that collectively they are but 
means to achieving certain overall goals. Every Government elected to 
office in this country has certain national broad aspirations, has a 
desire in the period of its office, whether it be long or short, to 
bring about beneficial change for the aggregate benefit of as many Australians 
as possible.

  And so it was with the Coalition Government taking 
office for the first time in 13 years in March of 1996. We set ourselves 
a number of goals, we set ourselves the goal, a very general but very 
desirable one, of strengthening our country. Of strengthening it economically, 
strengthening it socially and strengthening it internationally.

  I think I can report to the nation that over the 
four years, and particularly over the last 12 months, we have achieved 
to goal of strengthening Australia economically. The economic performance 
of this country at the moment is as strong as it has been at any time 
since the end of World War II - in some respects, even stronger - because 
we operate in a more open, competitive international environment, we 
are less protected, we have, and may I acknowledge our predecessors 
did in a number of areas, embrace essential changes and reforms, and 
that has collectively given us a fundamental generic economic strength 
that we have not had for some time.

  We sought to strengthen the country socially by recognising 
that it was important to draw upon the fundamental values and instincts 
of the Australian community. One of the things that I have endeavoured 
to do as Prime Minister is to develop what I chose to call in my Federation 
Address at the beginning of this year, an ‘Australian way’ or an 
Australian approach to handling particular problems, and out of that 
we have developed the notion of a social coalition.

  I don’t suggest that that notion isn’t found 
in some manifestation in other parts of the world but I haven’t consciously 
sought to apply some kind of foreign paradigm to the notion of how we 
marshal the resources of all of the people and all of the institutions 
of this country.

  The social coalition seeks to recognise a reality 
and that is that the government alone cannot solve all of the social 
problems of a nation. The great welfare institutions of our society 
acting alone cannot hope to do so, individuals acting alone cannot hope 
to do so, although they have a role to play and responsibilities to 
assume and obligations in appropriate cases to return to the general 
community, and finally of course the business community’s primary 
role is producing economic wealth, but it does have a contributory role 
to play in relation to social policy.

  And what the social coalition seeks to do is to draw 
upon those four elements and working together to tackle problems in 
a somewhat different and in many cases innovative way, and for the first 
time we have more heavily involved many of the welfare organisations 
at the policy making end as well as at the compassion end of delivering 
social policy.

  We have sought through a series of initiatives to 
encourage greater participation by the business community. My cry has 
been not that business should give more, but rather that more businesses 
should give because there are many outstanding examples in the Australian 
community of the generosity of individual businesses.

  We have not sought through 
the social coalition in any way to withdraw from the traditional role 
of government in Australian society. The traditional role of Government 
in Australian society has been that the Government should have a limited 
role, that tha  t role should be strategic. Part of the strategic 
role of Government is to support and provide and nurture a social security 
underpinning or social security safety net.

  And it has never been the aim of the Government I 
lead to drive the Government proportion of gross domestic product down 
ever lower as an end in itself, but rather to recognise that there are 
roles for Government in our community, they are limited, but they are 
important and they are strategic.

  And as we come to the end of this century, I hope 
to believe that we may have found a reasonable balance in relation to 
the roles of Government and the roles of business within our community.

  And the third of the goals we set ourselves was of 
course the strength of Australia internationally. There were many elements 
of the foreign policy of the former government that we found agreement 
with, and its always desirable to have a certain continuity of foreign 
policy as administrations change. It is never in the national interest 
to change policy merely for the sake of reminding the world that a new 
government has taken over.

  But we have sought in the time that we’ve been 
in office to bring about some re-balancing. To move away from what I 
thought on occasions looked a little like an ‘Asia- only’ focus 
by the former Government to what I have called an ‘Asia first’ focus 
whereby we recognise that although our political, economic and strategic 
linkages with the Asian Pacific are far and away our most important 
and would continue to be so, we also have very important strategic and 
foreign policy and economic linkages with other parts of the world.

  And many of you have heard me before speak of what 
I regard as that special intersection of history, culture, geography 
and economic circumstance that I believe Australia occupies, with our 
strong links of all sorts of kinds with Europe and North America that 
our strategic and geographic placement here in the Asian Pacific world. 
And indeed that intersection and the unique insight that it gives to 
this country was very much at work in recent months in the role that 
we discharged in relation to East Timor.

  So they were, ladies and gentlemen, some of the broad 
goals that we set ourselves almost four years ago.

  Becoming more up to date, when I delivered my second 
Federation Address in Brisbane of this year, I said that the Government 
had five broad goals for 1999. I said that we were resolved first and 
foremost to continue to pursue policies that will maintain our remarkable 
rate of economic growth and economic strengths. I think I can report 
to you and to the Australian people that we have in fact achieved that 
goal and in some respects achieved it beyond the expectation that we 
had at the beginning of 1999.

  There is the hope that not only will we be able to 
report in a years time that we were able to stare down the Asian economic 
downturn, but in fact we might have begun to get some of the benefits 
of the upswing that is now beginning to occur in some parts of Asia.

  I said secondly that we remain absolutely committed 
to the implementation in full of our visionary tax plan endorsed by 
the Australian people at the last election. And absent the 10 to 15 
per cent as I have described it that was taken out in negotiations with 
the Australian Democrats I can report that the Parliament has endorsed 
and we are in the process of implementing that taxation plan which is 
the biggest change to our taxation system, probably ever and certainly 
the biggest since the end of World War II, and will return to this country 
very major net economic benefits. It is important when the focus is 
inevitably on some of the detail and the argument and the political 
debate is about some of the detail, it is important to remember that 
the big game, the big story out of tax reform, are the major benefits 
to the Australian economy. The lower business costs, the lower export 
costs, the lower fuel costs to the bush, the major cuts in personal 
income tax, the quite dramatic and very beneficial changes to the business 
taxation system that will give us a world competitive rate of company 
tax that will dramatically cut almost in half in many cases the rate 
of capital gains tax, which will stimulate a higher level still of foreign 
investment in this country.

  And the story of tax reform 
is the story of giving to this country an even better economic chance, 
as we go into the next century, of making an already very competitive 
Australian economy, even more competitive. And giving to of course 80 
per cent of Austr  alian tax payers a personal rate of income tax at 
the margin that can never go higher than 30 per cent.

  Thirdly, I said that we would not tire in our efforts 
to further reduce unemployment, which although at an eight year low 
is still too high, and once again I can report to you that we have made 
progress. Not as much as I would have liked, but more than I though 
at one stage during the year it would be possible. Even some of the 
more conservative of the Government’s economic advisers are now suggesting 
to us that with current policy settings, and they include of course 
a continuation of a strong rate of economic growth, we might see unemployment 
go even lower.

  Fourthly we are going to extend out commitment to 
the principle of mutual obligation in Australian society and certainly 
I can report again that we have been very active on that front, the 
extension of the work for the dole, the introduction in relation to 
the drug offensive, of the diversion programs in cooperation with the 
states. The details of that I launched in Sydney only a few weeks ago 
and yesterday the Health Minister went to Tasmania to announce in cooperation 
with the Premier of Tasmania the diversion programme which is built 
upon, once again, the principle of mutual obligation - that society 
has an obligation to do everything it can to assist people who want 
to break the drug habit. And we have a very special social responsibility 
to do that and I don’t pretend that this is an easy challenge and 
I don’t pretend that the solutions are simple but part of the process 
must be to confront people who do wish to break the habit with the reality 
that if they are to get assistance, if they are to avoid being caught 
up in the criminal justice system then they should avail themselves 
of treatment and rehabilitation facilities.

  And finally I said in my address earlier this year 
that we would work to create an even stronger social coalition to more 
effectively remedy areas of disadvantage and under-privilege and I have 
already spoken earlier of the importance that I place on the building 
of a strong social coalition in this country. So as we come to the end 
of this year and as we reflect upon what has occurred and it has by 
any definition been a remarkably active and a remarkably productive 
year but from my point of view and the Government’s point of view 
it has not so much been the individual policy decisions but the contribution 
that those policy decisions have made towards achieving those broad 
goals that I recalled at the beginning of my address.

  Of course the year has also been characterised, as 
political years always are and years in the life of the nation always 
are, by events that could not reasonably have been foreseen certainly 
in the way they worked out at the beginning of the year. And clearly 
Australia’s involvement in providing hope and a future for the people 
of East Timor very much comes into that category. It was without doubt 
the most important international event to effect Australia during the 
year. It saw for the first time Australia leading an international peace 
enforcement operation. It saw Australia assert herself in an appropriate 
and sensible way - not a provocative or over-reactive way in our part 
of the region - in a way that has brought lasting credit to our nation 
and lasting credit in particular to the men and women of the Australian 
Defence Force. It represented the act of a country that sought not argument 
or disputation with the Republic of Indonesia but rather a country and 
an Government that sought to discharge its obligations to a group of 
people who in earlier years had more than discharged their obligations 
to Australians of an earlier generation. And I believe that history 
will see the Australian action in East Timor in a positive light. History 
will see Australia as having acted in an appropriate, a restrained, 
but nonetheless very determined, very definitive way.

  Throwing forward to the year 
ahead it’s a clichÃ© to say that it will be a very active year. I 
see the role of the Government in the year ahead being very much one 
of continuing to pursue, in the name of achieving the goals I outlined, 
the economic reform p  rogramme that has been a characteristic of our time 
in Government. There is a lot of talk in our community about whether 
the reform process has gone too far, whether we have reform fatigue. 
Once again it is a question of achieving an appropriate balance. The 
reform process never stops. In a sense, once governments give up on 
reform then the community is entitled to question the continued value 
of that government to the community. Reforms of course must take account 
of the impact of change on our community. There is an ever present obligation 
on governments to explain and interpret economic reform and the benefits 
of change and reform to their communities and their societies and if 
we don’t do that resistance - much of it ill-informed - will build 
to the process of reform.

  It is fair to say that Australia at the present time 
in a national generic sense is enjoying great prosperity and great economic 
strengths. That situation imposes a special obligation on all of us 
to make sure that all sections of the community as best we can enjoy 
and share in the benefits of that national economic well-being and economic 
strength. And I think particularly of those of my fellow Australians 
who live in the rural and regional areas of our nation. Historically 
and now in present terms contributing so much to our export income, 
so much to our wealth and also importantly, so much to our understanding 
of what it is to be an Australian. And I have often said in the past 
that I cannot conceive the Australia that I grew up to love as being 
an Australia that doesn’t have the bush and the rural and regional 
parts of our country as very much part and parcel of how we see ourselves 
and how we relate to ourselves as an Australian community. And it is 
a special obligation to make sure therefore as best we can, in the months 
ahead and indeed in the years ahead, that the benefits of national economic 
strengths are enjoyed by many of our Australian citizens as is humanly 
possible. Because when the country is doing well those who aren’t 
doing well feel the disadvantage ever more keenly and ever more acutely 
and that puts a very special obligation on us.

  I will seek, and the Government will seek in the 
months ahead, to make certain that we continue all we can to reduce 
our current level of unemployment. Unemployment in Australia has now 
assumed a markedly varied character in the sense that there are large 
parts of Australia particularly in some of the large cities, where for 
practical purpose, unemployment has been reduced to an almost irreducible 
minimum. There are many of the central districts of Sydney where the 
unemployment rate is in the order of slightly below or slightly above 
2%. And yet if we move into some of the regional areas, the change is 
quite dramatic and quite marked. And that once again underlines the 
point I make about the need for reaching out and ensuring the best available 
assistance consistent with national economic goals is made available 
to people in rural and regional Australia. And we will seek over the 
year ahead of course to complete the successful and smooth implementation 
of our taxation reforms. They are important reforms, their implementation 
in a smooth effective manner is an important priority of the government.

  We will also seek in the year ahead to build a sensible 
but restrained an non provocative way on the new sense of respect, and 
I believe strength, in which Australia is viewed internationally. We 
have been a very good regional neighbour - not only of Indonesia but 
also of nations such as Thailand and Korea. We have a capacity to play 
a crucial role in the economic and political development of the region 
and our capacity to do so is enhanced by our economic strength and our 
capacity to do so has also been enhanced by our diplomatic standing 
in relation to East Timor.

  And finally, ladies and gentlemen, 
we will seek in the year ahead, to do something that I said was very 
important to me and to the Government that I lead when I accepted the 
verdict, very pleasingly I might say, of the Australian people on the 
2   nd  March 1996. And that was to try and 
focus on those things that united the Australian community rather than 
those things that divided them. Because I have long held the belief 
in public life that the things that unite us as Australians are infinitely 
more enduring and more lasting and more effective and more important 
than the things that divide us. And if there is one goal that any government 
worth its salt should set itself and that is to do everything it can 
to bind together and to unite the Australian people. And if there is 
one thing - and I say it finally - that I can say with every conviction 
that we have been true to over the last almost four years, and that 
is that we have not been a government that has been beholden to any 
one section of the Australian community. We have not been a government 
that has been owned by one section, we have not been a government that 
has pursued an obsessive agenda out of deference to one section of the 
Australian community. We have rather been a government that has sought 
as best we could to govern for all Australians.

  Thank you.

  JOURNALIST  :

  Tony Wright from   The Age  , Prime Minister. Your review today has been pretty 
much about the last years of this century, and we are just about move 
into another century and millennium. And yesterday of course you knocked 
over a couple of records of the great Liberal Prime Minister Menzies 
with cricket scores and by your own lights a better economy. I wonder 
whether you attempted at any stage to go for that last record - 16 
years as a Liberal Prime Minister? And perhaps more realistically, as 
you’ll be going to another election in a couple of years, would you 
be prepared to commit to serving another full term as Prime Minister 
should you win that election, and God and passing trucks willing?

  PRIME MINISTER:

  Well thank you Tony. My position on this has really 
been quite consistent. I take one election at a time. And I said that 
after the last election. I’m in good health. But I’m a realist. 
I take one election at a time. If my party wants me to lead them to 
the next election then I will be happy to do so. I remind all of you 
that I don’t hold the office I now have other than by the courtesy 
and the gift of the Liberal Party of Australia. It’s not mine to pass 
on, it’s not mine to do a deal with anybody about. It is an office 
that I hold out of the courtesy of the Liberal Party and my position 
is that if the party wants me to lead them to another election I’d 
be very happy to do so. What happens after that I will deal with on 
a term to term basis. I’m not getting into the exaggerated business 
of projecting beyond that. I really think that would be both presumptuous 
and unrealistic.

  JOURNALIST:

  Gay Davidson…[inaudible]. Anyway I wanted to ask 
you Prime Minister what your reaction was when Indonesia scrapped the 
East Timor [inaudible] on protest agreement? And have you had any.…that 
was two days ago. Have you had any intelligence more about it? What 
diplomatic moves have you made? Have you given any advice to the American 
Government who will of course be clearly intrigued about this whole 
thing considering their interest not only in oil but also this sort 
of strength?

  PRIME MINISTER:

  You’ll appreciate that I can’t go into any detail 
about intelligence advice. The view of the Government is that nothing 
that has happened so far threatens the arrangements that we’ve made. 
We think that applying some of the notions of successor states in international 
law that there won’t be any difficulty in working out an understanding 
in relation to that.

  JOURNALIST:

  Prime Minister, Vivienne Stanton from Reuters. After 
your famous school report card speech to Parliament earlier this year, 
we know that you see quite a bit of talent in your frontbench. I was 
just wondering how soon you’re planning to rearrange the desks, and 
who will get to be a prefect and who will get sent to the back of the 
class?

  PRIME MINISTER:

  Well I don’t have anything in mind on that front. 
When, if I were to well I’d announce it. Were we to make any changes 
I’d announce them. But I think the team is doing very well. But I 
also think that I’ve got a lot of talent on the backbench.

  JOURNALIST:

  Malcolm Farr, the   Daily Telegraph . In your 
25 years in Parliament, have you known politicians to be held in the 
low standing that they are today? And going back to the referendum but 
without please going to the issues of the referendum, do you think a 
consequence of the ‘no’ case tactic or strategy of saying politicians 
cannot be trusted would exasperate the current low standing of politicians. 
What would you do to raise the level of respect of politicians and consequently 
of the Parliament?

  PRIME MINISTER:

  Well I don’t know that the attitude has perhaps 
changed as much as people including journalists and some Parliamentarians 
often say. I think there’s always been a bit of that sort of healthy 
scepticism in this country towards people in authority. I was asked 
by President Clinton when he came to Australian in 1996, we had a talk 
about some of the comparisons between Americans and Australians. And 
I said that I thought one of the differences between Americans and Australians 
was that Australians were somewhat more sceptical as a people than Americans. 
And that’s no bad thing. It may be aggravating for us on occasions 
but it is no bad thing. It’s I think part of our Celtic inheritance 
that we have a certain scepticism. So I’m not sure that it’s got 
so dramatically worse. I mean we all say that. I don’t know that it’s 
changed quite as much. What would I do to change it? I don’t think 
there’s any one thing you can do. You can only do your best. Try and 
talk to people as candidly as possible. Try and understand what motivates 
the mainstream of the Australian community. Don’t get captured by 
interest groups. Don’t get too remote in not only a geographic sense 
but in a sense of understanding what the broad community feels. You 
asked me about the ‘no’ campaign. Well the ‘no’ campaign had 
a lot of elements and had a lot of contributors. Different people put 
it in a different way. You wouldn’t have found anything I said that 
involved any denigration of politicians. I had a view. My view was that 
we shouldn’t change. Now I haven’t come here today to sort of rehearse 
the referendum, you shake your head and I’m glad to hear that you 
haven’t either. But I don’t know that out of that there was any 
great further damage done. But I’m prepared to be accountable, and 
bear in mind it was a free vote, and when you have a free vote the Prime 
Minister has the same privilege that’s accorded to every other member. 
And I’m very happy to have anything I said during the campaign subject 
to very close scrutiny.

  JOURNALIST:

  Amanda Buckley, Bloomberg News, Prime Minister. I 
just wanted to ask you about privatisation today. We know it was very 
much on the Government’s agenda when you came into office, and you’ve 
had some very big sales and I think 40% of Australians are now shareholders 
as a result. But I’m wondering whether you’ve run out of a bit of 
steam on this issue. We know that your Treasurer is very keen to get 
more sales and we know that he’d like to sell the remaining 50.1% 
of Telstra to eliminate Commonwealth debt. We know there’s less enthusiasm 
in the National Party, perhaps reflecting what you said about that reform 
fatigue out there in the community. And I’m just wondering if you 
do have a timetable in your own mind for the rest of Telstra, if you 
can tell is where Sydney Airport is in the queue at the moment - I know 
there’s a bit of a back up of big decisions coming along on that score 
- and give us some idea of what the Government’s privatisation program 
will be in future?

  PRIME MINISTER:

  Amanda, the policy on Telstra hasn’t changed. The 
policy on Telstra is that we still have it as a goal to sell the lot 
but we made a commitment to….once we got to where we are now we have 
an examination process in relation to the adequacy of services particularly 
in regional Australia. And only if we were satisfied from that would 
we then go on. But the goal hasn’t changed and it’s not as far as 
I’m concerned likely to change. I would like to remind people, particularly 
those in regional Australia who might be listening to this program, 
that a lot of the benefits that are now going to the bush, for example 
the rural transaction centres. And I opened the first of them at Eugowra 
about six or eight weeks ago. And they’re being funded out of the 
sale of Telstra, the second tranche. So there are a lot of benefits 
that will only flow to the bush if we continue down the path of privatisation, 
as well as the debt retirement benefits that would accrue. Sydney Airport, 
you mean the possibility of any extensions, any further ones. That is 
still on the table. We’ll probably be having a look at that in the 
near future. I can’t tell you exactly when. As to further privatisation, 
well, there does come a point at which it’s fair to say well we’ve 
privatised, us and the former Government, have privatised most of the 
Government’s business enterprises. I think we’ve achieved a world 
first in relation to the privatisation of the employment services market, 
and that was another example of the Australian way. I don’t think 
any other western country had done that and it’s been very successful. 
And I think it’s been particularly well handled.

  JOURNALIST:

  Craig Johnstone from the   Courier Mail,  Mr Howard. 
One issue that you have yet to resolve finally and fully is native title. 
The Democrats are demanding that you give the Senate more power, a lot 
more power to vet future changes to State base legislation. Are you 
of the mind to grant them their wish and if so how do you get that past 
the National Party?

  PRIME MINISTER:

  Well there’s a single decision making process in 
the Government. Everybody makes their contribution. Craig, I know you’re 
referring there to sort of amendments the Democrats want to sort of 
require Senate approval of any subsequent amendment to a State based 
regime. That’s a proposition that’s been put up. I think it’s 
fair to say that that matter is still under discussion with the interested 
parties and the stakeholders. I would that the thing had been finally 
put to bed. It has been substantially but not completely and we just 
have to keep persevering. I mean one of things that I’ve learnt this 
year is that what you have to try and do is to achieve outcome with 
the electoral and institutional assets that you have rather than pretend 
that wouldn’t it be better if we had more. And the fact is we don’t 
have a majority in the Senate and I recognise that, and I’ve tried, 
consistent with the broad goals of the Government, where we have to 
negotiate with the Democrats to get sensible outcomes. And we’ve been 
I think pretty successful. As to what the outcome of that other point 
will be I’m not in a position to say at the moment. It’s still being 
discussed.

  JOURNALIST:

  Dennis Grant Prime Minister from SBS Television. 
A week ago in this very room your Foreign Minister addressed the club 
and he mounted the argument that as a function of Australia’s response 
to a variety of foreign policy challenges, he observed the Asian meltdown 
and East Timor . But Australia was entitled to a new level of respect 
in the region. He also pointed out that since 1975 Australian Prime 
Ministers have visited Jakarta no less than 12 times. Indonesian Presidents 
have visited since 1975 no times to Australia. My question relates, 
to respect, when you finally do get to meet Abdurraham Wahid, the new 
President, should that meeting take place in Jakarta or here in Canberra?

  PRIME MINISTER:

  Well, for a very good foreign policy and diplomatic 
reason I am not going to express a view on that question because it’s 
far too early in the rebuilding process for me to start saying either 
when a meeting should take place or where it should take place. I think 
everybody is aware that there is a grass growing over the wound process 
to be gone through as far as our relationship with Jakarta is concerned 
and we are working on that. But it will take time. It would be naive 
to imagine that it wouldn’t take time and when that time has elapsed 
then it might be more appropriate for me to venture an answer to the 
question.

  JOURNALIST:

  Richard McGregor. Prime Minister, in defending Australia’s 
record on refugees and also the latest regulations on that you often 
sight with understandable pride the Coalition’s record on Indo-Chinese 
boat people in the late ‘70s who are a group, incidentally, who would 
be excluded from staying here under the latest rules. But in a context 
of what you say are our compassionate policies, why is it, as you said 
on Adelaide talkback radio last week, I think, why do you think it’s 
quite unreasonable to provide air-conditioning to the boat people in 
Woomera in a desert area where I think the, you know, for a month of 
the year temperatures are over 40 degrees? And do you also think that 
the Australian people, as I think you said in the same interview, were 
justifiably annoyed that air-conditioning would be provided in that 
service?

  PRIME MINISTER:

  Well, the reason I said it, Richard, was that there 
are many Australians in many parts of Australia who would be living 
in equally difficult climatic circumstances who don’t have air-conditioning. 
And the test of reasonableness is properly to be judged according to 
the Australian standard and I don’t find that an unreasonable attitude 
to take. I think my fellow Australians would think it would be unreasonable 
if I had any other attitude.

  JOURNALIST:

  Mr Howard, Dennis Shanahan from   The  Australian . You mentioned 
earlier Australia’s strength in the region both economically and diplomatically 
and have suggested that we’ll have a new strength as a result of the 
respect from our position on East Timor. Just two points coming from 
that - what evidence do you have of the newfound strength and respect 
from the region in relation to our actions in East Timor and if the 
economy does continue to roll along will it be necessary to apply the 
Timor tax?

  PRIME MINISTER:

  Well, Dennis, the evidence…you put that in two 
parts. I mean, the first and most important thing to remember is, and 
this is often overlooked in the understandable but nonetheless limited 
focus on the Indonesian reaction to the exclusion of the reaction to 
other countries. You have got to remember that three of the ASEAN countries 
have made very significant contributions to the INTERFET force and a 
couple of those were in one part, you know, significantly the result 
of some approaches from Australia and in another part certainly involved 
approaches from Australia. And I can report that I am very well satisfied 
with the willingness of countries like Thailand and the Philippines 
and Korea to contribute to the INTERFET force. And ultimately, of course, 
to the United Nations blue helmet force as I am satisfied with the contribution, 
the financial contribution, that Japan has made. Now, that speaks of 
some immediate evidence. In the longer term it is a reality of international 
life that if a country has economic strength and is able to help in 
times of need and crisis but also that country takes a decisive stance 
in relation to a difficult international issue and a stance that can 
and, in fact, did involve incredibly, you know, high areas of risk particularly 
their own personnel and that has been successful then it is normally 
the case that that country is accorded a higher level of respect and 
regard. Now, I don’t overstate it but I think it’s very important 
that we don’t understate it either. I think it would be a mistake 
to assume that the only reaction in the region is the reaction of, sort 
of, awkwardness and difficulty concerning our association with Indonesian. 
Now, that is a particular issue that I have dealt with and has to be 
addressed in a measured, careful way. But it’s also the case that 
in other parts of the region the stance we have taken would be seen 
in a very positive light.

  JOURNALIST:

  James Grubel from AAP, Mr Howard. You may have noticed 
there’s a little bit of publicity around today about the remuneration 
tribunal and its findings yesterday about MPs pay rises. Two months 
ago you were on radio saying that the public would be justified in being 
a little bit upset if the pay rises were of the level of about 10 per 
cent and now we find that they are between 10 and 15 per cent. Can they 
be justified at a time when you are urging corporate Australia and wage 
and salary earners to show restraint?

  PRIME MINISTER:

  Well, I think you may have, with respect, slightly 
misrepresented what I said. I think what I said was that in paraphrase 
that I didn’t think any increase would be popular because it never 
is. But I think I also said that it would not be unreasonable if the 
increase essentially reflected the movements in average wages that have 
occurred since the last increase and that basically is what has happened. 
Now, it is a fact of political life that whenever there is a pay rise 
people have a go including most of you and really get stuck into us. 
I mean, there are some notable exceptions that didn’t really have 
a go but others joined the traditional sort of….I mean, I accept that’s 
part of the game. But, you know, just let me make the point that there 
has been no adjustment since October of ’96. The adjustment recommended 
by the tribunal will merely bring it to where it would have been essentially 
if there had been an average wage adjustment. In other words, if our 
salaries in October ’96 had gone up in accordance with average wage 
movements over the last three years we would now be where the remuneration 
tribunal will put us on the 1  st  of July next year. Now, I 
don’t think, even though that’s not popular and it won’t be liked, 
I don’t think that is unreasonable. I don’t think that bears any 
comparison at all to some of the extraordinarily generous executive 
salaries that are paid. I mean, I am talking of the huge share bonuses, 
I am talking of some of the remuneration in the billions. I mean, there 
is a vast difference but having said all of that I don’t expect that 
to be absorbed and accepted in the community, it’s just part of, I 
guess, the nature of a system in which we operate. But I said when I 
was asked about this a couple of months ago that I wasn’t going to 
be shy about defending a reasonable adjustment. I think it has been 
reasonable. I think it’s very good that from now on if there’s any 
increase it will just be the average increase that the rest of the community 
has got. I have personally wanted that for a long time because I think 
that is the best way of doing it because it is the most defensible way 
and it stops this ridiculous situation where you have no rise for several 
years and inevitably, by definition, a rise that then occurs to bring 
you back to where you should have been looks big although in reality 
it’s not big. And that’s what’s happened on this occasion.

  JOURNALIST:

  Michelle Grattan, Sydney Morning Herald. Mr Howard, 
the second wave of your industrial relations reforms have been knocked 
over, do you think further labour market adjustment is vital and if 
so what is your next step? Is it to consider using the corporations 
power to get a united system, a national system?

  PRIME MINISTER:

  Michelle, further industrial relations reform is 
desirable. We have achieved a lot. The benefits in terms of increased 
productivity out of the reforms we have so far achieved are not as widely 
acknowledged as they should be. If there’s a, sort of, an unsung hero, 
heroic part of the economic reform then I don’t enough credit has 
been given to the productivity spin-off and the IR reforms of ’96. 
And one of the good things about the Australia economy over the last 
couple of years is that our productivity has gone up. Now, some of that 
is due to the spin-offs of information technology and you can find a 
dramatic parallel here with what is occurring in the United States. 
But some of it is also due to labour market reforms and I don’t think 
we have given ourselves, in a sense, enough credit, as much credit as 
we should. But there are further reforms that are desirable. Do they 
include the corporations power? That is on the table, yes. We are not, 
sort of, talking about dying in a ditch on that but it is certainly 
on the table.
