 BOWEN EYES SWAN’S JOB AS MORE BOATS ARRIVE   

 An opinion piece in The Australian today by hapless Immigration Minister Chris  Bowen on the economy shows Julia Gillard has lost all control.   

 Bowen has proved incapable of resolving Labor’s rolling border protection crisis, yet  he finds time to make a pathetic pitch for Wayne Swan’s job as more boats arrive.   

 The fact the likes of Bowen are out so publicly jostling for other positions further  demonstrates the level of dysfunction within this government.   

 Julia Gillard has no authority, commands no respect and has no control over her  ministers.   

 Bowen meanwhile has been a dismal failure in Immigration, apparently offering to  resign at one stage.    

 All of his attention should be focused on fixing the myriad problems in his own  backyard, including continuing cost blow-outs.
