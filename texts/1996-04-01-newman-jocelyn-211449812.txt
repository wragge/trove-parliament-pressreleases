  The Government e)...'Pects that new entrants to Australia will provide for their ov.-n  support during their first two years in Australia. . 

  Migrants who enter Australia from today will be subject to a minimum two year  waiting period. This -will extend the CUITent provision that new migrants should  wait 26 weeks before they get access to Social Security payments, which was  introduced by the Keating Government. 

  Officials from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, both  overseas and in Australia. have been actively advising intending entrants to  Australia and any sponsors oftrus prospective change. 

  "The two year waiting period will not apply to refugees or special hmnanitarian  migrap.ts, in recognition of the special circumstances of their entry to Australia, It  Senator Newman said. . 

  Migrants whose financial circumstances change significantly after arrival to  Australia, for reasons beyond their control, may also be eligible for Special  Benefit. This will be adminjstered tightly and fairly so that those in significant  financial hardship will be protected, consistent with the intentions of the  Australian Social Security system. 

  The Govenunent Vtill be introducing amending legislation into the Parliament  shortly.

  Senator Ne\Vlllan said that there will be no change to the residence requirements  for Social Security pensions. Retired people need 10 years residence in Australia  before they can receive an age pensio~ and other pensions have a requirement of  at least five years residence. 

  The changes announced by the Coalition are modest and reasonable, and will  ensure taxpayers only pay for those in need.
