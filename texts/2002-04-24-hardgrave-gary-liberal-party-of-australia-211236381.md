 Gary Hardgrave MP   Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs 

   Media Release H41/2002 - 24 April 2002

  

 Call for Multicultural Australia to Participate in ANZAC Day

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, has invited all Australians, including newly arrived migrants and refugees, to observe ANZAC Day as one of our most important symbols that unifies us as a nation.

 "Whether we have been in this great country for five years or five generations, ANZAC Day has relevance for all of us in the Australian family," Mr Hardgrave said. "Sharing the ANZAC legacy not only honours all Australian men and women who have defended our values of peace and freedom, but it also supports our personal and community efforts to preserve community harmony and our democratic traditions in Australia."

 Mr Hardgrave said for many migrants and refugees, Australian troops or our allies were seen as liberators and some had fought side by side with our forces, such as Polish soldiers at Tobruk. He welcomed the strong multicultural participation in ANZAC Day marches across Australia, particularly by post-war migrants who made a strong contribution to nation-building after the war.

 "However, amongst some of our newer community groups there may be a lack of understanding about what the tradition stands for," he said. "Though there are encouraging signs of a growing interest in ANZAC Day which the Government is keen to foster. For instance, some of the Somalian community in my electorate have nothing but praise for the work done in their region by Australian peacekeepers."

 "There may be a reluctance to participate in what some may perceive as a commemoration only for ANZAC troops and their descendants," he said. "However, the spirit of ANZAC symbolises a more inclusive celebration of our internal community harmony and readiness to take responsibility to maintain international peace. The common bond of citizenship we share is at the heart of a unified and inclusive Australia."

 "Our values provide us the freedom we enjoy in Australia to express our respective cultural heritages and our respect for each other. We enjoy this freedom in the context of an overall commitment to our country and its basic structures. Our structures are the respect for parliamentary democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, English as our national language, the equality of all Australians, and the rule of law.

 "Australian multiculturalism celebrates the rich cultural diversity of Australia, including the unique status of Indigenous Australians as the traditional custodians of our land, the mainly Anglo-Celtic peoples who form the majority Australian population, and the people from over 150 countries who have made Australia their home. Together, we have worked to create a nation the ANZAC troops would be proud of today."

 "I encourage all Australians to take pride in our ANZAC tradition - it is our symbol of how much we value freedom and democracy, how much we value each other and our commitment to Australia's community harmony."
