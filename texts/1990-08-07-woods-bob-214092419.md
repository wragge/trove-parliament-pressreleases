 COALITION CALLS FOR REJECTION OF AIDS POSITIVE MIGRANTS

 Figures released at the International Conference on AIDS which  indicate that the Asia-Pacific region is now following the trend  seen in sub-Saharan Africa, where 1 in 40 men and women are  infected with the HIV virus, are good reason for the Federal  Government to reject refugees and intending migrants who are HIV  positive/ Federal .  Shadow Minister for Health Dr Bob Woods 

 announced today.

 " The Coalition policy provides for a system of mandatory testing  for all refugees and intending migrants, on a cost recovery basis  for the latter, with a negative result being a prerequisite for  health approval to enter Australia" Dr Woods said today.

 "Presently while the Federal Government has adopted the  Coalition's policy of compulsory testing for intending migrants  it does not automatically reject those who test HIV positive.

 With predictions that 1.5 million people from the Asia-Pacific  region will be infected with the HIV virus by the year 2000 we  must take precautions.

 The Coalition does not believe that compulsory testing of the  whole Australian population would be feasible on ethical,  logistic or economic grounds.

 Testing intending migrants however is reasonable. We currently  exclude Tuberculosis sufferers from migrating to Australia and  there is no reason why we should not also exclude people infected  with the h i v virus."
