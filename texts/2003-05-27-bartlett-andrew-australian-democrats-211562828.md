 Denying Child’s Visit is Plain Cruel 

 

 The Howard Government is deliberately and cruelly punishing children to make a political point,  the Australian Democrats said today.   

 Democrats’ Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said he was sponsoring 14-year-old Pakistani Asma  Sharaz who has twice been denied a visitors visa to attend memorial services for her father.   

 Asma Sharaz is the daughter of Shahraz Kayani, who arrived in Australia as a refugee from  Pakistan and later became an Australian citizen. Mr Kayani set himself alight outside Parliament  House in 2001 because his family’s attempts to join him in Australia were rejected on the grounds  one of his daughters suffers cerebral palsy.   

 Shahraz Kayani died from his injuries on May 27, 2001.   

 Senator Bartlett said he was sponsoring Asma because she had been refused the chance to join her  relatives for the memorial service for her father held at the public entrance of Parliament House this  morning.   

 “Punishing children to make a political point is plain heartless,” Senator Bartlett said.   

 “This is a tragic case of the Howard Government failing to understand they are dealing with real  people.   

 “Mr Kayani became so desperate as a result of the Department’s refusal to let his family join him  that he set himself alight on the steps of Parliament House.   

 “Mr Kayani fought for six years to have his family join him before he resorted to his drastic protest.   

 “His children are still being punished.”
