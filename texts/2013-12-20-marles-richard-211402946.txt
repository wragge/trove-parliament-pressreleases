 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 ANOTHER TURNAROUND ON ASYLUM POLICY BY ABBOTT  GOVERNMENT   

 Today, Australians learn of yet another instalment of the Abbott Government’s  incompetence when it comes to its immigration policies.   

 Yesterday evening, under the cover of a quiet note uploaded to the Attorney-General Department’s website, the Government overturned the cap on protection  visas for the 2013-14 year.   

 The Abbott Government has have revoked the cap on protection visas within  hours of a High Court Challenge.   

 Where is the resolve the Minister continues to promise?   

 “Our resolve has not wavered. There are no exceptions.”  - Minister Scott Morrison, Media Release 4 December 2013.  This is yet another shambolic demonstration of the Government’s shambolic  policy on the run approach to immigration and asylum seeker policy.
