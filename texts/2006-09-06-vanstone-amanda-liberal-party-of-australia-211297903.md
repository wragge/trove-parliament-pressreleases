 Australia Welcomes 1234 in Need in August 

 6 September 2006 

 Victoria embraced 406 refugee and humanitarian entrants in August from the 1234  welcomed to Australia last month. Queensland, South Australia, New South Wales and  Western Australia welcomed 732 entrants between them as Australia continued to provide a  home for those most in need. 

 The refugee and humanitarian entrants who arrived in August settled across Australia as  follows: 

 “This Government’s commitment to maintaining tough border security plays an integral part  in enabling Australia to offer 13,000 places annually under the refugee and humanitarian  program,” Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, said. 

 “Because we have limited the number of unauthorized arrivals seeking asylum, we’re able to  give our places to those waiting patiently in camps throughout the world. 

 “Of those to arrive in August, 518 were refugees. Many of these people have been waiting in  refugee camps for years. 

 “Australians can be proud that we provide a secure home for these people, who have  already suffered enough by being forced to flee their country of nationality. 

 “These people have been determined to be refugees by the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and assessed to be in need of resettlement.” 

 The remaining 716 people were Special Humanitarian Program (SHP) entrants. They were  forced to leave their home country after being subject to substantial discrimination. They  also have family or other links with Australia .  

 Included in the 1234 arrivals were 787 people from Africa , 370 people from the Middle East  and South West Asia, and 64 people from South East Asia .  

 “In August there were 24 family groups (a total of 87 people) who were granted visas under  a dedicated programme for women at risk. These are women and their dependants who  have lost male family members and are therefore particularly vulnerable," Senator Vanstone  said.
