 Australian Immigration Minister Reconfirms No Special Arrangements for Zimbabweans Australia's Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today reconfirmed that while Australia is watching the situation closely, at this time there were no special arrangements for Zimbabweans to enter Australia.

 Australia has a non-discriminatory immigration program and Zimbabweans, like anyone else, are free to apply to enter Australia through normal channels. However, to be granted a visa for Australia they must meet existing visa criteria.

 Mr Ruddock explained that Zimbabweans could explore a number of possibilities for entering Australia including a range of business migration opportunities. Interested people should contact the nearest Australian post.

 Because of the increased interest from people in Zimbabwe, the Department of Immigration will be examining staff needs in Harare to address the increased workload.

 The Minister said that Australia will also consult with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on appropriate responses, if there is a significant movement of people out of Zimbabwe.
