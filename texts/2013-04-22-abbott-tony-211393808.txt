 TONY ABBOTT:    

 It's good to be here in Perth with Michael Keenan, the Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs. As you've  just seen, we've unveiled a new billboard which exposes the fact that this government has totally lost control  of our borders. Michael and I came together here in Perth three years ago and at that stage, the then mobile  billboard recorded that there had simply been 112 boats and just over 5,000 illegal arrivals by boat. I regret  to say that now there have been 641 illegal boats and there have been more than 38,000 illegal arrivals by  boat. It doesn't matter what this government says. The situation is just getting worse and worse and worse.  As with everything this government does, they make a bad situation worse.     

 Now, this is not just a border protection problem, it's also a Budget problem because we've had more than  $6.5 billion of additional border protection costs because of this government's failure to leave in place the  policies that worked under the Howard Government. Now, this really is a total failure by a bad government,  a total failure by a bad government, and I want to pledge to the Australian people that we will make a  difference. Should we win the election, we will make a difference from day one. We will put in place the  policies that work and we know what policies that work are: it's temporary protection visas to deny the  people smugglers a product to sell; rigorous offshore processing in places like Nauru; the readiness to turn  boats around where it's safe to do so, and much better relations with Indonesia. We had good relations with  Indonesia before, we can have it again under a Coalition government.     

 I'm going to ask Michael Keenan to say a few words and then obviously I will take some questions. I should  acknowledge the presence of Darryl Moore, our candidate for Perth, who obviously is very concerned about  these issues, as are so many people in this electorate.    

 MICHAEL KEENAN:     

 Thank you, Tony. It’s great to welcome you to Western Australia again. When three years ago we launched  the billboard, the figure of 112 illegal boat arrivals was a very significant figure because in the years  previously under the Howard Government, we’d had an average of three illegal boat arrivals per year and  that 112 figure was so significant that two months later Julia Gillard rolled the then Prime Minister Kevin

 Rudd and sighted border protection as one of the reasons that she was required to do that. Yet subsequently,  in the almost three years following, she has presided over more illegal boat arrivals than any Prime Minister  before her - 502 boat arrivals as of today. That dwarfs Kevin Rudd’s record. Julia Gillard is the Prime  Minister who has presided over the complete collapse of an orderly immigration system in Australia. Over  30,000 people have arrived under her watch and she’s not doing the job of the Federal Government, which is  one of their most serious jobs - to protect our borders, to control our immigration system and to make sure  that it’s the Australian people who have some say over who comes to our country.     

 TONY ABBOTT:     

 Ok. Do we have any questions?     

 QUESTION:     

 Mr Abbott, won’t turning the boats back put Australian servicemen at risk?    

 TONY ABBOTT:     

 I don’t pretend for a second that this is simple or easy, but it can be done, it has been done and it will be  done where it’s safe to do so. Now, I have a lot of faith in the professionalism of the Royal Australian Navy  and I am confident that what they have done in the past they can do again in the future, if needs be.     

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, in the West Australian on the weekend there was a report of an alleged Egyptian terrorist who is  in a detention centre in the eastern states. What would you do if you were Prime Minister to remove people  like that from the country?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, essentially we have to stop the boats. It’s only if we have these illegal boats arriving and this flow  becoming a flood of illegal arrivals that we have these sorts of problems. Now, if we didn’t have the boats,  we wouldn't have this kind of difficulty. Stopping the boats is the key to getting all these other problems  under control.    

 QUESTION:    

 That man's already here though, Mr Abbott. What would you do about, you know, having his claims  assessed?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, obviously he has to be dealt with in accordance with the law. But the fact is if you stop the boats, you  avoid these problems.    

 QUESTION:    

 Is the Curtin Detention Centre fit for children and would the Coalition send kids there?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Again, if you stop the boats you avoid these problems. Now, I regret to say that it’s very difficult to avoid  having women and children in some form of detention if you’ve got illegal arrivals on this scale. The

 Howard Government was able to end the detention of women and children because it stopped the boats. It’s  as simple as that.    

 QUESTION:    

 But if you don’t stop the boats, women and children will still be coming and would you put them in  detention at Curtin Detention Centre?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, as I said, when you’ve got the illegal arrival problem that this government has created…You can say  your piece in a sec, let me say my piece and then you can say yours, sir. If you’ve got the problem that this  government has created, you are obviously going to have a problem of what to do with people who come by  boat; women and children who come by boat. Now, we can’t avoid detention of women and children when  you’ve got the border protection failures of this government.    

 QUESTION:    

 You described the carve up of the GST as small beer. The West Australian Premier and the West Australian  Treasurer say it’s the single biggest issue facing state finances.    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 And look, I applaud the way that Premier Barnett has stood up for Western Australia - I do, I do - and I am  very confident that an incoming Coalition government can do the right thing by the people of Western  Australia by abolishing the carbon tax, by abolishing the mining tax, by instantly restoring or swiftly  restoring the Australian Building and Construction Commission which will make it so much easier to go  ahead with the kind of massive developments that we would like to see here in the west. So, my plan for  Western Australia is abolish the carbon tax, abolish the mining tax and restore the Australian Building and  Construction Commission. This will massively improve the economy of Western Australia.    

 QUESTION:    

 On the GST issue, on state finances, you’re proposing that the big four states get together and talk about it  but you can’t convince Tasmania and South Australia to give up some of their GST money. Why do you  think Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales will give up any of theirs?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, this is an issue for the states. It is an issue for the states.    

 QUESTION:    

 You’ll have no role in trying to solve this issue in the national interest?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I am very keen to see it resolved in the national interest, but it won’t be resolved in the national interest if we  victimise South Australia and Tasmania. Now, I’m very happy to see what the four stronger states can come  up with, but what I would never want to see is anything that disadvantages Tasmania and South Australia.    

 QUESTION:    

 4 

 

 In response to the Grattan Institute findings, do you think that spending on health and welfare at its current  levels are now unsustainable?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 We’ve certainly got a big budgetary problem and we’ve got a budgetary problem because this is a  government which can’t keep its spending under control. They keep saying there’s a revenue problem. Well,  revenues are $70 billion higher now than they were in the last year of the Howard Government. The problem  is that expenditure is some $100 billion higher now than it was then. So, what we need is a government  which gets expenditure under control and one way to get expenditure under control is to stop the boats,  because that's $6.5 billion of unnecessary spending, because this government wasn’t able to leave well  enough alone. One of the other budgetary issues that really ought to be highlighted is the sheer dishonesty of  this government’s budget book-keeping. Believe it or not, they are budgeting $1 billion less for border  protection next year than this year, even though boat arrivals are accelerating, not declining and they have  no plan to reduce them. So, really, this government is incapable of managing money and they’re incapable  of giving us an honest Budget.    

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott you’ve flagged cuts to the public service, you’ve broadly flagged cuts to the public service.  Where else would you be making cuts? Indigenous programmes, perhaps?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I have already flagged a number of specific reductions in unnecessary spending. For instance, we won’t be  continuing the so-called School Kids Bonus. I regret to say we can’t, because it’s a cash splash with  borrowed money that has nothing to do with education. We will be slimming the public service because  there are 20,000 more people on the Commonwealth payroll now than five years ago and I am not sure that  we have had 20,000-commensurate increase in value. So, these are all significant changes that we will make  and of course our version of the National Broadband Network is $60 billion cheaper than Labor’s version  which makes it much more affordable to consumers as well as much more affordable to taxpayers.    

 QUESTION:    

 Can you promise you'd avoid deficits in the next few years?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 What Joe Hockey and I have said all along is that we can’t wave a magic wand and solve all the problems  that this bad government has created overnight, but surpluses are in our DNA. Ten of the last 11 Coalition  budgets were in surplus. Over the life of the Howard Government, surpluses averaged almost one per cent of  GDP. The last Labor surplus was in 1989. That’s how far back you have to go to get a Labor surplus and  under this government there are deficits stretching out as far as the eye can see.    

 QUESTION:    

 Given the state of the budget, can you afford to proceed with the 1.5 per cent cut to the company tax rate?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 This is something that we will be announcing. This is a matter that we will be dealing with in good time  before the next election. We are committed to a modest reduction in company tax. The precise quantum and  the precise timing will be revealed nearer to the election.

 QUESTION:    

 But you’ve added a new tax on business with paid parental leave?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, I concede that we will fund our paid parental leave scheme, we will fund it, and we will fund it with a  modest levy on larger businesses. Many of those larger businesses will actually save some money as well  because many of them already have a form of paid parental leave. But the fundamental point I want to make  about paid parental leave is that this is not just a family policy. This is an economic policy. This is a  productivity policy. This is a participation policy. If we want a more productive economy and if we want to  generate the economic strength that we need in the years ahead we have got to make the most of all of our  economic talent and there are lots of mothers who want to stay in the workforce and this is about enabling  them to do so.     

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott do you know when you will release your IR policy?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, we will obviously release it at a time of our own choosing but I appreciate its importance and I don’t  want the public to be waiting until the last minute for some of our key policies. So, you’ll have to wait and  see and hold your impatience in check for a little while longer.    

 QUESTION:    

 Government sources are putting around a story today that you intend to appoint John Howard as Governor  General after the election and you actually wrote to Ms Gillard in recent days to say that she shouldn’t  appoint a new Governor-General. Is there anything to that at all?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, just on John Howard I have enormous respect for John Howard. As you would expect, I have  enormous respect for John Howard, but he served almost twelve years in a very difficult and demanding job  and I think he is really enjoying his retirement. I am on the record as saying that I think former military  personnel and former judges by and large make the best vice-regal appointments. What I have done is I have  said to the Government that there is no way that a decent, honest government would be making  appointments now to take effect in a years’ time. I mean, there is no way that a government facing an  election should be attempting to manipulate our country from beyond the political grave and that is  effectively what this government risks doing by making appointments now - it has already made several -  making appointments now that don’t start until well into next year. But look, I am not making specific  comment about the Governor -General because the Governor-General, it is a high office, and as far as I am  concerned it should be as free from partisan rancour as is humanly possible.    

 Thank you.
