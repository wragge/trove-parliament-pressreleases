 KEVIN ANDREWS:  

 To other distinguished guests here, ladies and gentlemen, it's a great  pleasure to be here this afternoon for this luncheon. I always feel at home,  even though I don't particularly have, so far as I'm aware, any Italian blood in  my veins. 

 I've always felt at home with people from Italy for a number of occasions and  times in my life in which it's intersected with people of the Italian community  and of an Italian heritage and let me give you an example. 

 When I finished university, I went to work as a judge's associate for just over  two years with one of, I think, the greatest Australians of an Italian  background, namely Sir James Gobbo, who was then a judge of the Victorian  Supreme Court, later Governor of Victoria, who was president of Co.As.It. in  Melbourne and has made a great contribution to Australia. 

 We moved to a suburb of Melbourne where many people were of an Italian  background and, in fact, my eldest daughter went to school with Marco and  Robert Bresciano. Then I was elected to a constituency, many people of  whom were from the Veneto region of Italy.  

 In fact, the Veneto Club in Melbourne is right in the heart of my electorate in  Melbourne. Now, I have a 26 year old daughter who speaks fluent Italian,  who's spent almost two years of her life living in Italy and now teaching Italian  back in Australia. 

 My only regret is she didn't find an eligible young man from Tuscany or  Veneto or Calabria or somewhere. Anyway, it's a great pleasure to be here  with the Italian community in Sydney and particularly to talk about a subject,  which is extremely important to Australia, namely immigration. 

 When I came to this portfolio at the end of January this year, and I wasn't  necessarily expecting to come to this portfolio in this position. The Prime  Minister rings you up one day or one evening and says, I would like you to do  this job and you don't say no, otherwise the offer doesn't come along again, I  think is the past experience. 

 But I came to this portfolio with a great deal of enthusiasm because I believe  that immigration has, and is, very much about nation building in Australia. If  we think about Australia today, we are a nation of immigrants. 

 Leaving aside the original indigenous inhabitants of Australia, all of us who  live in this country can trace back to a point of time, whether it's a few years  ago or a few decades ago or indeed a couple of centuries ago, a person or a  family who made a decision to migrate to Australia. 

 The reality is we are a nation of migrants. When the ABS released their  preliminary data from the 2006 census just a couple of weeks ago, it was  interesting to note that the number of people who were born overseas who  live in Australia today, was about 24 per cent of our population. 

 What's even more interesting than that is that if you go back to the first census  that was taken in Australia, not long after we federated to become the  Commonwealth of Australia, the proportion of people then in the early 1900s  was also about 23 or 24 per cent of the Australian population. 

 In other words, the number of people over the space of a whole century that  have been born overseas and therefore reflecting the immigrant background  of Australia, has hardly changed in the space of 100 years. Indeed, if you  went back to the 1880s, and there wasn't a census taken then. 

 But I suspect if you went back to the 1870s or 80s, the proportion of people  born overseas then would've been even higher, given the gold rushes and the  events of the 1850s and 60s in Australia. 

 I say that because it's just one more piece of data, one more piece of  evidence that illustrates the point that we are indeed a nation of migrants.  Migration has therefore been important in building Australia. We think back to  the great post-war migration, the fact that 6.6 million people have immigrated  to this country over the space of the last 50 or 60 years. 

 That there are 200,000 people of Italian background who today were born in  Italy and if you multiply that by the number who's heritage is in Italy, then  we're talking probably something like a million Australians of Italian  background who live and have contributed and made this country what it is  today. 

 That's the past. That's what's built the great country we live in. That's  contributed to the sense of enthusiasm and nation building, the sense of 

 wanting to get out there and make the best, not just for ourselves and for our  families and communities, but to make this country the great country which it  is. 

 Therefore, I think we can all be proud as Australians of various and different  backgrounds and different nationalities from which we came, that we have  come together in a way which we've built one of the greatest nations in the  world. 

 But our challenge is not the past. Our challenge is the future and immigration  will be equally important in the future of Australia. We face a number of  challenges in the coming years and decades and I want to mention just two  this afternoon. 

 One of them is the challenge of simply being able to compete globally. We live  in the global village. One of the sponsors was mentioned about how you can  move your packages around the world whilst you sleep over night, and  Qantas being another one. 

 The reality is we live in a world in which we trade between nations at a much  greater rate than ever we have in human history. Now, if you look at the trade  between Australia and Italy, you can see that in the last few years in  particular, there's been an increase in that trade two ways between our two  nations. 

 I believe that will continue to grow into the future. The global competition  today is not just in goods and services. The global competition is increasingly  including people themselves. We had a real illustration of that with KPMG and  Matao before, of a young man who's come to Australia and is working in this  country. 

 The reality is we face a shortage of workers in Australia and having lived  through two or three decades of high unemployment, when our challenge was  to find enough jobs for the workers available, it takes a bit of adjusting to this  new era, when we're trying to find enough workers for the jobs that we have. 

 It's a complete 180-degree reversal turnaround in the way in which we must  think about the future, because every developed country, and increasingly  developing countries, are in competition for the same pool of workers. 

 If you narrow that down to the more skilled workers, that it doesn't only include  them, but if you do narrow it down to the more skilled workers, then we in  Australia are competing with Europe and the US and Canada and New  Zealand and other countries around the world, simply to have the people that  we need to ensure that we build a productive nation that our businesses and  our enterprises can continue to thrive into the future. 

 That means we have to have people. The second associated challenge is the  ageing of our population. We have an ageing population because two things  are happening. One is we're living longer, which is a great outcome. And the  other is that we've not been reproducing ourselves for about 40 years. 

 The combination of those factors means year by year, the average age of the  population grows older and that's compounded by a third factor, namely that  the last great demographic shift in Australia was the baby boom from the end  of the Second World War. 

 If you think about it, somebody born in the late 1940s has largely lived through  their working life. If they haven't already moved into retirement, they'll certainly  be thinking of moving into retirement over the next three, four, five, 10 years. 

 So that great population explosion which was the baby boom in the 1950s and  60s is about to become another great population explosion over the next 15  years, namely the retirement boom. If you think about it, if the baby boomers  are going to move out of our workforce, and we haven't been replacing  ourselves in terms of children for the last 40 years almost, then there's going  to be a contraction in the growth of the workforce in Australia. 

 There's only two ways in which we can find population to address that. One is  by natural increase, by increasing the birth rate and the fertility rate but that's  got a whole lot of social and cultural issues surrounding it. 

 Even if we were to reverse the birth rate and bring it back to replacement  levels in the next year or two, it would still take another 25 or 30 years before  we see the impact of that in terms of the workforce in Australia. So that means  that not only is immigration an important factor of the past in Australia,  immigration has to be an important factor of the future in Australia. Because  without people we are not able to build the businesses and the enterprises  that we need in order to continue to thrive in this country.  

 So the great challenge therefore is how we go about this. How do we get the  numbers and the composition of the immigration program right for the future.  Because immigration is not an end in itself. Immigration serves our national  interest and therefore we must be looking to the national interest in terms of  what we do by way of developing the program in the future. 

 We've made some changes over the last ten years to immigration. One is that  we have balanced the program so that we have placed an emphasis on  bringing skilled immigrants and professional immigrants, people that we need  in the workforce into Australia.  

 Indeed if you look at the numbers for the current financial year which were  released recently, we will bring about 102,000 people to Australia this current  financial year as permanent skilled migrants and we will bring about 50,000  under the Family Reunion Program, 85 per cent of whom will be spouses.  

 Indeed there is pressure on that program to increase the numbers because as  more and more young Australians in particular go overseas to study and work  and that tends to be in their 20s when they also tend to enter into  relationships, there is a growing demand on the program for those people who  want to bring their spouses back to Australia and form a family and live here. 

 But what we've maintained, what we've established and indeed maintained, is  a ratio roughly of 2:1 between skilled immigrants and those coming under the 

 Family Reunion Program. We think that that best suits the national interest in  terms of the workforce that we need in Australia. 

 Many of course who come under the Family Reunion Program are indeed  skilled migrants themselves. Something like two-thirds of the spouses work  and about one-third of the total are actually skilled migrants themselves and  so it serves two purposes, if you like, that social purpose. That family purpose  of uniting families, but also an economic and national purpose in terms of  having the workforce to indeed drive Australia forward into the future.  

 Then beyond that we bring about 13,000 humanitarian and refugees to  Australia each year. Both in terms of the actual numbers and certainly on a  per capita basis we are one of the two or three most generous countries in the  world in terms of bringing to this country people who are refugees and/or  humanitarian and migrants and that is something which we will maintain in to  the future. 

 That program alone has to be offset by the number of people actually leave  Australia each year. It may come as a surprise to you, but about 40,000 to  50,000 people permanently depart Australia each year. So the net numbers in  terms of migrants is not the 150,000 or 160,000 that the migrant numbers add  up to. The net migration is about 110,000 people which as the Productivity  Commission and the Treasurer's Intergenerational Report indicated recently is  about the numbers that we believe are optimal in terms of the actual economic  development of Australia into the future. 

 Of course there are shortages from time to time in particular industries and  particular sectors of the economy. That's why we have temporary skilled  migration programs. The so-called 457 Visa Program, for example which is -  had a bit of attention recently for reasons other than what it was put in place  for. 

 But we currently bring about 70,000 people to Australia under the Temporary  Skilled Migration Program. People who come here because of their skills and  because of a shortage in Australia for a period of up to four years.  Interestingly, about 20 per cent of those people actually convert that  temporary migration to Australia into permanent migration to Australia. That is  they become permanent migrants, permanent residents and ultimately we  hope citizens of Australia. 

 Then on top of that we have groups like international students who add about  $10 billion dollars to the Australian economy each year and are therefore an  important component of the Australian economy, let alone the millions of  tourists who come to Australia each year and are a very important component  of our economy as well. 

 So that gives you a sense, if you like, of the numbers and the composition of  the program and as I said, the important thing is how we balance this into the  future.  

 You know, there is demand in certain areas to bring more people in. A lot of  people would like to bring their ageing and elderly parents to Australia. But we  have taken a decision to cap that program and maintain those ratios so the 

 program is aimed at bringing people who contribute to the economy  predominantly to the country while still maintaining some who come under  other circumstances. 

 How we get this balance right into the future, I believe is going to be quite  important. 

 Karen spoke about a few changes that we are making to the legislation.  Particularly in relation to a couple of things. One is that we are increasing the  English language requirements in relation to a number of temporary visa  holders and indeed students. One of the reasons we are doing that is  because of the feedback from the business community saying that the level of  English we require is actually higher than we have had in the past.  

 We need people to be able to speak and understand and communicate  sufficiently in English that they can understand, for example, their  occupational health and safety requirements in the workplace or in relation to  students who were finding that employers were saying that when students  from overseas came out of university here and sought to work in Australia,  many of them did not have the requisite level of English that enabled them to  actually function in a workplace in Australia. 

 So we are trying to make some careful adjustments so that we still have the  advantage of bringing people here, but ensuring that when they are here, they  can actually perform what they wish to do as well. 

 Mention was also made of compliance and the unfortunate reality is that there  are a few people out there, unfortunately very few, who nonetheless give  migration programs a bad name by doing the wrong thing.  

 What I have sought to do is put in place some penalties that will deal with the  cowboys out there. But at the same time trying to streamline the system so  that where the sponsors of temporary visitors, temporary skilled migrants from  overseas, where those sponsors have got a good reputation have done the  right thing, we actually streamline the process and make it easier for them, but  at the same time jump on those people that have done the wrong thing. 

 Because the danger with immigration always is that if there is a perception  that builds in the community that somehow this is not in the national interest  for Australia, that somehow it has been rorted or that it is displacing  Australians from jobs or it is driving down wages in Australia. Then if that  perception grows then of course the danger is that the whole program itself  can fall in to disrepute so far as the general populous in the country is  concerned.  

 If that was to happen that would be a major negative so far as our economic  development in the future is concerned. 

 So we have to be careful to ensure that if people do the wrong thing we can  jump on them. At the same time maintaining the integrity and therefore the  public confidence in the migration program in the future. 

 I said that the Migration Program has to act in the national interest. As you  know and I think someone was alluding to I might speak about a matter of  topical interest at the present time. Can I simply say about that matter that I  actually cancel visas on character grounds every day of the year and it is  because people have done the wrong thing who shouldn't have done the  wrong thing in Australia. 

 It has got nothing to do with race or nationality or religion nor any other criteria  such as that. It is simply a question of whether or not somebody has acted in  a way which is unlawful or inappropriate in Australia and again to maintain the  integrity of a program, I think we have to do that. Because otherwise we are  not serving the national interest so far as the program is concerned. 

 Can I just mention one other matter before I finish and that is in relation to  citizenship. 

 I said that millions of people have come to Australia. When we invite people to  Australia, whether they are skilled migrants or under the Family Reunion  Program or as refugees, what we are doing in Australia is inviting them to  become fully a member of the Australian community.  

 We don't have first and second and third class people in Australia. We invite  people to become equal with us as citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia.  

 One of the changes we made recently was to rename this portfolio from  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to Immigration and Citizenship. Not to  deny the multicultural nature or fact of life in Australia, but to place some more  emphasis on citizenship.  

 We are proposing and indeed we have legislation in the parliament to  introduce a new citizenship test. The reason for this is because we believe  that where we are drawing people now from so many different cultures around  the world and so many different nations, that there is an expectation that  people ought to understand something about the heritage and the values and  the history of Australia. 

 If you think about the Great Post War Migration Program. Even though people  came from Italy and Greece and the Netherlands and the UK and New  Zealand, as the major countries that people migrated to Australia from, all of  those countries shared broadly the same cultural values. We might have  eaten different food, we might have spoken different languages, we might  have had different styles in certain ways, but we all shared the same what I  would broadly call western liberal democratic traditions. 

 Now that is not to say that other traditions are right or wrong or better or  worse, but the reality today is that we draw people to Australia from over 200  different countries around the world. Some of whom share the same western  liberal democratic tradition and some of whom come from nations where there  are different cultural values and different traditions in place.  

 I believe, and I think the Australian people believe, that when you come to  Australia you come to share broadly the cultural traditions that we have in  Australia. 

 The great achievement of Australia, I believe, is that we have balanced two  things very well. We have balanced diversity and integration. We celebrate  diversity in Australia. You only have to walk down the streets of Sydney or  Melbourne or indeed a country town in Victoria or New South Wales or  Queensland to recognise the diversity that we have in Australia.  

 Matao spoke about it. About the multicultural nature of Australia is a contrast  to Milan. That is one of the great achievements of Australia.  

 But balanced out against that has been the achievement of integrating us  together and so that we are all Australians. We are Australians of Italian  background or Greek background or English background or native Australian  background or whatever. But we are Australians. 

 I think that our achievement in balancing diversity in integration has been one  of the strengths of the nation of Australia, particularly over the last 50 or 60  years.  

 So when we bring people from so many different cultures and backgrounds, I  think we have a responsibility actually to say to them well these are the values  that we share in Australia. Those values are hardly controversial. They are  things like respect for the rule of law, support for a parliamentary democracy,  the equality of men and women, the freedom of association, the freedom of  speech, the freedom of religion. Things which I do not think are very  controversial, which we would all say if we thought about it.  

 These are the underlying, the under-pinning values of what it is to be an  Australian and what it is to be part of Australia today.  

 So the citizenship test will simply be doing that. The test itself is not the  important thing. It is the passing of information, hopefully, to people to say  look this is what we believe in Australia and you are free to practice your  religion. You are free to continue to have your own cultural traditions from the  country you come from. You are free to do all of that but we also integrate at a  level as well. 

 That is why we are introducing the test. I believe it is important in this new  century in which we live in much more of a global village, which is good for us  in many ways, but also has dangers as we have seen over the last few weeks  in Australia. 

 Thank you for the invitation to be here. As I said it is always a personal delight  to be amongst Australians of Italian background. Can I say to you that I could  hardly resist not speaking something topically, politically to a business group,  given a certain event that is going to occur in the next few months in Australia.  

 I think from a business perspective that what we have in Australia today is  probably a golden age so far as the economy is concerned. We have got the  lowest unemployment that we have seen for over three decades. We have got  more people in work in Australia than ever before. We have seen over  300,000 jobs created in Australia in the last 12 months at a time when  economists and commentators were saying that they expected that there  would be some easing so far as employment is concerned.  

 We have got relatively acceptable levels of inflation. Interest rates are in a  region which are a long way from what they were 15 or 20 years ago.  Basically every piece of economic data says that Australia is enjoying  wonderful prosperity at the present time. 

 I just want to say two things about that in a political context. One is, it didn't  happen by accident. We are the stand out economy in the world so far as that  is concerned. It has been through discipline and careful management on the  federal government level of paying off debt, of making sure as a federal  government we live within our means. That we didn't just keep on borrowing.  That we built up surpluses that our financial standing was such that we have  been able to operate through crises such as the Asian Financial Crisis and the  worst drought that we have had in this country for at least a century. That's  good management, at a political level, at the national level in Australia.  

 And the question, therefore, for the future is, not that this is just going to  automatically continue, cause it didn't happen automatically, it happened  through hard work. The question for the future is, which party and which group  are more capable of maintaining that prosperity into the future.  

 It won't come as a surprise to you that I say that the current government is the  best group to do that, but I don't say it simply because I'm a member of the  current government. I'm saying it because we've got very good evidence and  a very good background to support that.  

 And the undoing of the industrial relations changes an a whole range of other  things would send Australia on a path, not just the nation but indeed all your  businesses, that would find a much more difficult circumstances in the future  than we've got at the present time.  

 I won't say anything more about it, it's an important choice in a few weeks'  time, or a few months' time in Australia. It's a choice which I believe, you know  the best one would be to re-elect the government, but all Australians will have  a say in that in the future.  

 Thank you, again, for being here. 

 [Applause] 

 FACILITATOR:  

 Minister, thank you very much for your address. It's been very enlightening  and, again, on behalf of everyone here I would like to say thank you. And you  we have question scheduled, I invite you to ask the question, because the  Minister is just arriving. Thank you.  

 [General talking] 

 KEVIN ANDREWS:  

 Yes, right down the back. Yes ma'am?  

 QUESTION:  

 [Inaudible] 

 FACILITATOR:  

 Thank you very much. Otherwise we won't have time. We take another  question. Soâ€¦  

 QUESTION:  

 [Inaudible]  

 FACILITATOR:  

 Thank you, we may take another question.  

 KEVIN ANDREWS:  

 Can I just say; I just couldn't hear the question from here. And, if you'd like to  see me afterwards I'm happy to answer the question.  

 FACILITATOR:  

 Because we couldn't hear at all.  

 KEVIN ANDREWS:  

 We - no. Any other question? Yes, yes sir.  

 QUESTION:  

 You mentioned the net figure of 110,000 people, and you talked about the -  the retirement boom. Is 110,000 net the right figure? Would a bigger figure be  more appropriate as time goes by?  

 KEVIN ANDREWS:  

 We actually set the figure on a yearly basis, so just a couple of months ago  we determined what the figure would be for next year. And in setting that we  set not just the total figure, but what the component of each of the three parts,  the skill part, the family reunion part, and the refugee and humanitarian part is.  So there's no figure which is set for the following financial year, or the one  after that. I mean some people argue you ought to have a long-term aspiration  in this regard, but we actually set it on a year by year basis, so if  circumstances change that means you can actually vary the number of people  who come to Australia.  

 If there were more people stay here, or more people leave, or there's an  economic upturn or downturn you can therefore vary it according to the  circumstances.  

 Yes, down the back, you'll have to speak up, sir. It reminds me, I was at a  country hall in outback New South Wales a little while ago, and the  microphone was on the blink, and I said 'can you hear me down the back' in 

 this old corrugated iron shed. And a voice from down the back said, 'Ah, yes I  can, mate, but I'm happy to swap with someone who can't.' 

 [Laughter] 

 QUESTION:  

 Minister, you said that there were two ways in which our labour force could  increase. One of them was by natural increase in population, and the other  was by immigration. There is, in fact, a third one. And that is to persuade  people to stay in the labour force longer. What are you doing about that?  

 KEVIN ANDREWS:  

 That, indeed, is a valid point. There's a practice, I suppose, in Australia that's  grown up over a number of years, if not decades, that an ideal or desirable  retirement age is in the mid-50s, rather than later than that. One of the  consequences of the aging of the population, not in 10, or 15, or 20 years but  more immediately than that, in three to five years, as the baby-boomers move  out of the workforce, is this contraction in the size of the workforce.  

 And, for example, in my last portfolio, in Workplace Relations, we had some  research done on this, and what it indicated - and this is research was now  two years ago so we're talking about just three years' time - that over a period  of five years there would be up to 195,000 less people of working age in the  workforce than there would have been had the population not been aging.  

 So, one of the ways you can try and ameliorate that, which is to come to your  point, is to try and encourage people to stay on in the workforce to an older  age. And in saying that, I don't mean work 'til you drop. If we could encourage  people to retire in their early 60s, rather then in their mid-50s, on average, that  would ameliorate that aging of the population at least over the next, perhaps,  five or ten years.  

 So, we've put some measures in place to do that. For example, if people  qualify for the pension and don't take it, they delay it; they get a bonus when  they do take it. The superannuation changes which came into operation from  the beginning of July, which changed the tax arrangements post-60, which are  really aimed at this demographic change. Because the thrust of those  changes is to actually encourage people to stay in the workforce until they're  60, rather than retiring at 55 or 58, or so forth.  

 Now it may well be that we need to do other things in the future, depending on  what happens, but those sorts of policies, I think, are important. Take an  example where I think something does need to be done. I'm not sure about  New South Wales, but in Victoria where I'm from, schoolteachers general  retire at the age of 54 years and 11 months, or nine months. Why? Because  once they reach 55 their retirement income actually goes backwards for the  next seven or eight years.  

 So someone who might be in the prime of their working life, you know a  principal or a deputy principal, or a senior teacher at a school will invariably  choose to retire before they're 55, even though they're quite happy to work on 

 to 58 or 60. Because until they - unless they work to 62 or 63 they're actually  no better, in fact worse off, if they don't retire before the age of 55. Now that's  just a total loss of talent and experience and expertise that we actually need in  the workforce.  

 And those are the sort of hurdles and barriers we've got to overcome to  encourage people to stay on a bit longer. Yes, we'll take one more.  

 QUESTION:  

 Minister, I, like you, support the Section 457 visas, but most of the GSP, the  Gross State Product, that's peaking at the moment are in places like Western  Australia and Northern Territory. Is the government going to do anything about  helping Section 457 visas and prioritising them to these other regions, where  there's high growth at the moment?  

 KEVIN ANDREWS:  

 Well, we don't actually prioritise where 457 visa-holders go. It's very much a  demand driven visa category. But the two largest users of 457 visas in  Australia are the governments of New South Wales and Queensland.  Particularly in areas such as health, doctors - which has been topical recently  - and nurses. The New South Wales health system uses a lot of 457 visas to  bring people in to actually staff the health system in New South Wales, as  does the health system in Queensland.  

 So it's a program which is largely driven by the demand in particular areas.  Now, yes it's true that in Western Australia, given the state of the economy  and the boom in the mineral industry in Western Australia, that that's sucking  workers from all other parts of Australia and creating demand for 457 visa-holders, but also creating demand elsewhere in Australia. As is Queensland to  a large extent at the present time. 

 But if a business can demonstrate a need for a 457 worker, that is that they  can't find a worker in Australia in that skilled occupation, then it's open for  them to sponsor people under the 457 visa program.  

 FACILITATOR:  

 Minister. Huge round of applause for Minister Andrews. Thank you. And now  enjoy your main course.
