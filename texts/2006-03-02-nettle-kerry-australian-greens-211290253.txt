 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 Immigration Senate Inquiry reveals deeply flawed system 

 2nd Mar 06 

 

 Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today called on the  Government to implement the recommendations of the Senate  Inquiry into the Migration Act tabled today, and seriously consider  abandoning the policy of mandatory detention.   

 Senator Nettle sat on the Inquiry, attended all hearings and has  signed onto the report with additional comments.   

 "The message from the Inquiry is clear. The policy of mandatory  detention is deeply flawed and should be abolished," said Senator  Nettle.   

 "The Inquiry found the immigration system is inconsistent and  treats people without humanity - the system is broken.   

 "Witness after witness talked about the culture of hostility and  suspicion toward asylum seekers. Ministerâ€™s Howard, Ruddock and  Vanstone are directly responsible for this culture, and cultural  change must be led by the Government.   

 "The evidence provided to the Inquiry was extremely damning of  the policy of mandatory detention. Families have been living in the  community for some time now and sky has not fallen in. This policy  should be adopted for all asylum seekers so they can live in the  community while their claims for asylum are assessed.   

 "The Government should adopt the recommendation for a separate  complementary protection stream for those people who require  protection but do not fit the strict definition of a refugee. At the  moment these people fall through the cracks.   

 "The Government should put party politics aside and implement the  recommendations of this Inquiry. Australians do not want any more  immigration scandals.   

 "The Government could start reform by ensuring that Cornelia Rau  is properly compensated for her awful ordeal by the end of this 

 month."
