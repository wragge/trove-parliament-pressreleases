  DISPLACED FAMILI  ES FACE STARVATION,   
HOMELESSNESS…. IN AUSTRALIA

  

  A number of people in the process of claiming refugee status are at 
immediate risk of homelessness and starvation in Brisbane, with their 
last means of support running out yesterday.

  

  The people at risk incl ude 3 families — two from Africa and 
one from the Middle East - who among them have 6 children between the 
ages of 2 and 18.

  

 Even though they have been in Australia for between 
one and two years, they are not allowed to work or gain access to health 
care while awaiting the result of their refugee application.

  

 The only basic level support they have been receiving 
is from refugee funds established by the likes of American rock star 
Bruce Springsteen and Australia’s Sisters of Mercy — and that money 
ran out yesterday.

  

 Federal Shadow Minister for Immigration, Con Sciacca 
today said that this situation was the result of the Howard Government’s 
cruel stance on the plight of often-genuine displaced and persecuted 
people from other countries.

  

 “If we are not careful our much cherished international 
reputation as a leading and compassionate, humanitarian nation could 
be at risk, particularly given that the eyes of the World are presently 
upon us with the 2000 Olympic Games approaching,” Mr Sciacca said.

  

 “Whether they are refugees or not, it is not the 
Australian way to allow human beings to suffer; especially children 
— it is simply immoral!

  

 “This Howard Federal Government is the most mean-spirited 
Government Australia has seen since Federation,” Mr Sciacca said.

  

 “In July 1998, the Government, by regulation, ruled 
that while refugees wait for their applications to be processed, they 
are not allowed to earn enough simply to survive, or receive even the 
most basic health care.

  

 “These people are in Australia legally under international 
conventions and yet we don’t allow them to work, even to earn enough 
to put food on the table and a roof over their head.

  

 “When the last dollar of the last payment runs out, 
these families and their children could well be on the street,” Mr 
Sciacca said.
