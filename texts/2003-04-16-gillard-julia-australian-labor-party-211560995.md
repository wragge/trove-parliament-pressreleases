 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration   

 DEAR MINISTER: HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THE 126  IRAQIS IN THE PACIFIC SOLUTION?   

 During recent talks in Iraq to form an interim administration, a clear message was given to the  Australian representatives by some Iraqi leaders who hit out at the detention of Iraqi asylum  seekers by the Australian Government.     

 In response to this criticism, Minister Ruddock stated that currently only 39 Iraqis are held in  detention by the Howard Government.   In fact, the Minister dismissed the criticism by  saying:   

 I think it demonstrates a misunderstanding of the situation   

 and he offered to provide more information on the situation.    

 Perhaps it is the Minister who is demonstrating a misunderstanding of the situation and is in  need of further information.   

 He seems to have completely forgotten the 126 Iraqi people still being held under the so-called Pacific Solution.  What is Minister Ruddock planning for this group of Iraqis?  To  simply forget about them?     

 One of the Howard Government’s justifications for Australia’s involvement in the war in Iraq  was its professed concern for the Iraqi people.  Minister Ruddock, you can’t demonstrate  concern by forgetting people exist.
