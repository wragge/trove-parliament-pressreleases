 Border Control Pays: Australia to accept more Refugees

 VPS 056/2004

 Today I am announcing the ultimate dividend on strong border control. In 2004-05 we will have a 50 percent increase  in our refugee intake. The refugee intake will shift from is current level of 4 000 places to 6 000 in 2004-05. 

 Australia's humanitarian program has been at 12 000 places per annum for the past seven years, this 12 000 has been  made up of 4 000 refugee places and 8 000 Special Humanitarian places (SHP).

 In my recent consultations on the Humanitarian Program, many refugee assistance groups recommended both an  increase in the program and a rebalancing within it towards more refugee places.

 The 2 000 extra refugee places will be made up of a 1 000 place increase in the total Humanitarian Program (a shift  from 12 000 to 13 000) and a shift of 1 000 places from the SHP component to the refugee component of the  program.

 This increase is only possible because of the success we have achieved in dramatically reducing the number of illegal  arrivals. The unquestionable success of offshore processing, returning boats and our coordinated border control has  made the people smuggling business much less attractive.

 With a strong economy and strong border control, Australia can now welcome those most in need through the front  door. People in refugee camps who cannot return home and cannot afford a people smuggler need a lasting solution.  Resettlement is the only option. 

 I would like to express my gratitude to those Non Government Organisations who have been involved in the  consultation process on the humanitarian program. These organisations understand that if there is to be an  international solution, decisions need to be made as to who is a refugee and who is not. International cooperation will  always play a key role assisting those most in need.

 In the last 10 years Australia has resettled more than 100 000 people and since 1945 we have resettled over 620 000  people. Our program is the third largest dedicated resettlement program in the world. Australia has a proud tradition  of helping those most in need.

 Our regional priority will continue to be in Africa, followed by the Middle East and South West Asia - this reflects  the resettlement priorities of the UNHCR.
