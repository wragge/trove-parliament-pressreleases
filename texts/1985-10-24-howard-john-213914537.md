 "THE FOREIGN POLICY OF THE HAWKE GOVERNMENT -  AN  

 UNBALANCED APPROACH"

 Parliament House. Canberra, A.C.T. 2(500 Phone 726994

 B e f o r e d e p a r t in g  for CHOGM, Mr Hawke was in t e r v ie w e d  

 b y  BBC RADIO.

 I n t h i s  in t e r v ie w , t h e  Pr im e  Min is t e r  s e t  o u t to c l a r if y

 WHAT HE WANTED CHOGM TO ACHIEVE CONCERNING SOUTH AFRICA. 

 I n PARTICULAR HE CALLED FOR MANDATORY ECONOMIC SANCTIONS 

 AND INDICATED H IS BELIEF THAT!

 " . . . IT  W ILL BE THE FIRM VIEW OF THE 

 OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THOSE 

 REPRESENTED (AT CHOGM) . . .  THAT WE 

 ARE HERE DEALING WITH ISSUES WHICH 

 TRANSCEND AN ASSESSMENT OF A COMMERCIAL 

 BALANCE SHEET."

 Mr Haw ke a l s o  found t im e  d u r in g  th e BBC in t e r v ie w  to

 ISSUE YET ANOTHER GRATUITOUS INSULT -  TH IS TIME TO

 t h e  T h a t c h e r  Go v e r n m e n t.

 Our Pr im e  Mi n is t e r  d e c l a r e d  t h a t :

 " B r i t a i n  m ay h a v e to come to t h e  r e a l is a t io n

 THAT WE LIV E  IN 1985; BRITANNIA NO LONGER 

 RULES THE WORLD."

 NOW THAT CHOGM IS  OVER AT LEAST TWO THINGS REMAIN 

 q u it e  c l e a r . I t i s  s t i l l  1985. And Br it a n n ia  s t i l l

 NO LONGER RULES THE WORLD.

 BASIC COMMITMENT TO BRING ABOUT ECONOMIC SANCTIONS.

 Ac c o r d in g  to Mr Ha w k e,  Commonw ealth s a n c t io n s  are

 S T IL L  A P O S S IB IL IT Y  AND MAY RESULT FROM THE COMMITTEE 

 OF THE SEVEN HEADS OF GOVERNMENT THAT W ILL MEET IN 

 S IX  MONTHS TIME TO REVIEW THE SITUATION.

 IN THE MEANTIME THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS  CONSIDERING. 

 ITS OWN UNILATERAL SANCTIONS -  INCLUDING BANS ON NEW 

 INVESTMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA, AIR LINKS AND THE IMPORT 

 OF AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS. ·

 T h is  i s  in  s p it e  of t h e Ca b in e t  d e c is io n  of o n l y two

 MONTHS AGO THAT UNILATERAL SANCTIONS ARE "INADEQUATE".

 Ac c o r d in g  t o  M r Hawke " we a r e l i v i n g  in  an a c c e l e r a t in g

 SITU ATIO N " AND, AS A RESULT, MANDATORY ECONOMIC 

 SANCTIONS MIGHT t i t  A C H ltV A tiL t IN  S IX  MONTHS T IM E .

 ON ANY ANALYSIS, MR HAWKE AND MR HAYDEN HAVE BECOME 

 OBSESSED WITH SOUTH AFRICA.

 I n THE PROCESS THE ATTITUDE OF THE ALP TO CHOGM HAS 

 CHANGED DRAMATICALLY.

 3 .

 Wh en CHOGM was h e l d  i n  Melbo ur n e i n  l a t e  1981 t h e 

 t h e n  L e a d e r  o f t h e  La bo r Pa r t y , Mr B i l l  Ha y d e n ,

 DESCRIBED IT  AS "AN EXTRAVAGANT INDULGENCE OF LIT T LE  

 RELEVANCE TO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS OR AUSTRALIA'S 

 ROLE IN  THE WORLD".

 Bu t now a l l  t h i s  h as c h a n g e d . The w hole d ir e c t io n

 t o  g e t a l l  t h e  Commonw ealth l e a d e r s  in t o  l i n e  over

 APPLYING MANDATORY ECONOMIC SANCTIONS TO SOUTH AFRICA.

 I n MY VIEW T H IS .IS  A MISPLACED EMPHASIS.

 I AM TOTALLY UNCONVINCED THAT SOUTH AFRICA SHOULD 

 BECOME THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY OF AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN 

 POLICY.

 BECAUSE THEY DENIGRATE THE HUMAN S P IR IT . MOREOVER, 

 APARTHEID ALSO INVOLVES A LEVEL OF STATE INTERVENTION 

 IN THE ECONOMY AND IN THE LIVES OF INDIVIDUALS THAT IS 

 COMPLETELY AT ODDS WITH LIBERAL PRINCIPLES. IT  IS  NOT 

 SURPRISING THEN, THAT SOME OF THE KEY WHITE SOUTH AFRICAN 

 C R ITIC S OF THEIR COUNTRY'S APARTHEID POLICIES ARE 

 BUSINESS LEADERS.

 On 19 Au g u st 1985 t h e Co a l i t i o n  c a l l e d  on th e South 

 A f r ic a n  Go v e r n m e n t to m ake Î» s p e c if ic  c o m m it m e n t for

 THE REFORM OF ITS INTERNAL POLICIES IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER 

 . AN END TO THE STATE OF EMERGENCY;

 . AN END TO DETENTION WITHOUT TR IA L;

 . THE UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF PO LITIC AL LEADERS;

 . THE PROGRESSIVE ABOLITION OF THE PASS LAWS/

 t h e  Group A r ea s Ac t , and o ther forms of

 DISCRIMINATORY LEGISLATION;

 . A COMMITMENT TO A COMMON FORM OF CITIZEN SH IP

 for a l l  So u th A f r ic a n s ;

 . AN END TO FORCED REMOVALS;

 . EQUALITY OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY.

 The Co a l i t i o n  b e l ie v e s  t h a t  o p p o s it io n  to a p a r t h e id

 DOES NOT REQUIRE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS.

 I n MY VIEW ANY SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION OF MANDATORY 

 ECONOMIC SANCTIONS WOULD HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE 

 OF MAKING THE SITUATION IN SOUTH AFRICA WORSE -  

 ESPECIALLY FOR THE BLACKS.

 5 .

 Ac c o r d in g  t o  Z im ba b w e l e a d e r , Mr Ro b e r t Mu g a b e ,  s a n c t io n s

 ALONE ARE NOT ENOUGH. MR MUGABE HAS CALLED FOR AN 

 "ARMED STRUGGLE FOR LIBERATION" IN SOUTH AFRICA.

 I n OTHER WORDS, SANCTIONS SHOULD BE SEEN AS COMPLEMENTARY 

 TO ARMED VIOLENCE.

 I FIND CALLS FOR ARMED INSURRECTION AT THE LEAST GRAVELY 

 DISTURBING AND AT WORSE LIKELY TO PRODUCE AN OUTCOME

 A l a n  Pa t o n  h as o p p o s e d d is in v e s t m e n t  by We s t e r n  n a t io n s

 BECAUSE HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT:

 " . . . DAMAGING OUR ECONOMY W ILL HELP US

 ONLY ON THE WHITE ELECTORATE OF SOUTH

 TRAGIC COUNTRY,

 INCREASING DIALOGUE (LEADING TO PO LITIC AL DECISIONS) 

 BETWEEN WHITE LIBERALS, BLACK MODERATES AND THE 

 LEADERSHIP OF SOUTH AFR IC A'S LARGEST RACIAL GROUP -t h e  Z u l u s , ,

 I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO 

 DESTROY THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE WHOLE OF 

 CONTINENTAL AFRICA W ILL DO ANYONE ANY GOOD -  

 LEAST OF ALL THE BLACKS BOTH WITHIN SOUTH AFRICA 

 AND IN THOSE AFRICAN NATIONS THAT TRADE WITH IT .

 IN HIS RECENT ADDRESS TO THE UNITED NATIONS MR HAYDEN 

 SPELT OUT THE PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS 

 ARGUMENT.

 Ac c o r d in g  Ï Î¿  t h e  Fo r e ig n  Min is t e r  t h e r e  " i s  a  r e a l

 AS WELL THERE IS A LINGERING FEAR THAT HANOI MIGHT 

 DECIDE TO SUPPORT A GUERILLA INSURGENCY INSIDE 

 THAILAND.

 11.

 I t i s  es tim a te d that there have been OVER 80 

 V ietnam ese in c u r sio n s in t o  Th a ila n d s in c e 

 November 1984.

 "  i  \  '  ' ' : ‘ . "  t  '  v t  * *  , , *  . '

 As well there is  evid en c e that the Phnom Penh 

 government is  u s in g  forced labour to clear the 

 ju n g les,  b u il d  roads and defence works along the

 THAI BORDER IN ORDER TO PREVENT KHMERS FLEEING 

 FROM THEIR SELF-PROCLAIMED HANOI-BACKED LIBERATORS.

 THE EVER-INCREASING VIETNAMESE M ILITA R Y BUILD-UP 

 ON THE THAI BORDER IS  A MATTER FOR DEEP CONCERN

 Ï Î¿  T h a il a n d  a n d it s  ASEAN n e ig h b o u r s .

 the Th a i Fo r eig n Min is t e r , Air  Ch ie f  Marshal Si d d h i. 1 â   / , ' ' ' i- . - - ' : .

 I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE THAIS ARE DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED 

 WITH THE WAY IN WHICH Mr HAYDEN HAS RESPONDED TO THE 

 VIETNAMESE OCCUPATION OF KAMPUCHEA.

 The Hawke Government is  far too sym pa th etic to Hanoi

 AND FAR TOO DISMISSIVE OF THE GENUINE CONCERNS OF

 Th a il a n d .

 At the very least Au s t r a l ia should be g iv in g

 DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT TO THE THAIS.

 12.

 But instead Mr Hayden has elected to bend over

 BACKWARDS TO ACCOMMODATE VIETNAM.

 Au s t r a l ia' s r ela tio n sh ip w ith Thailand is  d eterio rating. 

 I t ought to be improved.

 I t is  somewhat unfashionable to recall that the 

 Khmer Rouge vic to r y in  1975 was w idely supported 

 by le ft- wing movements throughout the world.

 Nevertheless i t  is  t im e l y to remind those who today

 SEEK TO JUSTIFY VIETNAMESE AGGRESSION IN KAMPUCHEA,

 ON THE BASIS THAT HANOI PUT POL POT TO FLIGHT, OF 

 THIS CENTRAL FACT.

 Cer ta in ly V ietnamese troops removed Pol Po t. But 

 without Ha n o i' s support the Khmer Rouge would not

 HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH ITS KILLING FIELDS IN 

 Ap r il  1975.

 I n my view  the Hawke Government has an abysmal 

 record in  Foreign Af f a ir s .

 Already the Hawke Government has two strikes against 

 it  on the American Alliance -  the cornerstone of 

 Au s t r a l ia' s defence arrangements.

 13.

 The Pr im e  Min is t e r  caved- in  to the So c ia l is t  Lett

 WHEN HE REFUSED TO ALLOW UNITED STATES PLANES 

 MONITORING AN UNARMED MX M IS S ILE  SPLASH-DOWN TO _

 BE SERVICED FROM AUSTRALIAN A IR F IE LD S .

 Also the Hawke Government has e f f e c t iv e l y  l in e d  up 

 w it h  the So v ie t  Un io n a g a in st the Un it e d  Sta tes on 

 Pr e s id e n t Reagan' s Str a teg ic defence i n i t i a t i v e .

 Th is  is  in  s p it e  of the fact that i f  the opponents

 OF THE SDI HAVE THEIR WAY THE USSR W ILL HAVE AN 

 ABSOLUTE MONOPOLY ON A N T I-M IS S IL E  DEFENCE SYSTEMS.

 The So v ie t  Un io n already has an awesome s u p e r io r it y

 IN LONG RANGE, LAND-BASED NUCLEAR M IS SILES AS WELL 

 AS IN CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS.

 IF  THE USSR OBTAINS A MONOPOLY IN STRATEGIC DEFENCE 

 SYSTEMS, THE VERY FUTURE OF WESTERN DEMOCRACIES W ILL 

 BE THREATENED.

 TH IS  WOULD CERTAINLY NOT ASSIST THE CAUSE OF PEACE.

 14.

 I t should be remembered that the Hawke Government

 ALSO REFUSED TO PROVIDE DRY DOCKING F A C IL IT IE S

 ÏÎ¿  the HMS I n v in c ib l e . More recently i t  has a d vised 

 the Reagan a d m in is t r a t io n  that the US Navy should 

 scale down it s  v i s i t s  to Western Au str a lia n ports -  

 in  s p it e  of the fact that they pro vide the most 

 s u it a b l e port of call for U. S.  s h ip s  o perating in  

 the I n d ia n Ocean.

 All these developments have taken place at a t im e  

 when there is  clear evid en c e of a su b sta n tia l b u il d - up 

 of So v ie t  m il it a r y  power in  the Pa c if ic  and I ndian 

 Oceans and the South Ch in a  Se a .

 I n the ten years s in c e the fall of Sa ig o n, pro-S o v ie t 

 forces have come to power in  Laos, Cam bodia, 

 Mo zam biq ue, Angola, South Yemen, Nicaragua,

 Afg h anistan and Et h io p ia . -

 I n Afg h a n ista n, 1 0 0 ,0 0 0  So v ie t  troops are l it e r a ll y 

 p u t t in g  the local population to the sword by x 

 conducting a war of staggering b r u t a l it y and 

 o p p r e s s io n.

 According to reports, Afghanistan has lost almost 

 a quarter of it s  population ( through death or 

 refugee outflow) s in c e the So v ie t  in v a s io n . There

 HAS BEEN WIDESPREAD P O L ltlC A L  AND CULTURAL REPRESSION.

 Po l it ic a l  prisoners are tortured. W ar has been waged

 ON C IV IL IA N  SETTLEMENTS.

 15.

 Under th e terms of the Treaty of Fr ie n d s h ip  between 

 Moscow, and Ha n o i, the So v ie t  Un io n has access to 

 the V ietn a m ese m il it a r y  bases at Da Nang and 

 Cam Ranh Ba y .

 Cam Ranh Bay is  now the largest So v ie t  naval base

 OUTSIDE OF THE WARSAW PACT COUNTRIES.

 IN OTHER WORDS, THE SOVIET UNION IS RAPIDLY BECOMING 

 THE PREPONDERANT MILITARY POWER IN OUR REGION.

 THE DETERIORATING POLITICAL SITUATION IN THE 

 Ph il ip p in e s  at the very least r a is e s a q u estio n 

 MARK OVER THE FUTURE OF THE U. S.  CLARKE AIR BASE

 and Su b ic  Bay Naval Ba s e .

 And ye t these two Un it e d  States bases offer the

 ONLY EFFECTIVE COUNTER TO THE SOVIET BUILD-UP IN 

 OUR REGION.

 Moreover, the p o l it ic a l  in s t a b il it y  in  South Afr ic a

 MUST PLACE IN DOUBT THE OPERATIONAL FUTURE OF THE

 Simonstown Naval Ba s e .

 I f the So v ie t  Un io n were to acquire naval f a c il it ie s  

 at S imonstown -  following a total p o l it ic a l  breakdown 

 in  South Af r ic a  -  the m il it a r y  and str a teg ic s it u a t io n

 IN OUR REGION WOULD DETERIORATE DRAMATICALLY.

 16.

 I n t h is  context i t  should be remembered that not

 LONG AFTER THE FALL OF SOUTH VIETNAM, THE USSR 

 TOOK OVER THE AIR AND NAVAL FACILITIES AT DA NANG

 and Cam Ranh Ba y .

 Ten years ago many Fo r e ig n Af f a ir s  commentators

 TOLD US THAT THE USSR WOULD NOT OBTAIN THESE 

 MILITARY PRIZES. BUT THEY WERE PROVEN WRONG.

 AS A RESULT THE SOVIET UNION HAS BEEN ABLE TO 

 MASSIVELY INCREASE ITS MILITARY PRESENCE IN OUR 

 REGION.

 Rec e n tly the e f f e c t iv e n e s s  of the Un it e d  States

 NAVAL OPERATIONS IN OUR REGION HAS BEEN DIMINISHED 

 BY THE DECISIONS OF THE LANGE LABOR GOVERNMENT IN

 New Zea la n d.

 The Hawke Government has done v ir t u a l l y  n o thing 

 w h il e  New Zealand has opted out of ANZUS by

 EFFECTIVELY DENYING THE USE OF ITS PORTS TO THE

 Un it e d  St a t e s .

 I nstead Au s t r a l ia ' s preo ccupatio n has been to support

 THE CREATION OF A NUCLEAR FREE ZONE IN THE SOUTH

 Pa c i f i c .

 17.

 Both Mr Hawke and Mr Hayden c o n ven ien tly overlooki THE FACT THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NUCLEAR FREE 

 ZONE IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC WILL NOT PREVENT THE- 

 So v ie t  Un io n pla c in g nuclear armed long range

 AIRCRAFT IN VIETNAM FROM WHERE THEY COULD THREATEN 

 VIRTUALLY ALL THE SOUTH PACIFIC.

 AN EVEN MORE SERIOUS SITUATION WOULD DEVELOP IF 

 THE USSR RELOCATED SOME OF ITS SS20 MISSILES IN 

 V ie t n a m .

 Rather than a nalysin g and attem ptin g to resolve 

 Au s t r a l ia ' s long term s e c u r ity problems, the 

 Hawke Government has launched out on an o b sessive

 TANGENT.

 The end result is  Au s t r a l ia ' s for eig n p o l ic y has 

 been d iv e r t e d  from a concentration on the s it u a t io n

 IN OUR IMMEDIATE REGION.

 Mr Hawke and Mr Hayden have adopted an unbalanced

 APPROACH TO FOREIGN POLICY. IT  IS TIME THAT A 

 PROPER BALANCE WAS RESTORED.
