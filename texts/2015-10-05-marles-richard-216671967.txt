 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION   MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 

 NAURU REGIONAL PROCESSING CENTRE    

 Labor welcomes the Nauruan Government’s announcement that it will process the  remaining asylum seekers in the Regional Processing Centre as soon as possible.   

 Labor has consistently said that the Liberal Government should be working with the  Nauruan’s to ensure that all asylum seekers have access to safe, dignified and  humane refuge - we welcome the decision to make the facility more open.   

 People must have their protection claims assessed as soon as humanly practicable.   

 The Government must also ensure the incredibly serious allegations of rape and  assault are urgently investigated.   

 While today’s announcement is welcome, Labor calls on the Government to step up  its efforts to find permanent resettlement solutions for the refugees on Nauru.
