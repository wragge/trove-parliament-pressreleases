 [Introduction] [Population Change] [Economic Goal] [Social Goal] [Environmental Sustainability Goal] [Humanitarian Goal] [Conclusion]

 Introduction

 The Australian ambassador, His Excellency Mr Colin Heseltine; the New Zealand ambassador, His Excellency Mr David Taylor; chairman of the ANZCCK, Mr Rik Borger; ladies and gentlemen.

 Thank you for the invitation to speak to you this morning on Immigration: Nation Building .

 Some may think it somewhat curious that I am in South Korea, talking to expatriate Australians and New Zealanders about Australian nation building. But there is a 'certain logic' in this.

 The world is increasingly connected, resulting from the globalisation of trade, capital markets, communications, and technology.

 You represent some of the over 900,000 Australians who are part of this global labour market; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» You live and work outside of Australia, yet you are no less 'Australian'; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» You have first-hand experience of the types of challenges those who come to Australia to work and live experience, whether as migrants or temporary residents; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 You have contributed to and shaped public policy on nation building in Australia, and will continue to do so in the years to come. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Immigration has been fundamental to the building of modern Australia and is very much part of the fabric of the nation. It is in the context of building the nation, in an even stronger way, that I want to talk to you about the role of immigration in nation building.

 The notion and the ideal of nation building has always captured the attention and the affection of Australians. It was the notion of nation building that drove the federation of Australia over a hundred years ago. It was the ideal of nation building that left us a robust, deliberative, participatory and democratic legacy on which to continue to build in the 21st century.

 Indeed, it may be this legacy that encourages Australians to travel - certainly we could not travel so freely if we did not have such an open, liberal nation.

 Your presence in South Korea, though small - I understand there are around 1,500 Australians living in Korea, which is somewhat smaller than the 38,000 Korea-born in Australia - is no less important.

 Relations between Australia and South Korea in recent years have been complementary and productive, reflecting a commonality of interests:

 Shared emphasis on the importance of the Asia-Pacific region, common middle-ranking power status and mutual recognition of the benefits âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 of close cooperation.

 Australia is benefiting from Korea's increasing openness to market forces, its deregulation and privatisation of various public utilities and encouragement of higher levels of foreign investment.

 Reform of the financial and corporate sectors is creating opportunities for Australian business service providers. For example:

 South Korea was one of the first APEC members to adopt the APEC business card, along with Australia and the Philippines. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» South Korea is a member of the APEC Business Mobility Group (BMG) whose primary aim is to build the capacity of all APEC economies to support the mobility of business people, to facilitate trade and investment activity across the region. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 I want to look first very broadly at the role migration will play in Australia's future population growth.

 Population Change

 Australia has been, and is still undergoing, a demographic transition from high fertility and high mortality to low fertility and low mortality (or increasing life expectancy).

 Australia is not alone in experiencing demographic transition. Many other countries such as Italy, Japan, Spain and Greece are, in fact, further along this path.

 What this means for Australia is that on plausible assumptions about Australia's future fertility, life expectancy and net overseas migration, deaths will exceed births around the 2030s. From then on migration will be the only source of population growth.

 Without migration, our population would peak at 20.6 million in the 2020s and would begin to decline. If the decline continued it would be increasingly difficult to pull out of it.

 Provided Australia's fertility does not fall much further from its current level of 1.74 births per woman, net overseas migration averaging around 100,000 per year over the rest of the century would see our population continue to grow through to 2100, but at a very low rate from around mid century (0.2 to nearly zero per cent) compared to recent growth rates around 1.3 per cent.

 We would have a population of around 27 million in 2050 and around 29 million in 2100.

 Future workforce and economic growth

 Migration will also play an important role in relation to Australia's future workforce and economic growth.

 While Australia's population growth rate will fall over the next 50 years, workforce growth rate will also decline, and possibly more quickly, unless the labour force participation rate of women and older workers increases to address this.

 With family-friendly policies allowing choices to be made, and with continuing improvements in the health and activity levels of older workers, increases are possible.

 Again, net overseas migration around 100,000 a year, would see the potential workforce (ie the workforce aged 15-64) continue to grow until mid-century, or a bit later, and stabilise at about 15.9 million.

 Economic growth depends on workforce growth and productivity growth. The slower our workforce growth, other things equal, the slower our economic growth. Economic growth then becomes more and more dependent on an improvement in productivity.

 Values underpinning migration policy

 For most of our history, it has seemed perfectly normal that part of the business of government has been to facilitate migration to Australia, yet we are one of only a few countries in the world that have operated a planned immigration program for over 50 years.

 In that time we have learned much about the importance of managing immigration to achieve our goals.

 The principal aim of Australia's immigration system is to maximise its contribution to Australia's well being. To achieve this, Australia's immigration policy has four key goals: to contribute to Australia's economic, social, environmental and humanitarian interests.

 However, there is tension inherent in these goals, with competing interests trying to elevate one goal and under-value or disregard the others.

 It is important to balance the different perspectives of various groups in the Australian community in order to achieve a positive contribution to Australia as a whole. The way to achieve this is through sound immigration policy.

 We have learned that sound immigration policy must be underpinned by some essential core values. The five core values on which i believe good immigration policy should be based are:

 First, immigration policy must be strictly non-discriminatory in terms of race, religion, colour and ethnicity.

 Migration legislation in Australia provides clear and transparent selection criteria and procedures in this regard. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Second, immigration policy must be demonstrably in the national economic and social interest. This is crucial to nation-building.

 As I mentioned earlier, there is a vibrant Korea-born community in Australia. Many of these came as skilled migrants or students. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Research shows that our migration program has positive impacts on Australian living standards, improves income equality and has a highly beneficial impact on commonwealth and state budgets. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 We also know that migration contributes significantly to the cosmopolitan, diverse society in which we live. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Third, we must assist close family reunion to the extent that is reasonable and sensible.

 In 2001-02 nearly 25 per cent of settler arrivals from South Korea (some 189 persons) arrived in Australia under the family stream. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Australia is one of the few countries which accepts applications for family migration based on de facto, fiancÃ© and interdependent relationships as well as spouse and dependent children. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Fourth, we must contribute our fair share to the resettlement of those most in humanitarian need.

 Australia continues to play a leading role in resettling people in compelling humanitarian need from Africa, the Middle East, and South-West Asia, and the former Yugoslavia. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Twelve thousand new places have been made available for Australia's humanitarian program for 2002-03. These will be supplemented by the 1,296 unused places rolled over from 2001-02. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 And last, but by no means least, we must retain the capacity to manage the movement of people across our borders in an orderly and efficient manner.

 Without this crucial element, the idea of a managed immigration policy that can make a significant contribution to our goals and nation building could become meaningless.

 The government has put in place its plan for controlling this flow comprising legislation changes; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» international cooperation; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» an effective application processing regimÃ©; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» active law enforcement and intelligence. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 At the same time we are continuing to promote the value of our planned migration and humanitarian programs and refine these.

 In fact, the focus of my visit to South Korea is to discuss and encourage South Korea's ongoing regional cooperation and participation in developing regional solutions to combat people smuggling and trafficking in order to protect regional security.

 These underlying values have enabled Australia to develop and maintain one of the best immigration systems in the world, while adapting to a rapidly changing global environment.

 Economic Goal

 I want to emphasise that a fundamental purpose of government policy, and of immigration policy within this, is to deliver the best long-term outcome in terms of the living standards and well-being of all Australians.

 In the 1950s and 1960s, both skilled and less skilled labour was needed. In the 1970s and 1980s, as the world became a more complex place and technology emerged, skills increasingly became important.

 Over the 1990s, the importance of skills to our nation became even more apparent as technology changed more quickly, globalisation of markets became entrenched, and Australia's future lay more in the knowledge society.

 The skills needed in this changing world cannot be entirely met from our education and training institutions and immigration has to play its part. A central tenet of our strategy was to focus more of the migration program towards the skill stream in order to deliver both migrants and temporary residents with needed skills and expertise, to ensure Australia's immigration policies became more closely aligned to Australia's economic interests.

 In 2001-02 nearly 63 per cent of South Korean settlers (some 472 persons) arrived under the skill stream of the migration program. Against this background I announced in April the migration program for 2002-03 and importantly, for the next three years.

 2002-03 program

 The 2002-03 migration program is the largest and most highly skilled program in over a decade. The planning level is set in the range of 100,000 to 110,000 places for each of the next four financial years, barring exceptional circumstances. At the mid-point it will be 12,000 more places than the outcome for 2001-2002.

 The bulk of the increase will be in the skill stream, which will have 60,700 places, compared to the record of 53,520 places for 2001-02. This represents about 58 per cent of the total program.

 The program is flexible - it can, for example, move to the top of the range should there be increases in the availability of high standard, skilled applicants, or in the take-up of state-specific and regional migration categories.

 The new program responds to Australia's economic and social needs, both for the present and longer term. It will help ensure that skill shortages do not hold back the Australian economy.

 Skill Stream

 The research shows that current immigration policy settings are delivering a positive impact on Australian living standards, improved income equality, a highly beneficial impact on commonwealth and state budgets, and the improved retention of migrants with skills and qualifications that are sought after by Australian employers.

 Modelling by Econtech for my Department suggests that the new program, if maintained until 2007-08, together with the increasingly strong focus on skilled migration and the many improvements made to migration policy since 1995-96, will deliver an increase of $344 per head in living standards for all Australians compared with a continuation of the 1995-96 migration program.

 The Commonwealth Budget, according to Access Economics modelling, would benefit to the tune of $4.3 billion over 4 years, and $32.7 billion over 10 years if the 2002-2003 migration program level continued. Skilled migrants contribute most of this benefit.

 This is due to both the increased focus on the skill stream as well as changes to selection criteria to better target the skills we need.

 Today's independent skilled principal migrants are younger, have better English language skills and hold qualifications that are in national shortage. Almost half have obtained their qualifications from an Australian educational institution.

 They bring new ideas, skills, technology, understanding and contacts. They are reducing skill bottlenecks and shortages, helping develop new businesses, contributing to technological development and enhancing our knowledge of international business markets.

 Changes to Citizenship Law

 Recent changes to our citizenship law may also encourage a growing number of Australians who live and work overseas to come back to Australia to use their skills and contacts developed overseas.

 The Australian citizenship amendment act came into force on 4 april 2002. As a result, Australians who now acquire the citizenship of another country will no longer lose their Australian citizenship.

 These amendments to our citizenship law recognise the reality of the global labour market, and will allow Australia to be more competitive on an international scale.

 Temporary Entry

 The economic, budgetary and employment gains do not just come from permanent migration.

 Net long-term temporary movements now account for around 50 per cent of our net overseas migration. This compares with just 20 per cent only six years ago.

 These temporary entrants generate very substantial economic benefits.

 Overseas students contribute over $4 billion dollars in export revenue annually. Last year over 4,300 Koreans were granted visas to study in Australia. Mostly for six month language programs.

 Working holidaymakers spend around $1.3 billion annually in Australia. A working holidaymaker (WHM) agreement between South Korea and Australia commenced in July 1995. In 2001-02 some 3,364 working holidaymaker visas were granted.

 Skilled long-term temporary business entrants also provide substantial fiscal and economic benefits.

 Social Goal

 Over the last 200 years we have built on the diversity that already existed in this country's indigenous population to deliver the reality of our modern, multicultural community.

 While the policies of thirty and forty years ago sought simply to acknowledge and accommodate recent migrants, we now have policies and programs that, rightly, emphasise the benefits flowing from the full spectrum of our diverse people.

 Today, close to one in four of Australia's 19.7 million people was born overseas, a proportion significantly higher than in any other traditional immigration country.

 Australia cannot maintain a humanitarian program, or invite people in to take up jobs, or indeed have a program of family reunion without acknowledging that change to our society is an inevitable consequence.

 Managing that change has been a key to managing successful migration and humanitarian programs.

 Multiculturalism

 We have embraced multiculturalism and, as a result, the diversity of our population has delivered us benefits in creating a vital and thriving community and economy.

 We have a population that is broader in its outlook, better able to accommodate change and better able to engage with difference.

 Our diverse workforce has also given us pathways to new markets, innovation and a more robust business sector.

 The cohesive, multicultural society we are today is a constant reminder of how much we continue to benefit from our long and proud history of

 immigration.

 Environmental Sustainability Goal

 We are committed to an environmentally sustainable Australia. It is simplistic to link environmental degradation solely to the size of our domestic population. This ignores the complexity of the issue.

 We must seek to minimise the environmental impact of our population, whatever its size, through adoption of improved environmental practices.

 The coming decades of economic growth are a vital period of opportunity. During this period we have the opportunity to incorporate the most advanced technology into our buildings, cars and transport systems.

 This would allow energy, material and waste flows to stabilise and new export industries rich in services and information to develop.

 A reasonable level of migration, with a skilled focus, would allow us to build up the kind of intellectual and financial capital we will need during this period.

 Whether we make the most of this period of opportunity to lighten our environmental impact is ultimately a question for all Australians.

 Top

 Humanitarian Goal

 Australia's humanitarian program will continue to give priority to people in the most vulnerable situations and have the greatest need for resettlement.

 Australia is one of only nine countries that operate a dedicated resettlement program each year.

 The resettlement program goes beyond any international obligations and reflects Australia's desire to assist refugees and people in humanitarian need.

 Per capita, Australia has one of the highest resettlement rates in the world. The costs of sustaining refugees include the provision of a generous suite of settlement services to help refugees successfully settle into Australian society.

 Conclusion

 Australia is a country uniquely defined by its land, its indigenous people and inheritance and by the settlement of migrants.

 Australian society has been built on the fundamental principles of fairness and decency and the premise that opportunity should be equally available to all, regardless of background, gender, race or religion.

 These values have formed an essential foundation on which Australia has been able to be transformed into one of the world's most successful, culturally diverse, democratic, national communities.

 By harnessing these pluralities constructively Australia coped with the major changes of the 20th century without constitutional upheavals, civil war, or even major civil commotion.

 Our pro-active migration policies have established our identity as a dynamic nation committed to diversity and open to the world.

 The contribution of immigrant talent and skill to the labour force has greatly enhanced our prosperity.

 We also know that migration contributes significantly to the cosmopolitan, diverse society in which we live.

 In recent years, and in the face of increasing international competition, we have been able to successfully adapt to the changing needs of the Australian economy, labour market and the phenomena of globalisation.

 Our current approach to immigration and population provides a solid foundation from which we can continue to build Australia's future. We cannot, however, rest on our laurels. International competition in industry and for skilled labour is continuing.

 We also face challenges in managing our declining rate of growth in, and the ageing of, our population and labour force.

 Migration has an important role to play in our future. The focus is on well-managed migration, humanitarian and settlement programs, with the benefits not put at risk by unauthorised arrivals.

 If we retain this focus, Australia looks forward to a prosperous and sustainable future.
