  TICKNER TO VISIT PAPUA NEW GUL A 

  / 

  The Federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Robert  Tickner, will commence a week-long visit to Papua New Guinea on Sunday, 10  April 1994. 

  The visit will have particular focus on the Western Province of Papua New  Guinea, Australia's closest neighbour which is only 21an from Australia. The  closest Torres Strait Islands to Papua New Guinea are Boigu, Saibai and Dauan. 

  "The Western Province is a relatively undeveloped area of Papua New Guinea  and, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs, has not been visited by an  Australian Government Minister since the late Sir Paul Rasluck went there in the  1960s as the Minister for External Affairs and Territories," Mr Tickner said. 

  "The Western Province is of particular interest to Torres Strait Islanders and to my  portfolio because of the Torres Strait Treaty, which regulates contact between  Australian and Papua New Guinean inhabitants of the Torres Strait Islands, and  delineates boundaries between the two countries ." 

  The proposal for the visit arose from Mr Tickner's attendance at the December  1993 Joint Ministerial Forum between Papua New Guinea and Australia, held in  MtRagen. 

  The Minister will hold talks with the Prime Minister, the Rt Ron Paias Wingti; the  Minister for Village Services and Provincial Affairs, the Ron John Nilkare; the  Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Ron Titus Philemon; and  Papua New Guinean national and provincial officials. 

  Mr Tickner will travel to Tabubil for a tour of the Ok Tedi mine and will hold  discussions with mine management and environmental personnel, and visit the  local village and hospital. From Tabubil, he will visit the East Awin refugee camp  and travel to Kiunga by helicopter along the path of the Fly River.

  NOTES TO THE MEDIA 

   " It is anticipated that Mr Tickner will hold a news conference at the Australian  High Commission at 1 L30am on Monday, 11 April (in the ground exhibition  hall, amid a display from "The First Australian" exhibition). 

   " For the benefit of members of the media who would find it difficult to cover  the Minister's departure from Dam, he will conduct a broadcast-quality  telephone interview with the Radio sub-section of the Australian High  Commission's Public Affairs Section at 10.30am on Friday, 15 April. The  interview will be transcribed for print media and audio tapes will be supplied  to the electronic media.
