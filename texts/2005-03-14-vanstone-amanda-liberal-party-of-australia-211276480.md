 Refugee Families to Arrive in South Australia

 VPS 043/2005

 Sixty-four refugees from Central Africa - including 36 children - will arrive in South Australia tomorrow, Minister for Immigration, Amanda  Vanstone, announced today. 

 ‘On behalf of all Australians, I welcome them to their new home and future,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 The refugees are part of a group of 336 people being resettled in Australia who had been living in refugee camps in Tanzania after fleeing  persecution in countries including Burundi, the Republic of Congo and other central African countries. 

 ‘The group arriving in SA tomorrow will initially be settling in Kilburn, Woodville, Athol Park, Port Adelaide, Klemzig, Maylands, Richmond,  Northfield and Campbelltown,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘They will receive intensive support through a number of service providers including cultural orientation assistance, links to essential services such  as Centrelink, Medicare and banking, accommodation support, help in establishing a household and health and psychological services and  information.’

 Australia has been asked by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to resettle these refugees.

 ‘They have been living in desperate situations in these camps, which do not have running water or electricity,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘On average they have spent eight years in camps.’

 The 336 refugees are arriving in stages and are settling in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania  and the Northern Territory.

 ‘The experiences they have had to endure means they need the support of the Australian Government and all Australians to ensure their transition  to their new lives is a success,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘As Australians we can be proud of our generous spirit and the many programs we have in place to help these refugees to become self-sufficient  and participate in the community as quickly as possible.

 ‘The refugees are among the 13,000 people who will be resettled in Australia in 2004-05 under the Humanitarian Program.’
