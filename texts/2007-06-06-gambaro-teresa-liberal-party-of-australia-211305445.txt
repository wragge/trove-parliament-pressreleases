 Media Centre  SA communities welcome Burmese refugees 

 Wednesday, 6 June 2007 

 The Limestone Coast was congratulated by Assistant Minister for Immigration  and Citizenship Teresa Gambaro today on its commitment to refugees as the  communities of Mt Gambier and Grant prepare to welcome two families from  Burma.  

 The Burmese families are the first refugees to be settled in the region directly  from overseas under the Australian Government’s regional humanitarian  settlement initiative.  

 ‘Regional towns can offer very positive settlement outcomes for many  refugees,’ Ms Gambaro said.  

 ‘Country communities can provide a warm welcome, friendship and support  for these families, many of whom have experienced great hardship and  trauma.’  

 ‘Some refugees also find it easier to secure employment in regional towns,  helping provide security for their families and allowing them to participate in  Australian society.’  

 Planning for refugee settlement has been underway for some time and has  been strongly supported by the Mount Gambier City Council and District  Council of Grant, the Limestone Coast Area Consultative Committee and  Regional Development Board, local service providers and community groups.  

 The first families are scheduled to arrive in June. Settlement of further families  is planned.  

 An evaluation will follow to examine how well settlement is progressing,  identify areas for improvement, and consider the town’s capacity for ongoing  refugee settlement.  

 Ms Gambaro said the settlement initiative in Mt Gambier followed a successful  settlement programme in Shepparton, where a small community of Congolese  families were settled in the town from November 2005.  

 ‘The Limestone Coast’s commitment to assisting these families demonstrates  both compassion and a commitment to a fair go for all,’ Ms Gambaro added.
