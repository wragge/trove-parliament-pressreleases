 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison  

 Labor lies over turn backs further exposed as Burke admits his policy free  zone on illegal boats 

 Friday 5th July 2013 

 The former Chief of the Australian Navy’s comments today have further exposed Labor’s lies over the 

 Coalition’s policy to turn back boats where it is safe to do so, as Tony Burke confirmed today Labor has no 

 policy on stopping the record illegal boat arrivals occurring on their watch, Shadow Minister for Immigration 

 and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today. 

 “Unlike Labor which has given up and was never serious about border protection, the Coalition has a full 

 suite of proven border protection measures to stop the boats, including turning back boats where safe to do 

 so,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “Today the former Chief of the Australian Navy (2002 to 2005), Retired Vice Admiral Chris Ritchie exposed 

 Kevin Rudd and Tony Burke’s desperate attempt to trash the Coalition’s policies, telling the ABC that turn 

 backs are: 

  ‘…a legitimate Navy operation. It’s something that Navies have done over centuries and in that sense, 

 if the Government gives a direction to do it, the Navy people will do it and they’ll do it well.’ 

 And: 

 ‘If the conditions were replicated, it could still work.’ 

 “This follows comments from the former Australian Defence AttachÃ© to Indonesia, Retired Brigadier Gary 

 Hogan who yesterday told the ABC: 

 ‘I do think it's possible for us to push back boats or to intercept boats and to lead them back to 

 their source.’ 

 “If elected, the Coalition will implement a full suite of proven border protection policies including turning 

 boats around where it is safe to do so. By contrast Tony Burke has today admitted Labor don’t have 

 policies to stop the boats, saying they were ‘up for review’. 

 “Unlike Labor, the Coalition for over a decade has had a full suite of tough border protection measures and 

 the necessary resolve to stop the boats and won’t stop advocating for these policies between now and the 

 election. 

 “The contrast between the Coalition’s proven policies and resolve and Labor’s failed record and lack of 

 policy on stopping the boats couldn’t be starker. 

 “It was the Kevin Rudd and Tony Burke team who rolled out the Rudd-carpet for illegal boat arrivals that 

 has led to unprecedented cost, chaos and tragedy on our borders. 

 “They can’t be taken seriously on border protection. If Labor were to be re-elected Kevin Rudd and Tony 

 Burke would have ensured people smugglers had not just won the battle, but also the war,” Mr Morrison 

 said.
