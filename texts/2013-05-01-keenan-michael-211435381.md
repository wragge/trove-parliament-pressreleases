 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling BIGGEST EVER MONTH FOR ILLEGAL  ARRIVALS - 45 BOATS AND 3,300 PEOPLE May 01, 2013

 The arrival of two more illegal boats, with a total of almost 200 people on board, means 45 boats with over 3,300 people  on board arrived in April, the biggest ever month for illegal arrivals, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott  Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “Julia Gillard is presiding over complete chaos on our borders. Every month now under her Prime Ministership thousands  of people are sent here on perilous illegal boat journeys by criminal people smugglers at huge profit,” Mr Morrison said.

 “45 illegal boats with 3,316 people on board in just one month is an astonishing level of failure. Last month’s arrivals alone  were a staggering 1,100% higher than arrivals by boat over the entire last six years of the Howard Government.

 “The extent of Labor’s failure has grown so substantially under Julia Gillard in just the last year that April’s arrivals were  more than eight times higher than in April 2012. 

 “Of the two latest boats one appears to have originated from Sri Lanka as people smugglers from far and wide continue to  take advantage of Labor’s failure.

 “A government that has forced Australians to pay over $4 billion more than they budgeted for since the last election thanks  to their border protection failures is now set to demand even more at next week’s budget because Julia Gillard refuses to  implement the Coalition’s proven policies to stop the boats and end the cost, chaos and tragedy on our borders,” Mr  Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “The latest arrival is the 500th boat to arrive since the last election, where the Gillard Government  promised to squash the people smuggling trade and stop the boats from coming.

 “500 boats later this is clearly another broken promise by the Prime Minister.

 “Despite once again relying on the Australian Federal Police to assist in intercepting boat arrivals, Labor has done nothing  but strip funding from the agency in its last two consecutive budgets.

 “This includes the $133 million cut from the AFP in the last budget alone.

 “Given the extra duties that have been apportioned to the AFP in dealing with Labor’s border protection failures, the  Gillard Government should restore the funding and personnel cuts that they have made to the agency since coming to  office,” Mr Keenan said.
