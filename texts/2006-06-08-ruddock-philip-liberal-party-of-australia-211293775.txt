  [Introduction] 

 1. It’s not so long ago that fingerprint and iris scans to 

 enter buildings or access computers would have 

 seemed like something from the distant future. 

 2. But biometric technology is now here.   

 And it is being used increasingly by businesses, police, 

 researchers and governments in a wide range of 

 applications.    

 3. It is becoming increasingly sophisticated and new 

 applications are constantly emerging. 

 4. You might be familiar with a National Geographic 

 program a few years ago which traced the search for 

 the “Afghan girl” photographed in a refugee camp in 

 Pakistan in 1985 during the Soviet occupation of 

 Afghanistan - and who had featured on the cover of the 

 magazine all those years ago.   

 You might remember the photograph because of her 

 haunting green eyes.   

 The “Afghan girl”, now a woman in her thirties, 

 remarkably was found just a couple of years ago, and 

 her identity confirmed, using iris-scanning technology 

 and face recognition techniques.

 5. It is amazing to see just how far these technologies 

 have come and to think they can be used to confirm 

 someone’s identity after seventeen years.   

 6. The use of biometric technology certainly has many 

 advantages. 

 7. For example the identity markers that are verified are 

 unique physical attributes which are constant.   

 This brings an element of ease and efficiency, as well 

 as security to biometric testing.   

 8. Such qualities make it far more difficult to steal and 

 replicate these identity markers than other forms of 

 identity, including passwords.   

 9. This is why the Australian Government is moving 

 towards a greater use of biometrics in identity and 

 travel documents. 

  [Why Identity Security is Important] 

 10. Identity security is central to Australia's national 

 security, law enforcement and economic interests. 

 11. False identities underpin terrorist and criminal activity 

 and undermine border and citizenship controls and 

 efforts to combat terrorist financing and financial 

 crime.

 12. Stolen identities can be used to open bank accounts or 

 to fraudulently apply for credit cards, passports or 

 government benefits. 

 13. And terrorists use false or stolen identities to move 

 their operatives and their deadly tools of trade in and 

 out of countries. 

 14. For example, the nineteen terrorists involved in the 

 attacks on September 11 used more than three hundred 

 and fifty false names in planning and executing their 

 horrifying attacks on the United States. 

 15. According to the most recent figures available, 

 identity fraud costs Australians at least $1.1 billion 

 annually. 

 16. Internationally, the figure could be as high as  

 $2 trillion.     

 17. Only a few months ago we saw reports that tens of 

 millions of dollars of emergency funding intended for 

 the victims of Hurricane Katrina was wrongly paid out 

 because of ID fraud.  

 18. Of course the cost of this type of fraud is not just 

 measured in dollars.

 19. A person’s identity is an extremely valuable asset. 

 So when someone’s identity is stolen, it can also have 

 a devastating emotional effect.   

 20. Indeed, it can take victims years to get their personal 

 and financial affairs back in order.  

 21. Whether we are aware of it or not, we are all exposed 

 to the prospect of having our identities stolen.    

 22. As technology continues to develop and become more 

 sophisticated, so to, the methods criminals and 

 terrorists use to hack into computers, forge documents 

 and steal identity information have become more 

 advanced. 

 23. We need to beat criminals at their own game - and 

 biometric identification can help us to do this. 

 [National Identity Security Strategy] 

 24. In April last year the Council of Australian 

 Governments agreed to investigate how biometric 

 security measures could be adopted by all the States 

 and Territories to help improve identity security across 

 Australia. 

 25. This is part of the National Identity Security Strategy 

 which the Government is working on with the states 

 

 Biometrics Institute Annual Australia Conference  8 June 2006  AGD final

 and territories. 

 Biometrics has the potential to play a key role in this.   

 26. The strategy aims to combat identity theft and the 

 fraudulent use of stolen and assumed identities. 

 27. It also aims to develop and strengthen the existing 

 processes used for personal identification - and to 

 make sure that the procedures are consistent across 

 jurisdictions. 

 28. One of our most recent initiatives in this area, as 

 announced in the Budget, is the allocation of  

 $28.3 million to establish a national Document 

 Verification Service.   

 29. This new service builds on the prototype service 

 developed and trialled in the past 12 months, and 

 allows for online, real time verification of documents 

 presented to government agencies.   

 30. As part of the National Identity Security Strategy there 

 are also a number of key activities in which biometric 

 applications will play a role in correctly identifying 

 people, better securing documents and better 

 protecting the identities of all Australians.

 31. However, the use of biometrics raises complex 

 technical, security and privacy issues that require 

 careful consideration.   

 [Privacy] 

 32. I am aware of the concerns people have that by 

 increasing the use of biometrics we are moving 

 towards some form of “Big Brother” state.  

 33. Australians value their right to privacy.   

 And rightly so.   

 34. In a democracy, everyone has a right to privacy - and 

 this is not a right we want to trample on.  

 35. The Government actively defends the right to privacy. 

 It is one of the reasons we are constantly looking at 

 ways to further strengthen our national identity 

 security regime - there can be no greater invasion of 

 a person’s privacy than the theft of their identity. 

 36. But in considering the use of biometric technologies 

 we need to look at what solutions best meet the needs 

 of Australia and the Australian people. 

 37. And we must balance concerns about privacy with the 

 need for national security. 

 

 Biometrics Institute Annual Australia Conference  8 June 2006  AGD final

 This is a responsibility this Government and I, as 

 Attorney-General, take very seriously.  

 38. Indeed, biometric information is already afforded a 

 high level of protection under the current privacy 

 framework.  

 39. The collection, storage, security, use and disclosure of 

 personal information by commonwealth government 

 agencies and private sector organisations are regulated 

 under the Privacy Act - this includes biometric 

 information. 

 40. And the Privacy Commissioner is closely involved 

 with identity security initiatives to ensure they comply 

 with the Act. 

 [Smartcard] 

 41. In recent months there has been considerable public 

 and media interest in identity security and privacy in 

 the context of the national identity card debate.    

 42. Most of you will be aware that the Prime Minister 

 announced in March the Government will be 

 introducing a Department of Human Services 

 Smartcard. 

 

 Biometrics Institute Annual Australia Conference  8 June 2006  AGD final

 43. This is not a national identity card.   

 It will not be mandatory and there is no requirement to 

 carry or produce the card.   

 44. The Smartcard will replace seventeen other existing 

 cards and will provide a reliable and convenient way 

 for people to access and obtain government benefits.  

 45. The card will include a digital biometric photograph 

 of the holder which will help to protect the  

 card-holder’s identity and reduce opportunities for 

 fraud… 

 this is a priority for the Government as we want to 

 ensure taxpayers’ money goes to the right people and 

 that they get the right payment. 

 46. Of course, we are not the only country looking at 

 introducing cards with biometric data. 

 47. All around the world, countries are moving to 

 introduce biometrics into identity and travel 

 documents to improve the security and reliability of 

 identity checks.

 48. Two months ago, Spain launched its e-ID card which 

 contains a fingerprint, a digitised photograph and a 

 digitised signature of the holder.   

 The e-ID card is progressively being distributed to all 

 Spanish citizens.     

 49. Also this year, Britain took the first steps towards 

 introducing a national identity card.   

 The proposed identity card is intended to contain 

 facial, iris and fingerprint data and will be backed up 

 by a National Identity Register. 

 50. Australia will continue to watch these and other 

 overseas developments with interest. 

 [Protecting Australia’s Borders] 

 51. As I mentioned earlier, we want to make it harder for 

 terrorists to cross our borders and infiltrate our 

 security systems.   

 52. Notwithstanding our obvious geographical advantage, 

 Australia has one of the most stringently managed 

 border control regimes in world. 

 53. But we need to continue to be able to effectively 

 monitor and control who is moving in, and out, of our 

 country. 

 

 Biometrics Institute Annual Australia Conference  8 June 2006  AGD final  

 11 

 54. And one of the best ways to do this is to protect the 

 integrity of our passports.   

 55. I’m very pleased to say that Australia is a leader in the 

 development of biometric passport technology and 

 one of the first countries in the world to have started 

 using e-Passports. 

 The e-Passport has an embedded microchip which 

 stores the holder’s digitised biometric photograph as 

 well as other personal details such as name, gender, 

 date of birth and nationality. 

 56. An e-Passport will now be issued to all new applicants 

 and people seeking to renew their passport. 

 Processing facilities for the new passports are 

 gradually being introduced at Australian and overseas 

 airports. 

 57. Australia is now well on the way to introducing its 

 automated border processing system, known as 

 SmartGate, into Australian airports.  

 58. A live trial of SmartGate has been run out of Sydney 

 and Melbourne international airports.  

 59. Over seven thousand Qantas Crew and Qantas 

 Platinum Frequent Flyers participated and conducted 

 

 Biometrics Institute Annual Australia Conference  8 June 2006  AGD final  

 12 

 more than two hundred and sixty thousand 

 transactions.   

 60. The results of the trial will be used in the development 

 of SmartGate Series 1 which will be introduced into 

 Australian international airports next year. 

 61. SmartGate is an exciting, cutting edge initiative. 

 It’s the first fully operational face recognition system 

 for border control in the world - so Australia is truly 

 leading the way in introducing biometric technology 

 to protect its borders. 

 [Working with Industry] 

 62. Biometric technology is complex and fast developing 

 and its implementation brings with it many challenges. 

 63. One of the current challenges we are facing is a lack 

 of consistency in biometric standards.   

 64. Closed and proprietary biometric solutions mean that 

 standards are developing in different ways and there is 

 a lack of interoperability across government agencies.   

 65. This is inefficient and creates increased cost.     

 66. As key players in this industry, you can assist us to 

 create consistent, compatible systems by supporting 

 

 Biometrics Institute Annual Australia Conference  8 June 2006  AGD final  

 13 

 open standards and encouraging standard 

 convergence.      

 67. This will be one of the things we will be looking at 

 during the development of the Australian Government 

 Biometrics Framework.   

 68. Developing the framework is a complex task and we 

 would like to work collaboratively with all 

 stakeholders to ensure it meets the needs of industry 

 and government.   

 [Conclusion] 

 69. Today I have given you an overview of how the 

 Government is using biometrics to improve identity 

 security and reduce identity fraud in Australia. 

 70. In the next two days you will hear more about specific 

 developments in biometric technology and how it is 

 being used by governments and businesses. 

 71. But biometric technology changes quickly.  

 What is current and new today quickly becomes dated. 

 72. The initiatives we have undertaken to date are a 

 measure of our ongoing commitment to keeping 

 Australians safe and protected - from thieves and 

 

 Biometrics Institute Annual Australia Conference  8 June 2006  AGD final  

 14 

 fraudsters… and those whose intentions might be even 

 more sinister in terms of harming our community. 

 73. You can be assured the Government will continue to 

 work with you to implement the best and most up-to-date technology. 

 74. Thank you for inviting me to speak you today - I am 

 delighted to officially open this conference.
