 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH   

 10 May 2011   

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR,  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW,  PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA   

 Subjects: Border protection; Budget; mental health.   

 E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It seems that the Government’s deal with Malaysia is unravelling even before it’s been fully done. It seems  that the longer these negotiations lasted the weaker the Government’s position got. It seems that in its panic  and desperation to cobble together something that they might be able to announce, the Government has  surrendered Australia’s national interest. It seems that already the Malaysians are saying that they want to  vet the people who we send there, and what that means is that the Government’s claims that the next 800  boat people who arrive in Australia will end up in Malaysia are simply false. This is yet another example of  the Government making false and misleading claims to the Australian people. It’s yet another example of  the utter incompetence and untrustworthiness of this Government.   

 QUESTION:   

 [Inaudible] just want to get the message out in these other countries [inaudible]?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 But the message is that if you want to come to Australia Malaysia is the open back door. I mean, the only  test of this is will it stop the boats, and on the record of this Government there can be no confidence  whatsoever that it has any real plan to stop the boats. Its plan is not to stop the boats, it’s to swap the boats,  and it’s obviously something which people can have no confidence in whatsoever. We know what works.  We know what works. What works is Nauru, Manus, temporary protection visas and the willingness to turn  boats around if it’s safe to do so, and again I challenge the Prime Minister to pick up the phone to the  President of Nauru, because Nauru doesn’t have any illegal detainees of its own to send back to Australia.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, will the Opposition support any of the Government’s measures to get more people off welfare  and into work, and the mental health policy which could actually be quite similar to yours?   

 TONY ABBOTT:

 Well, the first point to make is that I’m pleased that the Opposition seems to have shamed the Government  into finally doing something on mental health. If the Government were to adopt my four point plan to boost  participation of course I’d be supportive. But let’s wait and see what the Government actually does. I see  they’re now flagging a greater use of Work for the Dole. Work for the Dole is a programme that the  Resources Minister once called ‘almost evil’ and which the Government has slashed by 60 per cent since  2007.   

 QUESTION:   

 [Inaudible] political agenda in this country?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I think that what the Coalition is doing is first holding the Government to account and second putting  forward credible alternative policies, and I think those alternative policies are starting to resonate with the  Australian people.   

 QUESTION:   

 What about the mental health spending though? It’s an extra $2 billion. I know we haven’t seen the detail  but given your rhetoric on this issue surely that’s something you’d welcome.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, as I said, I would be pleased if the Coalition has finally shamed the Government into doing what it  should have done long ago on mental health.   

 QUESTION:   

 Do you expect that money will be linked to other measures such as the change to the private health  insurance rebate and if it is will you finally accept those changes?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 What the Coalition will never do is accept the kind of class war cuts which this Government excels in. I  mean, why shouldn’t people have a choice in healthcare, choice in education? Who says that two school  teachers in a household are rich? Who says that a nurse and a policeman in a family are rich? I think what  this Government is doing is punishing people who aspire to a better life.   

 QUESTION:   

 [Inaudible] block the mental health funding if it is linked to [inaudible]?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 No, no, no. I’m saying that I certainly would never oppose a government that is adopting Coalition policy  but I would certainly oppose a government which is going against its own pre-election commitments and  which is doing something that the Coalition thinks is fundamentally wrong.   

 QUESTION:   

 Do you see potential for rorting in the set top box plan [inaudible]?   

 TONY ABBOTT:

 Let’s wait and see what the Government actually has in mind but it certainly has a very, very poor track  record when it comes to competently and safely delivering programmes.   

 QUESTION:   

 Joe Hockey seems to be pretty confident that the Opposition can possibly get the budget back into surplus  before the Government. Will you be outlining your plans to do that on Thursday night?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 We’ve already, in the lead up to the election, announced $50 billion worth of savings over the forward  estimates period that would have produced an $11 billion improvement to the Government’s bottom line and  a $30 billion improvement to the Government’s debt position.   

 QUESTION:   

 How about the moves to potentially overhaul the disability support pension? We see some tougher reporting  requirements outlined to date. Would the Opposition support that?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well again, if the Government is prepared to adopt my four point plan to improve participation I’d be only  too happy to be supportive but let’s wait and see what they actually do.   

 QUESTION:   

 You visited Alice Springs recently and have been vocal about the issues there. Are you hoping to see  spending on indigenous health tonight?    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 What I’d like to see is the Prime Minister come down off her high horse and come with me to Alice Springs  to see the problems on the ground and to talk to indigenous leaders about what we can do to ensure that the  kids go to school, the adults go to work and the law is enforced. That’s what we need. Otherwise, we’re  going to see very serious social dysfunction in Alice Springs and elsewhere in the Territory just get worse.    

 Thank you.
