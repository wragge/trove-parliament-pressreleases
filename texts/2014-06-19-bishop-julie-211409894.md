 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS 

 The Hon Julie Bishop MP  19 June 2014 

 

 AUSTRALIA RESPONDS TO HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN IRAQ 

 

 Today I announce that Australia will provide $5 million in assistance to support the  hundreds of thousands of people fleeing violence in north and northwest Iraq, resulting  in a serious humanitarian crisis.   

 The Australian Government strongly condemns the actions of the terrorist group, the  Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which continues its campaign of violence in  Iraq.    

 We express our deepest condolences for the loss of life in recent attacks, and our  grave concern at the widespread displacement of Iraqis and damage to property.     

 The Australian Government continues to acknowledge the ongoing efforts of the  Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government to extend humanitarian  support to those displaced by ISIL aggression.    

 Australia’s assistance will help protect people as they flee to safety, and provide food,  medical assistance, tents, access to clean water and hygiene kits.    

 Australia will work with the World Food Programme and the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees to deliver our aid and ensure it reaches those who need it  most.
