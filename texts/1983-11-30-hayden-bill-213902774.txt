 INTEGRITY AND CALLED FOR THE STRICT OBSERVANCE OF THESE PR IN C IP L ES .   THEY RECORDED THEIR PROFOUND REGRET OVER THE TRAGIC LOSS OF LIFE IN   GRENADA.

 10. HEADS OF GOVERNMENT AGREED, HOWEVER, THAT THE EMPHASIS SHOULD   NOW BE ON RECONSTRUCTION, NOT RECRIMINATION. THEY WELCOMED THE   ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERIM C I V I L I A N  ADMINISTRATION IN  GRENADA. THEY   LOOKED FORWARD TO IT S FU NCTIONING FREE OF EXTERNAL INTERFERENCE,  

 PRESSURE OR THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN MILITARY FORCES AND NOTED ITS   INT ENTION TO HOLD, AS EARLY AS P O S S IB L E , ELECTIONS WHICH WOULD BE   SEEN BY ÎÎÎÎÎÎ¤Î¤Î¤Î Î¯ÎÎ‘ÎIO N A C COMMUNITY TO B E" TREE "A N D~' FA I R . Î N Î¤ÎÎª S~   B A S I S ,  AND GIVEN THE READINESS OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE CARIBBEAN   COMMUNITY TO A S S IS T  I N  THE MAINTENANCE OF LAW AND ORDER I N  GRENADA IF   SO REQUESTED BY THE IN TER IM  A D M IN IS T R A T IO N , COMMONWEALTH LEADERS   CONFIRMED THEIR READINESS TO GIVE SYMPATHETIC CONSIDERATION TO   REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE ISLAND STATE. I N  DOING SO, THEY   STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE THEY ATTACHED TO AN EARLY RETURN OF   COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES OF THE CARIBBEAN TO THE S P I R I T  OF FRATERNITY   AND CO-OPERATION THAT HAD BEEN SO CHARACTERISTIC OF REGION.

THEY RECOGNISED THAT   THE COMMONWEALTH ITSELF HAD GIVEN SOME ATTENTION TO THESE NEEDS IN   THE CONTEXT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BUT FELT THAT THE MATTER DESERVED   CONSIDERATION ON A WIDER B A S I S ,  IN C L U D IN G  THAT OF NATIONAL SECURITY.  

 RECALLING THE PARTICULAR DANGERS FACED I N  THE PAST BY SMALL   COMMONWEALTH COUN TRIES , THEY REQUESTED THE SECRETARY-GENERAL TO   UNDERTAKE A STUDY, DRAWING AS NECESSARY ON THE RESOURCES AND   EXPERIENCE OF COMMONWEALTH COUN TRIES , OF THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF SUCH   STATES CONSONANT WITH THE RIGHT TO SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL   INTEGRITY THAT THEY SHARED WITH ALL NATIONS.

 SOUTHERN AFRICA

 12. HEADS OF GOVERNMENT EXPRESSED GRAVE CONCERN ABOUT THE SHARP   DETERIORATION OF THE SITUA TION I N  SOUTHERN AFRICA SINCE THEIR MEETING   I N  MELBOURNE. ONCE AGAIN THEY ID E N T I F I E D  APARTHEID AS THE ROOT CAUSE   OF REPRESSION AND VIOLENCE I N  SOUTH AFRICA AND OF IN S T A B IL IT Y  I N  THE  

 REGION.

 13. HEADS OF GOVERNMENT EXPRESSED THEIR INDIGN AT ION AT REPEATED   VIOLATIONS BY SOUTH AFRICA OF THE TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF   NEIGHBOURING STATES. THESE ACTS OF AGRESSION, INTENDED TO INTIMIDATE   AND DESTABILISE SOUTH AFRICA'S NEIGHBOURS, HAD INVOLVED FOR EXAMPLE  

 GROUND AND AIR STR IK ES,  ATTACKS ON REFUGEE CONCENTRATIONS IN  LESOTHO   AND MOZAMBIQUE, THE OCCUPATION OF PARTS OF SOUTHERN ANGOLA, AS WELL   AS ECONOMIC SABOTAGE AND BLACKMAIL. HEADS OF GOVERNMENT CONDEMNED   THESE ACTS WHICH ENDANGERED INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY AND  

 SHOWED A TOTAL DISREGARD FOR THE NORMS OF C IV IL IS E D  CONDUCT BETWEEN   SOVEREIGN STATES. THEY BELIEVED THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE HAD AN OBLIGATION TO TAKE EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO IMPOSE   RESTRAINT ON SOUTH AFRICA, AND TO ENSURE THAT THE STABILITY OF THE  

 REGION WAS NOT JEOPARDISED BY FURTHER ACTS OF AGGRESSION. I N  THAT   CONTEXT THEY CALLED FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF SOUTH AFRICAN TROOPS FROM   ANGOLA AND AN END TO ALL FORMS OF ASSISTANCE TO THE SUBVERSIVE   FORCES. AS A SIGN IFICA NT  ELEMENT I N  COLLECTIVE ACTION TO ACHIEVE   THESE O B JEC TIV ES,  HEADS OF GOVERNMENT CALLED FOR A STRICTER  

 ENFORCEMENT OF THE MANDATORY ARMSTMBARGO 50 AS TO" ENSURE THAT THERE   ARE NO LOOPHOLES IN  THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION   4 18 OF 1977.

 14. HEADS OF GOVERNMENT RECALLED THEIR VIEW, STATED ON A NUMBER OF   PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, THAT THE DENIAL OF INALIENABLE RIGHTS TO THE   AFRICAN MAJORITY WAS AT THE HEART OF THE APARTHEID SYSTEM. IN THE   LIGHT OF THE LUSAKA DECLARATION ON RACISM AND RACIAL PREJUDICE, THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF HEADS OF GOVERNMENT REJECTED THE  

 PROPOSALS OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT FOR ' ' C O N S T I T U T I O N A L ' '   CHANGE, SINCE THE AFRICAN MAJORITY WAS WHOLLY EXCLUDED FROM THEIR   SCOPE AND THE PROPOSALS WERE DESIGNED NOT TO ERADICATE BUT TO   ENTRENCH AND STRENGTHEN APARTHEID: THEY CONSEQUENTLY CONDEMNED THE

 RECENT REFERENDUM AS FRAUDULENT. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE   PROPOSALS COULD ONLY LEAD TO A R IS IN G  TIDE OF ANGER AGAINST THE   INJUSTICE OF APARTHEID WITH FURTHER REPRESSION AND BRUTALITY DIRECTED   AT THE AFRICAN MAJORITY AND OTHER RACIAL GROUPS ACTING IN SOLIDARITY  

 WITH THEM.

 15. HEADS OF GOVERNMENT WERE OF THE VIEW THAT ONLY THE ERADICATION   OF APARTHEID AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MAJORITY RULE ON THE BASIS   OF FREE AND FAIR EXERCISE OF UNIVERSAL ADULT SUFFRAGE BY ALL THE   PEOPLE IN  A UNITED AND NON-FRAGMENTED SOUTH AFRICA CAN LEAD TO A   JUST AND LASTING SOLUTION OF, THE EXPLOSIVE SITUATION PREVAILING IN  

 SOUTHERN AFRICA.

THEY WERE IN  FULL   AGREEMENT ON THE NEED, WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY, TO BRING ABOUT THE   INDEPENDENCE OF NAMIBIA THROUGH THE FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL   IMPLEMENTATION OF SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 4 3 5  ( 1 9 7 8 )  HOPES THAT  

 SUCH INDEPENDENCE MIGHT BE IMMINENT HAD BEEN FRUSTRATED WHEN THE   UNITED STATES AND SOUTH AFRICA INSIS TED ON THE WITHDRAWAL OF CUBAN   TROOPS FROM ANGOLA AS A PRECONDITION. HEADS OF GOVERNMENT, REFLECTING THE VIEW OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE, FIRMLY  

 REJECTED ANY ATTEMPT TO LINK THE INDEPENDENCE OF NAMIBIA WITH THE   WITHDRAWAL OF CUBAN TROOPS. SOUTH AFRICA’ S OCCUPATION OF NAMIBIA IS   ILLEGAL, AND ACQUIESCENCE BY ANY MEMBER OF THE INTERNATIONAL  

 COMMUNITY I N  SOUTH AFRICA'S ATTEMPT TO UNDERMINE THE CENTRAL ROLE OF   THE UNITED NATIONS IN  THIS MATTER STRIKES AT THE FABRIC OF

 INTERNATIONAL ORDER. IN SUPPORT OF SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 539   ( 1 9 8 3 ) ,  HEADS OF GOVERNMENT URGED MEMBERS OF THE CONTACT GROUP TO   EXERCISE THEIR INFLUENCE TO SECURE THE SPEEDY AND UNCONDITIONAL   IMPLEMENTATION OF SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 4 3 5  ( 1 9 7 8 ) .  IF SOUTH   AFRICA CONTINUES TO OBSTRUCT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RESOLUTION 4 3 5  THE   AD'OPTKiN"OF APPROPRIATE MEASURES UNDER THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED  

 NATIONS WILL HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED.

 BY RECENT CHANGES IN SOUTH AFRICAN SPORT.

THEY ALSO NOTED WITH SATISFACTION THAT THE   COMMONWEALTH GAMES FEDERATION HAD AMENDED ITS CONSTITUTION TO ENABLE   IT TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS WITH REGARD TO THE GLENEAGLES   DECLARATION MORE EFFECTIVELY I N  FUTURE.

 18. IN THE CONTINUING STRUGGLE AGAINST THE EVIL SYSTEM OF APARTHEID   HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ATTACHED IMPORTANCE TO TAKING EFFECTIVE PUBLIC   RELATIONS MEASURES TO COUNTERACT SOUTH AFRICAN PROPAGANDA IN  CERTAIN   TARGET COUNTRIES BY DISSEMINATING THE TRUTH ABOUT APARTHEID AND ABCU   SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROGRESS IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES. TO THIS END THEY   REQUESTED THE SECRETARY-GENERAL TO CO-OPERATE WITH THE UNITED NATIONS   IN COLLECTING AND DISSEMINATING SUCH INFORMATION.

 19. HEADS OF GOVERNMENT REITERATED THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE EFFORTS OF THE MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT .   CO-ORDINATION CONFERENCE TO STRENGTHEN THEIR CO-OPERATION AND TO   REDUCE THEIR ECONOMIC DEPENDENCE ON SOUTH AFRICA. RECOGNISING THAT
