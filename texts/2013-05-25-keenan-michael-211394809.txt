 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling ALMOST 100 MORE PEOPLE ARRIVE  ILLEGALLY BY BOAT IN THE LAST 24  HOURS May 24, 2013

 The daily ferry service continues under Labor as another illegal boat carrying nearly 100 people was intercepted  overnight, Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Shadow Minister for Justice Customs and Border  Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “Already there have been more boats arrive than days in this month - 33 boats carrying 2439 people,” Mr Keenan said.

 “Over 35,000 people have arrived illegally by boat since Julia Gillard took over as Prime Minister - this is more than five  times the amount of people that arrived by boat under Kevin Rudd.

 “Yet Julia Gillard used the rate of boat arrivals as one of the main reasons to outs Kevin Rudd - by her own standard she  has failed to stop the crisis at our borders and in fact has only made it worse under her leadership. 

 “This is just another broken promise from the Gillard Government, who do not have the will or the resolve to put an end to  this insidious trade.

 “The Coalition will restore credibility to Australia’s border protection regime by returning to the suite of policies that worked  to stop people smuggling in the past,” Mr Keenan said.
