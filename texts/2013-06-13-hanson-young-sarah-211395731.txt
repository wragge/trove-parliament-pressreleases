 Media Release    

 Thursday, 13 June 2013    

 Denying refugees their right to work? That’s  just wrong    

 Refugees and asylum seekers in the Australian community must be given the right to  work, the Australian Greens have said.    

 “This government’s cruelty is creating an underclass of people whose only crime is  fleeing war and persecution,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young said.    

 “I will be moving a motion in the Senate on World Refugee Day next Thursday the 20th  of June, calling on the Parliament to recognise the right of refugees to work.   

 “I am calling on MPs from all sides who have expressed their concern over the  government’s No-Advantage rule to vote with their conscience on the motion.   

 “The No-Advantage rule has been a spectacular failure. It hasn't made anyone safer, it  hasn't saved lives at sea and has only caused more harm and suffering.    

 “Withholding work rights is hurting the people involved, hurting the Australian economy  and it quite clearly isn't stopping people form taking dangerous boat journeys.    

 “The Greens are standing up for vulnerable people in the Australian society who are  suffering at the hands of this Labor government, which is locked in a race to the bottom  with Tony Abbott.”
