 Media Statement  Thursday 27th September 2007

 

 SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT  Queensland Democrat Senator  QUEENSLAND’S ONLY INDEPENDENT VOICE IN THE SENATE 

 

 Deportation scandal shows need for independent Senate and  revised migration laws   

 

 Democrats' Deputy Leader Andrew Bartlett has slammed the federal government's secret deportation of  Papuan asylum seekers.    

 "Asylum seekers are not a political problem to be exploited or swept under the carpet.” Senator Bartlett said.   

 “This is an issue which raises humanitarian responsibilities that should be dealt with openly and fairly, not with  secrecy and unjust laws.    

 “The federal government's enthusiasm for operating under a veil of secrecy is the modus operandi for regimes  the world over who treat basic human rights as an optional extra which apply only when it is politically  convenient.    

 “The ability of Papua New Guinea to provide genuine safety for some West Papuans is seriously questionable,  and certainly should not be taken as a given in every instance without proper examination of the individual  circumstances.    

 “This is just one more example of why our unjust immigration laws need major reform.    

 “Only a Senate which is once again independent of the government of the day can provide the sort of scrutiny  needed to prevent this type of secret and unjust practice,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
