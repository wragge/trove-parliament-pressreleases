 Nation Welcomes Newest Citizens

 16 September 2005

 More than 1500 people will celebrate Australian Citizenship Day tomorrow by becoming citizens in ceremonies around  Australia.

 ‘Australian Citizenship Day was first introduced by this Government in 2001 as an opportunity for all Australians to  reflect upon the meaning and the importance of Australian citizenship,’ the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural  Affairs, John Cobb said today.

 ‘This year’s Australian Citizenship Day marks a milestone of five years, and I would encourage people who are already  Australian citizens to take part in the Australian Citizenship Day celebrations by participating in an affirmation ceremony,’  Mr Cobb said.

 ‘Affirmation ceremonies allow citizens to reaffirm their commitment to Australia and take part in the national celebration.

 ‘Our society is enriched by the diverse culture, language and customs of migrants and refugees who have come here from  all parts of the globe. The common bond that unites us all is citizenship,’ Mr Cobb said 

 ‘Australian Citizenship represents our shared values - acceptance, equality, freedom of speech and religion, the rule of  law, Parliamentary democracy, our Constitution and English as the national language.

 ‘It is also membership of the Australian family, said Mr Cobb.

 ‘Citizenship not only gives you the right to live in Australia, the right to apply for a passport, or the right to vote, it also  gives you the right to truly call yourself Australian. 

 ‘Australia has a unique and culturally diverse society. Our strength comes from our history of embracing new arrivals and  giving them the opportunity for themselves and their family to be the best that they can.

 ‘Australian Citizenship is the formal recognition of an individual’s commitment to Australia and Australian society.

 ‘I encourage all people who are eligible Australia-wide to take the final step and apply to become Australian citizens, said  John Cobb.
