 IMMIGRATION MINISTER ANNOUNCES 1992-93 GRANTS FUNDING  PROCESS

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, today announced the 1992-93 round of  funding to community organisations.

 "The arrangements are transitional pending consideration of  findings from the recent Ethnic Services Evaluation," Mr  Hand said.

 "To meet expectations arising from the annual funding cycle  I have decided, as a first step, to offer extensions of one  year only to those grants-in-aid holders whose funding  terminates on 31 March 1993 (see attached list). These 

 extensions will cost some $4 million in 1992-93.

 "Secondly, I have decided to invite ethnic and other  community organisations to propose ways of addressing the  needs identified during my community consultations last  year".

 The needs can be grouped under three headings:

 .  general settlement information;

 .  employment-related needs resulting from industrial  dislocation and

 .  advocacy in the area of unemployment-related stress and  its adverse effects on individuals and their families.

 Mr Hand said. that_heâlooked_forward_to_receiving proposaIs---which strike a balance between maintaining services for  newly-arrived migrants and refugees, while providing  services for longer-term residents within ethnic communities 

 and special-need groups such as women,  youth and middle-aged  men who are affected by the current recession and industry  restructuring.

 Some $2.6 million will be available to fund community  proposals with.one-year grants.

 Mr Hand said the transition process would move towards  needs-based funding, introducing for the first time a  network of Funding Advisory Committees comprising  representatives of Commonwealth and State/Territory funding  agencies.

 The Committees will advise on proposals that are not only  consistent with nationally-identified needs but also with  local applications of the Government's Access and Equity  policy.

 The Minister said that he planned to make final decisions on  the new grants by December 1992.
