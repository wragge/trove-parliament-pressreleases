 APPOINTMENTS TO ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL 

 Attorney-General Philip Ruddock today announced two new appointments and two  re-appointments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. 

 Mr Ruddock welcomed the Hon Dr Bruce McPherson CBE and the Hon Mr Robert  Nicholson AO as part-time Deputy Presidents to the Tribunal.   

 “Both appointments will bring considerable legal experience to the Tribunal,” Mr  Ruddock said. 

 Dr McPherson is a recently retired judge of the Queensland Court of Appeal and his  extensive judicial experience includes service as a Judge of Appeal on the High Court  of Solomon Islands and the Fiji Court of Appeal. 

 Mr Nicholson was a judge of the Federal Court of Australia and the Supreme Court  of Western Australia. He was a Deputy President of the Tribunal from 1986-88.  

 Mr Ruddock also congratulated Mr Julian Block on his re-appointment as a part time  Deputy President and Professor Graham Johnston AM as a part-time member of the  Tribunal. 

 “The Tribunal is fortunate to retain Mr Block and Professor Johnston as they have  demonstrated their ability to bring experience and dedication to the review of  administrative decisions.” 

 Mr Block, who was first appointed to the Tribunal in 1995, is a part-time judicial  member of the NSW Administrative Decisions Tribunal and an acting judge of the  NSW District Court.   

 Professor Johnston has been a member of the Tribunal since 1991 and brings  considerable expertise in chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology to the Tribunal.  

 The Administrative Appeals Tribunal provides independent review of a wide range  of administrative decisions made by the Australian Government. The new  appointments and re-appointments will enhance the Tribunal’s ability to provide a  mechanism of review that is fair, just, economical and quick.
