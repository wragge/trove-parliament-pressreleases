 Greens Reveal Crucial Cunningham Preferences

 The Greens will direct preferences to union independent Peter Wilson before Labor.

 “With 13 candidates standing in this by-election, the Greens believe it is important to tell the electorate where they stand on the policies of other candidates,” Michael Organ, Greens candidate for Cunningham, said today.

 “The only genuine progressive candidates who could win this election are the Greens and Peter Wilson, which is why we have given a clear second preference to Mr Wilson, whose union and community credentials are closest to our own.

 “The Greens will advocate for environmental sustainability, social and economic justice, grass roots democracy, and peace and non-violence, with vigour and integrity. “The Labor Party’s performance at all levels of government in the Illawarra has been abysmal and we have put them seventh.

 “Liberal Party member, David Moulds, standing as an Independent, has been placed eighth, because his public stand on refugees sees him squarely aligned with the lack of compassion and a ‘fair go’ shown by the policies of the Howard Government.

 “Both the Democrats, and ex-Democrat Meg Sampson, have also been preferenced in front of the Labor Party, along with Chris Williams of the Socialist Alliance and ex-Labor Party progressive James Keene,” Mr Organ said.

 “Other parties had been preferenced on their policy record including those on public education, health local environment issues, job protection and asylum seekers,” Greens Senator Bob Brown said in Wollongong today.

 “Labor has, however, directed preferences to the Liberal independent and Fred Nile's Christian Democrats before the Greens. Potential Labor voters will be dismayed that Fred Nile's bigoted policies and an effective Liberal party platform have been endorsed by Labor ahead of the Greens' progressive record.

 “Michael Organ and Peter Wilson are effectively swapping preferences and Labor's Fred Nile decision will lose them votes and Cunningham may well cause an upset on October 19th,” Senator Brown said.
