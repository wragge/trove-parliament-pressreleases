 AUSTRALIA'S CONTRIBUTION SECOND TO NONE

 The Minister for Immigration,  Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs,  Senator Robert Ray, said today that per head of  population, Australia accepted more refugees for permanent  resettlement than any other country in the world.

 Senator Ray â said that between 1975 and 1986, Australia had  accepted one refugee for each 116 residents, compared with a  ratio of 1/128 for Canada, 1/167 for Sweden, 1/214 for Denmark  and 1/221 for the United States.

 Launching the inaugural National Refugee Week at World Expo in  Brisbane, the Minister also said that in absolute terms,   Australia had one of the largest refugee intakes in the world and  all Australians could be proud of this fact.

 He said that in the coming year, Australia expected to resettle a  further 12 000 refugees and Special Humanitarian Program  migrants.

 "Since 1945 we have accepted 450 000 refugees and displaced  persons,  and since 1975 alone have resettled 175 000, of whom  over 110 000 have come from Indochina, in recognition of our  concern for this region," the Minister said.

 He said it was a serious indictment of our age that there were  currently about 12 million people throughout the world who had  been forced to flee their homelands,  and who were regarded as  refugees by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.

 "In addition to our resettlement program, we have been a generous  aid donor, providing about $160 million since 1980 through  Government funds,  as well as the direct contributions made by the  community through non-government organisations," Senator Ray  said.

 He said governments and international agencies put forward three  "durable solutions" to the world's refugee problems:

 - the safe repatriation of those who wish to return to their home  countries;

 - integration in countries of first refuge; and

 - third country resettlement (often the most difficult for  refugees because of the task of adapting to a different culture  and lifestyle).

 "While there are costs in running a sizeable refugee resettlement  program, there are also great benefits," the Minister said.

 "I believe that careful selection of refugees in need of  resettlement will ensure that the Australian community will  continue to support a refugee program, and we will ensure that  people will be able to rebuild their lives in peace and dignity.

 "This is a challenge to us all," he said.

 National Refugee Week is sponsored by two organisations -­ Australians Care for Refugees and the Refugee Council of  Australia —  in co-operatioan with the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees.

 It aims to promote greater awareness and understanding of the  position of refugees around the world and to improve the  acceptance and integration of those who are resettled in  Australia.
