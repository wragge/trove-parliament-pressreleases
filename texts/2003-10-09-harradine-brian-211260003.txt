 Chinese president should not address Parliament   

 Senator Brian Harradine has opposed the Government’s plans to have Chinese President  Hu Jintao address Australia’s Parliament because of his country’s appalling human rights  record.  Mr Hu will be asked to address Parliament on Friday, 24 October.   

 Speaking to the motion for the proposed address, Senator Harradine said “the Chinese  people continue to be oppressed by a one-party state.  It is not appropriate for the head of  a totalitarian state to have the honour of addressing a democratic parliament.”   

 “It’s time to stop being polite about the continuing horrific human rights abuses  continuing day-to-day in China.  The Australian Government has been pursuing polite  dialogue for decades with no effect.  Unfortunately when it comes to human rights, the  Government is constantly taking its eye off the ball as it sees the more attractive prospect  of big cash trade deals.”   

 Senator Harradine listed human rights abuses in China, including:   

 â¢ the jailing of Chinese labour leaders.  As recently as May, two Chinese labour  activists were convicted and sentenced to seven years and four years jail.  They had  organised thousands of sacked workers in a peaceful protest against the loss of their  jobs; 

 â¢ the continued oppression of Christians who refuse to be part of official Chinese  Government churches;  â¢ the continued oppression of members of Falun Gong;  â¢ the one-child policy which uses sterilisation, fines, imprisonment and other 

 punishments to force compliance, including forced abortion;  â¢ the arrest and forced repatriation of North Korean asylum-seekers;  â¢ continued restriction on freedom of expression, religion and association in Tibet; 

 and, 

 â¢ the execution of 150 people in June 2002 for drug-related crime to mark the UN  International Anti-Drugs Day on 26 June.   

 “It would be a sad day if we feted President Hu in this democratically elected chamber”,  Senator Harradine said.   

 Senator Harradine is a member of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing  Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.
