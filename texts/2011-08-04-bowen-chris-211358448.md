 UniSA Conference:  From refugee to citizen   

 Keynote address

 ***CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY***  

 

 

 Introduction   

 Thank you for inviting me here today, I am particularly pleased to have the  opportunity to reflect on the topic of today’s seminar - from Refugee to Citizen.    

 I’d like to thank Nicholas Proctor for the invitation to be here today. More  importantly, I’d like to thank you for the vital work you do on CISSR and all the  other interactions you have with us on asylum seeker, refugee and settlement  issues.   

 Unfortunately Kate Lundy, my Parliamentary Secretary, could not make it here  today. As you know, Kate has day to day responsibility for settlement policy - a  role she brings great passion and commitment to.  I know many of you value the good working relationship you have with Kate, and  for those who haven’t had contact with her I would certainly encourage you to.  She is a great listener and a passionate advocate on settlement issues.   

 Ensuring successful settlement for all our migrants - especially our humanitarian  and refugee intake - is something that has long been important to me.    

 Growing up in multicultural Western Sydney, I’ve always been struck by the  abilities, talents and cultural richness of our fellow Australians who came here as  humanitarian migrants and refugees. 

 

 Of course, making sure every support is given to make sure every individual can  grow to their full potential is important to those individuals and should also be  regarded as important to our society and our nation.    

 The title of this Conference is “Transition, From Refugee to Citizen”.    

 As a local councillor, mayor, Member of Parliament, and now Minister for  Immigration, I’ve been privileged to attend hundreds of citizenship ceremonies.   

 The pledge of citizenship, which only takes a few short moments, acknowledges  a lifelong undertaking - it is the emotional commitment that accompanies the  physical act of relocating.    

 To my mind, this makes citizenship a key indicator of the success of our  migration program and a measurable outcome of settlement.    

 Australia has the second highest rates of citizenship in the OECD, only slightly  lower than Canada and more than 20 percentage points higher than the OECD  average.    

 More than 65 per cent of migrants take up citizenship and, if you include only  those who have been here for more than 10 years, the figure climbs to 80 per  cent.    

 For humanitarian entrants, the figure is higher still with 91 per cent taking up  citizenship.    

 Indeed, in a recent survey of 8,500 refugees and humanitarian entrants  commissioned by my department, 99 per cent of respondents indicated that they  intended to become Australian citizens.    

 A protection visa offers safety, but to seek citizenship is to seek more - it is a  life-long commitment to Australia.   

 It is a commitment born from optimism - it reflects a confidence that Australia  will offer opportunities and a chance to belong, a belief that difference will not  translate into disadvantage.    

 It is a decision made in the context our commitment to multiculturalism and our  settlement services.    

 I would like to take this opportunity to speak to you about settlement services  and the role they play in the path to citizenship.    

 Australia has been a world leader in developing a set of services to support new  refugees and migrants in settling into a new culture and country.    

 History of Settlement Services    

 Our settlement services are generally regarded as being the best in the world -  and they probably are. But that does not mean that they are perfect: far from it.    

 Today I’ll talk about some of the changes the Government has already made and  some of the things that Kate and I are working on.    

 There are some who argue that we should not increase our humanitarian intake  because humanitarian migrants do face challenges to overcome to become fully  participatory residents and citizens.    

 I strongly disagree. I’m glad that this year we’re able to increase our  humanitarian intake to 14,750. Over time, I think we can, as a nation, take more  refugees. But we do need to link this with continual monitoring and improvement  of our settlement services.    

 Trends in Settlement Services   

 Settlement programs are constantly evolving - each wave of migration has  unique needs and necessitates a different profile of services.    

 There are some long-term trends worth noting as well has some more recent  policy decisions with significant implications.    

 Firstly, the delivery of services has shifted from the public service to the  community sector.    

 In devolving settlement services to community organisations, the Government  created a sector. A sector that is highly flexible and well positioned to respond to  emerging needs.    

 But this restructure also created a separation between policy development and  direct service experience, and placed significant duty of care obligations on small  agencies. Consequently it has necessitated a need for the department to focus  on contract management and feedback mechanisms to ensure there is no gulf in  communication.    

 Secondly, funding has become more contestable. The introduction of competitive  tendering had a profound impact on the settlement sector.    

 We know that as a specialist sector charged with the coordination of local 

 services, competition has proved challenging.    

 Finally, access to MRC services has become more prescriptive and some core  services have been delivered through project grants.   

 This has tended to reduce the capacity of MRCs to operate what they consider  core services and has diluted settlement funding.    

 An Investment in Settlement   

 Since coming to power, this Government has made significant enhancements to  the initial services offered to humanitarian entrants.    

 Changes include a more comprehensive case management focus, with particular  attention on the development of employment and education pathways.    

 For the first time, the new program will see the introduction of a structured  onshore cultural orientation program, covering topics such as Australian values  and laws, budgeting and nutrition, and the health and education systems.    

 Coordination with other local services and the development of connections with  other community members has been strengthened.    

 And also included is greater focus on the needs of young refugees and more  flexibility in housing options.    

 The changes, currently being implemented, follow a nationwide consultation  process with newly arrived refugees and service providers.   

 Alongside the implementation of the new program, I announced a review of  contract management practices in the department, following the well-known and  unacceptable difficulties with service providers in Newcastle.   

 Programs only work if there is a genuine and open dialogue between the sector  and the department and there are clear mechanisms to access outcomes.    

 

 What’s being done to improve Settlement Services;   

 Settlement information and orientation services have been enhanced through  new HSS on-shore services and the introduction of a specialised ‘settlement  course’ in the AMEP.   

 A new AMEP business model has been implemented which provides:  â¢ a new case management approach provided by an AMEP counsellor, 

 â¢ guidance for clients on pathways to employment,   â¢ additional ESL training and education after they finish the AMEP  â¢ a new self paced e-learning option providing free unlimited access to extra  English language tuition hours via the internet, and  â¢ incentives for service providers to attract and retain clients.    

 Our understanding of the factors impacting on migrant/humanitarian  employment outcomes will be improved through new client data sharing  arrangements between DIAC and DEEWR which will enable a range of key new  research projects to be undertaken.   

 In relation to accommodation support:   

 Under the new HSS case management approach clients receive accommodation  support throughout the HSS, including:  â¢ education on navigating the housing system and managing rental affairs;   â¢ clients are assessed to ensure they are not at risk of homelessness; and will  not be exited from the program until their accommodation situation is stabilised.   Generalist SGP providers also help clients source long term accommodation, and  a small number of specialist SGP providers offer one-on-one intensive  accommodation assistance.   

 A pilot extending free interpreting services to real estate agents aims to improve  their engagement with clients  The FAHCSIA community based Reconnect program provides early intervention  for homeless and at risk youth and their families   

 Youth initiatives include:   

 a focus on humanitarian youth in the new HSS program,   â¢ funding under the Diversity and Social Cohesion Program (DSCP) for a  nationally coordinated approach to advocacy for multicultural youth issues  through the Multicultural Youth Advocacy Network(MYAN) to improve transition  between settlement programs and mainstream services, and  â¢ the creation in DIAC of a Community Services and Children’s Division to  coordinate and address complex issues relating to minors, particularly  Unaccompanied Humanitarian minors.   

 

 Future Directions in Settlement   

 In recent years, 50 per cent of the Refugee and Special Humanitarian Category  intake have been under-25.   

 I have asked my colleague, Senator Lundy, to work with the department to 

 consider whether better settlement outcomes for young refugees can be  achieved.    

 The aim would be to test a new approach to settlement services for refugee  youth that recognises their ability to transition to living independently.    

 This would include providing older unaccompanied humanitarian minors without  identified carers with youth-focused settlement services (including housing).   

 Combined with the work of the Multicultural Youth Advocacy Network, this will  help us to provide a stable, supportive and youth focused model for the provision  of settlement services to young refugees.    

 This in turn will minimise the chances of them not adjusting to their new life, and  ending up dependant on the welfare, or coming into contact with the criminal  justice system.    

 I have also asked Senator Lundy to work on refocusing the Settlement Grants  Programs to ensure broader services are meeting the needs of clients.    

 The MRC network began a period of sustained investment in the infrastructure of  settlement - in the development of specialised services.    

 Settlement is an expert service that necessitates skills and requires community  connections built over years, not months.    

 The process of settlement carries across the full spectrum of social services; it  involves housing, education, health care, welfare and law.    

 To be effective, settlement must operate both at an individual level and at the  community level.    

 The role of settlement is threefold; it assists individuals to participate fully in  Australian society, it connects Government to new communities and it  coordinates local services to support integration.    

 Senator Lundy will be consulting broadly with the sector in developing new  directions.    

 Our migration program cannot simply operate to calibrate numbers to industry  needs and there is more to our humanitarian program than a protection visa.    

 Settlement services are the backbone of migration - they enhance the  productivity of the program and support communities in transition.    

 They also sit at the core of our humanitarian program - they open the path to  full and meaningful citizenship.   

 The Hugh Report   

 In his report, Professor Hugo (Adelaide Uni - a local boy) finds that, despite their  traumatic experiences prior to coming to Australia, refugees and humanitarian  entrants make a significant and unique contribution to the Australian community.   

 Refugees provide a demographic dividend to Australia, as they have the  youngest age profile of all migrant groups and have the largest proportion of  dependent-age children, who will be educated in Australia. This is important  when you consider the demographic challenge of an ageing Australia.   

 There is evidence of increased settlement in non-metropolitan areas, creating  social and economic benefits for rural and regional communities.   

 With an increased focused on regional settlement, around 20 per cent of  humanitarian entrants have settled in regional areas. This is up from 10.9 per  cent in 2004-05 and 17.5 per cent in 2009-10.   

 Professor Hugo acknowledges, as does the Government, that employment and  participation by humanitarian entrants is low in the short-term.   

 Given the cultural, language and economic barriers humanitarian entrants face,  as well as the traumatic experience of fleeing persecution, this is hardly  surprising.   

 Institutional barriers to workforce participation - such as a lack of contacts, local  experience or recognised qualifications - invariably make getting a job all the  more difficult.   

 We know that work is a great reflection of successful Settlement. We know that  getting work is for many newly arrived and refugees to Australia the key to  building a future for them and their families.    

 That is why we have made reforms to the AMEP and increased the focus on  regional settlement.   

 Professor Hugo’s research shows us that a resilient spirit and a desire to succeed  are common characteristics of humanitarian entrants.   

 Again, this is something I’ve noted growing up in, and representing multicultural  Western Sydney.   Refugees and their children are often hungry for success - keen and passionate 

 to make the most of the educational and entrepreneurial opportunities available  to them, as they should be.   

 We want to give people the best start possible for their new lives in Australia.    

 Conclusion   

 Having faced the darkest acts of humanity, refugees hold the finest of human  ambitions, the desire to provide their children with the protections they  themselves could not take for granted.  

 

 What Australia offers is more than safety and more than protection - it offers  belonging.    

 Thank you for the work you do in providing that belonging. And together, let’s  work to continue to improve our settlement services so that every refugee  resettled in Australia grows to be the fine Australian they can be.
