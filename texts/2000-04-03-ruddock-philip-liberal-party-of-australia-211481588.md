 Humanitarian Intake for 2000-2001  

 MPS 035/2000 

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today announced that Australia's Humanitarian Program intake for 2000-2001 will be 12,000.

 The Minister said that in addition to the 12,000 places, the program will be supplemented by any unused places rolled over from the 1999-2000 program. This will give the Minister the management flexibility to meet the pressures placed on the system by the increase in unauthorised boat arrivals. 

 "The increase in unauthorised boat arrivals to Australia in recent months has placed great pressure on the capacity of Australia to assist with resettlement of people in need overseas," Mr Ruddock said. 

 "It is my hope that we will be able to increase the number of places available offshore. However, this will depend on the number of people claiming asylum onshore." 

 The Minister explained that there will be an estimated 4,000 places for Refugees and 4,000 for Special Humanitarian Program and Special Assistance Category combined. However, places not required onshore could be used offshore.

 "The Humanitarian Program is designed to help victims of human rights abuses who may not have any other option than to be resettled," Mr Ruddock said.

 "The Government is committed to delivering an effective and well-targeted Humanitarian Program that puts the resettlement needs of genuine refugees first. In response to this goal and the continuing decline in the number of people sponsored under the Special Assistance Categories, I have decided to close all the remaining Special Assistance Categories during 2000-2001."

 The Minister said that Australia, along with a small number of other resettlement countries, continues to be a major participant in global refugee resettlement. This has been highlighted not only by the provision of temporary safe haven to Kosovo Albanians and East Timorese, but Australia's preparedness to provide ongoing support in refugee situations in other parts of the world. 

 "Our commitment in this area has often been commended by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees," Mr Ruddock said.

 The offshore Humanitarian Program will be made up of three categories:

 Refugee: 4,000 places have been allocated for people who meet requirements based on the United Nations Convention definition of a refugee and who have been identified in

 conjunction with UNHCR as in need of resettlement; 

 Special Humanitarian Program (SHP) and Special Assistance Category (SAC): 4,000 places have been allocated for those subject to discrimination amounting to gross violation of human rights and who have strong support from an Australian citizen or resident or a community group in Australia and to finalise those applications under SAC currently on hand which are at an advanced stage of processing. Allocations in both these categories will be subject to ongoing monitoring for any further dramatic shifts in onshore arrivals likely to present successful asylum claimants.

 "Priority in the offshore Humanitarian Program will continue to be given to the regions of the former Yugoslavia, the Middle East, South West Asia and Africa," Mr Ruddock said.
