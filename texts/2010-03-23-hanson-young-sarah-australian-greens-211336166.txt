  Ombudsman Must Investigate Christmas Island 

  

  

  The Australian Greens have called for an urgent review of conditions and processing times for  asylum seekers on Christmas Island to provide a picture of the realities of detention, according to  Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young. 

  Senator Hanson-Young, Greens spokesperson on Immigration and Human Rights, says the  Commonwealth Ombudsman should conduct the review as a matter of urgency, as his powers  already allow him to investigate conditions and monitor the processing of claims. She says this  special review must be reported to Parliament, with a requirement that the Minister for Immigration  responds within 15 days. 

  "We know that the numbers of asylum seekers on the island are growing, and people are being  detained for longer and longer periods of time,'' Senator Hanson-Young said. 

  "Unfortunately, the Federal Government's only response has been to desperately pitch tents to avoid  an overflow of asylum seekers being brought to the mainland. 

  "It's time for somebody aside from the Minister to investigate and report back to Parliament. A  response should be required from the Minister within 15 days, rather than allowing things to slide  beyond the Federal Election. 

  "The Government still supports offshore processing, while the Coalition's latest appalling suggestion  is detaining people on floating prison ships. Neither approach works - an independent assessment  would inform the Government and lead to a better way forward. 

  "If the Government has not acted by May, I will move when Parliament returns to change the  Ombudsman Act and the Migration Act to extend the powers to guarantee this review is made public  with a required Government response.'' 

  The call for an investigation comes after the release of the UNHCR report into asylum seeker  application numbers around the world. 

  "The Coalition's response to this report shows again that they are focused on fearmongering. The  largest group of claims is actually from Chinese nationals who arrived by plane, not boat. 

  "Australia takes less than 2 per cent of global asylum claim numbers - despite the hype, we don't  have a crisis, but we have an urgent need to find a better way to manage the issue.''
