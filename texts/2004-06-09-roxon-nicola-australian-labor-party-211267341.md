 LEGAL AID REPORT HIGHLIGHTS  GRAVE INJUSTICES   

 Grave injustices in access to legal aid funding and access to justice were identified  throughout the system and across the country in a report tabled by the Senate Legal and  Constitutional Committee yesterday.   

 More than 100 submissions highlighted problems that had developed since the Howard  Government slashed legal aid funding and introduced changes to the funding formula  back in 1997.   

 Despite being warned of the major impact this would have on ordinary Australians  receiving access to legal assistance, the Government has repeatedly refused to return to a  co-operative funding model with the States and Territories.   

 Women involved in family law matters, particularly those involving domestic violence or  child abuse, face significant disadvantage in gaining access to adequate legal assistance.   

 One of the recommendations (14) calls on the Government to increase as a matter of  urgency the level of funding available for family law matters, and another (22) asks that  legal representation be made available to all family law disputes involving allegations of  domestic violence or child abuse.   

 If the Government is serious about saying no to violence against women, it must  immediately address these and other recommendations related to family law matters.   

 Other groups that miss out significantly include Indigenous Australians, people living in  regional, rural and remote communities, migrants and refugees, the homeless, mentally ill,  and young people.   

 Lack of growth funding for the Community Legal Centres has also resulted in a funding  crisis for many services, with the recent budget delivering not a single cent to assist in  problems with recruiting and retaining skilled and experienced lawyers.   

 The 63 recommendations in the report demand immediate attention from the Attorney-General to our domestic legal system.  Australian families cannot wait until after an  election for justice to be delivered.
