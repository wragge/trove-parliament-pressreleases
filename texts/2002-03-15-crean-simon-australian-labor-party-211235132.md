 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 15TH MARCH 2002.

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 Subjects: Government in crisis, Senator Heffernan and Wayne Carey.

 CREAN: We’re just completed three weeks of the sitting of the new Parliament and we’ve seen in every one of those weeks a Government in crisis every day. The ‘Kids Overboard’ affair and the deceit associated with it; a Treasurer asleep at the roulette wheel; a Governor-General’s Office diminished; Bill Heffernan making allegations and the Prime Minister failing to act. A Government in crisis day by day. A Government with a Prime Minister that says that he wasn’t told. This is the Sergeant Shultz of Australian politics masquerading as Prime Minister. Now the country deserves better but the Opposition will continue to put forward constructive initiatives as we did in terms of asylum seekers this week and forced the capitulation by the Government in terms of its so called ‘Pacific Solution’. It’s run up the white flag on the ‘Pacific Solution’ a solution that was flawed from the beginning and for which the Government still has not got a lasting solution. I hope out of this week they’re genuine in their preparedness to sit down with us and work through for a lasting solution.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean the Prime Minister’s sort of had a fairly, you know at the last election had a fairly emphatic win and of course he would have expected to be around a lot longer. Do you think because of the poor start he should be reconsidering his future?

 CREAN: Well look the Prime Minister has no third term agenda and that’s because they didn’t go to the election with one. It’s the reason the Parliament is not sitting much at all and it’s the reason the Government continues to find itself in crisis because it thinks it can manage these things on a day to day basis. But all it does is to go from crisis to crisis. Now remember what was being said at the beginning of this year? The Government had won, Labor was on the back foot, Labor would be skewered, they’d introduce industrial laws, the unfair dismissals laws, they’d bring in the terrorism bills, the asylum seekers bills. This was all designed to embarrass

 2

 Labor. What have we had? The IR bills have been put off, the terrorism bills have been put off and they’ve capitulated on the asylum seekers bills. And in all of this there agenda is in tatters, whatever agenda they had, they certainly didn’t have a positive agenda, but their negative agenda is now in tatters because they’re a Government in crisis.

 JOURNALIST: Have you called the Prime Minister’s bluff in that he either knew what Heffernan was going to do so is he’s complicit or he’s been defied by his Cabinet Secretary who he must sack?

 CREAN: Well John Howard told us that he had counselled Heffernan from making the allegations in the Senate. That counselling has been defied. On that standard alone the Prime Minister must sack Heffernan. If he doesn’t sack him one can only conclude that he’s prepared to have and encourage this issue to run. Now that’s a Prime Minister that is prepared to condone his Parliamentary Secretary continuing to make allegations without further evidence about a High Court Judge. An Attorney-General that refuses to express confidence in a member of the judiciary, of the High Court. This is not just an attack on a man, this is an attack on the institution and this is what John Howard is condoning. Now apart from the sacking of Heffernan what John Howard has to do today is to express confidence in Mr Justice Kirby. His Attorney-General refused to do it the Prime Minister must.

 JOURNALIST: What does that say about Williams?

 CREAN: What that says about Williams is he’s weak. In any other circumstances the Attorney-General, the chief law officer of the land would have to express confidence in a judge unless there was compelling evidence to the contrary. We know that there is no evidence against Mr Justice Kirby. We know it because the evidence that Heffernan put forward was rejected by the police and rejected by a Royal Commission. So what is John Howard and Daryl Williams saying? They don’t have confidence in the NSW Police? They don’t have confidence in the Royal Commissioner? They accept Bill Heffernan’s version of events that’s been rejected by other people? I mean this is an outrage. It’s not just Heffernan that the Prime Minister must sack, the Prime Minister’s got to stand up for the institutions in this country, not attack them.

 JOURNALIST: Is this ‘dog whistle’ stuff?

 CREAN: Look the Prime Minister’s tactics in terms of allowing these things to happen is what is at issue here. He cannot continue to get away with this notion that he did not know. The Sergeant Shultz of Australian politics masquerading as a Prime Minister. The nation deserves better.

 JOURNALIST: What does it say about the Senate Mr Crean that they can’t or they have no power or that they have no willingness to discipline

 3

 Senator Heffernan when he’s refusing to comply with an order that he apologise?

 CREAN: Look the disciplining of Senator Heffernan isn’t just up to the Senate. It’s up to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister must sack him. It’s the Prime Minister whose judgment continues to be found wanting. If he’s not prepared to act you can only conclude he’s condoning it. He’s allowing a Parliamentary Secretary to make unwarranted allegations under Privilege of Parliament where there is no evidence for it. A Prime Minister can’t condone that particularly where he admits that he counselled against it. What sort of leadership is that? Counsels against it, allows it to happen and does nothing? This is a weak Prime Minister but maybe it’s a Prime Minister that just wants the issue to run.

 JOURNALIST: Do you want those fines and prison terms are they the sorts of sanctions you want to see imposed on Senator Heffernan?

 CREAN: The sanction is dismissal. It’s simple, it’s dismissal. He’s defied the Prime Minister and he continues to make allegations for which there is no evidence. You cannot run politics from a unilateral perspective. There has to be respect for the institutions, there has to be respect for the law enforcement agencies. You can’t have a circumstance in which Heffernan snubs his nose says I don’t agree with the NSW Police, I don’t agree with the Royal Commissioner. I know it all and I’ll say it under Parliamentary Privilege. That’s an outrage and the Prime Minister must step in and act.

 JOURNALIST: What of the apparent divisions that are emerging in the Coalition ranks?

 CREAN: Well you see that will…this is the interesting development here. This is not just me saying the Prime Minister is acting wrongly, it’s a large number of his own party. One abstained from the vote yesterday and that saw the majority in the Senate demanding the apology. This is a Liberal Party internally riven because you’ve got a one man band, a person that believes he alone won the last election and he doesn’t care about probity. He’s prepared to allow these attacks on institutions, on individuals to run and do nothing to prevent them.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, Wayne Carey this morning in the papers made a fairly fulsome apology for his behaviour. Do you think given that, that the community should go easy on him a little bit?

 CREAN: Well there are many victims out of this and it’s going to need more than apologies, it’s going to require a lot of healing. I think the apology’s important but I think that there’s got to be a lot of rebuilding. A lot of lives have been shattered. Anthony Stevens in particular and it’s a great tragedy when these sorts of things happen and I think it highlights the importance of mateship, of teamship, all of that goes with it. But if you abuse

 it you pay a heavy price and that’s an important lesson for the community at large.

 JOURNALIST: Given your position, can I ask you where your sympathies lie?

 CREAN: Well my sympathies are with the victims. I mean there are a lot of people whose lives have been shattered and hurt. I feel very sorry for them.

 JOURNALIST: Is Wayne Carey a victim?

 CREAN: Of course he is, he’s a victim but he’s also part of the cause and it’s these circumstances in which you’ve got to have regard for the circumstances, try and recognise it, recognise that it’s a difficult circumstance but get on with it. There’s got to be a lot of healing but the team itself I think has taken the right approach and I wish it well. I’m confident it can rebuild.

 JOURNALIST: Would you take a call from him, if he called and asked your advice?

 CREAN: Absolutely. I might be prepared to make it myself but not just to him, to Anthony as well. Because I think Anthony’s the one that’s probably hurting the most. I wish him well because he’s a great player. He’s a bloke that, well, he almost got cut in half with an accident. This incident has just cut him up and he’s the one people have got to get behind significantly.

 JOURNALIST: Will the Kangaroos survive?

 CREAN: Yeah of course the Kangaroos will survive. They’re a great team and they’ve been written off many times before. Don’t write them off, they’ll be playing well.

 JOURNALIST: Have you been signing up your backbenchers?

 CREAN: I’ll take them along to as many games as they want to come. I’m always proud to display them. They get a bit embarrassed by my over exuberance in barracking for them though but I’m looking forward to the, I can’t get to first game because it’s over in Adelaide, but I‘ll be at the second one. In fact I was down at the practice game last Saturday between the Kangaroos and St Kilda and little did I know, well no one knew that that’d be the last time any of us would see Carey playing in a Kangaroos jumper. It’s a great tragedy for him, it’s a great tragedy for the club it’s a great tragedy for the game. He’s the best player I’ve ever seen kick a ball and it’s just tragic the way he goes out of it.

 JOURNALIST: So can I just clarify something, you’re willing to offer yourself as a mediator if that…

 5

 CREAN: No, no look let’s not read too much into this. I have had a lot of issues on my plate this week and the most distracting and disturbing one has been what’s happened at the Kangaroos but it’s not something that I’m directly involved in. I feel for the Club, I feel for the players. I love the club and I want it to do well. If there’s any way I can assist I will, but I’m not pretending that I have any magic solutions for this one. I’ve got a job to do but I’m prepared to participate constructively in any way people want us to.

 JOURNALIST: Have you spoken to Justice Kirby or would you call him?

 CREAN: No I don’t think it’s appropriate to speak to the Justice directly. But I have tried in the public statements that I’ve made to indicate my confidence in him but to indicate as well that with everyone, if people have allegations, if people have evidence, put them forward to the appropriate authorities. But in particular here where that evidence has been rejected, the attack from Heffernan is outrageous and the Prime Minister has to act to sack him.

 JOURNALIST: What would you expect NSW police to do when they finally receive the documents?

 CREAN: Well it’s up to the police but I mean what’s outrageous about this is that two days ago we’re told that evidence has been sent to the NSW Police but it’s not new evidence and then it hadn’t been received by Commissioner Ryan? Even though it had been tabled in the Parliament the day before it was not received by Commissioner Ryan the next day. So where is it? Lost in the mail? Another one of the Prime Minister’s excuses. So what do they have to do? They have to say oh we’ve got some new evidence but it still hasn’t been sent. I mean this is Heffernan condoned by the Prime Minister pretending there is an issue where there’s no evidence. Now he either puts up or shuts up but significantly to date, because he hasn’t put up, the Prime Minster must sack him.

 ENDS.
