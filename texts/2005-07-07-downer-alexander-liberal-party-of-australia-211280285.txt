 Minister for Foreign Affairs

 Doorstop Interview - Sydney 

 Downer: (inaudible) Xanana Gusmao that I first  met him in the Jakarta prison in I think  January 1999 and it's an extraordinary thing  really the way he's gone from being a prisoner  of the Indonesians in 1999 to being the  President of East Timor. And a lot has  happened which would lead to that translation  but I think he has done a great job to lead his  people in the way he's done it. And so always a  pleasure for me to se him I know him well.

 Journalist: Can we ask what you discussed?

 Downer: Well we discussed quite a few things.  We discussed obviously the bilateral  relationship. We're happy with the oil and gas  negotiations and hope that we will be able to  sign off on that very soon. And as far as our  aid program is concerned we're going to  continue to maintain a strong aid program to  East Timor. We particularly raised some of the  health issues there, the shortages of eye  doctors for example and I'm going to have a  look and see if there is more that we can do in  that area. And we talked about relations of  our new neighbours, obviously with Indonesia  and other countries and you know the thing  about President Gusmao is that he's  understood the importance of building a good  relationship with Indonesia despite the history  of their relationship and President Yudhoyono  shares that view. So we've been very  encouraged by the way the relationship has  been developing.

 Journalist: There were reports today that East  Timor would receive about $13 billion dollars  from the gas and (inaudible). Can you confirm  that?

 Downer: Well you couldn't really, you can only  provide indicative figures because the amount  of money that East Timor will get from oil and  gas developments in the Timor Sea will  depend very substantially on what happens to  oil and gas prices and how the market evolves  over many, many years. So we don't really  know but I mean obviously East Timor is going  to do very well out of the oil and gas in the  Timor Sea. That's going to provide an  important foundation for the country. But I  would make this point - there are a lot of  countries in the world that have got a lot of  revenue from oil and gas and some of them  have become rich and by the way some of  them haven't and the thing about East Timor is  we've often spoken to them about how they  look after the money - making sure it is  properly set aside, that the money goes into a  trust. And I'm very impressed with the  commitment made not only by President  Gusmao but also by Prime Minister Alkatiri and  other ministers, very impresses with their  commitment to make sure that they look after  the revenues that they get from the Timor Sea  because you know it potentially provides a  foundation for East Timor's economy but it will 

 only provide a strong and sustainable  foundation if the money is properly looked  after.

 Journalist: (inaudible) ball park figure, I  understand that you can't commit to that  exact figure.

 Downer: I'm not going to get into particular  figures. I mean they will do very well out of it  and when it comes to - I'm not trying to be  cute about this when it comes to the signing  ceremony of the agreement between Australia  and East Timor we'll obviously publish all the  details of it then. And people can make their  own calculations but short of a complete  collapse of the oil and gas market - and I think  oil prices hit $61 yesterday so a new record -  so that seems highly unlikely. They'll obviously  get many billions of dollars but over a long  period of time, I mean over more than 20  years.

 Journalist: On the Afghanistan deployment,  (inaudible) can we do that Afghanistan  deployment without withdrawing any troops  from Iraq? Do we have the capability?

 Downer: Obviously we would have the  capability, yes. Of course we would. We have  only have 1300, 1400 troops actually in Iraq I  mean we have a defence force which a  massively bigger than that. I know Mr Beazley  is saying that any excuse to cut and run from  Iraq. You know what I'd say to the cut and run  school which the Labor Party and some  elements from the politics left of Australia are  part of but not all elements - the last thing  you would want to do, the last thing you  would want to do is to give a victory to the  insurgents, the sort of people of took Douglas  Wood hostage, to al-Qaida terrorists. The last  thing you would want to do would be to turn  your back on the millions and millions of Iraqis  who went out to vote in January and who  support a peaceful and democratic transition  of their country.  It would be the worst  imaginable thing for Australia to do, I don't  think Australia should contemplate that. But  that doesn't have any bearing on what we  could do in Afghanistan. I mean we'll make a  decision about that but it's not contingent on  any changes to our, this debate is not  contingent on any changes to our  commitments in Iraq.

 Journalist: (inaudible) 

 Downer: With the greatest of respect think  about that question. I mean we have what how  many in the army? We have about 40, 000 in  the army, (inaudible) includes civilians. Well  look you'll hear much more about it from us  nearer the time. We haven't made a decision. 

 Journalist: The Prime Minister says that he has  spoken to you and Senator Hill, and what's  your view on sending troops to Afghanistan?

 Downer: Well I know the Prime Minister's view,  I know Senator Hill's view and it won't come to  you as a remarkable revelation but I have my  own strongly held view about this. And we'll  sit down very soon and formalise a position.  But obviously we all know each others views.

 Journalist: Can you tell us your strong held  view?

 Downer: No. You will hear eventually what it  is.

 Journalist:  A member of Schapelle Corrby's  legal team today has accused the Prime 

 Minister of lying over the level of help the  government has been providing. Has the  government been doing enough to help them  gather evidence?

 Downer: Well I think you will find that Senator  Ellison yesterday put out a very  comprehensive press release, a three page  press release on the assistance that the  Australian Government has given to Schapelle  Corby and her legal team. The main thing is  that the legal team instead of attacking the  Prime Minister of Australia focuses on the  appeals court, focuses on the Bali High Court.  Attacking John Howard isn't going to help with  the defence of Schapelle Corby. What's going  to help is the defence team focusing on the  case it will put to the high court. And you  know, we have 150 or so Australians who are  in prison overseas and we do what we can to  help those people. In every case they have a  defence team and the defence team have to  put the case to the court. We have other  Australians who have been charged and are  before courts overseas and similarly we will  provide information to the defence team if we  have the information. But you know sadly if 

 we don't have the absolute proof of someone's  innocence, if we just don't have the material  we can't provide it. Or to put it another way,  there is no point in us trying to fabricate  material which doesn't, which we don't have.  Whether it exists or not I don't know but we  don't have the information. We will provide  information that we do have to the defence  teams of Australians in trouble and who are  before the courts overseas, including  Schapelle Corby obviously. 

 Journalist: (inaudible) Schapelle Corby much  more (inaudible)?

 Downer: Well they've asked for much more  assistance that is normally the case and we've  tried to be as responsive and as positive as we  can. I mean we have the case for example, I  that just comes to the top of my head- Mr  Halloran who is, his case is going to appeal in  Sierra Leone very son. We've been providing  every assistance we can for him. We have  several cases of Australians who are appearing  before courts or will soon appear before  courts in relation to drugs charges and again  we try to provide what assistance we can. But 

 in every single case we - from Schapelle Corby  through to all of the others - unless we have  information which is absolutely going to clear  them there is not a lot more that we can do.  And in Schapelle Corby's case as I've said  before we do not have the silver bullet which  is going to spring her from jail, that's a case  that has to be made by the defence team and  we obviously provide them with information  that they ask for. And so far as we can obtain  information.

 Journalist: Is there a government policy that  any convicted drug smuggler who wants it that  we find (inaudible)?

 Downer: Well it's not as simple as that. In the  case of Indonesia, and this doesn't apply to  every country, we have a mutual assistance  treaty and so we act in accordance with the  treaty. I mean if Schapelle Corby, if we use  her as an example, if Schapelle Corby's team  wish to have an Australian witness present to a  court in Bali then they should make an  applications to the Indonesian Government,  then the Indonesian Government will then ask  us. This is the way that the mutual assistance 

 agreement works and if they are to do that we  would obviously be happy to help. Excepting  to say this that under our law we can't force  someone to appear as a witness in a foreign  court, can't force them to but we can  encourage them to. Now in the case of John  Ford he agreed to do it. 

 Journalist: Mr Downer on another topic, the  Chinese Ambassador has spoken to three  different business groups in the last few day,  (inaudible) Australian media saying that  they...

 Downer:...attacking the media?

 Journalist: ... also economic ties with  Australia and has also called for the Australian  Government and the Australian people to keep  out of internal Chinese affairs. Do you see  these as thinly veiled threats (inaudible)  Australia much keep quiet on human rights  abuses?

 Downer: We've been doing business with China  for years and years, nothing has changed in  the fact that we do business with China. I  mean the Australian Governments not just our 

 government has been doing business with  China since December I think it was 1972 and  we'll continue to do so. Look we have our  differences with China obviously this is a  robust liberal democracy with a very free  press, China has a quite different political  system and we have to operate our  relationships within those constraints. That's  why we have a human rights dialogue with  China, we don't have a position where we are  uncritical of China on Human rights issues. We  are very directly established with them a  human rights dialogue and we also of course  from time to time take up issues with China  and the media and others here in Australia are  entitled to express their views about China  because we have a free press.

 Journalist: They're fairly testy words from a  foreign diplomat in Australia. What do you  think has making her so upset with the ay  things in China are being portrayed here?

 Downer: Well look I haven't, I read something  that she said I think in Melbourne from the  ABC, I haven't seen what she said in Brisbane  today. Look I haven't asked her about these 

 comments that she's made. But you know  maybe she's getting irritated by the Australian  media, well it happens to the best of us.

 Journalist: There was a Canadian security  official on ABC television last night saying that  Australia would have received this (inaudible)  security operations on behalf of Beijing here in  Australia, do you have concerns about  (inaudible)?

 Downer: Well look we don't comment on  intelligence matters, obviously we never have  done. And the only thing I would say is that we  have our own intelligence agencies in Australia  which do a good job in terms of counter-espionage and they've been a doing a good job  for the last, I don't know 50 or 60 years and I  have full confidence in the work that they do.  And I think Australia (inaudible) has very good  intelligence agencies and I think they work  very successfully. I'm very proud of the work  that they do.

 Journalist: How do you take these comments  from the Ambassador (inaudible) Chen Yonglin  refugee status to stay in Australia might open  the flood gates for other defectors (inaudible) 

 that sound like a threat in those terms?

 Downer: Well I don't know really, I don't that I  would, look I've just heard what you said I  would have to look at the total context. I  wouldn't really choose to comment on that. I  mean we get about 1000 applicants for  protection visas from people from China every  year, we get an awful a lot of them. I mean  Chen Yonglin is in the media, most of them, I  think the media by the way was surprised we  get 1000 a year that is quite a lot. So we will  just, we the Immigration Department will just  assess the Chen Yonglin application in the  normal way, that's how it should work. I don't  think it should be considered in any abnormal  way, just in the normal way. The claim is  considered, the department looks at our  international obligations and domestic law and  makes a decision on that basis.

 Journalist: Just finally pardon my ignorance  here, but given your experience as a diplomat  and as Foreign Affairs Minister, are these kinds  of comments normal (inaudible) for a  diplomat?

 Downer: Foreign diplomat usually stick up for 

 their countries and particularly... 

 Journalist: (inaudible).

 Downer: In my nine and a half years as Foreign  Minister I've known many an ambassador to  stick up vigorously for their country. And our  diplomats can be very robust as well on  occasion. I don't, look I haven't seen what she'  said today, I saw what she said yesterday and I  just let that fly through to the keeper.
