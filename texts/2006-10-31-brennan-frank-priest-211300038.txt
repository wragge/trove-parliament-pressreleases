 The Launch   of 

 Acting on Conscience  University of Queensland Press   

 Frank Brennan’s Response to Kevin Rudd   

 

 Parliament House, Canberra  31 October 2006 

 

 

 Manning  Clark  once  described  Australia  as  “a  society  unique  in  the  history  of   mankind, a society of men holding no firm beliefs on the existence of God or survival  after  death”.   He  would  have  been  surprised  by  the  weekend  announcement  of   government  approved  chaplains  for  Australian  schools.   In  the  public  forum,  our   leaders do not often speak religious thoughts or admit to religious impulses.  Thus my  own surprise when I attended the mass celebrated by Bishop Carlos Belo in the Dili  Cathedral in 2001 giving thanks for Australia's contribution to the liberation of East  Timor.   At  the  end  of  the  mass,  Major  General  Peter  Cosgrove  spoke.   This  big   Australian army officer in military dress was accompanied by a translator who was a  petite Timorese religious sister in her pure white habit replete with veil. He recalled  his  first  visit  to  the  cathedral  three  months  earlier  when  he  was  so  moved  by  the   singing that he realised two things: first, the people of East Timor had not abandoned  their God despite everything that had happened; second, God had not abandoned the  people  of  East  Timor.   As  he  spoke,  I  was  certain  that  despite  the  presence  of  the   usual media scrum, not one word of this speech would be reported back in Australia.   It was unimaginable that an Australian solider would give such a speech in Australia.   If  he  were  a  US  general,  we  would  expect  it.   Here  in  Australia,  the  public  silence   about things religious does not mean that religion does not animate and inspire many  of us.  It just has a less acknowledged place in the public forum.  It marks its presence  by the reverence of the silence.  That is why we Australians need to be attentive to the  responsible  mix  of  law,  religion  and  politics.   Each  has  its  place  and  each  must  be   kept in place for good of us all, and for the good of our Commonwealth.     

 Those  who  have  recently  held  the  highest  political  office  in  the  land  have  had   occasion to tell religious people, and not just Sheikh Taj el-Din Al Hilaly, to butt out.   At  the  height  of  the  1998  Wik  debate,  Paul  Keating  said,  “Talk  about  Meddling   priests!   When  Aborigines  see  Brennan,  Harradine  and  other  professional  Catholics   coming they should tell them to clear out.”  John Howard when questioned about his  Workchoices  legislation,  in  light  of  the  interventions  by  the  likes  of  Cardinal  Pell,   Archbishop  Jensen,  Archbishop  Aspinall  and  Bishop  Manning,  said:  “If  we  are  to   have a sensible debate on the merits of this legislation, my advice to every person on  this  side  of  the  House  is:  let’s  leave  out  of  the  debate  indications  by  the  clergy  to   either side of the argument.”   

 Just last week we had Senator Kay Patterson replying to a bishop:  “Dear me, I might  be excommunicated!  Anyway, I do not think I will be, because it is my choice, not  the  church’s  choice,  I  suppose.”   We  Australians  are  used  to  politicians,  public   intellectuals and media figures who have little time for religion in their own lives or in

 the public forum.  Mark Latham put such views on public display when he published  his diaries detailing his “first law of the church”: “the greater the degree of fanaticism  in  so-called  faith,  the  greater  the  degree  of  escapism either  from addiction  (alcohol,   drugs, gambling or sex) or from personal tragedy…..Organised religion: just another  form of conservative command and control in our society.”   

 This book is a plea for a rightly circumscribed place at the table for religion in public  deliberation about law and policy.  I hope I have set out rules for engagement which  apply  equally  to  me,  Sheikh  Hillaly  and  Archbishop  Aspinall,  the  Anglican  Primate   who will do a Queensland launch later in the week.  I am delighted that Kevin Rudd  has  agreed  to  do  the  national  launch  here  in  Parliament  House.   Kevin’s  recent   Bonhoeffer  lecture  established  his  credentials  as  a  politician  who  takes  religion   seriously in the political process.  One newspaper asserted that Kevin went “a step too 

 far when he effectively invite(d) the churches to sign on to the Labor cause.”  He did  no  such  thing.   He  rightly  said,  “For  too  long  in  this  country,  there's  been  an   assumption  that  if  you  have  private  faith  your  natural  destination  is  one  of  the   conservative  parties.”   He  invited  individual  Christians  to  respond  to  the  political   challenges  of  the  day  in  light  of  their  faith.   He  also  endorsed  the  role  of  church   leaders who have spoken out on issues such as the new IR laws.  Why shouldn’t they?   Church leaders do have a contribution to make to political debate when they confine  themselves  to  statements  of  principle  consistent  with  their  religious  teachings  and   when they scrutinise laws and policies in light of those principles.  That’s why I am  honoured to have my long time friend Kevin launch Acting on Conscience.   

 Some  citizens  have  religious  beliefs  which  sustain,  inform  and  drive  their  social   commitments  and  comprehensive  view  of  the  ultimate  significance  of  human   existence.  Those views are entitled to a place at the table of deliberative democracy,  just as are the views of the secular humanist.  The secular humanist cannot say, “You  believe life is a transcendent mystery.  I don’t.  Therefore we should for the purposes  of  good  civic  life  simply  assume  that  there  is  no  transcendent  mystery  to  life,  and   anything you think, feel or desire should be translated into a message comprehensible  to me.”   

 The  utilitarianism  of  pragmatic  Australia  has  always  required  an  ethical  corrective   which has often been informed by religious sentiment, whether the issue of the day be  the dispossession of Aborigines, refugee children in detention, our commitment to the  Iraq War for unjustified, wrong reasons, or the wanton corruption of AWB and HIH -  the corporate culmination of the “whatever it takes” mindset.  Religious citizens have  a role in calling a halt to the pragmatism and insisting that some things are wrong in  themselves regardless of the practical consequences for others in the short term.  I am  not suggesting that it is only religious citizens who call for such a halt, nor that it is  only  non-religious  citizens  or  state  officials  who  commit  the  abuses  in  the  name  of   national interest or profit.   

 The state needs to respect the inherent dignity of every person and this requires due  acknowledgement  of  the  person  who  acts  with  a  formed  and  informed  conscience   about what is right for him and for others.  The state is entitled to constrain a person  who  acts  in  a  manner  contrary  to  the  fundamental  human  rights  of  other  citizens  or   contrary to the public interest, given that the public interest includes optimal freedom

 for all persons.  The person who occupies an office of trust in any of the three arms of  government is required to discharge that trust consistent with the terms of the office.   

 Religious leaders are free to proclaim the formal teaching of their faith communities,  not only to their members but to all members of society.  As citizens, they are entitled  to agitate for laws or policies consistent with their formal teaching.  It is not only folly  but it is wrong for religious leaders to represent to the world that all members of their  faith  communities  think  and  act  in  a  way  fully  consistent  with  the  formal  church   teaching,  or  that  most  of  their  members  think  law  and  policy  should  reflect  their   formal church teaching.   

 When people like me agitate for native title or refugees, politicians tend to treat us as  if we are trendy lefties, spared the need to be elected.  But when I, hoping to apply a  consistent  ethic  for  the  protection  of  the  vulnerable,  raise  ethical  quandaries  about   legislation on things like embryonic stem cell research, I am labelled a conservative  Catholic.     

 Imams should have the same liberty as the rest of us to ventilate their views.  But they  should also be guided by the same rules of political morality which is more than the  expedient assessment of what works in the marketplace of ideas.  Public figures who  represent a religious tradition have a social obligation to respect the sensibilities of the  community,  while  cogently  stating  policy  options  consistent  with  their  religious   tradition.  There is nothing prophetic or religious in claims that demean the weak or 

 the vulnerable.  Without media oxygen, such claims can rightly wither.   

 This book is dedicated to five of my nieces who asked that it be readable by them.  I  hope  it  helps  our  Generation  Y  citizens  of  all  faiths  and  none  to  decide  how   responsibly  to  mix  law,  religion  and  politics  in  the  future  public  debates  which  will   shape  our  national  response  to  big  moral  questions.   I  am  sorry  to  note  the  need  to   publish  a  second  edition  of  Tampering  with  Asylum  but  am  delighted  that  the   unprincipled  and  unworkable  Migration  Amendment  (Designated  Unauthorised   Arrivals) Bill 2006 failed to pass because a handful of government members said they  would act on conscience.   

 I  thank  Madonna  Duffy,  Anna  Crago,  Rob  Cullinan,  Taressa  Brennan  and  Belinda   Jennings at University of Queensland Press.  I am delighted they pursued me after my  return  from  Boston  assuring  me  that  the  revamped  UQP  was  still  interested  in  my   public  musings.   I  thank  my  brother  Jesuits  in  Boston,  Sydney  and  Canberra  and   acknowledge  the  presence  of  John  Eddy,  Edward  Dooley  and  Brian  McCoy.   I   especially acknowledge my parents Gerard and Patricia here today.  Mum is the ever  faithful  proof-reader  and  Dad  in  his  retirement  is  now  able  to  attend  such  family   celebrations even if they be held in Parliament House close to the building where he  once  laboured  tirelessly  for  the  good  of  our  commonwealth.   As  they  prepare  to  be   great  grandparents,  neither  of  them  is  to  have  attributed  to  them  the  views  of  their   progeny.   

 Thanks  to  our  MC  Jack  Waterford  who,  with  deprecating  humour,  has  translated   Canberra to many of us over the years.  Thanks to you all for coming.
