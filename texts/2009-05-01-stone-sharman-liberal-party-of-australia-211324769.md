 Fri, 1st May 2009   ENFORCED SECRECY COULD MEAN MORE LOST AT SEA 

 The Hon Dr Sharman Stone MP   Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 Today the Northern Territory Coroner Greg Cavanagh said he is ‘not uncomfortable’  about the releasing of information on the causes of the tragic boat explosion, yet the  Rudd Government have still not shared this information with the Australian Public.  

 Dr Sharman Stone, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship said the fact  that the Coroner himself has indicated that information could be released, does  nothing but heighten concerns that the government is keeping information from the  public to protect their own failed policies.  

 Dr Stone said there has been varying rumours about the how the fatal tragedy on  Ashmore Reef occurred.  

 “Were the asylum seekers not informed about where their boat was being taken to?  Was the explosion a refuelling accident or was it a deliberate act or threat gone  terribly wrong? Are there a set of interception protocols they Navy is supposed to  follow? The answers to these questions will help inform our border protection  agencies and could save future lives.”  

 “Since the Rudd Labor Government’s soft policies are giving comfort to the 7 to 9  thousand reportedly now queued in Indonesia we have to expect more potential  accidents, the fact need airing urgently so new interception protocols for the navy  and customs can be developed.”  

 “It’s about time Prime Minister Rudd lifted his veil of secrecy so all of the facts can be  transparently conveyed to the public.”  

 “The Coalition has been calling for an urgent and independent inquiry into the  impacts of the softened policies, reduced expenditure, staff cuts and bungling of the  new border protection agency ,”  

 “The Rudd Government must learn from consequences of their failed Border  Protection Policy. If Minister Debus is not up to the task in the interest of national  border protection, he must be replaced.”
