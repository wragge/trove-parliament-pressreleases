 Laurie Ferguson MP  Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services 

 

 Mount Gambier embraces Burmese seeking new life 

 Tuesday 9 December 2008 

 Resettlement of Burmese refugees in Mount Gambier is a wonderful example of how  local communities and government can work together to support successful  settlement, the Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement  Services, Laurie Ferguson, said today. 

 In Mount Gambier today to meet the Burmese community, Mr Ferguson said the 50  people, about 10 families, were mainly minority Karen people who had been driven  out of Burma into refugee camps in Thailand by ethnic troubles under successive  military regimes. 

 The Australian Government launched a pilot project in 2007 to settle refugees in  Mount Gambier and the project has been so successful the people were quickly  regarded as part of the local community. 

 The pilot was conducted with the support of the community, local service providers  and other government departments. A recent independent review judged the pilot a  resounding success and recommended further refugee settlement in Mount Gambier  based on this. 

 ‘The Department of Immigration and Citizenship is discussing further settlement with  the South Australian government and working to identify more suitable refugee  families who could be settled in Mount Gambier,’ Mr Ferguson said. 

 While in Mount Gambier today, Mr Ferguson also launched a project under the  Sustainable Regional Settlement program to identify suitable employment  opportunities and training for newly arrived humanitarian entrants in the Limestone  Coast area.  

 In addition, the parliamentary secretary opened the new premises for the Limestone  Coast Migrant Resource Centre and launched the Murray Lands, Limestone Coast  and Riverland Resource Directory. 

 ‘This directory contains a wealth of information on support services for people newly  arrived to Australia,’ Mr Ferguson said. 

 The resource directory and settlement program have been funded by the  Government through DIAC with funds totaling more than $74 000.
