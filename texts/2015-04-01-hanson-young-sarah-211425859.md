 MEDIA RELEASE

 Government must show compassion toward dying asylum seeker   

 The Australian Greens are today calling on the government to show some compassion toward a 25 year  old Iranian asylum seeker who is close to death after 38 days of hunger striking.    

 “It is truly tragic that a young man has been driven to such despair that he is willing to forgo his life  rather than return to his homeland”, Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Hanson-Young said.    

 “What kind of country have we become when people would rather starve themselves to death than  remain in detention or be deported?    

 “One has to ask why this young man was driven to such lengths, he clearly believes that he has no other  option and that is extremely sad.    

 “This man’s life is hanging in the balance and I am calling on Minister Dutton to forget the politics for  once and act immediately.    

 “The government cannot sit idly by and watch this man die, we must determine what has driven him  and many others to attempt suicide.”
