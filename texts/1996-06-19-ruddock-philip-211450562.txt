 GOVERNMENT ACTS TO MAINTAIN BOAT PROCESSING INTEGRITY

 The Government has been forced to take action to prevent unauthorised arrivals from  being encouraged to engage unwarranted, lengthy and expensive processing, the  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock announced today.

 "A recent decision in the Federal Court has shown up an inconsistency in  Commonwealth legislative provisions which threatens the integrity of entry procedures.  The Government will address this issue by introducing legislation to take effect from  today," Mr Ruddock said.

 The Migration Act requires that where people in detention request a lawyer, they be  given the oppotunity to do so.

 The effect of the recent Federal Court decision is that the Human Rights and Equal  Opportunity (HREOC) Act can be used to undermine the intent of the Migration Act,  allowing lawyers to provide unsolicited advice to people who have entered Australia  illegally.

 'This could give unauthorised arrivals unrealistic expectations that they will be able to  remain in Australia. Also, by undermining the integrity of entry procedures, it could  encourage more boat arrivals."

 "The legislation the Government will introduce, addresses the inconsistency and will  assist in maintaining the integrity of the entry system."
