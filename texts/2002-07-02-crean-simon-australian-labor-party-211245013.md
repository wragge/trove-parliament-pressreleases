 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION   

 TRANSCRIPT 0F DOORSTOP - MELBOURNE, WEDNESDAY 2 JULY 2003   

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY   

 

 Subjects:  Shadow  Ministry  Reshuffle  

 

 

 CREAN: I have taken the opportunity today to announce a major reshuffle  of my front bench.  It is the half-way mark of the term but, more importantly, Labor  has clearly mapped out the agenda on which it wants to fight to win the next  election and to redress the damage that the Howard Government has done to  Australian families; to its neglect so far as the environment is concerned; and the  neglect so far as building the nation is concerned.   

 I have said that I want to see policies that encourage a strong, sustainable economy  but a fair society.  And what I want, having identified the key areas on which we  want to present boldness in policy, difference in policy, and what is fundamentally  Labor policy, I want to rearrange the front bench to reflect the best people to carry  those tasks forward.   

 I have asked Mark Latham to take on the role of Shadow Treasurer, but I have  asked Bob McMullan at the same time to not only take the Finance position, but a  new position - Shadow Minister for Cabinet - to coordinate the costings and the  priorities.  This is one of Bob’s great strengths.  It’s one that I want to tap into.   

 In both these people I believe I have got the right mix in terms of the core of the  economic portfolios - people who will identify the priorities, people who will fight for  Australian families.  And I believe it is the appropriate mix to take forward.   

 Jenny Macklin, of course, remains in Employment, Education and Training.  I had  long discussions with Jenny about that, because she has done in previous jobs a  fantastic role in health.  It was a position that had to be filled, together with the  ongoing work, which we are still to announce in terms of education.     

 Jenny will stay with Employment, Education and Training, and I welcome that.  I  think she would have been terrific in either role, but she will be at the forefront of 

  1

 our new initiatives for education, because what the Howard Government is doing is  unfair.  It’s pricing young people out of education.  We have got to redress that, and  we need the policies to do it.   

 I have also asked Julia Gillard to take on the responsibilities in Health.  Julia has  been an excellent performer in her previous role, and that does leave a big gap, but  there is still much more work to be done in health.  I have announced a down  payment in terms of health, but there is more work to be done and I want the  continuous campaigning, together with the further policy development, to also be at  the forefront of our thinking.   

 I have asked Nicola Roxon to take on the responsibilities for Population and  Immigration.  Nicola, as you would be aware, has done an excellent job in terms of  early-childhood policies, early-childhood learning, protection of our children, and is  an important contributor in the work and family debate.   

 Jacinta Collins, the new entrant to the Shadow Ministry, takes over the responsibility  for Children and Youth.     

 Stephen Conroy takes on the critical responsibilities - apart from those areas that he  has been pursuing: corporate governance; financial services; small business - he  takes over the crucial Trade portfolio in the circumstances where issues surrounding  that are going to be key to the future direction of this country.   

 Craig Emerson becomes the Shadow Minister for Workplace Relations.  This is an  area that isn’t just about the industrial relations that Tony Abbott would like to talk  about - the confrontation - but how we get the balance between work and family,  how we bring fairness back into the workplace, and how we look again at the job  opportunities for the future.  These are opportunities that are going missing under  this Government.   

 The others are listed; I could go through them all.  Can I just make the point,  though, that this is a major reshuffle.  It reflects the priorities and it reflects the  reordering of the talent that I have on the front bench, put - in my judgement - to  its best use and its best cooperative approach.  I want an agenda that advances the  interests of Australian families.  I want an agenda that advances the cause of the  environment.  I want an agenda that builds a strong, sustainable economy with a  fair society.  The front bench that I have announced today will give us our best shot  of promoting that agenda.  And the winners out of this will be the Australian people.   

 JOURNALIST: Would you have preferred Jenny Macklin to switch to health?   

 CREAN: Jenny would be terrific in whatever role she chose.  She has done  a fantastic job in the past in Health, and she has done a great job in terms of the  Employment, Education and Training portfolios.  This is a huge area that we have to  develop.

 Of course, these involved lengthy discussions.  I didn’t have a preoccupation with  this.  What I really wanted was the best people in the key roles, and I am delighted  with the outcome.   

 JOURNALIST: Did you choose Mark Latham more on his performance as a head-kicker than his economic policies?   

 CREAN: No.  In fact, Mark Latham, I think brings great strength and  balance and commitment to the range of economic portfolios that we have to get  the right balance in.  I think it is really a question of seeing the combination of Mark  Latham and Bob McMullan together, and that is the prism through which one has to  see this decision.  I am trying to draw on the strengths of all of my front bench  people.  I want them to be out there, aggressive in the interests of Australian people  and their interests, and how we advance the nation.   

 I have had the opportunity to see people perform over the course of the past  18 months but, more importantly, I have identified the priorities for the Labor Party  to take forward.  That is the mandate on which I was re-elected in terms of the  leadership.  What I am doing today is giving us our best shot at the most effective  promotion of that agenda.   

 JOURNALIST: Mark Latham has the capacity to use inflammatory language.   

 CREAN: He’s not the only one who has that. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Have you given him any advice about toning down that tendency?   

 CREAN: Mark and I talk a lot.  I give him advice, and he gives me advice.   That is the way the interchange should be.  But I think that you would all have to  agree that Mark Latham has been a significant contributor and has grown in the jobs  and the functions that he has been allocated.  Now, in the end, what you have got  to do is to continue to nurture and to reward, but to also get the right mix in terms  of the Shadow Ministry.  That, I believe, I have got.   

 The other decision that I think is interesting to note is that there will no longer be a  Shadow Cabinet.  All members, by definition, are in the Shadow Ministry, but there  will be no Shadow Cabinet.  We will meet as a full Shadow Ministry in future.   

 JOURNALIST: You didn’t mention Indigenous Affairs.  Does that stay with  Population?   

 CREAN: No.  Indigenous Affairs and Reconciliation also goes to Bob  McMullan.  I have said before that I see this as a key issue which this nation has to  come to grips with.  There are all sorts of issues that remain unresolved, but for us  as a nation to advance, to build, to strengthen, we do have to have reconciliation.  I  indicated when I became Leader that this was an important value.  It was a task  that I gave Cabinet ranking to in the old structure.  It will be given seniority here.  I  am committed to us progressing the agenda in this area.

 JOURNALIST: You mentioned reconciliation.  I see Wayne Swan is still there.   Have you had a clean out of Beazley supporters in the reshuffle?   

 CREAN: No, no, no.  In fact, I am delighted that Wayne has chosen to  remain in the portfolio that he has been so good at - demonstrating the  Government’s failings - which he has had responsibility for over a number of years  now, and we need to keep his policy development talents.  I did talk with him about  whether he wanted a change; he didn’t.  I’m delighted that he wants to stay in the  same area, because the families are going to be a crucial part of our agenda.   

 JOURNALIST: Julia Gillard has been a very good opponent to Ruddock.  Are you  confident that Nicola Roxon can continue that, seeing that we’ve got another  refugee situation on our hands again?   

 CREAN: Yes, well I am absolutely confident.  This was a difficult position  to fill.  I am absolutely convinced in Nicola’s ability to carry out those functions.    

 I might say that Julia wasn’t here today.  She is in Canberra.  Obviously the question  of the Senate inquiry is a matter that needs to be drawn together.  Her work needs  to be finalised, but I’m convinced that Nicola will be able to perform these duties.   

 The other important thing, of course, is that it is not just the issue of immigration  policy, which we have developed - and obviously we have got a Government whose  policies at the moment do need changing and they are recognising that gradually -  but there is the crucial area of population policy, which is where I want someone  with flair and creativity to also carry on that policy development task.   

 JOURNALIST: On another matter, Mr Crean, the incident with John Sutton today  - what is your reaction to that?  Do you see it as a return to the bad old days of the  BLF?   

 CREAN: Well, I haven’t seen the video.  I only saw the newspaper report  this morning, and I have been here in meetings all day today.  However, violence in  the workplace, on worksites, can’t be condoned.  This is not the Australian way, and  it can’t be justified under any circumstances.   

 The dispute itself is one which should never have happened, quite frankly.  It was a  dispute that, if the Government hadn’t legislated to take away the good-faith  bargaining in the workplace, we would have seen the ability of the Commission to  get involved to resolve it.  I have introduced a Private Member’s Bill to restore that  requirement for good-faith bargaining and to get the independent umpire back in.     

 But violence on the worksite can’t be condoned.  Violence in industrial disputes can’t  be condoned.  My understanding is that John Sutton, himself, has issued an  unreserved apology in relation to the incident, but I have not seen the incident.  I  have not had the opportunity to speak to Mr Sutton, but I don’t condone violence in  any circumstances, quite frankly.

 JOURNALIST: Do you think the police should investigate Mr Sutton’s role in this?   

 CREAN: That is up to them.  They were there, as I understand it from the  newspaper report today.  They were on the site at the time.  It is a matter for the  New South Wales Police, but without having seen the incident - and I know how  Tony Abbott would try to blow this up - I think that I would prefer to see the full  details of what happened before I comment any further.   

 JOURNALIST: Did you offer Kevin Rudd an alternative to Foreign Affairs?   

 CREAN: I did speak to Kevin.  I didn’t offer him anything, as such, I think  he has done an excellent job in that role.  I indicated to him that I wanted him to  continue in the role.  I didn’t have any qualms about that.  But if he wanted to  consider an alternative, I was prepared, myself, to consider that.  He came back to 

 me and indicated that he wanted to stay with the present job, and I welcome that.   He has been an excellent Shadow Foreign Minister, and he will continue in that role.   

 JOURNALIST: Is Bob McMullan disappointed to lose Treasury?   

 CREAN: Well, I had to make some hard decisions, Michael.  Reshuffles are  always difficult but, as I say, Australian families are hurting, and the nation is  suffering.  We are becoming a place that we won’t recognise as Australia.  The  notion of a fair go is disappearing, and the Government is shifting the cost from 

 Government to individuals.  These are key issues and points of difference.     

 I want to concentrate on an agenda that improves the lives of Australian families.  I  want to pursue an agenda that improves our environment.  I want to be on an  agenda for nation-building.  But the issues of national security, of values, and of  economic management remain crucial in terms of any of our considerations.  What I  have got is the very best mix possible.  I have a front bench of enormous talent.  I  am putting them to better use and I will match that other side, person for person,  any day.   

 JOURNALIST: You are going down to Adelaide.  Are you going to have a chat to  Tom Koutsantonis over there about the article that he wrote?   

 CREAN: Well, I’m not aware of the article that he has written.  But I am  going to Adelaide and I am going to be campaigning on Medicare.  And I’ll be going  back again, because the issue of saving the Murray River is vital.  I’ll have lots of  good things to say in Adelaide.
