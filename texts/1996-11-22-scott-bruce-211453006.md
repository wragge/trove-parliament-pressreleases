 Your Eminence, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.

 I feel honoured to be asked on behalf of the Government to  open this Conference, both because of the importance of the  work being done here this weekend and in light of your  success in drawing together such a broad and authoritative  group of speakers and participants.

 With such an enormous and critically important topic before  us - nothing less that how Australia should address poverty  and injustice - it is important that in setting our goals we also  look to the ‘how’, the ‘when’ and the ‘what’ of the things we  would like to achieve. The successful evolution of ideas to  implementation is a challenge which each of us in Government 

 and the Ministry faces every day. Ultimately, it is the  standard by which we will be judged.

 I was reassured to read the Bishops’ Pastoral Statement “A  New Beginning: Eradicating Poverty in Our World” and later  the draft “Plan of Action to eradicate Poverty” and find such  a solid focus on practical action and direct responsibility.

 In reading both these documents I found that we have much in  common. This is in part because this Government considers  itself an active part of the community. We listen to the wider  community and we work with it, towards common goals.

 In this context, I would like to explain to your our part in the  struggle to alleviate and prevent poverty at home and abroad.

 The Australian Aid Program

 In doing so I would like to begin with Australia’s Overseas Aid  Program before going on to discuss in some detail how, as a  Government, we are addressing poverty within Australia.

 The United Nations Declaration of 1996 as the International  Year for the Eradication of Poverty focused on the importance  of the world community addressing the severest or ’absolute’   levels of poverty. This sentiment, that aid must address need, 

 is one shared by this Government.

 First and foremost, we have made it clear that the focus of  Australia’s aid program has to be poverty reduction.

 In 1996-7 the Government has committed $1.45 billion to  official development assistance. That funding covers a wide  variety of activities, but is predominantly focussed on East  Asia and the Pacific. Australia also provides significant 

 assistance to a number of countries in South Asia and Africa.  This geographical coverage means that Australia’s aid  program covers those areas containing the greater part of the  world’s most needy people.

 The aid program tries to match Australia’s expertise to the  priorities of each recipient country. These include education,  health, water supply and sanitation, transport and  communications and agriculture. In addition, Australia  intends to provide some $81 million in 1996 -97 to meet  emergency, refugee and relief needs.

 The end result is a program which covers a wide spectrum of  poverty challenges, including immediate response to

 Page 3

 humanitarian emergencies, support for basic needs and  assistance in generating longer-term sustainable development.

 The Simons' Review of the Australian Overseas Aid Program,  currently underway, is a vital element in the Government's  strategy to examine how aid can best be used to reduce  poverty.

 The Government expects the Review's findings to be handed  down early next year.

 The Alleviation of Domestic Poverty

 I now turn to the situation within Australia and the  Commonwealth's role in poverty prevention and alleviation.

 The generations who have gone before us endured two World  Wars and a scarring depression to give us the freedom and the  quality of life we know enjoy. As Minister for Veterans'  Affairs it is my responsibility and my privilege to work for 

 those who fought for this country. Our veterans sacrificed  much for us - their health, and in far too many cases, their  lives. We are forever indebted to these people. In return for  their sacrifice, we must ensure we pass to the next and future  generations, a better standard of living and new opportunities.

 With this in mind I will start by setting out what we consider  are the four major challenges faced by Government in shaping  better outcomes for the Australian community:

 Firstly, high and persistent unemployment - where  employment growth is too low to provide jobs for everyone  who wants or needs one and where the lack of demand for

 Page 4

 the low skilled, the young, and increasingly, for older males,  has effectively excluded them from the workforce;

 Secondly, changes to the structure of families - with  increasing numbers of lone parent households, more women  in the paid workforce, higher rates of family breakdown and  growing income disparities between families;

 Thirdly, an increasingly ageing society - brought about by a  range of factors including greater longevity;

 Fourthly, the question of how we are to meet the financial  consequences of these changes while responding to demands  for reduced taxation and lower fiscal deficits.

 These then are our principle challenges. To a greater or lesser  extent, these same challenges face all the countries of the  industrialised world at a time of rapid economic, social and  technological change. The question is how do we respond to  them to achieve a fair and just society?

 Our Values and Commitments

 I said earlier, having read the Pastoral Statement and the  Conference documents, that I believe we have many values in  common. This commonality is reflected in the following five  commitments we have made and reiterated to the Australian  community:

 Our first commitment is to the family continuing to be the  foundation of our society and its most important stabilising  influence;

 Page 5

 Our second commitment is to sustaining and maintaining the  safety net so that we can all live in a fair and compassionate  society in which individuals have the opportunity to succeed  and prosper through their own initiative;

 The third is our commitment to the highest levels of  employment possible;

 The fourth is to ensuring all Australians have the  opportunity to have an adequate income, affordable  housing, quality health care and a level of education which  allows them to achieve their full potential; and

 The fifth is to develop incentives within our social welfare  system which encourage independence and self help.

 In short, we seek a society where people are able to control  their lives and play a fulfilling role not only in the workforce  but - more broadly - in the community. We will support those  who need it but avoid creating dependence in favour of 

 empowering people to achieve economic independence. We  will not walk away from those whose problems are complex  and sensitive.

 There are two examples of the Government’s readiness to  support those in need, of which I am particularly proud. I  refer firstly to our proposal to offer the services of the army to  remote Aboriginal communities in need of improved water  and sewerage systems. Secondly, I refer to our decision to  provide farming families with a longer period of time to  recover from the ravages of exceptional drought, before  financial support provisions are withdrawn.

 These two examples are by no means the Government’s only  commitments specific to the poverty experienced by  Aboriginal people or rural communities. But to me, they  highlight the practicality and the creativity of our approach.

 Response to the Challenge

 But I digress. The Government has taken a three pronged  approach to the alleviaton of poverty. We have to address the  causes of our difficulties, deal with their consequences and  ensure we fully understand the problems and the viability of  the solutions being considered.

 Economic Management

 With this in mind the Coalition Government is working to  create genuine jobs through a well managed economy. To this  end the Government is introducing a number of reforms  aimed at reducing the burden on the largest employer within  the economy and the employer of the most diverse skills - small  business - and to create a more flexible and responsive labour  market.

 To support investment and reduce interest rate pressures we  are encouraging higher levels of national savings, reducing  public debt and improving public sector efficiency. In  addition we are actively pursuing Australia's trade interests 

 through the reduction of barriers to world trade and opening  up new markets for Australian producers.

 Social Safety Net

 At the same time for those groups and individuals in society  facing disadvantage we have not only maintained Australia’s

 Page 7

 social safety net but have introduced a number of reforms to  make it more effective. This safety net not only includes Social  Security benefits but also world standard medical care for all  and a range of community and education services. It is 

 unusual in that it also covers those who are not participating  in the paid workforce due to caring responsibilities, disability  or old age as effectively as it does those in the labour force.

 Our safety net’s effectiveness in poverty alleviation has been  recognised world-wide by experts and studied by international  organisations such as the OECD.

 Age Pensions

 For the first time ever, the Commonwealth Government has  made a commitment to provide funding in the budget  estimates to maintain the rate of age pension at 25 per cent of 

 male average weekly earnings. This clearly indicates the  priority the government places on ensuring the adequacy of  pensions and of course, similarly applies to the service pension  paid to eligible members of the veteran community.

 Family Tax Initiative

 From January next year around 900,000 low income families  will benefit from the introduction of the Family Tax Initiative.  Over forty percent of this billion dollar initiative will go to low  income families. For example, a low income family with three  small children will receive an extra $42.30 per fortnight on top 

 of their current entitlements.

 The Family Tax Initiative will help to ensure families with  children, especially single income families with young  children, receive greater financial assistance in recognition of

 Page 8

 the costs involved in raising children. The initiative also  confirms this government's commitment to giving lone parents  greater financial support to raise their children.

 Lone parents are among those in the community most at risk  of poverty. The Family Tax Initiative will provide them with a  substantial increase in income. For instance, a lone parent  with two children, one of whom is aged under five, will be  $34.64 a fortnight better off from the Family Tax Initiative.

 Housing Assistance

 This government is committed to effective and equitable  housing for people on low incomes. Currently, privately  renting social security customers receive an average rent  assistance subsidy of around $1,500 a year, while public  tenants receive on average $4,000. At the same time public  housing waiting lists are growing - there are now 235,000  applicants nationally.

 This situation is clearly unfair. The Government is aiming, in  partnership with the States and Territories, to reform housing  assistance arrangements. Under the proposed reforms, the  Commonwealth will take responsibility for subsidies for public  and private renters. The states will continue to supply and  manage public housing, integrating this with their related  welfare, disability and health services.

 The changes will lead to a fairer system for everyone.

 Incentives, costs and simplification

 By providing income security on the basis of need, Australia  has a more flexible and affordable system than countries

 Page 9

 which have in the past relied on social insurance models.  Means testing, however, comes with two inherent problems -  increased complexity and the creation of employment and  poverty traps - both factors with cost penalties and which act  against the interests of recipients and help create dependency.

 Australia’s response to this has been to modify the high  effective marginal tax rates on benefits by introducing tapers  and 'free areas'. In so doing, incentives to work are preserved.  At the same time we have acted to tighten the administration 

 of unemployment benefits to achieve better compliance and  maintain community support for the system.

 It is important that Australians understand and are able to  access their social security entitlements. Over time the social  security system has become so complex that even departmental  staff are often unable to give people the assistance they need.  The government is committed to simplifying social security so  that it is easier to understand, easier to administer, and is  more focussed on the actual needs of customers.

 The importance of community support and community  solutions to increasing levels of poverty cannot be over­ emphasised. In recognition of the invaluable role played by  the community and welfare sector, the Government has  committed an additional $5 million a year in emergency relief  funding for non-government organisations, taking the total  funding to well in excess of $20 million a year.

 This Government has also taken the initiative of encouraging  active participation in the community and welfare sector. The  long term unemployed and older unemployed are now able to  volunteer their time to community organisations, without

 Page 10

 seeking paid work and without losing their social security  entitlements.

 Youth Homelessness

 In the area of youth homelessness, the Government has  allocated $8.1 million to fund the youth homelessness pilot  programme.

 The main elements of the pilot include: â¢ an increased emphasis on family reconciliation; â¢ greater focus on young people when they become homeless  or are at risk of homelessness; â¢ involving the community welfare sector more; and â¢ better coordination between and within government and 

 community sectors.

 Conclusion

 I have outlined tonight, how we, as a Government, are  attacking poverty and disadvantage abroad and at home. We  do not have all the answers. Within Australia, where we find  barriers to employment, we look for ways of reducing them.  Where social and economic change causes hardship, we act to 

 alleviate it. Where people are excluded from participation in  society, we seek to give them back the means and confidence to  rejoin it. When concerned Australians identify issues and  possible solutions, we listen.

 At this time, I would like to read to you a message conveyed by  the Governor-General:

 Compared with most other countries, Australia is a prosperous  nation. Yet, even in Australia, poverty is an overwhelming

 Page 11

 national problem. Usually the cause lies in some other form of   blameless disadvantage. Even in those cases where poverty can  be attributed to a person’s own conduct, there will almost always  be other completely innocent victims, commonly children, who  suffer.

 In the long term, the issues of poverty both in Australia and  overseas will only be effectively addressed pursuant to some  coherent and comprehensive plan to identify and seek to remedy  the underlying causes. The magnitude of the task involved in  formulating and implementing such a plan is daunting. It does 

 not, however, absolve us o f the obligation in conscience to  attempt it

 The objective o f the People First Conference is to develop a  national plan through which the Catholic Church will address  the issues o f poverty both in Australi and overseas in the years  leading up to the new Millennium. It will seek to identify  poverty issues for action and to formulate the strategies most 

 likely to be successful in addressing them. The development and  implementation o f such a national plan are essential and noble  tasks o f Christian outreach in the service both o f this country  and o f the world. That is particularly the case in this  international year for the eradication ofpoverty.

 All those attending the Conference have Helen’s and my  warmest admiration, encouragement and support.

 So, finally, I would like to join with the Governor-General in  wishing all participants a most productive and fruitful  conference. I now formally declare the People First  Conference open.

 Thank you.
