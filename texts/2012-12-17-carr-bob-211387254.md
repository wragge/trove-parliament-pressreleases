 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  Senator the Hon. Bob Carr 

 December 17 

 

 Australia's Aid Budget  

 

 Australia’s aid expenditure for the financial year 2012/13 will be a record $5.2 billion -  $300 million more than the previous year, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bob Carr said  today.    

 Senator Carr said this contradicts some reports the aid budget has been cut.    

 Senator Carr said that even for a big aid budget like Australia’s there are always  competing priorities that must be considered.    

 Supporting refugees and potential refugees around the world is a regular part of  Australia’s aid effort.    

 It is what we do when we provide assistance for refugees in Jordan, Lebanon and  Sudan when people flee from violence or natural disasters.    

 And it is what we do when refugees are in our region or in our country.    

 This year we will report up to $375 million for basic subsistence for refugees waiting  to have their claims heard in Australia.    

 This will cover food, shelter and other essential items.    

 It is legitimate aid delivered in accordance with OECD guidelines and is consistent  with the practice of other OECD countries including the United States ($895 million in  2010); France ($435 million in 2010); Sweden ($397 million in 2010); Netherlands  ($339 million in 2010); Norway ($335 million in 2010); and Canada ($284 million in  2010).
