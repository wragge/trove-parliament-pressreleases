 MEDIA RELEASE   

 24 October 2012     

 Government must not take any chances on deporting people to danger or death: Greens     

 The Australian Government must ensure the safety of a Tamil man they are sending back to Sri  Lanka at the same time as the British High Court has chosen to halt similar deportations, the  Australian Greens said today.   

 “The British High Court is aware of the persecution that awaits these people when they return  home, but the Australian Government is still deporting them," Greens spokesperson for  immigration, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “NGOs such as Amnesty International report that serious human rights breaches are still occurring in  Sri Lanka, despite the end of the Civil War, and there is mounting evidence that people are being  targeted upon being forcibly returned.    

 “If Australia is to deport people to refugee-producing countries like Sri Lanka then there must be  guarantees of oversight and monitoring of their well-being and safety afterwards.      

 “We know that people who Australia previously returned to Sri Lanka faced harm and further  persecution. When the stakes are so high, the government must not take any chances with people’s  lives.
