 REFU G EE POLICY NEEDS URGENT CLARIFICATION

 As a matter of urgency, the Minister for Immigration Local Government and  Ethnic Affairs needs to clarify the Government's refugee policy.

 Has the Government reserved 14,000 places in the refugee program for  refugees created by the Gulf war?

 The total places allocated in the present global refugee program, including  those granted temporary residence, totals only 11,000.

 Only 300 of these were allocated for refugees from the Middle East.

 In the light of these facts, what is the status of reported comments by Jenny  Hoskin, spokesperson for the Department of Immigration, Local  Government and Ethnic Affairs, that "we are already geared up for  immigration emergencies and have allocated extra places, 12,000 to 14,000  of them, for Middle Eastern people as a result of the Gulf War".

 Surely on a matter as significant as this, a Ministerial Announcement should  have been made if any decision has been taken.
