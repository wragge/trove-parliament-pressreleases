 Media Release 

 Shepparton Welcomes Migrants and Refugees

 21 April 2005

 The Australian Government is continuing to help migrants and refugees successfully settle in the Shepparton community.

 Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Peter McGauran joined Federal Member for Murray, Dr Sharman Stone  today to meet with local agencies, employers and Councilors involved in important settlement services.

 ‘Agencies such as the Ethnic Council of Shepparton and the Uniting Care Cutting Edge Youth Services provide a vital link  between the incoming settlers and their new community with direct assistance in a variety of areas including housing and  employment,’ Minister McGauran said.

 ‘The Multicultural Education Centre also plays an essential role in the settlement process through its English language  training and employment programs.

 ‘From this support, migrants and refugees develop a sense of belonging and are able to become full participants in their  community both socially and economically,’ Minister McGauran said.

 Shepparton, with the support of its Local Council, is part of a new Humanitarian Pilot Program which was developed to  encourage more migrants to settle in regional areas now and into the future. 

 Over the coming months, up to 10 families who have migrated from countries such as Sudan will move to Shepparton and  become part of the local community.

 ‘More than 500 migrants and refugees have permanently settled in Shepparton over the past four years from countries such  as Albania, Iraq, India and Kuwait,’ Minister McGauran said.

 ‘Today’s meetings show that the Australia Government is listening to the concerns of the settlement agencies and the  diverse communities they assist.’

 ‘The Australian Government is always looking for better ways to help new arrivals settle into their new community,’  Minister McGauran said.
