  Push Back Illegal Arrivals  Monday, 15 March 2010 

 Turning boats carrying asylum seekers back to where they came from is the strongest  message Australia can send to people smugglers said Canning MP Don Randall.    

 Proposing the “Italian Solution” in Parliament this week Mr Randall urged the Rudd Labor  Government to heed the example set by Italy in stemming the tide of asylum seeks from  Libya.    

 “In 2008 Italian Prime Minister Berlosconi formalised a ‘push back’ agreement with Libyan  authorities to intercept and return unauthorised boats crossing the Mediterranean,” Mr  Randall said.   “It’s worked. The number of illegal arrivals in Italy has fallen to 10 per cent of what it a matter  of months, dropping from 19,000 illegal arrivals in 2008 to only 1,900 in 2009.”   Mr Randall said that because of the geographic proximity and origin of most arrivals, the  Italian-Libyan situation drew parallels with the Australian-Indonesian relations, although he  had reservations about the Indonesian Government’s willingness to prioritise the asylum  seeker issue.   “As long as the Rudd Government fails to take a stand on illegal arrivals the mentality will  remain: if you can get to Australia, you’ll get a visa,” said Mr Randall.   “Asylum seekers are paying $20,000 to people smugglers to get here and they are willing to  take the risk because they know at the end is the golden orb of a visa to stay in Australia,  health care and Centrelink benefits.”   “The Rudd Government has been essentially been giving away visas, with it becoming clear  this week that three Afghans who colluded to lie about their involvement in the explosion  aboard the SIEV 36 are happily living in Australia.”   Since the Rudd Labor Government dismantled tough border protection measures in August  2008 there have been 92 boats intercepted carrying 4,162 asylum seekers.   The Coalition remains unashamedly tough on protecting Australia’s borders. Following the  introduction of the Pacific Solution in 2002-03 only one boat arrived. In 2004-2005, there  were no boat arrivals.
