 AUSTRALIAN WHEAT IN $4M AID PACKAGE FOR AFGHANISTAN

 Australian wheat will be a key part of a $4 million relief and rehabilitation package for Afghahistan and Afghan refugees, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Gareth Evans, said today.

 "Over a decade of war has destroyed thousands of homes, farms and livelihoods in Afghanistan and left a tragic legacy of landmines," Senator Evans said.

 "Continued fighting between rival groups, especially around Kabul, is now delaying the rehabilitation process and the return of about 1.5 mi llion refugees.

 "Australia will provide significantlevels of assistance to Afghanistan and Afghan refugees through United Nations agencies, the International Commi ttee of the Red Cross and Australian non-government organisations," Senator Ev ans said.

 AIDAB, Austra lia's overseas aid agency, has allocated $2.5 mi llion for the purchase and shipment of about 7,000 tonnes of Australian wheat to suppo rt the UN's World Food Pro gra mm e  operations. A IDAB will allocate $400,000 for United Nations mine clea ring operations. The operation has cleared about 68,000 mines since 1990. Last year Australia provided $700,000 for demining operations.

 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) will receive $300,000 to provide medical assistance to hospitals, clinics and first aid posts. The ICRC is ca rrying out rehabilitation work and is training local doctors and nurses in war surgery techniques. As anti personnel mines cause about 60 per

 cent of admissions, special emphasis is being placed on the treatment of injuries from mines.

 The United Nations Development Programme will receive $220,000 to help repair Kabul's water reticulation system. Earlier in the year Australia provided $50,0 00 to combat a cholera outbreak caused by polluted water.

 AIDAB is also allo^ .ating $500,000 to support Australian non-government organisations with rehabilitation work.

 AUSTCARE will receive $318,000 to assist returnees in Takhar Province in transplanting 400,000 fruit trees to establish orchards on family farms. The project will help restore the role of Afghanistan's orchards as an important source of income and nutrition for Afghan families. A IDAB recently jr.ovided AUSTCARE with $92,00 0 0 for an education and literacy project for Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

 The International Women's Development Agency will use S175,[YJO to support vocational, literacy and health care training through the Afghan Wo men's Resource Comm in Peshawar, Pakistan.

 In November, AIDAB purchased i 00,000 square metres of plastic sheeting from an Adelaide company to replace shell-shattered windows in hospitals, schools and houses in Kabul. Last financial year AIDAB provided £3.8m for relief and rehabilitation work, including S2.7m in food aid, for Afghanistan and Afghan refugees.
