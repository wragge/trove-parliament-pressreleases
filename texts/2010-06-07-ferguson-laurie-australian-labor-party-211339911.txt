 Laurie Ferguson MP 

 Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement  Services   

 $35.8 million to enhance Australian settlement  services  7 June 2010 

 The Australian Government will spend $35.8 million in the next financial year on  services to help refugees and migrants settle into their new communities, the  Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services, Laurie  Ferguson, said today. 

 From 1 July 2010, a total of 226 projects delivered through 224 organisations will be  funded as part of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship’s (DIAC) settlement  grants program (SGP), which aims to help refugees and migrants become self-reliant, contribute to the national economy and acquire crucial skills and knowledge  about life in Australia. 

 ‘There are some exciting projects being funded this program year, which will make a  real difference to the lives of many new Australians,’ Mr Ferguson said. 

 ‘These projects will help people to make the transition into Australian life by building  on their existing skills, and at the same time, helping them to learn valuable new  ones. 

 ‘These will provide practical assistance for people starting new lives in Australia.’ 

 During 2010-11 financial year, the program will provide $35.8 million to organisations  across Australia, with projects funded in every state and territory. 

 ‘I thank and commend settlement grants-funded organisations for their immense  contribution to the positive and successful settlement of people who are new to our  nation,’ Mr Ferguson said. 

 Some of the successful applicant organisations include migrant resource centres,  multicultural service agencies, educational institutions, community groups and  welfare organisations. 

 A complete list of successful applicants in the 2010-11 funding round is available on  the DIAC website  See: Settlement Grants Program
