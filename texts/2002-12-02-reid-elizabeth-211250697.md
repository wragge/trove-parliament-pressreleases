  1Respecting and Embracing Difference:  Thoughts of an transient Insider 

  Paper presented at the Conference:  Thirty Years Later:  The Whitlam Government as Modernist Politics  Old Parliament House Canberra 2 - 3 December 2002 

  By 

  Elizabeth Reid 

  Within a setting of respect for traditional elders, traditional owners and  political ancestors, I wish to add my homage to this building, now known as  Old Parliament House. This was a building which, in its design, its spaces for  interaction, its intimacy and quiet dignity, and its working staff, made good  governance more likely. The building nestles gently into the surrounding 

  hills, echoing/personifying Manning Clark's thesis about the relationship  between Australians and their physical geography. Its dimensions are at  one and the same time welcoming and stately. 

  With the Parliamentary Library centre stage/at its entrance, it placed value  on thoughtful and informed governance. The very building itself facilitated  friendships across party lines, of which, in the times of the Whitlam  Governments, there were quite a few. It facilitated informal as well as  formal interactions between politicians and those gatekeepers of  transparency and accountability, the press. It, and its working staff, made  welcome those citizens who wished to exercise their civil responsibilities and  enter the spaces of governance to have their say. I t warms my heart to be  back in this building. 

  But now I wish to walk past the rose gardens, across to the National Gallery  of Australia. 

  Recently, a young BPWE security officer at the National Gallery of Australia  was talking to me about his work. (BPWE = Born Post Whitlam Era.) 

  If you had to pick one visual icon which, with no captions or description  whatsoever, summarises Whitlam's administration and its impact, it would be 

  1 

  Blue Poles, he says. More than a quarter of a century later, it still reveals  where on the spectrum of political opinion an individual lies. 

  There are two reactions to it, he elaborates. The most common can be read  on the faces of people minutes before they speak. With a shake of the head  and a click of the tongue, they'll turn to you with a resigned expression and  mutter, "My grandson brings better than this home from kindergarten." If 

  he had a dollar for every time he heard that, my friend complained, he could  have bought the painting himself. 

  Interestingly enough, the second-most common comment is not really the  opposite. 

  Rather it is two questions - "How much did they pay for that again?"  Followed immediately by, "And how much is it worth now?" With a  mischievous grin, the young security guard confides in me that he likes to  pause a little after answering, before softly adding, "I wish I had a four  thousand percent return on investments after thirty years." 

  Blue Poles, he continues, is a metaphor for the Whitlam Government itself.  You see, the "art" in Blue poles lies in the motions and actions of the artist in  making it, a graceful, intense fluidity, leaving no inch of the canvas  untouched. The strokes shape and reshape a masterpiece. Looking at it, one 

  sees the motions of the painter and the patterns of his movement. You can  see the hours spent in standing over and around the canvas, never hesitating,  never wondering if it will work or if the finished piece will be popular. He  was only concerned that the finished product would be the best thing that 

  he could possibly make. 

  Those flourishes, those sudden flashes of insight, live on today. What  resonates, even now, is the excitement, the passion, the sheer rapture that  caught an artist, and, for us, a nation. Like the spatters and curves on the  canvas, today we can still see those grand movements and elegant accidents  on the social fabric of our nation. And, said the young'un, in the memories of  you golden oldies. 

  So what are the images that you have of this government that ended before  you were born, I asked? To me, he said, what is striking is that people still 

  2 

  have strong opinions about the constitutional crisis that caused the sacking  of the Whitlam Government. People who lived through it still want to talk  about it. It is one thing to read a legal summary of the events that led up to  the sacking of a government. But it is another to watch the animation of  those who were there at the time and who felt and still feel the resonance 

  of such a momentous event. They must have known at the time that the  events which were occurring would become the cultural imagery of a nation  and be writ on the psyche of generations to come, just as Blue Poles is. 

  They were exciting times. The decisions taken by the Whitlam Governments  in their three short years in power became, and remain, essential parts of  Australian life and Australian Government administration. Like those drawn  to the painting in the National Gallery, we see different things on the  canvas, different brush strokes or spatterings leap out at us. We all have  our lists of great achievements. 

  What has struck me deeply in the last weeks is the language that is now  being used to describe those times, both in the media and by those to whom  I have spoken. Here are some of the phrases: courage, dynamism, a sense  of excitement, a sense that all things were possible, optimism, new ideas, 

  visionary, leadership, society blossomed, an inclusive and positive view of  society, uplifting, proud to be an Australian. 

  The passion and participation of those times is contrasted with the  disease/dis-ease which currently afflicts us. The dead hand of pragmatism  has given rise to dis-illusionment, dis-empowerment and moral dis­ embowellment. We live in a Cold Comfort farm world, dominated by a bull, 

  Big Brother, and his herd: Feckless, Aimless and Graceless. 

  The words that most capture for me the difference are those of John  Robertson, Secretary of the NSW Labor Council, in conversation with Terry  Lane on The National Interest recently1. Robertson was upbraided by Mark  Latham for supporting Labor for Refugees. Latham accused him of being out  of touch with trade union members and with the population at large because  polls carried out by the Labor Council itself showed little support. Polls,

  3 

  according to those who would share such views, determine what can and  cannot be said, or done, or writ in policy. 

  John Robertson's reply was that the polls "demonstrate that there is a long  way to go in changing people's perceptions of refugees". For Robertson, polls  show us the gap between where people are and where we would like them to  be. Latham's pragmatic cynicism is today's political currency. Robertson's 

  humaneness and concern for "the sort of country we have today" exemplifies  the driving forces of the Whitlam Governments. We set out to change  things. We had a sense of the possibility of change and a vision of the sort  of country we wanted to be a part of, a citizen of. 

  It was a time when one was proud to be an Australian. It was a time when  Australia was respected in the United Nations, when Whitlam's stature as a  global statesperson was likened to that of the other great political and  moral leaders of the time: Olaf Palme and Willy Brandt. It was a time when 

  Australia had close links with the Non-Aligned Countries and had even  quietly discussed the possibility of having observer status at non-aligned  meetings. Our Euro-focus was balanced by our recognition of and relations  with emerging major powers such as China and India and of our sensitivity to  the injustice of the global mal-distribution of resources. We committed  ourselves to the global benchmark of 0.7 per cent of our GDP to be allocated  to development assistance. 

  During that time, Australia became a nation. The Whitlam Governments  changed our perceptions of the role of the Commonwealth in people's lives,  changed our understanding of what was possible and appropriate for the  Commonwealth to undertake. In Blacktown, on the 13 November 1972, 

  Whitlam had said: "Until the nat ional government became involved in great  matters like schools and cit ies, this nation would never fulfil its real  capabilities"2 â¢ 

  In a leap of the imagination, the horizons of Australian people were lifted  and they were gathered into a nation. Whilst nationhood was about equity in  access and opportunities, it was also about inclusion. We drew the lines of  exclusion differently as we become a nation, drawing into citizenship, and

  the pr actices of citizenship, the hitherto excluded, marginalised and  silenced: Aborigines, migrants, women, artists, the poor [and the homeless].  Categories of social differentiation were abolished: illegitimacy, men who  have sex with men, de facto couples, battered women. Men, women and 

  children that we had not wanted to see were rendered visible, tearing down  some of the barriers of the mentality of Them and Us. We became more  skilled at seeing ourselves in the Other. 

  There was a passion about po litics. The Whitlam Governments had a clear  commit ment to social justice, and to global justice, and a strong sense of  purpose. Peter Wilenski said of the Whitlam years: "If they carry a single  lesson for reformers, it is of the possibility of political action - of the range  of activity that can be undertaken by a persistent and persevering reform  government"3. At no time during those years did Labor hold parliamentary 

  power yet it did not abandon its program of social reform. 

  And the Whitlam Governments were firmly reformist. Their major concern  was with the inequalities which existed in Australian society, inequalities in  access to education, health, housing, employment, services, decision making,  whatever inequalities were identified, and what ever their origin, be it of 

  income, gender, race, age, power or other social cleavages. 

  I do not concur with the myth that the Whitlam Governments did "too much,  too soon". That is to forget how far behind the rest of the developed world  Australia had slipped with respect to social legislat ion, programs and  benefits. Most of the changes were common currency in democracies  elsewhere. All were needed. All were introduced into parliaments where the  opposition held the balance of power through controlling the Senate. Both  the formulation and implementation of these policies were seriously  affected by the disruptiveness of Labor not being able to govern for a full 

  term, and by a conservative bureaucracy, a highly political group in its upper  echelons with their own str ong class and gendered views on major policy  issues. 

  The opening of the national imagination about what was possible drew  thousands of people into social and political activism. These were people

  who, irrespective of party affiliation, had never been interested in political  activism before or who had never thought that social change could be  brought about through their own actions. The generation of this feeling  that change was possible was arguably more important that the actual  reforms achieved. 

  It was for women. The dreary and debilitating social conformity of the 50s  had crushed women's spirit. We knew what was wrong with our lives but we  did not believe that such things could be changed. In the words of C.  Wright Mills, we did not know how to turn "private troubles" into "public 

  issues". 

  Then suddenly, as Julia Ryan, a member of the Women's Liberation  Movement, describes it, "there was this feeling that something couldbe  done: let us set up a woman's health centre, or a rape counselling service, or  a woman's refuge, or whatever, and let us do it ourselves". There was a  freeing of the spirit of the country, and certainly of that part of the  country that had been subdued and silenced for so long. They were  empowering times. 

  Women, amongst others, took on the State and demanded from it not only  their rights but also respect and entry into its spaces on their terms. These  terms were new: argumentative, collective, children accompanied, and moral.  They went against the grain of convention. Politicians and bureaucrats felt  uncomfortable, or even transgressed, and not only in their office spaces. 

  They were forced into the bedrooms of the nation, and household issues  became public issues to be addressed by public goods. 

  The taking on of the State split the Women's Liberation Movement and gave  life to the Women's Electoral Lobby. There was genuine debate, conflict at  times, about reform versus revolution, about the possibility of changing from  within a system so insensitive or worse to women and their lives, about the  possibility of benevolence or good will in the patriarchy, and about, in the  words of the feminist poet and activist, Robin Morgan, the laying of one's  head on the pillow each night next to that of the oppressor4.

  Few of the women who flocked to the Women's Electoral Lobby or other  forms of political activism were experienced public figures. We were  pensioners, teachers, students, part-time workers, tutors, wives and  mothers. We had only accidental connections to power, through the sharing  of a pillow or a lineage, sometimes through the making of afternoon tea at  other people's political meetings. Few of us had, as a training ground 

  membership, in the traditional women's organisation: the National Council of  Women, the Country Women's Association or others. 

  Meetings would allocate tasks: go interview a politician, go and write a  submission, take a plane to Melbourne to attend a meeting and so on. We  most of us had ever done such things before. Heart in mouth we accepted  the task. We set out intrepidly but quaking inside. We moved from  demonstrating outside the system to a new world of working within political  arenas. 

  In good faith, many women moved into the public service in order to assist in  bringing about the changes that women wanted and needed in their lives.  They brought with them women's ways of doing things and formed new and  different coalitions and strategic alliances between the insiders and the  outsiders. The activism and the demands on the outside opened up the  spaces in which the women on the inside could argue, and win, changes in 

  policy and in its implementation. 

  The insider/outsider relationship of these coalitions and alliances was often  difficult, both for the women on the inside and also for the women who had  chosen to continue to work for change from outside of the system.  Reflecting on the Third National WEL Conference in 1975, Juliet Richter 

  pointed out that women had entered the power structure "in the hope of  being able to further some of the aims of the women's movement. Some  actually manage to do this, but they are open at all times to charges from  their sisters of tokenism at worst, compromise at best". She called for a  constructive relationship between the women's movement within government  and without: 

  The alternatives are not uplifting to contemplate: nothing but  careerist women in charge of government funds, doing nothing but  shoring up the status quo, and cut off from or in a hostile relationship 

  7 

  to a pure movement of dedicated feminists, isolated, impotent in its  splendid opposition.5 

  Too soon the women on the inside found themselves caught in the conflicts  and contradictions of radical advocacy versus the canons of bureaucratic  "objectivity" or "impartiality", between employment as a means to achieving  social justice and employment as a career. Advocates against the grain of  the status quo rarely get promotions and rewards. 

  Over the coming decades, Juliet Richter's fears were to be realised. The  machinery established within government to advocate and address women's  needs, to enable women to tell governments what they wanted, was coopted  by government and turned into the mouthpiece of government. The women's  movement no longer struggles to work with those within the system in some  form of informed even if oppositional partnership. There has been  resistance to this cooptation of the women's machinery for party-political  ends, but it has been sporadic. 

  There were fewer conflicts and contradictions for the Ministerial advisers,  government advisers and consultants working in the think tanks and other  advisory bodies. The Whitlam Labor governments attracted, and recruited,  people who shared their vision of a different Australia and who shared their 

  determination to contribute to bringing it about. They surrounded  themselves with people of talent and energy, with people with a deep concern  for issues of justice, for Australia's cultural identity. We were student  politicians, academics, business men, artists, journalists, all sorts of people.  What we did, or our class lineage, were not defining characteristics, as it is  for the Establishment. Not even our party affiliations or non-affiliations6 .  We were identified by our beliefs and our commitment to fairness and  equity. We were listened to because of our competence, and our advice  seriously considered, no matter how much it diverged from the conventional

  or the familiar. This was as true of James Mollison when he recommended  the purchase of Blue Poles as it was in my own case. 

  Being a staffer or adviser was not then, as it is now, a training ground for  getting yourself into politics. Most, perhaps all, of those who were staffers  or advisers in those times would have been what we now call public  intellectuals. We would not have felt at ease with such a description but in  our midst were many thoughtful, concerned and articulate people, people in  tune with their communities, with people's aspirations and dreams, with the  quality of people's lives, the ugliness and the uplifting. 

  However, the use of the term does throw light on some of the problems we  now face. Edward Said defines a public intellectual as someone who speaks  truth to power7â¢ It is implicitly assumed in the definition that the public  intellectual is an Outsider. In Whitlam's time, space was created inside for  the speaking of truth to power. We were all expected to act like this. More  recently, Said has also spoken of the representative function of the public 

  intellectual: where there are people who seek justice, freedom,  development, there the intellectual stands to make possible or to enhance  the formulations of their expectations and desires8. 

  In Whitlam's days the country was alive with demands for justice and  freedom and inclusion and equity. There was an impor tant representative  role for public intellectuals then. Now the role demands the great courage  of speaking truth to manipulative and indifferent power. 

  The long years of careful development of a programme to put to the people  for endorsement, and the freeing of the demanding voices, the prophetic  and dissenting voices, ensured that the Whitlam Governments were  responsive governments, in dialogue and debate with the people of Australia. 

  They led by working synergistically with what was happening in the  community, responding to the demands of the newly recognised voices as well  as of the more traditionally articulate. They were enabling governments at

  once stimulating and supporting social change. John Robertson would have  felt at home. 

  The practice of bringing competent and committed people into Ministerial  offices initially generated suspicion amongst public servants. But one of the  most significant marks of the Whitlam governments was the valuing of the  public service and of its management . The opening words of Peter Wilenski's 

  book on Public Power and Public Administration capt ure the stance9 : 

  The quality of modern government, and the or ganisations and people  that constitute and staff its administration, make a major  contribution both to the economic growth of the nation and to the  social and cultural welfare of its citizens. 

  Whilst there were many among the senior and middle level public servants  who were resistant or opposed to the policies instituted by the Whitlam  Governments, there were others who shared the excitement of change. The  oppressive traditionalism of twenty three years of conservative governments  had brought conformity and an unwillingness amongst public servants to be  critical. Vested economic and political interests had determined the range  of the possible. Then suddenly debate and discussion of issues was  encouraged and policies opened up for review. This fostered quality and led 

  to good and productive working relationships between such public servants  and government staffers and advisers. The principles of social justice were  applied to the public service and led to greater family and people friendly  working conditions in the public service. 

  The Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration was to  conclude that "the present characteristics of the "career service" enables  the administration to function to some degree as a self-contained elite group  exercising power generally in the interests of the st atus quo but without  effectively being accountable for its exercise"10. This is not to say that 

  public servants ignored the public interest but rather that their frame of  reference for interpreting what lay in the public interest arose out of their  background and experience.

  This frame of reference was to affect my job and to force me to work in  particular ways. A concern for women's lives did not form part of the stat us  quo. A sensitivity to women's issues was rare at any level of the public  service, except among some women. The achievement of gender sensitive  equity had to be the basis of administrative reform, to become an  administrative value and a factor in the evaluation of public sector  performance. 

  One of the first tasks assigned to the public bureaucracy was to draft for  my signature replies to the flood of lett ers that I received each week from  women, women in the cities and countryside, and from all cultural and socio­ economic backgrounds. By 1975, I was receiving more letters that any other 

  member of the Government except the Prime Minister. So many of them  said, in one way or another: Thank goodness there is finally someone to  whom I can talk. 

  In writing these letters, women were trying to turn their private troubles  into public issues. It was not long before I realised that the letters drafted  for my s ignature were restatements, even justifications, of the status quo.  At best, they were terse patriarchal pats on the head and mutterings of  "There. There. It's OK." Epistolary equivalents of a prescription for Valium. 

  At worst, they were quite offensive in their arrogant assertion of the status  quo: nThat is the way life is. Stop complaining." Not only were the tentative  pleas for help of these women being cast aside, if I had signed those letters  I would have become another mouthpiece of the status quo. 

  Perhaps the most time consuming strategy for administrative reform was  the decision to use these drafts as a means of changing the practices, and  hopefully the heads, of the public servants. Each draft was critiqued and a  note prepared for the drafter and his or her bosses about the kind of reply  that was required. No letter was s igned and sent until it was responsive and 

  expressed a willingness to take the matter seriously and indicated how this  was to be done. In the insistence on the drafting and redrafting of  correspondence, the links between public policy and public administration  were being forged and an early focus was placed on the proper 

  implementation of public policy. 

  11 

  Compared to the enormity of this task, the design and establishment of  bureaucratic machinery to ensure that matters of importance to women  were more adequately dealt with in the bureaucracy seemed fairly easily  manageable. 

  The form it had to take emerged from the correspondence strategy. No  government activity is gender neutral, not even the draft ing of  correspondence. A II parts of the bureaucracy had to have the capacity to  perform in a gender responsive manner. No document should be drafted  that was not gender sensitive. Every policy to be brought to Cabinet needed  to be vetted for its gender responsiveness and impact on women. All policy 

  implementation mechanisms and programmes need to ensure a gendered  equity of outcome and access. The "hub and spokes" model, or the "wheel of  women's affairs" model, of bureaucratic machinery designed to increase the  likelihood that matters of concern to women would be adequately addressed  came into existence11â¢ 

  The Whit lam Governments were social reformist governments. They set out  to address women's issues and to bring women into the employ of the State. 

  But women knew that, whi le reforms to address the inequalities and  structural discrimination facing women were essential , even if achieved they  would not be sufficient to improve the quality of women's lives. We had to  carefully think through what were, as feminists, our objectives and identify  what could be achieved through the State. Extensive consultations  throughout Australia, and the extraordinary glimpses into women's lives  provided by the letters, led to a set of principles to guide the program for  women. 

  The aim was to give all women the opportunity to choose freely, and to be  able to live, the kind of life that best suited them, be that as wives,  mothers, workers, artists, act ivists or what ever. The role of the State was  identified as bringing women to the threshold of choice about their life, to a 

  position from which they would be able to set about living a decent life.

  Child care, health services for women, equitable workforce conditions,  equitable educational opportunities, an assured minimal income and  protections from violence were essential to bring women to the threshold of  financial and emotional independence, to the possibility of sufficient peace  of mind to look at and reflect on their lives, their values and their wishes for  the future12â¢ Only through measures such as these would it be possible for  women to move from dependence on husband and the State to the threshold  of autonomy. 

  This threshold theory of the Whitlam years was a precursor to Amartya  Sen's, and later Martha Nussbaum's, concept of human capabilities. In the  first of the UNDP Human Development Reports, it is argued that human  development concerns the formation of human capabilities through access to 

  income and employment opportunities, education and health, and a clean and  safe environment. It also concerns the use of these capabilities, be it for  work, leisure or for political or cultural activities. 

  However, we realised that for women's choices to be truly free, women hC!~  to be conscious of how society's expectations shaped, if not determined,  such choices. The nature and extent of sexism in our society had to be  understood and changed. The threshold would not be a threshold to 

  autonomy if there were not also radical social change. Thus the most  difficult challenge facing us was to identify the revolutionary changes, the  changes which would lead to structural changes in social values and norms,  that were needed. We also had to reflect on whether the State could play a  role in bringing about such changes. 

  The threshold changes achieved during the short and continually disrupted  years of the Whitlam Governments were extra-ordinary. I do not want to  list them now. They can be found, for example, in the pages of Marian  Sawer's book Sisters in Suits or in my essay in the The Whit/am 

  Phenomenon, titled "Creating a Policy for Women". These changes are the  some of the bold brush strokes of the canvas of the Whitlam years.

  What I want to talk about are some of the revolutionary changes achieved  by the State in those years, in particular, the changes in social values and  community attitudes achieved by The Royal Commission on Human  Relationships and International Women's Year. 

  Elizabeth Evatt and others have talked about the Royal Commission into  Human Relationships but it is worth reflecting on what an extraordinary role  this was for the State to play: to seek to better understand the nature, the  richness and the perversity of interpersonal relationships in our society, to  create public discussion and debate about the unspoken and the unspeakable,  and to determine where the State could intervene to improve the quality and  extent of such relationships. Whilst attention is often focused on the last  of these objectives, which was addressed in the recommendations of the  Commission, the request to the Commission to present interim reports was  made to ensure that the two earlier objectives were also achieved. The,  Commission's decision to hold hearings and seek submissions from all around  Australia contributed to the achievement of these much more radical social  objectives, as Anne Deveson so richly documents in her book on the work of  the Commission, Australians at Risk. 

  The other explicit State instrument of radical social change was the  International Women's Year programme whose Parliament-approved aim was  to change public attitudes towards women. The approach was three­ pronged: the empowerment of women, the change within, attitudinal change,  changes in the social norms and values that constrained or distorted women's 

  lives, and the freeing and strengthening of women's creativity. The  instrument was a grant programme whose funds could only be used for  initiatives which would contribute to the achievement of these objectives  and its mechanism was itself empowering and participative: people  themselves had to work out what they thought might bring these things  about and argue their case for any required funds. 

  What is equally striking about all this is that the Whitlam Governments, and  in particular the Prime Minister, "allowed" all this to happen. The first act  of courage was the decision to create a position on his staff for an adviser  on this uncomfortable and then still emerging great social movement of our  time. The second was to appoint me, someone whose ideology was avowedly  that of the women's liberation movement, someone who had work on abortion

  law reform and homosexual law reform in the days of issues politics, whose  training was in Philosophy, and whose life experiences and family traditions  were of principled political activism. I was also a Catholic, not a member of  the Labor Party, separated from my husband and child, I did not have a  great dress sense and I swore. 

  In 1972, the Labor Party went to the elections without even being conscious  that they did not have a policy on women. The Prime Minister, as he himself  said yesterday, was a child of his times and those times were not yet  sensitive to women's lives and aspirations. I and those others who were with 

  me were not working in an empathetic environment. But we were working in  an environment totally shaped and determined by principles, the principles of  social justice and equity, and with politicians whose understanding was  grounded in the reality of people's lives, even if this was often blokes' lives! 

  They were neither governed, nor cut to shape, by pollsters and spin doctors.  For as long as we could argue the case for women from these principles, and  from international conventions and declarations, we were listened to and our  advice was accepted and acted on. 

  What we did not realise is that at the same time that we women were  discovering the State, the blokes were re-making the State. They moved up  the hi ll to a new building, more about confrontational politics than consensus  politics. They discovered markets and the so-called free forces, which are 

  really blokes' forces. The pursuit of the public good was replaced by the  pursuit of individual self interest.
