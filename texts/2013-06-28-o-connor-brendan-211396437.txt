 THE HON BRENDAN O’CONNOR MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP   

 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Friday, 28 June, 2013    

 MORE SRI LANKANS RETURNED TO COLOMBO 

 A further 22 Sri Lankan irregular maritime arrivals have been returned to Colombo after failing to  meet Australia’s international obligations, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Brendan  O'Connor, said today. 

 The group departed Christmas Island on Thursday. Their return takes the number of Sri Lankans sent  home to 1270 - 1057 of them involuntarily since August last year. 

 Mr O’Connor said returning the group to Sri Lankans sends a powerful message. 

 “The government is making it crystal clear that those who pay smugglers are throwing their money  away and risking their lives in the process,” Mr O'Connor said. 

 “We are committed to breaking the evil people smuggling trade, deterring people from taking  dangerous journeys by boat and saving lives at sea. 

 “When people arrive in Australia without authorisation, any claims they make for their reasons to  travel to Australia are assessed by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. 

 “If these claims are not covered by Australia’s international obligations, they will be returned to their  homeland wherever possible. 

 “There is no visa on arrival, there is no speedy outcome, and there is no special treatment. 

 “We will continue to transfer people to Nauru and Manus Island.” 

 People returned involuntarily do not have access to reintegration assistance.
