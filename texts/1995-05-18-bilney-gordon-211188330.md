 ASSISTANCE TO REPATRIATE INDO-CHINESE ASYLUM SEEKERS

 Australia will provide $ 1.5 million to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  (UNHCR) for the Comprehensive Plan of Action for Indo-Chinese Asylum Seekers (CPA), the  Minister for Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney, said today.

 The funds will be used for repatriation and information activities for Vietnamese and Laotian asylum  seekers in camps in South East Asia. This brings to $9.7 million the total contributed by Australia to  the CPA since its inception in 1989.

 "The CPA was developed in 1989 under UNHCR auspices by the International Conference on  Indo-Chinese Refugees, in response to the large numbers of people leaving Vietnam and Laos," Mr  Bilney said.

 "It was recognised that as long as there was an expectation of automatic resettlement in the West, the  dangerous and clandestine migration would continue.

 "The CPA has successfully established procedures for fair and orderly determination of refugee status  and third country resettlement of those granted refugee status is almost complete. Regular migration  arrangements are now in place and clandestine departures from countries of origin have virtually 

 ceased.

 "Return of non refugees is now the major challenge facing the CPA in its final year, with about  56,000 Vietnamese and Laotians currently in camps. Most have been denied refugee status and are  awaiting repatriation - some have been in the camps for more than five years," Mr Bilney said.

 The Australian grant will be earmarked as follows: â¢ $lm for repatriation of Vietnamese asylum seekers â¢ $400,000 for repatriation of Laotian asylum seekers â¢ $100,000 for information activities to assist repatriation and deter further departures.

 "The UNHCR and non government organisations are confident that repatriation is proceeding  relatively smoothly - more than 69,000 Vietnamese have been repatriated since 1989.

 "This Australian assistance will include health programs and individual assistance for returnees such  as rice, tools and seeds," Mr Bilney said.
