 RICHARD MARLES MP 

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 QUESTIONS FOR SCOTT MORRISON 

 

 For the second day in a row, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has refused to answer  important questions in the nation’s Parliament about what is happening on our borders.    

 Once again, the Minister was given the opportunity to tell the Australian people the  truth. Once again, he failed.    

 Again, I call on the Minister to the questions that all Australians deserve the answers to.    

 Can the Minister confirm reports that asylum seekers from Somalia arrived in Darwin  earlier this week? How many asylum seekers arrived, and were any children onboard?  What is the welfare of the passengers?   

 How many boats have been successfully turned back to Indonesia since the election?  How many attempts at turn backs have failed?   

 If the Minister is unable to comment on successful and unsuccessful turn backs, why  was he able to comment last weekend, in relation to a boat in distress off the coast of  Java? What has changed between last Saturday and today?   

 If the Minister is unable to comment on “on water operational matters”, why has he  released two statements relating to “operational matters” over the past week, outside of  his regular briefing? Can the Minister clarify what is and isn’t an “operational matter”?   

 How many fishing boats has the Government purchased since the election? How much  did they cost?   

 Does the Minister have a subscription to the Jakarta Post?
