 SPEECH ey THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION AND YOUTH AFFAIRS, SENATOR SUSAN RYAN, FOR THE LAUNCHING OF THE GREAT IMMIGRATION DEBATE  IN SYDNEY ON 21 SEPTEMBER 1984

 I want to begin by commending the Federation of Ethnic Communities*  Councils of Australia for its initiative in producing this book, The Great Immigration Debate. While the title might suggest  differences of opinion, the book reflects a surprising and heartening 

 convergence of views regarding the issue of immigration, particularly  in the present context of public discussion. This book is most welcome  for the refreshingly open and factual way it presents its arguments.

 The book provides information on the history of immigration and the  contribution of culturally diverse communities to Australia’s  development. This will make it an important contribution to the  acceptance of cultural diversity and to multicultural education in  Australia.

 The Federation is to be congratulated for the wide range of  contributors it has included in the book. We are presented with the  views of the major political parties, senior academics and represen­ tatives of Aboriginal, church, ethnic affairs, employer and union  groups. There is also an interesting selection of comments by 

 secondary school students. That section is particularly pleasing to  me, because it is today’s youth who will be forming the society of  tomorrow. It is their views, opinions and suggestions which are most  important for the shaping of tomorrow’s world.

 The Great Immigration Debate also includes among its wide-ranging  contents a statement by the Prime Minister in a speech to Parliament in  May this year. Let me quote from that speech. Mr Hawke said that  "One of Australia’s greatest achievements has been its acceptance of  people from widely diverse nationalities around the world” . "It is 

 imperative" he said, "that our debate be based on a clear understanding  of the facts and that the facts be presented honestly".

 I believe that the book we are launching today presents the facts in a  lucid and positive way. It will do much to fill an information vacuum  in the community generally and especially in our schools. It points to  a multicultural Australian society offering rich and varied choices of 

 lifestyles, diversity in relationships and exposure to other values and  points of view.

 'Multiculturalism’  is more than a descriptive term to designate a  society made up of different ethnic groups.  It is an approach to  policy formulation and resource allocation which seeks to provide for  equality of access, equality of opportunity and more equal outcomes.

 The multicultural society we are working towards will be a vital,  tolerant and progressive community in which all groups, be they of  Aboriginal, English-speaking or non-English-speaking background, make  an important contribution to the richness, the depth and the traditions  of our nation.

 The Federal Government is committed to a multicultural Australia. In a  speech to the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia  some months ago, the Prime Minister said, inter alia: “My Government brings unswerving and fundamental commitment to provide policies and to 

 take initiatives which develop Australia as a fair, harmonious and  progressive multicultural society. We want a society in which all  groups have the same rights, responsibilities and opportunities".

 This is particularly relevant and important in education. Our  education policies aim to redress past imbalances in the opportunities  available to migrants and refugees. We have added the Participation  and Equity Program, a program to reform secondary education and make it 

 appropriate for all students; a new program to improve the basic  skills in primary schools, particularly for groups such as migrants and  refugees; and a Quality of Education Review to assist the Commonwealth  to direct funds to improved outcomes for all students : these three are  added to the programs already in operation to help remedy disadvantage.

 The English as a Second Language Program, the Multicultural Education  Program and the Ethnic Schools Program are all being maintained. They  are being reviewed by the Commonwealth Schools Commission this year in  the context of a review of all the Commission's special purpose 

 programs. This review is essential if the Government is to make  effective improvements. It will evaluate the extent to which these  programs are meeting our objectives and priorities and the extent to  which the parents and communities concerned are, or should be, 

 consulted about, and involved in, the management or overseeing of  programs.

 It is in schools that we have the opportunity to provide education  which reflects the changing composition of Australian society and  develops the educational potential offered by a multicultural society.

 Acceptance of differences and appreciation of cultural variety appear  in the extracts from students’ writing included in The Great ImmiRra-  tion Debate.  For example, Mary, a Year 11 student at Kingston State  High School, Queensland, has this to say: ·

 " ... these migrants bring us knowledge and often contribute ideas  to the community".

 Lesley, a student in Year 12 at Balmain High School, says:

 " I accept Asians as part of my community. I think Asians are  warm, friendly people who are interesting to talk to and I  think their customs are unusual and delightfully  interesting."

 Of course not all students display such positive attitudes. I might  also quote Grant, a Year 9 student from Greenwood, Western Australia,   who would not welcome people from other countries:

 " ... unless they promise not to speak any other language but  ours."

 It is to combat just such lack of understanding that The Great Immigra­ tion Debate has been produced.

 Despite his attitude, Grant has hit on a most important, if not the  most important aspect of life in a multicultural society - language. I believe that provision both for acquisition of the host country’s  language - in this case English - and maintenance of the mother tongue 

 should be pursued.

 First language maintenance is important because language is an integral  part of identity. I believe, too, that learning a second language -  whether as an Indonesian learning English or an English-speaking  Australian learning Greek - involves broadening one's understanding of 

 the world. And I think that awareness of different perceptions and  expectations, as expressed in language, can lead to acceptance and  understanding of people who do not share one’s mother tongue.

 Cultural and linguistic enrichment is one aspect of the benefits of a  multicultural society. When it comes to language needs in, for  example, diplomacy, trade and finance, a multilingual society has  obvious strengths and resources on which to draw.

 You will be interested to know that data from the National Survey of  Language Learning in Schools, which my Department undertook in 1983,  will soon be available. This data will give the Government a firm  basis for planning language in schools.

 The Great ImmiRration Debate, as I stated earlier, will assist in  meeting an information need. In determining what is required to meet  information and other needs in multicultural education, the Government  - and in particular my Department - now has the services of the 

 National Advisory and Coordinating Committee on Multicultural Education.

 This committee, chaired by Professor Jayasuriya, has 12 members drawn  broadly from groups involved in multicultural education. One of our  members is FECCA's nominee, Anne Ekstein.

 You are no doubt aware that the functions of the Committee include  advising me on major requirements in implementing multicultural  education programs at a national level. It is also tasked with  identifying areas of need not being met, and making recommendations on  new initiatives in areas such as the educational needs of ethnic  minorities, language issues, education for intercultural understanding

 and the provision of a clearing house and information exchange on  multicultural matters.

 I believe that through this Committee and the initiatives taken by  groups such as the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils, we can be  confident that multicultural programs and activities will be monitored  and reviewed and that needs will be met.

 The publication of this book, through the initiative taken by the  Federation, is an indication of community concern to ensure that  unbiased information is made available to students in our schools.

 I welcome the appearance in print of The Great Immigration Debate. I believe that teachers will find it a valuable resource and I wish the book every success.
