 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,   7 FEBRUARY 2005 

 

 E & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:  Cornelia Rau; Peter Qasim   

 

 FERGUSON:  I think the main point coming out of this is that under Labor this  wouldn’t have occurred.  We went to the last election with a policy that there’d be  independent access for the media and for medicals.  As well as that, of course, after 90  days there’s a policy that each person would be assessed month after month of their  continued detention.  As well as that, an independent inspectorate with the support of the  independent committee that currently exists.  So, I think that’s one of the fundamental  starting points that this situation which has went on for many months would simply not  have occurred.   The Minister today is referring to medical reports in Queensland.  The  reality is, indigenous Australians and people in detention thought that she had serious  problems.  Why contracted and departmental medical people didn’t know that, I don’t  know.   

 JOURNALIST: Should you wait until the inquiry does come out, though?   

 FERGUSON:  There’s a few questions about the inquiry.  The Prime Minister, at  this stage, has failed to clarify what kind of inquiry.  Quite frankly, on the Department’s  role up to now, you’ve got grave doubts about how it’s being handled.   

 JOURNALIST: So, will you move for a Senate inquiry?   

 FERGUSON:  We’ll be moving that way, yes.   

 JOURNALIST: So, the Labor Party will move for a Senate inquiry?   

 FERGUSON:  I’ll be at the Shadow Ministry this morning.  Over the weekend the  Leader of the Party’s indicated there’s a need for a public inquiry.     

 JOURNALIST: Have you had any talks with the minor parties or will you today?   

 FERGUSON:  Not at this stage.  I think you’ve seen on the record the comments  by the Democrats that they’re gravely concerned about this matter.  I think the general  public is, quite frankly. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Senator Vanstone said this morning that it was understandable that  some authorities may have thought that she was an unlawful citizen, initially?   

 FERGUSON:  The reality is the Immigration Department could go through its  records; they could trace the number of German-speaking women of this age group who  have overstayed in this country.  I think there wasn’t enough effort put into  investigations.  You know, we’ve got a preposterous situation now where she’s saying 

 that if people do speak a second language and we don’t know who they are, we’ll shove  them Baxter, not good enough.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you think a Senate inquiry will highlight more cases or similar  cases?   

 FERGUSON:  I can’t be confident of that.  The situation is that in this case, a  person on the missing persons list, a person who Aboriginal Australians feels has massive  problems, and a person who detainees feel has massive problems, I hope that’s not too  frequent, all those separate things coming together.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you think you’d have support from the Democrats and the  Greens on this?   

 FERGUSON:  I would have thought so.  I think they’re treating it very seriously.   

 JOURNALIST: What do you think should be done with the man who’s been in  detention for more than six years?  Do you think he should now be let out and given  residency in Australia?   

 FERGUSON:  Who are you referring to?  Which person?   

 JOURNALIST:  Peter  Qasim.  

 

 FERGUSON:  I wrote to the Minister some time ago.  I think there are grave  doubts about the bona fides.  If he is stateless indeed, we have a significant (inaudible) in  our system in this country.  That is why Labor’s had meetings with the Uniting Church  and the Refugee Council about a form of complementary protection.  There are some  major issues in his story as to his derivation.  But look, the Hotham Mission in  Melbourne is a classic example where, if we can get a proper system where people are 

 basically supervised and will participate in our system after their cases are further  considered, then Labor believes it’s got to go in that direction.   

 JOURNALIST: What do you mean, grave doubts about -?   

 FERGUSON:  Well, I think there’s some issues about Qasim; where he derives  from, parts of his story in regards to his history, quite frankly.   

 JOURNALIST: So, what do you think should be done about him?   

 FERGUSON:  I’m saying that Labor believes that if this country can develop a  system where people have been rejected by a very long process and cannot be deported,  those cases, and it’s a very limited number, then we have to look at the possibility of  some form of guidance and counselling and processing through a group such as the  Hotham Mission.  We got to move in that direction.   

 JOURNALIST: But what about him?  What should be done about him now?   

 FERGUSON:  I’m saying with him, I’m saying up till now, Hotham Mission has  dealt with people with severe mental problems, not too loudly, not in neon lights.  The  Government has released a number of people to be under the auspices of that organisation  and they’ve had a good success rate.  That is an initiative, an embryonic situation that we  can look at in the future.  In (inaudible) to Qasim, I say there’s doubts about his bona  fides. I’m not judging that he is totally at fault, but there are doubts at this stage.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you think that the Government should apologise -   

 FERGUSON:  Sorry.  On this matter, the number of stateless people is a very  small number of the actual asylum claimants.  There are a few Palestinians, some Iraqis  and Mr Qasim.   

 JOURNALIST: But still, the individual cases are important to those people?   

 FERGUSON:  They are.  Of course they are.  But as I say, the Government has  been undertaking measures to see whether India and Pakistan etc would accept Mr  Qasim.  They seemed to have failed.  We can’t have him in detention forever in this  situation, no.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you think the Government should apologise to Ms Rau?   

 FERGUSON:  I don’t think it’s a fundamental question here, quite frankly.  The  Government stuffed up big time, the Minister stuffed up big time, and so has the  Queensland police, as far as I’m concerned.  The question is looking into what’s 

 happened, how it happened, and making sure it doesn’t happen again.   

 JOURNALIST: But don’t you think she deserves an apology, or her family  deserves an apology?   

 FERGUSON:  Her family are saying that they’re not even going to take legal  action for recovery of costs.  No doubt she can get costs, there’s no doubt about this.   Similarly, we’ve got the ridiculous proposition where she could actually be hit for costs  herself by this Government under the current rules. 

 

 JOURNALIST: But I think Amanda Vanstone says that won’t happen.   

 FERGUSON:  Well, I’m glad she’s assured us of that.   

 JOURNALIST: So, you don’t think that there should be an apology?   

 FERGUSON:  I’m saying that I don’t think it’s the fundamental question here.   

 JOURNALIST: But why are you so reluctant?   

 FERGUSON:  Because I think the Government probably has got arguments in  regards to litigation.  If there is no litigious aspects to this then they should apologise,  yes.  We are talking about very substantial costs - in the hundreds of thousands of dollars  here.  You know, quite frankly, I think the Australian people think she deserves it.  But  obviously, there are issues here.
