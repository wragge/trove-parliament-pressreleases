 Australia to provide Humanitarian Assistance to the Palestinian Territories

 Australia will provide food aid worth $2.6 million to help the current humanitarian situation in the Palestinian Territories.

 The situation in the territories remains serious and is marked by high rates of poverty, unemployment and malnutrition.

 Our food aid contribution is part of the ongoing relief and development assistance that Australia provides to the Palestinian people. Australia will contribute $1.6 million to the World Food Programme (WFP) and $1 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for food aid.

 WFP is currently targeting food aid to 500,000 Palestinians amongst the non-refugee population. Beneficiaries of this food aid will include the elderly, the chronically ill, people with disabilities, the long term unemployed and households headed by women.

 UNRWA, through its Emergency Appeal 2002 is providing food aid to almost 220,000 Palestinian families.

 The social and economic impact of the conflict in the West Bank and Gaza has been enormous.

 A nutritional survey carried out by CARE International reports significant levels of malnutrition and anemia in children under five. Recent UN estimates also indicate that over fifty per cent of the population has received some type of food aid, and around sixty per cent of the population is living on less than $4 ($US2) per day.
