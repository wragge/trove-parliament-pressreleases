  Media Release

  House of Representatives Standing 

  Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations

  

  12 November 1999

  

  Inquiry 
into mature-age workers Melbourne

  

  The House of Representatives 
Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workpla  ce Relations will be holding its next public hearings 
for its inquiry into issues specific to mature-age workers, in   Melbourne  over two days, 
starting at   9:30 am  on   Tuesday 16 November  in 
the Conference Room, Business Council of Australia, 16th Floor, 379 
Collins Street Melbourne. 

  

  The Chair of the Committee,   Dr Brendan Nelson , said: 
"The Committee has a very interesting program as we shall be hearing 
from the Council on the Ageing, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, 
the Business Council of Australia, the Hume City Council, two research 
organisations and several employment providers.

  

  "Many mature-age jobseekers have told the Committee 
they believe that employer attitudes make it harder for them to be re-employed.   Drake Consulting  has provided 
concrete data to confirm their views. None of the 500 employers surveyed 
by Drake said they would choose to employ managers and executives in 
their fifties. Up to 65% of companies say this group would be the first 
to go when they are retrenching staff. 62% of the organisations make 
most of their selections from the 31-40 age group, while 23% prefer staff 
in their forties.

  

  "The Committee will also be hearing from   Davidson & Associates . 
Its survey found that the older and more highly paid a person was prior 
to redundancy, the longer it took to find a new job.

  

  "The   ACTU  has suggested that 
Australia should consider flexible ways to encourage mature-age workers 
to consider phased retirement. It has cited a number of overseas examples 
for consideration."

  

  Dr Nelson added: "We are also hearing from several 
organisations, such as   the Hume City Council,  
which have highlighted the additional difficulties experienced by unemployed 
mature-age people from non~Enghsh speaking backgrounds. Many of these 
people, especially those who have come as refugees, found unskilled 
jobs initially in manufacturing and processing. In recent times, many 
firms in these industries have been mechanised, downsized, gone off-shore 
or even closed.

  

  "The Committee aims to identify why so many 
mature age people have difficulties in regaining employment after they 
lose their jobs and to find practical solutions to meet the needs of 
this age group."

  

  The Committee has received evidence from a number 
of witnesses at earlier public hearings in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, 
Adelaide, Brisbane and Canberra. Public hearing transcripts and most 
submissions are at   http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/eewr/OWK/index.htm

  

  Terms of reference

issues specific to workers over 45 years of age seeking employment, 
or establishing a business, following unemployment.
