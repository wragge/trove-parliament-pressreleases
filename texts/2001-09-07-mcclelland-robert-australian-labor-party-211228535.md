 Prime Minister Misrepresents Border Protection Bill Robert McClelland - Shadow Attorney-General

 Media Statement - 7 September 2001

 Comments by the Prime Minister today that the MS Tampa asylum-seekers issue would not be under consideration by the Federal Court if Labor had agreed to pass the government's Border Protection Bill are wrong, according to the Shadow Attorney-General.

 The Federal Court is currently exercising a jurisdiction guaranteed by the Australian Constitution. But as the Attorney-General admitted last week, the Border Protection Bill can not override those provisions of the Constitution which guarantee judicial review of decisions.

 Had the Bill been passed, there would have been the prospect of even more complex litigation challenging the validity of that law.

 The stated purpose of the Bill was "to provide for the removal of ships from the territorial sea of Australia". It simply did not address a situation where passengers on board a ship, the subject of a removal direction, are taken off that ship and placed on another - the course of action which the government ultimately undertook.

 The Bill would also not have been effective to prevent those on board the Tampa from making applications for protection visas, as no order was ever given for the removal of the ship from Australian waters.

 Even had an order been given, it only would have applied as and from the date of the direction. It would not have had a bearing on the matters being considered by the Federal Court of Australia.

 Labor has consistently indicated its preparedness to offer a bipartisan legislative response to the circumstances of the people previously on board the Tampa.

 Labor co-operated with the government on legislation to bring Kosovo refugees to Australia. Safe Haven legislation was passed with Labor's support to provide, among other things, that those people were not permitted to make applications for protection visas while in Australia.

 And under the previous Labor government, it was necessary to introduce remedial legislation to address

 the consequences of decisions of the federal courts on immigration matters - including relating to the detention of Cambodian asylum seekers in November 1991.

 It is quite wrong to suggest that the Border Protection Bill would have prevented court action, nor did it provide any additional legal authority for the course of action that the government ultimately adopted.

 Labor remains prepared to work with the government to put in place legislation to address the specific circumstances of those previously on board the Tampa should it be required. Authorised by Geoff Walsh, 19 National Circuit, Barton ACT 2600.
