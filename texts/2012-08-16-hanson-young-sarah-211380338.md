 MEDIA RELEASE    

 16 August 2012     

 ALP and Tony Abbot Coalition vote down time limits and welfare protections    

 Tonight the ALP and the Tony Abbott Coalition joined forces in the Senate to establish the ‘Gillard  Pacific Solution’, making way for the indefinite offshore detention of refugee children and their  families.    

 “Australians will be horrified when they awake to find that that the government has rushed through  cruel and shameful legislation that indefinitely dumps refugees and their children offshore instead of  offering them safety and protection” said Greens Immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.    

 “This evening the government exposed its empty rhetoric by systematically voting down four Greens  amendments which were common sense, consistent with international law and even drawn directly  from the Houston Report.    

 “The major parties have just handed the current and future governments a blank cheque to lock  Australia into offshore processing arrangements with no time limits, no real parliamentary scrutiny,  no review mechanism and no legally enshrined protections for refugees.    

 “Tonight I informed the Senate that at least 10 unaccompanied minors are amongst the 220 recent  arrivals on Christmas Island, and I asked Senator Lundy how dumping those children in Nauru is in  those children’s best interests?    

 “Minister Lundy’s answer, that it would be ‘unsustainable’ for the government to be required to act  in the best interests of the child, shows that protecting people is the last thing that this legislation is  about.    

 “Tonight we have witnessed the major parties rush through legislation that trashes our legal  obligations under the Refugee Conventions and makes a mockery of the Convention on the Rights of  the Child.     

 “This is an appalling day for Australia and a missed opportunity to finally set up a New Regional  Action Plan that gives people opportunities to safely apply for protection.     

 “Howard and Ruddock horrified many Australians with the Pacific Solution ten years ago - but  tonight Gillard and Bowen have outdone those cruel Coalition policies and delivered the Australian  people with a detention regime that is even worse.
