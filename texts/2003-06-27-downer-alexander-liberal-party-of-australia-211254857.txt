 MEDIA RELEASE  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER 

 AA 03 036 27 June 2003 

 Australian Support for Humanitarian and  Recovery Needs in Afghanistan

 I am pleased to announce the allocation of over $6.3 million of Australian funds to meet  ongoing humanitarian and recovery needs in Afghanistan, bringing our total assistance to  Afghanistan since September 2001 to almost $79 million.

 This assistance, to be delivered through the Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund and selected  UN agencies, is enhancing the ability of the Afghan Government to build a functioning and  stable state through the provision of essential services to the people of Afghanistan.

 Australia's aid to Afghanistan has been generous and is targeted at priority needs including  health, mine action, food security, basic education, and assistance for displaced and returning  Afghans.

 I was pleased to be able to discuss our program during this week's visit to Australia by the  Afghan Minister for Refugee Affairs, Mr Nazari.

 To support the daily operations of the Afghan Transitional Administration, Australia will  contribute $4 million to the Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund. The Fund is currently a major  source of revenue for the Afghan Transitional Administration, allowing it to employ teachers,  health workers and public officials and to fund essential services.

 In addition, over $2.1 million has been allocated to UN agencies to assist in recovery efforts,  principally in the areas of mine action, female health, and for reforms to Afghanistan's banking  system. Funding includes:

 â     $1 million to the UN Mine Action Service in Afghanistan - to help clear landmines in 

 populated areas and to allow the safe delivery of humanitarian aid; â     Over $850,000 to UNICEF's Afghanistan Safe Motherhood Program - to provide 

 support for emergency maternal health services in Afghanistan's western region; and â     $250,000 to UNDP to enhance the capacity of Afghanistan's Central Bank.

 Australia has also contributed $200,000 to the Information Counselling and Referral Service  for Afghan Returnees to assist returnees reintegrate back into Afghan society.

 Australia remains committed to assisting reconstruction efforts after more than 20 years of  conflict, especially Afghanistan's capacity to meet basic needs and to restore basic services to  its people.
