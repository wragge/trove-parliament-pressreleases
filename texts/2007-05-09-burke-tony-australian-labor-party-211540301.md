 MEDIA STATEMENT

 Government’s new asylum deal lures boats   

 Shadow Immigration Minister, Tony Burke today demanded the Prime Minister  immediately review his bizarre United States asylum seeker swap agreement in light of  reports of a surge in boats heading for the United States allegedly hoping to make it to  Australia.    

 Tony Burke’s comments follow international news agency, Reuters’ reports that the  number of Haitian boat people intercepted on their way to the United States has  skyrocketed - jumping from a mere five in March to 704 in April last month.  In fact,  Reuters reports more boat-people attempting the journey in April and May this year as  they did in all of 2006.    

 The massive spike in people fleeing Haiti for the United States has been linked to the  Australia-US refugee swap agreement announced last month by Kevin Andrews.   

 “If these reports are correct, Labor’s worst fears about the asylum seeker swap are now  being realised,” said Tony Burke.    

 “The evidence is now in that people-smugglers are using this agreement to lure desperate  people onto leaky boats.   

 “John Howard has handed people-smugglers a new marketing tactic,” said Tony Burke.     

 People intercepted in the Caribbean have confirmed that they heard about the Australia-US swap.  In fact, one Haitian was reported by Reuters as saying:   

 “I don’t know where it is, but they told me Australia is a rich country.”
