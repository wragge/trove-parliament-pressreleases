 Senator Annette Hurley LABOR SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA  SHADOW MINISTER FOR CITIZENSHIP AND  MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS 

 

 Tuesday, 23 May 2006

 

 New admissions in the tragic death of 2 year old   Richard Niyonsaba   

 A rare admission was revealed today by DIMA officials in the Legal and  Constitutional Senate Estimates committee.    

 It was placed on record by DIMA that the company assigned to DIMA’s refugee  settlement services, and the Niyonsaba family, received information about 2 year  old Richard’s health in an email before his arrival, but never opened it!   

 Richard Niyonsaba tragically died due to chronic health complications shortly  after arriving in Australia where he and his family were under the care of the  Australian Centre for Languages (ACL) Pty Ltd.   

 “The former Minister for Multicultural Affairs, John Cobb, informed us that an  email was sent to the service provider but this is the first we’ve heard of it not  being opened by ACL” stated Senator Hurley, Labor’s Shadow Minister for  Multicultural Affairs and Citizenship.   

 “We are happy that DIMA has introduced some new safe guards but it is a case  of too little, too late.”    

 “Why an email of such importance wasn’t opened by the service provider is of  major concern. There are also other areas of alarm surrounding this company’s  ability to provide adequate settlement services for refugees and this new  revelation from DIMA adds weight to the Labor Party’s call for an independent  inquiry into this tragedy” concluded Senator Hurley.
