 ALP Hypocrisy on mandatory detention: DEMOCRATS CALL FOR REVIEW OF POLICY The Democrats say recent allegations of mistreatment of asylum seekers in Australia's detention centres should encourage all political parties to oppose mandatory detention.

 Democrats’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said children and families who have not been convicted of any crime should not be subject to automatic, indefinite detention.

 “It is wrong to put all unauthorised arrivals behind barbed wire and particularly heartbreaking when they are children. Some children are born and raised in detention centres while their parents wait for the Government to decide if they can stay,” he said.

 “Australia is one of the few countries in the world which compulsorily detains all unauthorised arrivals indefinitely. This policy was introduced by the ALP and has been supported by both larger parties since that time.

 “Asylum seekers in detention centres have fewer legal rights than anyone else in Australia, including people in Australia's jails. They are not automatically entitled to legal assistance or even to visitors or contact with the outside world. They have no idea when they might be released and are frequently unable to contact even their immediate family.

 “Australia's insistence on locking up all unauthorised arrivals for prolonged periods of time is causing immense and unnecessary suffering, often to people who have already endured an enormous amount escaping persecution,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “The allegations of child abuse at Woomera detention centre are just the latest in a line of complaints and concerns expressed about the impact of Australia's detention regime.

 “Church and welfare agencies who care for people when they are eventually released frequently report stories of trauma suffered whilst inside the centres,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “Both larger political parties are still supportive of this inhumane,

 counter-productive and costly regime,” said Senator Bartlett.

 It has been reported that the Government has decided as part of its defence review to dramatically increase security at detention centres, turning the centres into top-security prisons with 12-metre-high reinforced solid metal fencing.

 “This is a grotesque waste of public money to try and paint asylum seekers as a defence and security threat,” said Senator Bartlett.
