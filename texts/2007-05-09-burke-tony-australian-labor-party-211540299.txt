        Member for Watson  Shadow Minister for Immigration,  Integration and Citizenship 

 

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP:  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA   

 9 MAY 2007    

 Subject:  Australia-US asylum swap deal; Haitian asylum seekers   

 

 E& OE PROOF ONLY   

 BURKE:  There will be other frontbenchers from the Labor Party who will come out later  on to talk about the budget.    

 But there’s a story that’s been breaking on the international wires that it’s important for  me to make a comment on immediately.    

 Reuters over the last couple days have been issuing reports that have now reached  Australia which have shown that Labor’s worst fears are being realised.     

 If these reports are true, then there is now a massive spike in people smuggling operations  specifically linked to John Howard’s refugee swap deal with the United States.   

 The number of Haitians fleeing to America in March before the swap deal was 5.  In  April that number spiked to more than 700.  We now have in one month more than the  entire number of people who came in the whole of the previous year.  One of the vessels  has gone down, and they are still counting the number of people who have drowned.    

 Five years ago, this precise deal was rejected by the Howard government.  Five years  ago, it was unthinkable that John Howard would promote a policy that would actually  have the impact of providing an incentive to people smugglers.    

 John Howard has given them their new marketing strategy.    

 He has to immediately review this policy.  It’s a dangerous policy.  And if this is what’s  being said around Cuba, around Haiti, there’s no doubt that people smugglers throughout  South-East Asia would be promoting this deal in the exact the same way.

  REPORTER:  So if you don’t get to Sydney, you could get to New York … (inaudible)   

  BURKE:  The Reuters reports, if accurate, have actually quoted asylum seekers.  One of  them has said, “I don’t know where it is, but they told me Australia is a rich country… I  think if a Haitian like me gets there, life will get better.”   

  There’s actually been a message sent throughout the world with the refugee swap is,  whether you go to the United States or whether you go to Australia, if you risk your life  on the high seas you’re going to end up in a wealthy nation.  It’s an extremely dangerous  policy that would have been unthinkable five years ago from John Howard.  He needs to  review it urgently and immediately.    

  REPORTER:   What was your initial reaction when you heard about it?    

  BURKE:  I didn’t believe the policy was true when I first heard it.  And then Kevin  Andrews went out and defended it.   

  What we have now are horrific figures, particularly the drownings.  Now, whether they  are specifically linked or whether that particular vessel would have taken off anyway, I  don’t think it’s fair to speculate on the drownings.    

  But there’s no doubt the spike in the number of people who have come, the number of  people risking their lives on the high seas, appears to be directly linked to this bizarre  policy which needs to be reviewed immediately.    

  ENDS.
