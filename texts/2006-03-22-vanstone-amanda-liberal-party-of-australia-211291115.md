 Australia Donates to Indian Refugee Women’s Protection Clinic

 22 March 2006

 A refugee clinic in India will continue to provide counselling to vulnerable women and children thanks to a $35 700 Australian Government  donation, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, announced today.

 Senator Vanstone toured the Refugee Women’s Protection Clinic in New Delhi, which helps mainly Afghani and Burmese women and children,  during her visit to India

 ‘The donation again demonstrates the Australian Government’s global commitment to helping vulnerable refugee women,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘By funding this clinic, the Australian Government will be providing these women with a safe and secure place where they can talk about issues  such as domestic violence or sexual and gender-based violence in their homes.

 ‘Australia can then step in and help the women and their children who are in most need of our assistance, to resettle in Australia under our  Humanitarian Program.

 ‘In 2005-06 about 13 000 refugee and humanitarian entrants most in need of resettlement will start a new life in Australia under the program.’ 

 The clinic was set up by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to provide a specialised venue for refugee women to  receive counselling and talk to UNHCR protection staff. 

 About 5000 refugee women aged 12 years and older are currently registered with the UNHCR in New Delhi. 

 By helping refugee women in the clinic, which opened last November, the UNHCR can quickly identify those who are in special need of assistance  and, if necessary, refer them to countries such as Australia for resettlement.

 ‘Since the introduction of the Woman at Risk category in 1989, more than 6000 visas have been granted for resettlement in Australia,’ Senator  Vanstone said.

 ‘This category is for refugee women and children who are identified as receiving or being at risk of abuse, are without the protection of a male  relative and are outside their home country.
