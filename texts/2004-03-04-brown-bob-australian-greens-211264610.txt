 Bob Brown, Senator for Tasmania   

 

 Fifteen people on Ashmore Reef don't deserve  Vanstone's 'cold hard reality' 

 4th Mar 04 

 The 15 people who arrived at Ashmore Reef today should be assessed  as refugees under Australia's immigration law, Greens Senator Bob  Brown said today.   

 "Amanda Vanstone's description of the people as '15 unauthorised  arrivals' is a cold-hearted rejection of their humanity and international  rights," Senator Brown said.   

 "If they are found not to be refugees the Minister should send them  home. But meantime they deserve humane consideration."   

 The Greens will give Labor another opportunity to support restoring  Ashmore Reef to Australia's migration zone when the Senate considers  migration detention legislation next week.
