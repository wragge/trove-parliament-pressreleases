 NO VACANCIES ON CHRISTMAS ISLAND - SO WHERE TO NEXT? 

 Mr Michael Keenan MP  

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs 

 Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  

 Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Michael Keenan has today called on the Rudd 

 Government to reveal how they intend to accommodate the growing number of asylum seekers, as facilities on 

 Christmas Island hit breaking point.  

 “The Rudd Government needs to reveal how much further the facilities on Christmas Island can be stretched 

 before they collapse,” said Mr Keenan.  

 “Boats are arriving at an almost daily rate; the Government needs to come clean with the Australian people and 

 outline their contingency plan to deal with arrivals once Christmas Island hits capacity.”  

 “If they don’t have a plan, they better get one soon.”  

 Mr Keenan’s warning follows the interception of another unauthorised arrival yesterday afternoon 4.8 nautical 

 miles north of Christmas Island, making it the fourth this year.  

 Since the Rudd Government’s changes in August 2008, 74 unauthorised boats have arrived in Australian waters, 

 with 3,105 people on board.  

 “The facilities at Christmas Island are already heavily reliant on the use of tents to house its occupants, but even 

 this makeshift solution has its limits.”  

 “As the surge in arrivals continues to pick up momentum, when can we expect the Government to start 

 processing people on the mainland?”  

 “At the rate the boats are coming, surely it’s only a matter of time.”
