 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 

 Greens move to end off-shore refugee processing 

 

 Senator Nettle, 4th October 2006 

 Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle will move and amendment to the Migration  Act to end "off-shore processing" on Nauru and Manus Island. The amendment will  be moved to the Migration Amendment (Visa Integrity) Bill 2006 link here when it  comes before the Senate. 

 "The recent rejection of the harsh changes to the Migration Act was a clear signal that  sending refugees to Nauru was no longer acceptable to either the Australian public or  parliament," said Senator Nettle. 

 "I welcome Tony Burke's statement today that "we should shut down Nauru", and  hope that this sentiment translates into Labor support for this amendment in the  Senate. 

 "I hope the parliamentarians who rejected the recent bill will be consistent in their  principles and now support this amendment. 

 "The amendment fixes the anomaly where an asylum seeker who lands on an island a  kilometre off-shore is sent to Nauru, whereas those who make it to the mainland are  processed in Australia. All asylum seekers should be processed in Australia. 

 "The Greens hope the community will lobby Senators to support this simple  amendment. 

 I hope that the parliament will choose to end the disastrous "Pacific Solution" and  back this amendment to the Act." 

 The Amendment: 3AA No offshore processing  

 It is the Parliament's intention that notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in  this Act, where this Act operates so as to detain any person:  

 â¢ (a) it is the right of that person to be detained in Australia; and   â¢ (b) it is the right of that person to take proceedings before a court for the  determination of the lawfulness of the detention and to be released if the court  finds that the detention is unlawful.
