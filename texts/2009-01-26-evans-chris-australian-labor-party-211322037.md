 Queensland welcomes 3400 new citizens in 60th anniversary  year 

 Monday, 26 January 2009 

 Queensland will today welcome 3400 new citizens in more than 60 citizenship  ceremonies across the state. 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, said that the new  citizens in Queensland are among more than 13 000 people who will become  citizens at 318 Australia Day ceremonies around the nation.  

 ‘Australia Day is a chance for all Australians to enjoy our nation's special day, and  celebrate being part of such a wonderful country,’ Senator Evans said.  

 ‘Becoming an Australian citizen shows commitment and loyalty to this country and a  desire to share a common future.  Australia has been enriched by the cultures and  traditions of people from more than 200 countries who have made a home in our  great nation. 

 ‘The common bond that unites us all is citizenship.’ 

 Queensland's new citizens include members of the Sibonio family, who are originally  from Burundi and came to Australia under the humanitarian program in 2006.   Father-of-eight Abel Sibonio, who volunteers to help other refugees, is proud that he  and three of his children are becoming Australian citizens on Australia Day. 

 ‘I want to contribute to the citizens of Australia and share my skills with the  community,’ Mr Sibonio said. ‘Australia is home now.’ 

 Senator Evans said that 2009 marks the 60th anniversary of Australian citizenship.  Since 1949, more than four million people have chosen to become Australian  citizens.  

 ‘This year marks an opportunity for us to reflect on the changes that have shaped  our nation over the past six decades, and a chance for all Australians to understand  the role citizenship plays in building a strong and unified nation,’ Senator Evans said. 

 Anneke Wood came to Australia in 1967 as a young girl with her family, who are  originally from the Netherlands. 

 ‘I'd been thinking about it for a while and this year being the 60th anniversary, I  thought it's a special year,’ Ms Wood said.
