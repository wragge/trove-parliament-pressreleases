 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS 

 The Hon Julie Bishop MP 

 

 18 December 2014 

 

 AUSTRALIA SECURES RENEWED HUMANITARIAN ACCESS TO SYRIA   

 The United Nations Security Council has unanimously adopted Resolution 2191 in  response to the appalling humanitarian situation in Syria. Australia, working with  Jordan and Luxembourg, co-authored and co-led negotiations on the resolution, which  will allow the UN to increase aid deliveries across borders and conflict lines.   

 The humanitarian situation in Syria remains dire due to the brutal campaign being  waged by the Assad regime against its own citizens. The situation has been made  worse by the consolidation of control by ISIL in eastern and northern Syria. There are  more than 3.3 million Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries and 7.6 million  internally displaced persons.   

 The resolution adopted today extends for a further 12 months the mandate for UN  agencies and their partners to use four specified border crossings into Syria for the  delivery of humanitarian assistance. It reiterates the Council’s demand on all parties,  particularly the Syrian regime, to cease attacks on civilians and respect international  humanitarian and human rights law. It will ensure the Council will continue to monitor  the situation and actions by parties to meet their obligations.   

 Australia has worked consistently during our 2013-2014 term to ensure the Council  supports efforts to address the humanitarian crisis in Syria, including co-authoring two  previous resolutions with Jordan and Luxembourg. We have provided $135.8 million in  assistance for those affected by the conflict since it began in 2011.
