 Tribute to Peter Andren   “The Conscience of the Parliament”  The passing of Peter Andren, the former Independent Member for Calare has deeply saddened his friend and colleague, Tony Windsor the Independent Member for New England.  “Peter  Andren  was  a  true  representative  of  the  people  of  the  Calare  Electorate,  a  man  of  the  highest  integrity and the ‘Conscience of the Parliament’.  Over the last six years we developed a strong friendship and respect of each other in standing up for our communities without fear or favour - something that Peter was passionate about.  Peter  was  an  energetic  and  enthusiastic  Parliamentarian  speaking  on  many  occasions  in  the  House  to  make sure that the people of Calare’s voice was being heard.  He  never  took  a  backward  step  when  it  came  to  representing  the  people  of  Calare  and  more  broadly  country Australians.  Peter worked to bring better accountability and transparency into parliamentary and electoral processes as well as to the expenditure of taxpayer’s money.  The Parliament will be the poorer for his passing,” Mr Windsor said.  Mr  Windsor  said  that  as  a  person,  Peter  was  true  to  his  word  and  his  reputation  grew  over  his  twelve  years as the Member for Calare.  “Peter was a compassionate person who was very proactive in helping people who needed help to deal with government bureaucracy or had difficulty helping themselves.  He campaigned on Human Rights issues with a strong commitment to Indigenous Australians and people less fortunate in our communities as well as refugees fleeing oppressive regimes in their homelands.  Peter  also  felt  a  deep  responsibility  for  ensuring  that  our  current  political  representatives  respect  our  environment to leave a legacy for future generations to enjoy and not to have to clean up because of their forefather’s actions.  I send my sympathy to his partner Valerie, his sons Greg and Josh and his wonderful staff.   We have lost a good friend and a great Australian,” Mr Windsor said.   TONY WINDSOR MP
