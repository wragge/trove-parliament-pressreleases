 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Of course it is not good enough but it’s typical of the Rudd Government that it’s doing everything on the  run. I mean, this is a tax which is a dagger aimed at the heart of our prosperity and they still can’t tell us  exactly what’s going to be in it. All of the details are apparently still up for grabs. The only things that it  seems are not up for grabs are the 40 per cent rate, the six per cent threshold and retrospectivity and yet  they’re the things that the resources companies are most interested in.    

 QUESTION:   

 Do you think it’s telling that Mr Rudd won’t be at the dinner tonight?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I think it’s telling that the Prime Minister is running away from challenges left, right and centre. He ran  away from a challenge twice in Parliament yesterday. He won’t face up the mining industry at a dinner  which he’s previously attended and I think it’s bad enough to have a Prime Minister who makes a series of  poor decisions but a Prime Minister who is not prepared to front people and explain his decisions, defend his  decisions, justify his decisions and instead plunders the Treasury for $38 billion to advertise his decisions,  well, that’s just wrong.    

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Rudd says Labor won’t compete in a race to the bottom on asylum seekers. Is the Coalition at the  bottom?

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 We want to protect our borders. We want to stop the boats. Now, the only way to stop the boats is to take the  sorts of measures which I have proposed. Now, I know that they’re tough but if you want to protect our  country you’ve got to be tough.   

 QUESTION:   

 What do you make of this $5 billion that’s remaining in the roll out of the BER? Should it be frozen?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 They should not spend any more money on the same basis that they have spent the $12 billion or so that has  been spent so far because there has been rip-off after rip-off in the previous spending and we’ve got to make  sure that we avoid the rip-offs in the future spending and the crazy thing is that the Deputy Prime Minister  has commissioned this report, this inquiry to find out what went wrong  and how the scheme should be  improved and she’s going to spend $5.5 billion without waiting for its report. I mean, that’s just crazy. Just  crazy. But, it shows the contempt that this Government has for due process. It shows the contempt they have  for proper accountability and, as I said, the more people understand about this program the more they think  that it is a crime against the tax payer.
