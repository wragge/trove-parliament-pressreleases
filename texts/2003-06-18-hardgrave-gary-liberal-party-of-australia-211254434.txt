 Media Release H79/2003 - 18 June 2003

 

 New Contract For Migrant English Language Tuition

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary  Hardgrave, today announced the awarding of a contract that  will provide English language tuition to nearly 2,000 migrants  and refugees in Canberra over the next five years. 

 The contract, between the Commonwealth and the Canberra Institute of Technology (CIT), represents a  commitment by the Commonwealth of $9 million over five years, beginning 1 July 2003. 

 It will deliver English language tuition to migrants and refugees from more than 60 countries and language  backgrounds.

 Nationally, the Federal Government has allocated more than $500 million over the next five years to the  Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP), including $114 million in the next financial year.

 Speaking at the contract signing ceremony, Mr Hardgrave said that the new contracts with AMEP service  providers in each state and territory would help more than 100,000 new arrivals on their journey to  successful settlement in Australia.

 'The Adult Migrant English Program is a vital component of the Government's commitment to 'nation  building,' community harmony and cohesion,' Mr Hardgrave said. 

 'It represents a significant investment by the Commonwealth in ensuring that new arrivals have every  opportunity to learn our national language, and so take the first and most important step towards full  participation in Australian society.'

 Locally, the contract with CIT will enable tuition delivery through the ACT Adult Migrant English Service  (AMES), centrally headquartered at Reid, where classroom tuition and access to the latest in multimedia  technology, including a 'virtual campus' and computer laboratory, will be offered.

 Tuition will also be available through distance learning and the Home Tutor Scheme, whereby clients study  English 'one on one' in their own homes, with the help of a volunteer tutor.

 'This flexibility of delivery ensures that wherever AMEP clients are and whatever their circumstances and  learning preferences, they will be able to access tuition which is most appropriate to their needs,' Mr  Hardgrave said.

 'ACT AMES' local knowledge and experience, together with the wide consultation it undertakes with AMEP  clients and community networks, will ensure its provision of educational programs tailored to the needs of  ACT residents.

 'I congratulate the Canberra Institute of Technology on winning this, its second contract for AMEP delivery  since the introduction of tendering in 1998, and I look forward to a continued successful partnership which  will best serve the needs of AMEP clients, the community and Australia as a whole.'
