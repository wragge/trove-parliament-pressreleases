 ANNIVERSARY OF BEIJING MASSACRE - HILL CALLS FOR CONTINUED  RESTRAINT, FASTER PROCESSING OF IMMIGRATION APPLICATIONS

 On the anniversary of the Beijing massacre, the Shadow Minister  for Foreign Affairs, Senator Robert Hill warned the Hawke  Government that it should exercise continued restraint in  relations with the People's Republic of China and not revert to a 

 "business as usual" stance.

 "In the year since June 4th 1989, the Chinese Government has  neither shown signs of contrition for its bloody suppression of  pro-democracy demonstrators at Tienanmen Square nor changed its  hard-line attitude towards the legitimate aspirations of the  Chinese people to greater democratic freedoms.

 "Ideally, we would seek to have better relations with China,  recognising that China is a major regional power with strategic,  political and economic significance.

 "Nevertheless, the Chinese Government must show that it is  prepared to observe a standard of human rights befitting China's  position as a senior member of the international community.

 "The international community must also make clear that it will  not tolerate gross human rights abuses.

 Senator Hill also sharply criticised the Hawke Government's  treatment of Chinese students in Australia.

 "Despite the Prime Minister's expressions of sympathy and  support for Chinese students in Australia who have expressed  fears of persecution on return to China, the Hawke Government has  condemned these same students to a year of uncertainly, anxiety  and genuine hardship.

 "Despite their having lodged applications for refugee or  humanitarian status, some as long as a year ago, there is no  indication that the Hawke Government has even started to process  the applications.

 Senator Hill called on the Hawke Government to take immediate  steps to ensure that those Chinese students who have applied to  stay in Australia on refugee or humanitarian grounds have their  applications processed expeditiously and fairly on a case-by-case  basis.
