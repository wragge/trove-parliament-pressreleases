 Immigration Department confirms new laws allow Minister to  make political exemptions  

 

 Senator Nettle, 26th May 2006   

 In response to questioning by Senator Nettle Department of Immigration officials  today confirmed that proposed new laws allow the minister to discriminate politically  by exempting potential refugees from East Timor from being sent to Nauru.    

 "Clearly the intention of the government is to send West Papuans to Nauru but  potential East Timorese refugees could be exempted," Senator Nettle said.    

 "This law is a political fix which puts politics above human rights.    

 "It was very revealing that Department of Immigration officials thought that if  refugees came from East Timor alternative arrangements could be made for them  instead of sending them to Nauru.    

 "This is confirmation that this policy is not about border protection but about political  protection for the government's friends in Jakarta."
