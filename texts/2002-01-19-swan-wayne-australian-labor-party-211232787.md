 WAYNE SWAN MP

 ACTING SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

 MEDIA RELEASE

 MINE CLEARANCE IN AFGHANISTAN: FURTHER AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE REQUIRED

 The Acting Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Wayne Swan, today renewed Labor’s call for the Australian Government to make a significant additional contribution to the urgent task of anti-personnel landmine clearance in Afghanistan.

 “The  wounding  of  a  highly-trained  Australian  Special  Air  Service  soldier  underlines the great danger posed by uncleared landmines in Afghanistan”, Mr Swan said.

 “As a consequence of nearly a quarter of a century of conflict, Afghanistan is one of the three most mined countries in the world.  United Nations agencies estimate that nearly  1,000  sq  km  of  the  country  is  mined,  and  that  334  sq  km  of  this  is  in  key agricultural areas.”

 “According to the UN, up to 300 civilian casualties a month are still occurring through landmine accidents  -- that is, ten every day, including children.  The total number of casualties is probably greater, as fatalities, by definition, do not report themselves.”

 “The  landmine  clearance  problem  is  compounded  by  the  massive  amounts  of unexploded  ordinance  arising  from  the  current  conflict  -  including  unexploded, yellow-coloured cluster bombs which are particularly visually attractive to children.”

 “Mine  clearance  is  an  urgent  priority,  both  because  of  the  need  to  reduce  civilian casualties and to remove a major impediment to the distribution of emergency food aid and the repatriation of 3.1 million refugees back to Afghanistan and the return of more than 1.5 million internally displaced persons within the country.”

 “Mine clearance is a vital part of the efforts to deal with the Afghan refugee crisis.  If roads,  fields  and  villages  are  mined,  people  are  not  going  to  go  return  to  their homes.”

 “Australia has been a modest contributor to the United Nations Mine Action Program in  Afghanistan  for  some  years,  although  this  contribution  was  reduced  to  zero  in 1999.   In  2000,  Australia  contributed  one  tenth  of  the  amount  contributed  by  the Netherlands, a country of comparable economic size to Australia.”

 “It is matter of concern that the Australian Government has still not responded to the urgent recommendation for further support for mine clearance activities made by the Shadow  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Kevin  Rudd,  following  his  visit  to  the Pakistan/Afghanistan  border  a  month  ago.   In  his  report  on  his  visit,  Mr  Rudd recommended that Australia contribute an additional US$2 million to mine clearance efforts in Afghanistan.”

 “The  Howard  Government  should  delay  no  longer  and  make  an  urgent  additional contribution  to  help  reduce  the  terrible  human  toll  of  landmine  casualties  in Afghanistan.”  (An extract from Mr Rudd’s report is attached.)

 AFGHANISTAN TACKLING THE REFUGEE PROBLEM AT SOURCE

 A Report on a Visit to Islamabad and Peshawar by Kevin Rudd MP, Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs 10 December - 15 December 2001

 Extract

 De-mining Afghanistan

 16. De-mining is equally fundamental to the restoration of security in Afghanistan. Afghanistan after 20 years of civil war has become one o f the most mined countries in  the  world.   UN  agencies  and  NGOs  with  whom  I  spoke  in  Islamabad  regard  an acceleration of the de-mining program as fundamental to security for returning IDP’s and refugees; for the delivery of emergency food and the reconstruction of roads and agriculture.  The UNHCR Country Co-ordinator for Afghanistan advised that his office in  certain  cases  has  had  to  advise  internally  displaced  persons  against  returning home because of the mine threat

 17. Prior to the renewal of conflict after September 11, the total contaminated area of Afghanistan had identified was 948 square km.  This included

 â¢ 157 square km’s of agricultural land . â¢ 14 square km’s of residential and commercial land â¢ 3 square km’s of irrigation canals â¢ 32 square km’s of roads â¢ 138 square km’s of grazing land

 18. The  human  and  economic  impact  of  the  landmine  problem  has  been immense.   Quite  apart  from  the  impact  on  agriculture  and  transportation,  non combatant  causalities  are  estimated  to  be  as  high  as  150  -  300  per  month  -  with many  more  believed  to  die  before  receiving  medical  treatment.   I  encountered  a number  of  civilian’s  casualties  of  land  mine  accidents  at  the  Shamshatoo  refugee camp near Peshawar.

 19. In  January  1990  UNOCHA  initiated  the  mine  action  programme  for Afghanistan (MAPA) the year 2001 marks the 12th year of MAP’s mine action work in Afghanistan.   The  current  workforce  of  MAPA  includes  10  expatriates  and  4,800 Afghans.   The  Director  of  MAPA  advised  that  in  the  12  year  history  of  the programme,  there  had  only  been  one  causality  from  among  the  many  de-mining teams working across Afghanistan.

 20. Some  20  supporter  countries  including  Australia  have  contributed  to  this programme  (of  approximately  $20  million  US  per  year)  since  the  early  1990’s. Australia has been a modest but consistent contributor - with the exception of 1999 when it contributed zero.  The pattern of donor country contributions can be found in Attachment F.

 21. Because  of  the  impact  of  post  11  September  hostilities,  the  proliferation  of unexploded  ordinance  (in  particular  yellow  coloured  US  Cluster  Bombs  which  are particularly attractive to children who, attracted to the brightness of the colour are in danger  of  mistaking  unexploded  cluster  bombs  for  similarly  coloured  US  Aid  food

 packages dropped across Afghanistan) in addition to fresh mine laying by retreating Taliban,  the  mission  of  MAPA  has  become  massively compounded.   As  a  result  of this, the UN Co-ordinator for  Humanitarian Affairs has launched an emergency plan for donor states for the period October 2001 - March 2002.  This appeal is for a total of  US  $34  million  for  the  upcoming  3-4  month  period  in  order  to  undertake emergency mine clearance in areas impeding refugee repatriation and the return of internally displaced persons.  Of this amount, as of 13 December, UNOCHA advised that there was still a shortfall of US$15.8 million.

 22. Australia  has  provided  US  $256,000  to  the  general  appeal.   This  does  not appear  to  take  into  account  the  urgent  and  expanded  demands  of  the  mine  action programme.  It also noteworthy that Australia’s contribution stands at less than 10% of  the  Netherlands  -  a  country  of  comparable  economic  size  to  Australia  and arguably a country less effected by refugee outflow from the region than Australia.  It is  also  noteworthy  that  according  to  UNOCHA,  Australia’s  contribution  represents little more than half that of New Zealand.

 23. According  to  the  UN  Co-ordinator  for  Afghanistan,  the  UN  estimate  is  that  it would  need  US  $30  million  per  year  for  12  years  to  clear  the  bulk  of  unexploded landmines  in  Afghanistan.   The  UN could  achieve  this in  3  years  if  donor countries provided US $200 million per year.

 24. Australia  has  a  proud  history  of  involvement  in  engagement  in  de-mining operations  -  most  particularly  in  Cambodia  and,  in  the  early  1990’s  in  Afghanistan itself.  Australian Defence personnel deployed in the Afghanistan de-mining operation have since been employed by the UN to assist with the UN’s global responsibilities in the area of de-mining.  The Programme Co-ordinator for MAPA also advised that a South  Australian  firm  had  produced  the  best  de-mining  device  available  on  the international market.

 Recommendation

 It is recommended that for the upcoming emergency requirements of the period until March 2002, Australia should contribute an additional US$2 million  to  the  emergency  UNOCHA  donor  alert  for  the  Mine  Action Programme  for  Afghanistan.   This  additional  contribution  should  be made immediately and ideally this contribution should be made in cash. The  Programme  Manager  of  the  Mine  Action  Programme  indicated  that some  supplementation  of  an  Australian  contribution  could  be  made  in kind given the considerable expertise that Australia has in the de-mining area.
