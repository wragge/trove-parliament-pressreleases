 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH   

 9 April 2011   

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR,  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW,  NORAH HEAD

 E&OE……………………….………………………………………………………………… 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 It’s great to be here at Norah Head on day eight of Pollie Pedal and it’s good to have been at this community  event with some of my new state Liberal colleagues. The Central Coast was a clean sweep for the Liberal  Party in the state election and, while I know there are some differences between state and federal politics,  obviously this augurs very well for our chances at the next federal poll in this area. 

 Of course, this morning I visited National Ceramic Industries up there in Rutherford and this is a business  which is seriously threatened by the Prime Minister’s proposed carbon tax and the whole point of the carbon  tax is that every single manufacturing business in this country is potentially at risk because there isn’t a  manufacturing business anywhere in this country that doesn’t use energy in large quantities and that energy  is going to get massively more expensive under the Prime Minister’s carbon tax. 

 It was Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard’s predecessor, who said that he did not want to be prime minister of a  country that didn’t make things anymore and it seems that Julia Gillard, Kevin Rudd’s successor, is figuring  to make Australia a country that is no longer manufacturing. We had a number of businesses leaders  yesterday in Canberra slam the carbon tax. We’ve had the head of BlueScope Steel saying repeatedly that  the carbon tax is an act of economic vandalism. If we are serious about maintaining Australia as a  manufacturing country, if we are serious about preserving and extending jobs in this country, if we’re  serious about trying to keep cost of living pressures down we won’t go ahead with this toxic tax. 

 Just one other issue I should comment on. There’s been yet another boat arrive in the last few hours. When  Julia Gillard was the Shadow Minister for Immigration she used to put out press releases saying “another  boat, another policy failure”. Well, in fact, there were very few policy failures under the Howard  Government because in the last five years of the Howard Government there were very few boats. Since the  middle of 2008 there’s been one policy failure after another because there’s just been one boat after another  and the latest boat is the latest policy failure and it just shows that this Government has totally lost control of  Australia’s borders. 

 QUESTION: 

 On the carbon tax you’ve been very specific about the impact it will have. Pensioners, industries you

 mentioned, but how can you be specific when there isn’t a price on carbon? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Because I am using the Treasury’s own figures. The Treasury’s own figures. All of the Treasury modeling  has assumed a price of either $26 a tonne in the case of the Government’s former emissions trading scheme  or $30 a tonne in the case of the proposed carbon tax. So, how can they object to me taking them at their  own word? 

 QUESTION: 

 Do you not think there has to be some pain for the consumers to change their behavior though? Do you  accept that they need to change their behaviour to lower emissions? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 I don’t believe that we need to punish ordinary families in order to protect the environment and there’s no  way we should be punishing families to protect the environment and that’s the whole point of this tax. It  won’t protect the environment but it will punish families. It won’t clean up the environment but it will clean  out your wallet. That’s the whole point of it. It’s just going to make things more expensive, it’s not  necessarily going to reduce pollution. 

 QUESTION: 

 You’re obviously being very strong on your attacks of Gillard’s policy but we’ve asked a few people here  today what your policy is on climate change and nobody’s been able to tell us. Don’t you think that’s a  failure on your part? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Well the Government is in issue here. I mean, this is a Government which is threatening to change the way  everyone lives, threatening to change the way everyone works and we have a clear, straight-forward  alternative on the table. We have a plan for direct action to reduce emissions. We’re going to spend about $1  billion a year from the Budget and we think that as a result of that $1 billion a year we’ll have more trees,  better soil and smarter technology, and through these methods we can achieve the five per cent reduction in  emissions by 2020. 

 QUESTION: 

 Do you think you’re getting that message across though? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Well my job, first and foremost, is to expose the damage that this Government is threatening to do. That’s  my job first and foremost and the fact that more and more people are realising that this is a toxic tax  suggests that at least people are starting to get that message. 

 QUESTION: 

 Just a couple of other issues. Do you support the $20 million campaign by the clubs industry against the  pokie reforms? 

 TONY ABBOTT:

 I think people are entitled to put a viewpoint, and if the clubs want to put a viewpoint they’re entirely at  liberty to do that. I mean, if the ACTU and the unions are entitled to advertise in favour of the Government  why aren’t the clubs of Australia entitled to advertise against the Government? Now, I certainly think that  problem gambling is an issue. We do need to take problem gambling seriously but clubs are part of  Australia’s social fabric and we can’t tackle gambling in ways which damage the social fabric. 

 QUESTION: 

 Obviously, last time they came up against a major industry advertising campaign they folded. Do you expect  to see the same here? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Well, let’s wait and see. 

 QUESTION: 

 Another issue, Kate, the Defence cadet, she’s apparently out on leave now. Is that your understanding? Have  you had any briefing on that? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Look, I know that there are a number of investigations underway and I think we need to let those  investigations take their course but certainly conduct of this type is utterly unacceptable and people who  have been the victims of this type of conduct need to be given every support. 

  QUESTION: 

 Just finally, do you support that her case should be heard at Senate Estimates? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Look, there’d be nothing to stop senators questioning Defence Department officials but I would think that  the best thing now is for these investigations to go ahead and in the meantime for the victim of what’s  obviously been an appalling and outrageous bit of conduct, for her to be given every support. 

 QUESTION: 

 Andrew Wilkie’s threatened to pull his support from the Government if they don’t go ahead with this pokie  tax. Could you work with Andrew Wilkie to form a government? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Look, that’s a matter for Andrew. I mean I have tried to be open and constructive with all the independents,  and what they do is up to them.
