 ONE SMALL STEP FOR THE AID PROGRAM,   ONE GIANT LEAP STILL REQUIRED   

 On  the  face  of  it,  Labor  welcomes  the  modest  improvement  to  the  aid  program   announced in the 2007 Budget.     

 Although the broadcast improvements are not as significant as the Government  would like the aid community to believe, we welcome even a slight improvement  to the lagging Australian aid program.    

 Whilst the Government seems to have heeded Federal Labor’s call for increased  funding in a range of sectors, there are still many shortfalls: 

 â¢ Education - Labor called for an increased focus on primary education, but  in fact the proportion spent on basic education has fallen; 

 â¢ Infrastructure  -  the  increased  spending  on  infrastructure  is  welcome  but   fails  to  address  the  crisis  in  access  to  clean  water,  which  is  the  biggest   cause of child death in the world.    

 Furthermore,  there  is  still  no  focus  on  the  key  task  of  implementing  the   Millennium  Development  Goals  -  global  goals  the  Howard  Government  signed   up to in the year 2000 to reduce poverty by half by the year 2015. Since then, the  Howard Government has made no commitment to achieve these goals.   

 And  what  of  climate  change?  One  of  the  greatest  issues  impacting  our   neighbouring region barely got a mention.    

 Many of our neighbouring states in the South Pacific are already dealing with the  impact  of  climate  change  and  the  emergency  of  climate  change  refugees.  The   Howard Government’s token response is to make a one-off payment this year to  financial institutions such as the World Bank to meet objectives of mitigation and  adaptation. This is grossly under-estimating the response needed, and shows the 

 Howard’s  Government  lack  of  understanding  of  the  very  real  issue  of  climate   change.    

 Another  headline  issue  for  which  there  are  limited  new  funds  is  HIV/AIDs.   HIV/AIDs is one of the largest threats to Papua New Guinea and the Asia Pacific.  This “looming pandemic”, as described by Bill Bowtell (Lowy Institute), is not only  rising at alarming rates, but also “threatens severe financial consequences”.    

 It  has  taken  the  Howard  Government  11  years  to  arrive  at  this  stage  and  even   now, the aid program still lags behind the international donor community. In fact,  there  has  been  no  change  in  the  ratio  of  aid  as  a  per  cent  of  Gross  National   Income  (GNI)  and  only  a  3%  increase  in  real  change  over  the  previous  year.   Australia’s aid contribution has remained stagnant at an embarrassingly low 0.3  per  cent  GNI.  This  is  still  below  the  Labor  Government’s  contribution  to  aid  of   0.32 per cent GNI in 1996, and well below the average country effort of 0.46 per  cent GNI.

 We will continue to examine the details of the aid budget to ensure that the focus  of  Australia’s  aid  remains  the  implementation  of  the  Millennium  Development   Goals and the reduction of global poverty and inequality.    

 Australians  are  generous  people.  They  are  entitled  to  expect  that  their   government will use their money efficiently and effectively on these high priority  challenges.
