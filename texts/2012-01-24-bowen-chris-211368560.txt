 The Hon Chris Bowen MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 Parliament House Canberra ACT 2600 Telephone (02) 6277 7860 Fax (02) 6273 4144 

 

 The Hon Scott Morrison MP  Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  Member for Cook  Parliament House  CANBERRA ACT 2600   

 

 Dear Mr Morrison,   

 I write following our meeting on Friday 23 December 2012 where we discussed the  Government’s written proposal that included the passage of the Government’s  offshore processing legislation.   

 The Government's overall objective is to deal comprehensively with people  smuggling and to minimise the risk of a repeat of recent appalling tragedies  including the loss of life off the Indonesian coast. With that goal in mind, we have  entered into without prejudice discussions with you on a possible solution for the  future.   

 To be clear, as outlined by the Acting Prime Minister in his letter to the Leader of the  Opposition off 22 December, the purpose of these good faith discussions is to secure  agreement to the passage of the Government's offshore processing legislation  without Opposition amendment, so the Government can fully implement the  Malaysian Arrangement as well as seek to establish offshore processing facilities on  Papua New Guinea and Nauru.   

 The clear and consistent expert policy advice provided to the Government is that the  Malaysia Arrangement is the most effective deterrent available because it removes  any certainty of resettlement outcome in Australia. This deterrent cannot be  achieved simply by establishing offshore processing facilities on PNG and/or Nauru.   

 I am writing further in relation to three areas of interest to you and the Deputy  Leader of the Opposition.   

 Temporary visas   

 The Government and Opposition have different views as to the effectiveness of  temporary visas in discouraging irregular arrivals. The clear advice to the  Government has been that following the implementation of Temporary Protection  Visas under the Howard Government, well over 9000 asylum seekers arrived by boat  and that included an increase in the percentage of women and children who made  this dangerous voyage to Australia.   

 2 

 However, as a further sign of good faith, the Government would be prepared to  consider establishing a review into the efficacy of temporary visas in complementing  offshore processing.   

 The Government believes that it is important that any consideration of temporary  visas is evidence based and well considered.   

 We would envisage this review being led by a credible, independent person with  experience of providing advice to Government on complex policy. We would of  course need to mutually agree on the reviewer(s). This review should report to the  Government in a number of stages throughout the course of 2012.   

 The review would need to consider the efficacy of TPVs as a deterrent of Irregular  Maritime Arrivals, how they comply with our international obligations, as well as their  impact on individuals who might be granted them. The review would also need to  assess historical evidence and consider this in the context of the continuing evolution  of people smuggling and the ability of asylum seekers to adapt to known  circumstances. The review should have the opportunity to undertake public  consultation and examine relevant international comparisons. I would envisage that  the review would specifically commission and examine intelligence as to whether  temporary visas are a deterrent or may encourage irregular movement.    

 The Coalition would have the opportunity to receive regular briefings on the progress  of this review.   

 I have enclosed a draft Terms of Reference for your consideration. Again, I would  envisage the final terms of reference being agreed between us.   

 Possible redress in Malaysia   

 You also expressed an interest on what might be done to further strengthen the  Malaysian Arrangement to allow individual asylum seekers who are transferred under  the arrangement to seek a form of redress against certain serious incidents while in  Malaysia. These incidents might include being mistakenly detained as an illegal  immigrant or for working illegally, being exploited by Malaysian employers, or an 

 inability to access those support mechanisms the Arrangement puts in place for  those transferred to Malaysia. As you would be aware, under the Arrangement,  those transferred to Malaysia would have access to basic health and education  services as well as work rights and an initial period in supported, transitional  accommodation before going into the community.   

 The Government is prepared to engage the UNHCR to examine how its role may be  further enhanced with respect to dealing with any such serious incidents. The  Government envisages the UNHCR providing a case management service to  transferees who need assistance and a formal reporting role to the Joint Committee  and to the Advisory Committee that will be set up as a part of the Arrangement.   

 As it stands under the Malaysian Arrangement, those transferred to Malaysia would  be provided with access to the UNHCR hotline. 

 3 

 

 This process could be supplemented as follows:   

 ï· UNHCR could also be provided with a 24 hour contact number for a relevant  officer in the Ministry of Home Affairs;   

 ï· UNHCR could be funded to provide a case management service to the  Transferee to:  o arrange for any medical treatment if necessary;  o arrange for any counselling if necessary; 

 o arrange contact with family and friends;  o make an immediate interim report of the incident to the Joint  Committee;  o provide any follow up reports to the Joint Committee;  o fully document the circumstances of the incident and provide a final 

 report to the Joint Committee and to the Advisory Committee.     

 ï· UNHCR could be provided with a standing invitation to report any incident to  the Joint Committee. The Joint Committee will ask the Ministry of Home  Affairs representative to provide advice to the Committee as to the nature of  the incident and what mitigation strategies might be adopted for the future.   

 ï· The Advisory Committee could be asked to provide an exception report to  respective Ministers as soon as practicable after any incident and a 6 monthly  publicly available report to Ministers as to any incidents in the reporting period  and remedial action taken to prevent further such incidents.   

 The Government would also be prepared to discuss with you the establishment of a  bipartisan parliamentary committee which would receive regular reports on the  welfare of asylum seekers who have been transferred to Malaysia, Papua New  Guinea and Nauru.   

 Establishment of an offshore processing facility on Nauru   

 Given our mutual interest in ensuring that any such agreement that we can come to  is implemented quickly, I think it is prudent that I also provide a short update on the  requirements to stand-up an offshore processing facility on Nauru.   

 Initial site inspections will be undertaken on 3 January 2012 to survey the state of  the former facilities on Nauru in particular to determine the presence of any  hazardous materials and assess the state of the building infrastructure.  The initial  assessment will provide a better indication of the extent of replacement and repairs  to be done and, thus, time required to stand up the facilities.     

 The main considerations that influence the time it will take to stand up suitable  facilities on Nauru include the state of the building/site, the Australian Government’s  ability to be able to engage contractors to provide detention and health services at  the site, and the quality of the utilities infrastructure. For example, the current  advice is that the state of public utilities in Nauru is poor with electricity routinely

 unavailable for around half of each day.   

 I am more than happy to elaborate on all of these items at the meeting we have  scheduled for later today.   

 I believe that this letter, following the Government’s written proposal, and your  response, should be the subject of a further meeting after you have had the  opportunity to consider it further and consult colleagues. I would propose a further 

 meeting between us early in the week commencing Monday 9 January 2012.   

 The Government is treating this letter as confidential as are our discussions while  they are continuing.   

 Yours sincerely   

 

 CHRIS BOWEN   

 

 

 

 Review into the effectiveness and efficacy of   Temporary Protection Visas and   Temporary Humanitarian Visas 

 

 Terms of Reference 

 

 Objectives and Scope of the Review 

 

 The overarching objective of this review is to inform the Government’s  consideration of policy options to combat people smuggling and discourage  people from making dangerous voyages by sea to seek protection in  Australia.     

 The Government is seeking to undertake a comprehensive independent  review of the TPV and the associated THV regime. The review will examine  the efficacy of temporary protection as policy to discourage irregular  movement to Australia by sea, and ways of managing any potential negative  impacts of such a regime.    

 

 The review will: 

 1. Assess the effectiveness on TPV/THV on combating people smuggling  and discouraging Irregular Maritime Arrivals (IMAs), including the  effectiveness of the past restrictions such as those on travel and family  sponsorship. 

 2. Assess the impact on the mental health on clients holding TPV/THVs.  

 3. Assess the impact of TPV and THV entitlement arrangements on the  Government and non-Government sectors (i.e. potential burden shift). 

 4. Examine and provide advice on the use and effectiveness of temporary  protection internationally. 

 5. Consider entitlements attached to TPV/THVs, including access to  settlement and integration pathways, and make recommendations.  

 6. Examine and determine whether the TPV and THV and related  entitlements, comply with Australia’s obligations under the:  

 a. 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees  

 b. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 

 c. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or  Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), and 

 d. Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC). 

 This should include assessment against previous entitlements and, any  recommendations regarding entitlements. 

 7. Consider how the reintroduction of a TPV/THV regime would impact on  the delivery and composition of the humanitarian program. 

 8. Consult the non-government sector and provide advice on past  experience and possible impacts of the re-introduction of TPV/THV. 

 9. Analysis of the previous caseload of TPV/THVs holders including: 

 a. demographics of the caseload 

 b. eventual (visa) outcomes for TPV/THV holders. 

 10. Any advice on mitigating any risks and issues tat may arise should the  Government seek to re-introduce a TPV/THV regime. 

 

 Structure and timing  The review will be conducted in three stages:   

 Stage 1:  Initial discussion paper due to Government - 30 June 2012  This discussion paper will provide an initial recommendation to  proceed with TPV/ THV prior to further consultation.   

 Stage 2:   Consultation with advocacy groups - July/August 2012.   

 Stage 3:   Final report due to Government - 1 December 2012. 

 

 Composition and Consultation  The review panel will be chaired by xxxx.     The review will be supported by xxx and xxxx   

 The review chair may, where necessary draw on expertise of the Department  of Immigration and Citizenship.   

 Consultation with advocacy groups, community stakeholders and other  government agencies will occur at Stage 2 (see above).  This consultation  stage will commence only upon recommendation to proceed by the chair of  the panel in the Stage 1 discussion paper, and subsequent endorsement by  the Government.   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, and Shadow Minister for  Immigration and Citizenship will be consulted at each Stage of the review.

 Dear Minister,   

 Thank you for your letter of 30 December, 2011 and our discussion on that day.   

 I am pleased the Government has commenced the process of reopening the offshore processing centre on Nauru  and that Department officials visited Nauru earlier this week for this purpose.   

 The Government and Parliament of Nauru are highly supportive and cooperative and the conditions on Nauru are a  significant improvement on those confronted by the Coalition when we opened the centre more than a decade ago.   

 I am sure that if the Government has sufficient resolve in implementing this proposal it will be able to overcome any  obstacles that may be identified in your reconnaissance.    

 In addition we assume the Government will be similarly moving to reopen the facility at Manus Island and welcome  your advice that this facility could also be run as an open centre, as would be the case on Nauru.    

 Your proposal raises a number of matters that I intend to raise with my Shadow Cabinet colleagues before giving you  a more definitive response. To this end I propose that we next meet on Wednesday, January 18, 2012 at 1.00pm in  Canberra to enable these discussions to take place. As with our previous arrangements we expect Hon Kevin Rudd  and Hon Julie Bishop to attend this meeting, given the significant foreign affairs issues involved.   

 Please contact Ann Duffield on 0409 842 069 if your office has any questions on these proposed arrangements.   

 Regards

 Dear Mr Morrison,   

 Thank you for your letter dated 6 January 2012.   

 In your letter you make reference to the recent visit by Australian Government officials to  Nauru. This is a clear demonstration of the Government’s commitment to pursuing  expeditiously the offshore processing of asylum seekers, once the Opposition has given a  clear undertaking to support the Government’s proposal, as previously outlined in writing to  the Opposition.   

 You will be aware that the clear advice to the Government is that the most effective  deterrent of irregular migration to Australia is the Malaysian Arrangement; any additional  offshore processing centre(s) would be a complement to this Arrangement.   

 In addition, without the passage of the Government’s offshore processing legislation there is  no solid legal basis on which to fully implement the Malaysian Arrangement or establish an  offshore processing facility on Nauru.   

 I appreciate you taking the time to consult with the Leader of the Opposition and your  Shadow Cabinet colleagues before responding to the Government.   

 I would be happy to meet with you and Ms Bishop on January 18, as you suggest. Prior  commitments would not allow Minister Rudd to join us at this meeting.  If you would like to  discuss meeting arrangements further, I would be happy to do so.   

 I look forward to meeting with you regarding the Opposition’s response, and hopefully, to  discuss how the Government can implement the commitments that form its written proposal  on offshore processing.   

 As was the case with my previous letter, the Government is treating this correspondence and  our discussions as confidential, while they continue.   

 Yours sincerely 

 

 CHRIS BOWEN

 By facsimile: (02) 9091 7911; (02) 6273 4144 

 

 Dear Minister, 

 The Coalition entered these discussions to identify to the Government the measures the Coalition  would support.   

 The Coalition is under no obligation to support further policy failures and experiments from this  Government, when proven measures are available. We will certainly not support policies that run  contrary to the principles we have held on this issue for a decade, as a condition for the Government  to embrace the Coalition’s proven measures.  

 This is a problem of the Government’s own creation, caused by your Government’s own repeated  policy failures which, even now, your Government continues to deny.  It is for the Government to  govern and take action on the measures available to them. 

 If the Government believes our policies should be restored then it should do so and it will have our  support.  If the Government insists on policies not supported by the Coalition, it must seek support  from its alliance partners, the Greens, and the Independents.  

 As noted in my letter of January 6, the following is the Coalition’s further response to your letter of  December 30, 2011.  

 Malaysian People swap 

 We have made our objections to the Malaysian people swap clear from the outset. Your response  indicates you are unable to address the problems we have consistently highlighted.  As a result, our  position is unchanged. 

 I do not share the Government's confidence in the UNHCR's ability to provide the protections for  people sent to Malaysia that is necessary. They need the protection of the law, not committees and  hotlines.   

 2 

 

 Unlike on Nauru, people sent to Malaysia will be living unprotected in the community where they  will be exposed to significant abuse. It is already unsatisfactory that, unlike on Nauru or Manus  Island, children sent to Malaysia will not have access to proper schools and that medical care is  almost nonexistent. It is unacceptable that they also be denied legal protections in these  circumstances.  

 I note the Government does not believe it can obtain such legal protections from the Malaysian  Government. I also note that the Government does not believe an open ended arrangement with  Malaysia is either necessary or achievable.  

 In our view, the Malaysian people swap remains a bad deal for Australia and a cruel deal for people  sent to Malaysia. The Coalition cannot and will not support the Malaysian people swap as proposed  by the Government.   

 Offshore Processing Bill  

 The Coalition supports offshore processing in countries where there are also offshore protections for  people sent there. The Government’s Offshore Processing Bill abolishes human rights protections in  the Migration Act for offshore processing and that the High Court found to be lacking in the  Government’s proposed Malaysia people swap. 

 The Government’s Bill seeks to provide a blank cheque for itself on human rights issues and to  unilaterally approve its Malaysian people swap - we consider both measures unnecessary and  inappropriate for any Government. 

 The Coalition's amendment seeks to retain human rights protections for offshore processing by  requiring an offshore processing country to be a signatory to the Refugee Convention or Protocol.  This was the position advocated by the Prime Minister before the last election and the reason cited  by the Prime Minster for previously not supporting the reopening of the offshore processing centre  on Nauru. 

 The Government has rejected the Coalition’s amendment and not provided any alternative  amendments that address the concerns we have raised.  In the absence of the Government  proposing further amendments that would address our concerns, the Coalition cannot support the  Government’s Bill as proposed. 

 Temporary Protection Visas (TPVs) 

 The Government has the support of the Coalition to restore TPVs immediately for all offshore entry  persons, without delay. 

 The Government’s proposal for an inquiry lasting up to 12 months creates further delay and  demonstrates again that the Government remains in denial about the impact of its decision to  abolish the proven measures of the Coalition that have resulted in more than 14,800 people arriving  illegally on 275 boats since your Government abolished TPVs and the Pacific Solution.   

 Nauru and Manus Island Offshore Processing Centres  

 The Government should reopen the offshore processing facilities at Nauru and at Manus Island and  the Coalition will support the passage of the Off Shore Processing Bill with our proposed  amendment, to provide the legal certainty the Government seeks. 

 3 

 

 The Coalition has never said that reopening these facilities in isolation will solve the issue, but it is a  far better and stronger response than the Greens’ policy of releasing asylum seekers into the  community with work rights and income support, that the Government has now adopted.  

 Regional cooperation 

 As discussed at our first meeting the Coalition is open to requests for support on matters regarding  our relationship with Indonesia and our regional and other neighbours to ensure greater border  control.  This may include providing greater support for intelligence gathering and interception  resources, improving the technology and management of border control systems and to generally  improve enforcement capabilities within our region.  We would also welcome a further update from  the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his recent visit to Indonesia where these matters were discussed.  

 If the Government wishes to provide further information, raise any further points on these or  related matters or seek clarification of the Coalition’s view we would be pleased to hold further  discussions.  As on the first occasion, these discussions must also involve the Minister for Foreign  Affairs and the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. 

 I note from your office that Mr Rudd is not available for a meeting for several weeks, however, that a  teleconference could be arranged. We would be available for a teleconference meeting next week. 

 I would be grateful if you could advise us by the close of business on Monday, if you would like to  hold further discussions, so appropriate arrangements can be made.    

 

 Regards 

 

 

 Scott Morrison MP  Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship

 The Hon. Chris Bowen MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  Parliament House  Canberra ACT 2600 

 Dear Minister 

 The Government has sought the Coalition’s support for the Malaysian people swap and the abolition  of human rights protections for offshore processing in the Migration Act. 

 Once again your response has failed to address the serious policy concerns the Coalition has  consistently raised on these matters.  

 The Government has demonstrated once again that it remains in denial about its border protection  failures that have caused the crisis on our borders.   

 Your response indicates that the Government has no intention of seriously addressing the Coalition’s legitimate  policy concerns.  Your response can only be interpreted as an act to intentionally frustrate and therefore  terminate these discussions or disingenuously seek to prolong them. 

 The Coalition will continue to support restoring the policies we successfully implemented in  Government, that remain unchanged and were abolished by the Rudd and Gillard Governments.   

 If the Government insists on support for its Migration Amendment (Offshore Processing and Other  Measures) Bill, it should now hold discussions with its alliance partners the Greens, and the  Independents.  If this is a critical matter for the Government, it should treat the Bill as a matter of  confidence.  

 Yours sincerely 

 

 Scott Morrison  Federal Member for Cook  Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship
