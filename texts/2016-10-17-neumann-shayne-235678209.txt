 SHAYNE NEUMANN MP 

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR    

 DEPARTMENT IN THE DARK ON CENTRAL AMERICAN REFUGEES    

 Despite admitting to leading negotiations with the United States and claiming to be  “very involved,” Immigration Minister Peter Dutton’s senior department advisers  could not recall basic details of the negotiations and agreement between the  Australian Government and United States of America to accept Central American  refugees.     

 The Deputy Secretary testified that she “can’t remember” who initiated the Central  America agreement but later changed her testimony saying “I also think that it was  our idea, from our department, for this arrangement with the United States.”      

 Senior department officials couldn’t confirm when they briefed Immigration Minister  Peter Dutton about options leading into Obama’s Summit of Refugees.    

 The Summit was described as a ‘pay-to-play’ event which saw the Australian  Government commit to accept refugees from Costa Rica in order to get a seat at the  table with President Obama.    

 The Department was unable to answer basic questions:  ï· What was the Department’s role in the development of the refugee deal?  ï· When did you start to negotiate this agreement?  ï· Who initiated the refugee deal?  ï· When did you start the conversation with the Department of Prime Minister 

 and Cabinet about the deal?  ï· Does the deal commence immediately?  ï· How long does the deal run for?  ï· When will refugees start arriving in Australia?  ï· How many refugees are part of the deal?  ï· When did the Department brief the Minister about the deal?  ï· What was the date the Australian Government agreed to increase its intake 

 from Central America?     

 The Prime Minister and the Immigration Minister now have serious questions to  answer about the Central American agreement.
