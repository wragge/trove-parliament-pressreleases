 MEDIA RELEASE

 Minister needs to come clean on boat arrival    

 The Australian Greens are calling on the Immigration Minister to come clean about whether an asylum  boat has been seen and intercepted off the coast of Western Australia.     

 “We have seen reports today that indicate a boat has been found close to the coast of Australia, and in  response, Minister Dutton has refused to confirm or deny if it exists,” Greens Immigration Spokesperson  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said today.    

 “Minister Dutton needs to stop keeping the Australian public in the dark and tell us exactly what is going  on.     

 “The secrecy and arrogance displayed by this Government are so extreme that it’s nearly farcical: either  there is a boat or there is not. This isn’t a matter of national security, this is about ensuring that  vulnerable people are not mistreated under a veil of secrecy.     

 “If a boat has been found the Government should tell us who is on board, if there are women and  children, and what they intended to do with these people.    

 “This Government has proven that they cannot be trusted to look after the safety of refugees or be  straight with the Australian people about what they are doing with asylum seeker boats intercepted at  sea.”
