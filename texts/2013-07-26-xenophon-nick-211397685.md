 Fresh move to outlaw taxpayer-funded political ads     

 ADS NAUSEUM â¢ a political party and ministers would be personally liable for refunding four times the cost of an unlawful ad campaign  â¢ new Bill based on ALP Bills from 2000 and 2001  Independent  Senator  for  South  Australia,  Nick  Xenophon,  will  introduce  legislation  immediately following the election to outlaw the sort of taxpayer-funded advertising campaign just used for asylum seekers.  Under the proposed legislation—modelled on Bills introduced by then-Opposition Leader Kim Beazley in 2000 and 2001, and Senator Xenophon’s 2011 Bill—heavy penalties will apply for unauthorised ad campaigns.  The  new Bill  will  prohibit  ad  campaigns  for  legislation  that has not yet  been  passed  by the  Parliament, as well as advertising material that is party-political in nature.   “John Howard was a master of this kind of blatant use of taxpayers’ money, and it seems that Kevin Rudd is a worthy successor,” Nick said.  Senator  Xenophon  was  especially  critical  of  the  Government’s  recent  television  advertising  campaign that featured Prime Minister Rudd.   “The  fact  is,  when  you  see  a  politician’s  face  in  a  taxpayer-funded  TV  ad,  you  know  it’s  a  cheap way of doing the party’s ads.”  Under the proposed legislation, Ministers could be personally liable for any unauthorised ads at four times their cost.  “There’s nothing like a multi-million dollar hit to a Minister’s own hip-pocket nerve to focus his or her mind,” Nick said.  Senator  Xenophon  lamented  that  the  highly-principled  position  Kim  Beazley  took  as  ALP  leader hasn’t been followed by Kevin Rudd.   “Kim  Beazley  got  it  right  with  the  legislation  he  introduced  in  2000  and  2001.  I’m  looking  forward to  the  ALP  supporting  legislation  based  on  a  Bill  introduced  by  one  of  its  most  respected recent leaders,” Nick said. “But I won’t be holding my breath.”   For a link to the Senate Committee Report into Nick’s 2011 Bill go to:  http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate_Committees?url=fapa_ctte/completed_inquiries/2010-13/govt_advert_accountability_leg/report/index.htm
