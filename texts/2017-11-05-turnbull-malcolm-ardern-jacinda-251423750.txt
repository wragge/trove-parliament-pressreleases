 Thank you, thank you very much.

I want to just finally conclude these introductory remarks by just making the point that  I made  with Jacinda earlier in the bilateral; you know, Australia is a much bigger economy than New  Zealnd and a much bigger country of course, but we have so much to learn from New Zealand.  

  Many of you have heard me say this before, but there are so many areas where New Zealanders, for  whatever reason *t  John Key *µ*Ãª******Ã¶*}**Ãª***«**]*Ã¶**¡***Ãª**********µ*Ãª***E***¡******o***v******]***v*[*Ã¶**Z***¿******Ãª**u*µ***Z**u*}*v***«**Ã¶*}* *Ã¶*Z*Ã¥*}*¡****Ã¥*}*µ*v******Ãª**¡******}*U**v*}*Ã¶**Ã¶*Z***Ã¶**¡****Z***¿****u*µ***Z**Ã¶*}**Ã¢*o***«**¡*]*Ã¶*Z*U**Ã¶*Z***Ã¶*[*Ãª**(*}*Ã¥**Ãª*µ*Ã¥****t  but New Zealanders do a  lot of things very, very efficiently. Very efficiently in terms of public administration and the way they  approach a lot of their administrative issues and policy issues. So I have always been an Australian  politician and an Australian Prime Minister that looks across to New Zealand as an example of good  government, good administration and r*****o**]*v*v*}*¿***Ã¶*]*}*v*X*/*[*u**Ãª*µ*Ã¥****Ã¶*Z***Ã¶**¡***[*o*o****}*v*Ã¶*]*v*µ****Ã¶*}**o*****Ã¥*v**(*Ã¥*}*u********Z* other and work together under your leadership. So, welcome.  

  PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND:  

  Thank you Prime Minister and can I say what a pleasure it is to be here, to have been hosted at Kirribilli.  I placed a special emphasis, quite deliberately on making my first visit as Prime Minister to Australia. I  think it speaks to the strength of our relationship that within such a tight timeframe, we were able to  make that visit happen because I believe that both of us prioritised that. So Malcolm, I thank you for  that. The fact, of course, that this visit has been preceded by several conversations on the phone, I think,  already laying the foundation for what I know will be a strong and genuine relationship.  

  It was also a priority for me to make sure that I had that opportunity to strengthen that relationship face  *Ã¶*}**(************(*}*Ã¥****W***U******(*}*Ã¥****Ã¶*Z****Ãª*µ*u*u*]*Ã¶**¡***[*Ã¥******}*Ã¶*Z**Z*******]*v*P**Ã¶*}*X*d*}**u***l****Ãª*µ*Ã¥****Ã¶*Z***Ã¶**Ãª*}*u****}*(**Ã¶*Z*}*Ãª*** conversations that we want to prioritise were being had face to face, particularly when it comes to  issues like the TPP, like our shared interest as trading nations and furthering both of our own nations'  causes in that regard.

Of course, that relationship goes beyond people. It speaks to investment, it speaks  to trade, those are areas I hope to see us strengthen, particularly when we have our meeting in March  where we will be looking for additional opportunities to again strengthen the ability for us to work  together more closely and creating an even closer economy for the two of us than we already have. 

  Some of the issues that we have discussed today have been challenging, but I appreciate that as close  *(*Ã¥*]***v***Ãª****v******o*o*]***Ãª*U**¡***[*¿**********v******o****Ã¶*}****]*Ãª***µ*Ãª*Ãª**Ã¶*Z***u**(*Ã¥***v*l*o*«****v****(*µ*o*o*«*X*/****Ã¢*Ã¢*Ã¥*****]***Ã¶****Ã¶*Z***Ã¶*X*

  Is the treatment of the men and women on Manus and Nauru, do you believe that is morally justifiable?  

  As a follow up, Mr Turnbull, what was your response to any offer from Ms Ardern and if you refused it,  what was your rationale?  

  PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND: 

  So, was that one question?  

  [Laughter] 

  PRIME MINISTER: 

  I think there were some supplementaries there, yeah. 

  JOURNALIST:  

  That is one question. That is one question.  

  PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND: 

  Yes, I did renew again New Zealand's offer to take 150 refugees from both Manus Island and Nauru.  New Zealand holds an obligation generally, to make sure that we maintain our obligations to the United  Nations to take refugees. We have set ourselves a quota that we extended to 1000 over the course of  the next year. So that was the offer under which that was made and we firmly keep that on the table. It  is a very genuine offer.  

  As I've said in New Zealand, we of course do not have the circumstances that Australia operating under,  but we can also cannot ignore the human face of what Australia is dealing with as well. The offer is very  genuine and absolutely remains on the table. 

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  Well thank you very much and I want to thank Jacinda for renewing, or reconfirming the offer which was  originally made by her predecessor John Key to Julia Gillard, quite some years ago.  

  Can I just make a few observations though about the situation with people smuggling and refugees in  general. After the Labor government came into power in Australia in 200*Ã*U*:*}*Z*v*,*}*¡***Ã¥***[*Ãª**Ãª*Ã¶*Ã¥*}*v*P****}*Ã¥*****Ã¥* protection policies were altered. As a result, we saw over 50,000 unlawful arrivals and 1200 deaths at  sea.  

  Australia's immigration policy had been outsourced to people smugglers, the worst of the worst  criminals. There were 8,000 children in detention at one point, it was a catastrophe.  

  Rudd, as you know, was replaced by Julia Gillard and then came back briefly before an election and it  was during that period that he recognised the failure of his changes to border protection policy and  asylum seekers who had been intercepted were taken to Nauru and Manus. 

  Since then, the boats have stopped. There has not been a successful people smuggling operation  directed at Australia for well over a thousand days. There no children in detention. That has been a  great achievement.  

  Many of those people smugglers were trying to get people to New Zealand. New Zealand obviously  benefits from the strong border protection policies that we have. We appreciate, as I said, the offer that  has been made and restated today. Now what we are seeking to do is to ensure that there are  opportunities for resettlement for the people on Manus Island and Nauru. As you know, we have an  arrangement with the United States whereby a substantial number, 1250, can, subject to the United  States rigorous vetting, be resettled in the United States. We are pursuing those arrangements at the  moment and that is our commitment. So we want to pursue those, conclude those arrangements and  then in the wake of that, obviously we can consider other ones. The priority right now is the US  arrangement.  

  I want to emphasise that we know what the alternative looks like. Tens of thousands of unlawful arrivals  and over 1,000 men, women and children drowning at sea. We have put the people smugglers out of  business and we will keep them out of business.  

  JOURNALIST:  

  Ms Ardern, would you consider making this offer directly to Papua New Guinea, keeping Australia out of  the loop?  

  PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND:

Of course that agreement will lead to a substantial number of those who have refugee  *Ãª*Ã¶***Ã¶*µ*Ãª*U******]*v*P**Ã¥***Ãª***Ã¶*Ã¶*o*****X*^*}**]*Ã¶*[*Ãª**µ*v*****Ã¥*Ãª*Ã¶***v*******o****Ã¶*Z***Ã¶**Ã¢*Ã¥*]*}*Ã¥*]*Ã¶*«**Z***Ãª********v**Ã¢*o**********}*v**Ã¶*Z***Ã¶**}*(*(***Ã¥*X*K*(****}*µ*Ã¥*Ãª***U* *(*Ã¥*}*u*E***¡******o***v***[*Ãª**Ã¢***Ã¥*Ãª*Ã¢*****Ã¶*]*¿***U**¡****¡***v*Ã¶**}*µ*Ã¥**}*(*(***Ã¥**Ã¶*}**Ã¥***u***]*v**}*v**Ã¶*Z****Ã¶*****o***U**}*(****}*µ*Ã¥*Ãª***U**Ãª*}* we can assist as  much as we are able at expediting a resolution on this issue. 

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  Can I just add that in the last year, Australia has taken through its humanitarian programme over 20,000  refugees to Australia. We have one of the largest rates of refugee acceptance through UN programs on a  per capita basis, of any country in the world. So Australia is a very generous nation when it comes to  refugees.  

  But I stress, we determine which refugees come to Australia. We will not have our immigration program,  *}*µ*Ã¥**Ãª*}*¿***Ã¥***]*P*v*Ã¶*«*U**}*µ*Ã¥****}*Ã¥*****Ã¥*Ãª*U**}*µ*Ã¶*Ãª*}*µ*Ã¥********Ã¶*}**Ã¢***}*Ã¢*o****Ãª*u*µ*P*P*o***Ã¥*Ãª*X*d*Z***Ã¶*[*Ãª**Ã¶*Z****Ã¢*}*]*v*Ã¶*U**Ã¶*Z***Ã¶*[*Ãª**Ã¶*Z****¡*Z*«**¡****Z***¿*** been able to stop the boats, keep the people smugglers out of business, stop women and children  drowning at sea.  

  JOURNALIST:  

  [Inaudible] from Fairfax in New Zealand, can I just clarify here, is the offer still on the table? Because  *«*}*µ*[*Ã¥****v*}*Ã¶**Ã¥***i*****Ã¶*]*v*P**]*Ã¶**}*µ*Ã¶*Ã¥*]*P*Z*Ã¶*X*D*Ãª***Ã¥*****Ã¥*v*U**(*µ*Ã¥*Ã¶*Z***Ã¥**Ã¶*}**Ã¶*Z***Ã¶*U****Ã¥****Ã¶*Z***Ã¥****Ãª*Ã¶*]*o*o****}*v*****Ã¥*v*Ãª**Ã¶*Z*}*µ*P*Z**Ã*]*v***µ***]***o***Ã* main concerns about that offer was that reciprocal travel agreement made between New Zealand and  Australia, that it would become a backdoor way into Australia for some of those refugees? And is there a  way of accepting that offer without triggering a backdoor entry into Australia? 

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  Well if that is addressed to me, I think the offer has been restated and we thank New Zealand for  *u***l*]*v*P**Ã¶*Z***Ã¶**}*(*(***Ã¥*X*t***[*Ã¥****v*}*Ã¶**Ã¶***l*]*v*P**]*Ã¶**µ*Ã¢****Ã¶**Ã¶*Z*]*Ãª**Ã¶*]*u***U**********µ*Ãª****}*(**Ã¶*Z****Ã¥*****Ãª*}*v*Ãª*/****â*Ã¢*o***]*v**********Ã¥*o*]***Ã¥*X  

  OK? I think the next one was Jonathan Lea from Ten News.  

  JOURNALIST:  

  Thank you. Prime Minister Ardern firstly welcome and congratulations. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop  said during your campaign, in her words were that she would find it very hard to build trust with those  involved with allegations designed to undermine the Government of Australia. Were those comments  raised today in your meeting with Prime Minister Turnbull and how would you characterise potentially  any damage done by those comments?

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  Yeah, I agree. We get on very well. We trust each other totally. New Zealand and Australia are as close  as can be and we always will be. The fact that we are from different political traditions is irrelevant, John  Howard and Helen Clarke worked very, very closely together.  

  Australian and New Zealand prime ministers have always walked closely together.

  years before she moved to the United States. So, we were having a chat about my childhood memories  of Mount Pirongia and clambering over Maori Paths and eating a very large quantity of feijoas. So I think  I reduced the New Zealand feijoa population quite materially in my visit.

  We are proud that now we have five Indigenous Australians who are Members of the House and the  Senate. In the House of course, you have the first Indigenous woman to be elected to the House Linda  Burney and on our side, Ken Wyatt, the first Indigenous man to be elected to the House. Indeed, the  first Indigenous Australian to be Minister of a Federal Australian Government, appointed by me. Of  course, we have our Senators, Malarndirri McCarthy, Pat Dodson and Jacqui Lambie as well.  

  Those are all Indigenous voices in our Parliament.  

  As you know we have a commitment to empowered communities, seeking stronger Aboriginal voices  throughout our community. What the Referendum Council recommended, is that there should be a  national, elected representative assembly of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, which would be, it  was said, an advisory group to the Federal Parliament and it would be entrenched in the constitution.  

  Now, the reality is and no detail was provided as to how these should be chosen, or how it should be  elected or anything. That was literally a general proposition.

Of course, we want to see more Indigenous Australians elected to the House and the Senate.  

  But to have a national representative assembly, which is what we are talking about here, which would  be in the Constitution and to which only Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders could be elected, this is  ***}*v*Ã¶*Ã¥***Ã¥*«**Ã¶*}**Ã¶*Z****Ã¢*Ã¥*]*v***]*Ã¢*o***Ãª**}*(****Ã£*µ***o*]*Ã¶*«**}*(****]*Ã¶*]*Ã***v*Ãª*Z*]*Ã¢**]*v***µ*Ãª*Ã¶*Ã¥***o*]***X*/*Ã¶*[*Ãª****}*v*Ã¶*Ã¥***Ã¥*«**Ã¶*}**Ã¶*Z***Ã¶****v****]*Ã¶**¡*}*µ*o*** inevitably seen as a third chamber. Now I know that is contested. But it would inevitably be seen as a  third chamber of Parliament. Moreover it would have, in our judgement, no prospect at all of being  successful in a referendum.  

  So, we believe it is important to focus on, to deliver recognition, to focus on things that are achievable.  The Referendum Council's recommendation of this, a national representative assembly, elected  assembly, I wouldn't say it came completely out of left field, but it was not consistent with all of the  work that had been done on the recognition agenda previously.

Our First Australians joining all the other Australians in the  Parliament on the basis of the equal rights of Australian citizens.

New Zealand is  unique in the fact that we have, applicable to us, several Maori-distinct seats that overlay our  electorates. In part, that has certainly made a significant difference to representation in New Zealand  Parliament.  

  But as have different individual political parties focused on representation in our Parliament. So I am  proud that a quarter of our Caucus are now made up of Maori representatives. Fantastic representatives  who will absolutely serve our party and New Zealand well.  

  When it comes to your question more generally about the citizenship issue, I would contend that that  actually has absolutely nothing to do with New Zealand and nor has it had ever had anything to do with  New Zealand.

  PRIME MINISTER:  

  Well, I'll leave that to my New Zealand counterpart, to answer.  

  PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND:  

  Obviously we continue to advocate strongly around ISDS causes, something I made very clear  domestically and something I think the population would want us to pursue, to ensure we are protecting  New Zealand's domestic best interests.

  PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND:  

  Can I just add on that, obviously we have discussed a side letter between New Zealand and Australia on  ISDS clauses which is something that we see as being mutually beneficial. So that acknowledges of  course, our positioning on ISDS, at least between each other, but as they say, New Zealand will continue  to pursue that going into APEC as well. I don't want to pre-determine the outcome.
