 Federal Member for Eden-Monaro, Gary Nairn, today congratulated the Migrant Resource  Centre of Canberra and Queanbeyan Inc on being awarded ongoing funding of $290,598.

 The Federal Government has reinforced its long-standing commitment to the settlement of  migrants, refugees and humanitarian entrants, by announcing over $8.2 million dollars in  funding in 2003-04 for Migrant Resource Centres (MRC’s) and Migrant Service Agencies  (MSA’s).

 Mr Nairn said Queanbeyan Multilingual Centre will be allocated a portion of the $290,598 grant.

 “The Queanbeyan Multilingual Centre and Migrant Resource Centre of Canberra and  Queanbeyan Inc conducts important work on behalf of the Federal Government to assist newly  arrived migrants, refugees and humanitarian entrants adjust to life in Australia,” Mr Nairn said.

 “Funding is based on settlement need, high standards of performance, and the best value for  taxpayer’s money.

 “The settlement services provided by the Federal Government through Queanbeyan Multilingual  Centre and Migrant Resource Centre of Canberra and Queanbeyan Inc are a worthy investment  in newly arrived migrants to ensure their successful future.

 “These services help to ensure they can participate in our local community equitably and  effectively as quickly as possible.

 “Queanbeyan Multilingual Centre and Migrant Resource Centre of Canberra and Queanbeyan  Inc both play a vital role in Queanbeyan and surrounds to ensure we have a strong and  harmonious community and I look forward to working with them in the coming year,” Mr Nairn  said.
