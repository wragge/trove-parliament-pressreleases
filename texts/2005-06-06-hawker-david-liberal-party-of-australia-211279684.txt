 FUNDING BOOST FOR SUDANESE COMMUNITY   

 Community Connections has been granted $69,000 to help the region’s most recent migrants and refugees  settle in Warrnambool, Member for Wannon, David Hawker, announced today.   

 Community  Connections  provides  a  range  of  services  to  South  West  Victoria,  and  has  been  assisting  the   Sudanese community in Warrnambool with resettlement into the local community.   

 Community Connection’s Bruce Du Vergier said that Community Connections and other agencies have had  to adapt their services in order to maximise the quality of their assistance to the Sudanese community.   

 “This  grant  will  enable  us  to  adapt  our  services  to  help  respond  positively  and  supportively  to  challenges   facing the Sudanese community’s resettlement,” he said.   

 Mr  Hawker  said  that  the  funds  will  assist  Community  Connections  in  providing  culturally  and  linguistically   appropriate information and resources to the Sudanese community in South West Victoria.   

 “The majority of the 13,000 humanitarian arrivals in Australia have a limited knowledge of western culture,  and speak very little English,” he said.   

 “Community  Connections  plays  an  essential  role  in  helping  the  Sudanese  community  develop  a  sense  of   belonging in their new community, while providing them with every opportunity to realise their ambitions for  themselves and their families. 

 

 “Organisations such as Community Connections assist the Sudanese to find accommodation, employment  and provide English language training and health care,” Mr Hawker said.   

 Australia  is  internationally recognised  as  a world leader  in  settlement  services  with dedicated  resettlement   programs delivered by organisations such as Community Connections to help our recent arrivals settle into  their new home.   

 A  full  list  of  grant  recipients  and  general  information  about  the  new  grant  is  available  at
