 VANSTONE FAILS TO ADDRESS REAL ISSUE   

 “The Minister and her Department are avoiding the real issue at the core of the cases  where children are being seized at school”, Labor Shadow Minister Laurie Ferguson  stated.   

 “We are not interested in what percentage of women and children are detained as  stipulated in the Departments statement yesterday. The Dept would appear to be anything  but sensitive to school children issues. The real issue is not whether 7 or 2 children were  detained - it is the fact that DIMIA has committed serious inept acts.”    

 “Further, the Minister’s arguments yesterday that seizing kids at school and reuniting  them with their parents in detention to avoid their return to an ‘empty’ home are  preposterous.”   

 “These episodic adventures by the Department to heroically enter schools and collect  children because their parents have overstayed their visas are nothing but signs that the  Government is impervious to the effects on the children and challenges common 

 humanity.”    

 The Opposition urges the Government to adequately explain to the Australian people, and  the school communities, in what situations do the “non-cooperation” of parents lead to  the detention of children. Surely there are other options as to how children will be  handled by the Department.”  

 

 “The Government needs to get to the circumstances of these particular children, why they  suffered through no fault of their own, and why the Department keeps asserting these  cases are sensitively handled with the school’s support.”     

 “The trauma of having their school friends taken in front of them without any  explanations, is for many children, incomprehensible and unforgettable and it is  something which the Government clearly fails to understand”, Mr Ferguson concluded.
