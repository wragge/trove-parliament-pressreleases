 ACT Keeps Attracting More Settlers

 The Australian Capital Territory continues to appeal to migrant and refugee entrants.

 More than 1200 people arrived and settled in the ACT in 2004-05, which was well up on the previous year’s total of 1050 and the largest number  under this Coalition Government.

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, released the 2004-05 figures today, with the largest  number of people settling in the ACT from the United Kingdom followed by New Zealand, China and India.

 Senator Vanstone said the ACT arrivals had increased 15 per cent compared to the 1994-95 total of 1001.

 On the national front, more than 123 000 people arrived and settled in Australia in 2004-05, up 40 per cent on the 1994-95 figures.

 ‘Australia has a wonderfully rich and diverse society as a result, with nearly one in four of Australia’s 20 million people born overseas,’ Senator  Vanstone said.

 ‘On top of these figures are the growing numbers of people becoming permanent residents after arriving in Australia, such as overseas students  who apply for skilled migration onshore.

 ‘Our ongoing commitment to new and innovative visa programs and the increased efficiency and integrity of immigration processing means that  Australia continues to attract more and more people from around the globe.’
