 AUSTRALIAN FABIAN SOCIETY ANNUAL  CONFERENCE 

 

 Melbourne, 11-12 November 2005 

 

 Healthy and green cities 

 

 Senator Kim Carr 

 Shadow Minister for Housing, Urban  Development, Local Government and  Territories 

 Thank you for the invitation to participate in this panel discussion - I feel  honoured to be able to take part in the first national conference of the Australian  Fabian Society. The Fabian Society has a long and proud history, taking forward  progressive thinking in Australia. 

 I am especially pleased to be asked to speak on the topic of cities and city  planning. 

 These are aspects of national policy that the Fabian Society pioneered. 

 In 1958, the Society published “The Housing Crisis in Australia”, written by a  passionate advocate of urban consolidation and renewal, Ray Burkitt.  A decade  later “Whitlam on Urban Growth” was published in the lead-up to the election of a  national Labor government in 1972. 

 As Shadow Minister for Housing, Urban Development and Local Government I  hope to bring an integrated perspective to the issues we are going to talk about. 

 I am in the final throes of developing a policy discussion paper on housing, urban  development and local government. I want to take the opportunity today to  indicate the possible policy directions we have been thinking about, and to invite  your feedback and contributions. 

 We are a long way from settling on a definite set of policy positions to take to the  next Federal Election, but we do have some ideas to raise. 

 Housing and the urban environment: square one 

 Almost 80 per cent of Australians live in our cities and towns.  In 25 years, 20  million of the projected 25 million of us will live in urbanised areas of over  100,000 population. 

 Our living environment - our homes and their surroundings, and the services and  facilities available in our neighbourhoods - provide the very bedrock of our daily  lives. Our homes and our living environment are what I call “square one”.   

 If you don’t have a decent place to live, you lack the necessary conditions for  everything else in life - finding and keeping a job, education and training  opportunities, your health.   

 So housing and cities policies - or the lack of effective policies - affect almost all  Australians quite profoundly. 

 Yet the current Federal Government has no Minister with express responsibility  for urban development.  For almost ten years, it has virtually ignored this set of  issues, implying that they are exclusively the responsibility of state and local  governments. 

 Labor begs to differ about that.  We believe that a national approach and national  leadership are needed. 

 Labor understands that people want to be able to pursue their own goals as  individuals.  But unlike the conservatives we also believe strongly in the concept  of community - that how we live together collectively is actually critical to our  wellbeing. 

 I believe that these questions are so crucial to our lives and our collective futures  that a national government has to get involved in them. 

 Today I am going to talk about some of the ways I think a national Labor  Government might take some responsibility for the future of our cities. 

 Sustainability: a key theme 

 A key theme and a key priority for any approach to the future of our cities is that  of sustainability. 

 One aspect of that is, of course, environmental sustainability. Labor is looking at  some policy ideas that would involve the national government - through planning  processes and building codes, for example, in lifting the standards at the national  level. We want more efficient energy use, and greater use of renewable energy in 

 homes and public buildings, as well as in industry. Our policy goal is to reduce  household energy consumption without at the same time further reducing  housing affordability - another burning issue for all spheres of government, but  one I won’t be more than touching on today. 

 But I am not going to concentrate on the “green” side of sustainability today. I am  sure that others will do that. Instead I want to look at other aspects of this  concept: the other factors that contribute to the goals of a healthy and  prosperous community. Social and economic sustainability have to go hand in  hand with environmental sustainability, and are just as important as policy goals. 

 Fighting poverty and accepting diversity 

 In particular, I believe the national government must take responsibility for  challenging poverty and supporting diversity in our suburbs. 

 We can and must learn from the disastrous events that have recently taken place  in cities both here and - more dramatically perhaps - abroad. 

 The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans shocked the world.  Now in  France, there is widespread and violent unrest, which has spread to over 200  cities and towns and which the authorities seem unable to control. 

 What can we learn from these experiences about policy priorities for our own  cities? 

 First of all, we see in Hurricane Katrina the terrible effects - in terms of human  suffering - of climate change. 

 Secondly, we must learn from that disaster that ageing and inadequate urban  infrastructure (like the New Orleans levy banks) cannot be ignored.  Australia has  a looming problem in this regard.  We need a national strategy that works with  the states and territories and local government to prioritise, and then to fund,  projects to replace and repair our drains, sewers, roads and public transport  systems. 

 Thirdly, we have to tackle head on the shameful problem of poverty in some  parts of our own cities. Just as in New Orleans and in France, poverty in  Australia is not evenly spread.  Our cities contain geographical regions of  significant economic disadvantage.  

 Fourth - although Australia is arguably more socially inclusive, and tolerant in  terms of race, religion and ethnicity, than France - we have not always done  everything we can to ensure that new arrivals are truly welcomed and that their  transition to life in Australia is a successful one. 

 This last is a particular concern in current circumstances, when our refugees  increasingly come from societies that differ sharply from the Australian  mainstream.  Family size and structures are different; social mores and  expectations are different.  To someone who has spent the past ten years living  in a refugee camp in the Sudan, Footscray must indeed be foreign in the most  profound sense.   

 And this is clearly a Commonwealth responsibility - you cannot make decisions  about who comes here without taking some responsibility for how they settle in. 

 And for those who may argue that I am over-egging the pudding:  We only need  to look at the riots early this year in Macquarie Fields in the outer-west of Sydney  to see that Australia’s cities are not immune from the disquiet caused by  concentrated unemployment and welfare dependency.  We need only look at  Redfern a year earlier to know that race can be a burning issue in our own cities. 

 Labor’s approach 

 Labor is the party of social justice.  I suppose it should not be surprising that we  should be thinking hard about these issues, while a conservative Government  sits on its hands.  But what can we do? 

 For a start, one goal of housing policy must be to make it easier for  disadvantaged Australians to live close to employment opportunities.  There is  growing evidence that the Government’s rent assistance policies don’t achieve  this goal - and we are looking very carefully at this issue. 

 But the fact is that not everyone can actually live in the desirable inner suburbs. 

 So it is also critical that Australians living in our outer suburbs are not out of sight  and out of mind.   

 As a nation, we must ensure that Australian suburbs are designed to include and  engage everyone, rather than marginalising the poor or reinforcing the impacts of  income inequality. 

 As a nation, we simply cannot have a situation where poor people are confined to  suburbs defined by poor services. 

 It is important to recognise that once suburbs and regions reach a state of  widespread poverty and dislocation there are so many inter-related problems that  single agencies working on their own find it hard to make a dent. 

 It is critical in such areas that all service delivery agencies - Commonwealth,  state and local - work together with the community to implement coordinated  responses. 

 Some local and state governments have recently undertaken substantial and  effective urban revitalisation projects to address just such problems.   

 The Victorian Labor Government’s Neighbourhood Renewal program, for  example, demonstrates what can be achieved when the ideas and resources of  governments, local communities, businesses and the not-for-profit sector are  brought together.   

 To date, Commonwealth Government involvement in these strategies and  projects has been limited. 

 Labor believes it is time for the Commonwealth Government to show leadership,  working with state and local governments, and with local communities, to  address the problems of Australia’s neediest suburbs. 

 The evidence is clear - there is a strong case for government intervention in  urban and regional development aimed at tackling social and economic  disadvantage. 

 These are not just the views of social reformers - even conservatives  acknowledge the need.  Recent government reports from bodies such as the  Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics highlight that the development of  local infrastructure and social capital is as important as business development in  revitalising disadvantaged regions. 

 In tackling these problems, we should heed the lessons of successful past  programs - such as Better Cities.  This is not to say that we should replicate  Better Cities, but to acknowledge that it achieved some really good things.  If we  can learn the lessons of success, avoid the pitfalls, and combine this knowledge 

 with what we know has worked in other countries, there is potential to make a  real and positive difference in our cities. 

 Our national government must also work in partnership with state and local  governments, and with community groups, to ensure that new arrivals are truly  welcomed and that their transition to life in Australia is a successful one. 

 In this regard, it is not only services that fall strictly under the heading of  “settlement support” that are important.  Urban development policies which  identify and address the barriers to inclusion and participation facing  disadvantaged Australians are critical to helping our newest citizens too. 

 Inclusive communities are healthy communities 

 Australians don’t all want to live the same way or in the same place. But we all  want to live in a prosperous community, a safe community, a socially, culturally  and physically healthy environment. 

 The idea of sustainability forms an umbrella that covers the policies and goals  that can bring this about. 

 I have discussed how important I think it is that the national government take  some responsibility for promoting sustainability in our cities - economic,  environmental and social - but how are we going to achieve this? 

 

 Bringing it all together 

 At the moment, Commonwealth programs that deal with these issues are  fragmented across departments.  Local government lies within the Transport and  Regional Services department; housing lies within FACS; there is no-one really  responsible for urban development; and the responsibility for the building code is  within the Industry department. 

 One way to deal with this might be to establish a Commonwealth Department  that brings together responsibility for housing, urban development, local  government and related issues. 

 I am also talking to my colleagues about other, more innovative ways in which we  can: 

 â¢ improve coordination at the Commonwealth level in delivering its  responsibilities in urban development; and 

 â¢ build partnerships with state, territory and local government, business and the  community sector.  

 We need to use whatever structures we end up with to take action to improve the  future of our cities - but not only in addressing poverty and disadvantage, and  the social and economic problems it causes, which have been the focus of my  talk today. 

 We also need to work with other levels of government to help our cities conserve  water and energy, manage changing settlement patterns and demand for growth,  fix up our ageing urban infrastructure and ensure that our councils have the  capacity to manage the increasing demands placed on them. 

 The health, security and sustainability of Australian communities are really the  central goals of all government policy. Because most of us live in cities, urban  policy is a crucial priority for any government - and that means a national  government as well as the other levels of government. 

 And because of that, there has to be national leadership, and a national  government committed to actual, concrete policies, designed to take us forward  in partnership with government at state, territory and local levels. 

 The Howard Government has shamefully neglected urban policy.  A Labor  Government would turn that around.  That is a challenge I look forward to.
