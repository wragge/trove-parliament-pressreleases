 Australia should open door for climate refugees   

 Australia should recognise climate change refugees as a legitimate category of  humanitarian refugee, according to Australian Greens Leader Senator Brown.   

 "Without changing the number of refugees accepted into Australia, a simple  broadening of the definition of humanitarian refugee, can hold the door open for  refugees from low-lying countries affected by rising sea-levels."   

 "As a leading global climate polluter, Australia should recognise that the future  is uncertain for many millions of people in the world's coastal areas - and that  we are ready to play our part."   

 "Only yesterday the President-elect of the Maldives, Mohamed Nasheed said his  country would begin buying land in Australia and other countries as an  insurance policy against global warming."   

 "Most of the land mass of the Maldives stand little more than a metre above sea  level - a story repeated in Australia's region in the form of Kirabati, Tuvalu and  the Cartaret Islands off Papua New Guinea."   

 Senator Brown said unless all countries participated in cutting carbon  emissions, climate refugees would become an increasing reality.   

 "Australia's hand should be out and open to climate refugees as sea-level rises,  deserts spread, and a host of other climate changes make more parts of the  world uninhabitable."
