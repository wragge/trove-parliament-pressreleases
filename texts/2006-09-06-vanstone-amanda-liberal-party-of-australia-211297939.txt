  Media Release  Senator the Hon Amanda Vanstone  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  I I 

  201.06 Wednesday 6 September 2006 

  Australia Welcomes 1234 in Need in August  Victoria embraced 406 refugee and humanitarian entrants in August from the 1234 welcomed to  Australia last month. Queensland, South Australia, New South Wales and Western Australia  welcomed 732 entrants between them as Australia continued to provide a home for those most in  need. 

  The refugee and humanitarian entrants who arrived in August settled across Australia as follows: 

  ACT 23 Tasmania 41 

  NSW 261 Victoria 406 

  Queensland 152 Western Australia 139 

  South Australia 180 Northern Territory 32 

  “This Government’s commitment to maintaining tough border security plays an integral part in  enabling Australia to offer 13,000 places annually under the refugee and humanitarian program,”  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, said. 

  “Because we have limited the number of unauthorized arrivals seeking asylum, we’re able to give  our places to those waiting patiently in camps throughout the world. 

  “Of those to arrive in August, 518 were refugees. Many of these people have been waiting in  refugee camps for years. 

  “Australians can be proud that we provide a secure home for these people, who have already  suffered enough by being forced to flee their country of nationality. 

  “These people have been determined to be refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR) and assessed to be in need of resettlement.” 

  The remaining 716 people were Special Humanitarian Program (SHP) entrants. They were forced  to leave their home country after being subject to substantial discrimination. They also have family  or other links with Australia. 

  Included in the 1234 arrivals were 787 people from Africa, 370 people from the Middle East and  South West Asia, and 64 people from South East Asia. 

  “In August there were 24 family groups (a total of 87 people) who were granted visas under a  dedicated programme for women at risk. These are women and their dependants who have lost  male family members and are therefore particularly vulnerable,” Senator Vanstone said. 

  This week Australia will again welcome 264 refugee and humanitarian entrants. Included in the 264  arrivals are 148 people from Africa, 100 people from the Middle East and South West Asia , and 12  people from South East Asia. 

  New South Wales welcomes 87, with others settling in Victoria (72), Western Australia (454,  Queensland (29), South Australia (28) and Tasmania (3).
