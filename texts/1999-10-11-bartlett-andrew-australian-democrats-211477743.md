  Refugee program not a revolving door

  Democrats welcome support for allowing refugees 
to stay

  

  Minister Ruddock is not representing the sentimen ts of most 
Australians in pushing the Kosovar refugees to leave Australia, according 
to the Australian Democrats.

  

 “Minister Ruddock has turned the refugee program 
into a revolving door. There’s much fanfare when refugees arrive and 
then the Minister just decides when he thinks they should quietly leave,” 
said Senator Andrew Bartlett the Democrats’ immigration spokesperson.

  

 “The Minister’s comment that the $3000 we are 
giving them when they leave is cheaper than letting them stay, shows 
a poor understanding of the humanitarian aspects of the refugee program 
and the benefits migrants bring to a country.”

  

 The Democrats have urged Minister Ruddock to allow 
the Kosovar Albanian refugees to stay and apply for Australian residency, 
if they wish. Liberal and Labor Premiers from South Australia, Queensland 
and Tasmania, members of the federal opposition, the Albanian community 
have also urged Minister Ruddock to reconsider any forced deportation 
of the Kosovar refugees.

  

 “Most of the Kosovar refugees have already returned 
home. We have always been talking about a small group who would want 
to stay. There is no good reason for the Minister to forcibly deport 
them.

  

 “It is not surprising that Premiers from states 
with declining populations are keen to have people stay. We know we 
need to encourage people to live in areas away from major capital cities. 
Here’s the perfect opportunity,” said Senator Bartlett.

  

 “The Government created a new class of refugee visa 
for the 4,000 Kosovo Albanians refugees, specifically to give the Government 
the legal standing to remove them at a future time. They have used the 
same system for the East Timor refugees.

  

 These refugees have ‘use-by’ dates. Presently, 
haven is temporary and they are not allowed to apply for permanent residency 
unless they first leave Australia again. It is unacceptable that their 
fate is at the mercy of the Minister for Immigration without right of 
appeal.”

  

 “The Prime Minister was there welcoming the refugees 
at the airport when they arrived. Will he be there waving them goodbye 
if they are forcibly deported?” asked Senator Bartlett.
