 The Hon SUSSAN LEY MP  Federal Member for Farrer  Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs 

 

 

 26 November 2009   

 MEDIA RELEASE  For immediate release   

 

 Labor stops the bling but not the boats   

 

 The recent Australian Customs and Border Protection seizure of fake Tiffany and Co  jewellery on 20 November is welcomed, but the vigour and urgency applied to stopping this  illegal cargo has not been applied in the case of the surge in unauthorised boat arrivals,  including the one that arrived today.    

 In relation to the jewellery haul, the Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O’Connor, declared: “It  is vital that we stop these goods at the border”. But he makes no similar declaration on the  seventh unauthorised boat arrival to be apprehended in less than two weeks.    

 Today’s boat was intercepted this morning only six nautical miles north of Christmas Island  with 49 passengers and 3 crew aboard.   

 Minister O’Connor claims that the “Government remains vigilant and committed to protecting  Australia’s borders.”   

 There have been more than 300 people arrive over the past two weeks in seven  unauthorised boats. They were drawn to Australia by the Rudd Government’s weakened  border protection regime - this is hardly protecting our borders. Since Labor weakened  Australia’s border protection laws in August last year, 55 boats carrying 2450 people have  arrived.   

 It is indeed vital that the boats, like the jewellery, be stopped and that Australia returns to an  orderly process of assessing and accepting refugees.   

 Why doesn’t the Minister express as much concern about stopping the boats as he does  about stopping the bling?
