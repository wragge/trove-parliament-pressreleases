 T he  statement  is  long  o ve rdu e . I trust  i t  i s  not  to  be  regarded  

 as  v a l e d i c t o r y .

 W hat  is  not  welcome  is  the  steady  erosion  of  c o h e s i o n , s t a b i l i t y

 AND DIRECTION IN AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN POLICY UNDER THE HAWKE

 G overnment . - -

 T h i s  has  come  about  p r i n c i p a l l y  for  two  reasons  .

 T he  f i r s t  has  repeatedly  been  commented  upon  . T he  fact  that  

 L a b o r ' s  F orei gn  P o l i c y  d e c i s i o n s  are  not  based  on  a  r e a l i s t i c

 CALCULATION OF WHERE THE NATION'S INTEREST LIES AND HOW TO DEFEND 

 IT ~ BUT INCREASINGLY ON THE NEED TO PREDICATE DECISIONS ON HOW 

 THE FACTIONS MIGHT LINE UP, AGAINST A N  UNDERCURRENT OF CREEPING 

 NUCLEAR PACIFISM, AND ANTI-AMERICANISM-

 T he  SECOND CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THIS MALAISE IS MORE SUBTLE "

 F or  what  also  concerns  me  about  L a b o r ' s  foreign  p o l i c y  is  the

 LACK OF A BROAD VISION OF THE VALUES THAT UNDERPIN THE WESTERN

 A l l i a n c e , and  the  role  we  should  be  p l a y i n g * .

 I t  i s  wrong  to  b e l i e v e  that  regi onal  i n i t i a t i v e s  can  be  taken

 WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR GLOBAL CONSEQUENCES ·

 YOU CANNOT IN SOME WAY QUARANTINE THE REGION FROM GREAT POWER 

 INFLUENCE AND THE CONFLICT OF IDEAS·

 T he  F oreign  M i n i s t e r  c r y s t a l i z e d  t h i s  a t t i t u d e  i n  a  recent  speech  

 to  a  F a b i a n  s o c i e t y  conference  on  A N Z U S  when  he  stated  and  I  

 quote  -

 - 2 - .

 " A nzus  as  an  element  of  regi onal  s t a b i l i t y  must  not  mean ' that

 IT SHOULD ACT AS A CLOAK BEHIND WHICH GREAT POWER INFLUENCE 

 IS BEING OR WOULD- BE IMPOSED UPON PURELY REGIONAL AFFAIRS 

 AND ISSUES·" -

 W hat  the  M i n i s t e r  is  sayi ng  in  effect  is  l e t ' s  r e s t r i c t  the

 INFLUENCE OF BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION IN OUR 

 REGION. . · · .

 W hat  th  i  s  . forgets · is  that  we  are  part  of · the  W estern  A l l i a n c e -  

 T hat  t h i s  is not  j ust  a  grouping  of  powers , but  the  embodiment ,  

 of  c er t a i n  ideas  and  values  which  are  d i s t i n c t l y  part  of  the  

 A u s t r a l i a n  c h ar a c t e r · â   : .

 A u s t r a l i a  and  the  W estern  A l l i a n c e ·

 I deas  that  we  should  be  a s s e r t i v e l y  proud  to  represent  and  that

 WILL BE LOST IF TOTALITARIAN SOCIETIES BECOME THE MAIN REPOSITORY 

 OF POWER·

 W hat  t h i s  also  forgets  i s  that  i t  i s  the  US presence  that  has

 UNDERPINNED GROWTH AND STABILITY IN OUR REGION · ·

 To PUT IT BLUNTLY, IT IS AMERICAN POWER THAT GUARANTEES THE 

 SURVIVAL OF FREEDOM·

 W h i l s t  the  G overnment  has  g iv e n  foreign  p o l i c y  p r i o r i t y  to  the

 REGION, IT HAS NONETHELESS GOT IT WRONG · ~

 B ecause  whatever  you  do  in  the  region  must  f i t  w i t h i n  your  global

 PERSPECTIVE · YOU CANNOT SEPARATE THEM- LABOR HAS TRIED·

 A nd  what  are  the  consequences  of  L a b o r ' s  a c t i o n s ?

 Q u i t e  s i m p l y , we  have  become  a  pale  and  reluctant  partner  in  the  

 W estern  A l l i a n c e - .

 W e  have  a  role  t o . play  and  we  are  not  p l a y i n g  i t ·

 I nstead  of  supporti ng  our  f ri ends  and  a l l i e s , we  undercut  t h e m ·

 I nstead  of  assuming  an  a c t i v i s t  and  g e n u i n e l y  i n t e r n a t i o n a l i s t

 L abor  used  the  p a r a l y s i s  of  the  U n i t e d  N a t i o n s  system  as  an

 INDULGED IN A TYPICALLY SHODDY COMPROMISE OF PRINCIPLES- THE

 B oth  the  I s r a e l i  and  E g y p t i a n  G overnments  have  asked  L abor  to

 RECONSIDER ITS DECISION- THE PRIME MINISTER HAS REFUSED·

 " I  FOUND THAT THE MFO IS PERFORMING ITS TASK EFFECTIVELY AND HAS  

 CONTRIBUTED TO STABILITY IN AN OTHERWISE TURBULENT REGION·" H e  

 STATED THAT BOTH ISRAEL AND EGYPT ARE COMMITTED TO PEACE AND THAT  

 THE MFO HELPED MAKE THIS POSS IBLE·

 I ask  the  G overnment , what  changed ? .

 Is e i t h e r  E gypt  or  I srael  no  longer  committed  to  a  s e t t l e m e n t ?

 Is the  presence  of  t h i s  peace - ke e p i ng  force  mo  longer  relevant  . -  

 the  answers  a r e , of  course , NO- ; .

 T he  p o in t  is  not  whether  some  other  country  could  or  has  been

 PROBLEMS ARE OF A DIFFERENT SORT- .

 T he  G overnment  has  pushed  the  case  of  c o m p r e h e n s i v e  mandatory

 ECONOMIC SANCTIONS, TAKEN UNILATERAL ECONOMIC MEASURES, AND 

 RESORTED TO THE PERSONAL V I L I F I C A T I O N  OF SPORTSMEN, TO THREATS 

 AGAINST C I V I L  LIBERTIES IN AUSTRALIA, AND TO THE DENIAL OF FREE

 CONFRONTATIONAL- -

 I n  THE END, WHAT WAS ACHIEVED, WAS MODERATE AND SENSIBLE- I t  

 COULD HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED, HOWEVER, WITHOUT RANCOUR, WITHOUT 

 THREATENING TO SPLIT THE COMMONWEALTH, AND -WITHOUT THREATENING TO.

 I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT IS A SENSIBLE COURSE AT THIS TIME TO 

 TAKE STEPS WHICH WILL DAMAGE, DESTABILISE OR UNDERMINE THE SOUTH

 How CAN YOU EXPECT SOUTH AFRICA TO PEACEFULLY REFORM WHEN YOU 

 THROW IT INTO ECONOMIC C R I S I S ; WHEN YOU DAMAGE THE MAIN ENGINE OF 

 REFORM, WHICH IS THE ECONOMY; WHEN YOU THROW BLACK FAMILIES WITH 

 JOBS AND A STAKE IN PEACEFUL TRANS I T I ON·.  . I NTO ' UNEMPLOYMENT; AND 

 WHEN YOU DESTROY NEIGHBOURING BLACK ECONOMIES-
