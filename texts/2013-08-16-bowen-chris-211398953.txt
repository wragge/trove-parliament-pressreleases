 CHRIS BOWEN: Well thanks for coming everybody. It’s great to be here at this great  facility. I’m delighted to be here, in my electorate today, at Foodbank NSW, with my  friend and colleague Chris Hayes, the Member for Fowler - a first class Member of  Parliament - and Gerry Anderson the Chief Executive of Foodbank. What we’ll do  ladies and gentlemen, I’ll make this announcement, Gerry will say a few words, we’ll  answer questions about Foodbank, then I’ll say some things about other matters and  you can ask me questions about other political matters without detaining Gerry for  that part of the press conference.  

 Well, today I’m announcing that the Rudd Labor Government will commit $2 million  in funding to Foodbank NSW to let them expand their services. Foodbank provides a  great service taking left over food from supermarkets, from farmers, from other  sources and providing it to charities, which in turn provide it to needy people. It’s  been run out of Wetherill Park here for some time and this service has been so  successful that it has outgrown this particular facility.  

 For some time I’ve been talking to Foodbank, as they have been talking to other  members of both federal and state governments about this problem. And the need is  for $8 million for a new facility so that Foodbank can triple the number of people,  needy people that are supplied with food. 

 Foodbank is able to contribute $4 million to this task. I recognise and congratulate  the NSW Government for their $2 million commitment, and today the Federal  Government will match that $2 million commitment which will be the final piece in the  jigsaw puzzle which will allow Foodbank to expand to new and better premises. I  certainly hope, Gerry, those premises are nearby because it’s great to have  Foodbank here in Wetherill Park, but I know wherever you end up you will be in 

 Western Sydney, not only creating jobs in Western Sydney but providing a great  service.  

 I want to acknowledge all of the people who have been working on this for some  time, as I said we’ve been in discussion with Foodbank for some time working  towards this day. I also acknowledge John Robertson, the Leader of the NSW Labor  Party, a big fan and supporter of Foodbank, and I know a regular visitor here. He’s  been talking to me about this over several months and I’m very glad that we’re able  to make this important commitment today.  

 A re-elected Rudd Labor Government will ensure $2 million for Foodbank, so that  this great service can not only continue to provide food for needy people, but can  expand that service to many, many more people in need. I’m going to ask Gerry to  say a few words and then as I said, I’ll say a few things about other matters and  answer your questions. Gerry. 

 GERRY ANDERSON: Thanks, thanks Chris. This is a wonderful opportunity for  Foodbank NSW to move into new premises. The year just completed we provided  six million meals and our target by 2020 is to provide 18 million meals, so we need to  warehouse much bigger. We’ve got a shortlist of potential warehouses within a five  kilometre radius of where we are and we hope within 12-15 months we’re in a new  warehouse. And this now just completes the end of the fundraising and we’ll still  need to raise a few more funds but this is a wonderful opportunity and when you told  me about it yesterday I was extremely excited. And I just want to say thanks for a  wonderful opportunity.   

 The bipartisan support that we’ve got, because we’re just trying to feed and help  those hungry Aussie’s so it’s important that we get the support of everybody. Thanks  to Chris and thanks to the Federal Government and the Prime Minister, we really  appreciated that support. So on behalf of the board of Foodbank and all our staff and  volunteers, a great thanks. Thank you.   

 BOWEN: Thanks Gerry. As I said we’ll take some questions on this matter and then  we’ll deal with some other matters. Questions on Foodbank? All good? Alright,  thanks Gerry, we won’t detain you for the political section of this press conference. 

 Well ladies and gentleman, another day, another day we see the Liberal Party at  sixes and sevens on their costings. Last night we saw Tony Abbott on the 7.30  Report confirm that they may not release their costings until the last week of this  election campaign. There’s simply no excuses for this, nowhere for Mr Abbott and Mr  Hockey to hide.  

 There is only one reason the Liberal Party would be hiding their costings and how  they’re going to pay for their promises and fill in their budget black hole. That’s  because they know where they’re going to cut, but they don’t want to tell the  Australian people where they’re going to cut. The reason they don’t want to tell the  Australian people where they’re going to cut is because they’re very fearful that if  they’re honest about this, then people won’t want to vote for their deep cuts to  health, to education.  

 This morning on Sunrise, Mr Hockey refused to rule out funding cuts to health,  funding cuts to health. This Government, on the other hand, in the Economic 

 Statement I released Friday before last, increased funding for hospitals across  Australia. This just shows how desperate they are.  

 Also, I understand, I read in the paper today, Mr Hockey is going to release a new  methodology, a new way of costing his promises. Well there is a methodology, there  is a way already in place, it’s called the Charter of Budget Honesty, it was introduced  by Mr Costello, and it should be honoured. It involves getting your policies costed by  the Treasury, the Department of Finance, or the Parliamentary Budget Office.  

 Now Mr Abbott and others have been boasting that they’ve submitted 200 policies to  the Parliamentary Budget Office for costing. Well if that’s the case, why do they need  this new methodology that they’re going to announce today? Why not just use the  central agencies of government. Why? Because they know their sums don’t add up.  They know the only way they can make their budget work is deep cuts. Deep cuts to  fill their budget black hole.  

 Now, we’ve been here before. At the last election Mr Abbott and Mr Robb went out  and said they had a wonderful costing methodology. They said, ‘We’ve got this great  accountancy firm, nobody can question this costing’, they said before the 2010  election. And then, of course, after the 2010 election the Department of Finance  identified an $11 billion black hole in their sums and then the accountant’s involved  were fined $5,000 each for breaching professional standards because of the work  that was done. 

 We shouldn’t be going through this again. These guys have form. There’s a Charter  of Budget Honesty in place, it should be accepted, it should be implemented, it  should be honoured by both sides of politics. That’s what we’re doing, and it’s what  they should do. The only reason for not doing it is to hide your cuts from the  Australian people.  

 We’ve been here before again in Queensland. We saw Campbell Newman tell public  servants there’s nothing to worry about - and I think Queenslanders now know what  and LNP government means when it comes to basic services, when it comes to  health funding, when it comes to education, when it comes to deep cuts across the  board.  

 Happy to answer your questions.  

 JOURNALIST:  (inaudible)… costings at the last election? 

 BOWEN: I don’t accept the premise of that question. We, at the last election, abided  by the Charter of Budget Honesty. That’s what we do and that’s what the Liberal  Party should be doing as well. 

 JOURNALIST:  Has Labor been left fighting thin air because the Coalition isn’t  releasing its costings for two weeks?  

 Bowen: Well, we are pointing out to the Australian people that there is no excuse. I  mean Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey have had plenty of time to do their homework. This  election is hardly a surprise. Everybody’s known this election is coming. They  haven’t done their sums, their policies don’t add up. As is evidenced by the fact that  last week we had Mr Hockey saying, quote-unquote, ‘We won’t be adding our  policies up’. Because they don’t add up.  

 So they have no excuses. Nowhere to hide. They said they’d wait for the Pre-Election Economic Forecast to be released. Well, guess what? It’s been released.  It’s out, it’s there for all to see. They have no excuses for now not releasing their  policies and their costings, and doing so today. 

 JOURNALIST: Do you have any response to the Coalition’s plan for asylum  seekers? 

 BOWEN: Well, I understand Mr Abbott just said that he couldn’t guarantee that  people wouldn’t be given a permanent visa at the end of the process, I mean, this is I  think the Liberal Party pretty desperately trying to get this issue back on the agenda  because we have the Papua New Guinea plan in place and it is starting to have  some effect. Some effect. It will take time to have its full effect.  

 Also, I see Mr Abbott promising to remove the rights of appeal to courts. Well, that’s  something that I think will be very, very difficult for him to implement. I’m not sure this  policy has been thought out properly.  

 JOURNALIST: Is there concern by the poll results out today? 

 BOWEN: Oh look, you’re going to see plenty of polls between now and Election Day.  Some are going to show different things. I believe we are very competitive at this  election. I believe that we can win this election. I believe we are the underdogs, but I  believe the Australian people are deeply concerned about Mr Abbott and his deep  cuts that he is hiding from the Australian people. We will be prosecuting the case  with great vigour right to the Election Day, and I believe we can win it.  

 Okay? Great, thanks guys.
