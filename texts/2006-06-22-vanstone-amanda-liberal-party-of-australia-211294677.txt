  MIGRATION AND REFUGEE TRIBUNAL NEW APPOINTMENTS 

  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, today announced the  appointment of 15 new members to both the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and the  Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT). 

  “The cross-appointment of full-time and part-time members, which began two years ago, is  now complete,” Senator Vanstone said. 

  “The process allows the tribunals to operate more effectively and efficiently by providing  them with the flexibility to allocate members to address changes in workload in each  tribunal. 

  “In particular, it will increase the RRT’s capacity to respond to the Government’s recently  proposed time limit of 90 days for RRT reviews.” 

  Each of the newly appointed members will be serving a three-year term, from 1 July 2006  to 30 June 2009. 

  These new appointments, together with the reappointments announced earlier, will result  in a total membership of 97, all of whom are cross-appointed to both tribunals (one  principal member, six senior members, 16 full-time members and 74 part-time members).  The deputy principal member position for the RRT is currently filled by a senior member on 

  an acting basis. 

  The MRT provides independent merits review of general migration decisions and the RRT  provides independent merits review of decisions relating to protection visas. 

  The following people were appointed as full-time members of both tribunals: 

  Ms Ann DUFFIELD  Mr Paul FISHER  Mr George HADDAD 

  The following people were appointed as part-time members of both tribunals: 

  Ms Diane BARNETSON , Ms Jane MARQUARD  Ms Mary CAMERON  Ms Catherine CARNEY  Ms Gabrielle CULLEN  Mr David DOBELL  Ms Diane HUBBLE
