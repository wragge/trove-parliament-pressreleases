 Greens Optimistic!

 On election eve, Greens Senator Bob Brown says that while it is always hard to get the 14% needed state-wide for a quota, he is optimistic about retaining his seat in Tasmania and for the Greens to win 3 or 4 new Senate seats on the mainland.

 "Our strong humane stand on asylum seekers and our priorities on funding public education and health and benchmark policies for the environment have had many Labor and Liberal voters saying they will back us in the Senate.

 "In Tasmania, where both Liberal and Labor are for the chainsaws, and the Greens are for saving old growth forests and their wildlife, this issue is a critical determinant.

 "Nationally we have come from behind but, based on great community support, run the best campaign of all the parties.  It has been a great effort by Greens everywhere.  It is now up to the voters", Senator Brown said.
