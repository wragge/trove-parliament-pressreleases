 KELVIN THOMSON Media Release from the Shadow Minister for Sustainability, the Environment & Heritage Member for Wills  Tuesday, 13 January 2004  Government must monitor and advise on cadmium levels on Nauru  News  footage  from  Nauru  has  shown  detained  asylum  seekers  playing  soccer in clouds of dust on an improvised sporting field within the compound.  This dust is likely to be the same dust which has been collected from homes on  Nauru  and  shown  to  have  dangerously  high  cadmium  concentrations.  Many  Nauru  islanders  have  cadmium  concentrations  in  blood  and  urine  samples  that  are  as  high  as  those  as  people  in  Japan  who  were  adversely  affected  by  the  cadmium  induced  ailment  known  as  itai  itai  disease,  which  can be fatal.  Cadmium is taken up by the human body just as effectively by inhalation as by being swallowed.  Given  this,  I  have  written  to  the  Prime  Minister  asking  what  measures  the  Government has adopted or will adopt to monitor the health of refugees and asylum seekers, as well as that of Australian employees working on Nauru.  I  have  further  asked  whether  refugees  and  asylum  seekers  placed  on  the  island  have  been  warned  of  the  potential  dangers  of  high  cadmium  intake,  and what action the Government is taking to minimise any harmful exposure to excessive cadmium levels on Nauru.  The  potential  hazard  associated  with  cadmium  on  Nauru  is,  or  should  be,  well  known  to  the  Australian  government.  The  question  is  whether  the  government  is  adequately  discharging  the  duty  of  care  that  it  has  in  this  situation.
