  SWEEPING CHANGES TO REFUGEE AND IMMIGRATION DECISION MAKING 

  Significant changes will be made to refugee and immigration decision making and  review systems to improve efficiency, credibility and accountability, the Minister for  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock announced today. 

  "The major change will be to collapse the current three portfolio review bodies into two  review tribunals," Mr Ruddock said. 

  The change follows the Coalition commitment to undertake a review of immigration  decision-making, with particular attention being paid to the membership, role and  performance of the Immigration Review Tribunal (IRT) and the Refugee Review Tribunal  (RRT) . 

  Currently protection visa (refugee) applications are processed in a two-tier decision  making structure. A primary decision on an application is made by the Department of  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. If unsuccessful, an applicant can seek review  before the RRT. 

  Most immigration applications have a three tier merits assessment process, with a  primary decision by the Department, a departmental review by the Migration Internal  Review Office (MIRa) and an independent review by the IRT. 

  "The changes will bring all migration processing into line so that there is a two-tier  merits assessment of applications," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "This will mean merging MIRa with the independent IRT, while the RRT will remain a  separate body dealing exclusively with review of refugee applications." 

  A number of other legislative measures will be introduced to make my portfolio  Tribunals more flexible and to improve their performance, while reducing the scope for  abuse . 

  To shorten overall processing times and to discourage frivolous applications there will  be restrictions on work rights, review application periods and a change in the structure  of the review application fee. 

  "A significant measure will be to impose a post-decision application fee of $1,000 for  the RRT. This will not impose a burden on bona fide refugees and will act as a  deterrent for people intent on abusing the system," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "The $1,000 fee will only be payable if the RRT finds that the applicant is not a refugee.  Applicants assessed as meeting refugee criteria will pay no RRT fee." 

  A number of other administrative measures will be introduced to achieve efficiencies in  primary and review decision making.

  "My Department will take a more strategic approach to protection visa applications ,  giving greater priority to straightforward applications and using more streamlined  methods, such as reduced documentation where appropriate," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "Other measures will include clearer articulation of my expectations and directions to  Tribunal members and improved utilisation and reduced duplication of resources." 

  The changes to the structure of review bodies will take effect after appropriate  legislative changes . 

  "The changes announced by the Government will re-establish credibility, integrity and  confidence in the immigration decision making process," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "Not only will people with bona fide applications be given a decision more quickly, but  those intent on fraud or deception will not have the benefits of a delayed decision." 

  The changes to the immigration review process are consistent with foreshadowed  Government moves to introduce further reform of merits review tribunals across all  portfol ios. It is proposed that all tribunals will eventually be consolidated into a new  Admin istrative Review Tribunal. 

  However the revamped immigration and refugee review process would remain a  discrete division within the new tribunal. 

  Further announcements will be made shortly on other enhancements to the decision  making process.

  DETAILS ON REVIEW OF REFUGEE AND IMMIGRATION DECISION MAKING 

  Tribunals 

  The changes to tribunals are designed to improve flexibility and performance, so that  delays are reduced and more consistent decisions are made.   " Principal Members of Tribunals will be given clear authority to apply efficient  processing practices, including the ability to give directions on the operation of 

  the tribunals and the conduct of reviews   " applicants will not be able to delay hearings where prescribed notice of a  personal hearing has been given  personal hearings will be at the discretion of the tribunal member considering an 

  application   " Tribunals will be able to use telephone and other media to conduct hearings   " Where appropriate, documentation will be reduced to allow more efficient  utilisation of tribunal members' time 

  In line with Government policy to move towards cost recovery, the fees for  applications to MIRO and the IRT will be increased to $500 and will be non " refundable  The period in which an unsuccessful onshore applicant can seek review will be  reduced from 28 to 14 days 

  Primary Decisions 

  In line with Tribunal changes, procedures will be streamlined to ensure greater  productivity  Greater priority will be given to processing straightforward applications, so that  applicants in genuine need and those without substantial claims are dealt with  quickly.  Where a protection visa application is made, access to work rights will be limited  to those people who have been in Australia for less than 14 days in the past 12  months .
