 Dr Richard Di Natale responds to AMA president’s comments about health care of refugees on  Nauru Island  

 I am appalled by this morning’s comments on ABC radio from AMA President, Dr Michael Gannon, says  the Leader of the Australian Greens, Dr Richard Di Natale. 

 “Dr Gannon stated that refugees on Nauru are receiving very high levels of health care, when we know  this couldn’t be further from the truth. 

 “Less than two years ago, under the previous AMA president, the AMA was campaigning to condemn the  poor health care refugees on Manus and Nauru receive. 

 “Since then, things have got worse and we know that what little health care is available to refugees on  Manus and Nauru is nowhere near adequate, let alone the huge risks to health and to life these people  are facing. Suggesting otherwise this morning, and insinuating that lawyers making a case for Australia to  uphold its commitment to the Refugee convention is a reason not to bring these women to Australia is  astonishing from the AMA head 

 “The President of the Australasian College of Physicians just yesterday said they are very concerned by  report that refugees on Manus and Nauru are being refused medical transfers to hospitals in Australia,  where they would be able to receive the proper care they need. 

 “This is part of an alarming change of direction from the AMA leadership, where evidence appears to be  sacrificed in order to support a political position. 

 “Dr Gannon also recently said we should be as concerned about unemployed coal miners as the health  effects of climate change. 

 “Australian doctors I have spoken to are increasingly concerned about the direction of the AMA  leadership."
