 New Member Appointments to the RRT MPS 56/2002

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today announced the appointment of five new full-time and three new part-time members to the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) for a period of two years commencing on 1 July 2002.

 "The new members bring with them years of experience and outstanding leadership skills from various organisations and will be an asset to the RRT, contributing to its professionalism and productivity," Mr Ruddock said.

 The RRT is responsible for providing independent merits review of decisions to refuse or cancel protection visas made by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

 There are currently 65 members in the RRT. The new appointments will take the membership of the RRT to a total of 73 members - 45 full-time members (one principal member, one acting deputy principal member, three senior members and 40 full-time members) and 28 part-time members.

 The increased resources will help to further reduce processing times for protection visas.

 The new full-time member appointees are:

 Mr Ian Lincoln; Dr Alan Moller; Mr Robert Seamer; Ms Jill Toohey; and Mr Robert Wilson.

 The new part-time member appointees are:

 Dr Mirko Bagaric; Mr David Connolly; and Mr David Reese.
