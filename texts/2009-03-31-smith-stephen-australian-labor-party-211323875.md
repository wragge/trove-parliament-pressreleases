 Statement to the International Conference on Afghanistan 

 The Hague 

 31 March 2009 

 

 Mr Chairman, 

 

 I thank our hosts for organising this Conference, which comes at a critical time 

 for Afghanistan and its region.   

 

 Australia welcomes increased engagement by the United Nations in Afghanistan 

 and the excellent work of its Special Representative, Kai Eide. 

 

 I also acknowledge our Afghan partners here today, led by President Karzai.   

 

 I underline the Australian Government’s continued appreciation of our close 

 collaboration with the Netherlands, our good friend and close partner in Oruzgan 

 Province. 

 

 Australia remains committed to Afghanistan.  We are the largest non-NATO 

 military contributor.  We have committed $250 million over three years to 

 development, civil reconstruction and training efforts.  We are making and will 

 continue to make a contribution to both Army and Police training.

 Australia urges the international community to reaffirm its collective resolve at 

 this Conference and beyond to build a stable and secure Afghanistan. 

 Australia also welcomes the recently announced United States review of its 

 strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan.  We agree with the aims of the review and 

 its conclusions.   

 

 The review supports Australia’s analysis that we must confront what I describe as 

 the current hotbed of international terrorism along the Afghanistan/Pakistan 

 border.  That can only be done by a coordinated military, reconstruction and 

 political effort.   

 

 We have all seen how an Afghanistan preyed upon by international terrorists has 

 terrible consequences for the Afghan people, the South and Central Asian region 

 and the world.   

 

 Along with our friends and partners, we are committed to working with the 

 Governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan to tackle this threat at its source.   

 

 We are committed to giving the Afghan people the means to secure their own 

 future.  We welcome renewed focus on training, on building the capacity of the 

 Afghan National Army and Police to achieve this aim.

 We will also work with others to help Pakistan tackle its grave internal security 

 and economic challenges.   

 

 Mr Chairman, a stable Afghanistan is in Australia’s national interest.  It is clearly 

 in the interests of Afghanistan’s neighbours and region, as well as the 

 international community as a whole.   

 

 In working to achieve this vital objective, Australia especially welcomes a focus 

 on two key elements at this Conference.   

 

 First, the need for a comprehensive approach to Afghanistan, better integrating 

 military and civilian efforts across the country.  It is clear that a military campaign 

 alone will not solve Afghanistan’s problems.   

 

 As well, there must also be, at some stage, dialogue and reconciliation led by the 

 Afghan political leadership. 

 

 Second, we are encouraged to see so many of Afghanistan’s South and Central 

 Asian neighbours here.  Australia urges you to work closely with the United 

 Nations and International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Countries to achieve 

 progress in Afghanistan.

 We all stand to benefit if Afghanistan is safe from terrorists and drug traffickers, 

 as well as no longer being a source of displaced people and refugees.   

 

 This year, 2009, is a critical year for Afghanistan.  Australia considers it vital that 

 Afghanistan has credible elections this year.  We have provided $8 million to 

 support the elections and we are considering additional measures of assistance 

 for that election.   

 

 This year, ISAF must also work to break the strategic stalemate it confronts in 

 Afghanistan.  The Afghan Government must also do much more to tackle 

 corruption, to tackle narcotics, as well as provide services and reach out to its 

 citizens.   

 

 The Australian people - like those of most other countries represented today - 

 have seen mounting sacrifices.   Two brave and dedicated Australian soldiers 

 were killed in Afghanistan within one week this month.  For Australians, these are 

 terrible losses.   

 

 Afghanistan remains difficult and dangerous.  Despite the risks,  the international 

 community cannot afford to walk away.  Australia will continue to work with the 

 Governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan, the United Nations and all here 

 today.   

 

  5

 We must never again give terrorists free rein to intimidate the Afghan people and 

 threaten its region and our world.
