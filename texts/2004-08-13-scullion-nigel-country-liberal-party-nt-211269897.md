 Senator Nigel Scullion today welcomed Australian Government funding of $239,765  over four years to the Multicultural Council of the Northern Territory to deliver a  support service for children and families of immigrants and refugees in Darwin.   

 Funding was approved as part of the Australian Government’s Local Answers  initiative under the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy.    

 The Northern Territory receives about 50 families of refugee status each year and this  number is increasing annually.  Existing services for these families are limited.   

 The Multicultural Solutions Program will provide a place and service where children  and families of immigrants and refugees with a non-English speaking background can  interact with one another and link with service providers.   

 This funding will be used to employ a project officer to help these families to identify  their needs and to link them to appropriate support services, eg. Education, health,  employment opportunities etc.     

  “The Stronger Families and Communities Strategy is an Australian Government  initiative giving families, their children and communities the opportunity to build a  better future and the Northern Territory has the capacity and multicultural character to  assist in this area.   

 "This assistance will give families in our community the power to develop their own  solutions and help them to help themselves" said Senator Scullion.
