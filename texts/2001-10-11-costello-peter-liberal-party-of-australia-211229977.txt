 SUBJECTS: Labour force figures, refugees, ALP ads

 TREASURER:

 Well, this morning's labour force figures show that the unemployment rate in September, fell. It fell from 6.8 to 6.7 per cent. There was a large drop in part-time jobs, but a big increase in full-time jobs. Some 53,000 new full-time jobs were created in the month. And since the Government has now been elected that means that there have been 800,000 new jobs created in Australia. Obviously the Australian economy is going to be affected by the world downturn, like every other country in the world, particularly the downturn in the United States, and Japan, and Europe. But we go into this downturn in a stronger position because we have re-paid $60 billion of Labor debt because our interest rates are low. And the fact that the unemployment rate has fallen in the month, I think, will be received as reassuring news, welcome news by the Australian public. It means that the unemployment rate, which has come down, means that there are still job opportunities out there, and it means that there is still some strength being shown by the Australian economy.

 JOURNALIST:

 Has there been an impact, with the loss of the Ansett jobs though yet?

 TREASURER:

 Well yes, the loss of the Ansett jobs would be reflected in the figures, but you have got to remember, the press find it easier, I am not being critical of the press, the press find it easier to focus on an area where a job has been lost, and yet find it harder to focus on an area where jobs have been created.

 And it is a matter of deep regret, what has happened in relation to Ansett, but the good news is, notwithstanding what happened to Ansett, jobs were still being created, full-time jobs were still being created in other areas of the economy.

 JOURNALIST:

 Would you expect unemployment to rise as we move into that downturn?

 TREASURER:

 Pardon?

 JOURNALIST:

 Would you expect unemployment to rise as we move into this downturn?

 TREASURER:

 Well, the unemployment rate is 6.7 per cent in the month of September. We actually forecast an average unemployment rate of 7 per cent for the

 year, so the unemployment rate is a little lower than we actually forecast. So, that is good news. I hope that it continues to be lower than we forecast, but I must point out to you that we did forecast over the course of the year, a 7 per cent average unemployment rate. But this is better than that, and that's good news for the economy.

 JOURNALIST:

 (inaudible) participation rate, has dropped by about 48,000 people. That 48,000 people have stopped looking for work and have just given up?

 TREASURER:

 The participation rate has declined. Yes it has.

 JOURNALIST:

 By 48,000, is that (inaudible)?

 TREASURER:

 No, no that is not the figure from the participation rate. The participation rate is a percentage rate of the number of people who are looking to work. And the participation rate has been very high over recent months, and it has come back a little bit in relation to these figures. But overall, and the labour force figures bounce around a lot, overall, these labour force figures show the following; the unemployment rate declined, there was a large drop in part-time jobs, there was a big rise in full-time jobs. Now, Mr Beazley was banging on on radio this morning about the importance of full-time jobs, and ...

 JOURNALIST:

 So we're not quite as many part-time as we gained full-time?

 TREASURER:

 Hang on, let me finish my statement. Mr Beazley was banging on this morning on AM, saying the only thing that counted was full-time jobs. And he was obviously hoping that full-time jobs would fall in the month of September. And what he said was, he said part-time jobs were the icing on the cake, he said, but the only thing, what gives you certainty that you 're going to have a decent life at the entirety of your working life is your access to a full-time job. So, he was banging on this morning about the importance of full-time jobs. So, presumably he will welcome the fact that full-time jobs increased by some 53,000. And I hope that he does. I hope that he wasn't just on radio this morning licking his lips and hoping for bad news. I can remember the last time he was here in Aston, he came down here on the day of the National Accounts, wishing and a hopin ', and a prayin'ï¿½and a thinkin', that the economy was going to go negative, and we

  

 came out with a strong growth figure. I have never seen somebody with a tail between his legs, as Mr Beazley was, back in June when the Australian economy re-bounded and showed considerable strength. Well, there he was a wishing and a hopin' and a thinkin' and a prayin', this morning, that full-time jobs would decline and they didn 't. And I hope that he has the decency to welcome the fact that full-time jobs have risen.

 JOURNALIST:

 Mr Costello, are you surprised by the fall in the unemployment nonetheless?

 TREASURER:

 Well, the unemployment rate is 6.7. We have forecast 7 per cent over the years. So we actually forecast in our Budget that the unemployment rate would be a little higher. But I am pleased to get that forecast wrong. This is the way you would rather be wrong with the unemployment rate lower than you actually forecast.

 JOURNALIST:

 Housing finance figures are also out, showing that housing finance has fallen and so has the purchases of new dwellings. Does that concern you?

 TREASURER:

 I wouldn't be worried about housing finance, because housing finance is coming off such an incredible rise. It has been so strong over the last 3 months, that there is considerable strength left in the housing construction market. And so that is coming off a very, very large rise indeed, in relation to finance and approvals.

 JOURNALIST:

 Do you think it dipped in anticipation of the First Home Buyers Scheme being cut off in December as previously scheduled?  

 TREASURER:

 I don't think so, because why would it dip in September if the grant was going to continue until December. Nobody would have been pulling back in September as a consequence of the grant because the grant was still there for October, and November and December, and now we know that the grant is going to be there for a good part of 2002 as well.

 JOURNALIST:

 Mr Costello, Mr Howard has been either unwilling or just hasn 't released the figures of how much it has cost the taxpayers for the latest refugee crisis. Are you able to reveal those figures?

  

 TREASURER:

 Obviously there have been some additional costs in relation to the Tampa, and in relation to the other boat people that have been picked up and taken to Nauru, and I think we are getting a handle on that and it will probably appear in the pre-election financial outlook, which is being released  ...

 JOURNALIST:

 ... (inaudible) what about the refugees that are being taken to Papua New Guinea, how much is that going to cost?

 TREASURER:

 ... which is being released next week. So, I will be able to give you a handle on that next week.

 JOURNALIST:

 Correct me if I'm wrong, Treasurer, but I believe the number of, the total unemployment figures, total employment ... have fallen by 48,000?

 TREASURER:

 As I said, the unemployment rate has fallen. There has been a large drop in part-time jobs, and there has been a large rise in full-time jobs&

 JOURNALIST:

 But haven't the unemployment figures (inaudible) ...

 TREASURER:

 ... and the overall number of full-time jobs increased by 53,000. And when you take into account part-time jobs, there was an overall decline in full-time and part-time employment, and a decline in the unemployment rate.

 JOURNALIST:

 But hasn't the unemployment rate only gone down because the participation rate has fallen? Employment figures actually gone backwards?

 JOURNALIST:

 I mean isn't it a bit of a mirage that the unemployment rate has  ...

 TREASURER:

 Well, hang on. The unemployment rate has fallen ...

 JOURNALIST:

 But isn't it a mirage, if  ...

 TREASURER:

 No, let me go through it. The unemployment rate has fallen. Now, I think it is a good thing when the unemployment rate falls, and when the unemployment rate rises, whether it's because of the participation rate, or whatever, that means that there are more people looking for work who can 't find it. What these figures show you in September, is that the number of people looking for work, who couldn't find it, declined. And it declined notwithstanding a very large fall in part-time employment, counteracted by a large rise in full-time employment. Now, the point I make is this. Mr Beazley was banging on today about the importance of full-time employment, hoping that full-time employment would go backwards. It didn't. Full-time employment went up. And so I think it is fair enough to say that if the unemployment rate declines, that is good news, I think we should welcome that. Certainly if it were going up, you wouldn 't be welcoming it, so I think we're entitled to welcome it if it falls.

 JOURNALIST:

 May I ask just what you think of, what is your reaction to Labor 's ad which targets you specifically?

 TREASURER:

 I was waiting for the punch line.You went right through the ad and there was no punch line ...

 JOURNALIST:

 Essentially it seemed to be saying you couldn 't make tough decisions.

 TREASURER:

 No, I thought it was actually suggesting that I could, because if you read it , they said that this was the guy that had made the tough decisions, on the Budget. If we hadn't made the tough decisions the Budget wouldn 't be in surplus, and the tough decisions on tax. And, don 't forget this, when Mr Beazley was in Government, he wanted a GST and he didn't have the ticker to introduce it. When he went into Opposition, he didn 't want a GST and now he doesn't have the ticker to remove it. But, we did it, and I must

 say, I saw the ad and I waited for the punch line, I thought it was yet to come.

 Thanks
