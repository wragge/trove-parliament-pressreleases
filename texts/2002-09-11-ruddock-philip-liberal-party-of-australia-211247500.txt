 New Registrar Appointment To MRT and RRT MPS 083/2002

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today announced the appointment of John Lynch as Registrar of both the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) for a period of three years commencing on 23 September 2002.

 The appointment will further contribute to the process of maximising administrative efficiency between the two Tribunals.

 The RRT is responsible for providing independent merits review of decisions to refuse or cancel protection visas made by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA).

 The MRT provides a single tier of review of general migration decisions made by DIMIA.

 A full-time member of the RRT since August 2000, Mr Lynch has excellent legal and management credentials and has many years of senior executive experience in both the Commonwealth and the New South Wales Public Service.

 I am confident he will be able to successfully bring these qualities to this dual Registrar position.

 Mr Lynch's appointment follows a nation-wide recruitment exercise in May-June this year.
