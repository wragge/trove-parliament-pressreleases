 Australian humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people

 Australia will provide humanitarian assistance worth $1.5 million for the Afghan people, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, John Kerin, announced today.

 The package targets both Afghan refugees in Pakistan and the rehabilitation needs of people inside Afghanistan. The assistance fulfils a $15m pledge by former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, to the United Nations Secretary General's

 1988 appeal for Afghanistan.

 "The political situation inside Afghanistan remains uncertain and the security situation has deteriorated," Mr Kerin said.

 "However, the daunting task of rehabilitating Afghanistan is continuing."

 Australian assistance will support food security, de-mining within Afghanistan and community education, health and literacy programs.

 Australian assistance for the Afghan people will be channelled as follows: â¢ $500,000 for World Food Programme food for work programs in Afghanistan â¢ $500,000 to the Office of the UN Coordinator for Afghanistan for

 de-mining and other activities in Afghanistan â¢ $232,000 for the work of the Red Cross, including an Australian Red Cross doctor, theatre nurse and anaesthetist for a surgical hospital in Kabul â¢ $183,000 to the International Women's Development Agency, to improve

 literacy skills and health care among Afghan refugee women â¢ $85,000 to Austcare for community education and literacy program in Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan.

 Australian emergency assistance to the Afghan people is administered by AIDAB, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau.
