 New Customs resources to back up tough border protection policy   

 The Howard Government’s tough and unwavering commitment to securing Australia’s borders will  continue through 2004-05, with the allocation of an extra $107.6 million to the Australian Customs  Service, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Chris Ellison, said today.    

 “Border protection remains vital in the protection of Australia against drugs, disease, illegal arrivals  and other threats, and the Government will continue to allocate suitable resources to this crucial task,”  Senator Ellison said.   

 The Australian Customs Service plays a major role in protecting Australia’s borders against a range of  threats. Customs will use extra funding to strengthen several key operational areas.   

 â¢ The fight against illegal fishing in the Southern Ocean will benefit from funding of $84.2 million  over two years delivering on the Prime Minister’s pledge of December 2003 that armed patrols will  be conducted against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Southern Ocean. 

 

 â¢ Customs officers will be able to board up to 80 per cent of all vessels at their first port of arrival  into Australia - up from the current level of 70 per cent - thanks to increased funding of $2.8  million in 2004-05. 

 

 â¢ The potential of better border protection through biometrics (unique identifiers such as facial  recognition) will be further explored through the provision of $3.1 million in 2004-05, reinforcing  Australia’s world-leading position in border-control technologies by extending the SmartGate trial  to a second international airport for holders of prototype Australian biometric passports, selected  passengers and enrolled aircrew. 

 

 “Customs currently inspects about 70 per cent of air cargo consignments by x-ray or physical  examination, up from 30 per cent in November 2001,” Senator Ellison said.     

 “Additional funding of $7.1 million announced in the mid-year aviation review will enable Customs to  conduct a field trial of new air cargo neutron scanning technology.    

 “This technology was developed in partnership with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial  Research Organisation (CSIRO) and has the potential to rapidly detect explosives, drugs and other  prohibited goods in air cargo containers,” Senator Ellison said.   

 In addition, funding of $10.6 million over two years has been provided in the 2004-05 Budget for sea  cargo examinations.  These examinations have increased 20-fold with the opening of container x-ray  facilities in Brisbane, Fremantle, Melbourne and Sydney.  These facilities have already been  instrumental in a number of significant seizures of narcotics and cigarettes. 

  BUDGET 2004-05 

 

 Customs now monitors 56 port areas and 88 separate wharves around Australia 24-hours a day, seven  days a week, using a sophisticated national closed-circuit television (CCTV) network.  The cameras  can be monitored from 23 different Customs locations.   

 In the area of passenger travel, all airlines are required to send advance passenger information to  Immigration and Customs using the Advance Passenger Processing (APP) system. This enables  Customs to check more than 90 per cent of passengers against immigration and law enforcement alert  lists before they arrive in Australia.   

 Customs has installed new travel document readers in all Australian International Airports which  assess passports for fraudulent features and use multi-spectral lighting to detect features such as hidden  patterns and emblems while also checking for signs of tampering.     

 The use of these document readers will assist Customs by identifying faults not visible to a human  operator and will significantly enhance Customs’ ability to prevent people from entering Australia  using false passports.  And at least 85 per cent of all air passengers’ baggage is either searched or x-rayed by border agencies on entry into Australia.   

 In the area of coastal protection, the Government continues to fund a 20 per cent increase in flying  hours for Customs Coastwatch Dash 8 electronic surveillance aircraft.  Additional funding previously  provided has enabled the Customs Marine Unit to double its sea days.   

 Satellite video transmission systems have also been fitted to all Customs National Marine Vessels,  enhancing their ability to provide information to client agencies while undertaking surveillance and  response activities.   

 Customs Coastwatch and Defence recently signed an Indigenous Land Use Agreement with the people  of two Torres Strait islands to facilitate a trial of the High Frequency Surface Wave Radar in northern  Australia, announced in the last budget.  The radar can detect surface vessels and low-flying aircraft  beyond the visible horizon.  If the trials are successful, this technology could provide 24-hour wide  area coast surveillance.   

 Customs will also receive $2.4 million over three years to facilitate passenger movements into and out  of Australia for the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games.   

 “This new funding to support the excellent work of Customs, as well as our strong co-operation with  other border agencies, will ensure that Australia continues to be protected from a range of external  threats,” Senator Ellison said.
