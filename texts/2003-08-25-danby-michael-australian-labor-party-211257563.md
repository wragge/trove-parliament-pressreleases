 Labor’s Commitment Ignored by Press, Pyne & Irwin  25 August 2003 

 Traditionally, both sides of Australian politics have been supportive  of Israel, however, in the wake of comments in Parliament last  week, Mr Michael Danby, Federal Member for Melbourne Ports said:  “I feel that the major speeches by Opposition Leader Simon Crean  and Foreign Affairs spokesman Kevin Rudd in support of the Jewish  state have been wilfully distorted by some, for partisan political  ends. The speeches show to the Jewish community Labor’s balanced  support for Israel.” 

 “The Liberal Member for Sturt, Mr Christopher Pyne, seems  dedicated to destroying the current bi-partisan support for Israel by  childishly focussing on an 18 month old report during a recent  parliamentary debate on the Roadmap, by the ACTU overseas aid  arm, APHEDA (Australian People for Health, Education and  Development Abroad),” Mr Danby said today. 

 Mr Pyne has also called on Mr Crean and Mr Rudd to “explain” why  Mr Laurie Ferguson, Mr Greg Sword and ACTU President, Ms Sharan  Burrow sit on the Board of APHEDA.  

 “I would also question Mr Pyne, and call on Mr Pyne, the Prime  Minister and the Foreign Affairs Minister to explain why the last two  Chairs of the Palestinian Friendship Group have been Liberal MPs,  Mr Ross Cameron and currently, Ms Susan Ley,” Mr Danby  continued. 

 “Unlike the meeting between AUJS (the Australian Union of Jewish  Students) and Labor’s Tanya Plibersek, where a journalist was  planted” Mr Danby continued, “I am sure Mr Pyne did not organise  for a journalist to ambush the heated meeting between Young  AIJAC (Australia/Israel Jewish Affairs Council) and Liberal Susan 

 Ley, the current Chair of the Palestinian Friendship Group”.  According to the AIJAC members present at that meeting, Ms Ley  presented a hardline view based on her years of living in the Arab 

 world. 

 MICHAEL DANBY MHR  Press Release from the Federal Member for Melbourne Ports  

 Mr Danby also stated that Julia Irwin, the Member for Fowler, last  week stated that that members of the Israeli Knesset were  promoting a policy of mass expulsion of Palestinians, and that the  process had already started. 

 “The story was sourced from an article by Ben Lynfield of the  Christian Science Monitor. What Ms Irwin fails to point out, is that  one of the papers which ran the story, The Seattle Times, later put 

 out a correction,” Mr Danby said. The correction reads as follows: 

 Correction: An Israeli action in the Tulkarem Refugee Camp on the  West Bank involved removing Palestinian men from the camp while  the Israeli Defense Forces searched for an Islamic Jihad leader 

 believed involved in suicide bombings. The militant was arrested in  the operation, which lasted three days, and the Palestinian men  were allowed to return to their homes. The headline on the original  story: “Israel starts mass expulsion of Palestinians” was in error.   (Source:http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/13467 0965_expel08.html ) 

 Mr Danby therefore continued: “So not only was the story incorrect,  the ‘expulsion’ was for the Palestinian’s own good, to protect them  during a military operation. This shows the responsibility of the  Israeli Defence Force, and the continued difference, and lack of  moral equivalence, between the Israeli Defence Force, who are  targeting terrorists, and Palestinian terrorists, who are targeting  civilians.”  

 “Ben Lynfield has a record of anti-Israeli reporting. Going through  some of Mr Lynfield’s recent reports, he has consistently focused on  the accidental deaths of Palestinian civilians, the targeting of  Palestinian terrorists and the settlements, instead of the deliberate,  targeted, mass killings of Israeli civilians,” Mr Danby continued. “It  is not surprising that regardless of the involvement of Israel and the 

 US in the Roadmap, Ms Irwin continues to focus on this minor, and  false, report, rather than condemning the murder of 20 people and  the wounding of 100, including 40 children.”
