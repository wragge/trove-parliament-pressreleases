 Statement on the passing of the Honourable Malcolm Fraser AC, CH, GCL    

 Australian Greens Leader Christine Milne    

 It is with great sadness that we mark the passing of former Prime Minister Malcolm  Fraser.    

 A hallmark of Malcolm Fraser’s enormous contribution to Australia was his compassion  and dedication to building a thriving and peaceful multicultural society.    

 Malcolm Fraser’s memory will never be free of the controversy and turmoil of the  dismissal of the Whitlam government. But then and also in later years he courageously  offered leadership in social justice and provided a vision for an Australia that truly  embraced a fair go for everyone including refugees.    

 Malcolm Fraser’s leadership in embracing refugees from war torn Vietnam made  Australia a better place. His courageous advocacy for refugees in more recent times has  been critical in challenging the breaches of international law and lack of human decency  that has shamed us as a nation.    

 On behalf of the Australian Greens I extend our deepest sympathies to Mr Fraser’s  widow, Tamie and his family and friends.
