  Senator Andrew Bartlett  Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson 

  Senate Committee to Examine Latest Bill  on Definition of Refugees  The Government’s latest Bill aimed at restricting the definition of a refugee has been  referred to a Senate Committee for proper examination, says Australian Democrats. 

  Australian Democrats spokesperson for Immigration, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said the Bill (Migration  Amendment Bill No 6) could have major national and international ramifications and required proper  scrutiny by all parties. 

  “This Bill affects the application of the Refugee Convention under Australian law and also relates to  other matters to do with protection visa applications and determinations, which would undoubtedly  have significant national and international ramifications.” 

  Senator Bartlett said, “The Government’s outrageous attempt last night to rush through its Border  Protection Bill providing sweeping new powers to the Government, would have dramatically restricted  the rights of asylum seekers to have their claims considered, making it all the more crucial that its  Migration Amendment Bill No 6 undergoes extensive scrutiny.” 

  “Given the Government’s politically driven approach to the complex issue of asylum seekers, any new  legislation must be examined thoroughly - particularly after the Government’s attempted to force its  Border Protection Bill through both houses of Parliament last night,” concluded Senator Bartlett. 

  The Senate Committee will report in October. ENDS
