 Media Release 

 Support doubled for the English as a Second Language -  New Arrivals Programme 

 8 May 2007 BUDB 28/07 

 The Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Hon Julie Bishop MP, today  announced that newly arrived entrants under Australia’s Humanitarian  Programme will attract double the amount of Australian Government funding for  English language tuition to improve their education prospects, as part of the  2007-08 Budget.  

 "Through this measure, an additional $127.8 million will be committed over the  next four years to assist with intensive English as a second language (ESL) tuition  for students entering Australia under a range of visa categories in the  Humanitarian Programme. This will be achieved through a doubling of the rate of  per capita funding provided to government and non-government education  authorities under the ESL -New Arrivals Programme for newly arrived  humanitarian students," Minister Bishop said. 

 "This important initiative is part of a whole-of-government strategy which focuses  on promoting successful settlement through learning English, getting a job,  committing to Australian values and participating in mainstream activities." 

 "The Australian Government is committed to supporting newly arrived  humanitarian entrants and acknowledges that English proficiency is a vital aspect  of successful settlement. For our humanitarian entrants in Australian primary and  secondary schools, intensive support to improve English language skills is one of  the best ways to improve the educational outcomes and future employability so  that they can participate more broadly in Australian society." 

 This initiative builds on the success of the existing English as a Second Language  - New Arrivals Programme which last year provided assistance for around 13,000  eligible primary and secondary students around Australia, including more than  5,000 humanitarian entrant students nationally.

 Supporting Information 

 Why is this important?  

 â¢ By assisting newly arrived refugee students to gain the English language  skills they need to function effectively in Australian society, this initiative is 

 an integral component of a whole of government strategy to support the  continued success of Australia’s Humanitarian Programme.   â¢ The English as a Second Language - New Arrivals (ESL-NA) Programme  contributes to the provision of intensive English language tuition for 

 recently arrived migrant students in order to improve their educational  outcomes and employability. While humanitarian students are currently  funded at the same per capita rate as other immigrant students, their pre-migration experiences mean that these students need, and are spending,  much longer in the initial phase of intensive English language tuition.   â¢ The Budget initiative will double the per capita rate of funding paid to 

 government and non-government education authorities for students in  primary and secondary schools who entered Australia on a humanitarian  visa - a substantial increase in the Government’s contribution.   â¢ The initiatives for improved whole of government support to newly arrived  humanitarian entrants are aimed at ensuring they do not lag behind other  permanent residents in English proficiency, education and employment.  

 Who will benefit? 

 â¢ Students entering Australia as part of the Humanitarian Programme.   â¢ In 2006 the ESL-NA Programme assisted around 13,000 students at a cost  of around   $69.1 million. More than 5,000 of these students entered Australia as part 

 of the Humanitarian Programme.   â¢ The change to the per capita payment made to education authorities,  based on the number of eligible students they enrol, substantially 

 increases the Australian Government’s contribution to support newly  arrived humanitarian entrants who need more sustained assistance to gain  crucial English language skills.  

 What funding is the Government committing to the initiative? 

 â¢ It is estimated that this initiative will cost an additional $127.8 million over  the four years to 2010-11.  

 What have we done in the past? 

 â¢ Australia-wide over the last three years, the ESL-NA Programme has  assisted almost 36,000 newly arrived primary and secondary students with  intensive English language tuition.  

 When will the initiative conclude? 

 â¢ The English as a Second Language - New Arrivals Programme is ongoing.
