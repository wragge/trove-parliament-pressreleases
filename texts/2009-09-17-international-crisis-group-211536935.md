 Development, Security and Transitions: Challenges and  Opportunities for International Engagement in Fragile  States,  Donald Steinberg 

 Presentation by Donald Steinberg, Deputy President, International Crisis Group, to  Overseas Development Institute, London, 17 July 2009. 

 I would like to begin by thanking the Overseas Development Institute for bringing  us  together  for  this  session  in  their  series  on  "Development,  Security  and   Transitions."  Today,  we  are  addressing  the  question  of  how  the  international  

 community  can  most  effectively  engage  in  fragile  states,  especially  those   emerging from conflict, in order to build stability and restore human security.  

 My  presentation  is  intended  to  provide  an  overview  for  the  other  panellists   addressing  the  nature  and  challenges  of  modern  peacebuilding  and  stabilisation   efforts, and the changes that have occurred over past decade or so that require a  much more comprehensive approach and have raised the stakes in terms of the  consequences for failing to effectively stabilise fragile societies. I will discuss the  associated -- if not causative -- factors related to instability, conflict and fragility,  and  how  these  impact  on  the  interlocking  challenges  these  societies  and  their   international benefactors face in creating or restoring stability and sustainability,  including: 

  z re-establishing personal and state-wide security;  

  z rebuilding responsible governance institutions worthy of popular support;  

  z restoring economic systems able to provide jobs and resources for meeting 

  post-conflict expectations;   z addressing demands transitional justice and accountability;  

  z restoring civil society networks polarized during conflict; and  

  z addressing the regional context.  

  I will also discuss both the reinforcing and synergistic nature of these challenges  and the contradictions among them, as well as the sequencing. And I would like to  conclude by mentioning the various adjustments, including institutional, that are  being made to address these factors.  

  I start from the premise that the traditional dividing line between issues of hard  national security and soft issues of human security have become hopelessly and  permanently  blurred.   Today,  there  are  no  "hard"  and  "soft"  issues:  crises  no   longer  remain  in  their  separate  and  distinct  boxes,  any  more  than  they  respect   national  borders.  There  is  a  broad  and  growing  recognition  among  practitioners   and  theorists  alike  that  conflict  prevention,  conflict  resolution  and  post-conflict   reconstruction form the bedrock of diplomacy and the promotion of international  security  interests  around  the  world.  You  cannot  achieve  or  even  adequately   address  the  fundamental  goals  of  promoting  governance,  sustainable   development, and international stability and cooperation in the presence of mass  violence. 

  The second major change is a growing complexity. I often address the incoming  senior official of the UN country team missions on the challenges they will face. In

  July, as I spoke to leaders of UN missions in Kosovo, Congo, Sudan, Nepal, Haiti,  CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Liberia, Central African Republic and Timor Leste, there was a broad  recognition of the fact that they now no longer stood at the top of a pyramid of  international engagement, able to systematically implement, article by article, the  mandate of a well-crafted and coherent Security Council resolution. 

  Today,  they  must  be  a  combination  of  diplomat,  military  commander,   humanitarian  relief  coordinator,  development  expert,  personnel  manager,  public   affairs  officer,  and  even  psychologist.  They  are  asked  not  only  to  keep  warring   parties apart, but to implement security sector reform, demobilise and reintegrate  armed  combatants,  support  transition  justice  mechanisms,  administer  elections,   empower and protect women, conduct humanitarian demining, return of refugees  and IDPs to their home, and a host of other duties.  

  Further,  negotiations  are  no  longer  just  between  two  warring  parties,  but  now   include  input  of  regional  organisations,  special  envoys  from  dozens  of countries,  civil  society  actors,  and  even  track  two  negotiators  empowered  by  who-knows-whom.  Regional  actors  have  become  increasingly  important.  Consider,  for   example, the role of ASEAN and China on Myanmar; the Arab League and African  Union  on  Sudan;  SADC  and  South  Africa  on  Zimbabwe;  Brazil  throughout  Latin   America;  and  India  on  Sri  Lanka  and  Nepal.  And  there  are  organisations  like   International Crisis Group only too willing to share our wisdom and tell them how  to do their job. 

  The stakes of game have risen dramatically, as global implications of failure have  become more profound: the failure to consolidate peace and stability in a country  no longer just impacts on people of that country, but opens door to training camps 

  for global terrorists; permits new routes for trafficking of persons, arms and illegal  drugs;  promotes  flood  of  refugees  across  borders  and  even  oceans;  facilitates   incubation of pandemic disease; and even brings piracy. 

  Finally,  resources  are  simply  not  as  plentiful  as  before.  The  proliferation  of   peacekeeping  missions  --  roughly  100,000  personnel  under  UN  missions  and   70,000 under other regional organisations -- has largely tapped out the supply of  troops and civilians, while the global financial and economic crisis has essentially  closed  the  assistance  pantry  for  peacekeeping  missions  and  post-conflict   reconstruction alike. When was the last time anyone talked about a new Marshall  Plan  for  a  specific  reconstruction  effort?  While  the  international  community   provides vast  amounts  of  disaster  assistance  once  conflicts  emerge, regrettably,  we struggle to find resources to prevent these emergencies from occurring or to  rebuild  societies.  Too  often,  we  seem  to  say:  "Billions  for  relief,  but  very  few   pennies for prevention or reconstruction." 

  This  reality  places  premium  on  anticipating  where  conflict  will  emerge  and   addressing  the  root  causes.  In  assessing  where  to  put  our  ounce  of  prevention,   the  effort  to  predict  where  conflicts  will  emerge  has  become  a  cottage  industry.   Research has identified a number of prime "associative" factors. Among the most 

  salient are:  

  z Lack  of  political  participation,  responsive  governance,  and rule  of  law. 

  Societies  must  have  safety  valves  to  permit  the  peaceful  redress of  grievances.  z Rapid  urbanisation  and  population  pressure  coupled  with weak  economies. 

  One  of  the  quickest  routes  to  conflict  is  when  alienated  youth do  not  see  opportunities within their societies and are susceptible to fanatics or zealots.   z Absence of institutions of civil society that draw populations together despite 

  religious, ethnic, class or political differences.   z "Location,  location,  location."   The  role  of  neighbors in  either  mediating  or 

  fuelling disputes is fundamental. Countries in bad neighbourhoods risk spill-over  from  armed  combatants,  refugees  and  arms  flows; those  in  good  neighbourhoods receive a powerful dampening effect on potential violence.   z Militarisation  of  society  or,  put  otherwise,  normalisation of  violence.  This 

  include the role of military and security forces in political structure, and the

  proliferation of small arms and light weapons.  z Closed  nature  of  society,  especially  to  international influences.  Closed 

  political  systems,  economies,  and  media  environment  are dangerous.  Conflicts are like mushrooms: they grow best in darkness.   z Upheaval during the past 15  years. Contrary  to the warning you get on an 

  investment prospectus, the past record is an indicator of future performance. 

  These are among the factors that we need to monitor as indicators and potential  triggers of conflict. We cannot do much about many of these factors, nor can we  stop  natural  disasters  that often  translate into  conflict. Still,  every  drought  does   not have to become a famine, and every weak or poor state is not condemned to  instability and abuse.  

  In studying more than two dozen successful and failed peacekeeping efforts since  World  War  II,  we  have  found  that  six  key  challenges  must  be  addressed  nearly   simultaneously,  since  each  of  these  challenges  feeds  into  the  others.  These  six   challenges are restoring security, building a political framework, kick-starting the  economy, ensuring justice and accountability, promoting civil society, and getting  the regional context right. 

  On  security  front,  international  peacekeepers  can  provide  a  buffer,  but  credible   local  security  forces  must  quickly  take  over  to  provide  a  sense  of  stability,   normalcy and rule of law to everyday life. International support for security sector  reform is usually essential to ensure that forces are well-trained, disciplined, and 

  adequately  paid  so  that  they  do  not  exploit  and  abuse  the  populations  they  are   supposed to protect. Women must be amply represented in these forces, in part  to ensure that law enforcement is "community-friendly" and that women who have  been  abused  are  comfortable  coming  forward  with  complaints.  There  must  be   effective  programs  to  disarm,  demobilise,  and  reintegrate  ex-combatants,   including  militias.  Child  soldiers  must  put  down  their  AK-47s  and  pick  up   schoolbooks.  

  The second challenge is to restore legitimate political framework. We must build  confidence  in  government  at  national  and  local  levels;  transform  armed   movements into political parties; and build effective legislatures and judiciaries to  counter-balance  the  power  of  the  executive.  The  quick-fix  of  creating  a   government of national unity including all competing forces is rarely a viable long-term solution. Similarly, the premature holding of elections can create a winner-take-all  power  dispensation  that  is  itself  a  prelude  to  new  conflict  from   disempowered  minorities.  A  culture  of  accountability  and  transparency  must   emerge  in  government,  along  with  an  effective  system  to  protect  human  rights.   Decentralisation  and  local  empowerment  must  be  balanced  against  need  for   strong central authority in fragile states. 

  Third,  economic  renewal  is  often  defined  in  strictly  physical  terms  as  the   rebuilding of roads, clinics, schools, power grids, and houses. In truth, long-term  development  means  reviving  agriculture,  creating  conditions  needed  to  attract   local and foreign investment, ensuring greater equality in income distribution, and  creating jobs. As noted, in the wake of youth unemployment rates of upwards of  90 per cent in some countries, there is little surprise that in addition to their brutal  forced conscription of child soldiers, renegade leaders like Foday Sankoh, Joseph  Kony, and Jonas Savimbi have lured  disaffected  young  people  with a  siren  song   that offers quick if venal  empowerment and meaning to their lives. But meeting  expectations of a post-conflict peace dividend in the current financial crisis will be  difficult:  not  only  is  foreign  assistance  under  siege,  but  foreign  investors  are   increasingly  seeking  safe  havens  and  eschewing  risky  post-conflict  countries,   diaspora  communities  are  slashing  their  remittances  homeward,  and  weak   commodities  prices  and  rising  debt  servicing  requirements  are  taxing  local   reserves.  

  The  fourth  challenge  is  coming  to  grips with  past  abuses  and  atrocities.  Clearly,   nations and individuals who have suffered from grievous treatment must balance  immediate  accountability  and  long-term  national  reconciliation.  Too  often,  

  Page 3 of 5 International Crisis Group - Development, Security and Transitions: Challenges

  transitional justice is addressed through amnesties tantamount to men with guns  forgiving other men with guns for crimes committed against women and children.   There is no one-size-fits-all approach to transitional justice: whether it is action by  local  courts,  the  International  Criminal  Court,  a  truth  and  reconciliation   commission like in South Africa, the gacaca community court system in Rwanda,  or  ad  hoc  international  tribunals  in  cases  where  local  courts  are  inadequate,   ensuring  accountability  is  essential  to  rebuilding  concept  of  rule  of  law  and   eliminating a culture of impunity.  

  A  fifth  challenge,  often  ignored,  is  re-creation  of  civil  society.  Groups  of   academics, lawyers, teachers, unions, and women are the glue that holds society  together and serve as safety valves to permit the peaceful redress of grievances. 

  Such  groups  are  frequently  polarised  during  conflict,  often  due  to  conscious   "divide-and-rule"  strategies  by  national  or  factional  leaders.   Disadvantaged   minorities, including IDPs and refugees, must be  drawn into the mix. Women in  particular  are  not  only  the  primary  victims  of  conflict,  but  a  key  to  peace   consolidation. Bringing women to peace table improves the quality of agreements  reached, and involving women in post-conflict governance reduces the likelihood  of  returning  to  war.  The  single  best  investment  to  revitalise  agriculture,  restore   health  systems,  and  improve  other  social  indicators  after  conflicts  is  girls'   education.  It  has  been  said:  "Educate  a  boy  and  you  educate  an  individual;   educate a girl and you educate a community."  

  The  final  challenge  is  getting  regional  context  right.  Neighbours  are  best   positioned  to  provide  a  powerful  dampening  effect  on  potential  violence.   Comprehensive peace-building must recognise differing yet often synergistic roles  to be played and interests to be pursued by neighbouring countries, each with its  special relationships and contacts with key actors. It is often useful to have formal  structures:  ad  hoc  "friends  groups"  or  conflict  resolution  committees  of  such   regional and sub-regional organisations can serve this purpose.  

  As  we  review  these  requirements,  it  is  important  to  recognise  the  need  for   sequencing and application to the unique situations in each country. In all cases,  there  will  be  a  hierarchy  of  requirements:  in  many  situations,  the  need  for  a  

  restoration of security -- not only military stabilization but addressing the needs of  human  security  --  is  the  first  among  equals  without  which  little  else  --   governance, economic reconstruction, rebuilding civil society, and the rest -- can  take place.  

  Further, we need to acknowledge the internal contradictions at play within and  among these categories. For example, if societies re-establish security through a  strengthening of the military and/or a reliance of regional warlords, this can pose  a  serious  threat  to  the  re-establishment  of  a  credible  governance  structure.   Similarly,  empowering  and  providing  legitimacy  to  the  national  government  can   easily empower leaders whose interests are more related to their own interest --  including "rent-seeking opportunities" and consolidation of personal power -- than  to more altruistic goal. Stated simply, an election might get you an Ellen Johnson  Sirleaf, but it might also get a Joseph Kabila.  

  My fellow panellists will address the new tools that are being developed to address  these  challenges.  These  include  integrated  peace  operations  that  flow  naturally   from  peacekeeping  missions;  the  UN  Peacebuilding  Commission,  that  is  helping   coordinate  the  actions  of  relevant  UN  agencies,  bilateral  donors,  international   financial  institutions,  governments,  and  civil  actors;  in-house  government   coordinating  bodies,  such  as  START  in  Canada,  S/CRS  in  the  United  States,  to   draw together the various economic, social, humanitarian, and military efforts to  support reconstructing states; and the NATO "comprehensive approach".  

  I  want  to  go  back  to  the  beginning  of  my  presentation.  I  said  then  that  the   dividing line between "hard" and "soft" issues has blurred or vanished. While that  may be true in reality, unfortunately, mindsets in the corridors of power have yet  to  internalise  this  notion.  Non-military  tasks  related  to  conflict  prevention  and   peace  consolidation  still  suffer  from  "second -class"  citizenship  among  foreign

  actors. Indeed, they are too often referred to as "soft side" of foreign policy.  

  In  fact,  there  is  nothing  soft  about  holding  warlords  and  other  human  rights   violators accountable for past abuses or insisting that women have a seat at the  table  in  peace  negotiations  and  post-conflict  governments.  There  is  nothing  soft   about ensuring that roads and villages and farmlands are free of landmines; that  governments  are  empowered  to  deliver  health  and  education  services  to  the   population;  or  that  neighbouring  countries  and  world  powers  alike  cease  their   meddling and play a positive role in building regional peace and security. 

  These are in fact among the hardest the challenges we face in stabilising fragile  states, and I suggest the Overseas Development Institute for drawing us together  here today to move this process ahead.  

  Thank you.
