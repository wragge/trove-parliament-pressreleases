 WARRNAMBOOL CITY COUNCIL A SHINING MULTICULTURAL EXAMPLE   

 Federal Member for Wannon, David Hawker, has praised Warrnambool City Council for its work in  promoting the benefits of migration and cultural diversity to its community.   

 Congratulating the council on winning the Australian Government’s National Awards for Local  Government, Award for Excellence, Mr Hawker said the Council’s Migration to Warrnambool  project was developed in an attempt to promote population growth and employment in Western  Victoria through migration.   

 “Warrnambool City Council worked with the community, private sector and government  organisations to resettle some 15 refugee families originally from the Sudan, in Warrnambool,”   Mr Hawker said.     

 “Twenty-three of the new residents are already in full-time work, and all the families are in private  housing.’’   

 He said the work of the Warrnambool City Council held important lessons.   

 “Local governments are taking on a role in their communities that extend well beyond what was  traditionally seen as a council’s domain.  They are, put simply, in the business of building better  communities.   

 “In regional Australia, this role is more and more one of leadership.  Local governments are well-placed to make the right connections and bring key players together.”    

 Mr Hawker said the success of the project was a tribute to the inclusive and considered approach  the council took as well as the openness and initiative of the local community.   

 “Importantly, the Council has now written a how-to guide to help other councils wanting to take a  similar approach to revitalising the economic, social and cultural life of their community,”  Mr Hawker continued.   

 The awards, announced at the Australian National Museum on Sunday 7th November, reward and  highlight local governments’ resourcefulness in finding better ways to deliver services and develop  local solutions to challenging and often complex issues.
