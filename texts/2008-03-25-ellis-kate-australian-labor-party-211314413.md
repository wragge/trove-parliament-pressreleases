 The Minister for Youth, Kate Ellis, today announced the names of the 100 outstanding  young Australians who will help shape the nation’s future at the Rudd Government’s 2020  Youth Summit.     

 Ms Ellis said delegates were drawn from across the community, including high schools,  universities, industry, the arts and small business. 

 “It was fantastic to witness such a huge response of over 1200 submissions to our call for  nominations last month,” Ms Ellis said. 

 “The quality and diversity of the delegates will bring a fresh and innovative outlook to the  task of improving our country’s future.” 

 Delegates include:   Nicholas Rokkas, 15 years old, from NSW   Nicholas is the youngest delegate selected to participate in the Youth 2020 Summit. He  was named the 2007 Sustainable Living Champion after volunteering his time to work on  several projects with a particular focus on the environment.  

 Tim Goodwin, 24 years old, from VIC   A former member of the National Indigenous Youth Leadership Group, Tim is very  interested in the representation of indigenous communities and has worked for a number  of years on youth projects. In 2002 Tim was part of the Australian delegation to the United  Nations General Special Session on Children in New York. 

 Mohammad Al-Khafaji, 17 years old, from SA   Mohammad is studying a Bachelor of Engineering (Software) at Adelaide University. As a  refugee who has resettled in Australia he has been awarded for his academic success in 

 science and mathematics. Mohammad is keen to see a higher level of youth participation  in the government sector.   

 Felicity Harris 24 years old, from TAS   As a Regional Arts Development Officer Felicity works with a broad cross section of the  community. Felicity, as a young mother, understands the economic and social pressures  that come with raising a family and works on projects to engage rural mothers in the  community.

 The 2020 Youth Summit will be held in Canberra on 12 and 13 April, and give delegates  aged 15-24 an opportunity to tackle 10 critical challenges for Australia’s future.  

 Ms Ellis said 10 participants from the 2020 Youth Summit along with co-chair, Hugh  Evans, will be invited to attend Australia 2020 on 19 April, further strengthening young  Australians’ input into an important forum on the future of the nation.  

 “The Rudd Government is committed to giving young people a stronger voice in  government,” Ms Ellis said.
