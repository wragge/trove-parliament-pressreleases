 TURNBULL JOINT DOORSTOP WITH SUSSAN LEY - WATER BUYBACK  SCHEME, BORDER PROTECTION, ECONOMY, ETS 

 The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP  

 Leader of the Opposition 

 E&OE  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well it’s great to be here with Sussan today. We’re going out to Berrigan to visit some dairy farmers, irrigated 

 dairy farmers and have a range of community meetings to discuss the challenges of irrigated farming in these 

 very tough times.  

 The Labor Party has massively bungled, tragically bungled the whole water reform agenda. When Sussan and I 

 lost government in 2007, when the Howard Government was defeated, we left the Labor Party with the legislative 

 tools to reform water management in the Murray-Darling Basin and with $10 billion of cash to spend on 

 replumbing rural Australia, both on-farm and off-farm. To date they have only spent money on buying back water 

 entitlements. There are no big irrigation schemes being replumbed. There is practically nothing being spent on 

 on-farm irrigation efficiency. It was a great vision, a revolutionary vision that we had in government, of water 

 reform. We left it to the Labor Party. We’d done all the hard work. We passed the laws. We’d had the money 

 allocated and they’ve done nothing with it.  

 But of course it’s not the only failure of Labor Party policy. The extraordinary, continuing collapse, catastrophic 

 collapse of policy in terms of border protection - and Sussan of course is very well aware of this having just been 

 to see to the detention centre on Christmas Island - this collapse in border protection policy is again in the 

 papers with reports that Kevin Rudd, in a desperate effort to save face, has been offering special deals to the 

 asylum seekers on the Oceanic Viking. Now he needs to be fair dinkum with the Australian people and tell us 

 what is the special deal he has offered these people? What is the special deal that he has offered them in order 

 to persuade them to leave the boat so that he doesn’t lose face, so that he can deliver on his promise that they 

 will disembark in Indonesia? It seems like he’s offering them a guarantee of settlement in Australia. What type of 

 signal does that send? That is just telegraphing a signal in letters a mile high, ‘Come to Australia, Kevin will fix 

 you up’. It is an extraordinary act of weakness, a collapse of leadership and it sends an unequivocal signal to 

 people smugglers and their customers to come to Australia in an unauthorised way.  

 Now Kevin Rudd says that the only factors that are driving this surge in unauthorised arrivals are the push 

 factors. Now of course the push factors are always very big. There are millions of refugees in the world, all of 

 whom would love to come and live in Australia. The real issue is the pull factor. The way he recklessly unpicked 

 the border protection policies of the Howard Government, policies that were working, that had stopped the boats 

 - we had little or no unauthorised arrivals for years as a result of those policies. Kevin Rudd ignored the advice of 

 the Federal Police, ignored the advice of the Opposition, ignored the advice of the International Organisation on 

 Migration, ignored the advice from the Indonesian Government and now we have overnight the Sri Lankan 

 Ambassador to the United Nations saying himself that it is the pull factors, the attractiveness of Australia by 

 reason of the change in domestic policies, that is causing this surge in arrivals. Kevin Rudd has to get fair 

 dinkum. He’s got to tell us exactly what he is offering these people in order to save his face.  

 QUESTION:  

 Mr Turnbull, back on the issue of water. Just two days ago the New South Wales Government actually gave 

 councils along the Murray River permission to ease town water restrictions back to level two from a higher 

 restriction. There’s one sort of sense of feeling in the community that water’s been saved so therefore we’ve got it 

 and we can spend it. I mean, what’s your thought on water conservation, is that a sensible approach?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well I’m a fanatic about water conservation and water management generally but in terms of that particular 

 decision - Sussan, you might have a better informed local view on it.  

 SUSSAN LEY:  

 Well I guess we have to remember that towns have done such a great job saving water and even if our 

 restrictions go up one level or half a level, in terms of the amount of diversions out of the system, it’s still very 

 small. The major diverters from the river are irrigated agriculture, as it should be, they’re growing food and I think 

 it’s good to reward people in the town for doing it so hard as far as their gardens are concerned. And the councils 

 are keeping a close eye on it and can always drop it back if required.  

 QUESTION:  

 Sussan, what impact are the water buybacks having in your community? Are they helping farmers get out of a 

 terrible financial situation or are they hurting the broader agriculture industry?  

 SUSSAN LEY:  

 Well in some cases of course farmers are selling their water and it’s allowing them to continue to trade to be in 

 business, and often their banks are demanding that they sell their water so they don’t really have much choice.  

 But every community person that Malcolm I will meet today, from a community perspective, will express concern. 

 It is once water leaves the district there’s no guarantee that it returns even as a temporary purchase. So the 

 answer to the problem would have been to implement our measures which were to allow these on-farm irrigation 

 efficiencies and not a dollar has been spent.  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Can I just add something to that? Under our scheme, under our plan we had money allocated for structural 

 adjustment and water purchases of a small amount but what it was designed to do was to support the overall 

 reconstruction, renovation if you like, of irrigation areas. So the idea was that we would sit down with the big 

 irrigation users, we would work out a plan with them, or they would work out a plan actually which would involve 

 piping and lining channels and on-farm efficiency measures, the whole package, and then if there were areas 

 which could not economically be part of the new and improved efficient area then they would be eligible for 

 buyback. So that you would use it as a means to support the overall vision which was our great vision, the vision 

 that Sussan and I had when we were in government, which was to produce more food and more fibre with less 

 water. That was the vision and that has just been…and it’s a magnificent vision, it’s what Australia should do. 

 We’re the driest continent on earth. And what Kevin Rudd’s doing is making this area drier just by buying the 

 water back.  

 QUESTION:  

 Malcolm, sorry to interrupt - I had to change batteries - let me just ask another question. I’m trying not to 

 monopolise it but just quickly - do you think it’s appropriate for having the asylum seekers settled within 12 

 weeks?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 As I’ve said, Kevin Rudd has to get fair dinkum with the Australian people and he has to tell us exactly what the 

 special deal is that he is offering the people on the Oceanic Viking in order to save face for himself so that they 

 will get off the boat in Indonesia.  

 Now this is sending a shocking signal - if in fact he is offering special deals, he’s sending a shocking signal 

 because you’ve got a group of people who have been refusing to get off the boat, who have been holding up this 

 vital Australian asset, maritime asset, and they’re going to be rewarded for that by being given a special deal.  

 Kevin Rudd is the Prime Minister. We have only read what’s in the press. He is the one that has to say exactly 

 what special deal he’s offering them.  

 Sussan, you’ve just been to Christmas Island. Do you want to say something more about this?  

 SUSSAN LEY:  

 Well it was apparent to me that with the immediate urgent plans to expand the detention centre, when I was there 

 it was cooking 1,100 lunches and 1,100 dinners and it was catering obviously to a huge group of people. 

 Hercules transports were coming in, flying in portables, construction huts, even tents, to house the asylum 

 seekers who are expected. So even with the throughput that is happening, which is that in 90 days or less they 

 are reaching the mainland in 90 per cent of cases, the Government is still expecting more arrivals and that really 

 does sound the alarm bells about government policy. And to see it firsthand you do clearly get that message.  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 It’s a colossal failure in policy, there’s no question about that.  

 QUESTION:  

 What would the Coalition offer to get them off the Oceanic Viking?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Look, we have asked, Sussan and I have both asked the Government for a briefing on the Oceanic Viking 

 situation and they refuse to give us one. So we only know what’s been reported in the press. We don’t have 

 anything like the information the Government has so we’re not going to provide advice to the Government about 

 what they should do in terms of the day to day management of that situation. It is a failure of policy. We all know 

 that. But if the Government is not prepared to take us into their confidence, we’re not in a position to offer 

 informed advice about the actual management of it. We don’t know anything about the people beyond what we’ve 

 read. We don’t know where they’re situated. Really it’s a complex security challenge and, as I say, the 

 Government has refused to discuss it with us.  

 QUESTION:  

 You alluded to it earlier, the state of the Australian economy at the moment. How would you describe it I guess 

 given what we’re seeing with Australian and particularly regional exporters being whacked so hard at the 

 moment?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Yeah, with the dollar? Yeah. Well the economy, overall, the economy has performed better than many people 

 were expecting a year ago. That is a consequence of the sound economic position in which we went into the 

 downturn, and that of course was as a result of 11-and-a-half years of hard work under the Coalition which left us 

 with no debt, cash at the bank, a strong economy, low unemployment, well regulated financial and banking 

 sectors, so we didn’t have the equivalent of a subprime collapse as they did in the United States. We’ve also had 

 continuing strong demand for our raw materials, exports, particularly primary exports from Asia, in particular from 

 China.  

 Now the higher dollar is obviously a challenge for exporters. One of the things that is pressing the higher dollar of 

 course is the prospect of higher interest rates and that is being driven in large measure, not entirely but in large 

 measure, by the reckless spending of the Rudd Government.  

 Let’s not forget this - right at the moment we have the extraordinary situation where the Reserve Bank is saying 

 the economy is getting stronger and they’re obviously concerned about inflation and it getting overheated and so 

 they are sending out warning after warning about the need to pull back on the monetary stimulus; in other words 

 jack up interest rates. At the same time we’ve got Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan saying spend, spend, spend. 

 They are not going to take a backward step in terms of their spending.  

 Now at the time they made the decision to borrow and spend all this money, which we cautioned them against - 

 we said they should spend less and spend it in a better targeted way - at that time Kevin Rudd said we were 

 facing the economic equivalent of a rolling national security crisis; he said we were in an economic cyclone.  

 We on the other hand, in the Coalition, were a little bit more balanced, a lot more balanced in fact. We said we’re 

 in an economic storm, we’ll get wet but we won’t sink. But Rudd claimed to be looking over the edge of a 

 bottomless abyss so he borrowed and spent a huge amount of money. Well, it turns out he was too pessimistic. 

 That’s the kindest thing I can say about it. Consequently he should be winding back on the spending but he 

 refuses to do so. So we now have the incredible situation where you’ve got the Reserve Bank with its foot on the 

 brake and the Government, Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan, with their foot on the accelerator. And that’s 

 producing a very uneven recovery…and that’s entirely due to the incompetence, economic incompetence of the 

 Government.  

 QUESTION:  

 If I could just ask you about the ETS. There are fears about Victoria’s La Trobe Valley and its future. Given it’s a 

 coal industry, is there a future for that [inaudible]?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well of course there is. Can I just say this, we are fighting very hard at the moment in good faith negotiations with 

 the Government for there to be adequate and appropriate compensation and a transition for the coal fired 

 generators. Of course the coal fired generators, the brown coal power stations are very emissions intensive. I 

 mean to give you just an idea, a snapshot of the scale of difference. We were talking with one of the brown coal 

 generators the other day who said that in Victoria they’re emitting 1.3 tonnes of CO2 for every megawatt hour, 

 brown coal and out of the average coal fired power station 0.86. But with the new gas fired plant in New South 

 Wales near Wollongong, they’re emitting about 0.3. So it’s a huge differential between the two. So we clearly 

 have to transition from highly emissions intensive generation to low emissions intensive generation. That’s got to 

 be done fairly, it’s got to be done in a way that doesn’t wreck the balance sheets of those companies and that’s 

 part of what we’re seeking to achieve in our negotiations with the Government.  

 QUESTION:  

 [Inaudible] leave job losses, do you think, in that particular area?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well there actually should be job increases because there should be new development and new power stations. 

 The work on clean coal is extremely important. There is the real opportunity in Victoria of course to make clean 

 coal work because you have got the depleted oil and gas reservoirs off the Victorian coast which are very 

 suitable for storing compressed CO2 and there is of course a project underway to do that.  

 QUESTION:  

 Just on the ETS - hasn’t the Coalition signalled that they will vote against it in the House of Reps?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well at the moment, what we’ve done in the House of Representatives is we have moved what’s called a Second 

 Reading Amendment which summarises the amendments that we’re negotiating with the Government. And so 

 the Government won’t agree to that Second Reading Agreement so we would then vote against it in the House. 

 But the real action obviously and the place where it will be amended if agreement is reached is obviously in the 

 Senate.  

 QUESTION:  

 How could that be good faith negotiations then? You said about the best intentions…  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 No, we’ve made it very clear that the negotiations are proceeding in the utmost of good faith and we’ve made it 

 very clear that we do not support the bill in its current form. That’s been well understood. What we have set out is 

 a set of amendments, depending on the extent to which they are agreed to, may enable us to support the bill but 

 we’re having those…but until such time as an agreement is reached obviously we don’t support it.  

 QUESTION:  

 Sorry, just one quick question. You said there about spending, what about political donations - 86 per cent in a 

 poll apparently support a cap on political donations - do you think it’s a good idea?  

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:  

 Well I have been a long-term advocate of reform for many years, too long I’ve been an advocate of this because 

 we haven’t had the reform yet. I would welcome comprehensive reform to campaign finance. It’s overdue and the 

 model that I proposed, where again there have been discussions with the Government about this, the model I 

 have proposed is one where there would be a cap on donations and donations would only be receivable or able 

 to be made by human beings, by individuals who are on the electoral roll as opposed to corporations and trade 

 unions. So if you’re on the electoral roll you could make a donation and you have an annual cap on that and that 

 would I think create a much more level playing field and allay a lot of concerns that people have about the current 

 arrangements.
