 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 18 December 2001  MEDIA RELEASE                          01/750

 Detention centres out of control - independent inquiry needed

 The Australian Democrats say the latest serious disturbance at the Woomera Detention Centre highlights, once again, the urgent need of an independent inquiry into the running of the centres, and the policy of mandatory detention.

 Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said this latest disturbance appears to be the most serious to date and demonstrates conclusively that the management of detention centres is completely inadequate.

 “The Democrats will continue to push for an inquiry and will be seeking to focus on the issue when the Senate resumes in February. This is an urgent situation that needs immediate attention,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “The Government has continually demonised refugees and increased the fortification of detention centres.

 “Yet, of those detained more than 80 per cent will qualify as legitimate refugees, after meeting the refugee criteria under the UN Convention, and qualify for an Australian Temporary Protection Visa,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
