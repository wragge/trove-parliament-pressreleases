 BORDER PROTECTION COMMITTEE OF SHADOW CABINET 

 The Hon Tony Abbott MP  

 Leader of the Opposition 

 The Rudd Labor Government inherited from the Coalition a robust and effective border protection system that 

 has been progressively unwound paving the way for the current crisis on our borders.  

 To ensure that a Coalition Government could respond to this crisis from day one, we have formed a Border 

 Protection Committee of the Shadow Cabinet. This Committee brings together the shadow portfolios of Foreign 

 Affairs, Defence, Attorney-General, Immigration and Citizenship and Justice, Customs and Border Protection to 

 formulate strategies that will stop the flow of illegal boat arrivals.  

 Elements of that strategy will include:   - PREVENTION of the problem by minimising the outflows from countries of origin and secondary outflows from  countries of first asylum;  

 - DISRUPTION of people smugglers and interception of boats en route to Australia, while ensuring that those 

 people in need of refugee protection are identified and assisted as early as possible;  

 - RECEPTION AND RETURN, developing appropriate reception/detention arrangements for unauthorised 

 arrivals who reach Australia, focusing on the early assessment of the refugee status of the individual, the prompt 

 removal of those who are not refugees. 

 The newly formed Committee will also focus on other important aspects of our broader border security 

 arrangements including cross border crime, including drug trafficking, gangs and other organised criminal activity; 

 capacity and organisation of our border protection enforcement agencies and defence forces; regional 

 cooperation and agreement to address border protection related issues; and protection of our fisheries and 

 pursuit and prosecution of illegal fishing.  

 An effective border protection policy requires four key elements:   a) a rigorous commitment to offshore processing;  

 b) a special visa category for unauthorised arrivals to ensure that permanent residency is not an automatic right;  

 c) close co-operation with source and transit countries; and  

 d) being prepared, under the right circumstances, to turn around the boats. 

 The Coalition is committed to pursuing policies based on these principles to ensure that Australiaâ€™s borders are 

 safe.
