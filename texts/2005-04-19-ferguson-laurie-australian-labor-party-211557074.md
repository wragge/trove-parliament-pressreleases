 MEDIA STATEMENT   

 LAURIE FERGUSON MP             SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION 

 .          FEDERAL MEMBER FOR REID   

 

 

 NAURU -  HUMANE RESPONSE NEEDED   

 “The visit of the UNHCR representative Neill Wright and the Nauruan Government’s  decision to allow access to the detention centre in Nauru to Australia media highlights the  need for a humane response to this issue”, Shadow Minister for Immigration Laurie  Ferguson stated.  

 

 “At the outset it must be emphasised that the people involved are failed asylum claimants  and that the UNHCR itself states that very few are likely to be assessed as refugees.  Equally they refuse to return to their homelands, some of which are indeed lacking  established civil protection. In the case of Iraq, the universal picture is dim. For  Afghanistan, much depends on the region and ethnicity, with 2 million Afghans having  returned”, he further stated. 

 

 “Labor says that it remains opposed to the Pacific Solution including the Nauru detention  centre. In all circumstances, the Government should release all Nauruan detainees who  are security cleared on the new Removal Pending Bridging visa.  

 There should be the additional concessions that those detainees with current  applications  for ministerial discretion should not be barred from release and that no one, once  released, should be blocked from section 48B requests, especially when this relates to a  change of circumstance in their homeland.”    

 “It is clear to the UNHCR representative, to the media and even to the Nauruan  Government that detaining people for extensive periods is unacceptable and unjustifiable.  Whether the detainees are eventually returned to their homeland, accepted as migrants  here or in other countries, or released temporarily- the harrowing mental, psychological,  and physical effects will be everlasting”, concluded Laurie Ferguson.
