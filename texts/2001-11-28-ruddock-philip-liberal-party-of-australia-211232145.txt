 HREOC Inquiry into Children in Detention

 Press Conference - 28 November 2001

 Minister: The issue you wanted to talk about is related to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission wishing to undertake an inquiry in relation to children in detention.

 My view in relation to that is quite clear that they have certain statutory obligations and they're entitled to make their own judgements as to what they wish to inquire into. The fact is that when an inquiry in undertaken we will work with those who seek to undertake the inquiry and cooperate fully.

 The Government's view in relation to children in detention is that there are some difficult matters that have to be balanced, we certainly don't wish to see children the subject of abuse in any circumstances.

 We certainly endeavour to ensure that in every appropriate way, with relevant State Authorities, we meet the special needs of children are fully addressed and it is important in relation to allegations that are often made about abuse, to recall what happened last year, when a child was alleged to have been the subject of sale for cigarettes, for sexual purposes by his father. That allegation was found to be incorrect, proven to be incorrect.

 The fact that those allegations were made had a most detrimental impact on the child and his relationship his father and the fact is that children are very often used to pursue particular claims. One of the reasons we have large numbers of unaccompanied minors in Australia is that people are desirous of getting young family members out into situations where they might be able to settle and eventually claims might be made for a migration outcome based on the conventional of rights of a child.

 Now the fact is, there have been now, three inquiries where issues in relation to children

 have been raised. We have implemented many recommendations that arose from the Flood Report, the work from the Ombudsman and I will respond more fully of the report of the Joint Standing Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which also reported separately on those matters.

 I have instituted of my own volition, it wasn't thought of by everybody else, an alternative trial to see whether or not there are alternative ways of dealing with children in detention -there is important lessons arisen in relation to that, but so far as the inquiry by Dr Sev Ozdowski is concerned, we'll work with him and certainly cooperate in relation to the issues that he wants to raise and if there are recommendations that are usefully able to be implemented we don't have a close mind in relation to those matters and we'd obviously look at those as well.

 Question: Mr Ruddock, why are they being imprisoned? People are normally imprisoned because they're a threat to society or for punishment. Are these children being punished or are they a threat, what's the reason?

 Minister: Well, nobody is being imprisoned (interrupted)…

 Question: Well they are.

 Minister: No, no they're not. No, these are not jails. They are immigration detention centres (interrupted)…

 Question: Detained, imprisoned, why are they being detained?

 Minister: Well, no they are not prisoners, they are being detained, and they are detained as all unauthorised border arrivals are detained. To first ascertain as to who they are and whether they pose risks to the Australian community. Now you say they don't pose risks. The first risk which is very obvious, is a risk to health and there are a range of other issues that have to be addressed. We don't like detaining minors but the range of minors come in a variety of circumstances, some are young, the majority are in their teens. The fact is that most of them come as part of impact family units, where the judgement of the families is that they would rather stay together.

 Question: What about the 53 children that don't have parents and after they have been held for a month - a couple of months and they're ascertained as no one helps them - what's holding (inaudible).

 Minister: Well if they are ascertained to have asylum claims they are released into the community under the supervision of the relevant - I am the guardian - but under the supervision of the

 relevant state welfare authorities, in most circumstances into foster arrangements. Others who are found not to be refugees might continue to be detained until we are able to make satisfactory arrangements to reunite them with their families and it very much depends, we look at each of these situations on a case by case basis.

 Question: …given there have been several reports into this its an ongoing problem that been going on for some time and the human rights watchdog feels it needs to become involved again -what does that say about the pace of reform and proceedings?

 Minister: Well it suggests that the human rights watchdog as you call it, sees a role for itself in relation to these matters I simply make the point that there may well have been other matters worthy of examination that have not been the subject of three reports in 18 months.

 Question: Have you seen the terms of reference yet Mr Ruddock?

 Minister: Yes, I have seen the terms of reference yesterday.

 Question: What did you think of them?

 Minister: They looked quite comprehensive. I was pleased that in the body of the document the Human Rights Commissioner recognised the importance of maintaining the family units intact and that is a principle in the convention on the rights of the child.

 The issue here is that numbers of people believe that if you accept that principle and you can also argue that children ought not to be detained, that unauthorised arrivals could be released into the community without the issues that need to be addressed being addressed, simply because they bought children with them. I say, and have said over a long period of time, that the convention - the obligations under the Convention of the Rights of the Child are recognised, are accepted, but they don't require us to release people who would otherwise be the subject of detention to satisfy whether or not they have proper claims to be here - to satisfy identification, to satisfy the protection needs of the Australian community -ought to be available once processed for removal.

 Those matters can't be compromised and they are difficult issues, but there has to be a balance. We think we have got the balance right, and while recommendations that might suggest that particular issues of education, of amenity, if they can be reasonably addressed will be addressed. In terms of undermining or unwinding the mandatory detention arrangements for people who are unauthorised border arrivals we will not allow that to occur, we believe the arrangements we have in place meet our international obligations and will continue to be accepted.

 Question: Mr Ruddock, the 550 or so people on Christmas Island - what's going to happen about

 them? When will you be making the decision about whether they will be moved, whether they're proceeding? What's going to happen?

 Minister: Well it has always been the case that we will make a decision when we are ready to do so. There are a range of issues that we are addressing and they are being addressed. In terms of their access to Australia our position remains as it was during the election campaign and before. Our intention is to ensure that people who come to Australia clandestinely will not reach the Australian mainland by that method.

 Question: But these ones aren't being processed, either way are they (inaudible). So at the moment they're waiting?

 Minister: There are certain interviews that are being undertaken by way of a preliminary nature but the issue of where they are ultimately processed is a matter about which a decision will be taken.

 Question: What's the timeframe - who are you talking to? What are the options?

 Minister: Well the timeframe is ours - I mean I'm not going to be held to an arbitrary timeframe where essentially the demands that are placed upon us arise from the fact that people have been unauthorised border arrivals. They don't set the timeframe.

 Question: They could be there a month, six months, a year….

 Minister: They could be there as long as required….

 Question: And the temporary facilities, will that be kept on?

 Minister: Well the facility at the moment, lends itself to keeping people on a temporary basis, because it had to be erected at some speed, but, that is an issue which will also address in terms of the longer term arrangements. But I make the point, there is no time frame that can be set for us, in relation to people who are unauthorised border arrivals…..we face…..

 Question:… (inaudible) anywhere to send them?

 Minister: No the problem is that you have people who have come, without authority, and where there is a requirement for mandatory detention, we determine the circumstances about which people will enter Australia, the Parliament has outlined the legal framework, which operates, and the fact that more people come than you might have expected at particular

 points in time is not a matter that forces us to change the policies we have in relation to mandatory detention, or in relation to processing.

 Question:… Border Protection Legislation, are you a hundred percent happy with it, are there any slight modifications you might be looking at when Parliament resumes?

 Minister: I have no proposals at this stage in relation to the legislation, but that's not to say that in relation to legislation, that given the dynamic nature of the areas in which we are dealing with, there are decisions of the court that prompt us to have to look again at aspects of it, we'll want to do that, but at the moment there are no proposals.

 Question: Has the Government given any further consideration on donating patrol boats or helping build new facilities in Indonesia…discuss those…

 Minister: I think the only point I'd make in relation those matters, is that there will be discussions and it's best those discussions take their course.

 Question: Do you feel that the lines of communication are now fully open with Indonesia on the issue of people smugglers?

 Minister: Well, the point I would make in relation to our relationship with countries in the region and countries of first asylum, the lines of communication have always been open, and we've always had a high level of cooperation, that doesn't mean to say that there aren't further things which can be done, or that you don't review the way in which you approach these matters, you obviously do. If you go back and look at what I've had to say over a long period of time, you'll find that I have been a person who has frequently….averted to the high level of cooperation we've been receiving from Indonesia and the difficulties that they experience in having to manage their borders, the entry of people into their country, and one of the reasons we made significant changes to our law here domestically was as a result of the sorts of observations we've had from Indonesia, that we needed to ensure that we weren't an attractive destination for people who might transit there

 Question: Mr Ruddock will you be providing full cooperation to the Human Rights Commissioner, full access to detention centres, and that sort of thing?

 Minister: I've indicated initially that we will continue to work cooperatively with Human Rights….

 Question: Does that include full access to children being held in the detention centres?

 Minister:

 I don't think there is any doubt about that, I'm surprised in the way you in which you pressed the question, cooperation is cooperation, they have their statutory obligations, and Dr Ozdowski is someone I know, and known over a long period of time, and we will work with him, he has his job to do, we have ours.

 Question: … are you likely to take note of that?

 Minister: Pardon?

 Question: If he recommends that children can be released, would you change your mind on that issue?

 Minister: Now look, I mean the question of mandatory detention is dealt with by statue and it's part of our law, its within our human rights obligations, there are many who would like to see it unwound, I know that, I'm not oblivious to it, but to unwind it, would enable more children to be used by those intent on achieving migration outcomes, and getting outcomes to which they might not otherwise be entitled.

 Question: What about the trial release in Woomera of women and children? What's your assessment of that and can that be expanded at all?

 Minister: Well, the assessment I have at the moment is that it has been working well, I said it would be a trial and I'll get a full report on how it has been working, numbers of women and children that have been through it and there are elements of culture in relation to this, there are some family groups that are prepared to separate, the spouse and children live independently in the community for a time where they can closely visit their partner in a detention centre, there are others who are not prepared to do that. It does provide a degree of flexibility, it appears to be working well, but I will await the full report on it. Thanks very much.
