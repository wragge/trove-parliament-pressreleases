 Coalition Propaganda Campaign Begins Kim Beazley - Leader of the Opposition

 Media Statement - 4 September 2001

 Coalition MPs appear to have wasted no time with a propaganda campaign aimed at deliberately distorting and inflaming the issue of illegal boat arrivals.

 Minister Mal Brough sent a letter to his constituents in Longman last Friday trying to incite antagonism towards people "from Middle East destinations", and misrepresenting the intentions of his own Government, as well as the Labor Party.

 In his letter, Mr Brough attacks the Labor Party and the Democrats for refusing to support the Government's Border Protection Bill.

 His letter neglected to point out that the Prime Minister said he did not need the legislation, or that the Labor Party offered last week to negotiate with the Government to produce legislation to deal specifically with the MV Tampa, but the Government refused.

 Mr Brough writes: "The Government's intention is to remove MV Tampa from Australian waters, and should other vessels attempt similar incursions, they too could be physically removed…"

 As we now know, having recognised the need for the people on the ship to have somewhere safe to go, the Government did not attempt at any time to "remove MV Tampa from Australian waters" with the passengers still on board.

 The Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, said in a press statement yesterday: "It was never the case that Australia would somehow force these people back to face inhumane treatment in their country of origin where they are able to prove that they are genuine refugees…..Various nations, including Australia, will fairly share the task of resettling those with a genuine need for a safe haven."

 Over the weekend, Mr Howard acknowledged that those people assessed to be refugees "will have, in accordance with the normal procedures, access to Australia."

 Mr Howard also said…"nobody should think that because of that increased surveillance we are going to stop all boats coming to Australia."

 I call on Mr Brough and any other Coalition MP engaging in divisive and inflammatory propaganda to correct their material so that it conforms with the statements of their leaders, and so that it accurately

 reflects the principled stand and co-operative approach taken by the Labor Party in Federal Parliament last week. Authorised by Geoff Walsh, 19 National Circuit, Barton ACT 2600.
