 South Australians unite to celebrate Refugee  Week 2013  Thursday, 20 June 2013 

 South Australians will join together to celebrate the contribution of refugees to  Australian communities as part of World Refugee Day 2013 today. 

 Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Brendan O'Connor, and Minister for  Multicultural Affairs, Senator Kate Lundy, said as well as marking the rich diversity of  refugee communities around the country, there is an extra occasion to celebrate,  with the settlement of 800 000 refugees and humanitarian entrants in Australia since  World War II. 

 Refugee Week, which coincides with World Refugee Day on June 20, has been  celebrated in Australia since the 1980s and in South Australia a wide range of  community events and activities are planned in celebration. 

 Mr O'Connor said the week's celebration - from June 16-22 - was a unique  opportunity to recognise the plight of refugees around the world and acknowledge  the contribution made by government and non-government organisations to assist  refugees to contribute to Australian society. 

 'Australia has a long and proud history as a refugee resettlement country and a  cooperative international partner, which is demonstrated by the settlement of 800  000 refugee and humanitarian entrants under the humanitarian program,' Mr  O'Connor said. 

 'The Gillard government is committed to ensuring that people settling here have the  help they need to rebuild their lives and become active participants in the  community, and this week is an important time not only to recognise this  commitment, but also the diversity which has grown through the humanitarian  program.' 

 Senator Lundy said Australia's resettlement tradition was integral to providing new  opportunities for those in humanitarian need. 

 'The contributions of people who have been settled under Australia's humanitarian  program are enormous in both economic and social spheres, and this week is an  important occasion to pause and reflect on the amazing impact these entrants have  had in carving Australia's identity.' 

 Australia's contribution to international protection and humanitarian efforts continues  this year, with 20 000 people to be welcomed through the humanitarian program in  2013-14.
