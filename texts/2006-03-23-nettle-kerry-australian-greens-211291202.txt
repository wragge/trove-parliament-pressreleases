 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales 

 

 

 West Papuans deserve permanent protection   Senator Nettle, 23rd March 2006   

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle has welcomed the award of protection visas to the West  Papuan refugees who have been on Christmas Island, but questioned the temporary  status of the visas.    

 "The situation in West Papua is clearly very dangerous for those who assert their right  to self-determination, so the decision to grant protection visas is a good one," Senator  Nettle said.    

 "There is no reason why these refugees cannot be granted full protection and as a  result full rights to live and work in the Australian community,    

 "I look forward to meeting again the West Papuans when they are settled on the  mainland.    

 "I hope this decision indicates a acknowledgement by the Australian government that  the situation in West Papua is a human rights nightmare.    

 "I shall be asking the government about the foreign policy implications of the decision  with regards to the ongoing human rights abuses in West Papua.    

 "Its illogical for the Australian Government to continue to support the conditions  which lead to the oppression of West Papuans in their country whilst also  acknowledging this oppression with these protection visas.    

 "The decision made today allows these refugees to live in the community whilst their  claim for asylum is monitored which should have been the case from the moment they  landed on Australian soil.
