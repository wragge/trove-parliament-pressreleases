 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Monday, 23 September 2013    

 Hiding the boats from the Australian public won’t  stop them arriving: Greens    

 The Australian Greens are calling on the Coalition government to be open with the  Australian public on its border protection policy and to treat Indonesia with respect in  enacting those policies.     

 “It is naÃ¯ve of Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison to think Australians living on Christmas  Island will stay quiet when a boatload of asylum seekers arrives with a military escort,”  Greens immigration spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “Weekly media briefings on boat arrivals will only lead the public into taking up the  minister’s role by informing the media themselves. Minister Morrison can refuse to  confirm boat arrivals all he likes, but it doesn’t mean they’ll stop coming, as eight boats  have done since the election.      

 “Indonesia seems to be the last to find out about the Government’s border protection  plans. To Indonesia’s surprise, Tony Abbott intends to set up ‘transit ports’ to ensure that  no-one makes it into Australian waters.     

 “This is a clear violation of international law and puts into question the country’s  sovereignty.  Sidelining the Indonesian Government does nothing to further relations and  is quite simply disrespectful.     

 “Tony Abbot’s cruel and hard-line approach to refugees threatens ongoing relations with  Indonesia. We need to work with Indonesia and other countries in our region, not against  them.    

 “Whilst the Government tries to pull the wool over the public’s eyes, the Greens will  continue to stand up for vulnerable refugees seeking Australia’s protection and work with  our neighbours to find a humane, regional response.”
