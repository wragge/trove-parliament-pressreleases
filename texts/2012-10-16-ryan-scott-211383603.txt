 Labor caught cooking the books on illegal boat budget 

 Labor’s shambolic border protection approach has seen budget assumptions blown out of the water,  according to David Tune, secretary of the Department of Finance and Deregulation.   

 Responding to questioning by Senator Scott Ryan in the Senate Finance and Public Administration  Committee, Mr Tune said his department, together with the Department of Immigration and  Citizenship, had developed a way of calculating the cost of boat arrivals.   

 However, with the massive influx of arrivals since the Labor Government’s dismantling of successful  Coalition policies, the funding model has fallen over.   

 Asked whether the department’s assumptions about the cost of boat arrivals had been useful, Mr  Tune replied: “I’d say we haven’t been all that close to the mark. There’s been constant upward  movements.” 

 Pushed by Senator Ryan as to whether the Department of Finance and Deregulation had  underestimated the asylum seeker blow-out, Mr Tune replied “I think it’s fair to say”.   

 Senator Ryan, deputy chair of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee, said “Mr  Tune’s refreshing honesty has confirmed what we’ve known all along: Labor’s asylum seeker failures  are having a serious impact on the budget bottom line."    

 “We will have to wait until MYEFO to see just how much more Julia Gillard and Chris Bowen’s failed  asylum seeker policies have cost,” Senator Ryan said.   

 In 2012, so far 12,544 asylum seekers have arrived on our shores, an average of over 1,300 boat  arrivals per month. 

 A quarter of the way through the 2012-13 year, more people had arrived on illegal boats than the  Gillard Government had budgeted for the entire financial year. 

 “The Coalition has a tried and tested policy to stop the boats: offshore processing, temporary  protection visas and turning back the boats when it is safe to do so,” Senator Ryan said.

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 Mr Tune, in terms of the expenses relating to our migration and humanitarian migration  programmes, do you have a funding model that allows you to calculate what the impact of an  increase in the number of unlawful arrivals, or an increase in the size of the humanitarian intake? 

 DAVID TUNE: 

 We do. Well, we don’t have it but DIAC has it - the Department of Immigration has that.  

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 I think they’ve pointed us towards you, Mr Tune.   

 DAVID TUNE: 

 Yeah well I was just about to go on. We work closely with them in that so I guess you’d call it  a joint  model in that sense and we have to agree the numbers that go into the budget papers. So yes, there  is a sort of a model, yeah, I suppose it’s a model, yeah, I’d call it that. 

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 Could we call it a rule of thumb, as you might have referred to earlier, or is it more complex than  that? 

 DAVID TUNE: 

 It’s probably halfway between a rule of thumb and a model. If I, I don’t know… 

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 Alright, I’ll take you on that. So what are the details of the model?   

 DAVID TUNE: 

 Ok. The model tries to take account of arrivals, what happens to them in terms of costs per unit,  depending on where they are located. 

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 Can I interrupt here for a second? In terms of costs per unit, is that based on…   

 DAVID TUNE: 

 Costs per person. Yes, we try to track them through the numbers of arrivals… 

 

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 Can you pinpoint where they arrive or where they’re taken to after they arrive? 

 DAVID TUNE: 

 Yeah, yeah, where they arrive, where they are taken to. As you know, some go into detention  centres, some go into the community under current policy. Some will be going or currently are going  to Nauru. Some will go there on a more permanent basis, plus Manus. So you’re try and differentiate  in all those things. 

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 And you have a different cost for each of those arrivals and placements? Broadly?   

 DAVID TUNE: 

 Yes, broadly. And you’re looking at period, period of time in detention. 

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 Do you make assumptions about that?   

 DAVID TUNE: 

 Yes, we have to. Yeah, so you’re trying to build the thing up in a way that gets you to a bottom line. 

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 And so in terms of your assumptions, do you make assumptions about numbers, for future costing?   

 DAVID TUNE: 

 Yes we do, yep. 

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 So what are your assumptions, well, how have your assumptions changed over the course of recent  years? I mean, how much have you uplifted? Presumably you’ve uplifted the -  

 DAVID TUNE: 

 Yeah, we have. 

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 How close have you been to the mark, in terms of numbers?   

 DAVID TUNE: 

 I’d say we haven’t been all that close to the mark. There’s been constant upward movements. 

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 So you’ve underestimated? 

 DAVID TUNE: 

 Yeah I think so. Yeah, I think it’s fair to say. 

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 Does your model include costs for other levels of government? I’m particularly talking about state  governments, if they were providing support services. It’s only a cost to the Commonwealth budget? 

 DAVID TUNE: 

 Correct. 

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 Do you have a cost for numbers arriving under the humanitarian programme? Because they…  presumably they have access to particular services, so… 

 DAVID TUNE: 

 Yes. Yes, we cost that as well. 

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 And is that a flatter cost so to speak because we effectively choose who comes here, bring them  here, resettle them or does that vary as much as the other for unlawful arrivals?  

 DAVID TUNE: 

 Because you know the number, that makes a big difference. So it’s the less - more certain base  number and you have a pretty good idea of what the unit per cost per person coming in here is  based on history. So it’s much easier to do. 

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 Until recently though, the longstanding situation’s been the number of people arriving unlawfully  does come off the number of people who choose to resettle.  

 DAVID TUNE: 

 The Government - sorry I might be talking about cross purposes. I was assuming you were talking  about the humanitarian programme that the Government’s announced. 

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 Sure. 

 DAVID TUNE: 

 Recently announced increase in that. We costed the difference in cost from the previous number to  the current number. That’s been announced by the Government. So that’s an agreed cost. So we can  do that and as I said, that’s a more certain number. 

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 So if I - I’m not sure if I want to, but if I chose, you have numbers around and assumptions around if  someone arrive at a particular place, how long they may spend in detention depending on where  they are sent if they are sent anywhere or not placed in community detention. In the end we’ve got  to start putting a number on some of this for the purposes of the model.  

 DAVID TUNE: 

 Yes we do. The model incorporates that, yep. 

 SCOTT RYAN: 

 Ok and that number, if I could just - someone arrives on say Christmas Island and there might be a  group of people. Some are brought to the mainland and after a period of process in community  detention, that might be one particular number and the cost to the Commonwealth. Someone else is  maintained in detention on Christmas Island or on the mainland - that would be a different set of  numbers. Someone sent to Nauru or Manus Island - that would be different numbers and within  there, there would be assumptions around length of period in detention. 

 DAVID TUNE: 

 Correct.
