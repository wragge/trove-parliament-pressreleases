 COALITION REFUSES TO DISMANTLE INTEGRITY MEASURES IN DETENTION REGIME   

 “The Coalition will not support the Rudd Government’s latest attempt to further weaken the  integrity of Australia’s migration programs”, Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship, Dr Sharman Stone said today.   

 “Abolishing detention debt does not change the current practice and policy at all. Those  detainees found to be refugees have long had their debt waived or written off. In fact, 95%  of all detainees have this experience. However, abolishing the principle would be seen by  people smugglers as one more piece of evidence of this government going soft on border  protection.   

 “The Coalition has always been committed to an orderly and humanely managed  immigration and refugee program and we will continue to ensure that Australia remains one  of the most generous providers of humanitarian resettlement in the world. However we will  do this in a way that does not encourage unauthorised arrivals and the barbaric practice of  people smuggling.   

 “The Rudd Labor Government has unravelled the measures which previously kept our  borders secure. This includes abolishing TPV’s, the 45-day rule which says you must apply  for a protection visa within 45 days of arrival in Australia and the proposed creation of  another catch-all protection visa for those who are not eligible for refugee protection under  UNHCR rules.   

 “There are safeguards in the legislation to ensure asylum seekers who do not have the  means to pay are given manageable repayment schedules, or have their detention debts  waived or written off.    

 “If this program is poorly administered, then administrative arrangements wshould be  improved. The principle cannot be destroyed.
