 MEDIA RELEASE 

 TIME TO ‘TURN OFF THE TAP’ 

 Revelations today that four asylum seekers who received a special deal from the Rudd Government  have been identified as a national security risk show that the current surge of boat arrivals must be  brought to an end. 

 Liberal Senator Gary Humphries is today renewing the call for the Federal Government to send a  clear message to people smugglers that piling people onto boats will in future be a futile tactic. 

 “The wider problem here is that, in August 2008, Labor sent a clear message overseas that if you  jump on a boat to Australia your chances of winning the right to live here improved,” said Senator  Humphries. 

 “We have now seen more than 3,000 people come to our shores since then; Christmas Island is full to  overflowing and the Government is still trying to play ‘happy families’. 

 “Since the special deal has been done with the 78 asylum seekers on the Oceanic Viking, we have  seen boat after boat being intercepted. 

 “I call on the Government once again to take immediate action to stop the trend - to stop people  risking their lives on these boats and to stop encouraging them by offering them special deals,”  Senator Humphries concluded.
