 ADDRESS BY SIR WILLIAM DEANE

 GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA 

 ON THE OCCASION OF THE OPENING OF THE 

 RAHULA COMMUNITY LODGE 

 CANBERRA

 SUNDAY. 8 FEBRUARY 1998

 It is a great pleasure for Helen and me to be with you this morning, for the  Official Opening o f the first three buildings o f the Rahula Community Lodge, here at  the Sakyamuni Buddhist Centre

 This is the first time that we have had the privilege o f visiting the Centre -  the  first and certainly the largest o f the Buddhist institutions in Canberra It is also the  largest Buddhist Welfare Centre in Australia It gives me the opportunity to  acknowledge the great contribution the Centre is making to the spirit o f diversity and  true multiculturaiism in the ACT and surrounding region

 As I read them, the most recent census figures put the number o f Buddhists in  Canberra at around 4000 people That is a significant proportion o f the overall  population. Yet the Chief Abbot, the Venerable Thich Quang Ba, tells me he  believes the true figure is possibly closer to 6000 people Certainly the large crowds  which attended the festivities here late last month to mark the beginning o f the New 

 Year -  the Year o f the Tiger -  with joy, feasting and fireworks were a very good  indication o f the strength and enthusiasm o f the Buddhist community in the Capital  Territory.

 A report from the Bureau o f Immigration, Multicultural and Population  Research a couple o f years ago, showed that over the 10 years to 1991  Buddhism was  by far the largest growing religion in our country an increase in the order o f 300%,  although from a relatively small base To a significant extent, o f course, the figures  reflect the substantial increase in migration from south-east Asia over that period -  most notably by people from Vietnam who accounted for more than a third o f all  Buddhists. But the second largest national group were Australian-born Buddhists -  many from non-Asian cultures attracted by both the philosophy and the practice o f 

 Buddhism with its emphasis upon the search for inner peace and understanding

 The United Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation o f Canberra was established  by a small group o f Indo-Chinese refugees early in 1983 Later that year, the  Venerable Thich Quang Ba was invited by the group to become President, and he has

 2

 remained, to become founder and Chief Abbot o f the Van Hanh monastery and  director o f the Sakyamuni Buddhist Centre

 The plans for this complex go back to those early days It was in 1986 that  the then Department o f Territories granted this land to the Congregation, and the  monastery -  the first stage o f the Centre -  was built and opened in 1989. Five years  later a number o f beautiful monuments on the site were built and dedicated as the  second stage o f the project. Today we come to the third stage the opening o f the  first three o f what eventually w ill be five residential blocks for low-income people  within the Rahula Community Lodge There will be 28 people housed here initially:  people from many backgrounds and cultures, not necessarily from the Buddhist  tradition Each resident will have his or her separate room, with communal cooking,  washing and laundry facilities. The separate cafeteria -  the Karima House -  that we  see, will be open not only to residents but also to the public generally. The  architecture o f the Centre, particularly the more gently curving roof line, clearly  reflects the Vietnamese influences which have contributed so much to the  establishment and development o f the local Congregation

 The Sakyamuni Buddhist Centre is making and will continue to make a most  significant contribution to our religious and cultural diversity Among the  considerable range o f welfare programs with which the Centre is associated, let me  mention briefly the visits to correctional and juvenile centres, the joint activities being  undertaken with organisations such as Red Cross, the Council o f the Ageing, the  Cancer Society, the Ethnic Communities Council, Community Aid Abroad, the  Community Refuge Settlement Scheme, Interfaith groups, and so on. In all o f this,  the Sakyamuni Buddhist Centre is making a profoundly important practical and moral  contribution to that sense o f mutual understanding, toleration and respect which is  such a fundamental aspect o f our Australian multiculturalism

 In short, the Sakyamuni Buddhist Centreâ€™s contribution to the moral, religious,  cultural and social enrichment o f the people o f Canberra and the surrounding district  has been a profoundly important one. It w ill be enhanced with the opening and  occupation o f these new residential blocks I congratulate the Centre on all that has  been achieved over the past 15 years I offer my very best wishes for the success o f  all that you hope to achieve in the years ahead as future stages o f the Centre are  completed the proposed school for lay people and clergy, the library, the pagoda,  the facilities for both young people and the elderly May all your endeavours prosper  and bring joy to those whom they are intended to help

 Finally, I offer my sincere congratulations to all those who have been  associated with the planning, design and construction o f the project

 And now, with the greatest o f pleasure, I officially declare open the Rahula  Community Lodge for the Sakyamuni Buddhist Centre
