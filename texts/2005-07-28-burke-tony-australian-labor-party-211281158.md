 MEDIA RELEASE

 Member for Watson            Shadow Minister for Immigration

 FEDERAL COURT RIGHT TO PUT ONUS ON FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT   

 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration, Tony Burke today called on the Howard Government  to rule out appealing a Federal Court decision that the Government must prove it is safe  for asylum seekers whose temporary protection visas had expired to return home.   

 “The Federal Court has given a clear endorsement of Labor’s approach.  When a period  of temporary protection has expired, it should be up to the Government to prove that it is  safe for the person to return,” said Mr Burke.   

 “The experience of both Afghanistan and Iraq has shown that a period of military conflict  doesn’t immediately turn a land of persecution into a safe haven.   

 “It’s not good enough for a Government to have a policy of deporting refugees into  danger.    

 “If the Government believes it is safe for people to return home, it should have to  establish a case to prove this.”
