 More blowouts on the way: illegal boat arrivals already above financial year estimate  

 10/11/10  

 Taxpayers should brace for further budget blow outs to pay for Labor’s failed border protection  policies, with more people having arrived illegally by boat so far this financial year than the  government projected would arrive by the end of next June, Shadow Minister for Productivity and  Population & Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today. 

 “In the May budget the government allocated $327.5 million for offshore asylum seeker  management(1) but the funds were based on only 2,000 people illegally arriving by boat this  financial year(2). A little more than four months into this financial year and already 2,320 people  have arrived,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “With detention delays increasing and boats coming on an almost daily basis under Minister  Bowen’s watch, the estimate of $327.5 million for offshore asylum seeker management is under  extreme pressure and taxpayers should brace themselves for further cost explosions,” he said. 

 “Forward years for 2011/12 and 2012/13 should also be revised to reflect Labor's detention crisis.  The suggestion in the current forward estimates that asylum seeker costs will more than halve next  financial year, from current budgeted levels, is as ridiculous as it is fiscally irresponsible. 

 “The budget does not reflect a true indication of the likely costs. Further blowouts are a certainty. 

 “The release of MYEFO confirmed that taxpayers will be forced to fork out an extra $55 million, as  part of Labor’s $170 million immigration detention centre construction program, on the Inverbrackie  and Northam centres, both of which will rapidly fill with boat arrivals. 

 “MYEFO also shows yet another immigration blow out - $11 million for Labor’s independent merits  review of refugee decisions for failed asylum seekers who arrive by boat. This review continues to  delay final assessments and further clogs an already stressed detention system. 

 “The farce of the Prime Minister’s East Timor plan continues by the day. Its absence from the pages  of MYEFO is yet another reminder that this is a never never ‘solution’,” he said.
