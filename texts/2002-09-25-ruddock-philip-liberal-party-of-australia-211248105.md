 First Decisions on East Timorese Protection Visa Applicants MPS 087/2002

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today announced that the first decisions for East Timorese protection visa applicants have been handed down.

 This follows the announcement in March this year that decision-making on some 1700 East Timorese cases would be resumed.

 The first group of decisions covering 168 people is being handed down today, with no-one receiving approval. Processing of the remaining applicants is continuing and these decisions are expected to be handed down shortly.

 As part of the March announcement, all applicants were invited to provide further information in support of their applications before any decision was made.

 Consequently, the applicants who received their decision this week have had the opportunity to provide this information.

 Applications were assessed on a case-by-case basis and the outcome of future decisions will continue to depend upon the circumstances of the individual case.

 East Timorese people who have applications under consideration will be able to remain in Australia until their applications are finally determined. If they are approved, they will be granted a protection visa.

 If their applications are refused, they will have access to review of these decisions.

 However, it is reasonable to expect people who are found not be refugees and so do not have a well-founded fear of persecution, to return home when their country is safe and secure.

 In any event, the resolution of these applications allows these asylum seekers to move on with their lives.
