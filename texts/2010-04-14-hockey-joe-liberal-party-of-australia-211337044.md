 DOORSTOP INTERVIEW BRISBANE 2PM WEDNESDAY 14 APRIL 2010 

 

 14TH APRIL 2010 

 

 Subject: Interest rates, increasing cigarette tax, health reform, population growth  

 E&OE……………………………………………………………………………………… 

 JOURNALIST: 

 Mr Hockey, a series of interest rate rises and a campaign from the Opposition against them, but the consumer  confidence figures released this morning shows only a 0.8% fall. Do you think your campaign about interest rates  is failing?  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 I would say this on interest rates - interest rates have risen by more than the cash rate from the Reserve Bank.   Even the Reserve Bank has said that the banks have passed on higher increases than the cash rate changes  from the Reserve Bank.   

 Small business in particular has not received the full benefit of the cuts of the past, but is paying a very heavy  price for the increases going ahead. The costs that are going through to small business in particular with higher  interest rates will, over time, have an impact, a dramatic impact on business activity in Australia.  

 For those people with a mortgage, I would say they know what the real cost of the increase in interest rates is,  but it is now coupled with significant increases in electricity, water, education, health and day-to-day food  expenses.  

 I would say to anyone who thinks that increases in interest rates don’t matter, go and ask people who are facing  a higher cost of living. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 Is it still Coalition policy to hike taxes on cigarettes? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 We had a very specific proposal last year in relation to private health insurance.  If we are going to have a serious  discussion about tax, now is the time for the government to release the Henry Review.  

 The government has an $18 billion hole in its health program and it’s refusing to release a review that will explain  to Australians how they are going to end up paying under Kevin Rudd, higher taxes and perhaps even new taxes  for his spending.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 In theory, do you support a hike in cigarette taxes to pay for Rudd’s health plan? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 We want to see the Henry Review.  Kevin Rudd cannot continue to play this game with the Australian people of  not coming clean on what taxes he’s going to increase and when.  

 It is now time to see the real impact of Kevin Rudd’s policies. It’s time to release the Henry Review and be fair  dinkum with the Australian people about the real tax increases that are planned.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 What’s going to happen at COAG? 

 JOE HOCKEY:  

 Crystal ball, I don’t know. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 What do you think about John Brumby’s plan? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 Well John Brumby is proving to be a man of courage.  He’s proving to be a man of courage because he’s  standing up for what’s best for the people of Victoria.  I’d like to see other Premiers put their hand on their heart  and say that they’re putting the interests of their State first, rather than putting Kevin Rudd’s political interests  first. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 Will the Coalition oppose Mr Rudd’s health and hospitals plan if they don’t detail precisely where the funding’s  going to come from?  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 No the government has to outline all of the details.  It has to deliver all of the details of its health plan. How can  we just put up our hands and support something that is half-baked, that has been half-released and that is  unfunded.  How can we do that?  

 It is irresponsible for any legislator to support a program that is not detailed, that has huge unexplained costs and  that is going to lead to higher taxes without a proper explanation.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 What about the Opposition’s health policy, when will we see that?  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 It will be a very good policy when you see it. Trust me. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 When we will see an alternative? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 I’ll tell you what, the problem we face at the moment is that the field is moving.  If Kevin Rudd does succeed in  having a reshaping of the health system, then clearly our policies will need to respond to that.  But if Kevin Rudd  continues down this path of delivering a half-baked policy on health, then we will have to have policies that  respond to that as well.  

 What is happening is that the playing field and the rules of the game are changing in health, so it would be wholly  irresponisble to deliver a comprehensive policy in the environment we’re in at the moment. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 Kokoda, Kilamanjoro - what have you got lined up for next year?  

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 It’s a cracker, but I’d better share it with my wife first. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 No clues - doesn’t start with a K? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 It’s cold. That’s a C. 

 JOURNALIST: 

 Population growth and the economy. Is growth a pro?  What are your thoughts on that? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 The debate about population has to be about sustainability.   About quality of life, not about a particular number.  We need to grow our population to continue to grow, that is inevitable. We need to continue to have ‘one for  Australia’ and we need to continue to have a robust immigration program.  

 But most important of all, we need to ensure that if we increase our population that the people living in Australia  in the future do not have a lesser quality of life than that which we have today. We owe it to the future to ensure  that population growth is sustainable and does not diminish the quality of life we hand to our children.  

 JOURNALIST: 

 Is that difficult for you to say as the son of a migrant? 

 JOE HOCKEY: 

 I’m not saying stop migration, nor am I saying stop a refugee program.  I’ve always supported a reasonable and  fair immigration program.  It is hugely important for the fabric of our nation.  It’s hugely important for the growth of  our nation. But what matters is that we deliver a quality of life that is no less than that which we have today.  That’s what matters.
