 MEDIA RELEASE 

 25 July 2012 

 A SMALL STEP TOWARDS ACTION ON ASYLUM SEEKERS, SAYS OAKESHOTT   

 THE Cross-Party Working Group on Refugees took a small but important step this week  when its focus moved to people, not boats, said Independent Lyne MP Rob Oakeshott. 

 “At a glance, the group’s public statement [attached] might not seem like much but what it  does do is place the focus on the regional nature of a response,” Mr Oakeshott said. 

 “This is quite an important first step in finding common ground. 

 "Further work needs to occur to define what a regional response would look like, and I am  obviously on the record pointing to the principles of the Bali Process as the foundation  blocks of any agreement.   

 “That said, I respect the different constituencies of different political parties, and the need  for all issues of border protection and human rights to be considered. 

 "Hopefully, we can make further progress towards an agreement at the next working group  meeting on August 6. 

 “I also look forward to the spectrum of issues - stopping the deaths at sea, minimising the  movement of people within our region and tackling the trafficking and smuggling business  model - being priority issues for the Parliament when it resumes in mid-August.  

 “Australians want the Parliament to resolve this issue, and soon.”
