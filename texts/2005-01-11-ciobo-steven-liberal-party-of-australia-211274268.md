 Federal MP Steven Ciobo has given local  community groups a final reminder about the  latest round of Commonwealth funding available  to assist refugees, humanitarian entrants and  migrants to settle in Australia.    

 Mr Ciobo today reminded community groups that  applications for funding under the Howard  Government’s Community Settlement Services  Scheme must be received before this Friday (14  January).    

 “The Gold Coast is a culturally diverse city that  has grown from the strong contribution made by  people from many different cultures,” Mr Ciobo  said.    

 “New settlers to our city often rely on the invaluable support from organisations in the community  that provide a range of migrant services.    

 “Settlement programs contribute enormously to the successful adjustment of people who seek to  make Australia their home, by assisting them to become full and active participants in the local  democratic society.    

 “Local settlement services help migrants and humanitarian entrants adjust to life on the Coast so they  achieve independence,” he said.    

 The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) has allocated  $14.5 million for the Community Settlement Services Scheme to help people settle quickly and  effectively into the local community.    

 Mr Ciobo said the funding was part of a $29 million package offered under DIMIA’s migrant  settlement services.    

 “Projects should help newly arrived migrants to access mainstream services on the Coast and  participate in our local community,” Mr Ciobo said.    

 “Recent arrivals need prompt access to settlement planning and service delivery networks.    

 “Projects that help migrant communities to organise, plan and advocate for their own needs will be  given funding priority,” Mr Ciobo said.    

 Organisations that would like to apply for Community Settlement Services Scheme funding should  contact the Office of Steven Ciobo on 5591 1011 for more information.
