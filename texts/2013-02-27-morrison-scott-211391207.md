 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Scott Morrison 

 Assault charges should provide wake up call for Labor's No Care No  Responsibility community release scheme for boat arrivals 

 Wednesday 27th February 2013 

 Confirmation that charges for an alleged indecent assault of a young woman have been laid against a Sri 

 Lankan man released into the community on a bridging visa pending assessment of his asylum claim after 

 having illegally entered Australia by boat, should serve as a wake up call to the Government to review the 

 policies and procedures, or lack thereof, for their community release program, Shadow Minister for 

 Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today.  

 

 “Labor's response to the case of the alleged indecent assault of a young woman in residential 

 accommodation at Macquarie University has highlighted their 'no care, no responsibility' approach to 

 releasing asylum seekers into the community,” Mr Morrison said.  

 

 “This latest incident demands a complete review of the guidelines and procedures for how people are 

 released into the community under this scheme, where they are located and what notification is given to the 

 community about their release, especially local police.  

 

 “Labor should suspend further release of boat arrivals into the community on bridging visas and community 

 detention, in all other than exceptional circumstances until Minister O Connor has had his Department 

 undertake a full review of the scheme and can give the community a clear guarantee that the lessons have 

 been learned and there are clear community safeguards in place.  

 

 “Such a review must detail:  

 

 â¢ An analysis of where the current 10,000 boat arrivals on bridging visas and in the community are currently 

 located, in what types of accommodation, at what cost and the suitability of that accommodation  

 

 â¢ The identification of accommodation types and locations that are not appropriate due to their proximity to 

 populations deemed to be vulnerable, with such assessments to be made after consulting local police and 

 other community service providers  

 

 â¢ A requirement to consult and notify police in advance of the release of boat arrivals on bridging visas or 

 into community detention in their jurisdiction  

 

 â¢ A requirement for neighbouring residents to be alerted in advance of boat arrivals being located in their 

 community on bridging visas or community detention  

 

 â¢ The establishment of behaviour protocols for boat arrivals placed on bridging visas or in community 

 detention, with clear negative sanctions for breaches of such protocols  

 

 â¢ Establishment of a complaints procedure for residents to contact the Department to advise of any 

 concerns about the behaviour of boat arrivals on bridging visas and in community detention  

 

 â¢ Mandatory reporting procedures for the Department, associated service providers or accommodation 

 providers for incidents involving boat arrivals on bridging visas and in community detention, including 

 breaches of behaviour protocols and complaints received.  

 

 â¢ Mandatory response protocols for the Department, associated service providers or accommodation 

 providers for classified incidents involving boat arrivals on bridging visas and in community detention  

 

 “We also call on the Government to implement the Coalition’s policy to ensure that access to benefits for 

 holders of bridging visas granted by the Gillard Government are subject to individuals satisfying mandatory 

 mutual obligation requirements, such as work for the dole.  

 

 “Labor needs to reverse their 'no care, no responsibility' approach to the community release of boat 

 arrivals, where the interests of the community are subsidiary to the person who arrived on the boat. Labor 

 needs to send a strong message to the more than 10,000 boat arrivals they have released into the 

 community that they are not out of sight, nor out of mind.  

 

 “Minister O’Connor must commission this review as a matter of urgency. His silence and refusal to address 

 these issues and instead continue to use Department of Immigration officials as a human shield for his own 

 Government's policy failings, underscores the lack of accountability this Government has always shown for 

 their failures on our border,” Mr Morrison said.
