 Kevin Andrews MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 

 

 A Strong Economy, Cohesive Society and Secure Nation 

 Budget Media Release  

 Tuesday, 8 May 2007  

 The Department of Immigration and Citizenship will receive additional funding  of $359 million in the 2007-08 Budget to help meet the labour force needs of  Australia’s economy, ensure we have a cohesive community and strong  border security. 

 The Australian Government’s new citizenship test will ensure new Australian  citizens are committed to Australia’s values and way of life. 

 The 2007-08 Budget provides funding of $123.6 million over five years to  deliver the Australian Government’s new citizenship test, to be introduced in  2007. 

 The planning number for the Migration Programme will be set at 152,800  places in 2007-08. This level will strengthen our economy and maintain a  strong cohesive community. The Skilled Migration Stream will have a modest  increase of 5,000 places with a total of 102,500 places. The family stream will  be maintained at the 2006-07 level of 50,000 places. 

 The 2007-08 Budget will strengthen Australia’s borders against the  increasingly sophisticated criminal networks who engage in people smuggling.  Ten additional Airline Liaison Officers (ALOs) will be placed at overseas  airports. The Australian Government will also provide funding of $7.7 million to  the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Indonesia. The funding  will provide training and resources for the care of intercepted people and a  dedicated unit to manage voluntary returns. 

 The Australian Government is committed to supporting humanitarian entrants  to settle in Australia and become part of the Australian community. The 2007-08 Budget delivers $209.2 million over four years to assist recently arrived  refugee and humanitarian entrants to settle into the community. The Budget  also maintains 13,000 places for refugees and humanitarian entrants.
