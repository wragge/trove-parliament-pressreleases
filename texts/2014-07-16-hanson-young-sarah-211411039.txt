 Greens’ bill to strip Immigration Minister of guardianship   

 The Greens ‘Guardian for Unaccompanied Children Bill’, which would see the legal  guardianship of unaccompanied refugee children taken from the Immigration Minister,  will be introduced into the Senate today.   

 “Despite being the legal guardian to almost 400 refugee children in Australia, the  Immigration Minister is still insisting on putting them behind bars,” Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young said.   

 “Right now dozens of unaccompanied children are locked up in horrific conditions on  Nauru and Christmas Island. It’s high time the Minister was stripped of his role as these  children’s official guardian.”   

 The inappropriate nature of the Minister’s guardianship was put into stark relief when 12  young refugees from Adelaide fled in terror after their friends were rounded up and put  into detention last week.   

 “These children were forced into hiding as they fled from their official guardian, the  Immigration Minister. Many of these children have been running from danger for their  entire lives and this bill will simply give them a genuine guardian who will actually look  after them,” Senator Hanson-Young said.   

 “As it stands, these kids have been abandoned by the Australian legal system and  imprisoned by the very person who is supposed to be caring for them.   

 “Scott Morrison is these children’s jailer, not their guardian, and I call on all of my  colleagues in the Parliament to support this bill.”   

 

 The Greens’ bill would establish an independent office of Guardian for Unaccompanied  Children, which would; 

 - Advocate for the best interests of unaccompanied minors, including advocating  against their detention and ensuring appropriate care, education and support  - Consult with other agencies and services   - Report directly to Parliament  - Monitor and review laws, policies and practices which impact on unaccompanied 

 minors
