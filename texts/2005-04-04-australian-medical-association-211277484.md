 AMA PROPOSES BETTER HEALTH CARE FOR REFUGEES AND  NEW IMMIGRANTS   

 Senior AMA GPs are calling on the Government to give refugees and new immigrants access  to a comprehensive health assessment by a general practitioner.    

 At  its  meeting  in  Canberra  over  the  weekend,  the  AMA  Council  of  General  Practice   (AMACGP) discussed the need for a separate Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) item number  to provide quality health care for people who are beginning or seeking to begin a new life in  Australia.   

 AMACGP  Chair,  Dr  Rod  Pearce,  said  a  new  Medicare  item  would  assist  refugees  who  have   experienced  trauma  and  danger  gain  access  to  a  proper  comprehensive  health  assessment  as   soon as possible.    

 “Most refugees entering Australia have had a basic health check in their country of origin, but  this screening is not comprehensive and may have been conducted months or years before they  actually arrived here,” Dr Pearce said.   

 “Refugees usually have had limited health care in the past, are unlikely to have their medical  records with them when they arrive, and they may not speak English.   

 “A  thorough  health  assessment  is  as  important  to  Australia  as  it  is  for  the  people  seeking  to   enter Australia.   

 “While  the  patient’s  physical  and  mental  health  is  being  assessed  by  the  GP,  they  are  being   screened  for  infectious  diseases  that  could  spread  to  the  Australian  community,”  Dr  Pearce   said.   

 The AMA has initiated discussions on this new Medicare item with the Government.
