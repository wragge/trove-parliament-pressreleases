  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, PERTH

  ATTORNEY-GENERAL: 

  Thankyou for coming out this morning. I just wanted to confirm that we’ve have   reports from the United States that Jean-Phillipe Wispelaere has been sentenced in   accordance with a plea agreement that was entered into on the gfh March. He was   sentenced yesterday to a term of 15 years imprisonment. Of that term he will be   obliged to serve 10 years minimum in the United States. The two years imprisonment   he’s already had will count against the sentence. The sentence is for the offence of 

  attempted espionage to which he pleaded guilty at the hearing on the Sth of March. He   removed from the Defence Intelligence Organisation a substantial quantity of   documents and then endeavoured to sell them to foreign governments in Thailand. As   far as the question of him servi:ng any part of his term of imprisonment in Australia is   concerned, we do have legislation in place in Australia that would enable   arrangements to be made but those arrangements are not yet in place. We expect they   will be in place within the next eight years, but it would involve a request by 

  Wispelaere and then agreement between the Commonwealth and the relevant State OI   Territory where Wispelaere preferred to or requested to be transferred. There are no   federal prisons as such so any i:mprisonment in Australia would have to be served in a   State or Territory prison. 

  JOURNALIST: 

  Does it concern you that a person who’s now been discovered to have a mental illness   is actually able to find employment [inaudible]? 

  ATTORNEY-GENERAL: 

  Well I can’t comment on the circumstances under which he was employed. He did go   through the appropriate DIO procedures but as to what they involved I can’t comment.   But I . . . from the information that we’ve been given, it seems that the . . . any illness he 

  2 

  suffered wasn’t a permanent condition. He was very carefully considered as to fitnes!;   to plead in the United States an,d found to be fit to plead and his lawyers accepted fiat. 

  JOURNALIST: 

  This man’s father is claiming that the system has let him down because he was 11   confirmed schizophrenic. Do you, well that must disturb you? 

  ATTORNEY-GENERAL: 

  Well I can’t comment on whether he is a schizophrenic or confirmed schizophrenic,   He certainly appeared to suffer some mental illness while he was in imprisonment in   the United States but the condition before that I’m not aware of. 

  JOURNALIST: 

  His lawyers describe the vetting process by Australia as woefully inadequate. Does,   that mean we should tighten our vetting process here. 

  ATTORNEY-GENERAL: 

  Well you may recall that following his arrest, the Prime Minister asked the Inspector   General of Intelligence and Security to conduct a review of security procedures a,&   steps were taken in accordance with the Inspector General’s recommendations tc   tighten up procedures. In fact it didn’t only relate to the Defence Intelligence   Organisation, it related to security organisations across government. Among the   recommendations was for a trial of the use of polygraphs, lie detectors, on a voluntary   basis. 

  JOURNALIST: 

  What do you hope to learn from that practice? 

  ATTORNEY-GENERAL: 

  Well, the trialling in AS10 has not been completed so I can’t comment on that. As   part of the terms of the plea agreement, Wispelaere did himself undergo a polygraph   test. 

  Okay? Thanks very much. 

  JOURNALIST: 

  Can I just ask you on another issue, Senator Ellison’s behaviour [inaudible] is it   appropriate behaviour for a Minister? 

  ATTORNEY-GENERAL: 

  Well Senator Ellison has himself described it as inappropriate behaviour. He is highly   embarrassed by the incident, he very much regrets it and he has apologised to the   director of the Australian Protective Service and as far as I’m concerned that’s the end   of the matter. 

  JOURNALIST:   [Inaudible] anybody spoken to him about that issue? 

  ATTORNEY-GENERAL: 

  There’s been discussions and the result is the statements that you’ve seen made.

  JOURNALIST: 

  One other final question as well, the refugees process, we’ve had a few comments   from judiciary in the last few days which have been [inaudible] how we handle our   refugees. What’s your comment on the judiciary weighing in.to an Immigration   Department area? 

  ATTORNEY-GENERAL: 

  Well I don’t want to make any comment that might be seen as commenting on a case   that is currently before the courts. 

  What I’ve said on a number of occasions in the past is that under our Constitution we   have a separation of the judiciary from the executive and from the Parliament. It’s   important that the executive and the Parliament let the judiciary do their job and not   interfere with it. Equally it’s important that the judiciary not use any muscle they hold   for the purposes of weighing into a. political issue. It has the potential to damage the   standing of the judiciary and it’ E, independence and the appearance of subjectivity that   is important for public confidence in the courts. 

  JOURNALIST: 

  Is there not a complexity for the judge though, because on the one hand he’s trying to   reach decision on the case of a refugee [inaudible] the best case of child when   Australia is signatory to a convention that says these refugees shouldn’t be detained. 

  ATTORNEY-GENERAL: 

  In any individual case, the obligation of a judge or a magistrate is to determine the case   according to law. There are well established principles for determining how the law is   to be ascertained, including in relation to international obligations Australia has   entered into. 

  In general terms, obligations under treaties are not binding in domestic law until   they’ve been incorporated into domestic law by the Parliaments of the Commonwealtl.   or the States or the Territories. Now the exercise of discretion is a matter for the   judicial officer but it must be done in accordance with the confines of the relevant law. 

  JOURNALIST: 

  But treaties do create a legitimate expectation [inaudible] 

  ATTORNEY-GENERAL: 

  Well the High Court in Teoh’s case said a person’s entitled [tape ends]
