 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP PRESS CONFERENCE  WESLEY CENTRE. SYDNEY

 Jmlst:

 ... changes to citizenship reflect the concern that migrants don’t have enough  commitment to Australia?

 Hewson:

 We think it’s about time that we had a look at that piece of legislation which, as I said,  dates back to 1948 and recognise that that legislation doesn’t specify the rights and  responsibilities of citizenship.

 We’d like to elevate citizenship, give it more prominence in the Australian way of life  and our proposals are constructively along that line.

 Jmlst:

 Is it your concern that migrants dont have enough commitment to a country? 

 Hewson:

 No, not at all. It’s important as part of a national process of maturation in a country  like Australia to keep considering some of these issues and it's been a long time since  we’ve looked at the issue of citizenship. We've had a dramatic change in the nature  of our society and we now have, I think, a very important and vibrant multicultural 

 society and in that context l think it's a reasonable question to look at it. It's not in any  sense meant to be a criticism of migrants that have come to Australia.

 Jmlst:

 But they should know the words to the national anthem?

 Hewson:

 I think it's important that all Australians understand what the words to the national  anthem are, that they understand the significance of our flag and other symbols of our  institutional processes and I think most migrants would say that's a good idea. The  feedback I've had has been very positive to that type of suggestion.

 Jmlst:

 Dr Hewson how far would unemployment and the foreign debt have to fall before a  Coalition Government would increase the immigration intake?

 Hewson:

 Well we haven't specified that. We'd want to see, as I said, evidence of sustainable  improvement in the labour market and sustainable improvement in a number of other  indicators. And I guess the one that most people emphasise is what is now an 

 alarming problem with international debt.

 I am a firm believer in an expanded immigration intake in the right circumstances.  There is no doubt that the immigration program over the post-War period has made  a very substantial contribution to Australia both economically and socially and I would  be looking to the opportunity to restore that program.

 But clearly in the short term, in the near term, while the labour market is the way it is,  while some of our indicators continue to go the wrong way, while we are in the worst  recession in 60 years, we don't have the capacity to absorb an expanded migrant  intake. We have to cut it and it doesn't do those migrants much good either when a  very significant percentage of them end up on unemployment or other benefits.

 Jmlst:

 Will you be nominating a figure before the next election as to how many?

 Hewson:

 No, I specifically said in my remarks that we've shied away from setting fixed targets  because we think the setting of fixed targets and elevating the achievement of the  target above the efficiency of administration and the proficiency of the entry criteria

 assessment and procedures has been one of the great failings of our immigration  policy in recent years. The Government has gone out after numbers and not worried  about the integrity of the program and over that period they've actually significantly  eroded, I believe, the integrity of our immigration program.

 Jmlst:

 You must have some idea of how many you are going cut?

 Hewson:

 I gave you some numbers as to where they've fallen to in recessions in the past. I  drew attention to the fact that those recessions were of a lesser order of magnitude  than the current one. In the past I've said a net immigration intake somewhere  between about 50,000 and 75,000 is where it's fallen to in the past, which would put 

 us, if we worked into that range, significantly below the Government. Setting ai specific  target defeats the purpose of a lot of the other reforms that we've got to put in place  on the immigration program. /  .

 Jmlst:

 On the issue of refugees you are critical of the Federal Government's handling of the  issue. What about the 113 Chinese who were sent back without any full legal  recourse to their entry as boat people. Do you support their actions on that?

 Hewson:

 I'm not sure of the specifics of that case, but as a general principle I have argued very  strongly and consistently for a case by case assessment of all refugee cases. And  we think there is no alternative, it's the fairest and most equitable way to deal with the  problem.

 Jmlst:

 ... (inaudible) ...

 Hewson:

 No, what I'm saying is it shouldn't and I think it's a national disgrace that we have over  20,000 or 21,000 I think it is of these undetermined cases at the present time. It's no  good for them and it's no good for us and that's why I have suggested a number of  changes including a redeployment of resources into that process so that there is an  effective and quick determination of their status. If they are in a position where they  could well be persecuted to return to their country of origin, then of course they would 

 qualify to -stay here in Australia. If they're not then we have to deal with the  circumstances as they unfold. But it is an essential part of maintaining the integrity of

 our immigration program, just as it's important that we maintain our record, and a very,  very good record I believe we have by world standards on humanitarian grounds in  dealing with genuine refugee cases.

 Jmlst:

 On another matter having seen the reports, read the reports this morning, seen them  last night, having slept on it overnight, what are your thoughts of the demonstration  in Victoria yesterday?

 Hewson:

 I'm absolutely appalled that people like our Prime Minister our aiding and abetting, if  not organising, what are now going to be a series of national strikes. Here is the man  that's thrown this country into the worst recession in 60 years, he's created a million  unemployed and those people who have managed to keep their jobs have simply 

 seen their living standards eroded. And in that context he sets out to fundamentally  divide the nation and whip up a hysterical reaction among a small section of the  Australian community, trying to suggest that this is what life would be like under  Hewson.

 The man is a national disgrace in whipping up division like that and confrontation like  that only for his own short term political ends. All he is worried about is surviving. All  he is worried about is ensuring his own political survival, his own job, he couldn't care  aboutzanyone else's job, he couldn't care about the pain and hardship that he's 

 inflicted on average Australians.

 And as I have said in the last couple of days, he wants the next election to be a  referendum, well it will be - it will be on that sort of behaviour, .it will be on his record  of a million unemployed, it will be on his record of tens of thousands of bankruptcies,  if not hundreds of thousands of bankruptcies, it will be on his record of throwing this  country into the worst economic circumstances in 60 years.

 I really believe to look at the possibility of this Prime Minister extending the process  out to maybe May with a whole series of rolling strikes and national strikes and other  forms of disruption is just not what this country can tolerate at the present time and  I formally challenge him - go to an election as fast as possible so the people of  Australia have a chance to vote on a referendum of his economic mismanagement.

 Jmlst:

 But you would support the right of workers to demonstrate wouldn't you?

 REF: TRANSCR\0633\BQ 5.

 Hewson:

 Look I always support people's rights but this is a political strike, this is all about  ensuring the privileged position of a few union Leaders. And go around and talk to  some of these union leaders and see how many of them have lost their jobs in recent  days. And then ask them about how they feel about the million of their members who  have lost their jobs.

 This strike is a political strike in defence of a small group of quite militant union leaders  who are protecting a very privileged position in Australian society.

 Jmlst:

 But they didn't drag the 100,000 onto the street, did they? There were 100,000 people  protesting against the policies of Jeff Kennett.

 Hewson:

 But there are a whole host of people in Victoria, millions of people who voted for Jeff  Kennett to do a job and to fix Victoria as a basket case. It's about time we stepped  back and looked at this, Victoria is a basket case, it needs some tough medicine and  Jeff Kennett is to be applauded for standing out there and taking the decisions that  he was elected to put in place.

 Jmlst:

 But should he have come clean in the first instance and given all the detail? 

 Hewson:

 We've said that the broad elements of his industrial relations policy were released.  Some of the changes that were announced after the election in relation to leave  loading he's explained in terms of having to find money to deal with the problem,  having had the debt position of Victoria downgraded.

 And quite frankly dont try and tag Jeff Kennett for some of that, go back and ask why  was that debt standing downgraded? It had a lot to do with the fact that John  Dawkins and others, Paul Keating, lied to the people of Australia in the Budget. They 

 lied by stating a debt figure for Victoria which they knew to be wrong and which the  Victorians had told them was wrong, but they went ahead and misled the Australian  people to try and ensure the political survival of the Kirner Government. And as a 

 result of that whole very profligate debt experience under the Cain/Kirner Government,  the standing of the Victorian debt has been significantly downgraded - that's another  cost on the people of Victoria and potentially another cost on the people of Australia.

 REF: TRANSCR\0633\BQ 6.

 What you’ve got now is a group of people like Keating and Dawkins and Halfpenny  trying to ensure their privileged positions and protect their job at the expense at  everyone else's job.

 Sure, there could have been 100,000 people in the streets over that, but you wait until  the Australian community, the forgotten Australians, if you like, people that have been  ostracised in their own society as a result of this Government and this Prime Minister,  wait until they get out in the streets and demand the end of Paul Keating and his 

 Government.

 Jmlst:

 Dr Hewson has the Caucus done the right thing in shelving tobacco sponsorship  restrictions?

 Hewson:

 We've always had a very simple view about restrictions of that type. To be clear we  haven't seen the legislation so we cant comment on the legislation but we've always  taken a Party position against banning things that are legal, or banning the advertising  of things that are legal. I think it's important that we keep a sense of perspective on  this issue. I will look forward to seeing the legislation if it ever emerges. It seems like 

 it's a bit of a dog fight within the Caucus at this stage and we will be taking steps to  determine what is the true position from the Government's point of view.
