 Senator Amanda Vanstone  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND  INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS

 Just when you think you've heard it all...

 VPS 83/2004

 Channel Seven has admitted that it cannot substantiate allegations it has aired, claiming abuse of detainees at  Baxter Detention Centre.

 Interviewed on ABC Radio this morning, reporter Chris Warren, said:

 'We're not in a position to be able to prove or disprove these allegations, we're just putting them out thereâ€¦'.

 This is an admission that the reporter and his employer has not even attempted to run a cursory check across  the allegations made before 'putting them out there'.

 Given this seriously appalling journalism, one must question the allegations and the motives of those involved  in airing them.

 For example, had the reporter bothered to check with me or my department before airing the claim that a  detainee at Port Hedland was given medical treatment against his will, he would have been advised that the  detainee's mother, his legal guardian at that time, had approved the medical treatment - in November 2000,  when he was held as a minor at Woomera Detention Centre.
