 AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS PRESS RELEASES

 Democrats launch "Not Happy, John" mini- movie  The Australian Democrats, who first used the slogan "Not Happy, John", on T-shirts before the 2001  election, have today launched a new "Not Happy, John" internet mini-movie on the same day a multi-partisan campaign on the theme was launched.   

 Democrat candidate, Peter Goldfinch, joined all other Bennelong candidates (except John Howard) at  a public meeting in Sydney today, supporting the launch of another "Not Happy, John" campaign. This  campaign asks voters in Bennelong to put John Howard last on the ballot paper.   

 "For pursuing the same policies as One Nation, John Howard deserves the same preference  treatment we previously reserved for One Nation - last," said Peter Goldfinch, Democrat Candidate for  Bennelong.   

 "Not Happy John" was first seen graffitied in Brisbane, soon after the Tampa incident, when the  Legislation was before Parliament before the 2001 election.   

 Senator Andrew Bartlett, Leader of the Democrats, said the Tampa decision was probably the root of  "Not Happy, John" but since then it had been joined by children overboard, weapons overboard and a  rising level of distrust of the Government over the last three years.    

 In a play on a popular Telstra advertisement slogan, "Not Happy John" was graffitied in huge letters  on the side of a warehouse in Fortitude Valley, Brisbane near Senator Andrew Bartlett's office, and  was printed onto Democrat T-shirts and first worn to a refugee rally at Brisbane city hall, attended by  thousands, not long before the 2001 election.    

 The Democrats "Not Happy, John" mini-movie (which uses music by Andrew Bartletts former band,  The Cutters), can be seen at http://www.liedetectors.net.au/nothappyjohn/movie/ or on the website  www.democrats.org.au .
