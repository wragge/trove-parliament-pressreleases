 TRANSCRIPT   

 TONY BURKE MP 

 

        Member for Watson  Shadow Minister for Immigration   

  TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA   THURSDAY 15 JUNE 2006, 1.20PM   

 Subject:  Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006.  ________________________________________________________________________ 

 

 E&OE-PROOF ONLY   

 Tony Burke:  Well it is twenty past one.  Yesterday morning the House of  Representatives carried a resolution moved by Tony Abbott which said twenty past one  would be the end of the debate on the Migration Amendment Bill.  We said that the  debate shouldn’t be gagged and we were assured by the Government that twenty past one  today would be all the time we would possibly need to debate this Bill.   

 It’s now twenty past one and the Government still doesn’t know if it supports the Bill.   The reason the Government’s having problems is really simple.  Twelve months ago, we  all agreed on a few principles.  Those principles are thrown out the window with this new 

 legislation.  Those principles become meaningless with this new legislation and you can’t  fix it by amending it.  The reason you can’t fix it by amending it is really simple.  The  things that you’d want to change apply to the law of Nauru; they apply to the law of  Papua New Guinea and Manus Island.  This Parliament has jurisdiction over a whole lot 

 of things, but we don’t have jurisdiction over other countries.     

 The Prime Minister seems to believe that Indonesia has jurisdiction over us and  Australian Members of Parliament are saying ‘well they don’t’.  Australia’s sovereignty  is more important than trying to cheer up a friend.  Australia’s sovereignty is more  important than trying to make sure that we’ve let Indonesia feel that we have given them  control of our immigration system.   

 John Howard is now realising that you can’t amend the Bill.  And that means he has two  groups in complete conflict:  the Indonesian Government, having been given a ridiculous  expectation that the law would be changed at their behest, and the Australian people and  Australian Members of Parliament knowing everything we said we believed in 12 months  ago we were serious about.     

 John Howard has to choose whether to appease one group or the other.  I reckon he  should choose Australians. 

 

 Journalist:  So your saying in relation to Labor’s policy that whatever concessions, if a  compromise is reached between the Prime Minister and the rebel backbenchers, Labor  still won’t support the Bill? 

 

 Tony Burke:  No, because this Bill whatever concessions they offer will still involve  taking people out of Australia and dumping them in another country.  Say if they get a  concession as to whether children will be detained or whether they will be free, when that  is actually implemented it won’t be implemented under Australian law- it will be  implemented at the total discretion of the Government of Nauru.  So it doesn’t matter  what concessions can be claimed to be given during all of this, ultimately we are saying:  ‘this Parliament will be in control’.  Now I don’t think you abandon your sovereignty to  try to improve your relationship with a neighbour.   

 Journalist:  Gary Humphries crossed the floor, do you hope that other Senators will do  likewise with this Migration Bill?   

 Tony Burke:  Certainly and I can’t for a minute understand how any member of  Parliament would find themselves voting in favour of this.  The Members of Parliament  who have been most in favour of this Bill, are Members of a Parliament that sits in  Jakarta.  They’re the Members of Parliament who have been in favour of this legislation.   There’s no reason for anybody to vote in favour of this Bill unless they think it’s good to  have children in detention so long as it is in another country; unless you think indefinite  detention is fine so long as it doesn’t happen on our shores.  This Bill involves pretending  Australia is a nation without a border.  It throws out everything that every single Member  of this Parliament voted for only one year ago.   

 Journalist:  So are you talking with Government Senators about this and trying to  convince them not to vote in favour of it?   

 Tony Burke:  I am making my comments publicly and doing it publicly at every  opportunity.  Labor’s position from the moment this was announced was clear and  emphatic.  This is a move in the complete wrong direction.  No amendment will make  bad legislation, intolerable legislation into something we find acceptable.     

 Journalist:  Tony do you mind bullet-pointing for us Labor’s problem with this Bill?   

 Tony Burke:  Our problem with this Bill is that it takes people from Australia and dumps  them in another country.  That’s our problem.  What does that then mean?  It then means  you lose control as to whether or not children will be in detention; you have no say as to  whether people are held indefinitely; you can no longer deliver case-managed mental  health care; the full oversight of the Commonwealth Ombudsman cannot be delivered  when you are reliant on the law of another country.  There is no way of delivering  Australian standards when you are under the legal jurisdiction of another country.     

 Journalist:  So do you think that Australia should be the country of first resort for  asylum seekers or a country of last resort for asylum seekers?   

 Tony Burke:  If somebody is desperately fleeing persecution, they are not going to look  at a map and say ‘what are the policies of these different nations’.  If you are fleeing  persecution, you get out of there.  Rarely will those people find themselves landing in  Australia, but sometimes they will and when they do, we have obligations and we should  follow them through.  They’re obligations about decency that Australians support.   

 Journalist:  And that obligation is to accept refugees here as (inaudible)?   

 Tony Burke:  The obligation is to process the claims and determine whether they are  refugees and if they are refugees you give them protection in Australia.   

 Journalist:  Do you have a challenge to Coalition Members and Senators?   

 Tony Burke:  The challenge is simple:  If you are going to vote in favour of this  legislation, please let me know why it is wrong to lock children up in Australia but right  to do it in other countries; please explain to the Australian people why indefinite  detention is wrong on our shores, but right on others; let me know why case-managed  mental health care is so critical here but it doesn’t matter at all if it’s being delivered to  the same people once you throw them in another place; why was the oversight of the  Commonwealth Ombudsman important for Australian detention centres, but doesn’t  matter at all for how you treat people in Nauru?  I don’t understand how you get one set  of morality within our nation and you can throw that all away by taking people  elsewhere.
