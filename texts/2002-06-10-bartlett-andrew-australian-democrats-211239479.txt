 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 10 June 2002  MEDIA RELEASE                          02/299

 Pacific Nightmare The Australian Democrats have warned that the latest attempts by the Federal Government to recreate the atmosphere of last September by painting a picture of Australia under siege by floods of refugees, was in reality an attempt to break away from the Refugee Convention.

 Australian Democrats Spokesperson for Immigration, Senator Andrew Bartlett said, “There is no difference between the Torres Strait and Cape York; they are both part of Queensland.”

 “The next logical step for the Government will be to introduce legislation, which makes it impossible for all asylum seekers to apply for a protection visa onshore,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “So, the next move that we suspect the Government might make will mean we not only breach the Convention, but will be out of it all together.

 “This approach is an abdication of responsibility. It is imposing our responsibilities on to poorer countries - no wonder the Nauru Government is upset.

 “Instead of finding a solution for desperate people in need of sanctuary the Government has placed the refugees and their hosts in an endless holding pattern.

 “There can be no better proof that the Pacific solution is not working than the story that there is another boatload of refugees preparing to leave Indonesia.

 “If the Government had been serious about preventing people travelling on boats to Australia it would have put in a comprehensive program to take people who have been assessed by UNHCR and are waiting in Indonesia for a long-term resolution to their plight.

 “There is no doubt this a turning point for the ALP. These excisions from the Migration zone are only a short step to the final solution. The ALP should resist the pressure of stories of asylum seekers coming in floods; they must not allow the Government to implement a system that prevents asylum seekers from applying for protection whilst in Australia.

 “If this is allowed to continue we will be the proud owner of island camps for refugees that are reminiscent of the camps in Hong Kong and Thai border where people spent decades of their lives living in ghetto like conditions,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
