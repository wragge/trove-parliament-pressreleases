 Brown Stand on Tampa Vindicated

 A poll of the Tasmanian electorate shows the overwhelming majority of Greens voters back the position taken by Greens Senator Bob Brown over the Tampa refugee issue.

 “Almost 80% of Greens voters do not support the Howard Government’s handling of the Tampa issue,” Senator Brown said.

 “The electorate is polarizing extraordinarily with a huge gulf opening up between Liberal and Green voters with Labor somewhere in the middle.

 “The poll, conducted by Tasmania pollster Richard Herr, shows that 67% of Tasmanians back Howard’s stand. Liberal voters overwhelming supported the PM with 87.9% backing him while 65.8% of Labor voters endorsed Howard’s actions. Only 20.3% of Greens supported the Prime Minister.

 “The 67% figure is less support than in other published opinion polls and I believe if Labor had shown leadership on the issue by supporting the rights of the asylum seekers, polls would be running at 50-50 at best for Mr Howard,” said Senator Brown.
