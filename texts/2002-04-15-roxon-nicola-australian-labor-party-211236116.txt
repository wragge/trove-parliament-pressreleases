 Shadow Minister for Children and Health

 SYDNEY INSTITUTE SPEECH - 15 APRIL 2002

 BUILDING POLITICAL RELEVANCE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

 Let me start by dispelling the myth that young people are not interested in

 politics.  I don’t believe this and think it is a cop out, as a politician, to

 assert it. It may be that many young people are just not that interested in

 US!  Or perhaps not interested in our language and maybe even the issues

 we identify?

 In a recent survey Labor did of young people, one of the questions was

 “what would you do if you were Prime Minister for the day?”:

 Listen to this:

 â¢ from an 11 year old girl from Pascoe Vale, Victoria: “The first

 thing I would do if I were PM would be to give money to the

 poor, homeless and lonely people.”

 â¢ Amanda, 25 from Birkdale in Qld “Look at the price of living

 in today’s world.  All we do is work and pay bills.  I’d hate to

 have kids as well.  We would do nothing, we don’t get out

 much as it is.”

 â¢ “I would build more skate parks and bike jumps and since I’ve

 taken John Howard’s job I would send him to Afghanistan and

 he would not be allowed to enter the country” -from an 11 year

 old boy!

 â¢ I would think, what the hell am I doing being a Prime Minister

 (Female 14, Braybrook Victoria)

 More seriously, listen to this response from 23 year old Jessica from Qld:

 “It is impossible to narrow down all the concerns of today’s young persons to

 3 items, but it’s welcoming to see an opportunity to voice such concerns.  Most

 young people feel totally alienated from the political process let alone

 understand how it actually works - hell I’ve talked to 35 year olds who thought

 globalisation had something to do with basketball (maybe it does).

 The point is a lot of us have given up, given up on growing up - because once

 we’re old enough to do your job the mess will be so bad, so irreversibly

 damaged we might as well take drugs or jump off bridges or shoot our

 teachers.

 All I want is to breathe clean air when I ride my bike to work, instead of

 choking on car fumes.

 I want to eat food free of pesticides and chemicals.

 I want the police to protect me instead of harassing me and searching me as I

 walk down the street.

 I want to work and earn enough money so it’s not worth being on the dole.

 I want a workplace free of slaps to the arse.

 And one day, when I have a husband, and have children, I hope the damage is

 less, so I can teach them to live responsibly.”

 These quotes come from a survey and consultation process which has

 been conducted by me and other Labor MPs with young people in the last

 few months.  I will talk about it more later, but what I think is very clear

 is that these young people care about the world around them, worry about

 their future and have plenty to say.  Isn’t this a recipe for political interest

 and engagement?

 Polls clearly tell us that Labor is still by far and away the most attractive

 party for 18-24 year olds, attracting around 43% of the primary vote, in

 contrast with the Liberals who get around 26% and the Nationals on

 around 3%.  Nevertheless, Labor is concerned about its vote, particularly

 its primary vote, dropping amongst young people.  There still remains a

 view within our party and within politics generally that young people

 more often vote “left” than when they are older.

 In the emerging generations, such an assumption is not necessarily

 holding up, or not to the extent it used to.

 â¢ Using public Morgan Polls, 18-24 year olds at the last election

 told us they intended to give us their primary vote at a rate of

 only 1.2% more than the general population said they would.

 â¢ In contrast, in 1990, they gave us their primary vote by 10.4%

 more than the general population.

 â¢ Our primary vote in the age group 18-24 has dropped 14% since

 1984.

 This is something that we are concerned about, not only because of its

 obvious electoral implications, but because we believe that Labor’s

 message about what it can do for young people is not reaching them - and

 we believe they deserve a better deal than they are currently getting from

 the current Federal Government.

 I spoke recently about this issue at the Young Labor Conference and

 ways the ALP might structure itself differently to help attract more young

 people as members, with a flow on benefit in attracting more young

 voters.  The main suggestion was to look at ways of organising around

 issues & areas of interest, not just locality as we currently do.

 Of particular concern to me is a risk that we may be seen by young

 people as vacating the field to the Greens (or even Democrats), in areas of

 interest to them.  Not only shouldn’t we do this, but Labor doesn’t need to

 do this.  On issues like the environment and international affairs we have

 a record to be proud of and shouldn’t be spooked out of trying to sell this

 message properly.

 Let’s just look at two at these two areas as examples.  First, the

 environment.  Recently released research by Australian Council for

 Educational Research found that 75% of 14 years olds surveyed believe

 that taking part in protecting the environment is important.

 With such a high rating on this single issue I believe the Greens’

 popularity is assisted by its clear identity with this issue.  The very thing

 so many young people care about is written right there on the ballot paper

 with the name of the party - the Greens.  They are a single issue party,

 easily understood and attractive.

 But why should we merely vacate this political field to one issue parties?

 Labor has a history of good environmental policies and achieving

 sensible balances between environmental needs and jobs.  We have made

 hard and good decisions on the Franklin Dam, for example, Antarctica,

 even establishing Landcare.  We are the only major party pushing for

 Australia to sign the Kyoto Protocol.

 The second example is global politics.   The Australian Labor Party was

 instrumental in setting up the United Nations, we supported and promoted

 beyond our shores an enormous range of treaties on international labour

 standards and women’s rights, we led the way in the Cambodian Peace

 process.  Labor activists campaigned on international issues such as the

 war in Vietnam and apartheid in South Africa.  We still care about and I

 believe could interest young people on many issues such as world

 poverty, the AIDS epidemic, child labour, women’s rights and freedom in

 the Middle East, and even the impact of international money movements

 or multinational investment decisions, not to mention the world wide

 web.

 These are just two issues that are high profile examples for young people.

 The point was enhanced by our survey results showing a very high

 interest in “social justice” issues from world peace, to poverty and

 racism.

 Labor, with the lions share of voters who are 18-24 preferring us over any

 other party, still has the sense and foresight to see that this can change,

 that the community is changing and we need to look at trends that affect

 this and develop policies and communication strategies long term to help

 woo young voters.

 Labor can do a lot better, but the hysteria around the growing Green and

 Democrat vote amongst young people is just not being supported by their

 results.  They certainly have a niche but, as smaller parties, they can

 afford to focus narrowly.  Diedre Macken describes the Democrats

 phenomenon last year in an interesting way:

 “The Democrats have always been an in between party - in between

 the seat of government and house of review, in between the hard-nosed liberals and the factionally fraught Labor, even in between the

 Greens and One Nation - but they could end up the party of a

 demographic transition - in between high school and the first

 mortgage party.”1

 Nevertheless, it may be that this “transitional group”, between high

 school and home buying is growing in size.

 Last year’s study by the Committee for Economic Development of

 Australia on “Future Directions in Australian Social Policy”2 clearly

 shows that young people:

 â¢ can no longer rely on any kind of certainty in the labour market,

 â¢ either by choice or necessity they are entering home ownership

 much later if at all,

 â¢ the likelihood of settling with a partner and deciding to have

 children is also happening later if at all, and

 â¢ many more women will never have children of their own.

 In the last 20 years the birth rate for 20-24 year olds has nearly halved,

 and for 25-29 year olds it has dropped by a third.  The transitions and

 patterns that young people in the past have gone through with some level

 of predictability are no longer stable.

 If the traditional patterns of moving from education to employment, from

 family home to independent living, from adolescence to adulthood are

 occurring later in life for this generation of young people, then this must

 have implications for the role of young people and their interests in the

 political process.  Never more so than before, it is clear that policies

 2  Committee for Economic Development of Australia, “Future Directions in Australian Social Policy”, Growth 49, December 2001

 “about young people” need to cover a wide range of issues, both in terms

 of age and in terms of life stages.

 I think this group will increasingly look critically at policies like the first

 home owner scheme, the new baby bonus and other family benefits,

 especially if they favour a particular type of lifestyle.   Clearly some of

 the factors influencing young people to delay buying homes and having

 children will include economic pressures, thus some of these types of

 policies might be looked at favourably.  The flip side, however, is that as

 more and more people don’t buy homes or have children that they will

 see these policies as very narrowly targeted (and not at them) and not

 necessarily see why they merit public expenditure or how helpful they are

 to the broader community.

 Particularly on questions like assistance for children there are some risks.

 The “child free” movement here is pretty much non-existent but not so in

 the United States - where they talk about children being a “consumer

 choice” of the parents.  I don’t agree with this philosophy.  But I think

 that if we accept a political approach which looks to support parents and

 families only through direct financial incentive, then we will increasingly

 alienate non-parents - the growing group amongst young people.

 We must be able to set out the arguments supporting investment in

 children, why it is important to the community as a whole and its future,

 and not just rely on parents alone understanding this.  Otherwise it has

 long term consequences for us all, especially the way we use public

 money to assist families.

 It seems to me that whichever party grapples fully with these changes

 first and properly understands the patterns and differing needs of today’s

 young people, will have the best chance of winning this group of young

 voters.  And perhaps it might also help establish loyalties that may last

 into the future.

 As some of these transitions and lifestyles diversify for young people

 other issues like leisure & recreation could become increasingly

 important.  If people are not necessarily wedded to voting for one party

 because of their family or economic policies they would look more

 broadly.

 Let me briefly tell you how this survey I keep talking about came about.

 I was promoted to the front bench after the last election and given the

 new portfolio of Children and Youth.   I quickly recognised that young

 people are largely not among the groups that come to our offices, ring

 talkback radio, write letters to the paper.  Their voices are often not heard

 in the political sphere.  So Labor conducted a survey that generated

 responses from nearly 2500 young people across the country.    Not a bad

 number of replies from an age group everyone keeps saying isn’t

 interested in politics!

 In addition, last week, as part of National Youth week, I co-ordinated 8

 Labor members, including our Leader Simon Crean, in a range of

 activities with young people.  Amongst other things, I spent a shift on the

 check out at Coles, others worked as apprentices, went to TAFE, went

 horse riding and to other sporting events.   Our main aim was to go out

 and talk with, and in many cases work and study alongside, young people

 rather than expect them to come to us or use other more traditional ways

 of lobbying MPs.

 Overall the Report includes information from over 3000 young people.

 You have heard some quotes that come from the collation of that survey

 and research.  The full text of that Report, A Snapshot of Youth 2002 is

 available at www.nicolaroxonmp.com

 Through this type of initiative Labor is trying to engage young people

 more actively.  We are looking ahead, trying to excite young people,

 exploring changing demographic trends and looking for the right policy

 areas to develop.

 But Labor also has a defensive role to play.

 I can’t let tonight pass without registering my extreme concern at a piece

 of Howard government legislation which is currently before the

 Parliament.  The proposal eliminates the 7 day period between the calling

 of an election and the closing of the electoral roll.

 It is undeniable that a smaller window disenfranchises younger voters

 disproportionately.  Younger voters obviously move house more

 frequently.  It is harder for them to keep their enrolment details up-to-date.  And of course, first-time voters make up the overwhelming

 majority of new entrants onto the electoral roll.

 The harder you make it to register or change your enrolment details, the

 more young Australians you disenfranchise.  Yet the conservative parties

 have always been keen to close the window.  And the reason for this of

 course is that younger voters are assumed to vote in larger numbers for

 Labor.  Long may this continue, but in a democracy surely political

 parties should aspire to attract groups of voters by improving their

 policies, not by pushing those who may disagree with them off the

 electoral roll?

 Remarkably, even the ever cautious and neutral Electoral Commission

 felt it could not remain silent on this Liberal policy.  It has commented on

 it, and I quote:  “Of particular concern is the possible impact of the early

 close of rolls on young people who wish to take up their franchise for the

 first time but are usually only motivated to do so by the announcement of

 an election”.

 The Commission estimates some 80,000 to 100,000 people -

 overwhelmingly young voters - enrol for the first time in the week

 following an election being called.

 As I said, legislation proposing this unfair policy is before the Parliament

 right now.  But I also mention it because we have here tonight my

 parliamentary colleague Chris Pyne who was the architect, as chair of the

 Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, of this legislation.   So

 I’m very much hoping he’s here tonight with a quick and painless mea

 culpa to announce the withdrawal of this legislation.  That would be good

 news for young voters, and Labor would support it into the bargain.  How

 about it Chris?

 I believe this is just one indication of how the Government is missing the

 mark with young people.  Even after two elections with the GST, our

 survey showed it up as still being at the forefront of young people’s

 minds.  Removing the GST was the issue that came up most often when

 young people were asked what they would do if they were PM for a day.

 15 year old Renee from West Sunshine puts it like this - “ I would roll

 back the GST because I think it is unfair for teenagers because most of us

 have no income and have to pay more for goods and services and get no

 benefits from it.”  They rely on services, and many of their costs were

 affected - transport, books, movies, take away food, sport - with most

 young people getting none of the elusive trade offs offered.

 Other issues that ranked high on what young people would do if they

 were PM were:

 â¢ fix poverty

 â¢ increase (or reduce) the number of refugees

 â¢ improve the environment and

 â¢ increase education spending

 After this top five, young people would create employment, help the

 homeless and seek world peace. All not a bad starting point!

 The Snapshot Report has helped Labor identify some areas for future

 work on youth policy.  These include:

 â¢ Assessing of ways to relieve financial pressures on young people

 â¢ Investigating ways to more actively respond to young people’s

 recreational, sport and music interests

 â¢ Addressing their personal safety and driver safety concerns

 â¢ Considering a commitment to a free, universal year 12 equivalent

 â¢ Re-examining the traineeship regime and what it is delivering

 â¢ Providing greater consumer protection, financial management and

 debt counselling for young people.

 Let’s look briefly at the recreation and sport example.  An overwhelming

 60% of young respondents listed sport as one of their three favourite

 activities, socialising was at 48%, music and dancing next at 28%.

 Computers, shopping, TV, movies, families and cooking rated between

 15%-5%.  Perhaps as “past-times” we have regarded these as fairly

 predictable but I think we should not dismiss them as “non-political”

 issues.  If we do I suspect we could be ignoring them at our peril.  At the

 very least, they are clearly a hook into capturing many young people’s

 interest or attention.

 Furthermore, I believe we need to do more work to examine the link

 between sport (and other recreation) and the prevention of anti-social

 behaviour later in life.  If the provision of adequate recreation facilities is

 a preventative tool, maybe public investment is worth it for the safe and

 happy development of our children growing into adulthood.   Our interest

 in urban planning and community development may also tie in here.

 It is our obligation as policy makers and advocates to explore the links

 between young people’s interests and some of the areas perplexing us like

 crime, drug abuse or self harm.  We need to use young people’s issues

 and make the appropriate connections.

 We can see a changing landscape for politics in the 21st century and as a

 Party determined to take a leading role in that landscape, Labor must be

 prepared to look at what needs changing in our own backyard as well as

 what is changing in the world around us - if we neglect either of these

 tasks, there are great risks for us in the future.

 As an alternate government (in contrast to single issue parties) Labor

 must have policies for the whole nation and be able to govern for the

 whole nation.

 My argument is that young people, new voters and the next generation,

 deserve as much attention, specific thought and inclusion in our planning

 and policies (and in our Party) as any other section of the community.

 Thank you.
