 Gary Hardgrave MP   Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs 

   Media Release H94/2003 - 27 July 2003

 

 Guide to Help Migrants Understand Australian Law Available in Eight Languages 

 A new internet initiative will help migrants understand Australian law and the role of police,  the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, said today. 

 Mr Hardgrave announced a guide to help newly arrived migrants understand their rights and  responsibilities under Australian law would be available on the internet in eight languages. 

 "This guide will help engender confidence in all Australians particularly those recently arrived  of the need to work with the police," Mr Hardgrave said. 

 "It is vital that new migrants and refugees are provided with information on Australia's  policing processes and fundamental legal concepts, as they often arrive from countries with  vastly different legal systems and standards," Mr Hardgrave said.

 "This is a practical, informative guide that outlines the criminal justice system in Australia,  provides a list of emergency service contact numbers, and highlights avenues of action for  victims of crime." 

 "Many recently arrived migrants may not be reporting crime because of a variety of cultural  reasons."

 A Guide to the Role of Police in Australia was developed by the Australasian Police  Multicultural Advisory Bureau, with funding assistance from the Commonwealth  Government's Living in Harmony initiative.

 Produced in English, Arabic, Afghani (Dari), Bosnian, Chinese (Mandarin), Persian (Farsi),  Somali and Vietnamese the guide is now available in PDF form from the Australasian Police  Multicultural Advisory Bureau web site in all eight languages at  http://www.apmab.gov.au/pubs/PoliceGuide.html

 Mr Hardgrave said the guide was an excellent example of the commitment of Australia's  State and Territory police forces to the delivery of culturally appropriate, customer oriented  services to all Australians.

 "Strengthening relations between police, and culturally and linguistically diverse  communities is an important step towards ensuring that the needs of multicultural Australia  are met, and that community harmony continues to be achieved," Mr Hardgrave said.
