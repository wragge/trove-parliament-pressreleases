  Statement from Senator Hanson-Young regarding the  incident on Christmas Island  

 06 December 2013 | Sarah Hansen-Young 

 Please find a statement below from Senator Hanson-Young regarding the incident on Christmas 

 Island. 

 

 “The coconut telegraph is running hot with information from Christmas Island, showing just how  ridiculous the government’s obsession with secrecy is,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson,  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said. 

 “We’ve heard more from Christmas Island residents today than we have from our own government. 

 “The fact that this boat arrived and then crashed without anyone realising raises questions about the  capacity of search and rescue operations that have been seriously compromised in recent weeks. 

 “Nothing, however, will hide the fact that Operation Secret Boats is a sham that is putting lives at  risk. 

 “Further reports of this week’s third and fourth boats arriving in previous days, combined with this  crash on the coast of the island, show that Operation Secret Boats is a failure.”
