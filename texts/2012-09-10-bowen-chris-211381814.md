 MEDIA RELEASE

 AUSTRALIA WELCOMES ESTABLISHMENT OF REGIONAL  SUPPORT OFFICE   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, today welcomed the official  launch of the Regional Support Office in Bangkok, Thailand, as a key step in the  implementation of the Bali Process Regional Cooperation Framework and the region’s efforts  to tackle people smuggling.   

 “The Australian Government recognises that we need a truly regional approach to irregular  migration, and the establishment of the Regional Support Office (RSO) is an important  practical measure in strengthening cooperation to address this complex issue,” Mr Bowen  said.   

 “The Government has committed $5.2 million over four years to fund the set-up and  ongoing operation of the RSO, as well as $2.7 million in funding for projects to be run  through the office.   

 “It is fitting that in the year of the 10th anniversary of the Bali Process, we have made  substantial progress in preventing people from risking their lives at sea through such  regional cooperation,” Mr Bowen said.   

 The RSO will involve the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the  International Organization for Migration, as well as Australia, Indonesia, Thailand and other  members of the Bali Process.   

 Mr Bowen reaffirmed the Government’s commitment to tackling people smuggling and noted  that the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers supported the Regional Cooperation Framework as  fundamental to shaping policy on asylum seeker issues.   

 “The Expert Panel’s report stated that a suite of measures is needed to address this issue  and the Government continues to work to implement its recommendations,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “In line with the Expert Panel’s recommendations, the Government has recently taken the  significant steps of immediately increasing the humanitarian intake to 20,000 places in 2012-

 13 and allocated $10 million for regional capacity building projects with a special emphasis  on UNHCR.”
