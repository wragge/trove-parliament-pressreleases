 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 35 boats and almost 2,500 people so far this  month April 24, 2013

 Another two illegal boat arrivals have been intercepted, carrying almost 200 passengers, as ASIO’s security assessment  program struggles to cope with this unprecedented rate of arrivals, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and  Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “This month the record breaking numbers continue with 35 boats carrying almost 2500 people having arrived so far this  month - far more than double the amount of people that arrived in April last year,” Mr Keenan said.

 “The sheer volume of boat arrivals is creating security concerns amidst revelations that an accused terrorist, a suspected  murderer and an alleged drug trafficker were being housed in low security and community detention facilities.

 “It is very difficult for our security agencies to make an accurate assessment about who it is that has arrived here when  they are not only dealing with record breaking numbers of arrivals but are also doing it with less funding.

 “Labor cut almost $7 million in funding from the very program that ASIO has to conduct its security assessments program  on irregular maritime arrivals.

 “Given that most people arrive without identity documents, this creates significant risks that people of poor character could  be released into the community on bridging visas.

 “Labor’s inability to protect our borders is creating significant national security risks that would not exist if we had  successful policies to stop people smuggling,” Mr Keenan said.
