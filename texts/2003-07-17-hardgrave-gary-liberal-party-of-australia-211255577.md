   Media Release H88/2003 - 17 July 2003

 

 New Contracts for Migrant English Language Tuition in Victoria

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, today announced the  awarding of contracts worth around $18.5 million that will provide English language tuition to  over 25,000 migrants and refugees in Victoria in the next five years. 

 The contracts were awarded to the Victorian Adult Multicultural Education Services (AMES)  and its six consortium partners. 

 Mr Hardgrave said AMES Victoria led another consortium back in 1998 and were the first  service providers to win an AMEP contract through the tender process.

 'This contract will enable the consortium to deliver English language tuition to migrants and  refugees from more than 140 countries and 120 language backgrounds,' Mr Hardgrave said.

 Mr Hardgrave said that by again entering into a consortium arrangement, AMES Victoria and  its partners would enable the AMEP to retain a close connection with the local communities. 

 'Such depth of provision will do much to facilitate the AMEP's reach to its very diverse client  base,' Mr Hardgrave said.

 Nationally, the Federal Government has allocated more than $500 million over the next five  years to the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP), including $114 million this financial  year.

 Mr Hardgrave said that the new contracts with AMEP service providers in each state and  territory would help more than 100,000 new arrivals settle successfully in Australia.

 'The Adult Migrant English Program is a vital component of the Government's commitment to  'nation building,' community harmony and cohesion,' Mr Hardgrave said. 

 'It represents a significant investment by the Commonwealth in ensuring that new arrivals  have every opportunity to learn our national language, and so take the first and most  important step towards full participation in Australian society.'

 While in Melbourne, the Minister also conducted settlement consultations on the  implementation of the Review of Settlement Services for Migrants and Humanitarian  Entrants.

 'This review has been invaluable in providing a clearer picture of what needs to be done to  better meet the needs of newly arrived migrants and refugees,' Mr Hardgrave said.
