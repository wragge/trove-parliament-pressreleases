 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Tuesday, 18 February 2014   

 One dead, shots fired, lives under threat; close  Manus now   

 The Australian Greens have called for the closure of the Manus Island detention centre after the  tragic news that a refugee has been killed in an incident at the Australian run camp.   

 “The centre must be closed, and it must be closed now,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson,  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “This gulag on Manus Island is untenable.   

 “We express our deepest sympathies for those who have been affected by this tragic incident  including the Australian staff, the people who were being held there and the family of the  refugee who has been killed.   

 “Scott Morrison’s attempts to blame the victims of this incident are sickening.   

 “Responsibility for this policy failure falls directly at the feet of the Abbott Government and the  Immigration Minister.   

 “The Government was warned about the toxic environment on Manus Island repeatedly by organisations  like Amnesty International and the UN but those warnings were ignored and dismissed.”
