 Strong social safety net must be part of economic management - Bartlett launches  Welfare Protection platform

 The Queensland Democrats have called for the gap to be bridged between the 'haves' and 'have nots'  with the launch of their Protecting Australiaâ€™s Welfare election platform.    

 "At a time of such great economic prosperity, it is disgraceful that we are seeing more and more  Australians slipping through the cracks and being forced into poverty," Senator Bartlett said.    

 "During the last decade under a Coalition government the cracks have gotten wider. Government must  realise that poverty isn't just a problem of individuals; it's one that affects our society as a whole.    

 "Groups such as single parents, veterans, carers, and people with a disability, those with a mental  illness, the long-term unemployed, Indigenous Australians, migrants and refugees are disproportionately  represented in the poverty statistics. These groups mustn't be allowed to continue to be a statistic of an  economically rich but socially impoverished government approach to welfare.   

 "The Democrats are calling for the reform of areas that impact on people's ability to fully engage in  society so that they can remain out of the poverty cycle. Areas in urgent need of reform are:   

 Welfare to Work. The government's so-called 'welfare to work' measures are an immoral and dishonest  attack on some of the most vulnerable people in society. Cutting people's income does not help them get  a job. We need to restore previous income support payments for sole parents and people with a  disability, and invest more into programs and support measures such as education, training, counselling  and child-care assistance.    

 The tax system. We believe this must be fairer, simpler and more effective. We advocate lifting the tax-free threshold to $10,000, addressing bracket creep, reducing capital gains tax discounts and reforming  the intersection between the tax and social security systems.   

 Workplace relations. We believe those with little bargaining power must be protected and that  WorkChoices must be reformed. This must include the reintroduction of fair features of the pre-WorkChoice regime, introducing a National Regulator, restoring a strong independent Industrial  Relations Commission and providing a genuine safety net for workers.    

 "Such measures are workable and viable alternatives for any government to pursue. The Democrats will  work with either side of politics to ensure that fairness and balance is returned to our welfare system and  that the strongest possible welfare protection is put in place," Senator Bartlett concluded.
