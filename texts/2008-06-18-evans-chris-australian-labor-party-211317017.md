 Grants to help refugees with citizenship test 

 Wednesday 18 June 2008 

 The Australian Government will provide $3.4 million in grants to help refugees and  other people who require special assistance prepare for the Australian citizenship  test, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, announced  during Refugee Week. 

 Senator Evans said the Citizenship Support Grants Program will provide funding for  33 community-based organisations across Australia, including migrant resource  centres, English language service providers and technical and further education  (TAFE) bodies. 

 'These organisations will offer a range of services to support up to 35 000 people  who may have difficulty in undertaking the computer-based citizenship test,' Senator  Evans said. 

 The Citizenship Support Grants Program will deliver a range of services in 2008-09  on a pilot basis including: 

 â¢ advice and explanation of the responsibilities  and privileges of Australian citizenship,  Australian values, traditions, history and  national symbols including assistance in other  languages where English language proficiency  is poor  

 â¢ basic computer lessons to help people gain  required proficiency to sit the test   â¢ assistance to people to book in for the test and  produce the required documentation   â¢ advice on the process for conferral of citizenship 

 once the test is passed.  

 'The services will help refugees and other people overcome disadvantages such as  low English proficiency, a lack of formal education, difficulty performing within a  formal testing regime and little or no experience with computers,' Senator Evans  said. 

 The most recent snapshot report of the Australian citizenship test shows more than  25 000 people sat the test in the six months between October 2007 and March 2008. 

 However, there was a marked difference in the pass rate between migrants who  came to Australia on work or family visas and those who came under the  humanitarian program. 

 In the first six months of the test, 82 per cent of citizenship applicants who came as  refugees or under the humanitarian program passed the test compared to 99 per  cent of skilled migrants and 91 per cent of family migrants. 

 'This means that about one in five of the test candidates who most need our support  are yet to pass the test,' Senator Evans said. 

 'It is important that all eligible applicants are on an equal footing when seeking  Australian citizenship, especially those who have come to Australia as refugees. 

 'This program, which was initially funded by the previous government, will assist in  encouraging refugees to take the test and not to view it in any way as a threat to  their place within Australia. 

 'The Rudd Government is committed to the citizenship test and is confident that it  has a valuable role to play in preparing people for citizenship.' 

 An independent committee of seven eminent Australians is currently reviewing the  operation and effectiveness of the citizenship test since its introduction on October 1  last year.  

 Committee chairman, Richard Woolcott AC, said the committee supported an  educative approach to citizenship. 

 'The Committee endorses the broad principles of the grants program,' Mr Woolcott  said. 

 'We recognise that it is important that any current applicants have support to prepare  for the current test, particularly in the context that any recommendations made by the  Committee will take time to implement.  

 'As the program is a pilot, it does not pre-empt or limit any recommendations the  Committee may make in relation to the Citizenship Test.'

 A list of organisations selected to provide citizenship test assistance services in  2008-09 is available on the department's website.  See: www.immi.gov.au/living-in-australia/delivering-assistance/citizenship-support-grants/index.htm
