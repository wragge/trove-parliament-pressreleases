 TRANSCRIPT

 THE HON PETER COSTELLO MP Treasurer

 Doorstop Melbourne

 Wednesday, 30 January 2002 10.30 am

 SUBJECTS: Cost of unauthorised arrivals; Ansett

 JOURNALIST:

 Treasurer, there's been a report today that the Immigration Department is looking for an extra $1.8 billion to deal with security and immigration issues at the moment. Is that the true indication of the cost that it is taking for refugees?

 TREASURER:

 No. I saw reports in the newspapers today about the so-called additional costs. And they're wildly inaccurate these figures. It could even be that somebody's given false information to the journalist concerned or they could be wish lists that are coming out of Canberra departments. But I can assure you that the cost is nothing like that. And the additional estimates, when we present them will show that the costs are being restrained. The Government is insisting that the taxpayer get value for money and we certainly won't be writing blank cheques in relation to these Departments or any others.

 JOURNALIST:

 With, what was the, do you have an estimated cost for last year, or how much you expect it to cost you this year? I mean, you must have some sort of a ballpark figure, but obviously it will go up and down depending on how many boats continue to arrive.

 TREASURER:

 Yes.

 JOURNALIST:

 But I mean what are we looking at?

 TREASURER:

 Well we said at the time of the Mid Year Review that in addition to the normal Budget allocation for unauthorised boat arrivals, the fact that the smuggling activity is being increased, and the fact that we've had more arrivals than expected at the time of the Mid Year Review, meant that the additional cost was more than $100 million. That's over and above the normal Budget cost. The outcome for the year will depend on whether or not the smugglers are successful getting more people in. But the good news is, that there seems to have been success in the policy over the last couple of months, the number of boats in the last couple of months, the number of boats in the last couple of months has dropped. And if we can maintain our strong presence against the smugglers then we can restrain any additional costs.

 JOURNALIST:

 Traditionally this time of year is quiet for boat people because it's the monsoon season. Do you think that, I mean you're saying that your policy has been successful, how can you be sure of that if it is generally a downtime this time of year?

 TREASURER:

 It looks over the last couple of months as if the level of smuggling activity has reduced. And there haven't been new boat arrivals in the last couple of months, and in fact some boats have been turned away. It's not always quiet this time of the year. In some previous years there have been boats arriving at this particular time. Now, the good news is, that the smuggling activity seems to have reduced in the last couple of months. That doesn't mean that we can let up, or that we can relax. We have to remain vigilant. And the extent to which we can intercept the smuggling activity, is the extent to which we can keep the costs down. But I can assure the taxpayers of this, that if Canberra Departments are positioning for more money, they will be properly funded to do their duty, but we will be running a very tough line over their expenditures, and make sure that they account for all of the money that they wish to expend. But they won't be getting anything like the figures that were floated by journalists this morning in the paper.

 JOURNALIST:

 How inflated is that $1.8 billion? I mean it's a lot of money. So, I mean, how far out are they from what you are intending to spend?

 TREASURER:

 Wildly inflated. It's a wildly inaccurate figure.

 JOURNALIST:

 ...Ansett? Just that at the creditors meeting yesterday, I mean, were you happy with the outcome and the way that it was going, I mean, there are 4,000 jobs depending on this?

 TREASURER:

 Well I hope that the new Ansett does get up and running. I think that would be a good thing for competition. I think it would be a good thing for the employees that are concerned. I think it would be a good thing also for creditors who are still expecting to receive some repayment for the monies that they're owed. And so I wish the new syndicate every success, and I hope that the travelling public gets some full-blooded competition which can go to providing additional services and lower costs.

 JOURNALIST:

 Did you expect it to take this long for Ansett to (inaudible) or are you surprised that it's been (inaudible)?

 TREASURER:

 Well, look it's a very big administration. It's very complicated and very big and you don't do these things quickly or easily. Let's hope that it's brought to an early conclusion.

 Thanks.
