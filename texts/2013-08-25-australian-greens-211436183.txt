 GREENS COMPASSIONATE REFUGEE PLAN WILL SAVE BILLIONS   

 The Australian Greens have released costing details of their election policy on asylum seekers which  will save taxpayers $3.2 billion over the next four years.    

 New costings from the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) have revealed that allowing asylum  seekers to live in the community and earn a living will result in significant savings of almost a billion  dollars. Further savings will come from ending expensive offshore and remote detention.   

 Today’s announcement comes as Julian Burnside AO QC flies to Adelaide to endorse Immigration  spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson-Young and the Greens’ refugee policy.     

 “I am delighted that Julian Burnside, one of Australia’s most respected human rights and refugee  advocates, is supporting Senator Hanson-Young and the Greens’ compassionate plan for refugees,”  Greens Leader Senator Christine Milne said.    

 “Refugees have long been our nation’s chief political football, but this election we’ve hit new lows.   

 “In the race to cruelty, the old parties are wasting billions of dollars. Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott are  burning cash on harsh punishment for innocent and desperate people that could be spent on helping  single parents out of poverty or supporting students at universities.   

 “Cruelty in the pursuit of power shames us all. It drags down our international standing. It demeans  us as a people but I know Australians are better than this.   

 “That’s why the Greens are saying enough is enough and standing up for a better way. Our plan will  put people before politics. We will care for refugees and save money in the process.   

 “I haven’t seen such an outpouring of shock, disgust and anger towards the atrocious, cruel and  expensive policies of Labor and the Coalition since the Tampa crisis.”   

 The Greens’ immigration spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said that economic savings  were just one of the many advantages of the party’s refugee policy.   

 “Australia’s international reputation is being tarnished by the old parties and their obsession with  cruelty,” Senator Hanson-Young said.   

 “While the Labor Party wants to lock children up on Nauru and Tony Abbott wants to set fire to  boats in Indonesia, the Greens are offering a considered, evidence based approach.   

 “Increasing funding to the UN in Indonesia, so that they can actually process people’s claims, and  increasing our humanitarian intake would offer people a safer way to reach safety while caring for  refugees.   

 “Australia’s generous heart is under attack from the old parties. If people want to see the Australia  return to a humane and reasonable refugee policy they have only one choice; vote Green.” Senator  Hanson-Young concluded.   

 The Greens policy would:   

 â¢ Set 30 day time limit in onshore detention for health, security and ID checks, before allowing  refugees to live in the community on a bridging visas with work rights 

 â¢ Close down offshore detention in Nauru and Papua New Guinea (PNG)  â¢ Close down remote and expensive centres on mainland  â¢ Increase Australia’s humanitarian intake to 30,000 people per year   

 The plan would takes effect 1st January 2014.

 Australia’s notorious practice of indefinite mandatory detention  is causing serious damage to vulnerable people who have  already suffered trauma and persecution. By deporting refugees  to inadequate facilities in Manus Island and Nauru, or stranding  families in detention and in poverty here in Australia, we are  failing the Australian spirit of fairness and compassion.   

 While the old parties compete to punish people in harsh  detention camps, Australian taxpayers are footing a multi-billion  dollar bill.  Only the Greens are standing up for better, cheaper  and more humane policies to save lives and care for refugees.   

 > CLOSE DOWN CRUEL DETENTION TO  SAVE MONEY AND PROTECT HEALTH  Deterrents, including expensive and cruel detention centres in  Australia or overseas, have never been effective to stop  refugees arriving by boat. In fact, mandatory detention has  never actually worked as a ‘deterrent’ since it was first  established by the Labor Party in 1992.

 i  

 

 The current detention regime supported by both the old parties  is founded on the plundering of foreign aid, the punitive  incarceration of people who have committed no crime, and the  re-traumatising of an already damaged generation of people.   

 It is also massively expensive, with the combined costs of  Gillard’s ‘no advantage’ visa freeze and Rudd’s offshore  deportation plan already rising above $8 billion across the  forward estimates.

 ii  

 

 The Parliamentary Budget Office has indicated that the average  cost of allowing someone to live in the general community is  $35 000; compared to $225 000 to detain a person on Manus  Island or Nauru.    

 The costs of detention are not just financial; Australia’s  international reputation, foreign aid goals, legal integrity and, 

 most importantly, the lives of many vulnerable people are also  at stake.    

 The Greens’ plan treats refugees with humanity saves  Australia $3.2 billion over the forward estimates. Our plan will: 

 ï· Close down offshore detention on Manus Island and Nauru. 

 ï· Close down the worst Australian detention centres on the  mainland and on Christmas Island. 

 ï· Establish 30 day time limits on detention in Australia so  initial health, security and ID checks can be done, and periodic  judicial review of any detention thereafter. 

 ï· Refugees to live in the community as soon as possible.  

 ï· Give full work rights to refugees and asylum seekers on  bridging visas so they can support themselves where possible. 

 ï· Fair rate of assistance for those in the community who are  unable to work. 

 Under the Greens’ fully costed plan, Australia would be treating  refugees with compassion and fairness while saving taxpayers  $3.2 billion.    

 The costing by the Parliamentary Budget Office provides a  breakdown of savings as follows: 

 ï· $827 million saved by closing down offshore detention camps  in PNG. 

 ï· $970 million saved from closing down offshore detention  camps in Nauru. 

 ï· $925 million saved by having people live in the community  rather than be locked up in detention. 

 ï· $81 million saved by not building the two new detention  centres announced by the Rudd government. iii  

 ï· $366 million saved by closing down remote onshore  detention centres including Curtain, Scherger, Wickham Point,  Northern and North West Point on Christmas Island. 

 CARING FOR REFUGEES IN OUR COMMUNITY  HUMANE, PRACTICAL, SAVING LIVES   Ending the cruel detention of refugees in Australia, PNG and Nauru 

 Detaining refugees and their children in cruel offshore  camps or in harsh centres in Australia is expensive and  deeply harmful. Long-term detention causes mental ill-health and wastes the lives of people who are fleeing  persecution. There is a better way.

 > CRUEL MANDATORY INDEFINTE  DETENTION MUST END  To our shame, Australia is the only OECD country that imposes  indefinite mandatory detention on refugees.

 iv  We know full well 

 how harmful detention is to refugees and especially children.   Mental ill-health, self-harm and suicide attempts are sad and  constant features of long-term detention, whether it is in  Australia, PNG or Nauru.  

 Amnesty International has noted that a 30 day time-limit on  detention is broadly comparable with other countries. v  Many 

 other legal experts and organisations have long made it clear  that indefinite detention is not legally justified. vi    

 The Greens have been resolutely standing up in Parliament and  around Australia for reasonable and safe time-limits on  detention, including moving amendments to the Government’s  offshore processing legislation in 2012 which were voted down  by both the old parties. 

 > CLOSE THE WORST AND REMOTE  AUSTRALIAN DETENTION CENTRES   Detention centres in remote places around Australia are seen by  many to be ‘factories for mental illness’.  These centres are very  expensive to run and extremely isolated.  The remote centres  are notoriously unattractive to trained staff, impractical for  supplying goods, and removed from the reach of compassionate  Australians, whose regular visits currently help refugees in  metropolitan detention centres keep hopeful and healthy.  

 It is also hard for refugees in remote centres to access legal  advice, excursions and medical care.  The Green’s plan closes  the most expensive and damaging of the remote centres, and  leaves open or on standby enough metropolitan centres to deal  with the current backlog and cater for the requirements of non-humanitarian short-term immigration detention.  

 > CHILDREN SHOULD NEVER BE IN  DETENTION   Imprisoning children in detention is a violation of their rights.   As a starting point, children should never be in detention in  Australia or any country, except for the absolute minimum  period to complete basic health checks, and even then, it should  be accommodation which is child-appropriate and not in  mandatory detention centres. 

 For years, successive Labor and Coalition governments have  been locking children up in detention where they are witnessing  serious trauma, self-harm and despair, and often experiencing  these things themselves. It is impossible to equip detention  centres in Australia, and especially detention camps in Manus  Island and Nauru, with appropriate education and paediatric 

 care that children require. Even the Labor Government had to  bring back all the children it cast off to Manus Island in late 2012  within a year, because conditions were so appalling and  damaging to children despite the billions that were poured into  that camp.   

 The Greens are the only party standing up for the rights of the  child and proposing an approach in which no child grows up  behind bars or fences. 

 > WORK RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE ON  BRIDGING VISAS   Right now there are thousands of families living in destitution in  the Australian community because the ‘no advantage’  allowance is so meagre and they are banned from working for a  living and contributing to the Australian economy.  

 The Greens’ policy to allow people to work would lead to  healthier lifestyles as people wait for their claims to be  assessed, and take the pressure off thinly-stretched charities  and non-government organisations.  It would also save the  public purse. Most of the refugees who come to Australia by  boat come from skilled trades and professions. They are keen to  make a contribution to Australia.  

 Without the right to work, refugees living in the community face  very harsh conditions and poor mental health.  In utter  desperation they could be exposed to exploitation and harm on  the illegal job market. 

 People waiting for their claims to be assessed in the community  who are unable to work should receive fair assistance. Keeping  people in destitution on 89% of Newstart is punishing people for  having sought Australia’s protection from persecution.
