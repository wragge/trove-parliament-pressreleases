 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/781 FRIDAY 20 AUGUST 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS AND SPOKESPERSON ON IMMIGRATION  Poll Shows Howard's Immigration Policies Out Of Date The Australian Democrats welcome today's poll in The Australian which highlights the significant shift in attitudes towards asylum seekers. Leader of the Democrats and spokesperson for Immigration, Senator Andrew Bartlett said that, "Today's poll proves that the Prime Minister's hardline anti-refugee stance in the 2001 election is obsolete." This week's revelations by senior public servants have shown how far John Howard is willing to go to deceive the Australian public and the media. Less than a month after the Children Overboard lie, the Howard Government was re-elected. "This significant change in public sentiment demonstrates a major backlash against Howard‘s lies, deceptions and heartless policies. "In the face of this change in public opinion, the Democrats renew our calls to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration for the release of all asylum-seekers who are currently detained, and pose no health or security risk. "The Government’s policy of locking up children and their families is reprehensible. The prolonged detention of children amounts to 'Government-sanctioned child abuse'. The Government justifies its abuse of children by saying it deters people smugglers, but no policy that causes suffering to children is justifiable. "I have met with detained people, assessed the conditions they face and heard their concerns," said Senator Bartlett who has visited every detention centre in Australia and Nauru and is the only federal politician to visit Nauru twice.  “Democrat Senators have campaigned against mandatory detention, the 45 day rule which deprives asylum seekers access to social security or work rights, temporary protection visas, restrictions in access to courts and the Pacific Solution.  “We have worked for equal rights and opportunities for asylum seekers and refugees, advocating that welcoming and supporting refugees will bring long term benefits to the Australian community."
