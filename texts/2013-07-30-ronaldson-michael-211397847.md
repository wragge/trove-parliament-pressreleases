 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It is terrific to be here in the Seaford RSL with the local member Bruce Billson and Shadow Minister for  small business; with Senator Michael Ronaldson, the Shadow Minister for Veterans; with Stuart Robert, the  Shadow Minister for Defence Personnel to confirm the Coalition's commitment to veterans. We will ensure  in our first Budget, if we are elected, that Defence Force pensions are properly indexed. This is a long  overdue act of justice for our veterans. It is an act of justice which was promised by Kevin Rudd back in  2007 and never delivered. The Party you can trust to deliver justice to veterans is the Party which has been  trying all the last term of Parliament to deliver justice to veterans. We have been thwarted at every step of  the way by the current Government. If we are elected, we will put this policy into place in our first Budget  and finally ensure that people on the DFRB and DFRDB get the indexation justice they deserve.    

 It is interesting that we have had an announcement from the Government today on this subject. Yet again,  the Government is attempting to address the political disasters, the policy disasters which it has created.  Whether it is on boats, whether it is on corruption inside the Labor Party, whether it is on the carbon tax,  whether it’s on the economy, Kevin Rudd is attempting to put in place pre-election fixes that he will never,  ever deliver upon. What each one of these pre-election fixes does, it confirms the validity of the Coalition's  criticisms.    

 Now who do you want to govern the country? Do you want someone who is fair dinkum?  Do you want  someone who actually believes in these things? Or do you want someone who believes in anything and  nothing but just promises to do things when he is desperate before an election? Well I think the Australian  people know this Coalition, they know this Labor Party, they know who they can trust and the last thing I  expect from the Australian people is to see them fooled by the same bloke with the same tricks twice. I am  going to ask Ronno and Stu to speak briefly and obviously we will take some questions. So Michael, over to  you first.

 MICHAEL RONALDSON:   

 Well thank you very much, Tony. Can I thank you on behalf of the veterans community for your personal  involvement in this policy that you have been driving through the Party room. I thank you most sincerely.  Today, veterans have a very clear choice between a fair indexation policy - an Abbott-led Coalition  government fair indexation policy - or an unfair indexation policy, remarkably launched not by the  appropriate minister today but by Dr Mark Kelly. Today's announcement is a pale imitation of the Coalition  policy. It doesn't include MTAWE; it is only for those over 65. If this is a desperate attempt to keep Mike  Kelly in Eden Monaro, then it has been an abject failure and it should be judged very harshly by an ex-service community that is looking for fair indexation and passionately supports the Coalition's position.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Stuart?    

 STUART ROBERT:   

 Thanks Tony. Today's announcement by the Government, by Mike Kelly in Eden Monaro was half-baked. It  is in line with so much that the Government has done in Defence, it is half-baked, which is why we are  launching today the little book of Labor's Defence back flips that goes through 30 of their disastrous  decisions, from cutting $25 billion out of the Defence budget to knocking cadets around, to failing to deal  with Defence indexation for pensions for six years and then coming up with a half-baked solution. It goes  through disaster after disaster. When you compare that to the Coalition's solutions, our plan, you can see  clearly that one side of politics led by Tony Abbott has a plan. The other side of politics has a litany of  absolute disasters.   

 Thanks Tony.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Do we have any questions?    

 QUESTION:   

 On the Defence indexing, the Government says their new plan today at the age of 65, being the threshold, it  will cost $34 million over the forward estimates, how much will your plan cost?    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 We will release the full costing in good time before the election. This is the policy that we took to the last  election which we reconfirmed today. It costs just a whisker over $100 million at the last election. That  costing wasn't disputed by Treasury and we expect, with a small adjustment, that again will be the costing  over the forward estimates.   

 QUESTION:   

 Tony Abbott, on your new Nauru plan, will it be possible for any of those refugees if they get asylum to  actually be resettled in Australia?    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 What we are going to do is stop the boats. Nauru is an important element, it is not the only element but it is  an important element in stopping the boats. We have been absolutely consistent for well over a decade, for  well over a decade. The Coalition's clear policy to stop the boats has involved rigorous offshore processing

 at places like Nauru, temporary protection visas to deny the people smugglers a product to sell and the  willingness to turn boats around where it is safe to do so.    

 So, what we are saying today is that because of the crisis on our borders that Kevin Rudd created because he  wasn't man enough to leave well enough alone back in 2008, we would be prepared to rapidly ramp up the  capacity of Nauru to 2,000 and beyond. That is what we are saying. We would expect as many as possible to  be resettled in third countries, as happened under the Howard Government.   

 QUESTION:   

 Kevin Rudd is clear on his plan that no-one sent to PNG will be resettled in Australia. What’s happening  with regards to your Nauru plan?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 With respect, the arrangements between Mr Rudd and Prime Minister O'Neill do not say that. Mr Rudd has  misled the Australian people. He has been misleading to the point of dishonesty. Nowhere in the skimpy  two-page document released a week or so back by Mr Rudd does it say: a) that everyone coming to  Australia will go to PNG and b) that no-one going to PNG will ever come to Australia. So Mr Rudd is being  dishonest.   

 QUESTION:    

 Isn't the Government sending a stronger message? You’re saying that there is no guarantee that they will  be…   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Laura, please. Please Laura. You are talking about a Prime Minister who closed down the Pacific Solution,  and because of Mr Rudd's unwillingness to leave well enough alone, we’ve got almost 50,000 illegal arrivals  by boat, almost 800 boats, tragically more than 1,000 drownings at sea, $10 billion plus in border protection  blowouts and you are saying that their policy is serious. Come on, Laura. Come on. Look at Mr Rudd's  record. This is a guy who is great at promising, he’s hopeless at delivering. Absolutely hopeless at delivering  and please Laura, you can't let this Prime Minister get away with this kind of posturing. Judge him by his  actions. When it comes to the actions, he has tried everything under the sun, none of it has worked. He has  had every position and no position on everything.   

 QUESTION:   

 Can I ask about the Nauru places that you detailed though and Scott Morrison has detailed, is it the wrong  message to send that you will have 2,000 places or 5,000 places? Is it a mistake to give that goal for people  smugglers to work towards, if you like?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, the interesting thing is that almost two years after Kevin Rudd said, after the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd  Government said that there would be processing at Manus, there is still only a capacity of 300 at that centre.  What we’ve said is that we are prepared to expand offshore processing facilities to whatever number we  need, to whatever number we need, because our will is stronger than that of the people smugglers.   

 QUESTION:   

 The Nauru plan, was that given the full consideration of Shadow Cabinet?

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, it doesn't need that consideration because it is existing policy. It is our existing policy to have offshore  processing at Nauru and to process as many people as we need to at Nauru, Manus and elsewhere.   

 QUESTION:   

 So how much will the tent policy cost and is that policy an admission that turning back the boats won’t  work?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I can tell you this: that our policy will be vastly less expensive than Labor’s policy because Labor’s policy  has already cost us more than $10 billion in border protection blowouts. Now, the cheapest thing to do here  is to stop the boats. That’s the cheapest thing to do. It’s the cheapest thing, it’s the best thing, it’s the most  compassionate thing to do and we will stop the boats. We’re not like Mr Rudd, putting all our eggs in one  basket. We’re not saying offshore processing on its own will do it. We’re not saying that temporary  protection visas on its own will do it. We’re not saying that turning boats around on its own will do it. We’re  not saying that one place, PNG or Nauru, on its own will do it. We are saying that we will put a range of  strong measures in place, the measures that we know from previous experience work, and we will do it with  a will and a determination and a consistency which has been completely lacking from Mr Rudd and this  Labor government.   

 QUESTION:    

 Just finally from me Tony Abbott, how did Scott Morrison pay for his trip to Nauru?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 My understanding is that the trip was wholly privately funded.   

 QUESTION:   

 Did Toll pay for it?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, it’s wholly privately funded and there’s no reason whatsoever why it shouldn’t be funded in that way.   

 QUESTION:   

 What will be the nature of the agreement with Nauru? Will it need to be detailed? Will they need to say, or  will there need to be any agreement? The number of places available, is that something that will stand up  legally and are you saying that there is a provision in there to be more than 5,000 places in [inaudible]?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 There will be memorandum of understanding with Nauru in the future, as there has been in the past. You’ve  got to remember that there is a clear contrast here between the Coalition, which knows how to stop the boats  and which did stop the boats, and a Labor government which started the boats up again and which plainly  does not know how to stop them. So look, you know, the Labor Party can brief all these lines and people  will for all sorts of reasons ask all these questions but the fact of the matter is you’ve got here a Coalition 

 5 

 

 which knows what to do and which has been completely consistent and a government which is plainly in  panic over what to do on our borders and which has had every position under the sun.   

 Thank so much.
