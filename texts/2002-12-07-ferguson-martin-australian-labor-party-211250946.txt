 ADDRESS TO RURAL AUSTRALIANS FOR REFUGEES

 ARAC SITE MUDGEE

 7 DECEMBER 2002

 Asylum Seekers and Refugees - Labor Policy

 MARTIN FERGUSON MP

 Shadow Minister for Regional Development, Transport, Infrastructure and Tourism

 On Thursday, Simon Crean and Julia Gillard released Labor’s

 policy for Asylum Seekers and Refugees.

 The policy is a complex package but it is a series of interlocking

 measures.

 It is a better way of protecting Australia and a better way of

 meeting people’s legitimate concerns about how this nation is

 treating individual asylum seekers.

 The policy addresses three important strategies - protection of

 Australia, a new processing system and treating asylum seekers

 decently.

 In relation to better protecting Australia, the policy details five

 new important steps that Labor will take.  These five steps are:

 1. Labor will introduce a US style Green Card to crack down

 on illegal workers and ensure they are not stealing

 Australian jobs and undermining the pay and conditions of

 Australians.

 2. Labor will smash onshore and offshore people smuggling

 rings through tougher policing including stationing more

 Australian Federal Police (AFP) officers in Indonesia.

 2

 3. Labor will impose harsher penalties, including million dollar

 fines, for people smugglers.

 4. Labor will focus on eradicating people trafficking for the

 purposes of sexual or other exploitation, as well as people

 smuggling.

 5. Labor will better protect our airports and seaports.

 These five steps are in addition to our recently announced $600

 million Australian Coastguard, a cop on the beat 24 hours a day,

 seven days a week.

 Together these initiatives will continue the proud Labor tradition

 of protecting Australia’s borders.

 Labor proposes a fairer worldwide refugee system by having the

 world adopt one processing system for refugee claims.

 This is about leadership.

 To lead the world requires leading by example.  Labor will:

 â¢ Maintain the excision of Christmas Island in order to pilot

 the processing regime it will advocate should be adopted

 globally.  Christmas Island will be the prime asylum seeker

 processing and detention facility;

 â¢ Put its processing regime to the ultimate test by monitoring

 the return of failed asylum seekers;

 3

 â¢ Increase funding to the UNHCR to $25 million per annum in

 order to better assist those who live and too often die in

 refugee camps overseas;

 â¢ Boost aid to address the issues that cause people to move

 such as poverty, natural disasters, conflict and

 environmental degradation;

 â¢ Increase aid to countries of first asylum.  Such aid is

 desperately needed and is important to facilitate the

 development of a system of return of asylum seekers.

 Advocating a new worldwide system is a bold step.

 We’re putting forward a unique international idea for moving the

 global protection system for refugees forward.

 That unique international idea is that the developed world

 resource UNHCR to undertake refugee determination everywhere.

 This would be the ultimate deterrent.  There will be no point in

 moving on from the country of first asylum to another.

 We understand that unauthorised boat arrivals are the worst of all

 possible worlds.

 It’s the worst of all possible worlds from Australia’s perspective in

 terms of managing our borders.

 It’s the worst of all possible worlds for the asylum seekers

 involved, because many fail in the attempt, many die trying to get

 here in leaky boats.

 4

 Labor will keep mandatory detention for the proper purposes of

 protecting Australia from health and security risks.

 Mandatory Detention will also ensure refugee claims can be dealt

 with efficiently and failed claimants removed.

 Under Labor the system of mandatory detention will be humane,

 not a system of punishment.

 Labor will end the “Pacific Solution” because it is costly,

 unsustainable and wrong as a matter of principle.

 Labor has already announced that it will free children from behind

 the razor wire, close W oomera, return detention centre

 management to the public sector, and lift the shroud of secrecy

 around detention centres through media access and the

 involvement of independent medical professionals.

 On Thursday, Labor outlined a number of additional ways it will

 ensure mandatory detention treats people in an Australian way:

 â¢ Labor will run a fast, fair and transparent processing

 regime on Christmas Island and on mainland Australia

 that determines 90% of regime claims in 90 days.

 Genuine refugees will be quickly identified and released

 while failed claimants will be quickly returned.

 â¢ Labor will administer better health and ASIO security

 checks;

 â¢ Those with claims of merit who are ASIO security

 cleared, health cleared and who pose no risks will be

 able to live in hostel style accommodation.  Christmas

 Island will have a supervised hostel.  Any other

 5

 supervised hostels required will only be located in

 regional communities that bid to have one.

 â¢ Labor will create an independent Inspector-General of

 Detention, who will monitor detention conditions and

 resolve complaints.

 â¢ Labor will have an expert committee that will review and

 make recommendations on any case in which a person is

 detained for more than 90 days.

 Labor will treat genuine refugees in an Australian way.

 There are refugees in Australia who, under current laws, may be

 here a lifetime but will never be eligible for family reunion.

 Labor will not maintain such a system.

 Labor will replace this system with a short-term temporary

 protection visa after which a genuine refugee can access a

 permanent protection visa.

 The nature of the global refugee problem is changing.  In the past

 refugee status would last a lifetime.

 Increasingly, the nature of people displacement is that people

 have short-term protection needs.

 We therefore think it’s important to have a first instance

 Temporary Protection Visa.

 At the end of the first TPV we will assess whether anything has

 changed in the in the country of origin.

 6

 If nothing has changed, then their protection needs are ongoing

 and they will get a Permanent Protection Visa.

 Labor will facilitate genuine refugees settling in parts of Australia

 where they will be welcomed and are needed.

 Regional communities that want to increase their population

 through having refugees settle there will be able to do so through

 Labor’s regional settlement plan and will receive targeted

 resources to assist them to do so.

 Labor will give priority to family reunion applications from those

 who have settled in the regions of Australia designated as in

 need of population and with labour shortages.

 Labor recognises that the population distribution in Australia is

 unbalanced.

 Too many people live in Sydney and Melbourne.

 Too few people live in country Australia.

 As a result, there are skills shortages in many parts of Australia.

 Communities are finding it difficult to find labour.

 Businesses are choosing not to invest outside of Sydney and

 Melbourne because they find it difficult to attract labour.

 This is unacceptable.

 It is holding back regional development.

 It means that Australia is not reaching its capacity.

 7

 It means that some inner city regions are expanding rapidly and

 many other regions are being left to whither and die.

 Labor strongly believes that it is not good enough to let some

 regions wither and die.

 We believe strongly in the notion of one nation - in the positive,

 inclusive sense.

 In this regard, I mean a unified and inclusive society.

 One that trusts and supports each other, builds strong and

 effective networks and partnerships and takes the world head on.

 Building our nation, by building our regions both in the city and in

 the country, will provide what our community expects for them

 and their families.

 It will bring about a better quality of life and increased

 opportunity.

 One piece of the regional development puzzle that Labor is

 putting together is changing the settling pattern of refugees and

 new migrants.

 Labor supports the dispersal of these people to our country

 regions.

 They will enrich our regions.

 I also put it too you that the communities themselves must be

 ready to embrace a new culture.

 8

 They must be open to new ideas, new customs, different family

 structures, different foods, different dress and different religions.

 But diversity should not be seen in a negative light.

 Diversity must be seen as having a positive influence on

 community building and a legitimate conduit to regional

 development.

 The capacity to ensure regional sustainability relies on a

 commitment by all tiers of government to regional development.

 It also relies on a concerted, whole of government approach to

 addressing regional needs.

 We must extend our thinking to create new social and economic

 opportunities in regional Australia.

 If our regions are going to be able to support migration, it is vital

 that this agenda is linked with the broader regional development

 agenda.

 Infrastructure development on roads, railways, water provision,

 energy, housing, schools, hospitals, telecommunications and the

 like continue to be desperately needed in regional Australia.

 At the same time it is essential that migrants have access to

 health services, English language lessons, orientation services,

 interpreting and translating services, job network information,

 training assistance social services, referral services and access

 to advice.

 9

 It is essential that we employ flexible support programs that

 ensure such services are available where they are needed,

 whether that’s in the capital cities or the regions.

 We need to encourage local government organisations, non-profit

 organisations, educational institutions or community groups to

 establish formal or informal support networks that work in

 conjunction with government agencies.

 In other words we must recognise that regional migration is a win-win situation so long as it is applied strategically and properly

 supported.

 I am pleased to have had the opportunity to address you today.

 It is a good coincidence that we have announced our asylum

 seeker and refugee policy just days before I address a gathering

 of forward thinking regional Australians.
