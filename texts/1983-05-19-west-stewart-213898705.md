 NEW GRANTS FOR MIGRANT WELFARE

 Intellectually handicapped children, victims of domestic  violence and migrant youth are some of the people who will  benefit from 36 new grants announced today by  Mr Stewart West, Minister for Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs.

 'Î grant of $ 6,200 will enable the Association of Greek  Parents and Guardians of Intellectually Handicapped  Children'in N.S.W. ‘ to undertake a pilot study aimed at  developing a "bridge" between the needs of the migrant 

 handicapped and the mainstream services. The project has  potential for mobilising self help community activities to  supplement the existing resources available to the migrant  handicapped", Mr West said.

 "A grant of $8,000 will enable the Brunswick Domestic  Violence Group in Victoria to develop and implement a  community information program about adult and child  domestic violence; raise community awareness of the issue; 

 and improve .  the facilities available to victims of  domestic violence".

 "Another grant will enable a $10,000 pilot project to  develop models of working with migrant youth, especially  migrant girls, to be carried out by the Youth Affairs  Council of NSW."

 In all 36 community organisations across Australia will  receive grants totalling $126,986 made under the Migrant  Project Subsidy Scheme which provides a once-only subsidy  of up to $10,000 for migrant welfare-related projects.

 "The grants awarded under this Scheme are aimed at  encouraging self-help activities among ethnic communities  and increasing their capacity to respond to changing  welfare needs of their members", said Mr West.

 All ethnic groups and migrant oriented welfare  organisations, are eligible for grants.  The grants are  awarded twice yearly, and applications for the next round  close on 30 September 1983 at Regional Offices of the  Department. .
