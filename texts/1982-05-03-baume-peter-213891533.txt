 Commonwealth Department of 

 EDUCATION news release 20/82

 3 May 1982

 SAS CLOSING DATE NEAR

 Parents who wanted to receive their full entitlement for 

 1982 under the Commonwealth Government's Secondary Allowances 

 Scheme (SAS) should apply immediately, a spokesman for the 

 Commonwealth Department of Education said today.

 Applications must be lodged by the last day of first term 

 for assistance to be paid for the whole year.

 The Scheme is intended to help parents keep their children 

 at school for the final two years (Years 11 and 12) of 

 secondary education.

 SAS benefits may be paid to parents of students who are 

 studying full-time in either Year 11 or Year 12 at,a secondary 

 school, college of technical and further education, college 

 of advanced education or through a State education department 

 correspondence school. Benefits are usually only paid to 

 parents. However, students who are orphans or refugees with 

 no parents in Australia may apply for SAS benefits on their 

 own behalf.

 The Scheme provides a maximum allowance of $726 this year 

 compared with $660 in 1981.

 Benefits are means-tested on the adjusted family income (combined 

 income of parents minus certain deductions). The maximum 

 allowance is payable if the adjusted family income is $8,482 or 

 less ($7,440 in 1981).

 No benefits are payable if the adjusted family income is 

 $11,332 or more, but the level is higher where there is more 

 than one eligible student in the family.

 For students eligible to apply on their own behalf a separate 

 means test on their income is used instead.
