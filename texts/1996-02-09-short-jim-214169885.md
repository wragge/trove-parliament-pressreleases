 COALITION REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO  MULTICULTURAL AUSTRALIA

 In launching the Coalition’s Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Policy today, the Leader of the  Opposition, Mr John Howard, strongly reaffirmed the Coalition’s continuing commitment to a  multicultural Australia in which all Australians are able to participate fully in our inclusive society, to  realise their aspirations, and to achieve their full potential.

 The Coalition will pursue policies which will farther enhance Australia’s unique, culturally diverse,  liberal democratic society based on freedom, equality of opportunity, tolerance, cohesion and peace  within the framework of national unity.

 The Coalition will have as a major priority the establishment of consultative arrangements that will  ensure real and meaningful community input into a Coalition Government’s decision making processes.

 The Coalition is committed to the provision of a full range of settlement services to ensure that all  newly arrived migrants are able to participate fully in an inclusive Australia.

 We will address the special needs o f refugees and humanitarian entrants, with particular attention to  torture and trauma counselling.

 Community organisations will be encouraged to play a larger role in the provision of settlement services  in addition to the services now provided both by them and governments. We will provide an additional  $20 million over the next four years to enable them better to assist their clients.

 A common language is the glue of a cohesive nation. It is important that all Australians, wherever  possible, can speak English so that they can participate fully in the life of our nation. The Coalition will  give greater emphasis to English language training. We will increase the flexibility of the Adult Migrant 

 English Program to improve its effectiveness. Funding for English language training and education will  be increased by $17 million over the next four years.

 The Coalition abhors all forms of racism. All Australians have a responsibility to stamp out racism  wherever it occurs. The basic cause of racism is ignorance. Education is the only viable long term  approach which will eradicate racism. To this end the Coalition will commit $10 million to a two year  extensive multi-pronged education campaign directed towards schools and other educational  institutions, as well as the wider community.

 The Coalition’s support of multicultural broadcasting is unequalled by any other political party. The  Coalition is strongly committed to maintaining the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) as a separate

 entity. We will maintain the level of Commonwealth funding SBS currently receives. We will continue  to support triennial funding.

 We will maintain the existing level of budget funding for SBS's Independent Production Fund.

 SBS Television's coverage is currently only 75 percent of the population. The Coalition will provide an  additional $10.5 million toward the goal o f extending SBS Television's coverage to 100 percent.

 The Coalition welcomes the expansion of SBS Radio to all capital cities and supports its ongoing roll­ out into regional areas.

 We will fund SBS directly for its transmission costs on condition it continues its national coverage and  existing service commitments to rural and remote areas.

 Recognising the important role played by the multicultural community broadcasting sector in the lives  of many ethnic communities, we will provide an additional $3 million over three years to support the  further expansion o f multicultural community broadcasting.

 Older Australians of overseas origins, particularly those from NESB, can have special needs and  encounter special problems, eg loss o f English language ability. A major priority for these senior citizens  is the provision of aged care accommodation options - including both residential and at home  accommodation, and dementia specific facilities - that best meet their needs. The Coalition will ensure  that they have fair and equitable access to community support services.

 Women from non-English speaking backgrounds frequently have special requirements in the provision  of health services. The Coalition will develop measures to address specific problems. In cooperation  with ethnic communities we will encourage increased awareness of cultural sensitivities in the delivery  o f health services, including the detection o f breast and cervical cancer, pregnancy, child birth, and 

 psychological services.

 The Coalition will encourage all permanent residents to become Australian citizens. This will be  combined with an expanded system o f voluntary citizenship classes to provide potential citizens with  information and knowledge of Australia, its history, heritage, symbols, institutions and laws.

 The Coalition will also establish an Australian Council on Citizenship (ACC), comprising prominent  Australians drawn from a broad cross section of the community, to undertake a comprehensive and  independent review o f all aspects of Australian citizenship.

 Other initiatives of the Coalition's Multicultural A ffairs and Settlement Policy include:

 â¢ an access and equity strategy, to be implemented in cooperation with the states and territories, to  ensure all Australians have access to all publicly funded services, without discrimination. We will  enable Australians from non-English speaking backgrounds who have disabilities to gain greater  access to services through the provision of information, support and encouragement.

 â¦ a commitment to maintain our support for non-govemment (including ethnic and religious) schools.  We will expand the rights o f parents to establish schools which reflect their cultural and/or religious  values and beliefs.

 * a commitment to continuing support for migrant resource centres.

 *· a commitment to establish a Refugee Resettlement Advisory Council to advise on the  appropriateness and adequacy o f Commonwealth refugee services.

 â¢ support for the encouragement o f all Australians having the opportunity to leam a second and third  encourage this with the cooperation of the States and Territories.

 â¢ a guarantee o f continued operation o f the Commonwealth Translation and Interpreter Service (TIS)  on a commercial basis.

 â¢ measures to assist small business, in which NESB Australians play an important role. The Coalition  will simplify fringe benefits tax, provide capital gains tax rollover relief for small business, replace  Labor's unfair dismissal laws, reduce the costs of doing business, and restore incentive.

 The Coalition welcomes and supports cultural diversity in Australia within the framework of a socially  cohesive, tolerant and harmonious nation united by common values, goals and aspirations.

 Australia is one nation built by people from many cultures. Within this policy framework, we are  committed to giving all Australians the greatest freedom of choice in how they live their lives and how  they preserve and share their cultural traditions.
