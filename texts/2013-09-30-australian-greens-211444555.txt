 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Monday, 30 September 2013   

 Labor must back Greens’ move to reveal what  the government is trying to hide   

 The Labor Party must support moves to end the government’s practice of hiding information about  refugee boat arrivals, interceptions and tow-backs from the Australian people, the Australian Greens  have said.   

 “The government’s policy of hiding information has only been in place for one week and already  we’ve seen a tragic sinking followed by confusion and the spread of misinformation,” the Greens’  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The Greens have announced that we will use the Parliament to force the government into being  upfront with the Australian people. Labor now needs to confirm that they’ll be backing that move.   

 “The Greens’ order for production of documents, which will be moved when Parliament resumes,  will hold this Abbott government to account and the Labor Party must support it.   

 “Deterrence measures haven’t stopped the boats, but the arrogance of the Liberal government has  stopped the flow of information about them to the Australian people.   

 “Tony Abbott’s plans are extremely dangerous and expensive. The Australian people deserve to  know about their implementation.”
