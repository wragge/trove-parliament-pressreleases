 MINISTER REASSURES INDO-CHINESE COMMUNITY

 Australia has a continuing commitment to assist·, refugees,

 |  particularly those from Indo China, the Minister for 

 !  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee, said today,

 "Although Australia's policy of assistance to refugees takes 

 full account of situations in all parts of the world, such 

 as that now developing in Poland, the primary continuing 

 focus of concern for Australia will remain the situation 

 in S,E. Asia," he said.

 Speaking- at a meeting in Melbourne with the Vietnamese 

 Association of.Victoria, the Minister said that the 

 Indo-Chinese Community in Australia should.have no cause for 

 concern about their future in Australia or that of relatives 

 and fellow countrymen.who in the future may have legimate 

 claims on resettlement here.

 "The fact that the Government has undertaken a review of our 

 refugee programmes and selection procedures for those 

 programmes, should not be interpreted as any hardening of 

 the Government's approach to refugee resettlement. This 

 review will allow a more flexible response to the changing 

 situation."

 "The prospect of agreement with the Government of Vietnam on 

 an orderly migration arrangement may mean that many people 

 in Vietnam who have legitimate family reunion claims on 

 resettlement here will be encouraged to avoid the risks of 

 illegal departure by boat," he said.

 "The programme for resettlement of Indo-Chinese this year 

 will remain at much the same level as last y e a r , because 

 there are still many thousands of refugees in camps in 

 Malaysia and Thailand." .  .  .  ,

 / . â 

 The GoA'-ernment's review of programme procedures was meant

 to ensure that all people accepted for resettlement in 

 Australia were in fact genuine refugees who have a well 

 founded fear of persecution,, Such persons will continue 

 to be accepted by Australia, but people merely seeking a 

 better life in another country cannot expect to be given 

 preferred resettlement as refugees in Australia.

 "Such persons are no different from the one million persons 

 who apply annually to migrate to Australia."

 Mi’  Macphee said the new arrangements are meant only to exclude 

 such people and to discourage unrealistic expectation that 

 all those who leave their country for whatever reason acquire 

 an automatic right to resettlement.

 "The Vietnamese association of Victoria and its counterparts 

 in other States are performing an invaluable role in 

 assisting their fellow countrymen to adjust to life in 

 their new country."

 These efforts are an invaluable adjunct to the Government's 

 own post arrival assistance programmes and to the splendid 

 work done by Australian individuals and organisations,"

 Mr Macphee said.
