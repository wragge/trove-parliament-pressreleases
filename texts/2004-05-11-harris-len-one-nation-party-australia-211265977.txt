 Senator  LEN HARRIS  Pauline Hanson's One Nation Senator for Queensland 

 

 

  M E D I A   R E L E A S E 

 Immigration Department accused of double standards  10 May 2004  One  Nation  Senator  Len  Harris  has  demanded  an  explanation  and  an  apology  from  the   Immigration  Minister  after  a  day  of  drama  and  the  near  deportation  of  Thai  girl,  Plarm   Pongprom.   

 Plarm, a 12 year old school captain who lives in Mareeba, entered Australia legally on a  visitor's  visa  after  she  was  abandoned  in  Thailand.   She  has  been  living  in  Far  North   Queensland with her grandparents for three years.  

 

 Plarm's visa is normally renewed every 28 days with official notification four days before  expiry.  But  last  Friday,  the  Immigration  Department  contacted  Plarm's  grandparents  at   5.30pm, with the warning that her visa would expire at 5pm today. 

 

 "Family  and  friends  were  put  into  a  spin,  unable  to  contact  legal  representatives  or   Immigration Department officials," Senator Harris said.   

 "Today,  the  Immigration  Department  contacted  Plarm's  grandparents  who  were  invited   for an interview at 4.45 PM, just 15 minutes before the visa was due to run out."    

 "We  did not know what the outcome of this interview would be, it was very uncertain.   Around 1pm, I was tipped off that officials were on their way to detain Plarm."   

 "I  immediately  faxed  appeal  information  to  the  Asylum  Seekers  Resource  Centre  in   Melbourne.  The  appeal  was  based  on  the  fact  that  the  Immigration  Department  gave   insufficient notice that Palm's visa was about to expire."  

 

 "At  2pm,  after  the  appeal  was  lodged,  the  Immigration  department  phoned  Plarm's   grandparents to advise that a 28 day extension on her visa had been granted."    

 Senator Harris said he wanted some answers as to why the Immigration Department had  treated  a  12  year  old  girl  in  such  an  appalling  manner.  "We  are  also  looking  for  an   explanation as to why Plarm's initial application for permanent residency was rejected."  

 

 Senator  Harris  said  he  knew  of  cases  where  the  Immigration  Department  had  granted   three and a half year temporary visas for illegal boat people who paid people smugglers  to bring them to Australia.   

 "And yet here we have a 12 year old girl who is refused permanent residency. Every 28  days,  she  and  her  family  and  friends  have  to  go  through  this  harrowing,  touch  and  go   experience.    

 "Plarm  entered  Australia  legally  on  a  visitor's  visa,  and  is  forced  to  live  like  this  on  a   knife edge."   

 Senator Harris said it was out of the question that Plarm should be returned to Thailand  where  she  had  no  parents  or  guardians.   Plarm  came  here  legally  and  has  lived  in   Australia  and  has  been  welcomed  by  our  community  here  in  Mareeba.   She  has  done   nothing wrong, nothing illegal, and is treated like a criminal.   

 Senator Harris said Plarm and her grandparents deserved an apology and an explanation  from the Immigration Department.
