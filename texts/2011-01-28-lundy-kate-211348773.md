 AUSTRALIA’S FIRST UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW AT THE UNITED NATIONS   

 Attorney-General Robert McClelland said Australia’s appearance at the United Nations Human  Rights Council in Geneva overnight for its first Universal Periodic Review was an excellent  opportunity to highlight our human rights achievements.   

 The Universal Periodic Review was set up by United Nations in 2006 to create a regular process of  review for all countries to ensure they comply with their international human rights obligations.   

 The Australian delegation was led by Senator Kate Lundy, Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime  Minister and included Australia’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Mr Peter  Woolcott, as well as senior Australian Government officials.   

 The Attorney-General had hoped to lead the Australian delegation, but was unable to do so due to  his responsibilities for emergency management and the unprecedented flood crisis across Australia  at present.     

 “As Senator Lundy noted in Geneva, the Universal Periodic Review is an important opportunity to  reflect on progress we have made and to renew our determination that in the fields of human rights,  equality and opportunity, we can always achieve more,” said Attorney-General Robert McClelland.   

 “The Australian Government will continue to work with the international community and the  Australian Human Rights Commission and non-government organisations domestically to promote  and protect fundamental human rights at home and the rest of the world.”   

 “Australia’s appearance at the United Nations Human Rights Council was a good opportunity to  discuss our strong human rights record,” Senator Lundy said.   

 “A large number of countries acknowledged the significant amount of work the Australian  delegation had undertaken in preparing for the review, including working with the Australian Human  Rights Commission and the non-government sector.”   

 During the three hour dialogue before the Human Rights Council, the delegation received questions  from a range of other countries about Australia’s human rights record.   

 The delegation noted that since the Labor Government was elected in 2007, significant action on  human rights has been taken, including:   

 ï· Becoming a party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the  Optional Protocol to that Convention;   ï· Acceding the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of  Discrimination against Women;

 ï· Signing the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture;   ï· Giving its support to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; and   ï· Issuing a standing invitation to Special Procedures of the United Nations Human Rights  Council to visit Australia.   

 The Australian delegation outlined key elements of Australia’s Human Rights Framework, launched  by the Attorney-General last year.     

 This includes introducing legislation to enhance parliamentary scrutiny of human rights  considerations in new legislation, including a new Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights.     

 The framework also includes the Government’s commitment to consolidate Australia’s anti-discrimination laws and funding for community education and engagement programs, including  grants for NGOs to deliver human rights awareness programs across the community.   

 A number of countries at the United Nations Human Rights Council praised the Human Rights  Framework initiative.   

 The delegation also answered questions across a number of areas including the rights of Indigenous  peoples and Australia’s procedures for processing asylum seeker claims.    

  The delegation responded by outlining the Closing the Gap agenda, emphasising the recent  reinstatement of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 in relation to the Northern Territory Emergency  Response, and the recent establishment of an expert panel to recommend a way forward on  constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians.   

 The delegation also highlighted how Australia has benefited from the 6.9 million migrants from  around the world who have made Australia their home since 1945, including 750,000 refugees or  people in humanitarian need. In relation to immigration detention, it emphasised the Key  Immigration Detention Values, which significantly change the approach taken to immigration  detention in Australia, including a commitment to ensuring that time in immigration detention  centres is only used as a last resort and for the shortest practicable time.   

 During its Universal Periodic Review, the Australian Government also announced a number of new  commitments in the area of human rights. This included:    

 ï· Funding for the Australian Human Rights Commission for stand-alone Race and Disability  Discrimination Commissioners, in addition to funding recently committed for the first-ever  Age Discrimination Commissioner;  

 ï· Contributing $2.35 million to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights  (OHCHR) through AusAID’s Human Rights Fund to help promote human rights, particularly in  the Asia-Pacific region; and providing $650,000 to the Asia Pacific Forum to help establish  and strengthen human rights institutions in the region.   

 

 The Government also committed to increasing Australia’s engagement and consideration of our  international human rights obligations domestically by:

 ï· Tabling in Parliament all concluding observations made by UN treaty bodies to Australia, as  well as recommendations made to Australia in the Universal Periodic Review;  ï· Establishing a systematic process for the regular review of Australia’s reservations to  international human rights treaties;  ï· Establishing a publicly accessible, online database of recommendations from the UN human 

 rights system, including recommendations made by UN human rights treaty bodies to  Australia as well as recommendations made to Australia in the Universal Periodic Review;   ï· Using the recommendations made during the Universal Periodic Review and accepted by  Australia to inform the development of Australia’s new National Human Rights Action Plan; 

 and 

 ï· Ensuring that recommendations are easily accessible to various levels of Government and to  civil society will enhance awareness and understanding of the international human rights  processes in which Australia participates, and will lead to more effective engagement with  international human rights mechanisms.   

 ï· The Government will also provide new funding to the Human Rights Law Resource Centre to  assist to assist it to coordinate NGO sector involvement with the Government's Human  Rights Framework   

 The Australian delegation will attend the UN Human Rights Council on Monday for the adoption of  the outcomes report from the review.     

 Australia will give consideration to the range of recommendations made and respond to the Council  in due course.
