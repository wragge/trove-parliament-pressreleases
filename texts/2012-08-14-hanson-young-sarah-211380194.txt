 Prime Minister’s appearance at anti-gay marriage conference will disappoint many Australians:  Greens 

 The Greens today said it is disappointing to see the Prime Minister Julia Gillard lining up with  Australia Christian Lobby and agreeing to be the key-note speaker at their National Conference in  October.   

 “It is one thing for the Prime Minister to be opposed to Marriage Equality, quite another for her to  line up with those anti-gay crusaders of the Australian Christian Lobby”, said Greens Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young said today.   

 “Thankfully the Australian Christian Lobby does not speak for the many Australian Christians who are  leading the charge for marriage equality, but instead pursues an extremely anti-gay agenda that  doesn’t reflect equality or modern values. 

 “The Prime Minister seems to be morphing into John Howard, not just sending refugees to Nauru  but now cosying up with the Australian Christian Lobby.  

 “We have a Prime Minister who is refusing to stand by her own party policy, and rather than  showing leadership on the issue is standing at the wrong side of history. 

 “We want to see the Prime Minister embrace marriage equality like her ALP states Premiers, move  forward and back her federal members to deliver these inevitable marriage reforms that are  supported by 62% of Australians regardless of their faith.
