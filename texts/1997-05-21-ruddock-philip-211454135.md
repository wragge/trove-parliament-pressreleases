  1997-98 HUMANITARIAN PROGRAM  J 

  Australia's 1997-98 Humanitarian Program will be maintained at a total of 12,000 places  including up to 10,000 offshore places and 2,000 onshore places, the Minister for  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, announced today. 

  "This continues the Government's commitment to deliver a separate, effective and well  targeted Humanitarian Program, which puts the resettlement needs of bona fide  refugees first," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "Australia is a leading humanitarian resettlement country. Our commitment in this area  was commended by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs Ogata,  on her visit to Australia in July 1996." 

  "The UNHCR has estimated that tens of thousand of refugees around the world are in  urgent need of resettlement. On a per capita basis, Australia has a world-leading record  for humanitarian resettlement." 

  "These are people in desperate straits, living in r.efugee camps or other precarious  situations, in fear of repatriation to the country that persecutes them and unable to stay  where they have temporary refuge. Resettlement is their only option. They are the  prime target of Australia's resettlement program." 

  The Humanitarian Program will have four components:

   " 

  Refugee: 4,000 places have been allocated for people who meet the United  Nations Convention definition of a refugee and have been identified in  conjunction with UNHCR as in need of resettlement; 

  Special Humanitarian Program (SHP): 2,800 places have been allocated for  those who have suffered discrimination amounting to gross violation of human  rights and who have strong support from an Australian citizen or resident or a  community group in Australia; and 

  Special Assistance Category (SAC): 3,200 places have been allocated for  those who, while not meeting the refugee or Special Humanitarian criteria, are  nonetheless in situations of discrimination, displacement or hardship. Most SACs  require proposers of applicants to be close family members resident in Australia. 

  Onshore Protection Visa Grants: 2,000 places have been allocated within the  Humanitarian Program for refugees granted Protection Visas in Australia. If the  number granted rises above 2,000 the excess will be drawn from the offshore  element of the Program . 

  "Priority in the Humanitarian Program will continue to be given to the regions of the  former Yugoslavia, the Middle East and Africa," Mr Ruddock said .. 

  "I will be announcing further details of the allocation of Humanitarian Program places to  particular regions and SACs in the near future. These allocations will reflect the refugee  resettlement priorities of UNHCR and the views of interested groups within the  Australian community."
