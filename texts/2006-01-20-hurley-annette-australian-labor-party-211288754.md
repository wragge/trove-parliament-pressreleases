 Senator Annette Hurley  LABOR SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA  SHADOW MINISTER FOR CITIZENSHIP AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS

 Will DIMIA dodge yet another enquiry?   

 

 Shadow Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Citizenship, Senator  Annette Hurley is disappointed that there will be no coronial enquiry  into the death of newly arrived Burundian refugee, two year old  Richard Niyonsaba.   

 “We are saddened that young Richard Niyonsaba’s death won’t be  investigated further by the NSW Coroner”, Senator Hurley said.   

 Senator Hurley called on DIMIA and the Howard Government to  authorise an independent and public enquiry into the events which  lead to this tragedy. This inquiry also needs to have the power to call  any witnesses, including Government officials.   

 “The simple fact is that a young child has tragically died whilst being  under the care of a Government funded organisation. Australians are  entitled to know whether this tragic death could have been avoided 

 and whether there is any risk of this happening again.”   

 “The Howard Government has a pretty good track record of dodging  enquiries. Is the Government so insensitive that it won’t investigate  the death of a young boy who died whilst under the supervision of a  Government funded association?”    

 “Only through an independent and public enquiry will we know if there  is a duty of care issue here”   

 Shadow Minister Hurley has also challenged her counterpart, Minister  John Cobb, to support an inquiry.  “In his press release (December 30, 2005) Mr Cobb stated that  services provided to refugees were ‘world-class’. If he truly believes  this then he shouldn’t have any opposition to a full enquiry”
