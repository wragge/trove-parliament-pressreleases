 GREENS LAUNCH FIRST TV AD & VICTORIAN CAMPAIGN                              

 Supporters joined Greens Leader Senator Christine Milne, Deputy Leader Adam Bandt, Lead Senate  Candidate Janet Rice and other candidates at Melbourne’s Victorian Arts Centre to launch the  Victorian Greens election campaign today.   

 Senator Milne outlined how the Greens were on track to secure a second Victorian Senate spot and  retain Adam Bandt’s seat of Melbourne.   

 The Greens also unveiled their first TV election advertisement ‘Standing up for What Matters’. It can  be viewed here.   

 The advertisement outlines the Greens’ vision for a more caring Australia and highlights key areas  where the Labor and Liberal parties are out of step with the Australian community, including  refugees, global warming, higher education and marriage equality.   

 Australian Greens Leader Christine Milne said the advertisement would stand in marked contrast to  the negative campaigning by the old parties.   

 “Australians are desperate for political leadership on the issues that matter.   

 “But instead they are getting a competition on who can be cruellest to refugees, who can take us  backwards fastest on global warming, and cuts to university education.   

 “The Australian Greens new election advertisement tells a story that voters want to hear for our  nation. 

 “In 2010 we made history with Adam Bandt being elected in the seat of Melbourne. This year we can  do it again with Adam Bandt being re-elected and Janet Rice joining our team in the Senate,” said  Senator Milne. 

 The advertisement will go to air nationally from Monday.    

 The campaign launch was also addressed by the New Zealand Greens Leader Metiria Turei who  highlighted the lessons of the recent election campaign in New Zealand where the Greens secured  an additional five seats.   

 Speaking about his campaign to retain the seat of Melbourne, Deputy Leader Adam Bandt said: “Our  campaign has been built on the assumption Labor and Tony Abbott would collaborate on  preferences. If we continue our strong campaign focused on standing up for refugees and against  Labor’s cuts to clean energy and universities, we will hold this seat regardless of any deal between  Labor and Tony Abbott.   

 Janet Rice said: “I've been inspired by the people I've met while campaigning. They are supporting  the Greens because we are standing up for them in calling for an increase to Newstart, restoring  single parents benefits and investing in public transport. It will be a privilege to represent them in  the Senate if I am elected.”
