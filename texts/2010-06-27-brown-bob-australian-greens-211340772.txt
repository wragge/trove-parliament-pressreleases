 A humane approach to asylum seekers is crucial to any sustainable population policy said Australian 

 Greens leader Bob Brown today. 

 

 Senator Brown welcomed Prime Minister Julia Gillard's re-badging of the Minister for Population as the 

 Minister for Sustainable Population.  

 

 "Australia needs a sustainable population determined by our infrastructure and environmental capacity," 

 said Senator Brown. 

 

 "Asylum seekers make up a tiny fraction of overall immigration levels, and it is the other 90% plus of 

 immigration that debate should focus on. 

 

 "The focus of debate should be on re-evaluating skilled migration levels in favour of training Australians 

 while meeting our international obligations to protect genuine refugees. 

 

 Senator Brown called on the Prime Minister to outline her timeline for action on climate change. 

 

 "The need for action on climate change is urgent.  Prime Minister Gillard ought not delay until after an 

 election, or until 2013 as her predecessor had planned, before giving Australians a real action plan on 

 climate change.  We Greens will get the ball rolling in the future by giving the new Prime Minister a 

 proposal on climate change."
