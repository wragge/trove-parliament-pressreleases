 Greens repeat opposition to Malaysian people swap 

 The Australian Greens have repeated their condemnation of the proposed Malaysian  Solution, pointing out it has not been signed by the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees. 

 “Australians should not be fooled by the government’s insistence that this impending  arrangement will protect the rights of 800 vulnerable people,” Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, said today. 

 “There’s no way the 800 people Australia expels will be treated any better than the 94,000  other asylum seekers in Malaysia. 

 “Is Malaysia going to be giving the basic bottom line guarantees of protection -- such as non-refoulement, freedom from arbitrary detention, physical punishment, the right to work and  access to health and education -- to everyone when there have been no changes in its  domestic laws? 

 “It seems unlikely these bottom line guarantees will be met if the UNHCR has not signed the  deal. 

  “The Greens think the Malaysia deal, along with one the government still intends to sign  with Papua New Guinea, are inhumane and will cost Australians at least $292m to export  our humanity and international obligations onto other countries. 

 “Eight hundred people should not have to be sacrificed by taking a treacherous voyage to  Australia before the government helps 4,000 assessed refugees. 

 “We also again call on the government to immediately begin assessing the claims of every  asylum seeker who has arrived in Australia since May 7, with a view to resettling those in  genuine need of protection. 

 “The Greens are also extremely concerned about another night of violence on Christmas  Island and a hunger strike at the Scherger detention centre.”
