 GP Super Clinic on the way for City of Hume  Residents of the City of Hume are the winners today following the signing of a $7 million agreement between the Gillard Government and Dianella Community  Health for a GP Super Clinic in Broadmeadows. 

 Minister for Health and Ageing Nicola Roxon and local Federal Member for  Calwell Maria Vamvakinou welcomed the news as a win for Broadmeadows and  the local area. 

 “This GP Super Clinic will deliver more doctors, more nurses, more allied health  professionals and better access to health services for locals,” Minister Roxon  said.

 “The Gillard Government wants to make it easier for all Australians to see and  contact a doctor, closer to home. 

 “National health reform will continue to deliver for Broadmeadows when this  Clinic opens and starts to provide a new level of integrated, multidisciplinary, team-based, patient-centred healthcare all under one roof.” 

 Member for Calwell Maria Vamvakinou said that Dianella Community Health will  establish the new GP Super Clinic, building on its record of working with local  hospitals, local GPs and community organisations. 

 “This GP Super Clinic will bring together GPs, nurses, visiting medical  specialists, allied health professionals and other health care providers and  services.”

 The Broadmeadows clinic is expected to include general practice, physiotherapy,  dietetics, occupational therapy, podiatry, psychology, adult speech pathology and  exercise physiology, with a strong emphasis on chronic disease care. 

 The clinic will have a role in training and educating the future health workforce as  it will focus on training and education for medical and nursing students and  support training in medical-related disciplines for people from disadvantaged  groups, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and refugees.   

 “The Gillard Government is making a significant investment in the GP Super  Clinics program and has committed $528 million to build 64 GP Super Clinics  around Australia,” Minister Roxon said. 

 “We have also funded around 425 Primary Care Infrastructure Grants to upgrade  and extend existing general practices, primary care and community health  services, and Aboriginal Medical Services." 

 31 GP Super Clinics are either operational, providing early services or under  construction.
