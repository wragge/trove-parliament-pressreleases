 Chen letter to Government 

 9th Jun 2005 

 Greens Senator Bob Brown has released the full text of the letter  handed to the Howard Government two weeks ago by Chinese  diplomat and defector Chen Yonglin. Mr Chen has agreed to the  release. Senator Bob Brown says the letter reveals a man tormented  and having nightmares about his spying on religious and political  groups including people he refers to as ‘vulnerable’ and ‘innocent’.

 He says he would rather die than return to a job in China which would  involve repressing Falun Gong religious adherents. He describes  Australia as a ‘second home’ and seeks asylum for himself, his wife  and 6 year old daughter.    

 “Here is a story of unfolding awareness of his Beijing bosses’ ruthless  and unforgivable repression of Chinese dissenters. It is a remarkable  document of human decency transcending political evil,” Senator  Brown said.    

 “Mr Chen has made it clear to me that he loves China, his homeland,  but deplores the Beijing authorities.     

 “He deserves a much better hearing in Australia from our own  government, which, so far, has given him nothing at all. Mr Downer’s  criticism that Mr Chen’s letter seeking asylum was not addressed to  him is specious.    

 “It was an appeal to the Australian Government and Mr Downer is the  responsible minister. One gets the feeling that had the letter begun  ‘oh, great and honourable minister Downer’ it would have been  rejected because it was not in capitals.    

 “The Government’s own guidelines require the Department of 

 Immigration to direct approaches for political asylum to Foreign  Affairs,” Senator Brown said.
