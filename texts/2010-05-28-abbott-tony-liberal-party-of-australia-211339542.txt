 Tony Abbott Doorstop - Australia’s  borders; Kevin Rudd’s hypocrisy on  government advertising   28/05/10  

 Subjects: The Coalition’s policy for restoring sovereignty and control to Australia’s  borders; Kevin Rudd’s hypocrisy on government advertising; whaling; Labor  leadership.  

 E&OE 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Mr Rudd has plainly given up on any serious attempt to protect Australia’s borders.  As we know, under the former government there were three boats a year, under the  Rudd Government there are now three boats a week. The former government found a  problem, created a solution. The current government found a solution and created a  problem because the Prime Minister wasn’t man enough to leave well enough alone.  He’s saying that the proposals that the Coalition put forward yesterday can’t be done  because they’re too expensive. Well, I point out to the Prime Minister that his own  policy has caused a blowout of almost $1 billion over the forward estimates periods in  the cost of processing asylum seekers and illegal arrivals. Every illegal arrival costs  something like $82,000 to process. The only way to get costs down is to stop the boats  and the only way to stop the boats is to change the government. 

 On another topic, we have seen an absolutely outrageous example today of a  Government that is completely without any moral compass, without any real ethical  dimension. Before the last election Mr Rudd called government advertising ‘a cancer  on our democracy’. That’s what he said, he said government advertising was a cancer  on our democracy. Now, even given the Prime Minister’s habitual hyperbole, even  given the Prime Minister’s exaggerations, to call something a cancer on our  democracy is pretty serious. 

 Today we find out that the Government has exempted itself even from its own elastic  requirements to run an emergency advertising campaign on the mining tax. Now, the  justification it’s given for this campaign is that misinformation is affecting financial  markets and yet just this morning the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister  have been denying that their great big new tax on mining has had any impact of  financial markets. 

 This is just an outrageous rip off. As I said, it’s a sign of a Government which really is  into ethics evasion, it’s a Government which will say or do anything in its desperation  to hold on to power and it’s a sign of the sorry pass that public administration has  come to in this country. 

 Let me just say of this government that it’s broken promises, that’s bad. It’s wasted  money, that’s worse. It’s now aiming a dagger at the heart of our prosperity, that’s  almost criminal. Today’s action shows just how desperate this government is. I think 

 the Australian public are coming to the conclusion that they are not fit to govern. 

 QUESTION: 

 So you dispute the reasons that have been given to change these guidelines, the  misinformation, market volatility not sound reasons to change the guidelines? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Well, the government can’t have it both ways. They can’t say that their great big new  tax on mining is having no effect on financial markets and then claim that the effect  on financial markets justifies suspending even the existing elastic requirements to  have an emergency advertising campaign. I mean, this is a desperate act from an  ethically-challenged and completely panicked government. 

 QUESTION: 

 Whaling, the International Court against Japan. Do you welcome that? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 The Coalition strongly opposes so-called scientific whaling. We support appropriate  and effective action in international tribunals but I think this is clearly just an effort by  the government to distract attention from the terrible trouble it finds itself in over its  border protection failures and over the chaos now surrounding its great big new tax on  mining. 

 QUESTION: 

 Sure, but Mr Abbott do you support taking Japan to the International Court or not? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 I support appropriate and effective action in international tribunals. 

 QUESTION: 

 Are you at all curious about the timing of this, the fact that it’s been brought forward  so much? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Plainly, it’s a smokescreen for the government’s failures. Plainly, it’s a smokescreen  against the government’s latest attempt to brainwash the Australian people with a  dishonest advertising campaign. 

 QUESTION: 

 You say you support appropriate action. Do you think that taking this action against  Japan is appropriate? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Well, I haven’t seen the legal advice. We’ve said in the past that we want the  government to show us their legal advice. They haven’t seen fit to do so. All I can do  is repeat the principle that we support appropriate and effective action in international  tribunals. 

 QUESTION: 

 But that’s a loose term. If you were in government would you take Japan to the  International Court or not? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Well, if we were in government we’d be able to see the legal advice and, as I said, we  support appropriate and effective action in international tribunals. 

 QUESTION: 

 So you’re waiting to see more details before you’ll say whether or not you’ll support  it? Is that the case? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 Well, what I’m saying is that we support appropriate and effective action in  international tribunals. 

 QUESTION: 

 Peter Beattie has given a glowing endorsement of Julia Gillard today. Do you agree  with him that she’ll make a great PM one day? 

 TONY ABBOTT: 

 There seems to be a split in the ranks of Queensland Labor figures. I would’ve  thought that Peter Beattie would’ve supported his fellow Queenslander against Julia  Gillard’s coming challenge but he probably doesn’t think that Kevin’s a fair dinkum  Queenslander either.
