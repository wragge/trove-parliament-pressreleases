 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Tuesday, 25 February 2014    

 Manus staff must be stood down until  investigation complete    

 Any staff suspected of carrying out the attacks against refugees at the Manus  Island detention camp should be stood down until the investigation into their  behaviour is complete, the Australian Greens have said.    

 “Every employee suspected of taking part in the barbaric attack on the camp  must be immediately stood down until the incident has been adequately  investigated,” The Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “G4S staff have blown the whistle and explained how they saw other G4S  employees beating refugees.     

 “The Manus Island camp is Australia’s own gulag in the Pacific. Eventually this  dangerous centre will be closed down but for now, at the very least, the people  suspected of these attacks must be removed from the camp.    

 “As the new security provider, Transfield Services should take this decisive  action as their first move after assuming control of the centre. Leaving refugees  in the care of their brutal attackers is unconscionable.    

 “Despite the Minister’s best efforts, the truth about what took place on Manus  Island will come out. Keeping refugees in danger until the truth is revealed is  unnecessary and unacceptable.”
