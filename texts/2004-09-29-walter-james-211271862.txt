 Radio Host: Do you have a question for the prime minister? 

 Caller: Yes, when is he going to stop lying to us? 

 Radio Host: What do you mean? Do you have anything specific in mind? 

 Caller: Well he lied to us over the ‘children overboard’ affair. He lied to us about 

 why we went to war in Iraq. He lied about… 

 Radio Host: OK, OK…well, prime minister? (Jon Faine morning show, ABC 

 Radio 774 Melbourne, May 19, 2004) 

 

 It’s children overboard all over again. John Howard has put on the white gloves 

 of ignorance and blamed everyone else for not telling him about what he 

 should have known of the Iraq prisoner abuse. (Michelle Grattan, The Age, June 

 2, 2004). 

 

 An outline of this paper was drafted in January 2004. In May-June, as I started writing, 

 two events brought issues into sharp focus. A caller to a morning talkback program 

 accused the prime minister of lying and when pressed cited a string of instances, 

 starting with the ‘children overboard’ affair. And a new imbroglio on June 1, 2004, 

 over misinformation relating to Australian knowledge of Iraqi prisoner abuse, 

 immediately elicited the comment, not only from the opposition but also from a range 

 of media commentators, that this was ‘children overboard’ all over again. How is such 

 short-hand understood in the Australian context? What does it tell us about the way 

 the Australian government operates? In addressing these questions, I relate emerging 

 patterns to institutional transitions that have licensed particular forms of leadership 

 behaviour—forms that suggest the characteristic dysfunctions of groupthink. 

 

 ‘Children Overboard!’ The template 

 In October 2001, as a federal election campaign was about to commence, the 

 Australian prime minister, John Howard, his minister for defence, Peter Reith, and 

 subsequently other senior ministers gave out a disturbing story. Refugees, 

 apprehended at sea in a leaky fishing boat by the Australian navy, had thrown their 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  3   

 children into the sea to force sailors to rescue them and to land them in Australia. 

 Howard used the story to reveal the dubious character of those illegally trying to enter 

 Australia, and to reassert the principle that his government, and his government alone, 

 would determine who entered Australia, how, and who would be allowed to stay. 

 This was presented as part of a broader security agenda—an agenda that played well, 

 and is credited with swinging the election in Howard’s favour (McAllister, 2003). 

 

 The children overboard story was not true. 

 No children were thrown overboard. The photographs published to verify the 

 incident were taken later, when the ship was sinking…Some of the figures in 

 the water were Australian sailors who had dived in to assist the refugees. 

 Within three days … the story was known to be untrue … by all but the very 

 top level of the defence department … There was never any evidence to sustain 

 the story (Weller, 2002: 4). 

 Yet the story was never corrected before the election. It was subsequently to be probed 

 by two Senate committees, and a compelling overview is provided in Pat Weller’s 

 book, Don’t Tell the Prime Minister (2002). We can draw on Weller to isolate the 

 elements of what might be called an operating template. His deconstruction of events 

 directs us to the mindset of the public service, the habits of ministerial staff, the modes 

 of communication between top-level decision-makers, and the culture of Howard’s 

 ministers. 

 

 Within the public service, those officers close to events, who knew what had 

 happened, put their faith in the chain of command correctly to advise the government. 

 Surely the tradition of ‘frank and fearless’ advice would see things right? Yet 

 substantial change in dealings with and terms of appointment of senior public 

 servants by the Howard government have encouraged changes in traditional practice 

 The top mandarins are kept in uncertainty, encouraged to be ‘too responsive, too 

 concerned to show they are on board, too concerned with political protection’ (Weller, 

 2002: 68). In the end: 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  4   

 The question is whether they were so concerned to serve the government of the 

 day…that the urge to serve overpowered the need to be 

 critical…[Some}…reveal a mindset so determined to find evidence to 

 corroborate the story that they glossed over the evidence pointing the other 

 way. (Weller, 2002: 69) 

 

 Ministerial staff played a crucial role. They acted in their minister’s name. They were 

 the conduits for all information: informing them was regarded as equivalent to 

 informing their minister. They were protected from parliamentary inquiry. With 

 respect to the prime minister, they are highly protective: ‘there are things, they will 

 believe, that he is better off not knowing—particularly if the new data contradicts a 

 stand already taken in public’ (Weller, 2002: 71). They have become  

 the “junk-yard attack dogs” of the political system: the hard men and the hit 

 men. They are politically dispensable, convenient scapegoats who will take the 

 bullet for their ministers and protect them from political fallout. (Weller 2002: 

 72) 

 It is here that the issue of who told what to whom becomes impossible to detect: ‘if 

 they were told, did they pass it on or did they decide it was preferable that the 

 minister should not know so that it could be plausibly denied?’ (Weller, 2002: 73). 

 

 Ministerial staff were the key to communications. They attempted to limit all 

 information ‘to that which had the prescribed political spin’ (Weller, 2002: 84). There 

 were (and probably were intended to be) no paper trails. Phone calls, emails, voicemail 

 messages were integral to the unfolding story: most were lost. 

 

 As for the ministers and the prime minister, they simply reiterated ‘we acted on 

 advice’. ‘But it was convenient not to press too hard, not to raise the issue again, and 

 not to ask the hard questions: the convenience of deniability’ (Weller, 2002: 95).  

 The prime minister tells us that he did not know that the story was untrue. But 

 he was surrounded by those who knew, or should have known, that there were 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  5   

 doubts … He later said he would ask for checks to be made. If they were, he 

 insists he was never told the outcome. The advisers never told him and he 

 never pressed them … How do we read this situation? A canny controlling 

 prime minister not told about a story that covered the front pages? … Or could 

 it be a machine working at its best, a machine designed to protect and promote 

 the government? … No one wants the prime minister to have to correct himself 

 during an election campaign … So the prime minister is protected by his 

 ministers, his office and his department. Pleading a lack of clear advice, 

 emphasising the uncertainty, they pass on nothing. ‘Don’t tell the prime 

 minister’ must be the prevailing rule. (Weller, 2002: 101-2). 

 Forlornly, Weller concludes: 

 … for a month the Australian people were not told they had been misled … 

 There are many excuses but few reasons. We need an acceptance of 

 accountability somewhere in the system … If the system failed, we need 

 someone who takes responsibility. If this is a system that was working as 

 participants believed it should, the rest of us should be worried. (Weller, 2002: 

 101). 

 The emergence , in August 2004, of Mike Scrafton—defence liaison staffer in Reith’s 

 office in late 2001—who asserts that he told the prime minister directly that the 

 children overboard story was untrue prior to the 2001 election, an account Howard 

 contests, underscores the possibility of intentional deceit. 

 

 Can all this be discounted as opportunism gone wrong in the heat of an election 

 campaign? Certainly the Senate Select Committee (2002) saw deeper problems: it drew 

 serious lessons from the incident about the need for control and accountability of 

 ministerial staff. Weller and Michael Keating have gone on to elaborate on what those 

 lessons mean for the public service (Tiernan and Weller, 2003; Keating 2003b). And the 

 instances cited at the outset of this paper, from May and June 2004, suggest that the 

 dynamics of the children overboard affair have become a point of reference for the 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  6   

 public and the media. Indeed, repetition of the operating template described above can 

 be discerned in later events. 

 

 Why we went to war 

 We do not yet know accurately what went on in Howard’s office or within his cabinet 

 concerning the decision to join the American-led war in Iraq. We do have his own 

 speeches on the case for war from early 2003 (cited in Parliamentary Joint Committee 

 on ASIO, ASIS and DSD 2004: 87, note 1)—all at that time predicated on the threat 

 posed by WMD, a number of interesting polemics on why the war was wrong 

 (Broinowski, 2003; Gaita, 2003), and a vigorous debate about the government’s use of 

 intelligence in justifying the Australian participation. It is in this last realm that 

 familiar patterns seem most evident and, again, in the report of a parliamentary 

 committee (Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, 2004) and a 

 government initiated inquiry (Flood, 2004) that the most useful evidence can be found. 

 

 By mid 2003, growing scepticism in the US and the UK about the quality of 

 intelligence reports underlying the Iraq engagement was having ramifications for 

 Howard in Australia. His constant response was that ‘no one in the government was 

 told that evidence was seriously flawed’. Yet there were suggestions—some provoked 

 by the resignation of an intelligence officer, Andrew Wilkie, from ONA who then 

 attacked the government’s decision-making—that Howard’s office had put its own 

 spin on intelligence assessments. The Senate referred the question of the nature and 

 uses of intelligence on Iraq to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and 

 DSD on June 18, 2003: it reported on March 1, 2004. 

 

 Appearing before the committee, Wilkie asserted that the government ‘skewed, 

 misrepresented, used selectively and fabricated’ intelligence, resorted to exaggeration 

 ‘so great it was clear dishonesty’, and suggested that words qualifying and tempering 

 intelligence assessments were frequently dropped. He sheeted the blame for distortion 

 home directly to the prime minister’s office, and alleged prime minister Howard and 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  7   

 his foreign minister, Alexander Downer, were the local ‘cheerleaders’ of the invasion 

 campaign. Howard vigorously denied these claims as ‘slander’, repeating that his 

 government’s arguments were ‘consistent with the intelligence assessments we 

 received’. 

 

 The committee apparently did not accept Wilkie’s claims at face value: indeed, it 

 found that Howard’s articulation of the case for war was ‘more moderate and more 

 measured’ than that advanced by George Bush and Tony Blair. Yet in contrasting 

 Howard’s case with the evidence (Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and 

 DSD 2004, chapter 5), it emerges that: 

 â¢ US and UK intelligence assessments were inaccurate and mostly from untested 

 sources—Australia’s key analytical agencies tended to be more cautious about 

 the evidence. 

 â¢ The case that the government made was that Iraq possessed WMD in large 

 quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat. ‘This is not the picture 

 that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the 

 Committee by Australia’s two analytical agencies’. 

 â¢ Where it suited them, Howard’s ministers drew on evidence that best suited 

 their purposes: they simplified and misquoted reports from UNSCOM, 

 UNMOVIC, IAEA and the IISS (see pp. 96-97), and ‘the statements from the 

 Prime Minister and Ministers are more strongly worded than most of the AIC 

 (Australian intelligence community) judgements. This is … because they quote 

 directly from the findings of the British and American intelligence agencies’ (p. 

 94); 

 â¢ ‘ONA agreed that these judgments … were not necessarily ones that they might 

 have made, but … as they were made on the basis of material ONA had not 

 seen, the quotations in the speeches were not questioned. They were considered 

 accurate quotations, in the sense of transcriptions, from the British and US 

 documents’ (p. 94); 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  8   

 â¢ While ‘it is impossible for the Committee to judge how independent from 

 undue external influence the [Australian intelligence] agencies were in relation 

 to their assessments’, and accepting that there was no evidence of overt 

 pressure from government, the committee noted that until September 13, 2002, 

 when the US made public its expectation that Australia would join a pre-emptive strike, the ONA had shared the DIO’s doubts about Iraq’s WMD 

 capacities. On September 13, however, the ONA adopted a much more robust 

 stance: ‘It … was more ready to extrapolate a threatening scenario from 

 historical experience, more ready to accept the new and mostly untested 

 intelligence … It is so sudden a change in judgment that it appears ONA, at 

 least subconsciously, might have been responding to “policy running strong”’.  

 With respect to ONA’s capitulation, one is reminded again of Weller’s comment: ‘the 

 urge to serve overpowered the need to be critical … [resulting in] a mindset so 

 determined to find evidence to corroborate the story that they glossed over evidence 

 pointing the other way’. 

 

 The subsequent report of Phillip Flood’s inquiry into Australian intelligence (Flood, 

 2004) has been read as tempering the Joint Committee report—indeed the government 

 insisted that Flood cleared it of the accusations implied in such points as those above. 

 While Flood explicitly denied that there was evidence that the government had put 

 political pressure on the intelligence community to produce assessment that suited its 

 agenda, he confirmed the relative caution of Australian assessments, the disparity 

 between the views of the DIO and the ONA and something of the puzzle about why 

 ONA had switched to supporting the evidence for WMD (which he attributed to its 

 being under-resourced and over-reliant on overseas agencies whose assessments had 

 already been shown to be flawed). The ONA, as a result, he said, was more exposed. 

 The Flood report, however, begs the question that Weller identified, of a culture that 

 induces compliance without explicit demands having to be articulated. Indeed, in 

 pointing to the absence a ‘a rigorous culture of challenge’, Flood  points towards one 

 of the indicators of ‘groupthink’ (which was to be explicitly acknowledged in both the 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  9   

 US Senate inquiry into intelligence and the Butler inquiry into British intelligence)—a 

 matter to which I return below. More importantly, in identifying the shortcomings of 

 the evidence (it was ‘thin, ambiguous and incomplete’) and in insisting that 

 intelligence is merely the start of the decision-chain (it leads in turn to policy advice 

 and thence to government decisions), Flood may have cleared the intelligence 

 community of responsibility for the decisions taken, but does nothing to dissuade us 

 that Howard and Downer were intent on cherry-picking those aspects of the reports 

 reaching them that best suited a preordained objective.  

 

 In case public servants, however, were so incautious as to diverge from the official 

 mindset, Howard’s office was not averse to taking direct action, as was evident in its 

 vigorous intervention against the expressed opinion of Australian Federal Police 

 Commissioner, Mick Keelty, in March 2003. Keelty’s sin was to speak of the likely 

 increase in the terrorist threat to Australia as a result of its participation in the Iraq 

 war—a view the government refused to acknowledge. The willingness of Howard and 

 his ministers publicly to rebuke a senior professional officer and to induce the issue of 

 a ‘clarification’ in his name (that had apparently been drafted within PM & C) was 

 remarkable. While it did not match the attempt to shred Mike Scrafton’s credibility 

 once he spoke out on the children overboard affair in August 2004, the lessons for 

 senior public servants could hardly have been more starkly underlined. 

 

 On the defensive—again 

 Another case in which ‘plausible deniability’ was the central component emerged in 

 the furore ignited by the revelations of prisoner abuse by US soldiers at Abu Ghraib 

 prison in Iraq. Until June 1, 2004, there was general denial that Australian authorities 

 had known anything before January, when CNN first reported the matter. As to the 

 seriousness of the offences, the prime minister and the secretary of the defence 

 department said they had been made aware in April. As it became evident that the 

 ICRC, however, had circulated reports on the mistreatment of prisoners in October 

 and November, 2003, and newspapers disclosed that an Australian military officer, 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  10   

 Major George O’Kane, had been working with coalition legal teams in Baghdad on 

 prisoner treatment and was in contact with the ICRC at that time, this position came 

 under scrutiny. In late May it was taken up in the questioning of departmental officials 

 in a Senate Estimates Committee. 

 

 The chief of the defence force, General Peter Cosgrove, and the secretary of the 

 department of defence, Ric Smith, released a statement on Friday, May 28, intended to 

 defuse the issue. O’Kane, they said, ‘heard about the seriousness of the issue about the 

 same time as CNN media reporting in late January (2004)’. They acknowledged that 

 O’Kane had worked on a response to the October 2003 ICRC report, but averred that 

 this report ‘raised general concerns about detainee conditions and treatment, but no 

 abuse’. Subsequently, when pressed on this issue, the prime minister repeated the 

 substance of the defence chiefs’ statement, saying, ‘I’ve got nothing to hide’, but 

 reiterating that he was relying on advice from defence.  

 

 During a further day of questioning by the senate committee, Cosgrove and Smith 

 revealed no change in their position, but the following day, Tuesday, June 1—having 

 been summoned by the prime minister early that morning to explain the increasing 

 contradictions uncovered by opposition senators and the press—the story collapsed. 

 Defence secretary Smith conceded that the statement issued on Friday was wrong: not 

 only had O’Kane brought the ICRC working papers of late 2003 back to the 

 department, but also other Australian defence liaison officers with the coalition had 

 seen these documents. O’Kane had reported on his return to Australia in February. 

 ‘We do acknowledge’, said Smith, ‘that the allegations (in the ICRC reports) … were 

 allegations of mistreatment, serious by any standard’. It appears that this information 

 simply was not passed on to the department’s senior officers. In an apology to the 

 committee, Smith and Cosgrove accepted responsibility for giving senior ministers 

 incorrect information over Australian knowledge of the abuse of prisoners. 

 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  11   

 Within half an hour, Howard appeared at a press conference, where he said that all of 

 his statements had been based on advice from the defence department. He could not 

 be accused of misleading the Australian public:  

 I am very unhappy that I was misinformed by the Defence Department … But 

 bear in mind that the chief of the Defence Force and the secretary of the Defence 

 Department were equally poorly served by the advice they received by (sic) the 

 department … I would have done the right thing … If I’d known about it I 

 would have expressed my concern, of course I would. (ABC News, June 1, 2004) 

 In a cogent immediate response, Michelle Grattan insisted that only disclosures by the 

 press and in the senate committee had brought the truth to light. ‘If it had been left to 

 the PM, we’d never have found out’. 

 If there is one message from what’s happened, it is that when this Government 

 is in a jam, it volunteers little except under duress … Howard says he’s ‘very 

 unhappy’ he was misinformed. But it was absolutely his fault. He made little 

 effort to find out … It is possible the advice system is as bad as the PM suggests. 

 On precedent, it is also possible that it was convenient for him not to probe too 

 much. The issue might have gone away. Once again bureaucrats and the 

 military have taken the rap for the politicians … It was clear [from his 

 statement] at the weekend that Howard was making sure he had ‘deniability’ if 

 he needed it. (Michelle Grattan, The Age, June 2, 2004). 

 Not surprisingly, Labor parliamentarians were more direct. Howard’s alleged litany of 

 lies was to become a feature of ALP campaigning up until the 2004 election. 

 

 The sequence of events described here led to the unprecedented issue of a public call 

 for truth in government from 43 former senior military officers and diplomats (July 22, 

 2004). The government vigorously denounced them as yesterday’s men, ‘doddering 

 daiquiri diplomats’ in the words of one minister. It is testimony to the power of the 

 orthodoxies Howard has established, and the complicity of much of the media in 

 them, that this historically unparalleled outburst gained relatively little traction. Yet 

 the important point being made was that precisely in ignoring long-established 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  12   

 conventions and obscuring the probity of government, Howard was destroying trust 

 and ‘Without that trust, the democratic structure of our society will be undermined 

 and with it our standing and influence in the world’. 

 

 So we come full circle. Is it a mistake to see equivalences in a hasty decision made at 

 the inception of a campaign (the ‘children overboard’ story), a major policy process 

 (the building of the case for war in Iraq), and departmental dysfunction leading to 

 incorrect advice (and hence Howard’s ‘inadvertent’ deception of the public over 

 Australian knowledge of prisoner mistreatment)? I argue that, despite their differences 

 in scale and importance, these events manifested significant continuities and 

 repetitions. And, as Oscar Wilde might have said, the resort to ‘I did not know’, ‘I was 

 not told’, and ‘I am not responsible’ once might be accidental, twice is unfortunate, 

 three times is reprehensible. 

 

 Transitional politics? 

 My purpose here is not to accuse the government of lying, but to identify what it is 

 that explains its characteristic modes of handling information as it reaches decisions 

 and communicates what it is about. What we have seen are the government’s 

 propensities for:  

 â¢ high risk behaviour (in its willingness to act on sketchy knowledge and then 

 to gamble that such inconvenient facts as do arise will remain unknown);  

 â¢ ruthlessly selective utilization of knowledge (not only in relation to what it 

 will ‘hear’ but also in how it communicates);  

 â¢ adopting a tactic of ‘plausible deniability’ as a recurrent defence;  

 â¢ encouraging concurrence seeking (and the suppression of contrary 

 evidence) among senior officials; and  

 â¢ deploying partisan advisers not to maximise and diversify advice but to 

 filter, sieve and ensure that information, both in and out, has the 

 appropriate spin (and, at the extreme, to be the ‘attack dogs’ for the policy 

 preferences of the day). 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  13   

 

 In part, these outcomes are driven by the prime minister’s personality and leadership 

 style—to which I’ll return. But, perhaps more important, such approaches have been 

 impelled by institutional transitions that have undermined the entities and 

 conventions that served to constrain leadership caprice. Thus, prime ministers will go 

 too far, with actions that recklessly engender cynicism (and undermine confidence in 

 democratic institutions); with tactics that create a vacuum where accountability should 

 be; with practices that deny transparency (and impede citizen attempts to evaluate 

 decision processes); and, finally, with a mindset that engenders bad decisions. 

 

 Liberal democracy is characterised by the balancing and sharing of power, designed in 

 theory to prevent the dominance of overweening individuals and collusive groups. 

 Quite apart from well-understood formal institutions (commitment to human rights, 

 constitutional separation of powers, and the like), there is a range of conventions 

 underlying political practice that have similar purposes. The need to win power 

 through parties—entailing negotiation and the acknowledgment of shared beliefs—is 

 part of this. In Westminster systems, the reliance on collective (cabinet) authority 

 rather than prime ministerial power; the distinction between partisan objectives and 

 public service advice; the system of accountability, vested in ministerial responsibility, 

 all contribute to the same end. A polity that does not embody such constraints is liable 

 to be one in which leadership excess can flourish (see Glad, 2002). Neither Australia 

 nor other Westminster polities have yet reached this pass. My argument, however, is 

 that the patterns seen above are indicative of transitional politics in a context of change 

 in party politics, prime ministerial dominance, and public service neutrality. 

 

 Party Politics 

 There is an extensive literature on parties and party change in western democracies. 

 Of interest here are the changes in the post war period, when mass parties (with clear 

 programmatic ideologies and an extensive membership) changed to catch - all parties 

 (attempting to net a broad constituency by matching policy to public mood) and 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  14   

 thence to electoral - professional parties (relying on communications professionals and 

 expert advisers rather than party activists) and perhaps to cartel parties (‘part of the 

 state apparatus itself’). (Jaensch, 1994; Marsh, 1995; Marsh, 2004; Ward, 1991; Katz and 

 Mair, 1995). While there is contest over the extent to which such descriptions apply 

 (see, for instance, Goot, 2003), there is agreement on core elements. 

 â¢ The importance of mass membership, branch mobilization and reliance on 

 party activists has declined. 

 â¢ Party machines have become professional: trained bureaucrats and policy 

 experts have supplanted former party interactions. 

 â¢ The need to reach a broad audience directly through new media (rather than 

 through party branches) has drawn communications professionals and ‘spin 

 doctors’ to the centre. 

 â¢ The appeal to a diverse, heterogeneous audience (rather than to shared 

 beliefs) has encouraged issue-oriented and personality-driven campaigns, 

 accentuating ‘the leader’. 

 â¢ High-cost mass media techniques and extensive party bureaucracies cannot 

 be sustained by donations and member-fees: mainstream corporate and 

 organizational support has to be solicited, and messages thus have to be 

 tailored to win and to maintain that support. 

 â¢ Arguably, the major parties become ‘cartel parties’, agents of the state 

 limiting their objectives to arguments over ‘efficient and effective 

 management’, and reliant on ‘subventions and other benefits from the state’, 

 while organizing the system to deny those benefits to challengers (Katz and 

 Mair, 1995; and see Goot, 2003).  

 What is undeniable is that the dominant parties are capital intensive, professional, 

 centralized and dependent on the projection of leader effectiveness. The networks of 

 advice and support, capital generation and communication centre on the leader rather 

 than the party at large: this gives the leader a licence and impact unmatched in former 

 party structures. Indeed, the leader can transform party philosophy and approach, 

 as—in Australia—Bob Hawke and Paul Keating did with the ALP (see, for instance, 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  15   

 Kelly, 1992; Battin, 2004; Day, 2003; Scott, 2000), and as Howard has done with the 

 Liberal Party (Brett, 2003; Curran, 2004; Rundle, 2001; Walter, 2004). 

 

 Prime ministerial dominance 

 Party transitions have been complemented by changes in the role of the prime 

 minister. Ian McAllister, reviewing the state of play, remarks that ‘prime ministers and 

 opposition leaders have replaced many of the roles historically played by political 

 parties in ensuring the efficient operation of the parliamentary system’ (McAllister, 

 2004: 2). Weaker voter attachments enhance the role of the leader. With partisan de-alignment, party leaders ‘stand in’ for parties in representing issues, integrating 

 interests and mobilizing opinion. As parties of mass organization with local branches 

 have declined, voter attention has shifted from the local to the national stage, with 

 parties shifting their emphasis from local to national leaders in parallel. There is less 

 focus on policy, and more on the personality of the leader. Leadership effects on 

 voting outcomes are now widely recognized.  

 

 In government, the complexity of modern decision-making has shifted the emphasis 

 towards charisma, authority and decision and away from collegial consensus: the 

 prime minister has thus become far more than the ‘first among equals’. With the 

 declining influence of party structures, the prime minister’s power over political 

 careers (and hence as the driver of party discipline and object of loyalty) has been 

 much enhanced. The prime minister has become ‘central in how responsible 

 government operates; he or she may choose to include or exclude particular actions 

 under the doctrine, thereby determining [a] minister’s fate … [T]he prime minister, 

 rather than the parliament … determines how the doctrine is implemented’ 

 (McAllister, 2004: 5). Arguably, globalisation plays a part: ‘parliamentary systems are 

 becoming more presidential in character, style and operation, as the environments in 

 which they operate become more uniform’ (McAllister, 2004: 8; and see Marsh, 2003). 

 The trends traced by McAllister all point towards a centralization of power in the 

 prime minister, ‘but the change is gradual and in some cases outweighed by the 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  16   

 personalities involved … In short, the personality of the leader is greater than the 

 strength of the trend’ (McAllister, 2004: 26). This, again, is a point to which I will 

 return. 

 

 Public service neutrality 

 There has always been argument within Westminster democracies over the supposed 

 separation of politics from administration and the capacity for ‘frank and fearless’ 

 advice from a reasonably impartial public service. In Australia, a reasonable case can 

 be made that the federal bureaucracy complemented the parties in a post-war policy 

 project that responded to what the electorate demanded: relatively equal life chances 

 (Brown, 1995; Encel, 1970; Walter, 1999). Ministers were told not only what they 

 wanted to know but also what they needed to know. There is little doubt that the 

 public service within Westminster polities has become more compliant of late, and in 

 the Australian case, more politicised. Weller (2002), as we have seen, bases a great deal 

 of his argument concerning dysfunction in the ‘children overboard’ affair on the 

 complicity of senior public servants—a pattern repeated in the other incidents 

 reviewed above.  

 

 Reforms to the Australian public service, intended to make its leadership more 

 responsive to the government of the day, began under Labor governments in the 1970s 

 and 1980s. Whitlam (ALP, 1972-1975) introduced expanded ministerial staff (Walter, 

 1986). Under Hawke (ALP, 1983-1991), a key measure was the shift of career public 

 servants at the top levels to contract appointments (Keating, 2003a). Howard, since 

 1996, has simply continued where Labor governments began. But that departmental 

 secretaries now serve at their minister’s pleasure was signalled by the sacking of a 

 number immediately upon Howard’s assumption of office, and a later controversial 

 dismissal of (and unsuccessful legal appeal by) a well-regarded career officer who was 

 effective, but not to his minister’s liking. The perception that public - spirited career 

 civil servants have been replaced by political appointees is inevitable. That such quasi-autonomous figures as AFP Commissioner Keelty can be subject to overt pressure to 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  17   

 comply simply accentuates such perceptions. And while it would be naive to expect 

 the government to accept without challenge the attempt of a former public servant, 

 Mike Scrafton, to ‘set the record straight’, the nature of its response underlined the 

 very bullying and intimidation to which Scrafton attested. 

 

 When the authors of public sector reform themselves begin to express concerns, as 

 does a former secretary of PM & C and advocate of reform, Michael Keating (2003a; 

 2003b: 94), it is time to wonder whether ‘responsiveness’ has mutated into the sort of 

 ‘politicisation’ that impedes both the transmission of unwelcome advice and the ability 

 of public servants to ensure due process—and the integrity of the system. 

 

 The picture is further clouded by the increasing augmentation of partisan ministerial 

 staff. Originally introduced to maximise sources of advice, to provide alternative 

 options and critical dissent rather than to impose concurrence - seeking behaviour (see 

 Walter, 1986), ministerial staff have come to have the opposite effect, as we see above. 

 Their ability to intervene in departmental processes; to mediate between the political 

 and administrative domains; to drive, sieve and skew advice; to insist upon what the 

 minister wants as opposed to the public interest or the integrity of government has 

 amplified concern about public sector reform. It has provoked not only extensive 

 review of ministerial staff (Holland, 2002) and calls for accountability measures 

 (Holland, 2002; Keating, 2003b; Weller, 2002; Tiernan & Weller, 2003), but also a 

 reconsideration of and demand for greater security of tenure and strengthening of the 

 independence of departmental secretaries to act as a counterweight (Keating, 2003b). 

 The Howard government has not heeded these calls, but the ALP made reform of the 

 machinery of government an element in its 2004 campaign. 

 

 In summary, the conventions of political practice—in the traditional party democracy—

 might once have facilitated reasonably robust policy decisions. While no government 

 would perfectly have met the pattern of broad expectations, these expectations pushed 

 behaviour in certain ways. The need to connect a personal agenda with a broad 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  18   

 philosophy, to carry party followers with you by negotiated support (through, for 

 instance, party forums) and by showing how current action connects with common 

 goals, was one form of check on leadership caprice. The tradition of collective 

 authority and ministerial responsibility promoted debate, consensus and 

 accountability. The separation of politics and administration and the belief in the 

 function of the public service to deliver disinterested advice with a degree of 

 independence expanded options (there were always partisan sources whose inputs 

 could be weighed alongside those of the public service). All of the above imposed 

 threshold requirements—winning the party, gaining cabinet support, acknowledging 

 responsibility for decisions, balancing competing options from partisan and public 

 service advice—that were an incentive for periodic reality checks and a restraint on 

 leaders. The changes reviewed here have weakened those threshold requirements, 

 giving greater momentum to personalised leadership, while diminishing the incentive 

 for reality checks.  

 

 Prime ministerial personality 

 McAllister notes that the extent to which these institutional transitions bite depends on 

 a leader’s personality.  What is there to say about Howard’s personality and 

 leadership style?  In his conduct of politics, Howard has been variously described as 

 ‘dogged and determined’; as a ‘canny, controlling prime minister’; as having become 

 so dominant in his party ‘he can hang on as long as he wants’, ‘he owns the party’.  

 Rundle’s (2001) description of him as a ruthless, pragmatic opportunist, prepared to 

 do whatever it takes, is an element that must be acknowledged.  However, it does not 

 capture the fact that he has a consistent vision, or the fantasy of battle that underscores 

 his self-belief: Howard is, above all, self-identified as a Churchillian warrior: ‘I am the 

 bloke who ultimately wins the battle, and in political terms that is Churchill’. 

 

 Banal as this may seem, Judith Brett has shown how Howard, scorning the 

 intelligentsia, determinedly committed to plain speaking, has fashioned an 

 enormously powerful message that professes to speak for the ‘ordinary battler’, and to 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  19   

 advance the interests of ‘the mainstream’ and a common heritage against vested 

 interests (‘elites’), internal division, international challenge and foreign hostility (Brett, 

 2003).  Brett, no apologist for the right, argues persuasively that he is the most creative 

 conservative political leader since Menzies. 

 

 Notice, however, that Howard—who came to power arguing that he would create the 

 conditions where people could feel ‘comfortable and relaxed’—was a fighter from the 

 first: driving liberal ‘wets’ from his party (and expunging its Deakinite social - liberal 

 heritage); overthrowing the top echelons of the public service; turning the debate 

 about national identity into a notoriously combative ‘history war’ (see Macintyre and 

 Clark, 2003); sweeping Labor appointees on public authorities aside; questioning the 

 motives of leaders of the ‘Aboriginal industry’; insisting on the unity of the common 

 culture against multicultural incursions; and taking the battle to those ‘elites’ who, he 

 said, stood in the way of social progress.  He was the natural leader, then, to prosper 

 from the ‘securitisation’ agenda provoked, first, as illegal immigration was construed 

 as an attack on national sovereignty, then immensely amplified by the September 11 

 attacks (Howard was in Washington at the time), the ‘war on terror’ and the Iraq 

 invasion.  He was, in effect, a crisis leader who began to identify threats, articulate the 

 need to fight, institute tribal divisions between ‘them’ and ‘us’ and rally ‘the troops’ 

 well before international events accentuated the negatives.  When they did, as 

 McKenna argues, his natural propensities could be fused with the need for combat 

 leadership, and Howard emerged as the ‘wartime’ leader that had, as McKenna 

 shows, been his fantasy ideal. 

 Howard’s religious zeal for Anzac is unique.  In no other sphere of Australian 

 culture or politics does he betray the same depth of feeling or employ such 

 pious language … For John Howard, it is through the memory of war, and his 

 personal leadership of military engagement as prime minister, that the nation 

 finds its most meaningful expression … With Howard’s political supremacy has 

 come considerable hubris and much greater symbolic power invested in the 

 office of prime minister. (McKenna, 2003: 196-197). 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  20   

 

 We know this sort of leader: hard working, driven, controlling and moralistic. 

 Analysts like Barber (1972, on ‘active-negative’ leaders) and Little (1988) have shown 

 the underlying psychological constellation and how it fuses with political style: these 

 are the compulsives, given to work and worry, inclined to dominate through 

 moralistic rhetoric, externalising anger and hostility onto selected enemies, prone to 

 rigid world views, refusing compromise or surrender as an admission of weakness, 

 insisting on realism and decisive action.  Their approach has entailments: energy is 

 harnessed to overcoming obstacles—nature, human opponents or a pervasive if 

 unnamed crisis—‘all achievement is against the grain’ (Little, 1988); society is 

 conceived as structure, to be defended against dissent; there is ready resort to 

 manipulation—if you are in the right, what does it matter what methods are used?  

 Preoccupied with adversary politics and warring tribes, the leader’s message is yet one 

 of unity in the face of those who would divide us.  In Barber’s (1972) terms, the active-negative leader transforms policy problems ‘from a matter of calculation of results to a 

 matter of emotional loyalty to ideals… [His] view of reality must be accepted else the 

 cause fall apart’.  And Little (1988) adds, ‘A good deal of moralizing is used against the 

 foot-soldier who dares to put initiative against sheer obedience; initiative is for higher 

 ranks, like big crimes’. 

 

 Barber and Little, writing long before Howard’s ascension, capture the essence of his 

 style in their typologies.  Further, it seems to me arguable that there is a confluence 

 here between Howard’s own attributes and a series of institutional changes that 

 provided a context in which his style of leadership could flourish; this is what was 

 manifested in those modes of government action discussed earlier.  This brings me 

 back to McAllister’s point: the incipient trend towards enhanced prime ministerial 

 power can be ameliorated or augmented by a leader’s personality.  Howard, the ‘bloke 

 who wins the battle’, has significantly accelerated the trend.  And the ‘securitisation’ of 

 politics attendant on border protection, the Iraq invasion and the ‘war on terror’ has 

 been an additional accelerant.  Do both presage the renaissance of groupthink? 

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  21   

 

 Groupthink: the indicators 

 Irving Janis’s theory of groupthink (1972, 1982, 1989) is one of the most widely cited 

 models of political decision - making ever produced. It is also hotly contested (Aldag 

 and Fuller, 1993; Turner and Pratkanis, 1998). It is widely noted, however, that it 

 continues to recur because ‘the intuitive appeal of the groupthink concept and the 

 seductiveness of its formulation…overwhelm[s] the scientific evidence on the topic’ 

 (Turner and Pratkanis, 1998: 112).  How, indeed, could one replicate, say, the 

 complexity of children overboard and the government response, in a laboratory 

 setting?  Apart from ‘the intuitive appeal’ of groupthink in analysing the cases I’ve 

 discussed though, I am also guided by methodical attempts to tie the elements of 

 groupthink more closely to organisational theory and to the nexus between political 

 and bureaucratic decision - making (Preston and ‘t Hart, 1999). 

 

 Janis’s view was that high cohesiveness and a concurrence seeking tendency that 

 interferes with critical thinking are the central features of groupthink (Janis, 1982: 9).  

 Note that the active-negative leader, according to Barber (1972), is ‘likely either to 

 encourage members directly towards groupthink or to instil in them a fear of 

 recrimination that deters critical thinking just as effectively’ (Elms, 1976: 154), and 

 reflect on the serial failures of senior public servants to tell Howard and his ministers 

 when they were wrong, and their search against the odds to find evidence to support 

 the government’s story.  Even critics suggest that the variable that has most consistent 

 support is directive leadership: ‘…almost by definition, leader behaviors that promote 

 the leader’s own views and do not allow open exploration of alternatives will be 

 associated with groupthink defects such as incomplete survey of alternatives and 

 failure to reexamine preferred and rejected alternatives’ (Aldag and Fuller, 1993: 539).  

 Note, then, the failure of critical thinking in relation to the promulgation of the 

 children overboard story; or the directive leadership (Howard and Downer as 

 ‘cheerleaders’) and the refusal to consider alternatives in the selective utilisation of 

 intelligence assessments, as the case for war with Iraq was considered.   

 James Walter: Why Howard goes too far 

  Page  22   

 

 We can touch on other indicators: the drive for quick and painless unanimity on issues 

 the group has to confront (ONA’s capitulation on intelligence assessments when 

 ‘policy was running strongly’?); the suppression of personal doubts (the belief among 

 officers on the ground that the ‘chain of command’ would rectify mistakes, while their 

 seniors used the fact that they had not been at the scene as an excuse not to confront 

 issues); the belief in the inherent morality of the group (Howard, ‘I believed what I 

 was told, and we are all honourable men’); the perverse impact of ‘mindguards’ 

 (ministerial advisers as the ‘attack dogs’ of current orthodoxies); and a view of 

 opponents as evil.  ‘The results,’ says ‘t Hart, ‘are devastating: a distorted view of 

 reality … hasty and reckless policies, and a neglect of ethical issues’ (‘t Hart, 1991: 247). 

 

 Conclusion 

 The nexus in all of this is the relation between a leader and his/her advisory group.  

 Much of the research on bureaucratic/political decision-making indicates ‘the benefits 

 of duplication, overlap and competition’ (Preston and ‘t Hart, 1999: 51) in producing a 

 variety of possible options for consideration and preventing hasty closure and the 

 false consensus of groupthink.  Institutional and political practices in Westminster 

 party political systems arguably once served to constrain the groupthink dynamic.  

 The recent trend towards prime ministerial predominance has reduced the influence 

 of competition (within cabinet, between party forums and party leadership, between 

 partisans and public service advisors, between senior public servants and ministerial 

 staff).  The imperative for recurrent reality checks has been diminished.  A leader 

 whose own proclivities enhance the funnelling effect of more centralisation, tight inner 

 circles, closed systems and personal policy control may be especially prone to risky 

 decisions: decisions characterised by ‘oversimplification, isolationism and haste’ 

 (Preston and ‘t Hart, 1999: 69).  Conscious of such outcomes as being inherently 

 vulnerable to scrutiny, the inner circle will then resort to ethically dubious measures to 

 control information—as in each of the cases discussed above.

  Page  23   

 In this transitional context, a leader can capitalise on emerging trends and play by new 

 rules, but the political ethos remains governed by assumptions inherent to 

 Westminster systems: against these standards, such a leader may be seen to have gone 

 too far.  Whether specific accusations, such as those quoted at the beginning of this 

 paper, or the more general cynicism and disillusion that have been found to be 

 pervasive in the electorate (Pusey, 2003; Saunders, 2002) will see Howard defeated in 

 2004 remains a moot point.  He exemplifies a more general problem, and one inducing 

 voters to feel genuine perplexity—because of the transitional context—about whether 

 any alternative leader will behave differently. Latham has yet to convince us on this 

 score. The issue, finally, is whether the transitional politics I have described are 

 inherently conducive to groupthink, especially in the realm of foreign policy and 

 security decisions (since these are most fundamental to national well being and the 

 least amenable to broad, plural, representative interests).  If so, the question is not 

 whether Howard goes too far, but rather, what can we learn from this case about the 

 circumstances in which prime ministers will go too far?  In short, how can decision - 

 making practices and institutional reform be adjusted to produce better decisions and 

 to safeguard the qualities of integrity and accountability on which a democratic ethos 

 relies?
