 MEDIA RELEASE  Senator the Hon Joe Ludwig  Minister for Human Services   

 Monday 14 July 2008 

 

 

 

 Boost for Centrelink interpreters and translators   

 The Minister for Human Services, Joe Ludwig, has announced an increase in the fees  paid  for  on-site  interpreting  at  Centrelink  offices  and  for  translation  of  documents   required by Centrelink.   

 The increase will benefit interpreters and translators who provide Centrelink with on-call services in more than 200 languages.    

 "It's  vital  Centrelink  customers  from  non-English  speaking  backgrounds  continue  to   access quality interpreting and translation services," Senator Ludwig said.    

 "The  modest  fee  increase  is  well  overdue.  A  comprehensive  review  of  the  fee   structure  conducted  earlier  this  year  discovered  these  on-site  fees  have  been   unchanged for nearly ten years.  

 

 "In  deciding  to  commit  these  funds,  I  have  also  put  a  process  in  place  to  increase   interpreting  and  translation  fees  in  line  with  the  Consumer  Price  Index  (CPI)  each   financial year, commencing 1 July 2009.”   

 Senator  Ludwig  said  the  review  was  aimed  at  ensuring  the  continued  viability  of  a   quality interpreter and translator panel for Centrelink's business.    

 Centrelink  operates  an  in-house  interpreting  and  translation  service  to  assist  staff  to   communicate  with  non-English  speaking  customers  and  to  provide  translation  of   documents.   

 The  minimum  “standard”  and  “complex”  translation  fees  will  rise  by  around  $2.50,   while the minimum booking fee for on-site interpreting will increase by around $6.   

 These fees are paid by Centrelink to interpreters/translators selected from a panel of  2,500 around the country.    

 "More than a million of Centrelink's 6.5 million customers were born in a country that  does not speak English,” Senator Ludwig said.   

 “This investment of more than $300,000 will position Centrelink well for the challenges  ahead  as  refugees  and  migrants  from  Africa  bring  a  level  of  language  diversity  not   previously seen in Australia.”    

 

 

 

 

        "Centrelink has developed an extensive  range  of  services  for  customers  from   diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds.” 

         “These services include a bilingual recruitment strategy, a multi-lingual call centre,  dedicated  Multicultural  Services  Officers  and  an  extensive  multicultural   communication strategy, providing a large range of printed and on-line materials.”  

 "Access to free on-site interpreters and translators are crucial when assisting non-English speaking customers.”   

 "Centrelink  has  a  long-standing  and  well  deserved  reputation  for  excellence  in   multicultural  service  delivery.  Today's  announcement  will  ensure  these  standards   continue," Senator Ludwig said.
