 MEDIA RELEASE  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  ALEXANDER DOWNER   

 April 4 2004 

 Labor’s chaos extends to Afghanistan   

 Latham’s Labor has followed its chaotic cut-and-run policy on Iraq with more contradictory  policy-on-the-run over Afghanistan.   

 Labor says it would consider sending Australian troops back into Afghanistan. At the same  time Mark Latham says our troops are needed back from Iraq to make Australia a “safer and  sounder” nation.   

 Labor’s foreign policy spokesman Kevin Rudd today has highlighted past requests for  additional military assistance in Afghanistan. Last week he said Labor would “consider” any  such proposals.(Lateline 29/03/04 see below).   

 What is Labor’s true policy? Will it send more troops to Afghanistan or are they needed back  in Australia as Latham says?   

 In Berlin last week I attended an international conference on Afghanistan. Among leaders of  other countries engaged in Afghanistan and the broader war against terrorism, I met with  Afghanistan’s President Karzai and Foreign Minister Abdullah.   

 They remained grateful for Australia’s past military commitment to their country as well as  our ongoing $110 million aid program. Our policy is clear: Australia’s military deployment  has ended but we will continue to work with Afghanistan through our aid program which  covers such areas as education, refugee resettlement and combating illicit drug cultivation.   

 Labor needs to clearly outline its policy. Despite Latham’s failure to take up my offer of a  briefing on Australia’s Iraq deployment, I offer him a briefing on Afghanistan at a time of his  convenience.   

 Latham 26/3/04 Press Conference  We're much safer and sounder as a nation, and I'm sure the Australian people have been saying this in recent  times, having our troops here than on the other side of the world. And that's the reason why we're making this  commitment to have our troops back by Christmas.    

 Rudd (“Lateline” ABC TV 29/3/04)  TONY JONES: A very quick yes or no answer would a Labor Government contemplate sending Australian  troops to Afghanistan?  KEVIN RUDD: Our priorities at this stage, as far as the war against terrorism is concerned, in our own region,  our own neighbourhood and backyard. As far as any proposal we would receive on that score, well, we'd  consider it in due course.
