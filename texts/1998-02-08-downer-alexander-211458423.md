I am pleased to announce funding of $500,000 for Afghanistan's demining
program. This latest contribution from Australia will support landmine
clearance and awareness activities in the heavily mine-infested eastern
provinces of Afghanistan. This support will make a significant contribution
to allowing Afghan refugees on the Pakistan border return to their
homes.

 Australian funds will support the work of the United
Nations Mine Action Programme (UNMAP). This program was established in 1989
with Australian technical and financial assistance. Australian involvement
has continued over this period with Australian Government contributions
through AusAID totalling over $3.5 million since 1991. In addition, the past
three directors of the demining program have been Australian.

The UNMAP is considered to be one of the most cost effective demining
programs in the world. The cost of destroying a mine fell from US$300 in
1990 to US$110 in 1996.

 Afghanistan is one of the most heavily
mined countries in the world. Each day 10 Afghans are killed or maimed by
landmines. With 90 per cent of Afghanistan's mined areas in agriculture
fields, irrigation canals and grazing areas, the country's economic recovery
is not possible until the mines are removed.

 Since 1989, mines
have been cleared from 130 square kilometres of high priority contaminated
land, and 122 square kilometres of former battlefield.
