 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling No answers from Labor on an alleged  terrorist, murderer and drug dealer being  kept in low security immigration detention April 24, 2013

 Labor’s border protection failures have reached new lows with reports that an accused terrorist, an alleged drug smuggler  and a suspected murderer have all arrived here on asylum boats, yet the Minister for Immigration is still yet to answer why  they have been kept in low security detention and community detention, Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “It is shocking that an accused terrorist, who is the subject of a red notice from Interpol 1 , was being held in a low security  detention facility at Inverbrackie in the Adelaide Hills,” Mr Keenan said.

 “In the case of the alleged Sri Lankan murderer, the Government had apparently released him into community detention.

 “There will always be the possibility that people of bad character may cross our borders under Labor’s open borders  regime but the idea that we would then hold them in low security detention facilities or even more astoundingly release  them into the community is extraordinary.

 “These incidents have serious implications for Australia’s national security and the Minister for Immigration needs to  answer the following serious questions on how this was able to occur:

 ·         When was the Minister advised of these cases?

 ·         What action has been taken to assure appropriate security in these cases to manage the risk of flight into the  community?

 ·         For each case, when did the individual arrive and on what boat, where are they located now and what is the current  status of their refugee assessment?

 ·         How are these accusations being further investigated, by whom and what are the implications from the findings for  their refugee assessments?

 ·         Was the Minister aware that these individuals were being detained in low security detention facilities?

 ·         Did the Minister transfer the accused Egyptian terrorist from Inverbrackie detention facility to Villawood Detention  centre in response to the initial media report? 

 “When you have alleged criminals of such a serious nature being held in low security detention facilities or released into  the community, then the Australian people are owed an explanation how this was allowed to happen,” Mr Keenan said.

 1An Interpol Red Notice is the closest instrument to an international arrest warrant in use today. Interpol circulates notices  to member countries listing persons who are wanted for extradition (source United States Department of Justice).
