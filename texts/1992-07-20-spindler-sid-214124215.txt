 REFUGEES MUST HAVE ACCESS TO COURTS

 Senator Sid Spindler, Democrat Spokesperson on Ethnic Affairs,  today accused the Federal Government of not coming clean on a  recent Cabinet decision to remove the right of appeal for 

 decisions affecting the right of refugees to stay in Australia.

 "Since Friday, when this issue arose at a high profile conference  on human rights, the Government has still not provided a full and  satisfactory answer.

 "The Government seems bent on producing legislation which  excludes the right to judicial review, a perfect example being  legislation passed in the Senate on May 5 which excludes courts  from ordering the release of a 'designated person' in custody.  The Australian Democrats opposed this legislation which was  supported by both the Government and the Opposition.

 "The Australian Democrats are appalled at the Government's recent  performance of dealing with refugees which in many cases was  against obligations under international conventions.

 "I call on the Minister to come clean by providing full details  of any proposal to remove the right to appeal to a court, which  is a basic civil liberty, against a decision affecting a refugee.
