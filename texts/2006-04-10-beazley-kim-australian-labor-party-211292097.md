 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON KIM C BEAZLEY MP   

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, COMMONWEALTH  PARLIAMENTARY OFFICES, BRISBANE, 10 APRIL 2006   

 E & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:   Cole Royal Commission; Industrial Relations; Uranium;  Immigration   

 BEAZLEY: This AWB scandal goes all the way to the top.  What the Prime  Minster has got to do is to front the Royal Commission and through them, explain  to the young Australian men and women, who are laying their lives on the line in  Iraq, how his own personal sloth and incompetence has allowed a situation  where Australia ended up funding Saddam Hussein.  Now, that is the bare  minimum of what the Prime Minister should be revealing to the Australian public,  and particularly to the young men and women, who are paying the price for the 

 incompetence of this Government.    

 It is absolutely vital now that the Prime Minister foregoes the rorted terms of  reference that have been handed to the Royal Commission.  It is absolutely  essential now that the Prime Minister gives a term of reference to the Cole  Commission, which means not only are AWB executives held accountable, but  he, John Howard and his Ministers, properly account for the laws that they failed  to uphold.   

 Now, there’s another witness appearing before the Cole Commission and some  of her evidence is in the paper today and she’s talking about UN Resolution 661.   So, let me say this about her evidence. What this evidence shows absolutely  clearly is the Commonwealth Government was responsible for upholding the  sanctions, not for undermining them, personally responsible for upholding them.   They failed.  They failed and as a result of that they betrayed the hundreds of  young Australian men and women, who themselves, were laying their lives on  the line, upholding the sanctions in the Persian Gulf and then ultimately, betrayed  the young Australian that they sent to war,   

 You cannot do anything more serious than this as a Prime Minister of this nation.   And he now owes the Australian people a total, complete and full accounting of it.   This scandal goes all the way to the top.   

 

 As we’re also talking about these things, the wretched impact of their Industrial  Relations laws, the Americanisation of our labour laws is passing its way through 

 the system.  And it’s hit a young lady named Amber Oswald in Sydney.  Mums  and dads know that John Howard’s industrial relations laws are throwing their  children to the wolves.  Mums and dads know that Howard’s industrial relations  laws are throwing their kids to the wolves.     

 Now, I’m going to rip these laws up.  And I’m going to make absolutely certain  that young people in our workforce, all people in our workforce, have their rights,  their dignity and ability to earn a decent income absolutely supported by the  industrial relations system.  It’s not now.  Howard’s Americanised our industrial  laws and in doing so he’s thrown our kids to the wolves.  He’s introduced job  insecurity for everybody.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, as I understand it the terms of the Royal  Commission are that they can look at what the Government knew but not at what  the actions the Government took.  Is that what you’re asking for?   

 BEAZLEY:  In the end the Royal Commission cannot hold the  Government accountable.  I think Australians out there believe that a bare  minimum that would come from this Royal Commission would be a statement of  judgment about the competency of the Government and whether or not the  Government upheld its obligations in international law in Australian law.  But in  fact the Royal Commission can’t find in those areas.  So, anything we pick up  from the evidence of Howard and Downer and Vaile in the witness box, anything  that we pick up from them really goes, in the final analysis, to the culpability of  AWB, when really it should go to the culpability of themselves.   

 JOURNALIST: Is this acceptable?   

 BEAZLEY:  No, it is not acceptable.  This scandal goes all the way to the  top and at the top there should be a complete accounting.  This is what is now  required and a complete accounting means that instead of rorted terms of  reference you get full terms of reference.  Holding the Government accountable  in all of this.  But Howard’s got to come clean and look, we owe it, as a people, to  the young men and women whom we asked to put their lives on the line, most of  them, or many of them come from my electorate by the way in Western Australia,  that’s from where the Navy operates and has operated for more than a decade in  the Persian Gulf.  Now, I’ve been out there with them on occasions, this was  before the war, and I’ve seen the young men and women do the things that put  their lives on the line in upholding the sanctions on Saddam.  And, this slothful,  incompetent Government allowed their hard work to be fundamentally  undermined and they’ve got to be accountable.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you believe the Prime Minister will come clean?  Are  you confident with this will achieve anything?   

 BEAZLEY:  Unless we get a full-blown change in the terms of reference,  we’ll never get to the bottom of all this.  But it’s a good thing that he has to  appear and he should go beyond the terms of reference and the strict accounting  required of him in these limited terms of reference to give the Australian people a  full accounting in the witness box.  The Australian people would expect no less of  him.   

 JOURNALIST: He’s keeping his statement private until it goes to the full  inquiry, is that the right thing to do?   

 BEAZLEY:  No.  The Prime Minister owes, in the first instance in  accounting, not to the Royal Commissioner but to the Australian people.  We  have asked him hundreds of questions - Kevin Rudd’s been doing a fantastic job  on this, holding this Government accountable.  We, in the Opposition, have been  asking them question after question in the Parliament.  They have misled, they  have turned their backs on all those accountability processes. Time now Mr  Howard, for a bit of honesty, for the Australian people.   A bit of accountability on  your part for your sloth and incompetence in allowing Saddam Hussein to be  funded by Australia at the same time as you’re asking young Australians to put  their lives on the line, upholding sanctions.     

 JOURNALIST: What are you expecting out of Mark Vaile and Alexander  Downer this week?   

 BEAZLEY:  Well, I hope we get out of them the truth because that’s what  the Australian people expect of them.  Again, as with Howard, they’ve got to tell  the truth outside simply just their very limited terms of reference that Mr Cole has.   They’ve got to do what the Australian people think is going on here and that is  the Government giving a full accounting of their failures.  That’s what they’ve got  to do along with John Howard.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, would you oppose any move at the Labor  Conference to scrap the three mines policy on uranium?   

 BEALZEY:  We’re going to have a debate on uranium at the next  Conference in the Labor Party and I’ve made absolutely clear what my views are  on this.  I’ve said repeatedly - and there’ll be time enough to debate this at that  Conference - this is not an urgent matter.  But I’ve said repeatedly that I don’t  think it’s so much a question of how the uranium is dug up or who digs it up - it’s 

 a question of the terms and conditions on which it is sold.  Now, the Australian  people understand this instinctively about uranium, it is not a product like any  other.  It is something that is capable of being used for great good in providing 

 energy supplies to people around the world and it is something that is capable of  being used for unbelievable evil if it gets into the wrong hands and is used in the  wrong way.  Australian people have an understandable reticence about all of this  and they’re entitled to get from the Labor Party, and they will, a sensible policy in 

 terms of its export and its utilisation and they’ll be plenty of time at the next  Conference to do this.   

 Even Macfarlane, the Industry Minister, came out the other day and said: well,  we’ve got enough uranium in both the foreshadowed changes in the mines that  are already in existence and being produced now to uphold our obligations on  export for years to come.  So, in those circumstances, I’m not going to follow  John Howard’s trick who wants to stop us talking about AWB, stop us talking us  talking about industrial relations.  Start us talking about something that will be  resolved anyway in a year’s time.   

 JOURNALIST: What do you thing about the national interest test being  applied to refugee applicants?   

 BEAZLEY:  We have got good, tough laws in relation to the issues of  your claimant’s status as a potential refugee to this country.  What we don’t have  is decent enforcement - we absolutely need a Coast Guard.  We, who come from  Queensland and Western Australia, understand this, our northern waters are  being constantly encroached on for illegal purposes - you need a Coast Guard.   But the point is this. Australians should determine Australian laws in relation to  refugee status or any other aspect of the immigration program.  Those laws  should not be handed to a determination by anyone else.
