 CHRIS BOWEN MP 

 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP   

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 21 May 2012 

 

 MUDDLED MORRISON JUST CAN’T GET FIGURES RIGHT   

 The shadow minister who served up dodgy Nauru processing centre costings from a catering  company has struck again, this time blatantly inflating the number of people in immigration  detention to score cheap political points.   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, said Scott Morrison seemed  to be getting in the habit of making up facts where the truth didn’t suit his argument.   

 “Mr Morrison’s scaremongering and politicisation of asylum seeker issues knows no bounds,  to the point that he is willing to say things that just aren’t true,” Mr Bowen said.   

 Mr Morrison said in Parliament today that, “There are as many people in the detention  network today as there were when they set fire to the immigration detention facilities in  March 2011.”   

 This is patently untrue. Around the time of the incidents at Christmas Island in the middle of  March 2011, there were around 6,600 people in detention facilities across the network.    

 As at 20 March 2012, there were about 4,800 people in detention facilities across the  network - that’s about 1,800 fewer people than in March 2011. And that is all people held in  detention facilities, not just people arriving by boat.   

 “Mr Morrison has got his figures wrong again. And he seems to want there to be trouble in  the detention network, because like having more boats arriving, he and Tony Abbott think  it’s in their best political interests,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “Well he can’t have it both ways. Mr Morrison doesn’t support community placement and he  refuses to support offshore processing legislation, yet he and Mr Abbott happily stand in the  way of solutions to stop the flow of boats and reduce the number of people in detention.   

 “At the very least he should check his facts, and stop the misinformation campaign.”
