 AUSTRALIA WELCOMES THE INAUGURATION OF THE INTERIM AUTHORITY IN AFGHANISTAN

 The Australian Government welcomes the inauguration of the new Interim Authority in Afghanistan.  This highlights the impressive progress that has been made in a very short time towards restoring that country to peace and stability.

 To demonstrate Australia’s support and commitment, I am pleased to announce that Australia will contribute $1 million to the new Interim Authority through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) established and managed Afghan Interim Authority Fund. Our contribution will help provide the new Authority with staff and much needed basic resources such as office equipment.

 The Interim Authority, established by a UN conference hosted by the Government of Germany earlier this month, will pave the way for political transition in Afghanistan to an elected government.  The Australian Government congratulates the UN Secretary General’s Special Envoy, Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, and Afghan participants on their excellent work.

 Australia recognises that the humanitarian problems within Afghanistan and the South West Asian region are enormous but believes that the outlook is improving.  In supporting the Interim Authority, Australia will help provide the framework for reconstruction and improved security to enable displaced Afghans to return home and contribute to rebuilding their devastated country.

 Australia has already committed $23.3 million in humanitarian assistance to Afghan refugees and displaced people in Afghanistan and South West Asia.  The $23.3 million includes $5 million to the World Food Programme for food aid.  An allocation of $4 million has been made to UNHCR to provide protection for and assistance to displaced Afghans. A total of $4 million has been given to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, International Organisation for Migration, Care Australia, Australian Red Cross, UNICEF Australia and Oxfam/Community Aid Abroad.

 Further Australian assistance will be considered in the context of an Afghan Reconstruction Needs Assessment being undertaken by the UNDP, World Bank and Asian Development Bank for a donor coordination and pledging meeting in Tokyo in January.
