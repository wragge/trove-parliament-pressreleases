 UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS DETECTED 

 A surveillance flight conducted by a Border Protection Command helicopter has detected  four people suspected to be unauthorised arrivals on Deliverance Island, approximately 30  nautical miles off the coast of Papua New Guinea. 

 The four adult males have been transferred by helicopter to Customs and Border Protection  temporary detention facilities on Horn Island, where they will be formally detained by DIAC  officers. 

 They will undergo health, security and other checks to establish their identity and reasons for  their voyage and further decisions on processing will be made in due course. 

 The men were not accompanied by a vessel and the circumstances of their arrival are yet to  be determined. 

 Deliverance Island is an offshore excised place under the Migration Act. 

 The Rudd Government has maintained the system of excision so that unauthorised arrivals at  excised offshore places cannot apply for a refugee visa under the Migration Act unless they  raise claims that prima facie may engage Australia's protection  obligations. 

 Claims are assessed against the requirements of the Refugees Convention and people found  to be owed protection will be allowed to apply for a permanent visa while those found not to  be owed protection will be removed.
