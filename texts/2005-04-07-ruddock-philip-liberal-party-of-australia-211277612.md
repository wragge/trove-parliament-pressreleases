 ATTORNEY-GENERAL  THE HON PHILIP RUDDOCK MP 

 

 NEWS RELEASE   

 

 7 April 2005 057/2005

 

 GOVERNMENT RELISTS SIX TERRORIST ORGANISATIONS   

 The Australian Government will re-list six groups as terrorist organisations under Australia’s  counter-terrorism laws, the Attorney-General Philip Ruddock announced today.   

 The organisations re-listed are Lashkar-e Jhangvi (LeJ), Asbat al-Ansar, Egyptian Islamic  Jihad, Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, Jaish-e-Mohammad and the Islamic Army of Aden.   

 Australia’s laws provide that the listing of a terrorist organisation ceases to have effect two  years after a listing is made.  The organisations were originally listed on 11 April 2003 and  this listing was due to sunset on 11 April 2005.   

 “The Government has decided to re-list these groups as I continue to be satisfied on  reasonable grounds that they are directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning,  assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act,” Mr Ruddock said.   

 The re-listing of the organisations ensures the offence provisions under Division 102 of the  Criminal Code Act 1995 (the Criminal Code) continue to apply in relation to each  organisation.   

 It means it will continue to be an offence to belong to or associate with, direct, recruit for,  train with or provide training for, and receive funds from or make funds available to these  terrorist organisations, whether in Australia or abroad.   

 “Members of listed terrorist organisations are committing a serious criminal offence and face  prosecution and penalties of up to 25 years imprisonment,” Mr Ruddock said.   

 “The re-listing confirms the Government’s commitment to ensuring that involvement in these  organisations will not be tolerated.   

 “Australia’s law enforcement agencies will continue to pursue those who commit terrorist  offences under the full letter of the law,” he said.

 ATTACHMENT A 

 Asbat al-Ansar  (Also known as Usbat al-Ansar, Osbat al-Ansar) 

 The following information is based on publicly available details about Asbat al-Ansar  (League of Partisans). These details have been corroborated by material from intelligence  investigations into the activities of the Asbat al-Ansar and by official reporting.  ASIO  assesses that the details set out below are accurate and reliable. 

 Asbat al-Ansar has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation in Australia, and by the United  Nations and the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. 

 Background 

 Asbat al-Ansar is a Lebanon-based Sunni Islamic extremist group that follows the same  fundamentalist interpretation of Islam as al-Qa’ida, with which it is affiliated. Asbat al-Ansar  was established in the early 1990s and is primarily based in the Ayn al-Hilwah Palestinian  refugee camp near Sidon in southern Lebanon. The group has a smaller presence in the Nahr 

 al-Bared refugee camp outside Tripoli and has been active in Sidon, Beirut and the Dinniyeh  plateau, north Lebanon. To date, Asbat al-Ansar’s area of operations has been limited to  Lebanon. 

 Since the early 1990s Asbat al-Ansar has conducted numerous attacks against targets in  Lebanon that it regards as ‘un-Islamic’. These include elements of the Lebanese government,  foreign nationals, foreign owned businesses, churches, bars, theatres and casinos. The group  has also been involved in numerous attacks on rival Palestinian and Islamic group members. 

 It is reported that Asbat al-Ansar is affiliated with the international al-Qai’da network from  which it has received funding, and the group has also reportedly received funding from the  Abu Mus’ab al-Zarqawi network. The group also has links to other Sunni Islamic groups  operating in Lebanon. These include the al-Dinniyah group, Takfir wal Hijra, Asbat al-Nur,  and Jund al-Sham which in turn have links to Abu Mus’ab al-Zarqawi’s network. 

 Objectives 

 Asbat al-Ansar’s objective is the establishment of a radical Sunni Islamic state in Lebanon.  The group’s goals include overthrowing the Lebanese government and preventing what they  perceive as anti-Sunni Islamic influences in Lebanon. 

 Leadership and membership 

 Asbat al-Ansar is led by Ahmed Abd al-Karim al-Saadi (also known as Abu Muhjin/Abu  Muhjen/Abu Mahjen). Al-Saadi has been sentenced to death by Lebanese authorities for the  1995 murder of Sheikh Nizar al-Halabi, the former leader of the Islamic Charity Projects  Association (also known as the Ahbash movement). Since Al-Saadi’s disappearance in 1999  the group has been nominally led by his brother Abu Tariq. 

 Although the exact number is not known, Asbat al-Ansar has an estimated strength of  between 100 and 200 active members, most of whom are Palestinian refugees. Training and  recruitment are primarily conducted within the Ayn al-Hilwa refugee camp.

 Terrorist activities 

 Asbat al-Ansar has been involved in a number of terrorist attacks, including shootings,  grenade attacks, and the use of improvised explosive devices against the Lebanese  government, foreign nationals, rival Palestinian groups, nightclubs, theatres, liquor stores and  Western fast food restaurants. 

 On the basis of available information we assess that the incidence of terrorist attacks by Asbat  al-Ansar has declined. However, we assess that core members of Asbat al-Ansar remain  active, maintain links to al-Qa’ida and Sunni extremist groups, including al-Zarqawi’s  network, and retain the intent to carry out terrorist activities. 

 Terrorist attacks for which responsibility has been claimed by, or reliably attributed to, Asbat  al-Ansar, have included: 

 â¢ Assassinations of Lebanese religious leaders and political figures and the bombing of  several nightclubs, theatres and liquor stores in the mid-1990s; 

 â¢ the 8 June 1999 attack on a court house in Sidon that killed four judges; 

 â¢ the 8 September 1999 bombing of the Customs Department office in Sidon; 

 â¢ the January 3 2000 rocket-propelled grenade attack on the Russian embassy in Beirut; 

 â¢ the bombing of a church in Sidon on 17 October 2001; 

 â¢ the 2001 grenade attacks on Lebanese army posts in Sidon; 

 â¢ murder of a US missionary in Sidon on 21 November 2002; and 

 â¢ the 2002 and 2003 attacks on Western fast food restaurants around Lebanon. 

 Conclusion 

 ASIO assesses that Asbat al-Ansar is continuing to prepare, plan and foster the commission of  acts involving threats to human life and serious damage to property.  This assessment is  corroborated by information provided by reliable and credible intelligence sources. 

 In the course of pursuing its objective of creating a radical Sunni Islamic state in Lebanon,  Asbat al-Ansar is known to have engaged in actions that: 

 â¢ are aimed at advancing Asbat al-Ansar’s political and religious causes; 

 â¢ are intended to, or do, cause serious damage to property, the death of persons or  endangerment of life. 

 â¢ done with the intention of coercing or influencing by intimidation the government and  people of Lebanon; and 

 4 

 â¢ are intended to cause, or have caused, serious risk to the safety of sections of the  public in Lebanon and other persons visiting areas in which it operates. 

 In view of the above information, Asbat al-Ansar is assessed to be directly or indirectly  preparing, planning, and fostering the conduct of terrorist acts.  Such acts include actions  which are to be done and threats of actions which are to be made with the intention of  advancing a political, religious or ideological cause and with the intention of coercing, or  influencing by intimidation the Government and people of Lebanon.  The actions or  threatened actions which Asbat al-Ansar are assessed to be involved in would, if successfully  completed, cause serious physical harm and death to persons and serious damage to property.

 The Islamic Army of Aden (IAA)  (Also known as: Aden Abyan Islamic Army (AAIA), Islamic Army of Aden Abayan) 

 The following information is based on publicly available details about the Islamic Army of  Aden (IAA). These details have been corroborated by material from intelligence  investigations into the activities of the IAA and by official reporting.  ASIO assesses that the  details set out below are accurate and reliable.  

 The IAA has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation in Australia, and by the United  Nations and the governments of the United Kingdom and Canada. 

 Background 

 The Yemen-based IAA was formed by a splinter group of the Yemeni Islamic Jihad in 1996.   The IAA is a Sunni extremist group that first came to public prominence in May 1998 when it  issued statements detailing its intention to overthrow the Yemeni government and implement  Sharia law.  However, the group is believed to have developed during the early 1990s and  members of what was to become the IAA were implicated in a series of attacks against US  interests with the aim of forcing the withdrawal of US bases in Yemen supporting US  operations in Somalia. 

 The IAA is associated with al-Qa’ida, which has a presence in Yemen, and has made public  statements in support of Usama Bin Laden, al-Qa’ida and its terrorist activities. 

 The IAA predominantly operates in the southern governorates of Yemen - primarily Aden  and Abyan. It uses bombings and kidnappings as a means of furthering its goals. In 1998, the  IAA kidnapped 16 British, Australian and American tourists. Four tourists, including one  Australian, were killed during a rescue attempt. The IAA also claimed responsibility for the  suicide bomb attack against the USS Cole on 12 October 2000. 

 Objectives 

 The IAA aims to overthrow the current Yemeni government and establish an Islamist form of  government, to remove all Western influence from Yemen and to support al-Qa’ida’s efforts  regionally in the global jihad. 

 Leadership and membership 

 The IAA’s founder and former leader Zein al-Abidine al-Mihdar (aka Abu al-Hassan) was  executed in 1999 for his role in the 1998 kidnapping of 16 Western tourists. Al-Mihdar and  other founding members were veterans of the struggle in Afghanistan against the Soviets. The 

 current leader is Khaled Abdennabi (aka Khalid ‘Abd al-Nabi al-Yazidi). 

 The group is small, with an estimated 100 core members, which includes Yemenis and Saudis  organised in cells. The group also has supporters among Yemeni tribes. The IAA employs  kidnapping as a means of raising money through ransom and to apply pressure to the Yemeni  government. This is also a traditional method for raising funds in Yemen by non-terrorist and  tribal groups. Members of the IAA are also believed to reside in the United Kingdom, Sudan,  Pakistan, Jordan and Eritrea. 

 6 

 Terrorist activities 

 The IAA has been involved in a number of terrorist attacks against Yemeni government and  Western targets. The attacks have employed a number of different methods, including  bombing and kidnapping. Given the effectiveness and intensity of US supported counter-terrorism efforts in Yemen, the IAA’s ability to conduct terrorist attacks has been  significantly diminished.  However, the group retains the capability and intent to undertake  terrorist acts. 

 Terrorist attacks and activities for which the IAA has claimed responsibility or for which  responsibility has been reliably attributed to IAA have included:  

 â¢ August 2002: three Yemenis belonging to the IAA were convicted of carrying out  bombing attacks in the southern port of Aden on 1 January 2001; 

 â¢ 17 October2002: Islamist extremist and reported spiritual leader of the IAA Abu-Hamzah  al-Masri announced that the IAA had joined al-Qa’ida; 

 â¢ 21 June 2003: attack a military medical convoy, wounding 7 soldiers; 

 â¢ June 2003: arrest of four alleged IAA members and seizure of a car packed with hand  grenades, explosives and rocket-propelled grenades that had been used in the attack on a  military medical convoy 21 June 2003; 

 â¢ 25 June 2003: clash between IAA members and government troops at the group’s hideout  in Harat - captured IAA members revealed they were waiting for orders to carry out  terrorist operations; and 

 â¢ 1 October 2003: alleged IAA car bomb attack against the US, UK and German embassies  in Sana'a was disrupted. 

 Conclusion 

 ASIO assesses that the IAA is continuing to prepare, plan and foster the commission of acts  involving threats to human life and serious damage to property.  This assessment is based on  publicly available details about the Islamic Army of Aden (IAA), which have been 

 corroborated by information provided by reliable and credible intelligence sources and by  official reporting. 

 In the course of pursuing its objectives of overthrowing the Yemeni Government and  replacing it with an Islamic state, removing all Western influence from Yemen, and  supporting al-Qa’ida’s efforts regionally in the global jihad, the IAA is known to have  engaged in actions that: 

 â¢ are aimed at advancing the IAA’s political and religious causes; 

 â¢ are intended to, or do, cause serious damage to property, the death of persons or  endangerment of life; 

 7 

 â¢ done with the intention of coercing or influencing by intimidation the governments  and people of numerous countries; and 

 â¢ are intended to cause, or have caused, serious risk to the safety of sections of the  public in Yemen and other persons visiting areas in which it operates. 

 In view of the above information, the IAA is assessed to be directly or indirectly preparing,  planning, and fostering the conduct of terrorist acts.  Such acts include actions which are to be  done and threats of actions which are to be made with the intention of advancing a political,  religious or ideological cause and with the intention of coercing, or influencing by  intimidation the Government and people of Yemen.  The actions or threatened actions which  the IAA are assessed to be involved in would, if successfully completed, cause serious  physical harm and death to persons and serious damage to property.

 Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan  (Also known as: IMU, Islamic Party of Turkestan, Islamic Movement of Turkestan) 

 The following background information is based on publicly available details about the Islamic  Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU). These details have been corroborated by material from  intelligence investigations overseas into the IMU’s activities and official reporting. ASIO  assesses that the details set out below are accurate and reliable. 

 The IMU has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation in Australia, and the United Nations  and the governments of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. 

 Background 

 The IMU was founded in 1997 and is a coalition of Islamic extremists from Uzbekistan and  other Central Asian states who oppose the current Uzbek regime. The IMU’s area of  operation includes Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan. 

 In May 2001, the group announced that it had changed its name to the Islamic Party of  Turkestan. The motivation for this is unclear, although it could reflect divisions in the group  or signals a change in emphasis from anti-Uzbek government activities to a wider radical  Islamic agenda. The organisation has, however, continued to be known as the IMU. Despite 

 IMU’s losses in Afghanistan during the US intervention in 2002, it remains active and  continues to attract recruits from throughout the region. The IMU’s propaganda has always  included anti-Western and anti-Israeli rhetoric. The group’s tactics include hostage-taking  (including foreigners), assassination, car and suicide bombing. 

 The IMU has close ties with al-Qa’ida and the former Taliban government. IMU fighters have  trained in camps in Afghanistan, some controlled by al-Qa’ida. IMU members have been  trained by al-Qa’ida instructors in guerrilla warfare, sabotage, bomb making, assassination 

 and urban terrorism. The IMU has received funding from al-Qa’ida. Senior IMU leaders have  held positions in the al-Qa’ida hierarchy. 

 Objectives 

 The IMU initially sought to overthrow the Uzbek regime and establish an Islamic state.  However, by 2000, the IMU had broadened its goals to include the establishment of a radical  Islamic caliphate in Turkestan, encompassing an area from the Caspian region to Xinjiang in  western China. 

 Leadership and membership 

 The IMU’s political and ideological leader is believed to be Tahir Yoldashev, and the group’s  overall military commander is Joma Namangani. The latter was reported killed in the fighting  in Afghanistan in 2002 but his death remains unconfirmed. He held a position in the Taliban  government prior to its fall and was reportedly one of Usama Bin Laden’s deputies in 2001. 

 The IMU attracts support from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, principally - Uzbeks, Kyrgyz,  Tajiks, Kazakhs, Chechens and Uighurs from western China. The IMU’s membership is 

 9 

 believed to number under 2000. These are divided into brigades (comprised of approximately  40-50 men) made up according to ethnic background. 

 Terrorist activities 

 The IMU has been involved in a number of terrorist attacks against Western diplomatic  facilities and civilian targets in Central Asia, and IMU members continue to fight alongside  the Taliban and al-Qa’ida against Coalition and Pakistani forces in Afghanistan and northern  Pakistan. Terrorist attacks and activities for which the IMU has claimed responsibility or for  which responsibility has been reliably attributed to IMU have included: 

 â¢  May 2003: bomb attack in the city of Osh in southern Kyrgyzstan; 

 â¢ 29 March 2004: bomb attacks against a shopping centre in Tashkent and an apartment  building in Bukhara killing 19 and wounding 26 people; and 

 â¢ 30 July 2004: bomb attacks against the Israeli and US embassies in Tashkent, killing  three and wounding nine people. 

 Conclusion 

 ASIO assesses that the IMU is continuing to prepare, plan and foster the commission of acts  involving threats to human life and serious damage to property. Although the organisation  suffered significant loses during the Afghanistan conflict, it has attracted recruits from a 

 variety of countries within the region, and has a history of working with other international  terrorist organisations from which it may draw support.  This assessment is corroborated by  information provided by reliable and credible intelligence sources and by official reporting.  This assessment is based on reliable and credible intelligence provided by intelligence sources  and official reporting. 

 In the course of pursuing its objective of establishing a radical Islamist caliphate in Turkestan  the IMU is known to have engaged in and planned actions that: 

 â¢ are aimed towards advancing its political and religious causes; 

 â¢ are intended to, or do, cause serious damage to property, the death of persons or  endangerment of life;  

 â¢ done with the intention of coercing or influencing by intimidation the governments and  people of numerous countries; and 

 â¢ are intended to cause, or have caused, serious risk to the safety of Uzbek officials and  civilians, and any other person visiting areas in which it operates. 

 In view of the above information, the IMU is assessed to be continuing to prepare, plan, assist  and foster the conduct of further terrorist acts. Such acts include actions which are to be done  and threats of actions which are to be made with the intention of advancing political, religious  or ideological cause, or influencing by intimidation, the government of Uzbekistan and other  countries. The actions which IMU is assessed to be involved would, if completed  successfully, cause serious harm and death to persons and serious damage to property.

 Jaish-e-Mohammad  (Also known as Jaish-i-Mohammad, Jesh-e-Mohammadi, Jaish-e-Mohammad-e-Tanzeem, Tehrik-al-Furgan, Tehrik-al-Furqaan, Khuddam-ul-Islam, Army of  Mohammad) 

 The following information is based on publicly available details about Jaish-e-Mohammad  (JeM).  These details have been corroborated by material from intelligence investigations into  the activities of JeM and by official reporting.  ASIO assesses that the details set out below  are accurate and reliable.  

 The JeM has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation in Australia, and by the United  Nations and the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Pakistan and  India. 

 Background 

 JeM is a Sunni Islamist extremist organisation founded in December 1999.  It is based in  Pakistan, primarily in Peshawar and Muzaffarabad, and it operates mainly in Kashmir.  It has,  however, staged attacks outside Kashmir in other parts of India.  

 JeM primarily targets Indian security (military or police) personnel and bases although it has  also attacked civilian targets such as the attack on the Indian Parliament building in New  Delhi in 2002.  In its attacks, JeM typically uses car bombs, grenades, ambushes or  landmines.  JeM was also involved in the abduction and murder of US journalist Daniel Pearl 

 in January 2002.  A member of JeM was later charged with his murder. 

 JeM draws heavily from Harakat-ul-Mujahideen (HUM, now known as Jamiat ul-Ansar- JuA). Many of its members as well as a range of property (including weapons), business and  charitable interests were originally sourced from HUM.  In addition to its alliances with other 

 Jihadist groups, JeM is supported by a number of Islamic charitable foundations including the  al-Rashid Trust (whose accounts were ordered to be frozen by the UN Security Council for  suspected links to al-Qai’da). 

 Objectives 

 JeM aims to unite Indian-controlled Kashmir with Pakistan and establish a radical Islamist  state in Pakistan. It also aims to expel Shias, Christians, Hindus and Jews from Pakistan. 

 Leadership and membership 

 JeM is led by Maulana Masood Azhar, who founded the group upon his release from prison in  India.  He remains the group’s Amir and presides over a leadership council.  In addition to its  close association with HUM, JeM also maintains links to other militant Islamist groups, most 

 notably Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (with whom it has conducted joint operations), Lashkar-e-Jhangvi  (LeJ), al-Qai’da, and the Taliban.   

 JeM has approximately seven hundred members, comprised mostly of Pakistanis and  Kashmiris but also includes some Arabs and Afghans. JeM organises recruitment drives  through rallies and political demonstrations.  It benefits from training programs that were first 

 11 

 created by HUM and has run its own training facilities in Afghanistan, although these were  disbanded in 2001.  JeM may also have assisted al-Qa’ida in establishing training camps in  Yemen and Somalia. 

 Terrorist activities 

 JeM has been involved in a number of terrorist attacks, including kidnapping, car bomb and  shooting attacks primarily against Indian military, police and civilian targets, as well as the  abduction and murder of US journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002. 

 Recent terrorist attacks for which responsibility has been claimed by, or reliably attributed to,  JeM have included:  

 â¢ December 2003: attempted assassination of Pakistani President Musharraf by car bomb. 

 â¢ 27 August 2003: exchange of fire between JeM members and Indian troops near  Sanzwatri village in Pulwama district in which one militant was killed and one soldier  was injured. 

 â¢ 1 September 2004: bomb attack in a bazaar in Quetta in which 3 people were killed and 7  were injured. 

 â¢ 25 October 2004: attack on the Divisional Commissioner for the Kashmir Valley. 

 â¢ 13 November 2004: attack by JeM militants wearing army uniforms on a police picket in  Nadimarg. 

 Conclusion 

 ASIO assesses that JeM is continuing to prepare, plan and foster the commission of acts  involving threats to human life and serious damage to property.  This assessment is  corroborated by information provided by reliable and credible intelligence sources and by  official reporting.  

 In the course of pursuing its objectives of creating a radical Islamist state in Pakistan and  unite Indian-controlled Kashmir with Pakistan, the JeM is known to have engaged in actions  that: 

 â¢ are aimed at advancing the JeM’s political and religious causes;  

 â¢ are intended to, or do, cause serious damage to property, the death of persons or  endangerment of life; 

 â¢ done with the intention of coercing or influencing by intimidation the governments  and people of numerous countries; and 

 â¢ are intended to cause, or have caused, serious risk to the safety of sections of the  public in Pakistan and India and other persons visiting areas in which it operates. 

 12 

 In view of the above information, JeM is assessed to be directly or indirectly preparing,  planning, and fostering the conduct of terrorist acts.  Such acts include actions which are to be  done and threats of actions which are to be made with the intention of advancing a political,  religious or ideological cause and with the intention of coercing, or influencing by  intimidation the Government and people of JeM.  The actions or threatened actions which the  JeM are assessed to be involved in would, if successfully completed, cause serious physical  harm and death to persons and serious damage to property.

 Lashkar-e Jhangvi (LeJ)  (Also known as: Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, Lashkar-e-Jhangvie, Laskar-e-Jhangvi, Lashkare  Jhangvi, Lashkar-e-Jhangwi, Lashkar-i-Jhangwi, Jhangvi Army, Lashkar-e Jhangvi,  Lashkar Jhangvi, Lashkar-e-Jhanvi, Lashkar-i-Jangvi, Lashkar e Jhangvi, Lashkar  Jangvi, Laskar e Jahangvi). 

 The following information is based on publicly available details about Lashkar-e Jhangvi  (LeJ). These details have been corroborated by material from intelligence investigations into  the activities of the LeJ and official reporting. ASIO assesses that the details set out below are  accurate and reliable. 

 The LeJ has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation in Australia, and by the United  Nations and the governments of the United States, Canada and Pakistan.  

 Background 

 Lashkar-e Jhangvi (LeJ) is a Sunni Islamic terrorist group based in Pakistan. The group was  formed in 1996 as a more militant splinter group of the radical sectarian organisation, the  Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) and follows the Deobandi tradition of Sunni Islam. Under the  leadership of Riaz Basra, the LeJ quickly distinguished itself as the most violent sectarian  force in Pakistan.  

 LeJ is based primarily in the Punjab and Balochistan regions of Pakistan, and the port city of  Karachi. It is responsible for numerous targeted killings and massacres. The group has  targeted for assassination, not only opposing Shi’a activists, but prominent Shi’a officials,  professionals and businessmen. It has assassinated Iranian nationals in Pakistan and was  involved, along with the JeM, in the abduction and murder of US journalist Daniel Pearl in  January 2002. It has also instigated attacks, including small-arms attacks and suicide  bombings, on Shi’a mosques and processions, and Christian churches resulting in the random  killing of hundreds of people. 

 Members of the LeJ also maintained a presence in Afghanistan until they were forced into the  tribal areas of Pakistan following the fall of the Taliban. 

 Objectives 

 The LeJ’s ultimate objective is the establishment of a truly Islamic - as they would define it -  theocratic state in Pakistan, through the use of violence. Part of a broader Sunni extremist  movement, LeJ’s membership harbour an intense hatred of all foreign, or non-Islamic  influences. The group is also fervently anti-Shia and aim to have them declared a non-Muslim  minority. 

 Leadership and membership 

 Muhammad Ajmal (aka Akram Lahori) is reportedly the present leader of the LeJ. Ajmal  succeeded Riaz Basra following Basra’s death in May, 2002 as a result of a shootout with  Pakistani police. Ajmal is himself in custody following his arrest in June 2002 for his alleged  involvement in 38 cases of sectarian killings. It is not clear if Ajmal continues to head the  group while in detention. 

 14 

 LeJ is estimated to have 300 active members. Pakistani government security crackdowns  since late-2001 have had some success, but the group continues to recruit new members to  replace those arrested or killed in such encounters. Over half of Pakistan’s madrassas  (religious schools) are Deobandi run and they provide a fertile pool of manpower susceptible  to LeJ recruitment. The LeJ maintains a multi-cellular structure, made up of loosely co-ordinated regional sub-units further divided into several small cells that operate independently  of one another.  

 The present status of LeJ training facilities is not known. LeJ training camps in Afghanistan  were destroyed by the United States and their training facilities in Pakistan have been  disrupted by local police. Being part of a broader Deobandi movement, however, the LeJ can  rely on the assistance of other militant Deobandi groups including its parent the SSP, the 

 Jamiat ul-Ansar (JuA - also known as Harakat ul-Mujahideen or HuM), Jaish-e-Mohammad  (JeM), and Harakat ul-Jihad al-Islami (HuJI).  

 The LeJ also receives assistance from the sectarian political organisation Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Islam (JUI). It receives financial support from middle-class urban Sunnis keen to challenge  the influence of the Shi’a landed elite. The LeJ has an extremely close relationship with the  Taliban and confirmed links with al-Qa'ida. Pakistani government investigations confirmed  al-Qa’ida had provided LeJ with training, including the skills necessary for undertaking  suicide bomb attacks. 

 Terrorist activities 

 The LeJ has been involved in a number of terrorist attacks, including targeted assassinations,  small-arms attacks and suicide bombings against, Shia, Christian, Western and government  targets. 

 Recent terrorist attacks for which responsibility has been claimed by, or reliably attributed to  the LeJ, have included:  

 â¢ 4 July 2003: suicide bombing of a mosque in Quetta in which 53 Shi’as were killed; 

 â¢ March 2004:  attack on a Shi’a procession in Quetta which killed 46 people; 

 â¢ 7 May 2004: suicide bombing of the Haderi mosque in Karachi in which 23 Shi’a were  killed;  

 â¢ 3 June 2004: suicide bombing of the Ali Raza Shi’a mosque in Karachi which killed  21 persons;  

 â¢ June 2004: murder of 12 Shi’ite police cadets in Balochistan;  

 â¢ 11 September 2004: murder of a Shi’ite university teacher in Baluchistan; and 

 â¢ 25 December 2004: murder of two Pakistani aid workers during an attack on the office  of the Aga Khan Foundation in Chitral.

 Conclusion 

 ASIO assesses that the LeJ is continuing to prepare, plan and foster the commission of acts  involving threats to human life and serious damage to property.  This assessment is  corroborated by information provided by reliable and credible intelligence sources and  official reporting. 

 In the course of pursuing its objective of overthrowing the Pakistan Government and  replacing it with a theocratic Sunni-Islamic state the LeJ is known to have engaged in actions  that: 

 â¢ are aimed at advancing the LeJ’s political and religious causes; 

 â¢ are intended to, or do, cause serious damage to property, the death of persons or  endangerment of life. 

 â¢ done with the intention of coercing or influencing by intimidation the governments  and people of numerous countries; and 

 â¢ are intended to cause, or have caused, serious risk to the safety of sections of the  public in Pakistan and other persons visiting areas in which it operates.

 ATTACHMENT F 

 Egyptian Islamic Jihad  (Also known as: al-Jihad; Jihad Group; Islamic Jihad; Al-Jihad al-Islami; New Jihad  Group; Qaeda al-Jihad; Talaa’al al-Fateh; Vanguards of Conquest; al-Takfir; World  Justice Group; International Justice Group, Islamic Group) 

 The following information is based on publicly available details about the Egyptian Islamic  Jihad (EIJ). These details have been corroborated by material from intelligence investigations  into the activities of the EIJ and by official reporting.  ASIO assesses that the details set out  below are accurate and reliable. 

 The EIJ has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation in Australia, and by the United Nations  and the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Egypt. 

 Background 

 The EIJ emerged as a coalition of Sunni Islamic radical groups that split from the Muslim  Brotherhood, an Egyptian Islamist political movement, in the late 1970s. The EIJ’s goal was  to replace the secular Egyptian government with an Islamic state.  

 Following the EIJ’s assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981, the Egyptian  government cracked down on the group, severely restricting its capability within Egypt. In  1987 the EIJ leader Ayman al-Zawahiri moved the base of the EIJ’s operations to  Afghanistan.  

 During the 1990s members of the EIJ leadership, including Ayman al Zawahiri, drew close to  al-Qa’ida.  On 23 February 1998 a statement was published declaring the founding of the  International Islamic Front for Jihad on the Jews and Crusaders.  This umbrella organisation  drew together elements of the EIJ, al-Qa’ida and other militant groups.  The statement was  signed by al-Zawahiri as leader of the EIJ.  In line with al-Qa’ida’s publicly stated aims,  elements of the EIJ have increasingly targeted US and Western interests since 1998.  However, many EIJ members resisted this alignment on the basis that they wanted the EIJ to  maintain its primary focus on attacking Egyptian interests.  

 ASIO assesses that the EIJ remains active and continues to exist as a separate organisation  from al-Qa’ida, despite the membership being dispersed and elements of the EIJ being closely  associated with al-Qa’ida. 

 Objectives 

 The  EIJ  aims  to  replace  the  Egyptian  government  with  an  Islamist  state  and  to  attack  US,   Egyptian  and  Israeli  interests  in  Egypt  and  abroad.   Since  entering  into  an  alliance  with  al-Qa’ida  in  1998,  al-Zawahiri’s  followers  have  also  adopted  the  internationalist  goals  of  al-Qa’ida. 

 Leadership and membership 

 The spiritual leader of the EIJ is considered to be Sheikh Umar Abd al-Rahman who was  imprisoned for his involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the murder of an  extremist rabbi and plots to attack other targets in New York.

 As a result of al-Zawahiri’s affiliation with al-Qa’ida, the EIJ now comprises two main  militant factions: one led by al-Zawahiri, which remains closely allied with Usama bin-Laden  and al-Qa’ida; and a larger faction led by Tharwat Salah Shihata, which remains primarily  focused on the EIJ’s original goal of overthrowing the Egyptian Government. There is no  evidence that this has led to the creation of two separate organisations. Both factions share the  same core beliefs and remain in contact. 

 The EIJ originally relied upon the diversion of funds from Muslim charitable causes and  clandestine fundraising by supporters.  Following the closer alignment with al-Qa’ida, the EIJ  relies on the charitable and commercial networks utilised by al-Qa’ida, as well as criminal  activity. 

 The EIJ operates in widely-dispersed small independent cells, with leaders appointed for each  cell.  The overall membership of the EIJ is currently unknown; available information suggests  that in Afghanistan and Pakistan there are approximately 200 core members. The EIJ’s 

 network of members and supporters can be found in Egypt, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Pakistan,  Sudan, Iran, UK and Yemen.  Members have been arrested in Albania, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria,  Romania and the United Arab Emirates. 

 The EIJ has recruited individuals with skills in forgery, military operations and  marksmanship.  Many EIJ members have received training at camps that also provided  training to al-Qa’ida recruits.  EIJ members have received training in terrorist related skills  including the manufacture, use and smuggling of explosives, and assassinations. 

 Terrorist activities 

 Consistent with its primary goals, the EIJ initially conducted armed attacks against high-level  Egyptian government personnel and Egyptian facilities. As the EIJ’s goals became  intertwined with those of al-Qa’ida and the EIJ became frustrated with its inability to  overthrow the Egyptian government, the EIJ concentrated on attacks against Egyptian targets  outside Egypt and US interests.  

 Effective security operations have severely restricted the EIJ’s capabilities within Egypt.   Consequently there have been no recent attacks in Egypt that are attributed to the EIJ.  However, on the basis of available information ASIO assesses that EIJ operatives still exist in  Egypt: in January 2003, the Egyptian Interior Minister stated that a number of ‘sleeper cells’  still exist there. 

 Despite the lull in activities publicly attributed to the EIJ, ASIO assesses that the EIJ, and EIJ  members active in the al-Qa’ida network, continue to prepare, plan for and foster acts of  violence with a view to furthering its objectives. This assessment is supported by reliable  information provided by other intelligence sources. Ayman al-Zawahiri remains a significant  symbol and leader of global jihad and is still considered the leader of the EIJ faction based in  Afghanistan and Pakistan.  He is also widely considered to be second-in-command of al-Qa’ida and spiritual mentor to Usama bin Ladan. On 21 May 2003 and 1 October 2004, al-Zawahiri issued public statements calling for and supporting attacks against Western interests,  including Australia.   

 ASIO assesses that the EIJ will likely resume its campaign against the Egyptian Government  if and when the opportunity arises.  The close relationship between elements of the EIJ 

 18 

 leadership and other groups within the al-Qa’ida network means the EIJ may draw upon  significant material support in relation to its future activities. 

 Major terrorist attacks which have been reliably attributed to the EIJ or for which the EIJ has  claimed responsibility have included: 

 â¢ October 1981: assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat; 

 â¢ August 1993: attempted assassination of Egyptian Interior Minister Al-Alfi; 

 â¢ November 1993 attempted assassination of Egyptian Prime Minister Ated Sedky; 

 â¢ June  1995:  attempted  assassination  of  Egyptian  President  Mubarak  in  Addis  Ababa,   Ethiopia; 

 â¢ November 1995: assassination of an Egyptian diplomat in Geneva; 

 â¢ 19  November  1995:  suicide  truck-bomb  attack  against  the  Egyptian  embassy  in   Pakistan, killing 17 people;  

 As  a  member  of  the  al-Qa’ida  coalition,  the  EIJ  have  been  implicated  in  a  number  of   significant terrorist attacks, including: 

 â¢ 7  August  1998:  bombings  of  the  US  embassies  in  Tanzania  and  Kenya  killing  over   200 people; 

 â¢ 12 October 2000: suicide bomb attack against the USS Cole, Aden, Yemen; and 

 â¢ 11 September 2001: attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon  

 Conclusion 

 ASIO assesses that the EIJ continues to prepare, plan and foster the commission of acts  involving threats to human life and serious damage to property.  These assessments are based  on information provided by reliable and credible intelligence sources. 

 In the course of pursuing its objectives of replacing the Egyptian government with an Islamist  state and attacking US and Israeli interests, Egyptian Islamic Jihad is known to have engaged  in actions that are: 

 â¢ are aimed at advancing the EIJ’s political and religious causes; 

 â¢ done with the intention of coercing or influencing by intimidation the governments and  people of numerous countries (including Australia); 

 â¢ intended to, or do, cause serious damage to property, the death of persons or endanger  life; and 

 19 

 â¢ intended to cause, or have caused, serious risk to the safety of sections of the public in  Egypt and other persons visiting areas in which it operates. 

 In view of the above information, Egyptian Islamic Jihad is assessed to be directly or  indirectly engaged in preparing, planning, and fostering the conduct of terrorist acts.  Such  acts include actions which are to be done and threats of actions which are to be made with the  intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause and with the intention of  coercing, or influencing by intimidation government and people of Egypt, the United States  and other countries.  The actions or threatened actions which Egyptian Islamic Jihad are  assessed to be involved in would, if successfully completed, cause serious physical harm and  death to persons and serious damage to property.
