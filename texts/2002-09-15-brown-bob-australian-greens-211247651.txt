 Annual National Conference Marks the 10th Anniversary of Australian Greens

 Greens address the likely war on Iraq, the Cunningham by-election, Greenhouse and Labor’s policy failure on asylum seekers

 The Australian Greens annual national conference in Brisbane, marking the 10th anniversary of the party, has adopted a set of dynamic polices and electoral plans that will assist the party in the forthcoming national and state elections as well as the federal by-election in Cunningham.

 “In particular discussion of the looming war with Iraq has been high on our agenda. The Greens have determined to oppose such a war and will be active in ensuring a lively community protest movement is mobilised against any possible Australian involvement in a war on Iraq,” Greens Senator Bob Brown said

 “The Greens in the Senate will push again next week for a Senate inquiry into the possible war similar to inquiries already underway in the US.

 “The Greens will also start contingency plans for a possible early double dissolution ‘war’ election which John Howard could call on the back of a US led invasion of Iraq,” Senator Brown said.

 “On the back of this weekend’s record Greens opinion poll of 9% nationally the Greens will be running a strong campaign in Cunningham by-election with local preselection to occur on Monday,” Greens Senator Kerry Nettle said.

 “The Greens conference expressed alarm that the ALP is set to adopt a new refugee policy that would imprison asylum seekers on the excised Christmas Island. This would simply turn the Pacific solution to an Indian Ocean solution effectively reviving a Pauline Hanson proposal.

 “The Greens also undertook to push for a 60% reduction in Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions as well as ratification of the Kyoto protocol as a small step on the path to halting global warming,” Senator Nettle said.

 Annual National Conference Marks the 10th Anniversary of Australian Greens

 Greens address the likely war on Iraq, the Cunningham by-election, Greenhouse action and Labor’s policy failure on asylum seekers

 “The Greens conference expressed alarm that the ALP is set to adopt a new refugee policy that would imprison asylum seekers on the excised Christmas Island.  This would simply turn the Pacific solution to an Indian Ocean solution and is reviving a policy Pauline Hanson proposed before the last election.

 “The Greens also undertook to push for a 60% reduction in Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions as well as ratification of the Kyoto protocol as a small step on this path to halting global warming,” Senator Nettle said.
