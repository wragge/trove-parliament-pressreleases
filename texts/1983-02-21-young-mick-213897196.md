 IMMIGRATION AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS

 The Labor Party in Government will maintain and develop .

 its strong commitment to ethnic communities' development 

 and to the recognition of the significant contribution 

 which is made by them to our society.

 Labor regards it as the Government's responsibility to 

 assist migrants in establishing themselves with the same 

 rights, opportunities and responsibilities as all Australians. 

 Participation of these settlers in Australian society at 

 the level desired by them must be facilitated in every 

 possible way, recognising the important role family reunion 

 plays in this process.

 All ethnic groups must be free to retain and express their 

 ethnic identity if they desire to do so, without sacrificing 

 their rights of equal access to community resources.

 Improved community relations; the relationships of particular 

 ethnic groups, whether English speaking or not, with all 

 sections of the community, must be positively encouraged and 

 any measures taken must be administered with flexibility and 

 an understanding of the ethnic diversity of the population.

 EDUCATION AND NATIONAL LANGUAGE POLICY .

 Labor will increase the number of teachers of English as a 

 Second Language in accordance with local needs, complemented 

 by an increase in grants for teaching materials.

 Labor will extend support for ethnic schools by the provision 

 of per capita grants for children in ethnic schools or multi­

 cultural programs in mainstream educational institutes.  The 

 Commonwealth contribution will be increased from $30 to $45 - 

 an increase of 5 0 ° /o . .

 At adult level we will be providing for adequate on-arrival 

 English tuition. The Adult Migrant Education Service will be 

 upgraded to establish a permanent Service to deal with the 

 needs of the newly arrived as well as the enormous backlog 

 which has been created by the present Government's lack of 

 commitment. Labor will spend $3«68 million annually' on 

 transferring eligible full-time casual teachers to permanent

 A Labor Government will work closely with trade unions and 

 employers to establish industry-based and occupationally 

 relevant English courses for migrant workers.

 ETHNIC WELFARE AND COMMUNITY ORGANISATIONS

 Labor will assist ethnic community organisations,  composed of 

 democratically elected representatives, to act as advocates 

 for ethnic groups and individuals.

 Labor will continue and extend the Grant-in-Aid scheme and 

 distribute grants on a fair and equitable basis. A Labor 

 Government will increase the amount currently spent on 

 Grant-in-Aid by $1.6 million - an increase of 50°/>·

 A Labor Government will continue support for Migrant Resource 

 Centres.  Priority will be given to those Centres serving 

 highly industrialised areas with high concentrations of 

 migrant workers,  especially if these areas are also experiencing 

 extreme unemployment problems.

 INTERPRETER AND TRANSLATING SERVICES

 Labor recognises that as taxpayers and citizens, non-English 

 speaking members of our community have the right to expect 

 that Government services at every level incorporate adequate

 b

 translation arid interpreter facilities. Xn the prevision of 

 these services,  the Commonwealth Government Departments should 

 set an example.  .

 INDUSTRY AND EMPLOYMENT

 People of non-English speaking backgrounds have special 

 problems in employment and industry. These problems must 

 form a major part of the work of a responsive Ministry of 

 Immigration and Community Relations. Labor regards this as 

 a priority area as well as one that relates to immigration 

 intakes* On the one hand,  therefore,  we will take a series 

 of comprehensive measures designed to protect the rights of 

 and opportunities available to migrant workers and,  on the 

 other, make sure that employers do not recruit overseas 

 labour irre sponsibly.  .

 Appropriate mechanisms for the recognition of overseas trade 

 and professional qualifications will be developed to achieve 

 a uniform approach.

 MIGRANT WOMEN -

 A Labor Government will recognise the special needs of migrant 

 women. The areas of priority are:  health, occupational health

 and safety, psychiatric care, discrimination in employment, 

 sexual harra ssment,  and learning English. In developing 

 strategies for dealing with these problems,  close consultation 

 with migrant women's groups will be maintained, and policies 

 will be worked out in cooperation with the Office of the 

 St a I'.us of Women.

 THE AGED

 Labor will create support services for elderly migrants and 

 assist ethnic communities to care for their aged. A Labor 

 Government will not require "assurances of support" for the 

 sponsoring of non-working age relatives by Australian residents

 V  CITIZENSHIP AND DEPORTATION

 The Citizenship Act and the Migration Act are in urgent need 

 of reform. Both contain many anomalies and discrimination on

 .  .  .  A

 the grounds of sex,  ethnic origin and nationality. Labor would 

 see to it that all discrimination would be removed from the 

 Acts as quickly as possible.

 FAMILY REUNION

 A Labor Government does not intend to curtail this program. 

 Within the immigration program, family reunion must have a 

 very high priority.

 REFUGEES

 A Labor Government will continue to accept refugees without 

 discrimination following negotiations with the United Nations 

 High Commission for Refugees. In addition to that, Labor will 

 make a determined effort in the international arena to achieve 

 political settlement for refugees. .

 THE LABOUR MARKET

 Labor does not advocate an "immigration freeze" as a .  

 temporary measure nor abandoning immigration, but will 

 support immigration at a level which is consistent with the 

 national interest and Australia's humanitarian obligations. 

 However, care will be taken that immigration is not used 

 as a substitute for manpower planning and employment policies. 

 Skilled workers already in Australia will be employed before 

 seeking recruitment overseas.
