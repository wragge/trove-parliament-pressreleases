 SPECIAL PROCESSING CENTRE FOR PRC APPLICATIONS

 The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs will open a special centre exclusively to process  applications by People's Republic of china citizens for the  special PRC Temporary Entry Permit (valid to the end of June, 

 1994) which was recently announced by the Government.

 The centre, situated at 162 Goulburn Street, Sydney will open on  August 1, 1990 and will be the ONLY Immigration Department office  in New South wales to process these applications.

 "No other Regional Office will be involved in the processing of  these applications," stressed Mr. Sandy Fox, head of the team  setting up the special centre.

 The Department will be working closely with relevant community  organisations and groups,  particularly the three organisations  listed below which are in receipt of special funding from the  Department to assist PRC citizens. This is in an effort to  streamline processing and ensure maximum information is available  to PRC citizens. Application forms will be available through  these organisations and staff at these organisations have been 

 fully informed about these arrangements.

 "We have also been liaising with other Government departments  such as Social Security, Community Services and Health and the  Commonwealth Employment Service to ensure prc citizens have all  the necessary support," explained Mr. Fox.

 "The centre will be responsible for processing applications for  the whole of New South Wales, estimated to be somewhere between  9,000 and 15,000.  There will be 10 processing booths operating  and while the aim is to work through 500 applications a day, it  will be quite some weeks before that target is reached.

 "We hope that applicants will not rush the centre in the first  few weeks,  or even the first month or two, to allow us time to  settle in," he said.

 Mr. Fox stressed the importance of several points for the fast  and successful processing of the PRC Temporary Entry Permits and  these are:

 .  The centre at 162 Goulburn Street, Sydney will be the ONLY  centre for the processing of PRC Temporary Entry Permits for PRC  citizens who were in Australia on June 20, 1989.

 .  PRC citizens who have lodged applications for other entry  permits or with the DORS Committee may need to reconsider those  applications.

 . The centre will not provide assistance with filling in forma.  The centre is restricted to the processing of applications only.

 .  The Department will be relying on the PRC community to be  sympathetic to the situation and to exercise restraint in  approaching the centre.

 . PRC citizens suffering severe financial hardship will be  requested to apply first so that the necessary documentation for  access to Department of Social Security benefits can be issued.

 "Applicants will need to be patient, to liaise with relevant  community organisations and groups for information and forms, to  ensure that forms are correctly filled in and that the  appropriate documentation is in order.  This will ensure that  applications are processed quickly and people do not spend time  returning to the centre unnecessarily,M said Mr. Fox.
