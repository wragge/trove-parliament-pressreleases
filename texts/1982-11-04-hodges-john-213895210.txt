 ADDRESS BY THE HON J C HODGES, MP

 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 cn.

 AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

 SYDNEY,  4 NOVEMBER 1982

 LET ME:FIRST THANK YOU FOR YOUR INVITATION TO ADDRESS YOU  ON WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND ONE WHICH 

 I THINK HAS BEEN NEGLECTED IN THE PAST IN AUSTRALIA.

 THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THERE IS AN IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN OUR IMMIGRATION AND FOREIGN POLICIES.

 MY MAIN THEME TONIGHT IS THE INTERACTION. BETWEEN AUSTRALIA'S  DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICIES.

 THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT BETWEEN OUR FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC  INTERESTS IN ALL FIELDS,. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE_ IN THE AREA  OF IMMIGRATION. .

 GOVERNMENTS MUST LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF AUSTRALIAN INTERESTS  AND PRODUCE IMMIGRATION POLICIES WHICH HARMONISE CONFLICTING  DOMESTIC AND EXTERNAL INTERESTS. THIS IS NOT ALWAYS EASY AND  CAN INVOLVE SOME VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS.

 BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER I SHOULD DEFINE MY TERMS OF REFERENCE  LEST WE GET CONFUSED OVER TERMINOLOGY. ,  .  I

 I TAKE FOREIGN RELATIONS TO MEAN THE TOTALITY OF AUSTRALIAN  INTERACTIONS WIT H OTHER COUNTRIES AND AUST RAL IAN INTERESTS J N   THE INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT. AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN INTERESTS CAN  INCLUDE SALES OF AUSTRALIAN GOODS AND SERVICES TO OTHER COUNTRIES/  THE DEFENCE OF OUR SHORES FROM EXTERNAL ATTACK/ OUR INTERNATIONAL 

 REPUTATION, AND ANYTHING ELSE WHICH CLEARLY ADVANCES THE W E L F A R E   OF AUSTRALIA IN SOME IDENTIFIABLE WAY, IT COULD BE ARGUED THAT

 â¢ · ·/2

 ALL AUSTRALIAN INTERESTS ARE ULTIMATELY DOMESTIC IN THAT THEY  ARE THINGS WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE WELFARE OF AUSTRALIANS.

 WHILE I CAN ACCEPT THIS AS A PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPT, IT IS  CONVENIENT AS A PRACTICAL MATTER TO TALK ABOUT EXTERNAL INTERESTS  AND DOMESTIC ONES IF ONLY BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS WE  HANDLE THEM.

 THE DEFINITION OF " IMMIGRATION" IS ALSO NOT AS SIMPLE AS IT  MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT. WITHIN MY PORTFOLIO I DEAL WITH:

 .  MIGRANTS SELECTED BECAUSE THEY HAVE SKILLS WE NEED  .  MIGRANTS SELECTED MAINLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE CLOSE  RELATIVES IN AUSTRALIA .  REFUGEES WHO ARE SELECTED BUT WHO WE TAKE ESSENTIALLY 

 FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS .  VISITORS OF ALL KINDS INCLUDING STUDENTS AND TEMPORARY  WORKERS .  THE POST-ARRIVAL PROBLEMS OF SETTLERS OF ALL KINDS  .  THE EJECTION OF UNDESIRABLES AND LAWBREAKERS

 WHILE I WILL. CONCENTRATE TONIGHT ON THE OVERSEAS ASPECTS WHICH  MEANS MOSTLY THE SELECTION OF MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES, I WILL  TOUCH ON OTHER ASPECTS. IN CHOOSING TO CONCENTRATE ON THESE  AREAS, I WOULD NOT WANT YOU TO LOSE SLGJJI, OF THE FACT THAT WE  TAKE MIGRANTS FOR DOMES T IC_ RE AS.QNS.  ’ x '

 IN SHORT, THEY ARE GOOD FOR AUSTRALIA. LVEN IN THE CASE OF 

 REFUGEES - AND I WILL TAKE UP THIS QUESTION IN MORE DETAIL LATER - 

 THERE1  ARE DOMESTIC ADVANTAGES TO US. YOU HAVE ALL SEEN THE  POSTER WHICH SAYS, "EINSTEIN.WAS A REFUGEE". NOW EVEN IF NOT 

 ALL OUR REFUGEES ARE ElNSTEINS,-.THEY HAVE NEVERTHELESS CONTRIBUTED

 /3

 MUCH TO OUR SOCIETY. .  .

 THE DEGREE TO WHICH AN IMMIGRATION POLICY AND A FOREIGN POLICY  INTERACT VARIES FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY. IN A COUNTRY WHICH IS  OVERPOPULATED AND WHICH ONLY ADMITS FOREIGNERS ON A VERY  RESTRICTED BASIS, IMMIGRATION IS NOT USUALLY A VERY IMPORTANT  PART OF ITS DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN POLICIES. GENERALLY SPEAKING  THE IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES ARE THERE TO CONTROL EXIT AND  ENTRY IN A PRETTY MECHANICAL WAY.

 BUT FOR AUSTRALIA WHICH IS A COUNTRY OF IMMIGRATION - MORE  ACCURATELY A COUNTRY OF IMMIGRANTS - THINGS ARE VERY DIFFERENT.

 I RECALL A CARTOON WHICH APPEARED IN ONE OF OUR NEWSPAPERS A YEAR  OR SO AGO ON AUSTRALIA DAY. IT SHOWED A GROUP OF ABORIGINES 

 SITTING ON A ROCK IN SYDNEY HARBOUR WATCHING THE FIRST FLEET  ARRIVING. ONE OF THEM TURNED TO THE OTHER AND SAID:

 "YOU KNOW Î Î  AFRAID THIS IS THE END OF CIVILISATION AS WE 

 KNOW IT."

 SUFFICE IT TO SAY FOR OUR PRESENT PURPOSES THAT HE HAD A POINT.  IMMIGRATION WAS INDEED THE END OF CIVILISATION AS THE ABORIGINES  KNEW IT. TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY, IMMIGRANTS BROUGHT A WHOLE NEW  WAY OF LIFE. IN THE POST WORLD WAR II PERIOD THE AUSTRALIAN 

 SOCIETY WHICH HAD DEVELOPED SINCE THE FIRST IMMIGRANTS ARRIVED  WAS SUBJECTED TO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE WHICH, WHILE NOT AS .  

 TRAUMATIC AS THAT RECEIVED BY THE ORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF OUR  LAND, WAS NEVERTHELESS A PRETTY PROFOUND ONE. THERE CAN BE NOT  THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT THE AUSTRALIA OF 1982 IS NOT THE .   AUSTRALIA OF 1945. THE CHANGES· HAVE BEEN PROFOUND AND TO MY  MIND THEY HAVE BEEN FOR THE MOST PART BENEFICIAL.

 Î ,

 THE DOMESTIC EFFECTS ARE OBVIOUS TO ALL BUT I WOULD LIKE TO  STRESS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN EFFECTS ON OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS  AS WELL. THE INFLUX OF PEOPLE OTHER THAN THOSE FROM THE 

 BRITISH ISLES HAS GIVEN US A NEW PERSPECTIVE. IT HAS CHANGED  OUR WAYS AND OUR CUSTOMS. IT HAS ALSO LET) US TO LOOK IN A MORE 

 OPEN WAY ON COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THOSE FROM WHICH THE ORIGINAL  COLONISTS CAME. IT HAS MEANT THAT OUR VERY CLOSE TIES WITH  BRITAIN AND IRELAND. HAVE BEEN MODIFIED. IT HAS MEANT THAT WE  HAVE QUITE DIRECT TIES WITH A HOST OF NEW COUNTRIES. COMMERCIALLY 

 IT HAS GIVEN US IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTRACT USEFUL  INVESTMENT AND ENTREPRENEURIAL SKILLS AS WELL AS IMPROVING MARKET  OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR EXPORTERS. .

 OF. COURSE THE WORLD AROUND US HAS BEEN CHANGING AND IT IS  EQUALLY TRUE TO SAY THAT THE WORLD OF 1982 IS VERY DIFFERENT 

 FROM THE WORLD OF 1945. WE HAVE A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT  OUTSIDE OUR SHORES AS WELL AS WITHIN OUR SHORES. I DON'T .

 PROPOSE TO GET INVOLVED HERE IN NIT-PICKING ABOUT WHICH HAS  BEEN THE GREATER OR LESSER INFLUENCE BUT I SIMPLY ACCEPT  THAT THE CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF OUR SOCIETY HAVE AFFECTED THE WAY WE LOOK AT THE WORLD/AND THEREFORE OUR

 // ' 

 FOREIGN RELATIONS/AND THAT THE CHANGES IN THE WORLD AROUND  US HAVE ALSO AFFECTED TO SOME EXTENT OUR DOMESTIC VIEWPOINTS  AND OUR EXTERNAL VIEWPOINTS.

 I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE UP NOWy^SOME ASPECTS OF OUR PAST AND PRESENT  MIGRATION POLICIES TO SHOW HOW THEY HAVE AFFECTED^AND BEEN  AFFECTED BY OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS. â

 THE. PAST .

 LET US FIRST LOOK AT THE PAST, 1  DON'T NEED TO GIVE YOU A 

 HISTORY LESSON.-9 NOR DO I WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME BY STATING  THE OBVIOUS". THE PERIOD FROM 1788 TO 1945 WAS ESSENTIALLY -   ONE WHEREBY A GROUP OF IMMIGRANTS FROM THE BRITISH ISLES TOOK  OVER THIS CONTINENT AND DISPLACED THE CULTURE WHICH THEY 

 FOUND HERE. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO GO INTO THE RIGHTS AND 

 WRONGS OF WHAT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A MILITARY OCCUPATION - A CONQUEST  IF YOU LIKE. BUT LET US NOTE THAT ONCE THE ENGLISH COLONISTS  HAD ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES, THE AUSTRALIA WHICH THEY CREATED  LOOKED ESSENTIALLY TO THE "MOTHER COUNTRY'/AND GENERALLY TOOK 

 ITS FOREIGN RELATIONS FROM THE MOTHER COUNTRY.

 HOWEVER, THIS WAS NOT COMPLETELY THE CASE. YOU WILL BE WELL  AWARE OF THE VIEWS OF THE COLONISTS OF THE LAST CENTURY, ABOUT  THEIR IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT. THESE ATTITUDES LED US TO ASSUME  RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAPUA NEW GUINEA; TO ESTABLISH A RESTRICTIVE 

 IMMIGRATION POLICY WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO KEEP OUT OUR IMMEDIATE  NEIGHBOURS WHOM WE FEARED; AND TO TRY TO PRESSURE THE MOTHER  COUNTRY TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF OUR PARTICULAR INTERESTS.

 THIS WAS THE TIME WHEN THE WHITE AUSTRALIA POLICY WAS INTRODUCED.  HERE IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF AN IMMIGRATION POLICY BASED ON  DOMESTIC CONSIDERATIONS WHICH HAD VERY PROFOUND EFFECTS ON OUR  FOREIGN RELATIONS. WE ARE STILL TRYING TO RID OURSELVES OF  THE LEGACY OF THIS POLICY.

 .  .  ./6

 D.

 IN Tilt 1950'S Î‘,Ï bO'S AUSTRALIA HAD A TARNISHED REPUTATION WITH   THE COUNTRIES OF ASIA A,ID AFRICA, WE WERE SEEN AS RACISTS AND   OUR POSITION IN THE WORLD WAS CONSEQUENTLY THREATENED AS   THE INFLUENCE OF THE ANTI-RACISTS GREW. FORTUNATELY, WE   EVOLVED WITH THE TIMES AND BY 1972 THE FINAL TOUCHES WERE PUT   TO THE EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS WHICH HAD GOT RID OF THE WHITE   AUSTRALIA POLICY. WHILE THE MELODY MAY TO SOME EXTENT LINGER   ON, WE ARE HOW AT LEAST IN A POSITION TO PROCLAIM TO THE   WORLD WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE THAT WE OPERATE A NON-DISCRIMINATORY  

 POLICY. NEVERTHELESS DURING THIS POST WAR PERIOD THERE CAN BE .   NO DOUBT THAT OUR IMMIGRATION POLICY HAD AN IMPORTANT EFFECT ON   OUR FOREIGN RELAlIONS.

 hi  THE SAME TIME WE CAN SEE THAT THE ACCEPTANCE OF MIGRANTS  

 GRADUALLY AFFECTED DOMESTIC ATTITUDES. THE INTRODUCTION OF   GARLIC EATING AND FOREIGN SPEAKING EUROPEANS CREATED A FEW s h o c k s  w h i c h  s e r v e d  t o o p e n  t h e  a t t i t u d e s  o f t h e  t r a d i t i o n a l

 AUSTRALIA. ASIAN STUDENTS CAME IN AND THEN ASIAN SETTLERS.   AUSTRALIANS BECAME MORE USED TO PEOPLE OF A DIFFERENT BACKGROUND.

 CUMING TO THE PRESE.fi, WE HAVE BECOME A MULTICULTURAL NATION. OF 15 m AUSTRALIANS, 3m OR 1 IN 5 ARE OVERSEAS BORN. WE ARE   A COUNTRY HADE UP OF PEOPL l FROM MANY DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS   WHO BRING WIN THEM THE ATTITUDES AND OUTLOOKS OF THOSE   BmCGROUNDS.  THEY ALSO BRING WITH THEM A KNOWLEDGE AND AWARENESS   OF OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHICH IS USEFUL TO US. THEY BRING  

 US DIRECT CONTACTS WHICH HELP US NOT ONLY IN A VAGUE POLITICAL   SEuSc BUl ALSO IN A DlRcCl COMMERCIAL SENSE,

 .  .77

 / .

 AGAINST THIS'BACKGROUND, LET US NOW LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING  IN AUSTRALIA TODAY. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A FEW OF THE MORE 

 IMPORTANT CONTEMPORARY ISSUES AND LOOK AT THEM IN MORE DETAIL 

 AS EXAMPLES OF HOW THINGS WORK.

 VISITORS

 WHILE TEMPORARY ENTRANTS ARE NOT STRICTLY IMMIGRANTS, OUR  VISITOR POLICY CAN AFFECT FOREIGN RELATIONS.

 IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT, FOR THE MOST PART, THE ADMISSION OF .  

 VISITORS TO AUSTRALIA, IS BASED ON PURELY DOMESTIC CONCERNS.

 WE LET PEOPLE IN UNLESS WE HAVE GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY  WILL POSE A THREAT TO THE SAFETY OF AUSTRALIANS (E.G. TERRORISTS)  OR THAT THEY CLEARLY INTEND TO CIRCUMVENT OUR MIGRATION RULES  BY STAYING AND WORKING ILLEGALLY IN AUSTRALIA. EVEN IF A FOREIGN  COUNTRY IS OFFENDED BY OUR ADMISSION OF SOMEBODY, I BELIEVE  THAT IN MOST CASES THE PRINCIPLES OF FREEDOM WHICH GOVERN OUR  WAY OF LIFE MUST PREVAIL OVER THE WISHES OF OTHER COUNTRIES  WHICH SUBSCRIBE TO DIFFERENT PRINCIPLES.

 NEVERTHELESS, THERE ARE OCCASIONS WHERE FOREIGN POLICY  CONSIDERATIONS OVERRULE THIS PRACTICE. SOME CURRENT EXAMPLES ARE

 .  RESTRICTIONS ON SOUTH AFRICANS IMPOSED BY OUR ADHERENCE  TO THE GLEN EAGLES AGREEMENT - WE CANNOT BREACH AN  AGREEMENT TO WHICH AUSTRALIA IS A PARTY.

 .  RESTRICTIONS ON SOME CATEGORIES OF SOVIET VISITORS AS A  RESULT OF GOVERNMENT POLICY ARISING OUT OF FOREIGN .

 POLICY CONSIDERATIONS (I,E. AFGHANISTAN AND POLAND). .

 . .  ./8

 .  REFUSAL t o a d m i t  o f f i c i a l  r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s  o f g o v e r n m e n t s OR MOVEMENTS WHICH AUSTRALIA DOES NOT RECOGNISE I.E. .  TAIWAN, FREIELIN,

 REFUGEES

 IN RECENT YEARS, REFUGEES HAVE COME MAINLY FROM INDOCHINA   AND EASTERN EUROPE - ESPECIALLY VIETNAM AND POLAND.  BECAUSE   OF ASIA'S IMPORTANCE TO AUSTRALIA AND BECAUSE OF THE .

 COMPLEXITIES INVOLVED, THE VIETNAMESE BOAT PEOPLE ARE   A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW FOREIGN RELATIONS AND IMMIGRATION   CAN BE. CLOSELY INTERTWINED IN AUSTRALIA. I TURN TO THE   MAJOR FACTORS INVOLVED.

 FIRST, CONSIDER THE FOREIGN RELATIONS ASPECTS. THEY GO FAR   BEYOND OUR RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM. THE BOAT PEOPLE WERE   LANDING IN SOUTH EAST ASIAN COUNTRIES WHICH WERE ALREADY   OVER-POPULATED AND WHICH WERE NOT WILLING OR ABLE TO LET  

 THEM STAY. THESE COUNTRIES, PRIMARILY MALAYSIA AND   INDONESIA, ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO AUSTRALIA IN STRATEGIC, POLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL TERMS - ASEAN'S IMPORTANCE DOES   NOT NEED TO BE SPELT OUT TO AN AUDIENCE LIKE THIS ONE. THE PRESSURES ON AUSTRALIA TO TAKE LARGE NUMBERS OF  

 REFUGEES WERE VERY-STRONG. WE WERE SEEN AS A COUNTRY '

 WITH PLENTY OF ROOM AND RICH ENOUGH TO TAKE THEM. NOT   TO HAVE RESPONDED WOULD HAVE HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT IN A   HOST OF WAYS ON OUR RELATIONS WITH COUNTRIES VERY IMPORTANT   TO AUSTRALIA. THERE WOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN ADVERSE REACTIONS  

 IN COUNTRIES FURTHER AFIELD E.G. NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE. ·

 IT- IS A MATTER OF HISTORY THAT AUSTRALIA DID RESPOND. AND   RESPONDED GENEROUSLY. BUT IT WOULD BE A BIG MISTAKE TO SEE ../9

 "' 4,

 THIS QUESTION PURELY IN FOREIGN POLICY TERMS. THE NUMBERS  INVOLVED HAVE ADDED A MAJOR NEW GROUP TO THE AUSTRALIAN  COMMUNITY. WE HAVE ADMITTED OVER 60,000 VIETNAMESE TO '

 AUSTRALIA SINCE THE FALL OF SAIGO n/aND  VIETNAMESE AREy/THE  THIRD LARGEST GROUP O F PEOPLE ARRIVING EACH YEAR - THAT IS  THEY RANK IMMEDIATELY AFTER UK AND NEW ZEALAND AS A SOURCE  IN OUR ANNUAL INTAKE. THIS HAS MEANT THE CREATION OF  APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE AND OTHER COMMUNITY SERVICES FOR THEM.

 IT HAS ALSO LED TO NEW INFLUENCES DOMESTICALLY.

 NOT TO HAVE TAKEN THESE REFUGEES WOULD NOT ONLY HAVE HAD SERIOUS  EFFECTS ON OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS BUT IT WOULD ALSO HAVE HAD  DOMESTIC CONSEQUENCES. THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT HAD WE  NOT TAKEN OUR SHARE OF REFUGEES THEY WOULD HAVE ;BEEN PUSHED  ON TO DARWIly^AND THE BOATS WOULD HAVE UNLOADED PEOPLE IN AUSTRALIA. 

 INSTEAD OF THE RELATIVELY SMOOTH INTEGRATION THAT HAS BEEN  ACHIEVED, WE WOULD HAVE SEEN A MUCH ROCKIER ONE.

 BUT DOMESTIC CONSEQUENCES IN TURN AFFECT FOREIGN RELATIONS.

 IF, FOR EXAMPLE, THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC WERE TO FEEL WE WERE   TAKING THE WRONG KINDS OF REFUGEES AND IF CONSEQUENT DOMESTIC   OPPOSITION WERE TO BUILD UP TO THE POINT WHERE THE AUSTRALIAN   GOVERNMENT FELT IT HAD TO CEASE TAKING REFUGEES, THEN THE  

 FOREIGN RELATIONS PROBLEMS NEED NO SPELLING OUT. TO AVOID   THIS SITUATION, WHICH WOULD BE DISASTROUS EXTERNALLY, WE   MUST MAINTAIN THE DOMESTIC CREDIBILITY OF THE REFUGEE PROGRAM   WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVE HAD TO TAKE ACTION TO SELECT OUT   NON-GENUINE REFUGEES/ aND THIS IN TURN HAS EXTERNAL IMPLICATIONS. .

 .  ../10

 "ÎÎ".

 THE ACCEPTANCE OF VIETNAMESE MEANS THAT WE GIVE THEM THE  SAME RIGHTS AS OTHER SETTLERS. BECAUSE THE VIETNAMESE  GOVERNMENT WAS NOT WILLING TO ALLOW OUT VIETNAMESE WHO  QUALIFIED FOR MIGRATION TO AUSTRALIA WE HAVE NEGOTIATED AN  AGREEMENT WITH VIETNAM WHICH ALLOWS VIETNAMESE TO SPONSOR  THEIR RELATIVES. THIS OF COURSE, HAS AFFECTED OUR WIDER  CONTACTS WITH VIETNAM. .

 . ·  WE HAVE THE n/a COMPLEX INTERACTION BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND   EXTERNAL INTERESTS. AS.MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC   AFFAIRS I HAVE THE BASIC RESPONSIBILITY FOR REFUGEE POLICY.

 I AM,,HOWEVER, CAREFUL TO LISTEN TO THE VIEWS OF MY COLLEAGUE  THE FOREIGN MINISTER AND TO ENSURE THAT OUR POLICY SERVES THE  TOTALITY OF AUSTRALIAN INTERESTS AND NOT JUST SOME OF THEM.

 NEW ZEALAND

 LET US NOW LOOK AT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT EXAMPLE - THE TRANS  TASMAN TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS.  UNLIKE VIETNAMESE REFUGEES THIS  IS NOT- -SOMETHING" NEW^BUT IT IS_SOMETHING WHICH HAS BEEN  QUESTIONED. .

 UNDER THIS ARRANGEMENT, AUSTRALIANS AND NEW ZEALANDERS CAN  VIRTUALLY COME AND GO AS THEY PLEASE. LOOKED AT FROM THE  AUSTRALIAN POINT OF VIEW, WE CAN SAY THAT NEW ZEALANDERS COME  HERE WITHOUT ANY OF THE SELECTION PROCESSES THAT MIGRANTS AND  REFUGEES MUST UNDERGO. BOTH. SKILLED AND UNSKILLED WORKERS CAN  ENTER AT WILL. FROM A NARROW IMMIGRATION POINT OF VIEW, THERE  CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE UNRESTRICTED ENTRY OF NEW ZEALANDERS  BREACHES OUR UNIVERSAL. POLICY OF NON-DISCRIMINATION AND THAT IT  ADDS UNWANTED PEOPLE TO OUR LABOUR MARKET. 

 m a a a

 Î

 SO WHY DO WE DO 17? THE ANSWER IS THAI 7 HE RE IS A CLOSE AND 

 LONG S7AND1NG RELATIONSHIP HL7WLEN THE 7WO COUNTRIES AND  70 CHANGE THINGS WOULD GENERATE A STRONG DOMESTIC REACTION AND  GENERALLY BE CONTRARY TO AUSTRALIA'S BROADER INTERESTS,

 THE IMMIGRATION INTEREST HAS, IN OTHER WORDS, BEEN ACCORDED 

 A LOWER PRIORITY BY THE GOVERNMENT.

 SO WE CAN SEE SPECIFIC CASES WHERE WE HAVE SACRIFICED FOREIGN   RELATIONS FOR IMMIGRATION REASONS (WHITE AUSTRALIA); IMMIGRATION   POLICIES FOR FOREIGN RELATIONS (NEW ZEALAND); AND WHERE THERE   HAS BEEN A COMPLEX MIXTURE OF THE TWO. WE HAVE ALSO LOOKED   AT THE BROADER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SOURCE COUNTRIES OF  

 AUSTRALIA'S POPULATIO n/aND AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD.

 FINALLY, I  El US LOOK AT RELATIONS WITH ONE PARTICULAR COUNTRY j  AND SEE HOW IMMIGRATION MATTERS FIT INTO THE TOTAL PICTURE.  MALAYSIA IS A GOOD EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT IS A COUNTRY WHICH IS 

 IMPORTANT TO AUSTRALIA IN A NUMBER OF WAYS.

 AS A CLOSE NEIGHBOUR, AN ASEAN MEMBER AND A COMMONWEALTH  NATION THERE ARE OBVIOUS GENERAL TIES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, IT  IS AN IMPORTANT TRADING PARTNER AND COUNTRY WITH WHICH WE  â¢  HAVE DIRECT DEFENCE A RR A N G E M E N T S .

 IT IS NOT FOR ME TO SPELL OUT THE SENSITIVE AND IMPORTANT NATURE 

 OF THESE TIES BUT I THINK WE CAN ALL TAKE THEM AS READ. IN 

 ADDITION, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MATTERS FOR WHICH I AM 

 RESPONSIBLE THAT ARE OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE.

 . .  ./]?

 JT.

 THESE ARE R EF U G E E S ^  PR] VATE STUDENTS^AND MIGRANTS:

 .  I HAVE DISCUSSED THE REFUGEE QUESTION. I AM SURE 

 YOU ALL KNOW THAT MALAYSIA IS WHERE MOST OF THE BOAT 

 PEOPLE ENDED UP AND THE MALAYSIANS FOR THEIR OWN  REASONS WERE NOT PREPARED TO LET THE BOAT PEOPLE SETTLE  IN MALAYSIA. HAD THE MALAYSIANS PUSHED BOATS OFF AND  .  SENT THEM TO DARWIN THE IMPLICATIONS FOR US WOULD HAVE  BEEN VERY SERIOUS. THE WHOLE ISSUE IS ONE WHICH HAS HAD .  .  THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE STRAINS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.

 .  OVER HALF THE OVERSEAS PRIVATE STUDENTS WHO STUDY IN  AUSTRALIA COME FROM MALAYSIA AND MOST OF THESE ARE OF  CHINESE ETHNIC ORIGIN. OUR STUDENT POLICY THEREFORE  TOUCHES ON SENSITIVE DOMESTIC ISSUES IN MALAYSIA AND  CAN HAVE AN EFFECT ON WIDER RELATIONS. OUR VERY ACCEPTANCE  OF OVERSEAS.STUDENTS ALSO HAS IMPORTANT EFFECTS ON OUR 

 FUTURE POLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH THOSE  COUNTRIES. AT THE SAME TIME, STUDENJS INFLUENCE THE .

 AUSTRALIANS WITH WHOM THEY COME IN CONTACT WHILE IN AUSTRALIA.

 DURING THE PRIME MINISTER'S RECENT VISIT TO MALAYSIA, THE MALAYSIAN PRIME MINISTER REFERRED TO AUSTRALIAN   IMMIGRATION POLIC y/aND COMMENTED THAT WE ONLY TOOK   THE SKILLED PEOPLE BUT LEFT THE UNSKILLED IN MALAYSIA.   AUSTRALIA TAKES MIGRANTS ON A NON-PI SC RI MINATORY BASIS   AND WE TAKE THEM FOR PUB .OWN BENEFIT - WE APPLY THE   SAME SELECTION CRITERIA TO ALL COUNTRIES. OUR INTERESTS   WOULD NOT BE SERVED BY THE ADMISSION OF UNSKILLED PEOPLE  

 WHO COULD NOT GET JOBS IN AUSTRALIA. DR MAHATHIR   LATER SAID THAT HIS REMARKS·.ABOUT IMMIGRATION WERE . . ./13

 35

 DIRECTED "MORE TOWARDS MY FELLOW MALAYS!ANS" ' THAN TOWARDS  A  ^ 

 AUSTRALIAN POLICY. NEVERTHELESS, THE FACT THAT DR MAHATHIR  CHOSE TO RAISE THE QUESTION ON THIS OCCASION SHOWS THAT HE 

 SAW .IT AS AN IMPORTANT ONE IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO .

 ;  COUNTRIES. THE FACT THAT MALAYSIA IS A LARGE AND GROWING  SOURCE OF MIGRANTS, INCLUDING SOME WEALTHY ONES, MAY LEAD  TO FURTHER COMMENT IN THE FUTURE. .

 I HAVE JUST TOUCHED ON A FEW ASPECTS OF THE RELATIONSHIP HERE  AND I HAVE NOT GONE INTO ANY DETAIL ABOUT HOW ALL THESE FACTORS  COME TOGETHER. I LEAVE IT TO YOU TO CONSIDER HOW OTHER ASPECTS .  

 OF OUR RELATIONS WITH MALAYSIA COULD BE SERIOUSLY AFFECTED BY  PROBLEMS OVER REFUGEES, STUDENTS OR MIGRANTS. BUT I HOPE I  HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT IMMIGRATION QUESTIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT I PART OF OUR COMPLEX RELATIONS WITH MALAYS I a/aND THAT DOMESTIC   CONSIDERATIONS BOTH IN AUSTRALIA AND MALAYSIA AFFECT FOREIGN   RELATIONS. .

 / WHAT THEN OF THE FUTURE? IMMIGRATION IS, AFTER ALL, ESSENTIALLY  A POLICY FOR THE FUTURE. IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THE RESULTS  OF AN ANOP POLL WHICH CAME OUT LAST YEAR. THIS POLL ASKED 

 RESPONDENTS WHETHER THEY FAVOURED A PURELY ANGLO-CELT1C AUSTRALIA,/  A WHITE BUT OTHERWISE VARIED AUSTRALIA,/OR A MULTIRACIAL AND  MULTICULTURAL AUSTRALIA. IT NOTED THE AGES OF ITS RESPONDENTS  AND GAVE THE RESULTS FOR OUR MIDDLE AGED AND. OLD PEOPLE. THE 

 FIGURES TELL THE STORY OF AUSTRALIA'S RECENT HISTORY. A MAJORITY  OF OLD PEOPLE PREFERRED THE ANGLO-CELTIC ALTERNATIVE. THE MIDDLE  AGED WERE MORE EVENLY DIVIDED BUT THE GREATEST NUMBER WENT ,  

 FOR THE "EUROPEAN"ALTERNATIVE. OVER TWO THIRDS OF THE YOUNG  PEOPLE WANTED A MULTICULTURAL AND MULTIRACIAL SOCIETY. , / m

 m . 1  FIND THIS R^FREjHIJNS_EVIPENCE OF THE TOLERANCE OF O U R  YOUNG·PEOPLE/AND PERHAPS ALSO OF THEIR AWARENESS OF WHERE  THE FUTURE LIES. FOR AUSTRALIA TO RETREAT BEHIND A WALL  OF ITS OWN MAKING WOULD BE AN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DISASTER  FOR US BOTH EXTERNALLY AND INTERNALLY. WE CANNOT,/ a s KING CANUTE   D E M O N S T R A T E D H O L D  BACK THE TIDES OF CHANGE. A COUNTRY WHICH  

 LEARNS FROM THE PAST IS A SENSIBLE ONE. A COUNTRY, WHICH TRIES   TO RECREATE THE PAST IN A CHANGING WORLD, MERELY DOOMS ITSELF   TO GO THE WAY OF THE DINOSAURS.

 TO THIS END OUR FOREIGN POLICY MUST BE BASED ON OUR DOMESTIC  NEEDS'- OR WHAT IS BEST FOR AUSTRALIA - AND THIS INCLUDES  SUPPORT OF OUR IMMIGRATION POLICY. AUS1 RAI.IA'S RLPKLSLNlÎ‘ Îª 1VLS  ABROAD MUST UNDERSTAND AND PROJECT THIS NEW AND'CHANGING  AUSTRALIA THAT THEY REPRESENT. THEY MUST LEARN TO USE THE 

 RESOURCES OF A MULTICULTURAL NATION TO BETTER PURSUE AUSTRALIAN  INTERESTS OVERSEAS. THEY MUST TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE  POLITICAL TIES AND COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES WHICH MIGRATION  CREATES.

 IN A RAPIDLY SHRINKING WORLD, ISOLATION MEANS STAGNATION.   IMMIGRATION KEEPS US ON OUR TOES AND BRINGS US CLOSER TO THE  WORLD. WHATEVER IDEALS WE MAY CHERISH FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR  PLANET, IT WILL BE SOME TIME BEFORE THE NATION STATE DISAPPEARS J   AND THIS MEANS WE NEED TO LOOK AT IMMIGRATION LEVELS FIRST AND 

 FOREMOST IN TERMS OF ITS DOMESTIC IMPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, I  HOPE IT IS CLEAR FROM MY TALK TONIGHT THAT I BELIEVE THE 

 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMMIGRATION AND FOREIGN POLICY IS A CLOSE  ÎNE^WHICH REQUIRES CLOSE CO-OPERATION AND SENSITIVE HANDLING  BY THOSE INVOLVED IN BOTH AREAS. I HOPE IT IS ALSO CLEAR THAT 

 t

 .  .,/15

 I SEE A CLOSE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE TW g/aND THAT. I BELIEVE   THAT THE KIND OF IMMIGRATION POLICY WE FOLLOW SERVES AUSTRALIA'S.   INTERNAL INTERESTS/AND ITS FOREIGN RELATIONS. ~ ~  -
