  Ml:'DIA RELEASR SENATORJANC:"r POWCLl I FArJFR OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS  PARLIAMENT OF AUSTF"~ALIA â¢ THE SENATE  P.R. NO. 91/417  30 September, 1991 

  HOWARD. GRBTNER AND H~~ws~d:RE wnoN& o~ IMMIGRATION AND  MULTIOULTU SM - Dfi~ CR TS 

  Senator Jane(, Powell, Democrat Spokesperson on Immigration and Multicultural  Affairs, has slammed recent statements by Messrs. Hewson, Greiner and Howard,  on the issues of immjgration and multiculturalism. 

  11 The Liberals will never get it right as long as their policies continue to be tied to  the outmoded jobs-fodder mentality still supported by the current Labor  Government", Senator Powell said in Melbourne today. 

  uor Hewson 1s suggestion that there should be a reduction in the number of  people migrating in the Family Reunion category, while numbers in the skills  category are rotaincd 1 is irrational and inhumane", Senator Powell said. 

  '"rhis way of thinking has no place in a country with a burgeoning unemployment  problem and a Government committed through Ncwstart to retraining for  employability. It is not appropriate to solicit overseas for people with skills to  enter Australia, with over one million Australians unemployed", Senator Powell  said. 

  "Mr Greiner is quite right when he states that we must retain our humanitarian  obligations to family members of permanent residents in Australia, whatever the  economic climate", Senator Powell said. 

  "However, Mr Greiner's reported rejection of any reduction or general rethink of  immigration numbers, is no(, in line with current needs in Australia or with long­ term goals for a sustainable population level", Senator Powell cont,inued. 

  "The Australian Democrats view migrants first and foremost as people, not as  convenient numbers to fulfil the dreams of economic rationalists11, Senator Powell  said. · 

  11 John Howard's confusion over the real meaning of multiculturalism for all  Australians has added somo unnecessary fuel to the debate, yet again. Will he  never learn!" Senator Powell said. 

  Australian Democrat policy gives prioriLy to the humanitarian aspects of  immigration, that is, to the categories of Farni1y Reunion, Refugees and Special  Humanitarian'', Senator Powell said. 

  "These are the people who have a true commitment to Australia and who really  want to live here, not those who are solicited to migrate to Australia on the  exploitative jobs-fodder basis", Senator Powell concluded.
