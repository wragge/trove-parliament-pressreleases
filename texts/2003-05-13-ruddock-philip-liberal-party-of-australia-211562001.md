 Philip Ruddock MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS

 MEDIA CENTRE

 Immigration at a glance

 MPS 31/2003

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today announced the following key initiatives in the 2003-04 Budget:

 â     A saving of $467 million over four years due to the success of off-shore processing, including:

 â     a saving of $437 million over four years due to the reduction in the estimated number of illegal arrivals from 4500 to 1000 a year,

 â     the number of people in offshore immigration facilities is down from 1500 a year ago to about 450 people, and

 â     a saving of $30.7 million over four years as a result of rationalisation of onshore processing due to the opening of the Baxter 

 facility, and closure of Woomera IRPC.

 â     $10 million over four years allocated for the development of a new profiling system to generate automatic alerts on visa applications from 

 people with profiles of concern.

 â     These may include people potentially associated with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorist activities, and 

 other criminal or fraudulent activities.

 â     This will deliver a more reliable system of alerts, rather than current arrangements that rely on manual alerts.

 â     An additional $7.6 million allocated to DIMIA initiatives that will support the major package of measures announced tonight by the 

 Minister for Education, Science and Training to strengthen Australia's position as a significant provider of international education,  including in new and emerging markets.

 â     Savings of $89.1 million over the next four years as a result of the introduction of a two-stage business skills visa from 1 March 2003. 

 â     Under the new arrangements, most applicants for the business skills visa are first granted a temporary resident visa, which does not 

 give them access to the full range of Government programs until they successfully establish a business and thereby obtain  permanent residence.

 â     Reforms to the Assurance of Support scheme are designed to improve its integrity and to strengthen and simplify its administration.

 â     Some processing currently undertaken by DIMIA will be undertaken by Centrelink whilst significant savings will be achieved in 

 the Family, and

 â     Community Services portfolio as a result of reduced income support claims from sponsored migrants and improved recovery of 

 social security debts accruing under the Assurance of Support scheme.
