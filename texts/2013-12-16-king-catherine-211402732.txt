 MEDIA RELEASE   

 ABOLITION OF EXPERT ADVISORY GROUP ON HEALTH IN DETENTION  FACILITIES   

 

 The Abbott Government is once again proving it is not the government it  promised to be before the election.    

 The decision to abolish the Immigration Health Advisory Group is astounding  given Amnesty’s report regarding the detention centre on Manus Island.    

 “We know that getting the standards right in detention facilities is a difficult job,”  Shadow Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Richard Marles said.   

 “The Government should be relying on the best possible information from a  range of sources.    

 “Clearly this is not something the Abbott government is interested in.”    

 The Immigration Health Advisory Group was an independent body that provided  advice to government about health standards in detention facilities.    

 It consisted of experts with extensive experience working with people in  detention facilities including psychiatrists, psychologists with considerable  experience working with refugees and general practitioners.    

 Today’s decision is consistent with the Abbott government’s decision to abolish  the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council - a body that had been providing advice to  governments since Menzies was Prime Minister, and the sacking by press release  of other expert advisory committees in the health portfolio.   

 “This government simply isn’t interested in the advice of experts,” Shadow  Minister for Health Catherine King said.   

 “The truth is Tony Abbott hasn’t seen an expert he hasn’t wanted to fire.”
