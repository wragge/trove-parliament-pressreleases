 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/401 WEDNESDAY 19 MAY 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS  Democrats call on PM to give generously to Iraqis The Australian Democrats say a speech by the Prime Minister tonight outlining Australia's future commitment to Iraq must cover more than the presence of Australian troops. Democrats Leader Senator Andrew Bartlett said while the debate over the presence of Australian troops in Iraq is important, the bigger question is what other assistance Australia offers to help the people of Iraq. "Economic assistance, building infrastructure and encouraging an urgent transition from US to UN control over a multinational peacekeeping force, are all more important than whether or not there are a few hundred diggers on Iraq soil," Senate Bartlett said. Senator Bartlett also repeated calls for the Government to show compassion to Iraqi asylum seekers on Nauru and temporary protection visa holders in Australia. "It will take a long time to get Iraq on a stable footing and Australia now has a responsibility to help ordinary Iraqi people, both in Iraq and the ones who escaped here before the war. "The Democrats have been consistent in saying that Australia should not have supported or been involved in the invasion of Iraq, but now that Mr Howard involved Australia in causing the damage, we have a moral and legal obligation to help rebuild the country. "It is clearly in the interests of the Iraqi people for the occupying forces to hand over responsibility to an Iraqi administration as soon as possible and to ensure the United Nations has overall command of any foreign troop missions on the ground, not the United States or any of the other invading countries. "The United Nations may well ask Australia to contribute troops to an ongoing peacekeeping force in Iraq.  If they do, we have an obligation to consider providing those troops especially given we have strong record of performing well in peacekeeping roles in many parts of the globe. "However, the debate over troop deployment should not obscure examination of the bigger question, which is what else Australia can do to help repair the damage it has helped to create."
