 ‘IMMIGRATION, BORDER PROTECTION AND POPULATION  FUNDAMENTALS’ 

 Few issues are more revealing of the performance of the Rudd Government than its  failures on border protection. Between 2002 and 2007, there were on average just  three unauthorised boat arrivals a year. So far this year, there have been three a  week. In parliament six weeks ago, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd declared that “when it  comes to the arrival of (boat) people”, John Howard had the gold medal. In fact, the  current financial year has now seen the highest ever number of boat people arrivals  and there’s still almost two months yet to run. As well, Howard largely inherited a  problem and eventually crafted a solution. By contrast, Rudd inherited a solution and  recreated the problem because he couldn’t leave well enough alone. 

 The 117 boats and 5375 boat people who have arrived since the Rudd Government  announced that it was adopting a more “compassionate” policy in July 2008 have  cost more than $400 million to process and engaged very considerable naval and  customs resources in detection and interception. People smugglers are again active,  there’s a new smuggling route from Sri Lanka, and Australia’s relations with  Indonesia are under otherwise unnecessary strain. The Prime Minister’s declared  pre-election readiness to turn boats around has never been demonstrated while his  commitment to offshore processing has given way to reopening the Curtin detention  centre in Western Australia. His commitment to speedy processing has been  replaced by three and six month moratoriums on processing boat people from Sri  Lanka and Afghanistan but that hasn’t stopped the boats and even the Foreign  Minister admits that he doesn’t think that it will. The increasing flow of boats has  strained our capacity to deal with illegal migrants, disrupted our capacity to handle  refugees who aren’t “jumping the queue” and, perhaps most seriously of all, helped  to undermine the public’s confidence in the legitimacy of Australia’s wider  immigration programme. 

 Any perception that the Government has outsourced even a component of migrant  selection to people smugglers threatens Australians’ sometimes fragile support for  immigration. Government should never lightly put this at risk because, with 40 per  cent of the population migrants or migrants’ children, the migrant experience is  central to so many Australians’ sense of self. The danger, whenever the immigration  programme comes into serious question, is that millions of Australians feel less  secure in their own country.  

 It bears repeating that, except for some Aboriginal people, every other Australian is  an immigrant or the descendant of immigrants since 1788. To an extent greater than  almost any other country, we are a nation of relatively recent immigrants.  Immigration has been at the heart of the Australian story because, without it, the  country we now know could not have come into existence.  

 Immigration’s importance does not mean, though, that there is a settled national  orthodoxy about it. Some people think that it would be verging on the reprehensible  not to give to foreigners the opportunity that they or their forbears had to immigrate  to Australia. On the other hand, there are plenty of Australians who think that  immigrants are putting at risk their economic prospects, relaxed lifestyles or cultural  cohesion.  

 As the ANU’s Katherine Betts has noted, except between 1998 and 2004 in the  Howard years, polls have consistently shown that far more people think that  Australia is taking too many migrants; rather than taking too few. From 1972 until  1996, upwards of 50 per cent thought that immigration numbers were too high  compared to about 10 per cent who thought that they were too low. Similarly, a 

 Morgan Poll in March this year found 39 per cent agreement to the proposition that  immigration “should be reduced”. Only 12 per cent wanted it increased.  

 The only extended period when more Australians have been happy about  immigration numbers than not was the time of the Howard Government. For most of  the Howard era, Betts has noted, the percentage thinking that immigration numbers 

 were about right rose from about one third to about two thirds. The former  Government boosted the skills component of the overall immigration programme  from about 30 per cent to more than 60 per cent, extended the waiting period before  new migrants could claim welfare, put more emphasis on Australians’ unity than their  diversity and, above all, largely stopped unauthorised arrivals by boat. Betts  speculates that opposition to immigration declined during the Howard era because  many people believed “that the major problems with immigration (had) been fixed”.  

 It’s worth noting that Australians felt more relaxed and comfortable about immigration  despite the former Government’s substantial increase in the intake from under  100,000 to over 200,000 a year. By contrast, the return of significant discontent 

 about the immigration programme has intensified with the Rudd Government’s  further expansion of immigrant numbers to over 300,000 a year, relative reduction in  the skilled proportion of the intake and, perhaps most significantly, loss of control  over unauthorised boat arrivals. Sixty four per cent of the Morgan poll’s March 

 respondents said that asylum seekers arriving by boat “should be returned and apply  through normal refugee channels”. 

 Late in his term as prime minister, at a time of serious concern about a version of  multiculturalism which stressed how third rate Australia was before its post war  diversity, Bob Hawke confessed that high immigration rates had been a kind of  bipartisan conspiracy of the elites against the general public. This was the era when  immigration policy was driven, in former finance minister Peter Walsh’s words, by 

 “cave-ins to the ethnic lobby”. However misguided popular attitudes might seem, no  policy can endure without at least a measure of public support. Rebuilding majority  support for Australia’s immigration programme was one of John Howard’s important 

 but undervalued achievements. By robustly insisting that Australians had little to be  apologetic about, Howard may have helped us to be more often our best selves  towards newcomers.  

 Australia has always been fairer, more diverse and more easy-going about  difference than the “black armband” view of our history has allowed. The First Fleet  contained a smattering of many nationalities as well as large percentages of Scots  and Irish. Whites were hanged for murdering blacks after the Myall Creek massacre  of the 1830s. The gold rushes brought an influx of Americans as well as Chinese, not  all of whom returned to their homeland. A generation before World War Two,  Australia had significant Italian and Greek communities. Then there was the post-war  influx, first of Eastern Europeans, then from the Mediterranean, and later from Asia.  

 As the historian Ed Campion describes Australia: the English made the laws, the  Scots made the money and the Irish made the songs. It was an overstatement, of  course, like Cardinal Moran’s claim that it was in Australia that the Irish first knew  justice under the Crown but it contains a core of truth. Australia happens to be the  only country in the world (apart from Israel) where Jews have held the positions of  army commander, chief justice and head of state. These days it’s of only passing  interest when a premier is the son of Italian immigrants; a governor is of Lebanese  descent; or a minister identifies as Aboriginal. It just confirms for us that people’s  contributions are not determined by their ethnic backgrounds.  

 For all the misguided and sometimes cruel treatment of Aborigines, the ethnic  typecasting and occasional snobbery which still exists, Australia has rarely seen  domestic discrimination based on race or culture. Conversely, despite Chinatowns  and Little Italies in our big cities, based more on economic opportunity than  conscious desire to stay aloof, Australia has largely avoided the ethnic and cultural  enclaves that now exist in many of the countries of Europe.  

 Australians have often been ambivalent about immigration policy but have rarely  been hostile to migrants, perhaps because they have mostly sensed that each  migrant has made a conscious, personal commitment to Australia. Migrants have 

 voted with their feet for Australia in a way that the native born have never had to.  The welcome customarily extended to migrants has been amply reciprocated.  Successive waves of migrants have quickly adapted to their new country and, at  least by the second generation, mostly thought of themselves as Australians.  

 Immigration to Australia has been a success almost unparalleled in history. It does  seem to become a matter of public concern, though, when there is a significant  change in the composition of the intake, when fears are growing about newcomers’  potential to take Australians’ jobs, or when official policy seems more concerned for 

 migrants’ welfare than for the best interests of the existing Australian population. As  our habitual generosity to the victims of overseas disasters suggests, Australians  understand that charity might begin at home but certainly doesn’t end there. On the  other hand, Australians also seem to think that the Australian Government’s first duty  is to its own citizens. Government ought to look after the interests of others but only  after it’s reasonably accommodated the interests of the people who elect it. 

 The recent Morgan poll showed 87 per cent support for skilled immigration, 78 per  cent support for family reunion immigration, 55 per cent support for Muslim  immigration and just 50 per cent support for asylum seeker immigration (and only  then, it seems, if they’re not queue jumping). Three factors seem to be at work  fuelling contemporary disquiet about immigration. First, the recent spate of  unauthorised boat arrivals has raised fears that Australia’s borders are again  uncontrolled. Second, some recent immigrants seem resistant to Australian notions 

 of equality and an open democratic society. And third, there is concern about  whether the natural and built environment can cope with the population pressures  that immigration contributes to. There is, I suspect, an anxiety that the great prize of  Australian citizenship is insufficiently appreciated and given away too lightly.  

 Australia’s number of unauthorised arrivals may be smaller than that of the United  States, where would-be immigrants merely have to swim the Rio Grande; or of  Europe where would-be immigrants only have to cross the Mediterranean or move to  the more attractive parts of an increasingly borderless continent, but that doesn’t  mean that it’s not a serious problem. For starters, each unauthorised arrival at  Christmas Island costs more than $80,000 to process. In a world where crime and  terrorism are international in scope and where every developed country’s social  security system is under pressure, a policy of benign unconcern about new arrivals  would defy common sense.  

 The problem with simply accommodating boat arrivals is not yet the numbers that  such a policy would add to the immigration programme (although these self-selected  migrants are certainly reducing the numbers of refugees that Australian officials can  select in overseas camps). There is an important principle at stake here. John  Howard’s declaration about Australians controlling who comes to this country  resonated because it struck most people as self-evidently and robustly true. As well,  we can’t be confident that the numbers would stay at the few thousand a year who  have arrived since the Rudd Government junked most of its predecessor’s tough-but-effective border protection policies.  

 If global conditions worsened, millions might at least be tempted to swap their  current existence for the opportunities of a new life in Australia if they thought that  the perils of the boat trip would win them permanent residency. Christmas Island isn’t  much further from Indonesia than Italy’s southern most islands are from Libya and in  2008 35,000 asylum seekers arrived in Italy mainly via that route.  

 Since the beginning of the latest wave of boat people, dozens are known to have  perished at sea, one large boat has disappeared after leaving Indonesia and several  boats are rumoured to have vanished en route from Sri Lanka. The Global Hawk  early warning aircraft that the Coalition has committed to obtain would make it easier  to detect, intercept and help boats at risk. Still, most of those who have taken to the 

 sea have arrived in Australia and have subsequently qualified, under the Rudd  Government’s rules, for permanent residency.  

 The only way to reduce and eventually to stop the boats is to deny their passengers  the goal they seek which is permanent residency in Australia. The Coalition will  shortly announce its detailed border protection policy but it’s worth reiterating key  elements. First and foremost, there has to be a temporary visa for illegal boat arrivals  who are found to be refugees. As well, offshore processing must be retained (even if  this means extending the capacity of Christmas Island). Australia needs to cultivate  the closest possible cooperation with source and host countries, especially  Indonesia, to ensure that as many as possible would-be migrant boats are stopped  before departure and that their passengers can swiftly be returned in ways  consistent with the international convention on refugees. Finally, Australia must  retain the last-resort option to turn around boats with no right to be in Australian  waters where this can be done safely.  

 In the aftermath of the Tampa incident, temporary visas, offshore processing,  heightened cooperation with Indonesia and turning boats around all-but-stopped  further arrivals. After the Tampa’s passengers were disembarked, detained and  processed in Nauru, people smugglers and their customers “got the message” and  boat arrivals virtually ceased. From opposition, it’s impossible to specify how a future  Coalition government might work with the Indonesians and with other neighbours to  stop people smuggling but there’s every reason to think that what happened before  can happen again and that what was stopped before can be stopped again.  

 Australia’s obligation to people seeking sanctuary or to those who have been found  to be refugees has to be balanced against our obligation not to become a soft touch  for anyone who wants a better life. The alternative to mandatory detention is the risk 

 that people might disappear into the community. The alternative to strict border  protection is tacit encouragement for people to risk their lives at sea. Giving boat  people what they want is not self-evidently morally preferable to strict deterrence if it  encourages more of them to take great risks making ocean voyages in leaky boats.  

 It’s this element of danger which creates the distinction between boat arrivals, on the  one hand, and, on the other, people who arrive without putting themselves in peril,  on a visa and with clear identity documents, and only subsequently become  unauthorised over-stayers.  

 A strong border protection policy is perfectly consistent with a large and inclusive  immigration programme. In fact, it’s probably essential if the public is to be convinced  that Australia’s immigration policy is run by the Government rather than by people  smugglers. It’s not surprising that the 70 per cent of Australians who thought that the  immigration intake was too high in 1993 had dropped to just 31 per cent by 2004  even though the intake had increased. More people thought that the immigration  programme was being run firmly in Australia’s national interest. The Labor Party  might not have liked the former Government’s changes but it did not oppose them  perhaps because it understood that perceptions of an open door policy were  undermining Australians’ openness to immigrants. 

 Anxieties about immigration numbers started to increase again in the Howard  Government’s final term. By 2007, 40 per cent thought that they were too high.  Driven by boom-induced skills shortages immigration numbers had risen to what 

 were then record levels and were helping to drive up housing prices. More recently, it  seems, concerns about whether high levels of migration may be compromising  environmental sustainability have compounded Australians’ recurrent concerns  about migrants driving wages down and prices up and (largely misplaced) worries 

 about how migrants might assimilate.  

 In 2007, the second Intergenerational Report forecast a population of 29 million in  2050 based on annual immigration of 140,000 which was a little above the annual  average under the Howard Government. This is a figure that excited no controversy  at the time and is a population target that the Coalition could support. Last October, 

 in the wake of the third Intergenerational Report’s population forecast of 36 million by  2050, Prime Minister Rudd declared: “I actually believe in a big Australia. I make no  apology for that”. A series of polls suggested that most Australians disagreed. A  Nielsen poll in November last year, for instance, showed that 40 per cent thought  that 35 million was too high, 30 per cent thought it was about right and 26 per cent  had no opinion. A Lowy Institute poll showed 69 per cent opposition to 36 million.  

 As it turned out, Mr Rudd’s public support for a big Australia did not last nearly as  long as his position that climate change was the greatest moral challenge of our  time. A “big Australia” has joined an emissions trading scheme as something the  Prime Minister wants but won’t publicly talk about prior to an election. Still he’s  triggered an important debate about population that shouldn’t be stifled in the way  that concerns about immigration policy sometimes have been. Population growth has  such ramifications for so many other policies (such as whether it’s realistic to meet  massive emission reduction targets or how public hospitals funding might be  maintained) that debate should not be shut down even though some people fear that  it might be code for hostility to immigration.  

 It’s not surprising that people worry about immigration when our cities seem to be  bursting at the seams and when existing and planned infrastructure can hardly cope  with the present population let alone the additional 14 million (with two thirds of the  increase due to immigration) that the Prime Minister expects by 2050. The “big  Australia” of 36 million people that Mr Rudd so emphatically welcomed would be the  result of net overseas migration of just 180,000 a year. Under the current  Government’s policies, though, migration is actually running at more than 300,000 a  year. If continued, immigration on this scale would produce a population of 42 million  by 2050 and a population of 32 million within just 20 years.  

 There is no evidence whatsoever that Australian governments are providing, every  year, new infrastructure on the scale of the city of Canberra.  PricewaterhouseCoopers has estimated that sustaining just 36 million people by  2050 would require three new public schools and 160 kilometres of new road to be  built every fortnight for the next 40 years. After the disastrous home insulation  programme and the hugely inflated costs of the school hall programme, there’s  justified skepticism about the Rudd Government’s ability to provide economic 

 infrastructure at a fair price. State Labor governments, too, have been much better at  talking about much needed infrastructure projects than actually delivering them. In 

 the past 15 years, for instance, the NSW Government has announced $28 billion  worth of rail projects that have never gone ahead.  

 Of course, a 60 per cent plus increase in the populations of Sydney and Melbourne  over the next 40 years is not so much more than the increase they’ve managed over  the past four decades. One difference, though, is today’s comparative absence of  reform-minded government at state and Commonwealth level. Recent state 

 governments have invested the proceeds of good economic times in larger  bureaucracies rather than better infrastructure. 

 In the past, Australia has sustained a higher population at higher standards of living  because governments at all levels have been conscious of the need for wealth  creation as well as for redistribution. The Rudd Government, by contrast, is the first  national government in a quarter century to have completed its first term without any  serious wealth creating reform. Instead, it’s rolled back most of the Howard  Government’s workplace reforms and those of the Keating Government too. It’s  turned $60 billion in Commonwealth assets into a $150 billion debt, and now wants  to hit the one industry that kept Australia growing through the Global Financial Crisis  with a further great big new tax on top of the ETS that is still the Government post-election policy. It’s hardly a confidence inspiring record against which to judge the  Government’s ability to plan and build for a much larger population.  

 Australia’s population is a function of the birth rate and the immigration rate.  Governments shouldn’t make judgments about the choices that Australian families  make and have limited influence on them. Governments’ capacity to determine  population rests on the decisions that have to be made every year about the size  and composition of the migrant intake. These normally rest on a judgment about the  strength of Australia’s economy and the readiness of potential migrants to make a  commitment to Australia. Our optimal population is the one determined by all these  choices. Extrapolating current trends can certainly provide a population forecast but  it can’t responsibly provide a population target as the population more than a few  years hence depends on decisions that haven’t yet been made and shouldn’t be  preempted. Current trends need to taken seriously, not as unalterable facts, but as  guides to what might be changed in order to obtain the best long-term outcome for  Australia.  

 Much of this population increase that’s occurred under the Rudd Government is due  to educational courses that have become a backdoor way to obtain permanent  residency. The Government’s recent changes are likely to curtail the numbers of  students seeking a migration outcome. As well, some of the increase is due to  employers’ continued demand for skilled labour. Even so, the Government should  give a clear explanation of why it thinks that it’s in our interests for population  numbers to soar well within most Australians’ lifetimes. A “big Australia” is not  necessarily the same as a stronger and more prosperous Australia. A large migrant  intake would not be in Australia’s interests if our schools and hospitals are bursting,  there is a severe housing shortage and our big cities are choking on their own traffic.  

 Overall immigration numbers should not be fixed at any particular annual figure  throughout the next four decades. Decisions about immigration numbers periodically  need to be reconsidered to take into account updated and transparent expert advice 

 about the projected future population and whether planned infrastructure is likely to  be able to cope. Although skilled migrants undoubtedly contribute to economic  growth, it hardly makes sense to maintain a large immigration programme without  also putting into place the infrastructure needed to accommodate them.  

 Within three months of taking office, a Coalition government would re-constitute the  Productivity Commission as the Productivity and Sustainability Commission and task  it with an annual independent review of Australia’s infrastructure needs for short,  medium and long term projected population numbers. Under a Coalition government,  decisions about the annual migration intake would be informed by this work. Unless  the Productivity and Sustainability Commission was reasonably satisfied that future  infrastructure bottlenecks were being addressed, a Coalition government could be  expected to limit the overall immigration intake.  

 Involving the Productivity Commission should help to re-establish a strong rationale  for Australia’s immigration intake. At any particular time it ought to be clear, as a  result of the Commission’s work, that the size and composition of the programme is  meeting economic objectives and not compromising the livability of our cities. Public  debate should turn less on impressions about the types of migrants who best “fit in”  and more on hard evidence about the economic contribution they can make. Quite  apart from helping to ensure that Australia’s development is sustainable, this should  help to sustain public support for a significant immigration programme. 

 The Coalition gratefully acknowledges the role of immigration in Australia’s economic  and cultural development and salutes the individual contributions that millions of  migrants have made to our country’s success. A strong border protection policy and  a stronger public rationale for immigration should ensure that this continues to be the  case with the least possible doubt about whether it still serves the national interest.  The capacity to make the difficult decisions that this may require would be one of the  key tests of an effective government.
