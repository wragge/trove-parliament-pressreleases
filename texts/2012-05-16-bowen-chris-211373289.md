 ANOTHER BOAT DUE TO ‘DO NOTHING’ ABBOTT   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said the latest asylum seeker boat intercepted today is the 33rd  since Tony Abbott and the Opposition rejected the Government’s offer to work together  to implement offshore processing.   

 “Unless we have a genuine deterrent such as the Malaysia Arrangement in place, we will  continue to see boats arrive on our shores,” Mr Bowen said.    

 “Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison can keep complaining about boat arrivals and put their  own political interest ahead of the national interest, or they can act to prevent these  dangerous boat journeys.   

 “Tony Abbott needs to do the right thing and allow the government of the day to  implement its border protection policies, just as Kim Beazley did with John Howard more  than 10 years ago.”   

 Mr Clare said it was time for the Coalition to vote for offshore processing.   

 “Working together we can help stop people dying at sea. We can pass legislation to  introduce offshore processing,” Mr Clare said.   

 “If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must stop saying no and pass our  legislation to allow asylum seekers to be processed offshore in Malaysia and Nauru.”
