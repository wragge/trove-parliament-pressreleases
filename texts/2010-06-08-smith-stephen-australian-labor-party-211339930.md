 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  STEPHEN SMITH, MP 

 

 Transcript: Joint Press Conference with Mr Bruno Rodriguez, Cuban  Foreign Minister   

 8 June, 2010   

 Perth   

 TOPICS: Australia-Cuba relations, medical cooperation, human rights,  Afghanistan, Australian woman in Yemen, asylum seekers, Australian  election 

 

 STEPHEN SMITH:  Thank  you  very  much  for  attending.  Can  I,  again,  officially  welcome   Cuba's  Foreign  Minister,  Bruno  Rodriguez,  to  Australia,  to  Western  Australia  and  to  Perth.   It's not his first visit to Australia, but it is his first visit to Australia as Foreign Minister and his  first  visit  to Perth.  Indeed,  it's  the  first  visit  to Australia by a Cuban Foreign Minister since  1995, and we welcome that very much.   

 It is indeed the return visit to my own visit to Havana in November last year, which was also  the first visit by an Australian Foreign Minister to Cuba since 1995. So we've agreed that it's  way too long between drinks, and we need to work hard to ensure that 15 years don't elapse  before respective visits again.   

 This  morning  we  visited  Royal  Perth  Hospital,  and  inspected  the  Burns  Unit  and  the  state   major  trauma  unit  in  the  company  of  Dr  Fiona  Wood.  That  reflects  Cuba's,  not  just  keen   interest in medical assistance, medical technology, and medical expertise, but it also reflects  the  fact  that  Cuba  is  internationally  renowned  for  the  medical  assistance  work  that  it  does.    Not  just  in  the  Caribbean,  in  its  own  region,  but  far  broader  than  that.  Indeed,  Minister   Rodriguez has just come from East Timor, where Cuba, through a medical facility, trains up  to 700 East Timorese in the medical profession.   

 One of the things that we've discussed is the potential for Australia and Cuba to collaborate on  development assistance in the medical area. Australia, of course, has had for a long period of  time,  as  part  of  its  development  assistance  program,  medical  assistance,  including  in  key   areas, such as child and maternal health care, HIV/AIDS, and immunisation.   

 So  we're  looking  at  what  we  can  do  together,  in  the  Pacific.   And  also  potentially  in  the   Caribbean, in terms of collaboration on development assistance in the medical area.

 We also spoke about enhancing the bilateral relationship between Australia and Cuba. When I  was  in  Havana  we  signed  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  between  our  respective   Ministries, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Cuban Ministry for Foreign 

 Affairs, on general political, and bilateral cooperation.   

 We  have  in  existence  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  on  sporting  matters,  and  we're   looking at enhancing both our sporting and cultural contacts. We are looking, in addition to  general collaboration, on the development assistance front, as to whether a memorandum of  understanding can be struck between us in that area.   

 The  Minister's  visit  here  and  the  discussions  we've  had,  reflect  very  much  the  Australian   Government's  desires,  not  just  to  enhance  our  bilateral  relationship  with  Cuba,  but  also  to   enhance our bilateral relationships with the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.   

 In  November  of  last  year,  in  the  margins  of  the  Commonwealth  Heads  of  Government   meeting,  we  signed  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  with  the  CARICOM  countries,  the   countries  of  the  Caribbean.   Earlier  this  year,  for  the  first  time,  as  an  Australian  Foreign   Minister  I  attended  a  meeting  of  the  foreign  ministers  of  the  Caribbean  countries,  or   CARICOM, in Dominica.   

 So,  we're  very  pleased  to  enhance  our  engagement  with  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean.   We're very pleased to enhance our engagement with Cuba. We believe there is good work that  we can do together in the development assistance area, particularly on the medical front. And  we look forward, Bruno, to progressing that with you.   

 I'd like to invite Foreign Minister Rodriguez to make some opening remarks, and then we're  able  to  answer  questions  for  a  short  time,  and  then  we're  off  to  have  an  official  lunch.  So,   Bruno, over to you.   

 BRUNO  RODRIGUEZ:  Thank  you.  Thank  you  very  much  Minister  Smith.  I'm  really   enjoying my visit in Perth and Western Australia. I paid a wonderful visit today's morning to  an outstanding hospital, and met this fabulous person, who is Dr Fiona Wood, and was really  pleased  to  be  enlightened  on  core  elements  of  the  healthcare  system  in  Western  Australia.   And I saw very close links between healthcare practices here and in our healthcare system in  Cuba.   

 We  could  have  excellent  exchange  in  our  programs  of  international  medical  cooperation  in   this region with six small Pacific islands, and a huge medical deployment, after requests are  made by Timorese Government. Several years ago, as Minister Smith said, we committed to  train  a  thousand  Timorese  doctors.  Right  now  we  have  911  on  their  different  medicine   courses. Around 700 in Dili, and the difference in Cuban territory.   

 And  at  the  same  time  I  was  impressed  about  the  efficient  job  made  by  the  Timorese   Government, and change in healthcare figures. And it happens because of the governmental  commitment, and also with the humble contribution of around 200 Cuban doctors right now  deployed in the whole geography of East Timor.

 We  have  had  an  excellent  bilateral  talks  today's  morning.  I  feel  really  pleased  about  the   current trend of bilateral exchanges between Australia and Cuba. The special progress made  during  the  tenure  of  this  Government,  of  the  Prime  Minister  Rudd's  Government,  and   especially after the bench mark, which was the official visit paid by Minister Smith to Havana  city last November.   

 Secondly, I feel really glad about the level of exchanges in political cooperation or economic  issues between both Governments. That it has been discussed in our talks this morning.   

 Thirdly,  I  feel  an  opportunity  for  both  our  countries  enhancing  triangular  cooperation   focussed, maybe, in small Pacific islands in the field of medicine, research and care services.  And also I made  an invitation to Minister Smith to enhance our triangular cooperation with  the Haitian Government, after the terrible and painful earthquake that happened last January  there.   

 Finally  I  would  like  express  gratitude  to  the  Australian  Government  and  to  the  Australian   people because of their stand in favour of the international law of the free navigation and in  favour of the international commercial rules. The Australian support of the resolution passed 

 every  year  by  the  General  Assembly  of  the  United  Nations,  urging  for  the  cease  of  the   American blockade against Cuba.   

 Thank you very much.   

 STEPHEN SMITH:  Thanks  Minister,  thanks  very  much.  We're  pleased  to  respond  to   questions on the bilateral relationship and once we've exhausted those, I'm happy to deal with  any  other  matters  that  people  need  to  raise  with  me.  We've  probably  got  about  10  or  so  

 minutes.   

 QUESTION:  Is  there  cooperation  already  between  Australian  medical  personnel  in  East   Timor and Cuba - the Cuban provinces? There is a level where they're together?   

 STEPHEN SMITH:  There's  no  on  the  ground  cooperation.  But  we  believe  because  of  our   mutual interest in development assistance, in having medical expertise and medical services  as part of that, there is a lot of potential to join together both potentially in the Pacific, in our  backyard, in our region, but also in the Caribbean.   

 Both in the Pacific and in the Caribbean you, of course, have small island states, low income,  in  need  of  capacity  building  and  so  given  Cuba's  world  class  credentials  in  the  medical   training  area,  given  our  world  class  expertise  in  child  and  maternal  health  care,  we  believe   that there is potential for us to work together. And that's what we're exploring.   

 We  also,  this  morning,  as  the  Minister  has  indicated,  spoke  about  Australia's  substantial   contribution to Haiti, which reflected the enormity of the disaster in Haiti, but also reflected  our  enhanced  engagement  with  the  CARICOM  countries  and  the  Caribbean.  And  Cuba  is   pursuing a long-term reconstruction health facility in the Haiti and we're looking at whether  Australia can play some small part in that.

 But we think very much the potential is there in both of our regions.  QUESTION: Minister Rodriguez mentioned earlier that the blockade and Australia's support  for Cuba for ending that blockade.   

 Do  you  have  an  updated  position  on  Australia's  view  on  how  serious  that  concern  is,  and   whether more should be done?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: Australia's position is of longstanding, shared by Governments of both  political  persuasion  and  it's  reflected  every  year  by  our  support  of  Cuba  in  the  General   Assembly resolution which is essentially to cease the economic and commercial blockade of  Cuba.  That's  a  longstanding  position,  longstanding  Australian  Government  and  Australian   policy,  well  understood  by  Cuba  and  appreciated  by  Cuba,  but  also  well  understood  by  the   United States.   

 QUESTION: But it's - that's the point, it's longstanding and it's - the problem's still there. I  mean is there a…   

 STEPHEN SMITH:  Well  it…    

 QUESTION: …need for emergency, or…?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: …it continues to be our view that the blockade should be lifted. That's  been Australia's position for a long period of time.   

 QUESTION: Minister, does Australia have any concerns for human rights issues in Cuba?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: Human rights is one of the matters that we spoke about in the course of  the morning. I think there are two aspects to our human rights discussions. One is we struck  up,  as  I  indicated,  a  Memorandum of  Understanding  between  our  respective  departments  in   Havana last year. This sets the scene for a political and foreign policy dialogue and we very  much  regard  human  rights  issues,  or  human  rights  matters  as  part  of  that,  so  we  had  a   conversation about these matters.   

 Secondly,  we  have  what  is  very  important  to  both  Cuba  and  Australia  under  the  Human   Rights  Council,  is  the  universal  periodic  reviews.  Cuba  took  part  in  the  universal  periodic   review  in  2009  and  Australia  made  a  submission  to  that  review.  Australia  is  up  for  our   universal periodic review before the Human Rights Council next year, 2011.   

 So  this  is  part  of  our  bilateral  exchanges.  It's  also  part  of  our  commitment  to  a  multilateral   discussion  of  human  rights  through  the  universal  periodic  review  under  the  United  Nations   Human Rights Council.   

 BRUNO  RODRIGUEZ:  We  have  had  an  exchange  of  views  in  a  very  broad  range  of   international or bilateral issues. And as part of this a comprehensive political agenda, we have  had  had  discussions  on  human  rights  fields,  on  reciprocal  basis,  equal  footing  and  fully   respect  for  the  constitutional  order  of  both  parties.  And  I  feel  that  our  cooperation  in

 international fora regarding a concrete exercise for the all human rights.  I mean that not only  civil, or political rights, but social, economic and cultural rights for every citizen worldwide  could  be  a  common  goal  and  a  basis  for  having  substantial  change  in  international  fora   involving these matters.  QUESTION:  What's  your  reaction  to  the  latest  deaths  of  two  Australian  soldiers  in   Afghanistan?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: It  of  course,  is  very  tragic.  It's  especially  tragic  for  the  families   concerned and for the friends and loved ones of the two deceased servicemen. At this stage, of  course, respecting the wishes of the families, we're not naming the individuals concerned, so  we'll allow that to take its natural course.   

 But it's been a substantial period of time, almost a year, since we suffered our last casualties  in Afghanistan. It's a multiple casualty, the first time it's occurred since the Vietnam War, so  there will be a special grieving at this moment and our thoughts and our hearts are with the  families.   

 QUESTION: How much longer are we intending to stay in there?   

 STEPHEN SMITH:  We've  never  put  a  timetable  on  our  commitment  to  Afghanistan.  We   are there because we very much see Afghanistan, the Afghanistan/Pakistan border area as one  of the current hotbeds or danger points so far as international terrorism is concerned.   

 Australians have regrettably been on the receiving end of that, whether it's in Jakarta or Bali,  or  London.   So  our  commitment  in  Oruzgan  province  is  to  help  train  the  Afghan  security   forces so they're in a position to look after their own affairs.   

 But, we also very strongly agree with the strategy that's been effected since President Obama  came to office which is: this is not an issue which will be resolved by military conduct alone,  it  requires  action  on  the  security  front  and  military  enforcement.  It  also  requires  a  political   outcome,  and  it  also  requires  assistance  on  the  civilian  front,  on  capacity  building,  on   development  assistance,  and  in  recent  months  the  Prime  Minister  and  I  have  announced  an  

 enhanced Australian contribution on that front.   

 But we haven't, we don't, we never put a timetable on our commitment to Afghanistan, other  than to very strongly make the point that our commitment is to be there, together with the rest  of the international community to stare down international terrorism.   

 QUESTION:  Can  you  confirm  the  matter  of  the  freeze  on  processing  of  some  asylum   seekers.  Can  you  confirm  that  the  government's  humanitarian  program is  unaffected  by  that   freeze  and  if  that's  the  case  then  isn't  it  possible  that  we're  still  getting  refugees  from  Sri  

 Lanka and Afghanistan?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: The pause in respect of Sri Lanka and Afghanistan applies in respect of  unauthorised arrivals, either by boat or by plane. And the pause in respect of Sri Lanka will be  reviewed after the three month period to which we are very close, and with Afghanistan, after 

 the  six  month  period.  That  pause  was  never  intended  to,  nor  does  it  affect  our  general  

 

  6

 humanitarian program with is an offshore program done in conjunction with the UNHCR and  I'm sure Senator Evans, the Minister, has and will confirm that.   

 QUESTION: And  when  can  we  expect  an  announcement  on  who  will  partner  Australia  in   Oruzgan?  STEPHEN SMITH: We are waiting in the first instance until the Dutch elections which are  imminent, and the formation of a Dutch Government to see what role, if any, the Dutch can  continue to play in Oruzgan province.   

 Of  course  given  the  uncertainty  that  that  creates  we  have  obviously  been  in  discussions  not   just  with  the  United  States,  but  also  with  International  Security  Assistance  Force,  ISAF,  in   Kabul itself.   

 We have made it clear that in a military sense we are not in a position to take the leadership  role  in  Oruzgan  province.   That  goes  to  our  overall  military  capacity  and  the  commitments   and contributions we're making throughout the world. But these are matters which will come  to  a  conclusion  or  a  finalisation  in  the  aftermath  of  the  formation  of  a  new  Dutch   administration.  But  obviously  we  have  been  in  very  close  discussion  with  our  friends  and   colleagues in ISAF about that matter.   

 QUESTION: Can you provide an update on the Australian woman in Yemen?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: Yes.  I spoke last night to my Yemeni counterpart, to Yemen's Foreign  Minister Dr al-Qirbi. It has been agreed between Australian and Yemen that together with her  children  she  will  be  deported  from  Yemen  by  the  end  of  this  week,  and  she  will  return  to   Australia together with her two children.   

 In the meantime she continues to receive consular support from Australian officers who have  gone to the Yemen and that consular support includes ongoing contact, not just with her but  with the children.   

 So I'm very pleased that this development has occurred overnight. We put the view through  officials that there was no reason why the children could not return home.  In the event, the  Yemeni authorities have come to the conclusion that the most appropriate course of action is  the  deportation  of  the  woman  together  with  her  children.  We  welcome  the  fact  that  the   children will be returning to Australia in the company of their mother.   

 QUESTION: Just in regards to the Chinese navy patrol boats being launched in East Timor,  will this further strain relations between Australia and East Timor?   

 STEPHEN SMITH:  Absolutely  not.   We've  known  for  some  time  that  East  Timor  was   proposing  to  receive  two  patrol  boats  from  China.  East  Timor  is  an  independent  sovereign   nation. It's perfectly entitled to enter into whatever agreement it wants in terms of its defence  or security assets.   

 We continue to have a United Nations sponsored and mandated force in East Timor, assisting  East  Timor  with  its  security  arrangements.  Our  level  has  reduced  slightly  over  the  last  12  

 

  7

 months and that's a good thing as East Timor becomes more capable of looking after its own  security  arrangements.  It's  perfectly  appropriate  for  East  Timor  to  look  to  more  than  one   country for its defence or security assets.   

 QUESTION:  [Inaudible  question]    

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well in respect of the resources tax, I make the same point that I made  last  week  when  I  spoke  to  a  group  of  business  people  in  Western  Australia.  I  very  much   believe  what  is  now  needed  is  a  period  of  calm  discussion  and  calm  negotiations  and  calm  

 deliberation through the government process.   

 We've seen, as I described it earlier, some overblown statements, and we've seen in the last  couple of days some retractions of some overblown statements. I think the time has come for  people to do their talking and their thinking behind closed doors and to stop the noise outside  closed doors.   

 More generally, it's the season for opinion polls and the seasons for the onset of an election  campaign. And I know that I hate using the trite formula and I know you hate receiving it, but  in the end there'll be one poll that counts.   

 And in that I make the same point that a number of my colleagues have made. It's often very  easy to view a government or a political party, or political personalities in isolation. In the end  the Australian community has to make a choice between the Government and its Liberal Party  opponents, and I remain of the view that in the  end  the  community  won't  take  the  risk  of  a   Tony Abbott prime ministership or a Tony Abbott government. That would be too much of a  risk on the economic front, and too much of a risk on the national security front.   

 Thanks very much.   

 BRUNO RODRIGUEZ: Thank you.
