 Fewer Detainees Prove Immigration Policies Working Well

 Australia’s immigration policies are working, with the lowest number of people held in detention - excluding illegal foreign fishers - since 1999.

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today fewer people - not including illegal  foreign fishers - were in detention than at any time in the last six years (as at 21 December 2005).

 And the majority of the 535 detainees - excluding illegal fishers - had either overstayed their visas or had breached visa conditions.

 ‘Fewer people are detained now, thanks to the Government’s success at stopping unauthorised boat arrivals and our flexible approach to  immigration detention,’ Senator Vanstone said. ‘Our approach has included introducing new visas for long-term detainees and residence  determination arrangements for families. 

 ‘There are 76 detainees living in the community under residence determinations, including 40 children.

 ‘The Government also has introduced a number of Palmer-related initiatives including the appointment of detention review managers and more  case management support.’ 

 The Minister said most of the 535 people in immigration detention (excluding illegal foreign fishers) were compliance cases where rules governing  immigration had been broken.

 ‘They were detained for either overstaying their visas or breaching their visa conditions,’ the Minister said. ‘Only 16 of total detainees were  unauthorised boat arrivals.

 ‘Less than 30 per cent of detainees are actually seeking asylum. At this time, only 26 people had primary protection visa applications before the  department. Most asylum seekers arrive in Australia with a valid visa and live in the community while they pursue their claims,’ she said. 

 More than half the total detainees had been detained for less than three months.

 People continued to move through detention facilities. Since 1 January this year, 6,613 people have been placed in immigration detention and 6,830  have been released or removed.

 ‘There will always be a need for detention facilities and my department is committed to ensuring fair and reasonable treatment and services are  provided at all times,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 (NOTE: Of the 805 people in immigration detention as at 9 December 2005, 270 - 32 per cent - were illegal foreign fishers. These people  generally remain in detention for a short period of time before being returned home.)
