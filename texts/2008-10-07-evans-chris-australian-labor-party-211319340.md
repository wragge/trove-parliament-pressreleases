 People smuggling vessel intercepted 

 Tuesday 7 October 2008 

 Seventeen people are being transported to Christmas Island after a suspected  people smuggling vessel docked alongside a floating production offshore storage  facility in the Timor Sea yesterday. 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans said 14  passengers and three crew members were on board the vessel. 

 The group of passengers on board consists of 16 males and one female. Their  nationalities, ages and reasons for their voyage are yet to be confirmed. 

 A Royal Australian Navy vessel now carrying the group is expected to arrive at  Christmas Island later this week. The group will be held in detention while they  undergo health, security, identity and other checks to establish their identity and  reasons for their voyage. 

 Senator Evans said it was the second unauthorised boat arrival this year. There  were five unauthorised boats last year carrying a total of 148 people, six in 2006 (60  people) and four in 2005 (11 people). 

 'The Labor Government has maintained extensive patrolling of our borders by  Defence and Customs and has consistently made clear its commitment to maintain a  system of mandatory detention and excision,' Senator Evans said. 

 'The government has also renewed efforts to work closely with regional countries  including Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand to prevent and deter people from  attempting dangerous sea journeys to Australia.' 

 All unauthorised boat arrivals will be detained and processed on Christmas Island  and those found not to be owed protection will be removed. 

 Department of Immigration officials have completed initial interviews with the  fourteen people intercepted on a boat near the Ashmore Islands last week. 

 Three of the group are Iranian nationals. Nine are from Afghanistan, which includes  two teenagers. The two crew members are Indonesian nationals, one of whom is  also a teenager. 

 The Iranian and Afghan nationals have all indicated they do not wish to return to their  home countries. They will remain in detention on Christmas Island while immigration  officials make a thorough assessment of any claims under Australia’s international  protection obligations. 

 All of the adults will remain in immigration detention while security and other related  checks are done. The juveniles are in alternative accommodation.   

 The Australian Federal Police is continuing to interview the Indonesian crew  members and passengers. 

 'Attempting to breach Australia’s borders and the integrity of its immigration system  is a serious matter and the government will continue to take robust measures to  protect Australia’s borders,' Senator Evans said. 

 'People smuggling is an insidious trade where criminals exploit vulnerable people  whose lives may be put at risk.'
