 Bob Brown, Senator for Tasmania   

 

 Government should close Nauru camp immediately 

 17th May 04 

  The granting of refugee status to 77 Afghan asylum seekers on Nauru is welcome but  long overdue and the government must bring the remaining detainees to Australia  immediately, Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.   

 "Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone has finally acknowledged the legitimacy of  the claims of the Afghan asylum seekers but not before putting them through the hell  of detention on a Pacific island out of scrutiny of the Australian people and media,"  Senator Brown said.   

 "Her decision is a first victory for the Australian Flotillas of Hope, which is sailing to  the island state to highlight the plight of the asylum seekers.    

 "The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report on children in  immigration detention last week revealed the frightful consequences of the mandatory  detention regime and called for the release of all children from immigration detention. 

 

 "The Greens says long-term detention is unsuitable for any person, child or adult,  claiming asylum.   

 "Minister Vanstone must now bring the remaining asylum seekers on Nauru to  Australia," Senator Brown said.
