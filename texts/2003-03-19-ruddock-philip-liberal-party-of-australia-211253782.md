 Philip Ruddock MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 

 Another Detention Centre Mothballed

 MPS 17/2003

 The temporary immigration detention centre on Christmas Island will be mothballed following the departure of the last  residents, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock said today.

 Four people who had been held as unauthorised boat arrivals departed for Afghanistan late last week and the remaining three  people have been transferred to Nauru.

 The centre will be held in a state of readiness so that it can be re-activated at short notice should there be further boat arrivals.

 The Christmas Island move follows the decision announced last week to mothball the centre at Woomera by mid-April.

 This in no way derogates from the commitment for a permanent facility on the island.
