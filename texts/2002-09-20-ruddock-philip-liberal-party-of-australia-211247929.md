 Mr Ruddock launches Family Visitor Network, Melbourne Introduction

 Mr Ruddock launched the Family Visitor Network in Melbourne on 20 September. The Family Visitor Network is designed to make visiting Australia eaiser by providing correct and current information to potential visitors.

 Launch Speech: Philip Ruddock

 Well, thankyou very much, John Williams, and can I acknowledge my State Parliamentary colleague, who's here, Member for Templestowe, I believe, Mr Furletti, and can I also say Reverend Father, and distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.

 First I'd like to acknowledge, in my role as Minister for Indigenous Affairs, the Wurundjeri people. Their rich heritage is part of our heritage, and we very much respect that - their culture. The first Australians. I think all of who are descendants of those who have followed should make and understand, I think, as Peris-Kneebone recently said at a function that I attended in Canberra - she was just simply observing that Indigenous culture is Australian, and all Australians should be proud of it, and share in it.

 But today I'm here for another purpose. Today is about some good news. And I want to share this good news with you, because it's as a result of the fact that we see some very significant changes in the way in which people are entering and seeing in Australia that we have been able to make some very important modifications and developments to the arrangements that we've put in place.

 The first is that visitor visas, and particularly from what have often been seen as emerging markets, has been improving very significantly. The approval rates have gone up over a period of time - globally - by 97.94%. So it's not the big markets of the UK, North America, Japan. It's the emerging markets - places like China, and India - where we've seen a very big increase in approval rates.

 And so, if you look at those approval rates, which have been going up, you find also that the non-return rates have been falling. And now the non-return rates are at an all-time low. It's 1.85%, and that is the first time ever that the non-return rate globally has been below two per cent. First time ever. And the rates and absolute numbers of people who come as a visitor and then apply for refugee status has been falling. And it's now down to 0.15%.

 Now this success has been, I think, possible, because we've been working very hard at getting a better understanding of the sorts of criteria that we apply in relation to dealing with visitors, and we've introduced a number of important arrangements. And I might say there are a number of communities that have said "We want to work positively with you, the Department, because we believe our people will be best served if - if we are able to do so."

 And I just want to share this with you. I mean, increasingly what we have been doing is saying to people - community leaders like yourselves -people in positions of responsibility, like members of Parliament, and others - that if you can vouch for people in a way which is - in a way which is giving your assurance that we're dealing with somebody that will do the right thing - if they're coming as a visitor they'll stay for the amount of time - they'll go home - they wont breach visa conditions and work when they're not given permission to do so - we will accept your assurance. We will accept your assurance.

 That's not in every case. If we know something that you don't we may save you the embarrassment. But I tell you we will accept your assurance, and we will accept it once. And if there is any breach then you would not expect us to accept it again.

 And that's a very important - a very important approach - to say that. It's an approach that applies to members of Parliament in the same way that it applies to everybody else. And I tell you when you're going round to meet some of your colleagues in the Parliament, that they gave their word to you, and they didn't make sufficient inquiries, it certainly concentrates the mind.

 I can remember when somebody came to me on one occasion and asked me - twisted my arm long before I was Minister - and said "You will, Minister, wont you, give this assurance on behalf of me and my family, because you've known us for so long. And you've known my community for so long."

 And then I think the week after the fellow arrived, he said "Oh, I think I've discovered my life's - my life's love in Australia, and I don't think I need to go back, now, thankyou very much." And I said "Well, if you've discovered your life's love in Australia better go home and apply to come back

 properly, because we've given our word, haven't we. Haven't we." And I said, "You know, you can safely assume that your word given to me means I'm in breach. I wont be helping anybody from your family, or whom you know well, in the future, if we can't rely on you."

 I mean, it's a - it is that sort of arrangement. I want to say that very clearly. But it has been having quite a significant impact. And I want to thank community representatives that are here today that have been making it known to people abroad that you can make a difference. That if we have compliant movements - compliant movements - it is better for everybody.

 And I know some communities have been doing that. And I don't wish to single them out, but you can rest assured that where people are working co-operatively with us it does make a difference. And I can think of some communities where the efforts of the community has made a difference. And we are in a position to know.

 Australia is one of the few countries in the world that has accurate information about everyone who has come. And if they've failed to go, we know. And we can take that into account in the way in which we look at the individual cases, and the way in which we look at people's backgrounds and their dealings with us. We have more comprehensive information about the movement in and out of Australia than any other country.

 Essentially, in granting visitor visas there is only one test, and that is is somebody undertaking a genuine visit? And if they have some other purpose in mind then it's not a genuine visit. And what we want to do is ensure that people understand the nature of the processes. That they understand that if you are required to satisfy us that a genuine visit is intended that we need certain information that will help us in reaching a decision.

 And it's not a matter of saying "Oh, look, the Department should know me and my family, we have such a grand reputation we should assume that the Department will know everything there is to know about us. It's a matter of ensuring that you provide the information of the sort that we're going to assist you, and understanding may be required.

 And we are putting together this comprehensive information kit. And it includes a number of forms in a promotional folder about the Family Visitor Network, the health requirements for temporary entry to Australia, and the general requirements for visiting Australia.

 It outlines the policies, the procedures, and the processes by which decisions are made. And it explains what is meant by a genuine visit, and the criteria that must be satisfied. It also has in it some information which includes frequently asked questions.

 And, of course, the health issue is to explain to people why, because we have the best health standards in the world, that we don't wish to compromise those. We don't wish to leave Australians likely to contract some disease that they wouldn't otherwise contract.

 And so this kit is important, I think, for people understanding the processes that are involved. And it's also, I think, important that people know and understand that the Family Visitor Network is also about giving people a point of contact with the Department here, so that if you want to get some further information you are able to do so.

 One thing I have to tell you is that in dealing with the Family Visitor Network we're not changing the basis upon which decisions are being taken. I want to make that very clear. The decisions are as to whether or not bona fide visits are intended. But what we want to have is, within the community, a good understanding of the sorts of criteria that we are going to consider when dealing with these matters.

 And what you will have is a DIMA Community Liaison Officer or a Family Visitor Network Officer in each capital city, and so there will be such an officer here in Melbourne that you can contact for assistance. Now, these officers wont be involved in making the individual decisions. Those decisions will still be made overseas. But it is designed to ensure that if you have some information that you think could be useful in making a decision, that the officer is able to make sure that that information is passed on to a decision maker.

 Now, I don't know that I need to say very much more about that, other than that I think that what we've been able to do in recent years has indicated our willingness to work with communities to get better outcomes. And we are getting better outcomes, and I think the extent to which we can co-operate further in relation to these matters will be of considerable assistance.

 I want to finally say that we have also been looking at some of the methodology for dealing with issues relating to where you might look more closely at particular applications. That is, where there are risk factors. And you may know that we've recently released a discussion paper which is canvassing those methodologies, and which I hope will help further in developing more efficacious means of being able to assess visitor applications. And if any of you have comments on that that you would like to let me see, I'd encourage you to do so.

 Finally, John said that I'd be speaking to you today about the Migration Agents' Information Kit. I do want to introduce this kit to you, because it's important, I think, for those people that are regularly dealing with community members who may often be in touch with migration agents.

 And the situation here is that this kit that we are launching here in Victoria today is designed to give people a better understanding of the migration advice industry. And it's to help people who need assistance with visa applications to know what their rights are when dealing with migration agents.

 And the fact is migration agents are there to serve. And while they might want to make some reasonable money from their knowledge and expertise in assisting you, we want to ensure that in doing so they assist in an ethical way, in a professional way, and in a way which is not exploitative of people's vulnerability.

 There is legislation that governs migration agents. And the kit outlines that advice in the Migration Act, that deals with the registration of agents. The kit deals with the difference between a registered migration agent, and an unregistered agent, and the process for people who wish to become registered.

 It also has in it, as the Family Information kit did, answers to frequently asked questions. And it also has some information there about how to select a migration agent to help with a visa application or sponsorship. How to make a complaint if that becomes necessary. It also outlines the code of conduct which migration agents are required to follow. And the required knowledge and the detailed knowledge that they're expected to have about migration law and procedures.

 It also has copies of the forms you might need for both nomination and complaints. And it also has contact information for the Migration Agents' Registration Authority, as well as the Migration Institute of Australia, and my Department, if you wish to explore those matters further.

 It is important to know that it is not a requirement, when dealing with the Department, that you actually use a migration agent. It's only a question of choice if you do. Let me just say most migration agents are highly professional and do a professional job, but there are some that don't.

 And it is important that the issues in relation to complaints and matters where people might be exploitative - if they're charging unreasonably high fees, or if they're not well-serving their clients, or they're suggesting an approach which is unethical, that we are appraised of that. In other words, that people make their complaints known to the relevant authorities.

 Now, you should know that I do see migration agents as there to serve. I think they do need to do the right thing by their clients. And it's one of the reasons that this information is being published now - so that you can be in a position to help us in ensuring that we get the best possible advice industry here in Australia.

 I have to say that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has recently conducted a review of the self-regulation of the migration advice industry. That report will be shortly published.

 I know coming out of that review my colleague Gary Hardgrave, who I've asked to look at these issues in relation to migration agents, will be introducing a range of measures to strengthen the code of conduct by which migration agents are required to conduct their practices. And he will also be seeking certain additional powers to aid the Migration Agents Registration Authority to deal with unscrupulous or incompetent agents. And I believe that legislation will be considered fairly shortly.

 Now this kit, of course, complements changes arising from the review that Mr Hardgrave has been undertaking, and it does give me a great deal of pleasure, ladies and gentlemen, to declare officially launched these two publications, the Family Visitor Network and the Migration Agents Information kit. Thankyou very much.
