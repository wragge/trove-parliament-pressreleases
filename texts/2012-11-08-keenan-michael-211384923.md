 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 500 BOATS, 500 POLICY FAILURES November 08, 2012

 500  boats  represent  500  policy  failures  that  have  arrived  since  Labor  was  elected  in  2007,  cementing  Julia  Gillard’s   reputation  as  the  worst  steward  of  our  borders  in  Australia’s  history,  Shadow  Minister  for  Immigration  and  Citizenship,   Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “Today is a dark day for Australia. This milestone has come with great cost, chaos and tragedy. The only winners are the people smugglers,” Mr Morrison said.

 “A responsible government would not have created this crisis. This is failure that only an election will change,” he said.

 “It was Julia Gillard who said ‘another boat, another policy failure’. There have now been 500 such policy failures under  Labor, of which a staggering 72% have occurred on her watch.

 “The people smuggling cancer has strong roots under Labor. Five years of Labor failure has seen it grow massively, not just in Indonesia but across continents to new markets of misery.

 “2012  is  already  the  all  time  record  year  for  boats  with  228  arrivals  and  14,400  people  on  board  including  over  3,000 people from Sri Lanka. Smugglers know this Prime Minister and this government has neither the policies nor the resolve to beat them.

 “Labor’s record continues to grow at startling speed under their half hearted measures and failure of resolve. Arrivals this financial  year  are  running  at  over  2,000  people  a  month  - including  over  750  on  15  boats  in  just  the  first  week  of  November.

 “An  election  next  year  will  allow  Australians  the  opportunity  to  stop  the  boats  by  electing  a  Coalition  government,  a government that will possess not only the proven measures to get the job done but also the necessary resolve to wipe away the people smugglers,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “500 illegal boat arrivals have been successfully smuggled to Australia under Labor’s watch - more than  double the amount that arrived under the entire 12 years of the Howard Government.

 “15 boats carrying 764 people in just one week is not only completely unsustainable but it highlights the dire state that the Gillard Government has reduced Australia’s borders to.

 “Labor tries to talk the talk on tough border protection policies but ultimately all they have achieved is greater incentives for people smugglers and less funding and resources for our frontline agencies trying to combat this trade.

 “We need an election and a Coalition Government that has the necessary resolve to put an end to this constant flood of illegal boats at our borders,” Mr Keenan said.
