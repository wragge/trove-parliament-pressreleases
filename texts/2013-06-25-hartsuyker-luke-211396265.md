 Hartsuyker highlights importance of 457 visas to local  blueberry industry  Federal MP Luke Hartsuyker has highlighted the importance of 457 visas to both the  nation and the Coffs Coast. 

 During a speech in the Federal Parliament, Mr Hartsuyker said the Gillard  Government was trying to distract Australians from their border protection failings on  asylum seekers by demonising those on 457 visas. 

 “The 457 migration program plays an important role in securing short- and long-term  skilled migrants that Australia has always needed and will need into the future, and  we need certainty,” Mr Hartsuyker told the Parliament.  

 “In my electorate there is a dependence on 457 visas. Over the past decade we have  seen an explosion in the blueberry industry on the Coffs Coast.  

 “We have seen double-digit growth in blueberry production and this has been  delivered through two major business models. Costa Berries, or Blueberry Farms of  Australia, as many know them, is a massive operation which employs more than  2,000 people over a 12-month period.  

 “They produce premium blueberry product which generates tens of millions of dollars  in wages and the cost of production, but their work is very labour intensive. Peter  McPherson of Blueberry Farms has advised me of the difficulties of recruiting highly  skilled labour in the field of horticulture.  

 “The business is reliant on the use of 457 visas and it brings workers in from  countries such as Mexico and Chile. Why does the government want to impose more  red tape on this business? Why is the government so keen to drive up the cost for  this important industry?  

 “Also on the Coffs Coast is a group of around 70 farmers who independently grow  blueberries. Many of these farmers are members of the Indian community, which is  heavily involved in the local community, particularly in the area of Woolgoolga. 

 “These farmers have got together and built a processing facility and they call their  venture Oz Berries. The ongoing expansion of Oz Berries is one of the true industry  success stories on the Coffs Coast.  

 “The exponential growth of the blueberry industry has been great for farmers and a  real boost to the local economy. Today Oz Berries employs more than 60 people and  turns over more than $27 million each year. The 70 farmers employ hundreds of  additional people on their properties.   

 “Both Oz Berries and Costa Berries are vital to our local economy and they both  need to use 457 visas in order to get the skills and the labour that they need,” Mr  Hartsuyker told Parliament.”
