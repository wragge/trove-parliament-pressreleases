 Turning boat around not an option Mr Abbott   

 “I am extremely concerned about the welfare of the people on board the boat, particularly  the 37 children who are believed to be on board”, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.     

 “The Minister must ensure that these vulnerable men, women and children are brought to  Australia immediately.    

 "Turning this boat back to India is simply not an option.    

 "If the Prime Minister intends on creating a diplomatic row with India by attempting to turn  the boat back, he needs to be up front out that.      

 “After nearly 2 weeks on board this boat these people will be extremely traumatised and in  need of care, we should be offering this to them.”   

 “Despite the Abbott governments cover up and harsh treatment of asylum seekers, the  boats are still coming.    

 “The government’s policy of cruelty has failed and will continue to fail so long as desperate  people continue to flee the horrors in their homeland.    

 “People have travelled thousands of miles in search of safety and no government spin is  going to change that.
