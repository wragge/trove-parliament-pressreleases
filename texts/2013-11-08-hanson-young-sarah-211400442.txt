 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 8 November 2013   

 Playing politics with people’s lives   

 Vulnerable refugees have been caught up in an ongoing political spat between the  Coalition and the Indonesian Government, the Australian Greens have said.   

 Amid reports of a mid-ocean standoff between Australian and Indonesian authorities  after a failed refugee boat turn-around, there is only deafening silence coming from the  Australian Government.   

 “Refugees are being used in a potentially deadly game of political brinksmanship,” the  Australian Greens immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Poor, vulnerable people are stranded on a boat in the middle of the Indian Ocean and it  appears no one is willing to help them. This is inhumane and unacceptable.   

 “The people on this boat have been turned into political pawns. The Coalition needs to  end the cruelty and bring these refugees to Australia to have their claims assessed.   

 “The government seems intent on hiding information from the public, but the Australian  people have a right to know what is being done in their names.”
