 AUSTRALIANS FIND HATE MAIL OBJECTIONABLE     

 Labor’s multicultural affairs spokesman Senator Joe Ludwig today described the  Newcastle distribution of hate mail attacking Sudanese immigrants as “sad and  pathetic.”   

 “This is a desperate attempt to try and stir up hatred in the community that just  isn’t there."   

 “I want to give a clear message to the group or individual who has done this: you  have no support. Australia’s response to the tsunami crisis in Asia shows we are  a very generous people who are prepared to help those struck by disaster.” 

 

 “Sudan has been hit by the man-made disaster of civil war, and many of the  Sudanese that these grubs are attacking would have survived horrors  unimaginable to most Australians.”   

 “The community has no tolerance for this sort of thing. If you want to debate  immigration policy then debate it - don’t go around slandering and harassing  people.” 

 

 “I wish the organisers of today’s demonstration well in their efforts against this  insidious group.”
