 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Thursday, 7 November 2013   

 Children in Australia deserve an education, not indefinite detention   

 It is shameful that the government is holding refugee children in indefinite detention on  Christmas Island and refusing to give them access to adequate education, the Australian  Greens have said.   

 “Children on Christmas Island are suffering because of this government’s indefinite  detention policy,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young  said.   

 “The problem here is political, not logistical. The government’s policy of detaining  children indefinitely is denying those children access to an adequate education.   

 “The government must put in place strict time limits for children in detention. This would  alleviate the pressure on Christmas Island’s education services and end the trauma that  indefinite detention inflicts upon children and families.   

 “Children don’t belong in detention centres, but this government’s unwavering  commitment to cruelty means it is willing to deny refugee children a proper education.   

 “The cruel and unworkable policy of indefinite detention cannot be allowed to continue,  especially for children.”
