 Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends,

 Good morning.

 It is a pleasure to be with you today.

 Forums such as these are important opportunities to discuss a range of issues critical to our future.

 Labor has argued for some time that we need a population policy, and that we need an informed debate to frame that policy.

 In this context, it is important that we all appreciate that any sensible approach to population policy will be a broad one, and a flexible one.

 We need to do a better job than we have previously to understand the interdependence of various policy positions, and what it all means for our population profile.

 A population policy for our future requires us to consider a variety of measures.

 We need to find the right combination of immigration and family-friendly policies, to address not just the size of our population, but also our age profile.

 We have to deal with our ageing population on a number of fronts, through our health and aged care systems, policies that encourage the workforce participation of older Australians, and a sustainable retirement incomes strategy.

 We have to see where people live as a central part of the population debate. In saying this, I would argue that we need to improve the way we develop our cities and regions.

 We have to care for our built and natural environment, in a way that contributes to our quality of life, and in a way that ensures all development is sustainable development.

 And finally, we have to recognise the most fundamental force underpinning our economy, and invest in our people and their ideas.

 I will come back these themes, but I would like to reiterate - an integrated approach is necessary.

 Kim Beazley has a vision for Australia as a Knowledge Nation.

 That is a nation that sees the skills, capacities and ideas of our people as the driver of our progress as a nation.

 It is also a vision that sees a renewed emphasis on engaging with a broad range of Australians - giving all Australians a say in the decisions that affect their lives.

 Population scale and age profile

 Kim and I have argued previously for a moderate increase in our population, including through higher immigration, over the next 50 years.

 On the basis of the evidence that we have seen, and the views of the experts in the debate, that is both environmentally sustainable and to our economic benefit.

 We have not fixed a figure on a population target, as that both fails to appreciate the uncertainty involved.

 It also distracts attention from the real challenge at hand - to develop an integrated agenda for the sustainable development of our economies and communities.

 Having said that we won't specify a figure, I have consistently opposed the suggestions by some in the business community that Australia's population should be up near 50 million by the middle of the century.

 I don't believe anywhere near that number is sustainable.

 Population Debate

 As the population debate has gained momentum over the past few years, and I am pleased to say that Labor has led the Government in that process, the issue of our ageing population has come to the fore.

 Some have noted that our ageing problem is not as acute as many other countries, and that it should therefore be given less importance.

 I reject that view. The policies that address the ageing of our population are good public policies in themselves.

 They are policies that ensure that we can pay our way in the world, and that the expenditure we choose to make for non-economic reasons can be afforded.

 Policies that reward work, facilitate lifestyle choices for our people, and encourage an active and healthy society, are policies that help address our ageing population.

 Policies that relate to retirement, such as on superannuation, pensions and aged care, are policies that must help to sustain a decent and egalitarian society.

 Immigration

 Our immigration policies are also relevant in this context, although I would note that it is fertility rather than immigration that has the greatest impact on our age profile.

 Our immigration program must balance competing objectives - if we only took the economic perspective, we should be favouring young, highly skilled migrants.

 But we must also fulfil our responsibilities as a decent society - and that means recognising the family circumstances of the people who choose to make Australia home, through famly reunion.

 It also means recognising our international responsibilities to our fellow human beings who are fleeing persecution or oppression, or simply no longer have anywhere that they call home.

 Regional Development

 To those who argue that we need a higher population, I would suggest part of that approach must be able to say: where?

 The answer is not easy, but if you believe in regional development, then you have to examine options to attract and retain skilled people, particularly young people, in our regions.

 That means creating real opportunities for people in regional Australia - to work, to study, to access services, and to participate in a variety of lifestyle-related activities.

 It is why Labor is looking at strengthening regional universities and TAFEs, and why we believe in more opportunities for regionally-based industries.

 The real story of regional Australia, as with our cities, is a mixed one. Some regions and some communities are charging ahead. Many are not.

 Labor's approach to regional development will be one that promotes both excellence and equity.

 All cities and regions need to improve the way they meet their challenges.

 But some areas, both in regional Australia and in our cities, will need additional support in that process.

 In the context of immigration, we have already stated that we will be promoting migration to our regions - partly in recognition of the environmental challenges facing our cities, and partly because we believe in regional development.

 Labor has a strong history in the area of regional development - dating back to the decentralisation era in the 1940s, Whitlam's regional centres growth strategy, and more recently, the Working Nation regional development programs.

 However, it is fair to say that the history of regional development is one of mixed success.

 When the Howard Governement came into office, one of their first acts was to declare that there is no role for our national government in regional development.

 They proceeded to abolish the Office of Regional Development, and abandon all of Labor's programs

 supporting regional infrastructure, delivering regional services, and fostering regional leadership.

 When people write about Australian political history of the late 20th century, I believe that John Howard's decision to abandon regional development will be seen as a grave error of judgment.

 Sustainable Development

 One of my priorities in the context of my portfolios - regional development, regional services, transport, infrastructure and population -will be to work to ensure that any development we have is sustainable.

 Sustainability needs to be at the heart of a regional development agenda.

 In this context, we have to move forward on hard issues of natural resource management, and the environmental performance of our industries.

 That requires change in the way landholders and businesses do things, and we all know that this is not easy.

 But, just as with debates about globalisation and trade, change is nto something that we can choose to reject.

 Perhaps the most important role of Government today is to manage change, include people in the process of change, and ensure that the costs and benefits of change are shared fairly.

 I would urge people to look at Labor's population policy in this context -of sustainable development that aims to enhance the quality of life for people across our nation.

 A lower population?

 To those who argue for a lower population, I suggest that you examine that approach in the context of a few global realities.

 First, the size of our population does affect our economic opportunities in a global economy, hence the interests of the business community in arguing for a higher population.

 Economic development produces jobs for our people. The challenge is not to reject development, but to ensure that it is sustainable, and that it actually improves our quality of life.

 Secondly, we face the possibility in coming decades of a global refugee problem that could present us with some tough challenges.

 We face challenges in relation to the dislocation that results from conflicts that leave people without a safe homeland - and we have seen that with both Kosovo and, closer to our shores, East Timor.

 In such cases, we can not simply ignore our international responsibilities.

 I raise this to highlight the uncertainty that confronts all of us in this debate.

 This uncertainty is one reason I am hesitant to place too much emphasis on a figure.

 To argue for a higher Australian population is not to deny the global population pressures we face.

 There are some in this debate who look at the global population crisis, and argue that because it is having a devastating impact on our global environment, we should aim to stem world population growth.

 I agree with that.

 But it does not follow that every nation should be looking at a lower population. That is not a logical extension of the global argument.

 Regional Diversity

 Consider the parallel argument within Australia.

 Different States, different regions and different communities, have different views on development.

 I'll give you an example I encountered in the past fortnight.

 I was having a discussion with Melbourne's interface councils, discussing the recent allocations to them under the Howard Government's Roads to Recovery.

 Unlike most local councils, there was one Council that had a different approach to development.

 They wanted to retain their lifestyle advantages, and wanted the chance to better reflect the local preference for public and community transport over roads works.

 As a result of that, they argued for flexibility within the criteria for Councils to choose to spend a proportion of their local roads allocation on sustainable transport options suited to their local lifestyle preferences.

 I raise this example to point out that not all communities have the same view - and having travelled up and down this country for the past 18 months, I can assure you that the call for policy makers to listen to regional differences is a strong one.

 Here in Sydney, many people feel that local development pressures are placing too much pressure on infrastructure, lifestyle and environment.

 But there are other areas, and you only need to talk to people in Tasmania on this, where people want a larger population.

 My point is simple - we have to develop more flexible means by which we accommodate the range of views - at a State, regional and local level.

 At the Commonwealth level, our responsibility is to ensure that the overall picture meets our national aim of sustainable development, in the context of the changing global reality.

 I am not pretending that this is easy - it clearly is not.

 Office of Population

 That is why Labor will establish, as a matter of priority, a new Office of Population to research and advise on the range of population options and ways of getting there.

 The first step will be to undertake a wide-ranging inquiry to ascertain the levels of population that can be sustained into the long-term in order to pursue more favourable economic, social, and environmental outcomes.

 The Office will play a leadership role in encouraging a wider public understanding of population issues, and an open and honest debate.

 We need an open debate, underpinned by strong leadership, to maintain public confidence on immigration and population issues.

 Labor does not pretend to know what the future holds, but we refuse to face that future blindly. We need to look ahead.

 In the context of planning for our future population challenges, we also accept that the course of events will challenge even our best-laid plans.

 So we have to embed in our long-term planning the flexibility to be able to respond to the changing reality.

 Planning Conclusion

 There are clearly divergent views in this debate.

 Labor's commitment is to be honest about our own views, and recognise that none of us know all of the answers.

 We expect others to do the same.

 But the various players in this debate agree on one thing.

 That is the sense that we are not planning for what's ahead of us as a nation.

 Maybe I am exposed to it more than most - through my portfolio work in areas such as infrastructure, regional development and population.

 But the feeling in the community that we are not planning for our future is widespread. And when you look at the mechanisms we have in place for planning, you'd have to say it is justified.

 The sustainable development of our economies and communities, right across Australia, demands that we progress the population debate in a sensible way.

 That is what Labor's Office of Population will seek to do.

 Thank you.
