 Dear Press,  

 This year marks our ten year anniversary. For ten years weâ€™ve delivered justice for individuals and systemic  change; for Indigenous peoples; for people seeking asylum and refugees; for LGBTI people, women and more. 

 Our work has had a profound impact on the Australian human rights landscape and support from people like you  has been absolutely critical to our success. 

 Today, we launch our End of Financial Year Appeal. 

 We need your help to continue defending human rights in Australia. Against the erosion of democratic freedoms  and protest rights. Against the continued attacks on refugee rights. Against measures that perpetuate Indigenous  inequality and disadvantage and much more. 

 Please stand with us and donate now to support human rights. All donations over $2 are fully tax deductible. 

 Thank you.  

 Hugh de Kretser   Executive Director, Human Rights Law Centre   www.hrlc.org.au/donate
