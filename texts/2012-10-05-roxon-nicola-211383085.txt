 MEDIA RELEASE   

 5 October 2012   

 M47 HIGH COURT DECISION  

 The Government notes the decision of the High Court of Australia handed down  today in the M47 v the Director-General of Security & Ors matter. 

 This case involved a challenge to ASIO in respect of a person who has been  assessed to be a refugee,  but has not been granted a permanent visa as a result of  an ASIO adverse security assessment (ASA), the lawfulness of his ongoing  immigration detention and the lawfulness of any future removal to a safe third  country. 

 The Government takes both national security and its international obligations to  refugees seriously. 

 The judgment confirms that ASIO’s assessment process was procedurally fair but  found a related regulation under the Migration Act to be invalid, requiring the  plaintiff’s application for a protection visa to be reconsidered.  The Court confirmed  that the plaintiff’s detention remains lawful while that process is undertaken. 

 The Government has previously indicated that it would implement a review process  for refugees who remain in immigration detention because of an ASA. 

 The Government is carefully reviewing the reasoning of the High Court to determine  the implications of the decision including for the implementation of that review  process. 

 ASIO only issues ASAs in a small number of cases. They make up less than one per  cent of all Irregular Maritime Arrival visa security assessments undertaken since  January 2010.
