 No: Date:MDC 45 6 SEPTEMBER 1993AUSTRALIAN AID FOR GUATEMALAN RETURNEESAustralia will provide almost $90,000 towards food relief for Guatemalan refugees returning home, the Minister for Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney, said today.*"Guatemala is one of the poorest countries in the world and has one of the worst human rights records," Mr Bilney said."Military and para-military aggression has forced as many as 200,000 people, mostly indigenous people, to flee into the mountains and across the border to Mexico. -"Australia will continue diplomatic efforts to help resolve human rights and other issues."While Australia has a very limited aid role in South America we see this project as an important opportunity to assist the people of Guatemala," Mr Bilney said.The Australian funds will be provided by AIDAB, Australia's overseas aid agency, and directed through Community Aid Abroad.Community Aid Abroad will use the funds to purchase food supplies locally. This will also assist local farming communities.The refugee community will raise funds to cover transport costs and coordinate food distribution.In an effort to become food self-sufficient, the community has planted crops and vegetables and is planning to raise livestock.* Mr Bilney made the announcement during a meeting with 1992 Nobel Peace Prizewinner, Ms Rigoberta Menchu, a Guatemalan Quiche Mayan Indian now living in exile.* * * * * *CANBERRAFor further information contact: Richard Moore (Minister's Office) 06 277 7660 David Jones (AIDAB) 06 276 4967 (Community Aid Abroad) 03 419 7111COMMONWEALTHPARLIAM EI T AH LIB  Y
