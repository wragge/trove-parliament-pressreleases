 Tuesday, August 28, 2001

 Senator John Tierney today announced funding of $361,200 to the Migrant Resource Centre and Hunter Region Inc, to assist migrants, refugees and humanitarian entrants settle quickly and effectively into the local community.

 “Migrants moving into regional areas are often faced with unique hurdles to overcome and support services may be harder to access,” Senator Tierney said.

 “These grants will assist those who come to the Hunter region to settle into the community, contribute their skills and share their unique culture for the benefit of the whole region.”

 The funding is made up of two grants. · $164,600 over 3 years: Provide settlement services through the provision of information, referral, groupwork, direct settlement services, community development and other strategies that facilitate access to mainstream services. The project will also assist with the establishing links to clients living in remote and regional areas. The project will provide culturally appropriate information and referral to new arrivals, humanitarian entrants and longer settled but isolated migrants, especially women, living in the greater Newcastle area and the rural sector of the Hunter Vallet Region · $196,600 over 3 years: To provide settlement services through information, referral, groupwork, direct settlement services, community development and other strategies that facilitate access to mainstream services. The project will also assist service networks to identify gaps and address emerging issues and needs at the national, state and regional levels.

 “The principle objective of settlement services is to contribute to the adjustment by migrants and humanitarian entrants to life in Australia so that they can achieve independence and participate fully in Australian society soon after their arrival,” Senator Tierney said.

 “The Migrant Resource Centre and Hunter Region Inc. will place an important role in this process, by providing their clients with the advice and support which will equip them to enter the broader community confidently and to avail themselves of the opportunities and services available to all Australians.”
