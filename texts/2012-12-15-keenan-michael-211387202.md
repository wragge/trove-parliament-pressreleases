 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling TWO MORE BOATS AS LABOR’S RECORD  YEAR OF FAILURE CONTINUES December 15, 2012

 The illegal arrival of two more boats with over 150 on board continues our worst year of border failure on record, Shadow  Minister for Immigration Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan  said.

 “Labor's failures on our borders have past the point of no return for this Government, as they stand impotent before the  continuing flow of illegal boat traffic to Australia. Only a change of Government can,” Mr Morrison said.

 “As boats continue to arrive illegally every day Labor have no answer and no defence.  A change of Government is the  only hope to get our borders back under control, as every day the problem gets worse and more difficult to fix.

 “Only a Government committed whole heartedly and single mindedly to deterrence can fix Labor's mess. labor have  demonstrated they are just not up to the job and never will be,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “3 boats have arrived in the last 24 hours as Labor remains the big incentive for the people smuggling  trade.

 “The people smugglers continue to collect their million dollar pay cheques, courtesy of Labor’s misguided decision to  abolish the robust border protection system they inherited.

 “The crisis at our borders has seen lives lost, billions of tax payer dollars wasted, an overflowing detention network and  criminals in charge of who comes to our country.

 “In order to take the ‘sugar off the table’ we need an election and a Coalition Government to enforce the strong border  protection policies that wills top the boats from coming,” Mr Keenan said.
