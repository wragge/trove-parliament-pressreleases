 Australian Government Monthly Financial Statements October 2005

 KEY POINTS

 â     The underlying cash balance for the 2005-06 year to 31 October 2005 was a surplus of $7,837 million.

 â     The fiscal balance for the 2005-06 year to 31 October 2005 was a surplus of $14,247 million.

 â     The operating result for the 2005-06 year to 31 October 2005 was a surplus of $14,447 million.

 â     The difference between the fiscal and underlying cash balances is largely attributable to increases in taxation and other receivables and a reduction 

 in education grants payable.

 

 Care needs to be taken when comparing monthly or cumulative data across years and to full year estimates. Revenues and expenses do vary from month-to-month. Factors such as The New Tax System, and the accrual framework including the timing of payments and policy decisions, can have a large impact  on fiscal aggregates from one year to the next and on year-to-date outcomes. Further, the October 2005 monthly financial statements were produced under  the Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (AEIFRS), with the exception that the Department of Defence and the Defence  Materiel Organisation are not yet reporting AEIFRS compliant data for monthly reporting purposes. The move to AEIFRS brings a number of changes  including a new financial statement, the ‘Statement of Changes in Equity’. 

 FISCAL OUTCOMES

 Underlying Cash Balance

 The main components of the underlying cash balance are cash from operations and cash movements in the net investment in non-financial assets. The underlying cash balance for the year to 31 October 2005 was a surplus of $7,837 million. This underlying cash balance is $4,863 million higher than the  October pro-rata (a surplus of $2,974 million) of the 2005-06 Budget estimate of $8,921 million, but is consistent with prior year October balances. The  difference reflects a number of individual variations including the following:

 Movements in underlying cash receipts:

 Higher receipts from:

 â     Dividends due to the receipt of the RBA dividend in August each year; and

 â     Taxation in line with the usual monthly fluctuations in taxation receipts.

 Movements in underlying cash payments: 

 Lower payments for: 

 â     Grants due to: 

 â     primarily, the AusLink and Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements programmes. The level of these payments does not occur equally each 

 month but when State and/or Local Governments make claims for payment;

 â     the delay in commencement of payments to the States under the National Competition Policy and Compensation for GST Revenue Foregone 

 programmes; and

 â     the National Water Commission’s negotiations with funding recipients over the detailed provisions of the funding agreements have not yet 

 been finalised.

 â     Employees due to:

 â     Defence having lower Army numbers, an underspend in Reserve salaries and lower than predicted allowance payments.

 â     Subsidies due to: 

 â     the lower than expected subsidy payments made by the ATO, largely reflecting lower payments under the Energy Grants Credit Scheme.

 â     Foreign aid, specifically, AusAID’s three country and regional programmes (PNG & Pacific; East Asia; and South Asia, Africa and Other) as well as 

 the Emergency, Humanitarian and Refugee Aid and NGO, Volunteer and Community programmes. These payments are not incurred on a pro rata  basis, due to the timing of activities, requirements of partner Governments and organisations, and the unpredictable nature of expenditure on  emergencies:

 Higher payments for:

 â     Personal benefits, due to the Family Tax Benefit Supplement being paid upon lodgement of a recipient’s tax return, which sees proportionally more 

 returns processed between July and November.

 Fiscal Balance

 The fiscal balance for the year to 31 October 2005 was a surplus of $14,247 million. The main components of the fiscal balance are the GFS net operating  balance, which was a surplus of $14,338 million, and a net capital investment of $91 million for the year to 30 October 2005 (refer to the Reconciliation of  the Operating Result to Fiscal Balance on page 9 for further detail).

 FINANCIAL OUTCOMES

 â     Actual expenses are $7,506 million lower when compared with a pro-rata of the Budget estimate. The main reasons for the lower result, provided by 

 function, are due to:

 â     Education function - Lower expenses for education grants. In accordance with the legislation, a large proportion of education grants are expensed 

 between December and February of each year to suit the calendar year operations of these institutions.

 â     Transport Function - Lower expenses mainly attributable to AusLink and other transport programmes as the level of these expenses does not occur 

 equally each month but when State and/or Local Governments make claims for payment.

 â     Defence Function - lower supplier expenses as traditionally a higher proportion of the suppliers budget is used in the second six months of the 

 financial year, reflecting lead times associated with procurement.

 Partially offset by:

 â     Social Security and Welfare Function - Higher expenses as the Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Supplement is paid upon lodgement of a recipient’s tax 

 return. Because tax returns are mostly lodged in the period from July to October in each year, a higher proportion of expenses from the FTB  supplement falls in these months.

 Assets and Liabilities The net asset balance within the General Government sector is a negative net asset position of  $24,644 million at 31 October 2005.

 NOTES:

 The accounting policies in this part are generally consistent with the requirements of AEIFRS. While the scope for financial reporting recommended in AAS  31 is the whole of government (that is, the Australian Government public sector), in accordance with the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998, this  presentation covers the general government sector only. This publication does not include full note disclosures.

 With the introduction of Business Activity Statements and Instalment Activity Statements in 2000-2001, taxpayers provide information on payments  associated with several types of tax when lodging the statement and paying the aggregate net tax amount. Thus, while total tax collections are known with  certainty at the end of each month, the distribution across the relevant heads of revenue cannot be finalised until all statements are received and  processed. The outcomes for some revenue items provided in this statement are thus estimates, in accordance with the best judgement of the Taxation  Commissioner, and subject to revision. The taxation revenue items not affected are: Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, Excise duty, Customs duty, Other  Taxes and Individuals Refunds. The sum of the revenue accrued in the month and the revisions to prior periods equals the revenue reported in the Statement of Revenue and Expenses. All taxation items in these notes are reported on an AEIFRS basis, unless otherwise indicated.

 NOTE 1: INCOME TAX 

 NOTE 2: INDIRECT TAX 

 NOTE 3: GOODS AND SERVICES TAX

 In regard to GST revenue, AAS would suggest the gross amount of GST be included in the Australian Government’s Financial Statements. However, the  clear policy intent of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Australian Government-State Financial Relations is that the GST is a State tax  collected by the Australian Government in an agency capacity. Therefore, accrued GST revenues and associated payments to the States and Territories  are not disclosed in these statements.

 NOTE 4: ADJUSTMENT FOR EDUCATION GRANT EXPENDITURE

 In regard to education grant expenditure, adherence to AAS results in few education expenses being reported until the signing of the Ministerial  determination, which normally occurs between December and February each year. This produces a bunching of expenses such that the full year's expense  is recognised at that time and remains relatively constant until June. The table below provides details of the cash paid by DEST and attributable to the  Education function for the year to date.
