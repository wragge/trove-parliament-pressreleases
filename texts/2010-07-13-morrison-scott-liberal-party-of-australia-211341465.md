 146th boat as Gillard continues 'never  never' policy farce   13/07/10  

 The arrival of the 146th illegal boat under Labor comes as the President of Nauru  made it crystal clear today that he is open to discussions about re-establishing an  asylum seeker processing centre in his country, Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border  Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 “Nauru President Marcus Stephen said today that his government would consider any  request to re-establish a processing centre for asylum seekers but he has yet to get a  call from Julia Gillard,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “The Gillard Government needs to get serious and make immediate contact with the  Nauruan Government to commence discussions about re-opening the Nauru  processing centre or admit that their suggestion for a regional processing centre is  nothing more than a cheap election fix,” he said. 

 “Julia Gillard's never never Timor solution is no option. 

 “Meanwhile figures released today further reveal the true extent of Labor’s failed  immigration and border protection policies. There are now 4,070 people in  immigration detention, the highest detention population on record. This includes 561  children in detention. When the Howard Government left office 21 children were in  immigration detention. 

 “Detention centres are bursting at the seams, motels and mining camps are filling up.  Julia Gillard must implement a solution now or admit her fraud on the Australian  people. 

 “Just like the parliament of East Timor, the Coalition has no confidence in Julia  Gillard's ability to fix the mess she and Labor have created with their failed border  protection announcements,” he said. 

 Mr Keenan said: “A week has passed since the new Prime Minister announced her so-called plan to stop the boats, and the people smugglers have responded with three  more illegal boats with 159 people on board. 

 “People smugglers are organised and sophisticated criminal networks and they  understand the implications of policy changes in Canberra and what impact policy  changes will have on their ability to sell their product. 

 “Clearly, the people smugglers aren’t taking this Prime Minister seriously. 

 “This Prime Minister is proving to be no more effective at stopping the boats than her  predecessor,” he said.
