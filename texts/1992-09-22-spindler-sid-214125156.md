 DEMOCRATS: PROMISE TO CHINESE STUDENTS MUST BE KEPT

 The Democrats have called on the Federal Government to honour the promise  made in 1989 by the then Prime Minister Mr, Hawke to provide refuge for Chinese  people resident in Australia during the 1989 Tlanamen Square Massacre, when he  s a id :

 No PRC national In Australia on 20 June 1989 will be required during the four  years or subeequentiy to return to China against their will unless they have  seriously breached Australian laws.

 "Australia's standing as a nation will be dealt a severe blow if individuals and other  nations should come to the view that a promise made by the representative leader  of the Australian people cannot be trusted."

 Addressing the Federation of Chinese Associations in Melbourne last night  Democrat Spokesperson on Ethnic Affairs Senator Spindler said, 'the Federal  Government must keep the promise, reaffirmed by Mr Keating, that no Chinese 

 students with temporary entry permits or their spouses and dependents would be  forced to return to China.

 "As long as the political situation in China is such that they are at risk there must  be no pressure on them to go back,

 ’The Committee recommendation to disregard the special circumstances is of great  concern and the Government should adopt the views of its own dissenting  members who recommended that permanent residence should be granted to all 

 who can meet certain criteria and temporary permits extended beyond the four  year period if the situation in China remains doubtful.

 "The disappointing majority view of the Committee was supported by both Liberal  and ALP members and this bodes ill for the future of multicutturalism in Australia",  Senator Spindler warned,

 "It follows the despicable legislative intervention in Court proceedings concerning  Cambodian refugees, the Liberal Party's attack on multiculturalism and family  reunion and the Keating Government's budget measure to impose a six month  waiting period for social security benefits on newly arrived migrants.

 “Both Government and Opposition are obviously willing to sacrifice ethnic harmony  for misguided economic interests."
