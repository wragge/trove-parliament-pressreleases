 Salute to Defence personnel June 28, 2012

 In this time of high emotion it is important to remember the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, 

 particularly Navy, who are the first responders to pluck people out of the water from sinking asylum seeker boats.

 Late last week two Armidale-class patrol boats, HMAS Larrakia and HMAS Wollongong were sent to the Indian 

 Ocean north of Christmas Island to rescue survivors and recover bodies from the water after a boat overturned.

 Yesterday HMAS Maitland and HMAS Leeuwin, along with a P3 Orion were deployed when another boat overturned 

 near Christmas Island.

 Shadow Defence Minister David Johnston said all ADF personnel involved were doing an amazing and highly 

 professional job in what are difficult and emotional circumstances for everyone involved.

 Navy personnel had previously been injured and burnt on rescue operations while dealing with the increasing 

 workload due to 336 boats making the perilous journey to Australian waters with 19,429 asylum seekers since 

 November 2007. 

 “We salute their dedication and are grateful for their brave efforts in saving many lives, they are doing an outstanding 

 job,” Senator Johnston said.
