 MEDIA RELEASE  Friday, 23 January 2015  Another broken promise; refugee children still in detention despite Christmas  promise    

 The Australian Greens have slammed the Abbott Government for failing to release  refugee children by Christmas, despite promises to do so.      

 "Despite blackmailing the Senate and using children as hostages to pass their harsh  refugee laws, hundreds of children remain locked up," Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said today.    

 "Hundreds of children are still in immigration detention.    

 "Every day lived in detention is another day of damage inflicted on these children.    

 "The Government held these children as hostages to get the votes they wanted in the  Senate and now they've failed to release them.    

 "The Senators who voted for the harsh new laws in exchange for the release of children  by Christmas must feel pretty conned.    

 "It's clear the Abbott Government can not be trusted. They have no care for the welfare  of these children and no regard for the promises they make to the public or the  Parliament."
