 NEW TENDERING PROCESS FOR ADULT MIGRANT ENGLISH PROGRAM

 The Government has taken the first step to ensure the provision of English language  tuition for migrants is more flexible and cost-effective, the Minister for Immigration and  Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock announced today.

 The public tendering process for the Government's Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP)  will begin tomorrow. The AMEP provides migrants with basic English tuition through State  and Territory service providers.

 "The first advertisements will appear in newspapers tomorrow in Victoria and Western  Australia, seeking expressions of interest from organisations interested in becoming AMEP  service providers.

 "The new tendering process was announced in the August Budget, together with the  Government's commitment to provide an additional S17.6 million funding for AMEP over  four years.

 "Tendering will be introduced in stages over a two-year period, giving time to ensure a  smooth transition to the new arrangements with minimal disruption to clients.

 "Consultations have already been undertaken with language professionals, service  providers, migrants and refugees who use English language programs, the wider community  and State and Territory Governments. Their views will be taken into account when  developing the tender specifications.

 "Only those organisations with a proven record of teaching English to non-English speakers  will be invited to tender.

 "I expect to be able to announce decisions on new arrangements in Victoria and Western  Australia in mid 1997. Victoria and Western Australia are expected to move to the new  arrangements by January 1998, followed by the remaining States/Territories in July 1998,"  Mr Ruddock said.

 "Migrants who have functional English have a better chance of successfully settling in  Australia and of finding a job. The Government is committed to ensuring migrants have the  opportunity to gain this essential means of communication in their initial period in Australia."

 Further industry briefings and consultations are scheduled for Perth on 2-3 December and  for Melbourne on 5-6 December.
