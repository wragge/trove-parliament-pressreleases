 28-07-2016 -

 This statement provides an update on Operation Sovereign Borders (OSB) activities related to the off-water reception and processing of illegal maritime arrivals.

 The reporting period is from 1 June 2016 to 30 June 2016.

 During this reporting period there were no illegal maritime arrivals transferred to Australian Immigration authorities.

 No illegal maritime arrivals were transferred to regional processing countries.

 The Australian Government worked with the Government of Vietnam to return 21 people who did not engage Australia's protection obligations.

 In May the Australian Government also worked with the Government of Sri Lanka to return 12 people who did not engage Australia's protection obligations.  This is in addition to the return of passengers and crew from the vessel reported in the May 2016 monthly update.  The May 2016 statement has been updated to reflect this information. 

 Five illegal maritime arrival detainees were voluntarily removed from Australia. Two illegal maritime arrival detainees were involuntarily removed from Australia to their country of origin. Their removal from Australia is consistent with Australia's obligations.

 Three illegal maritime arrival transferees voluntarily returned to their country of origin from a regional processing country.

 As at 30 June 2016, there were a total of 854 people in Manus Island Regional Processing Centre (RPC) and 442 people in Nauru RPC. With the opening of the Manus RPC, those yet to be determined are now permitted to depart the RPC. The figure on those still living in the RPC will therefore be fluid.

 Of the 1,014 Refugee Status Initial Assessment Notifications at Manus Island, 512 were positive and 502 were negative as at 30 June 2016. There were 543 refugees who have been given a positive final determination. 

 Of the 1,196 Current Refugee Status Determination (RSD) hand downs in Nauru, 921 were positive and 275 were negative as at 30 June 2016.
