 The Hon Peter Dutton MP  Minister for Immigration and Border Protection   

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 12 April 2016    

 A REALITY CHECK FOR RICHARD MARLES  

 Bill Shorten’s Labor has clearly learned nothing from the six years of chaos and  criminality at Australia’s sea borders over its time in Government from 2007 to 2013. 

 The entire period was a shameful litany of failures presided over by an irresponsible  Government and a ministerial master-class of incompetence.   

 This is the reality Richard Marles seeks to gloss over every time he dares to venture a  comment on immigration and border protection matters. 

 Six years of border chaos 

 50,000 + illegal arrivals 

 1200 + dead at sea 

 800 + illegal boats 

 This is the pedigree of Mr Marles’ predecessors - Australians should consider where Mr  Marles would feature should Labor ever return to Government. 

 Chris Evans  163 illegal boats  7,418 illegal maritime arrivals 

 Chris Bowen  398 illegal boats  24,447 illegal maritime arrivals 

 Brendan O’Connor 183 illegal boats  12,386 illegal maritime arrivals 

 Tony Burke   68 illegal boats  5,358 illegal maritime arrivals 

 In stark contrast the Coalition has stopped boats, stopped deaths at sea and closed   detention centres. 

 It is now more than 600 days since there has been a successful people smuggling  venture.

 At the height of Labor’s border failures there were more than 10,000 people in detention  including 2,000 children. More than 8,000 children were placed in detention in the Labor  years.  

 Today there are no Illegal Maritime Arrival (IMA) children in detention and only around  1,800 adults of whom only 570 are IMAs. 

 The bulk of people in detention today are foreigners who have committed serious  crimes in Australia and have had their visas revoked as we remove them from our  country. 

 Mr Marles complains that the average time in detention is rising. The reason is simple -  there are no new IMAs flooding in on people smugglers’ boats to bring the average  down. Illegal arrivals peaked at 3,000 a month under Labor. 

 The situation we face is Labor’s mess - Labor’s mess alone.  The Coalition Government  is cleaning it up.  

 Unfortunately for Australia it will take years, unfortunately for Australian taxpayers it will  have cost billions - that is Labor’s irresponsible legacy in just this one portfolio alone. 

 Mr Marles also shows today that he clearly is not across his brief - a continuation of  incompetence so clearly displayed by his predecessors. 

 If he were, he would understand that funds earmarked for refugee resettlement in  Cambodia are paid to the International Organization for Migration on a fee-for-service  basis, only $2 million of $15 million has been expended.
