 Media Release: Dutton must guarantee health services for Manus Island 

 March 4, 2017 

 Immigration Minister Peter Dutton must immediately clarify the status of medical care  available to people seeking asylum on Manus Island. 

 "We are hearing that there are no doctors working today in the detention centres on PNG  due to International Health and Medical Service failing to properly register its medical  practitioners with the Papua New Guinean government," Greens Immigration spokesperson  Senator Nick McKim said. 

 "If this is true, Mr Dutton must take urgent action to ensure proper medical care is available  to people who remain Australia's responsibility."  

 "Given the ongoing mental and physical harm Australia is causing to detainees, it is  absolutely essential that they have access to proper medical support." 

 "It is now 11 months since the Manus Island detention centre was declared illegal, and in  that time Peter Dutton has sat on his hands while conditions for asylum seekers and  refugees have continued to deteriorate." 

 "The only long term solution is to close the camps and bring the people in them to  Australia."
