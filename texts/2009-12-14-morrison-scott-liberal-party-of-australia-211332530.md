 RUDD MUST RULE OUT TRANSFERRING DETAINEES FROM CHRISTMAS  ISLAND TO MAINLAND 

 Mr Scott Morrison MP  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today Kevin Rudd must rule out transferring 

 detainees from Christmas Island to the Australian mainland if he is serious about preserving any last shred of the 

 strong border protection regime he inherited from the Coalition Government.  

 “The Christmas Island detention centre is full to overflowing because of the failed border protection policies and 

 decisions of the Rudd Government,” Mr Morrison said.  

 “In Opposition, Labor described the Christmas Island facility as a ‘white elephant’. Under Labor’s failed border 

 protection polices, Christmas Island has become a tent city for illegal boat arrivals,” he said.  

 “62 boats and more than 2,700 people have illegally arrived since Labor took the decision to roll back Australia’s 

 border protection regime.  

 “If the Government now provides passage to the mainland at say, Darwin, to process onshore the people who 

 have illegally arrived in Australian waters before their asylum claims have been tested, this will be the final nail in 

 the coffin for the strong border protection regime Kevin Rudd inherited from John Howard.  

 “It is not enough to simply undertake the health, security and identity checks before allowing people who have 

 arrived illegally in Australia by boat onto the Australian mainland. Their asylum claims must be tested first. This is 

 the only way to protect the integrity of our borders and the fairness of our refugee programme.  

 “The only reason Labor would seek to transfer detainees to Darwin is to relieve the pressure built up on 

 Christmas Island caused by the failure of their own policies. Transferring people to onshore processing will take 

 our system from bad to worse under Labor.  

 “The excision zone established by the Howard Government protected Australia from having our processes 

 abused by those who sought to gain an unfair advantage over other legitimate asylum seekers, in equally and 

 even more desperate situations around the world.  

 “The transfer of detainees to the mainland for onshore processing would represent another major victory for the 

 people smugglers. Once again, under the Rudd Government it will be the people smugglers who are determining 

 who comes to our country and the circumstances in which they come.  

 “Australia runs a generous refugee programme. It is something we should all feel very proud of. It is imperative 

 that it remains a fair system. Our system must seek to help those most in need, as opposed to those most able to 

 take advantage. That’s what a fair go is all about,” Mr Morrison said.
