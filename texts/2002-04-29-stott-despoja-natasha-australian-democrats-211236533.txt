 AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRAT SPEECHES

 Senator Natasha Stott Despoja Portfolio: Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

 Dated: 29 Apr 2002

 Location: Perth - Central Metropolitan TAFE

 Senator Stott Despoja speech: 25 Years of the Politics of Refugees

 I acknowledge the traditional owners of the land.

 Knowing that it is exactly 25 years since that first public meeting to form a new Party, was held here in Perth, it is almost spooky. It is like the ghost of Charles Court is going to appear and say, as he did 25 years ago, “You’ll fail”

 Well the Democrats did not fail. From the beginning the Democrats were different in terms of our policies but also the way we practice politics.

 Don Chipp’s catch-cry at these first public meetings was “honesty, tolerance and compassion”.

 Many of the issues that were important in 1977 remain at the forefront of the Democrats’ agenda including environmental protection, honesty and accountability in Government, and a commitment to social justice.

 At the Democrats 1977 federal election campaign launch, Chipp said “We will show compassion and give all possible assistance to refugees.”

 At that election, the Australian Democrats entered the Federal Parliament and have not been absent since. It was a rapid rise for a Party that has continued as the third force in Australian politics for 25 years.

 For twenty-five years the Australian Democrats have adhered to our core principles of social justice and human rights.

 The first policy on Population, Immigration and Ethnic Affairs stated: “The plight of refugees of all kinds will be regarded as quite a different matter to any migration plan, and will be given compassionate consideration, responding to and working with the activities of the United Nations.”

 From 1984 there has never been fewer than seven Democrats in the Federal Parliament, ensuring party status. That year, Chipp warned of an anti refugee feeling arising in Australia and actively encouraged by the Coalition. He told the Parliament that unless the immigration debate was carried out with moderation and respect for all points of view “Australia will become an ugly place to live in.”

 In 1988, when then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, made remarks that Australia should cut back Asian immigration, he was attacked by the Democrats who were - and are - committed to a non discriminatory immigration programme and expanding the refugee programme.

 Over the years, the Democrats have advocated immigration levels that are sustainable in an environmentally fragile land, but have also consistently argued for greater emphasis on increasing refugee intake.

 In 1992 the ALP introduced mandatory detention, the limiting of judicial review and the restricting of the rights of asylum seekers to apply for protection. All passed with the enthusiastic support of the Coalition.

 Over the last ten years we have continued to campaign against mandatory detention, temporary protection visas, and restrictions on the rights of refugees to appeal decisions, receive legal advice or access services such as English classes.

 In 1997 Senator Bartlett entered Parliament and in the next year spoke more than 100 times in the Senate on the topic of refugees: moving amendments, opposing legislation, seeking to have regulations disallowed and advocating on behalf of refugees in Australia. On behalf of the Democrats he has built on the work of many members and Senators that came before, assisting individual asylum seeker cases and working in the Parliament to oppose the restrictions on the rights of refugees that have escalated over the last 5 years.

 This Government has introduced vague notions like “bad character” as grounds for deportation and “Ministerial discretion” as well as more tangible barriers such as fees for refugees, and temporary protection visas for unauthorised arrivals.

 In April 1999 the Democrats expressed concern at the introduction of safe haven visas for Kosovar refugees on the grounds that this would open the way for temporary visas for all unauthorised refugees. It did. They were introduced in November that year.

 In 1999 the Coalition, with ALP support, introduced temporary visas for refugees, despite the fact that this policy was broadly condemned when proposed by One Nation before the 1998 election.

 The bureaucratic and emotional time bomb of Temporary Visas is rapidly ticking down. There are uncertain futures for genuine refugees who have lived in the Australian community for the last few years.

 The Democrats instigated the Senate Inquiry into the operation of Australia’s refugee and humanitarian program in 2000, which among other matters examined the forced deportation of a woman to China who was more than 8 months pregnant.. There was also a Report on Immigration Detention Centres, which revealed much about the treatment of asylum seekers.

 The Democrats broadened the scope of the current Select Committee Inquiry into a Certain Maritime Incident to investigate not only allegations made in 2001 by the Federal Government regarding children overboard, but also the detail of the expensive and inhumane Pacific Solution.

 The Democrats were among the first to publicly raise doubt about the Government’s story about children being thrown overboard and we were condemned by many commentators in the Parliament and the media. When Government claims proved to be untrue, broadcaster John Laws for one, offered a public apology.

 We will continue to shine the spotlight on the flaws in the policy approach of Liberal and Labor and act in the interests of the powerless people who are refugees.

 At the beginning of this year Andrew Bartlett and I visited Woomera at the request of detainees to meet with them and report on conditions at the centre, their despair and their desire to have the Australian people hear their stories.

 The events at Curtin detention centre we have seen evidence of, over the last few days have again pointed to the need for a different approach to asylum seekers.

 The Government’s insistence on locking up all unauthorised arrivals for prolonged periods of time is causing immense and unnecessary suffering to people who have often already endured an enormous amount.

 Last year was the 50th anniversary of the UN Refugee Convention. How did we mark it in Australia? Did the Government produce glossy posters and pamphlets? Did the Coalition restate their commitment to the Convention or to refugee protection?

 Did the Immigration Minister decide we would invest in English classes or housing or health services for asylum seekers and refugees to help them settle in as the latest contribution to our tolerant, peaceful and multicultural society?

 Did Minister Ruddock end the uncertainty for those genuine refugees who are on Temporary Protection Visas?

 Or did the Prime Minister send armed troops to forcibly turn asylum seekers away from our waters?

 In 2001, the battle over the rights of refugees escalated. The Australian Democrats fought a largely lonely campaign in the Australian Senate, opposing migration bills to remove Australian territory from the migration zone, restrict access to the Courts and the media, introduce strip searches of asylum seekers in detention and implement the policy of physically forcing refugees to turn away from Australian waters.

 Unfortunately, we have not been able to prevent the ever-increasing swing towards restricting the rights

 of refugees, but we are able to give a voice to the many - and growing - numbers of Australians who believe that the Government’s approach is unworkable, expensive and inhumane.

 The Inquiry into a certain Maritime Incident has revealed that it has cost about three times more to process asylum seekers under the Pacific solution than those processed on the Australian mainland. Australia is spending an extra $114 million just on housing and processing those detainees . We could use that money so much more wisely.

 In the most recent Parliamentary sittings again contentious migration legislation that gives unprecedented powers to the Immigration Department, was rushed through with ALP support.

 In our 25th year, the Democrats continue to support a non-discriminatory immigration program that gives priority to humanitarian cases, refugees and family reunion, we oppose Temporary Protection Visas and mandatory detention. We oppose the Border Protection Bills to repel asylum seekers on the high seas and the so-called Pacific Solution.

 The Democrats continue to believe Australia has a moral responsibility to provide haven for genuine refugees and not send people back to persecution or death.

 We believe that welcoming and supporting refugees will bring long term, medium term and short term, benefits to the Australian community. And we know many other Australians believe the same thing.

 We are very pleased to host this forum tonight and honoured to have Sister Veronica Brady as the guest speaker.

 This is the second address in the speakers series which the Democrats are holding for our 25th year. The first topic was “25 years of nuclear-free politics” given by Peter Garrett, President of the Australian Conservation Foundation.

 Tonight the topic is “25 years of the politics of refugees”.

 Our speaker may not be as physically tall as Peter Garrett but similarly, also she has “the power and the passion”.

 Veronica Brady is a Roman Catholic nun, a member of the Loreto Order .

 Veronica was recently a recipient of a Rockefeller Fellowship at the University of Oregon in the USA to work on Ecology and the Sacred .

 She has published widely on Australian literature, culture and religion and as many of you know, has an abiding concern for matters of social justice , and in particular reconciliation with our indigenous peoples.

 Her most recent books are a collection of essays, CAUGHT IN THE DRAUGHT, a study of attitudes to Aboriginal Australians, CAN THESE BONES LIVE? and a biography of Judith Wright, SOUTH OF MY DAYS.

 She has served the community in a number of positions, from membership of the Boards of the ABC, to the Library and Information Services of WA, Outcare, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and she was West Australian Chairperson of the Older Australians' Advisory Committee.

 She has taught for many years in the Department of English in the University of Western Australia where, since her so-called retirement, she is now an Honorary Senior Research Fellow. We are very pleased and honoured to have her speak tonight.

 It is an appropriate way to honour our founding fathers and mothers. Happy Birthday Democrats and please welcome Sister Veronica Brady.
