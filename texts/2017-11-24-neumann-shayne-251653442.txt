 SHAYNE NEUMANN MP 

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR   

 TURNBULL MUST ENSURE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF MEN IN PNG   

 Malcolm Turnbull must ensure the ongoing safety and security of asylum seekers and  refugees in PNG following their transfer from the closed Manus Island Regional  Processing Centre to alternative accommodation.   

 Of deep concern have been the reports of the use of force to remove asylum seekers  and refugees against their will. This would never have occurred if Malcolm Turnbull and  Peter Dutton had managed this situation properly from the outset.    

 The 24 day standoff at the closed Manus Island RPC is a situation that could have been  avoided if the Turnbull Government didn’t wait until the last minute to finalise ongoing  arrangements in PNG.   

 Malcolm Turnbull and Peter Dutton have failed to manage Australia’s offshore  processing arrangements - including failing to be upfront from the start about access to  e 

 ssential services at alternative accommodation for asylum seekers and refugees.   

 Turnbull has a moral obligation to ensure refugees have access to essential services at  the alternative accommodation including food, water, security, health and welfare  services.   

 This out-of-touch Prime Minister can no longer continue to shirk his responsibility; he  must immediately negotiate third country resettlement options for eligible refugees.   

 Labor’s asylum seeker policy is clear. We will never let the people smugglers back in  business and Australia is not, and must not be, a resettlement option.   

 Turnbull must immediately accept New Zealand’s offer to resettle refugees from Manus  Island and Nauru and negotiate conditions similar to the United States refugee  resettlement agreement to ensure people smugglers do not exploit vulnerable people.
