 Aid for United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees programs

 Australia will contribute $745,000 to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  (UNHCR) programs In Thailand, Sri Lanka and Turkey, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and  Trade. Senator Gareth Evans announced today.

 "The UNHCR Is an Important agency providing protection and assistance to an estimated 14  million refugees worldwide," Senator Evans said.

 Australia will provide $220,000 to support the UNHCR's Anti-piracy Program In Thailand,  bringing Australia's contribution to the program since its inception In 1982 to over $2 million.

 "This program is an Important component of our overall assistance to Indo Chinese refugees. It  has led to a marked reduction In the number of attacks on boat people and an encouraging  increase in the number of successful prosecutions of offenders," Senator Evans said.

 The UNHCR's program for the Determination of Status of Laotians in Thailand will re ceive  $125,000.

 "Australia's support for this program is consistent with our emphasis on non-resettlement  solutions for the majority of asylum seekers in the South East Asia and Indo China regions,"  Senator Evans said.

 In Sri Lanka, the UNHCR Special Program of Limited Assistance to Returnees directed at the  resettlement of Tamils who are returning from India, will receive $100,000.

 In response to an urgent UNHCR appeal for housing an estimated 37,000 Iraqi Kurdish refugees  in Turkey, Australia will contribute $100,000.

 Australia will also provide $75,000 to finance the technical assessment of projects aimed at  linking traditional refugee assistance with development programs.

 'This approach is consistent with Australia's basic policy approach of finding durable  solutions for refugees," Senator Evans said.

 Australia will also make available $125,000 to assist the UNHCR with organising two  International conferences on refugees, the first on Central American refugees will be held in  Guatemala on 29-31 May and the second on Indo Chinese refugees will be held in Geneva on  13-14 June.

 Australian emergency assistance to UNHCR forms part of the Government’s overseas aid  program administered by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau  (AIDAB).
