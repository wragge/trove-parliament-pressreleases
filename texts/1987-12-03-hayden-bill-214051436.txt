 More food aid for Afghan refugees in Pakistan

 Australia would provide emergency food aid valued at $4.114 million  through the World Food Program (WFP)/ UN High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR) operation for Aghan refugees in Pakistan, the Acting  Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, announced  today.

 The emergency food aid, consisting of 20 000 tonnes of Australian wheat  including freight, is expected to reach Pakistan by mid-February 1988.

 Senator Evans said the number and needs of the Afghan refugees in Pakistan  had not altered much during the past year. The current Afghan refugee  population in Pakistan is estimated at 2.9 million.

 Australia has been contributing emergency food aid for the WFP/UNHCR  Afghan refugee feeding program in Pakistan for the past eight years. The  program forms part of the Government's humanitarian aid program managed  by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).
