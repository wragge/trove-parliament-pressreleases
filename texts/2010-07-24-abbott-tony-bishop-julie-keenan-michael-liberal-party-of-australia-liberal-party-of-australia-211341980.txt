 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, it’s nice to be here again in Perth. It’s great to be at the West Australian Liberal Council. I am pleased  to have had the opportunity today to announce a $50 million addition that will give us a National Crime  Prevention Program. This effectively restores what was a $65 million program established by the Howard  Government in 2004, to do a range of community crime prevention initiatives. I’ve seen these myself. I  visited a close-circuit TV measure that was put in place with that Howard Government money in outer  metropolitan Melbourne along with Tony Smith recently. I sat in the local police station control room. I saw  how this CCTV system enabled them to monitor their streets, which obviously provides a big advantage if  we are going to cut down on the kind of petty crime, the kind of street crime which is such a problem for  local communities, and which is so important in giving local people that tragic sense that they’re not safe in  their own community.    

 So this is an important community initiative. It’s the kind of initiative which sensible governments take in  order to deal with real problems in local communities. Now, Michael Keenan is the Shadow Minister. He’s  the Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs. This is one of his initiatives and I might ask him to say a few  words.   

 MICHAEL KEENAN:   

 Well, when you’re out in any community in Australia, you’ll hear feedback about how people value their  sense of safety on our streets. They value their sense of safety in their homes. And we’re looking at ways  that we can find for the federal government to help enhance that community safety. Yesterday with the  Leader and with the Premier we were down announcing how we were going to make sure that we were  doing our bit on our borders, to make sure that illegal drugs, weapons and other contraband didn’t hit our  streets. Today we’re announcing $50 million so we can find worthwhile local projects, in conjunction with  local police, for ways that will secure our community better.

 That is funding of closed-circuit television cameras, local shops, local crime hotspots. It’s funding anti-graffiti programs to make sure that we don’t get that sense of lawlessness on our streets as people move  around, with graffiti and vandalism. It’s funding ways that we can get our local councils to do things. In my  own seat of Stirling the local council runs a fantastic community safe suburbs program that involves patrol  cars, it involves anti-graffiti, and it’s the sort of thing that gives people confidence when they leave their  homes, it gives people confidence on the streets and it does the sorts of things, using the heft of the  Commonwealth government, to address what is this very important local issue.    

 So we’re very pleased to announce this extra $50 million of funding and we hope it will go a long way to  helping secure our streets.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Ok, just if I may, just a few comments about wider issues. I notice today that the Government has announced  a cash for clunkers program. I’m happy to have a look at it, and to consider the usefulness or otherwise of  such a program. But I should point out that just last year the Industry Minister, Senator Carr, dismissed these  programs as wasteful, complicated and an unnecessary use of finite resources. So, certainly in bringing this  program in, the Government seems to have humiliated the Industry Minister who was dead against these  programs when they were first mooted last year.    

 Just on the general issue of leadership. Look, what the Prime Minister did yesterday was demonstrate that  she is not fit to lead this country. This idea that something as important as climate change should be decided  not by the Parliament, but by some kind of Citizens’ Assembly, is either a complete abdication of leadership  or it is a camouflage for the coming carbon tax. Now, she can’t have it both ways. She’s got to decide  whether she wants to be a strong leader, an effective Prime Minister or some kind of debate moderator and I  think what the Australian public want from Julia Gillard is signs that she can be a leader, not just someone  who fudges the hard issues before an election, can’t decide the hard issues before the election and wants to  send them off to a kind of giant focus group.    

 On one other issue, the issue of boat people, I’ve noticed reports in some of the papers that there is some  kind of small armada of boats coming our way. I can’t comment on the facts that are alleged in those reports.  I can say, though, that this indicates that it is pull factors uniquely associated with this Government that  seems to be attracting the boats. The people smugglers know that under this Government Australia has been  a soft touch and they fear that if the government changes, their business will be shut down. Well, I have a  message for the people smugglers: they will be shut down when there is a change of government.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, why don’t women voters like you?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I don’t accept the proposition. I say that my job is to appeal to all Australians and I think that what’s  important here is competence, not gender. And what I offer to the Australian public is a competent  government, and I think that’s what we need, we need a competent government and I might ask Julie  Bishop, my Deputy, just to say a few words.   

 JULIE BISHOP:   

 Women across Australia want to see stability and certainty and competence in the government. And whether  a government is led by a male or a female, they want to see that stability and certainty and competence.  They do not have that in this Government. Tony Abbott can provide the stability, the certainty, the  competence that women across Australia want in their government. He won’t waste taxpayers’ money. He 

  3 

 won’t drive up taxes that harms our economy and he’s concerned about the cost of living pressures that  families across Australia are suffering from under this Government. I’ve worked with Tony Abbott for 12  years. I’ve had one of the most satisfying professional relationships with Tony Abbott. He’s a great person  to work with. I think he’s a wonderful man. He’s got a beautiful wife, three beautiful daughters, he’s grown  up with three sisters and if anybody understands women’s issues in the leadership across Australia, it’s Tony  Abbott.    

 QUESTION:   

 Why are you going to such pains to stress that today? I mean, we haven’t seen Julie Bishop here in all our  time in Perth. This is the first time your wife has appeared on the campaign. It’s obviously a sensitive issue  for you, isn’t it?   

 JULIE BISHOP:   

 No, that’s not correct. I can say that I’ve been travelling around Queensland and Victoria and if it’s the first  time you’ve seen me in Western Australia since yesterday, I only arrived last night.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, you and Julie Bishop both were at pains in your speech today to point out the connections that  you’ve just been making. Why have you decided to do that today, and are you concerned about the poll  which puts the female vote lower for you?   

 JULIE BISHOP:   

 I have been saying this about Tony Abbott for six months. If the media haven’t been reporting my speeches,  I’m happy to send them, but I’ve been saying this about Tony for six months.   

 QUESTION:   

 It did seem quite blatant though, today. It wasn’t a deliberate insert into the speeches today?   

 JULIE BISHOP:   

 No, I’ve said it, I’ve said it every speech I’ve given about Tony for the last six months.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 And, look, you know, Margie my wife is a busy professional woman -   

 QUESTION:   

 I’m not necessarily talking about her.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 She’s a busy professional woman, she runs a community-based child care centre, she can’t just up sticks and  leave just because an election campaign has been called.   

 QUESTION:   

 So today’s appearance was a coincidence?   

  4 

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It was, she needed to organise well in advance to get on to the campaign trail. We only knew, I suppose, a  week ago that the election was going to be called, and this is the earliest she could come on to the campaign  trail. I am so thrilled to have her.  I’ve got to say she does have a real job, she does have a child care centre  that needs to be looked after, that needs to be supervised and managed. If she can give me a few days  between now and polling day I’ll be extremely grateful.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, the local opinion polls have you trailing in Canning and Hasluck, two seats that you obviously  hope to win. What can you do to turn it round?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, I think that we just focus on the consequences of re-electing the Government. Now, the consequences  of re-electing the Government will be dire, absolutely dire. We will be moving forward to more backflips,  more spending, more taxes, more boats and I don’t think any one wants that. I think the public understand  that if you want to end the waste, stop the boats, stop the new taxes, pay back the debt, there’s got to be a  change of government. Now, if we keep letting the public know the consequences of re-electing Julia Gillard  versus the consequences of electing Tony Abbott, I think this is a very winnable election.   

 QUESTION:   

 What do you offer West Australian voters?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, the greatest threat to Western Australia, as Twiggy Forrest and others have made abundantly clear, is  Labor’s great big new tax on mining and the dishonesty, the absolute dishonesty, with which the Prime  Minister has approached this whole issue, and the dishonesty with which the Labor Party has dealt with this  issue. Now, this tax is a great big cudgel that will blow the brains out of the West Australian economy if it  goes ahead and we are determined to stop it. We are the last line of defence between the West Australian  economy, West Australian living standards, and this great big new tax that will clobber them.   

 QUESTION:   

 In your opening remarks, you said that Julia Gillard had humiliated Kim Carr in her announcement today.  Joe Hockey has publicly stated in the past in his speeches that he’s worried about the proliferation of CCTV  cameras. Have you humiliated him today?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, this was a, what we are essentially doing is renewing a programme of the Howard Government that  had most of its money removed by the current Government. This was a $65 million programme under the  Howard Government. The Rudd-Gillard Government has turned it into a $15 million programme. We’ll turn  it back into a decent program with the $50 million that I’ve announced today.   

 QUESTION:   

 [inaudible]…and it’s not just today. There has been further polling indicating that Julia Gillard is more in  touch with families than you, which is interesting given that you are married with three children. We’ve seen  Julia Gillard’s parents out in force during this campaign. Where are your daughters? Can we expect to see  any more of them? Are they on your side? And also, can I ask you about any prep for the debate tomorrow?

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, look, you know, my daughters are young, independent women. They’re 21, 19 and 17. One of them is  doing the HSC this year. Another is travelling in Indonesia, but will be back in Australia soon enough,  certainly, she tells me, before polling day. My eldest daughter is a student at the University of Technology  and she tells me that she’s looking forward to the debate tomorrow night. And she’s looking forward, where  her schedule permits, to coming onto the campaign trail. I mean, I am very blessed with a supportive family,  but all of my family members have their own lives, and the last thing I would want to do is try to intrude my  life on theirs, to the extent that they’re doing their own thing. That’s the way it ought to be. Just because I’m  in an election campaign, just because I’m in the fight of my life, doesn’t mean that I should take them away  from the struggles of their life.   

 QUESTION:   

 And the debate?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, look, obviously I’ve been thinking about it. Certainly, I know that the worm dislikes Liberals, the  worm has always hated Liberals, and I suspect that the worm is not going to change its character. So, look,  I’m expecting to see a pretty unenthusiastic worm tomorrow night. But I know that I have good arguments  on my side. I know that this has been a bad Government, an incompetent Government that doesn’t deserve  to be re-elected, and I’ll be prosecuting that case tomorrow.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott you said yesterday that you would be the next Prime Minister of Australia, you told voters that,  and yet the polls published today show anything but. Are you overconfident?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, I think what I said yesterday was that if we win the seat of Hasluck I will be the next Prime Minister  of Australia, and certainly we do need to win those marginal seats. But again, I am focusing on the field  evidence. I am focusing on the fact that this has been a monumentally incompetent Government, a  Government that lacks both competence and conviction, as today’s, as yesterday’s extraordinary  announcement from the Prime Minister revealed. I mean, let’s just focus on the fact that this is a Prime  Minister who said of climate change that ‘delay is denial,’ who said of climate change ‘if you can’t manage  climate, you can’t manage the future,’ and what does the Prime Minister do? She subcontracts out what is  surely just about the biggest decision any government can make to a group of, to an unelected focus group. I  mean, this is a complete failure of leadership or it is a deceptive, dishonest, sneaky camouflage for the  coming carbon tax. And look, I don’t think that the Prime Minister is necessarily weak. I do know, I do  know that she’s always wanted a carbon price, that Bob Brown has always wanted a carbon tax, that the  Greens will have the balance of power in the Senate, if the Government is re-elected courtesy of the secret  preference deal. That’s why I say as sure as night follows day if this Government is re-elected there will be a  carbon tax. Thank you.
