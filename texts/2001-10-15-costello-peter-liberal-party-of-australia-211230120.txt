 SUBJECTS: Labor stooges/refugee policy, Labor ads, Cheryl Kernot, Gary Hardgrave leadership

 JOURNALIST:

 How do you feel the election campaign is going so far?

 TREASURER:

 Oh look I think it is going to be a tight election campaign, either side could win this election campaign. It won't be over for another four weeks and we are campaigning hard and we are not taking anything for granted and we think that Australians are going to have a clear choice at the next election between one side of politics which has a unified team and can make the right calls for Australia. The other side of politics which has a very weak team and is internally divided. Now you had an example of this just at the shopping centre. Mr Beazley goes on national television, he says he supports the Government's refugee policy. The Young Labor is sent down to this shopping centre to attack the Government 's refugee policy. If we hadn't been able to identify that they were the Young Labor, they would have been down there attacking the Government's refugee policy. It was only because one of them was recognised as being a Labor candidate for Surfers Paradise that we find out that the Labor Party has people down in shopping centres attacking the Government's refugee policy whilst Mr Beazley says he supports it.  This is what we 've always said about the Labor Party, you can't believe where they stand on these things. They say one thing, but they intend to do a completely different thing.

 JOURNALIST:

 How do you feel about your smile being used in ALP election ads?

 TREASURER:

 I'm, nobody likes personal campaigns and personal abuse in TV advertisements. But the campaign has fallen flat and they are obviously not going to continue with that campaign. If they want to continue with it, they are welcome to waste their money on it, but it has been unsuccessful.

 JOURNALIST:

 At the same time there was the flip-flop campaign against Kim Beazley, I mean that was perceived as being derogatory to his appearance.

 TREASURER:

 No, I don't think anybody in the Liberal Party runs around talking about Mr Beazley's appearance, do they? We don't make fun of his physical characteristics. But with the Labor Party as I said, if they want to continue with that advertising campaign until election day, they 'll waste their money on it. So they are perfectly welcome to do it, but they 've pulled it

 already, as I understand it because it wasn 't successful. And I don't think the politics of personalities will be successful in Australia.

  

 JOURNALIST:

 If that's the case, do you think they 're being a bit harsh on Cheryl Kernot?

 TREASURER:

 I think what has happened this week in relation to Cheryl Kernot if you recall, is she tried to smear Peter Dutton, the Liberal candidate for Dickson.

 JOURNALIST:

 So the Liberal's are getting her back then?

 TREASURER:

 No, the Liberal's would like Cheryl Kernot to fully apologise for attempting to smear a man on the basis that he had left the drug squad under a cloud. And particularly we would like her to fully apologise because she was trying to make the point that she 's against personal abuse. And in the midst of making this point against personal abuse she engages in one of the worst smears that I have seen in Australian politics. She tries to smear a policeman about his police record. That 's how Mrs Kernot managed to get herself in the news headlines and I think she still owes Mr Dutton a full, unqualified apology. If she is against the politics of personal smear, I think she ought to call a press conference and unreservedly apologise to him.

 JOURNALIST:

 So she's, anything the Liberals want to shove at her, she 's brought it on herself?

 TREASURER:

 Sorry.

 JOURNALIST:

 Anything that Liberals want to throw at Mrs Kernot, she 's brought it on herself?

 TREASURER:

 I don't think the Liberals are throwing anything at Mrs Kernot, Mrs Kernot tried to smear Peter Dutton by suggesting that he had resigned from the Queensland police force under a cloud. That was false, absolutely without foundation. Absolutely without foundation. You've got to ask yourself,

 what kind of a person does that. I haven 't seen anything like that in Australian politics for decades.

 JOURNALIST:

  

 Is it in anyway disappointing for you that after the Liberal Party 's result in the State election you don't have more people campaigning around you? I mean today you are doing a walk with the Federal MP and the local Councillor, but not a State MP to be seen.

 TREASURER:

 Well, obviously we would like more Members in the State Parliament. I can't pretend otherwise, of course we would like more Members in the State Parliament, but this is a Federal election and I am here with my friend Gary Hardgraves, who is running for election and I 'm walking around because I am supporting him and he's the candidate for the next four weeks. And I think he has done a pretty good job and from numbers of the people that I met today, they think very highly of Gary Hardgrave. And they think he has been a good Member and so do I. It 's a great pleasure to be here with him. Gary is worth 20 of others.

 JOURNALIST:

 If John Howard ever (inaudible) would you be taking over as Prime Minister?

 TREASURER:

 Well, I am running for election in my own seat and also as Treasurer. I 've made that entirely clear and that is all I 'm focussed on, seeing Australia through the difficult economic circumstances that we are now in.

 Thanks
