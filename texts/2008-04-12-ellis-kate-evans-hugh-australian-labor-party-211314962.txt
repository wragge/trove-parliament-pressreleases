 Australia 2020 Youth Summit  CommuniquÃ©    

 Introduction   

 This CommuniquÃ© captures the ideas and proposals developed by the 100  engaged, passionate, and diverse young Australians who attended the 2020  Youth Summit on 12th and 13th April 2008.    

 Amongst the 100 delegates were Indigenous Australians, refugees, migrants,  and second, third, fourth or more generation Australians. There were young  mothers, people with disabilities, exceptionally gifted students and young carers.  The young people were of various faiths and cultures. They were from the  country; they were from the city. They brought their voices, experiences and  energy to the task of formulating a national vision for 2020.   

 The Summit itself was an historic step, allowing young people to shape our  national agenda. We hope it marks the beginning of an ongoing dialogue  between young Australians and their government and the continuing  engagement of youth in meaningful and high-level decision-making.    

 This communiquÃ© is a catalyst for discussion for delegates to the Australia 2020  Summit. It draws their attention to an ‘agenda of priorities’ determined by the  Youth Summit. The proposals contained in the agenda are practical, tangible,  and achievable. Appendix A contains the leading proposals as determined by the  Youth Summit delegation. Appendix B contains another 30 well-developed ideas  and proposals. Appendix C, which will be released at a later date, contains a list  of other ideas submitted by delegates prior to and during the Youth Summit. As a  whole, they testify to the potential and capacity of Australia’s young people to  shape our nation’s future.

 Call to action   

 We call upon the youth of Australia to join us in meeting the challenges of our  generation.    

 We recognize that to effectively deal with these challenges requires creative  thinking and new ideas.    

 We have proposed a range of ideas that paint a picture of the future for all  Australians.     

 Above all else we recognize that this is the start of a broader process, a process  that will require the great ideas and input of all 2.8 million young Australians. 

 

 Vision for Australia in 2020   

 Productivity Agenda - education, skills, training, science and innovation   Our vision is for a highly educated workforce, trained by skilled educators. A  strong emphasis on equitable wealth distribution through facilitating employment  opportunities will produce just outcomes and a strong economy. The efficient  allocation of resources in a diverse economy and support for the up-skilling of all  Australians, especially young people, will provide a strong foundation for the  future.   

 

 Infrastructure - Our vision is that technology is sustainable and accessible.  Investment in new and innovative infrastructure, particularly data, will ensure  equitable access for all Australians. Efficient transport and infrastructure across  states that encompasses movements of goods and commuters will ensure a  mobile workforce. Technology will encourage society to make connections  between communities and individuals.    

 

 Australian Governance - the future of Australian governance: renewed  democracy, a more open government (including the role of the media), the  structure of the Federation and the rights and responsibilities of citizens   Our vision is for Australian leaders that not only reflect the diversity of our  society, but are accessible, responsive and respected as positive role models. An  engaged and informed citizenry will understand the political process and its  relevance to their place in Australian society. The media will play a pivotal role in  democratic governance through fair representation and our rights as citizens will  be protected and paramount.    

 Australia's Future in the World - Australia’s future security and prosperity in a  rapidly changing region and world   Our vision is for a globally active and responsible nation. International relations  will be informed by recognising the contributions we can make to other nations  and the reciprocal benefits we may gain. Australia will contribute to global human  rights protection by assisting other countries in developing a rights culture.  Foreign aid will be revolutionised and broadened to encompass emerging global  issues, embracing refugees and immigration as part of our international  citizenship.    

 

 Communities and Families - strengthening communities, supporting families  and social inclusion   Our vision is to create safe environments for and in our families and  communities. This will be achieved through policies founded on prevention and  early intervention rather than simply short-term policies. There will be a  multifaceted approach to the problems experienced in our families and  communities. We know that healthy families and safe communities are important  to the development of young people. Our communities will engage in increased  and effective dialogue between urban, rural and remote, between communities,  between cultures and between each other. Australia will begin to value different  family structures. Meaningful dialogue will ensure continued community  engagement and enhance social cohesion.   

 

 Indigenous Australia - options for the future of Indigenous Australia   Our vision is to create meaningful and lasting change in Indigenous Australia by  committing ourselves, as all Australians, to reframe the relationship between  Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia. There is a sense of urgency in creating  solutions for Indigenous Australia, but we will not panic. As a nation, we will  reconceptualise our national identity and embrace the Indigenous spirit and  culture as a central part of the Australian story. The negotiation of a treaty or  similar document and the protection of Indigenous rights will provide the  principles on which we create effective policies and programs. We will use these  changes as a foundation for building practical policies and programs, particularly  in education, health and housing, in negotiation with Indigenous people,  particularly the young that make up a majority of that community.   

 

 Sustainability and Climate Change - population, sustainability, climate change  and water   Our vision is for Australia to be a world leader in addressing climate change, 

 environmental sustainability and innovation. Australia will become carbon neutral  and address all sources of carbon output. The economy, society and the  environment will be considered equally in all decisions made and the new  economy will be based on renewable energy. A positive and future-orientated 

 citizenry are rewarded for their contributions to the environment and in the  development of innovative strategies to tackling climate change. Australians will  be mobilised to respond through an increased awareness of climate change and  its effects. We will hold ourselves accountable for decisions made and respond  efficiently, effectively and in a timely manner to climate change.   

 

 Rural Australia - future directions for rural industries and rural communities   Our vision is for a changed perception of rural Australia and it’s importance to   the national economy and society and of all the opportunities in rural cities. All  rural Australians will have equitable access to human rights and opportunities in  health and education. Rural communities are creative, innovative and are well  supported in research and development. Rural Australia will be a cultural melting  pot and will be a place of choice for all Australians.   

 

 Health - a long-term national health strategy - including the challenges of  preventative health, workforce planning and the ageing population   Our vision is for equity of health for all Australians. We believe there needs to be  a structural and practical reorientation of the healthcare system from one that  cures illness to one that promotes wellness through actively empowering  individuals and communities towards healthy lifestyles. The main causes of our  chronic disease burden are societal. Social determinants of health need to be  addressed for mental illness, obesity, and drug and alcohol abuse, among many  others. The future lies within the expansion of primary healthcare with an  approach that involves all health care professionals. It is with this focus that we  must act to amend the shortages in healthcare services in rural and marginalised  communities.    

 

 Creative Australia - towards a creative Australia: the future of the arts, film and  design   Our vision is a creative nation which provides long-term funding programs that  support artists, arts workers, arts organisations and supplementary organisations  while they investigate options for long-term financial sustainability. In being  sustainable, artists will have access to a diverse range of living, working and  exhibition spaces. They also need support in broadening their skill base,  including financial literacy, administrative skills, legal compliance and promotional  skills. Increased opportunities to engage in artistic and creative fields will arise  though both formal and informal modes of education and mentorship. A creative  Australia will foster free and open public access to creative products, process  and spaces. 

 

 Top 10 Ideas    

 

 Productivity Agenda - education, skills, training, science and innovation   Paid Parental Leave Program  A national paid parental leave program for both working men and women, which  includes incentives that promote affordability and accessibility of childcare, will  help to address the challenges of workplace participation for all Australians. This  scheme will increase productivity at work, provide incentives for employers to  accommodate a healthy work/life balance, and help to address gender  imbalances in the workplace.    

 

 Infrastructure  By youth for youth community infrastructure for tomorrow and today  The creation of amalgamated business and community centres for youth will  encourage entrepreneurship and community-building activities. Readily available  information to aid the professional devlopment of youth and opportunities to  network with other “changemakers” will help to break down barriers to  participation. Young artists, entrepreneurs and those active in community service  will be provided with the physical infrastructure to implement their ideas. A focus  on the inclusion of disadvantaged youth will serve to increase the number of joint  projects run by young Australians as well as community participation.    

 

 Sustainability and Climate Change - population, sustainability, climate change  and water   Australian Sustainability Challenge  Climate change is a global problem that has many local solutions.  The  Australian Sustainability Challenge (‘Challenge’) would create an incentive for  local governments to improve their sustainability through constructive  competition.  Local government areas would be awarded points for various  activities like: increasing % renewable energy being used, increasing % of  constituents traveling via public transport/foot/bicycle, increasing % of water  being heated via solar hot water/gas, increasing % of native vegetation through  tree planting programs, % improvement in sustainability of building codes to  name a few.  The local governments that achieve the highest number of points  would be rewarded by ‘winning’ a substantial federal grant.  Communities that  demonstrate the most innovative approach to becoming more sustainable would  also be rewarded.  The award money could be spent on a local community  priority (like a public wind farm, new health care facilities, a public swimming  pool, etc).  The local governments will be judged annually with the results being  publicly announced across all states so local climate change achievements are  proudly acknowledged and celebrated.    The Challenge would empower local communities to work together, educate  each other and think outside the square.  By combining the Challenge with 

 meaningful national schemes that encourage sustainable practices (eg: feed-in-tariffs for renewable energy, funding for local energy/water cooperatives,  investment in public transport/bicycle lanes, etc) all Australians would be  encouraged to engage in our ‘sustainability’ agenda.   

 

 Rural Australia - future directions for rural industries and rural communities   Rural Futures Development Bank  The rural fund development bank is a funding strategy aimed at supporting  research and development activities into new agricultural technologies.  Specifically, the research and development will be directed towards innovative  methods of agriculture including the cultivation of new cropping varieties.  Essentially the research and development will produce ways in which traditional  agricultural practices can be adapted to maximises the new conditions brought 

 upon Australia by climate change such as changing temperatures and decreased  water availability. Further to this, the initiative will include the extension of  existing programs designed to educate growers on sustainable technologies and  additional assistance for growers in the take up of these new technologies and  the development of more efficient irrigation and water management techniques.  Potentially, new innovations in Australian agriculture will be shared with our  neighbours and Australia will remain the global leader in combating climate  change.   

 

 Health - a long-term national health strategy - including the challenges of  preventative health, workforce planning and the ageing population   Primary Healthcare Project Committee  We propose a federally-funded peak body incorporating members of non-governmental organisations and government departments that provides a  systematic approach to expanding existing preventative health strategies that  have proven successful. We will need to identify best practice models, both  locally and abroad, and support these programs to be implemented in like  communities on a national level   

 

 Communities and Families - strengthening communities, supporting families  and social inclusion   National Migrant and Refugees Settlement Strategy   Managing and accommodating the influx of migrants and refugees into our  country requires a multifaceted approach. There is a need to develop a national  migrant and refugee settlement strategy to provide essential services aimed at  settling and including newly-arrived migrants and refugees into Australian  society. The outcomes of this strategy are to measure the proportion of migrants  and refugees who access available health, language and capacity building  services. The strategy will also evaluate the literacy levels of migrant and refugee  communities and measure the employment rate and length of unemployment. 

 Moreover this holistic approach will help wider Australian communities  accommodate migrant and refugee settlement. This will be done through a  process of widespread consultation with local migrants and refugee service 

 providers, state governments and relevant stakeholders.   

 

 Indigenous Australia - options for the future of Indigenous Australia   National Dialogue Towards a Treaty  The political and legal recognition of Indigenous Australia should be pursued  through the signing of a treaty or similar document between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia. The process of negotiation will ensure all Australians can  participate in a national dialogue that promotes understanding between  individuals and communities. Negotiation can only occur with a strong and united  national Indigenous voice and with the participation of young people. A treaty will  create a foundation for a new relationship between all Australians, which allows  us to make meaningful change in practical policies and programs.   

 

 Creative Australia - towards a creative Australia: the future of the arts, film and  design   New Funding Opportunities for the Arts  We need to extend funding beyond project-based-funding. This means providing  funding to allow artists and arts organisations to be sustainable. It is proposed  that a cohort-based supplementary income grants scheme be established. This  pool of funds would allow artists to draw on income funding as they develop their  practice and to engage with emerging and established artists in their fields.  Moreover, funding to support arts workers and support and auxiliary  organizations needs to be made available to allow for long term planning and  collaboration. This approach represents a genuine commitment to supporting  artists to develop their creative and professional practice.    

 

 Australian Governance - the future of Australian governance: renewed  democracy, a more open government (including the role of the media), the  structure of the Federation and the rights and responsibilities of citizens   Vote for a Better Vote: Our Democracy Depends on it  Enhancing the participation of civic society in electoral processes is vital to 

 ensuring our political representatives reflect the aspirations of the Australian  people. Particularly important is ensuring greater engagement in electoral  processes by disadvantaged and marginalized people.    

 We envision an Australia where citizens are automatically enrolled to vote, a  process crucial to removing existing barriers to electoral participation. Automatic  enrolment would necessitate co-operation between the Australian Electoral 

 Commission and national agencies such as the Australian Tax Office, Centrelink  and Medicare. There also needs to be significant investment in engaging 

 electorally disadvantaged Australians - specifically those who are homeless or  without a fixed address - by the Australian Electoral Commission.   

 Further, to build a more participatory 2020, the age at which people are eligible to  vote must be lowered to 16. 16 year olds work, pay income tax, pay GST, drive,  and can join the army. They must be enfranchised so they can have a say in  Government policies that affect them.   

 At polling places, we also believe there should be the ability to vote via computer,  to save paper and speed up vote counting. We believe this aspect of our  proposed electoral reform for a stronger, more democratic 2020 should be  optional.   

 

 Australia's Future in the World - Australia’s future security and prosperity in a  rapidly changing region and world   Track2 for Access to Essential Medicines  As a complement to the current drug patent systems, this mechanism rewards  innovators in proportion to the global health impact of their interventions. To  access this payment stream, stakeholders would allow the open manufacture,  distribution and sale of their products. Consequently, diseases which  disproportionately affect the poor become profitable targets of research and  development.   

 By making this option available for specific medicines, it will become immediately  available for competitive manufacturers. The price of drugs will subsequently be  driven down to near production cost. As the price is based on actual health  impact, pharmaceutical companies also have an incentive to upgrade health  services in disadvantaged areas, furthering their contribution to their corporate  social responsibilities in our global community.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Conclusion    

 It is often said that young people are the leaders of tomorrow. The dynamic  visions articulated at the Youth Summit and embodied in this document confirm  that they will be inspirational leaders in 2020. The creative and practical policy 

 proposals developed by the 100 Summit delegates confirm they will be able to  achieve those visions. In 2020, Australia will be in extremely capable hands.   

 But young people are also the leaders of today. If you give them half a chance  they will astound you with their energy and idealism. More importantly, they will  impress you with their maturity and willingness to engage constructively in the 

 process of improving our local communities, states, this nation, and our world.   

 At the Youth Summit, Australia’s youth embraced the opportunity to convey their  ideas and proposals to their government. They hope that their government listen.  For no-one has more at stake in ensuring Australia’s future than its young  Australians.    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Appendix - Additional 30 ideas   

 Productivity Agenda and Economy - education, skills, training, science and  innovation    

 1. National Education Network  The creation of a national curriculum and syllabus for primary and secondary  education applicable throughout Australia. This would include a single university  admission system, an adapted national VET framework, and measures to  increase access to quality education in rural areas. The new curriculum would  adopt a global focus, including an emphasis on the study of foreign languages,  global studies, and international exchanges.   

 2. Paid Parental Leave - Affordability and Accessibility  The introduction of a Universal and national paid parental leave scheme for both  working men and women, along with initiatives that promote affordability and  accessibility of childcare, will help to address the challenges of workplace  participation for all Australians.   

 3. Science and Incentives and a High Tech Sustainable Economy  To move towards a high tech sustainable economy, financial incentives should  encourage businesses to invest in science and technology, education, research  and development. Such a move would include making science a part of the  national secondary curriculum, providing incentives for universities to undertake  research and development on issues such as clean energy, and promoting a  culture of science-based dialogue in Australian society.   

 4. Better Education - Better Teachers  The quality of an education system is only as good as the quality of its teachers.  We need to promote the professional development and training of teachers  including encouraging further studies and ongoing training. In keeping with the  National Reform Agenda, this aims to offset the potential loss in productivity  caused by the aging population by increasing the quality of Australia’s human  capital resources (the quality and quantity of out workforce). This is most  efficiently done by increasing the quality and retention-rates of our teachers at  schools.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Infrastructure -    

 1. Youth Run Youth Community Infrastructure for Tomorrow, Today.  The creation of amalgamated business and community centres for youth will  encourage entrepreneurship and community building activities. Readily available  information to aid the professional development of youth and opportunities to  network with other ‘change makers’ will help to break down barriers to  participation. Productivity will be improved and output maximised as young  artists, entrepreneurs and those active in community service are provided with  the physical infrastructure to implement their ideas. A focus on disadvantaged  youth will serve to increase the number of joint projects run by young Australians  as well as community participation.   

 

 2. Seamless and Integrated Transport Infrastructure  A nationalised and streamlined network of transport encompassing roads, rail,  sea and airports will reduce congestion and reliance on relatively inefficient road  transport. Integrated ticketing and timetables on all forms of public transport  implemented by State Authorities will more efficiently carry commuters and  reduce bottlenecks in city areas. Significant improvements in the quality of  regional road networks will serve to connect all Australians and an emphasis on  moving road freight to rail will improve our capacity to move goods.    

 

 3. Data Infrastructure to Support a 2020 Economy  The construction of a national Fibre to the Premises network that can be run  alongside power and telephone lines will provide all Australians will fast and cost-effective Internet access. Continual improvement to wireless Internet services  ensures rural Australians are provided with equal access to high speed data  transfers. Additional funding for research into communication technology for  Australian environments will help to address climate change challenges.   

 4. Heavy Duty Renewable Power Stations  The development of heavy duty, large output power stations are created in  addition to existing stations that will be progressively replaced. The nation’s  demand for energy will be entirely met by renewable and non-nuclear power  sources. Sustainable use of resources will ensure demand will continue to be  met as the load on power station continues to climb.    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Australian Governance - the future of Australian governance: renewed  democracy, a more open government (including the role of the media), the  structure of the Federation and the rights and responsibilities of citizens    

 1. My Vote Counts  Enhancing the participation of civic society in electoral processes is vital to  ensuring our political representatives further reflect the desires of the populace.  Particularly important is ensuring a far greater engagement amongst  disadvantaged and marginalized communities.   We’d like to imagine an Australian society where citizens are automatically  enrolled to vote, a process vital to ensuring a breaking down of existing barriers  to electoral participation. This would involve data transfer from national agencies  like the Australian Tax Office, Centrelink and Medicare to the Australian Electoral  Commission   Importantly people who don’t have addresses, like homeless people and people  in remote communities, should be accessed in far greater numbers face to face  by Australian Electoral Commission staff to engage them in the voting process.  This needs a significant further investment.  Further, to build a more participatory 2020 the age at which people must be  enrolled to vote is lowered to 16.  At polling places, we also believe there should be the ability to vote via computer,  to save paper and speed up vote counting. We believe this section of Electoral  Reform for a stronger, more democratic 2020 should be optional.   

 2. Bill of Rights  To develop a national Bill of Rights that reflects the fundamental human rights of  Australians and which takes into account Australia’s common law tradition and  constitutional structure. This would not be an absolute Bill of Rights like in the  United States of America. It would be a qualified Bill of Rights modelled, as a  bare minimum, on the Victorian Bill of Rights. The degree of constitutional  entrenchment and the degree to which the judiciary can override inconsistent  legislation must be debated and balance. Fundamental human rights including,  inter alia, the right to be free from torture, genocide and slavery, should have a  high level of entrenchment as they are rights from which no derogation is  permissible under any circumstances.   

 3. Civics Education Program   

 Vision for Idea  A program that ensures young people see and understand the link between  issues that affect their lives and opportunities to create change. This can be  perpetuated through the creation of a core school subject about the political and  community engagement process. It focuses on engagement, comparative  political systems, debate, processes and practical interactive methods, beyond  traditional political institutions.   

 4. Culture Change - Australia celebrates cultural diversity  To celebrate Australia Day as Harmony Day where all Australians are socially-included.  Australia's symbols represent our nation's diversity. Anti-discrimination laws are  in place across the nation and improved to protect the diverse communities * of  Australia.  Australia embraces, protects and rejoices in its diversity.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Australia's Future in the World - Australia’s future security and prosperity in a  rapidly changing region and world    

 1. Humanitarian Intervention  Strengthening humanitarian intervention principles is critical to Australia’s  interests and to those of the world.  Humanitarian intervention, as a drastic re-thinking of traditional state sovereignty, represents the new frontier in  international relations. Given Australia’s extensive connection to the development  of humanitarian intervention, particularly former Foreign Minister Gareth Evans’  leadership in the field and Australia’s lauded interventions in Cambodia and East  Timor, Australia has the talents and the credibility to lead the world towards a  codified doctrine.   

 2. National Linguistic and Cultural Platform  The creation of government agency parallel to “study in Australia” that stimulates  collaboration between Universities enforces mandatory learning of foreign  languages in secondary schools and assist businesses with linguistics retraining.  This agency could also facilitate educational and business exchange, GAP years  and volunteer work and linguistic support for Australians returning to Australia  after practicing a language abroad.  Furthermore, this agency would encourage the passing on of the maternal  tongues of new Australians, both to their family and the rest of society. It would  also facilitate connections between Australians, migrants, refugees and foreign  exchange students.   

 3. Global Health InitiativeAs a complement to the current drug patent systems  this would be a mechanism that rewards innovators in proportion to the global  health impact of their interventions. To access this payment stream, stakeholders  would allow the open manufacture distribution and sale of their products.  With this option in place diseases that do great harm mainly among the poor  become profitable targets of R and D. By choosing this option for a specific  medicine, innovators make it immediately available for competitive  manufacturers. The price of drugs would then drop to near the marginal cost of  production. As the price is based on actual health impact drug companies also  have an incentive to upgrade health services in disadvantaged areas.    

 

 4. A deployable public serviceTo train a reserve of strategic level government  professionals in technical assistance in less developed countries and failed  states. That this reserve be readily deployable, in whole or in part, at the request  of regional governments or where Australia is required to intervene in the event  of a collapsed state.   

 

 Communities and Families - strengthening communities, supporting families  and social inclusion    

 1. Reform of funding models  That for every dollar invested in community service provision at the crisis end of  the intervention spectrum, the government is required to invest an equivalent  proportion into prevention and early intervention services, including community  capacity building models.  This would involve an audit and evaluation of previous, current and or future  prevention and early intervention services. The results of this evaluation would  be then used to create social / economic modelling that indicates the costs /  benefits of prevention and early intervention versus crisi intervention. This would  inform the ratio attributed to prevention and early intervention in the new funding  model.    

 2. National Migrant and Refugees Settlement Strategy  To develop a national migrant and refugee settlement strategy to provide  essential services to include and settle newly-arrived migrants and refugees into  Australian society. This will be done through a process of widespread  consultation with local migrants and refugee service providers, state government  and relevant stakeholders.The outcomes of this strategy are to measure the  proportion of migrants and refugees who access available services, appraise the  literacy levels of migrant and refugee communities and measure the employment  rate and length of unemployment. And help wider Australilan communities  accommodate migrant and refugee settlement.   

 3. Paid Parental Leave  A National Paid Parental Leave legislation which works to compensate parents  for the income they lose when they have a child, provide parents and children  with the time necessary to form a close and enduring bond and which facilitates  gender balance within the family. This paid parental leave would be available not  only to biological mothers and fathers but also adoptive parents, same sex  parents and legal guardians.   

 4. Safe Relationships: National Primary Prevention Initiative for Domestic  Violence  In Australia in 2008 there exists only a superficial understanding of Domestic  Violence (DV). While there is broad acceptance that physical violence within  intimate relationships is not acceptable, recognition of psychological abuse,  emotional abuse, financial abuse and other controlling types of behaviour is less 

 prevalent. Also the gendered nature of DV has long been glossed over, if charge  is to be released, the issue of gender dynamics and inddues of male power need  to be confronted. As such, we see the need for a National Domestic Violence  Primary Prevention Initiative that addresses these issues through a national peer  education strategy and media campaign.    

 Indigenous Australia - options for the future of Indigenous Australia    

 1. National Dialogue towards a Treaty   

 The political and legal recognition of Indigenous Australia should be pursued  through the signing of a treaty between Indigenous and non-Indigenous  Australia. Negotiation can only occur with a strong and united national  Indigenous voice and with the participation of young people. A treaty will create a  foundation for a new relationship between all Australians, which allows us to  make meaningful change in policies and programs. It will also begin an important  national dialogue around our national identity and the way forward for our nation.    

 2. Indigenous Health   

 A two-pronged approach to Indigenous health is needed which would see  governments make a greater investment in health infrastructure in remote  communities. As well as this investment, there must exist a model of health  management that would enable Indigenous people to self-regulate the lifestyle  choices and impart healthy standards within their community.    

 3. Indigenous Community-based Education   

 Australia must address the disparities of educational outcomes and opportunities  for Indigenous Australians we propose to implement Indigenous specific life skill  programs covering drug, alcohol, violence, financial literacy, relationships and  sex education. There also needs to be literacy and numeracy, culture and  language programs. These will be targeted at age appropriate groupings through  institutional education and also through broader community education.    

 4. National Indigenous Home Ownership Strategy   

 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should have the opportunity to own  their own homes by 2020. Homes must be incorporate sustainable design and  involve new opportunities for communities through apprenticeships and training  programs. The strategy should involve partnerships with public and private 

 sectors and generational mortgages. This strategy is key to improving Indigenous  lifestyles and bridging the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous  Australians.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Sustainability and Climate Change - population, sustainability, climate change  and water    

 1. Australian Sustainability Challenge (ASC)   

 Climate change is a global problem that has many local solutions.  The  Australian Sustainability Challenge (‘Challenge’) would create an incentive for  local governments to improve their sustainability through constructive  competition.  Local government areas would be awarded points for various  activities like: increasing % renewable energy being used, increasing % of  constituents traveling via public transport/foot/bicycle, increasing % of water  being heated via solar hot water/gas, increasing % of native vegetation through  tree planting programs, % improvement in sustainability of building codes to  name a few.  The local governments that achieve the highest number of points  would be rewarded by ‘winning’ a substantial federal grant.  Communities that  demonstrate the most innovative approach to becoming more sustainable would  also be rewarded.  The award money could be spent on a local community  priority (like a public wind farm, new health care facilities, a public swimming  pool, etc).  The local governments will be judged annually with the results being  publicly announced across all states so local climate change achievements are  proudly acknowledged and celebrated.    The Challenge would empower local communities to work together, educate  each other and think outside the square.  By combining the Challenge with  meaningful national schemes that encourage sustainable practices (eg: feed-in-tariffs for renewable energy, funding for local energy/water cooperatives,  investment in public transport/bicycle lanes, etc) all Australians would be  encouraged to engage in our ‘sustainability’ agenda.    

 2. Setting a national framework to tackle climate change   

 Federal Government will set up a wide scale national framework for climate  change to cover the issues currently within all levels of government that dictate  minimum action, not just benchmarks. Introduce incentives to encourage  interstate competition to exceed those minimum action requirements. Implement  a bold accountability scheme through various avenues that do not allow any level  of government to postpone action. Pass laws to cut emissions in accordance with  strong science-based targets.    

 3. Climate Change Curriculum in Schools: Eco-Ed   

 Implement programs to ensure compulsory climate change and sustainability  education are part of the mainstream curriculum in primary and secondary  education. Develop a different blue print, which is  Communicate the message of 

 sustainability in all subject areas and implement programs to encourage teachers  to raise the impacts of climate change in all key learning and subject areas.    

 4. Public Transport for all- 2KGo   

 To ensure that every Australian in urban areas lives within two kilometres of a  train station, light rail corridor or high-frequency bus route by 2020. Implement a  London-style congestion tax with associated funding injected into further public  transport infrastructure to encourage the movement towards car-free CBDs.

 Rural Australia - future directions for rural industries and rural communities  

 

 1. Strengthening rural skills  Rural and regional Australia will become a place of choice for skilled workers. A  phased program coordinated by State and Local Governments will increase the  communication between rural and metropolitan regions, draw attention to specific  rural industries (particularly those with skills shortages), encourage students to  rural industries and areas through funded work experience programs and provide  mentoring support for newly-arrived residents.   

 2. Rural Fund Development Bank  The Rural Fund Development Bank is a funding strategy supported by Industry,  all levels of Government and grower cooperatives. This strategy will support  research and development of agricultural technologies that will minimise the  impacts of climate change, sustainability and the water crisis. The investment  strategy will specifically fund research and development in the areas of  innovative cropping varieties cultivated to withstand altered temperatures and  decreased water availability, extension of existing programs designed to educate  growers on sustainable agricultural technologies, assistance for growers in the  take-up of new agricultural technologies and the development of more efficient  irrigation and water management techniques.   

 3. Discovering rural Australia  Rural and regional areas of Australia will be promoted across the nation as a  place of choice. The media campaign will dispel the many common  misconceptions of rural and regional Australia and promote understanding and  awareness of our country areas, the communities, industries, people and  lifestyles. Promotion will be focused around positive media campaigns designed  to create awareness and attraction.  Discovering rural Australia is not a tourism  initiative it is a call for Australians to relocate to rural and regional areas.   

 4. Equitable rural access to education  All young people in rural and regional areas will have access to have financial  support for access to tertiary education. The initiative will seek to amend  legislative amendments to youth allowance with the view to increase funding for  rural and regional youth. In addition to this, financial allowances will be made  available to rural and regional youth to assist with the financial burden of  undertaking tertiary education outside of their residential area. Furthermore,  there will be an increase to the number and value of Commonwealth learning  scholarships and substantial funding for the Australian Rural Education Alliance,  complimented by a national rural education strategy.   

 

 

 

 Health - a long-term national health strategy - including the challenges of  preventative health, workforce planning and the ageing population  

 

 1. Rural workforce shortage  We believe upscaling current scholarship and mentorship programs available for  rural students across all health disciplines is a necessary first step in attracting  and retaining health professionals to rural areas. Further to this  we believe that  healthcare students need to be increasingly exposed during their education with  a multidisciplinary flavour. Furthermore in order to retain health practitioners  involves infrastructure to increase professional support as well as job and life  satisfaction.   

 2. Mental healthcare  Through youth focused, youth-driven education programs run in all schools, we  hope to raise awareness, destigmatise and educate students about mental health  issues. This program will use contemporary mediums such as film and  multimedia will be structured in such a way that will specifically address early  detection and information on how to access youth friendly services     

 It is our objective to help reduce drug and alcohol abuse, suicide, increase  awareness of and access to pre-exisiting mental health services, and cause a  real shift in attitudes of school students towards mental health. A key component  of our strategy is that it is delivered by consumers and health care professionals.   

 The measurable objectives we propose incorporate;   

 3. National public health strategy   

 We propose the creation of a fund would be managed by a central body which  systematically identifies and evaluates successful public health programs in  communities (nationally and internationally) and expands these programs 

 nationally to these communities which have a similar need.    

 Currently, public health measures comprise only six percent of national health  expenditure. We promote an immediate and substantial increase in primary  health funding to twenty percent. In the short-term, this would mean an overall  increase in health spending. However, given the high cost of tertiary level care,  the decrease in chronic lifestyle diseases in twenty to thirty years time will lead to  an overall decrease in health spending.    

 The measurable objectives we propose incorporate;   

 

 

 

 

 4. Adolescent medicine scheme   

 Many young people seeking to health professionals do not feel comfortable  discussing issues with their parents and guardians. They therefore go  unaddressed.   

 We propose to increase accessibility of healthcare services to young people in a  confidential environment where they can discuss these issues. We hope to  achieve this through the automatic distribution of medicare cards to young  Australians upon turning thirteen years of age. This would not only increase  accessibility but also act as a tool for prevention and early detection of health-related issues. We feel that many issues surrounding the health of young people  stem from the inability to access Medicare cards as they are in the names of  parents and guardians   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Creative Australia - towards a creative Australia: the future of the arts, film and  design    

 1: New Opportunities for Arts Funding   

 We need to extend funding beyond project-based-funding. This means providing  funding to allow artists and arts organisations to be sustainable. It is proposed  that a cohort-based supplementary income grants scheme be established. This 

 pool of funds would allow artists to draw on income funding as they develop their  practice and to engage with emerging and established artists in their fields.  Moreover, funding to support arts workers and support and auxiliary  organizations needs to be made available to allow for long term planning and 

 collaboration.    

 This approach represents a genuine commitment to supporting artists to develop  their creative and professional practice.    

 2: Building Creative Community, Literally  Innovative town planning has the capacity to foster creativity and innovation  within a community. Town planning should prioritise exhibition and performance  spaces for both the visual and the performing arts. We propose that the Federal  government investigate the possibility of an incentive scheme to encourage  property developers to invest in housing complexes that include versatile creative  spaces.   

 New developments should include a quota of affordable housing for artists within  high density residential areas. These developments should include versatile  spaces the encompass the entire creative process, including idea, conception, 

 production, promotion, exhibition and evaluation (a creative hub). These should  be located in areas with well-established and emerging artistic communities.  They must be located in areas serviced by public transport infrastructure. Artists  should be included in the process of town planning.    

 3: Educating for a creative nation  Australia’s formal education system needs to facilitate and foster participation in  creative arts. Secondary schools curricula should provide a variety of creative  subject choices. These subjects should include many opportunities for the  appreciation of art and opportunities to engage with a range of creative products  and processes. They should include the breadth of creative arts and be open to  enrolment for all students. In the assessment process, these subjects should not  be weighted or scaled in a way that devalues creative intelligence. At a tertiary  level, there should be world-renowned funded creative arts academies  that are accessible to all Australians.    

 4. Giving artists what they need  Australian artists need infrastructure that is accessible and supports the entire  artistic process, from the idea and conception to promotion and exhibition and to  evaluation. Artists need more than a technical proficiency in their art practice in  order to survive and thrive. They require practical skills such as accounting, 

 administration, legal, promotion and other ‘business’ skills. In 2020 Australia  needs a system that provides support for artists to develop these skills, including  a mentorship scheme that facilitates non-artists mentors in business practice for  emerging artists. Access to existing training in these identified skill sets should be  available to all people undertaking training in the creative arts.  

 Conclusion    

 It is often said that young people are the leaders of tomorrow. The dynamic  visions articulated at the Youth Summit and embodied in this document confirm  that they will be inspirational leaders in 2020. The creative and practical policy 

 proposals developed by the 100 Summit delegates confirm they will be able to  achieve those visions. In 2020, Australia will be in extremely capable hands.   

 But young people are also the leaders of today. If you give them half a chance  they will astound you with their energy and idealism. More importantly, they will  impress you with their maturity and willingness to engage constructively in the  process of improving our local communities, states, this nation, and our world. 

 

 At the Youth Summit, Australia’s youth embraced the opportunity to convey their  ideas and proposals to their government. They hope that their government listen.  For no-one has more at stake in ensuring Australia’s future than its young  Australians.
