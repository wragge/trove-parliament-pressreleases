 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - PARLIAMENT HOUSE,  CANBERRA,  TUESDAY, 15 JUNE 2004 

 

 SUBJECT: HUNGER STRIKE ON NAURU, EARLY ELECTION,  BIG BROTHER EVICTION; PETER GARRETT   

 

 SMITH: There are reports overnight of a hunger strike in Nauru.  The reports  suggest that some of the Iraqis are on a hunger strike.     

 Overnight I’ve asked the Minister’s office for an urgent report as to the situation so far as  these reports are concerned.    

 If it is the case that some of the Iraqis on Nauru are on hunger strike, then let’s make sure  that the Government learns from the previous hunger strike and ensures that appropriate  medical facilities and resources are available.   

 There are 56 Iraqis on Nauru.  I’ve been saying for some time that the Government can’t  leave those Iraqis in a state of suspended animation or in a state of limbo.  This has  particularly been the case since the Government announced the reconsideration of Iraqi  Temporary Protection Visa holders in Australia following deteriorating circumstances in  Iraq. 

 

 This is a serious report overnight.  I hope the Government is in a position to give me an  urgent report today.  If it is the case that some of the Iraqis are on hunger strike, then the  Government needs to learn from the mistakes they made earlier in the year and ensure 

 that appropriate medical facilities and resources are made available forthwith.   

 JOURNALIST: What is your feeling about an election now…inaudible?    

 SMITH: I’ve always been at the early end of market expectations.  My entry into  the sweepstake has been Saturday 4 September, the first Saturday of September.  But as I  say, I have been at the early end of market expectations.  It’s a matter for the Prime  Minister.  I suspect it will be sometime September, October, November. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Is it time for Labor to start releasing more of its policies?   

 SMITH: There are plenty of Labor policies out there.  As Mark has made clear  when we’re good and ready, when we think the time is right, we’ll be out there with even  more policies.     

 JOURNALIST: But time could be running out, is that a bit worrying?   

 SMITH: Time never runs out until its 5pm on the Friday before Election Day and  some even say, until 6pm on the Saturday.   

 JOURNALIST: What do you think the feedbacks been like with the recruitment of  Peter Garrett?   

 SMITH: Very good.  I think it’s a very positive development.  It shows Labor’s got  dynamism and energy.  I see the Prime Minister is out there talking about an energy  policy.  It’s taken him 8 years to put an energy policy together: it really shows they have  got no energy.  The significant endorsement we’ve had from Peter Garrett, a person of  commitment and passion, of intelligence, he’s going to make a significant contribution to  the Parliament and the Labor Party.  It’s good news for Labor.  It shows we’ve got  energy.  The fact the Government is out there after 8 years trying to trump up an energy  policy shows that they’ve got none.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you think parents should have access to children’s medical  records?   

 SMITH: I’ll happily leave that to Julia Gillard.  I used to be Shadow Health  spokesperson, but no longer.   

 JOURNALIST: With these Iraqis hunger strikers on Nauru, is it just Iraqis or do  you know of any others?   

 SMITH: The reports that I’ve seen overnight relate to Iraqis.  There are 56 Iraqis on  Nauru.  As you know as a result of changed circumstances in various parts of  Afghanistan, there has been a reconsideration and a reassessment of Afghans on Nauru.   Some 150 have been reconsidered and reassessed in recent times.  The reports I’ve  received relate to some of the 56 Iraqis there.   

 JOURNALIST: What do you make of Big Brother?   

 SMITH: I think it just reflects the fact that people in the community are concerned  about people being detained for very long periods.  That particularly applies to children  which is why we’ve been saying since 2002 that children should not be in detention.   

 JOURNALIST:  Senator  Vanstone  says he is ill informed.   

 SMITH: I think the point that Senator Vanstone was making was the quite  legitimate point, which is, if a person has been assessed as a refugee, then they are not  detained.  I say I think it reflects a growing concern in the community, of people across  the nation, being concerned with people being detained for long periods.  I think the  community adopts the same approach that Labor does, which is, if people come here and  make a claim for asylum, if they are assessed as refugees they are resettled in the usual  way, and if they are not refugees, then when it is safe to do so they are returned to their  country of origin.
