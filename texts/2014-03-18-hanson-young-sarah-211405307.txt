 Abbott’s war on refugees takes a hit on ‘Complementary  Protection’ 

 The Abbott Government’s attempts to remove essential protections for refugees have taken a hit  today with the Greens declaring their opposition to a bill that would remove Australia’s  ‘Complementary Protection’ obligations. 

 In a report tabled in the Senate this afternoon the Greens have expressed their concerns about the  attempt to remove this law which allows torture victims, sufferers of female genital mutilation and  women  

 fleeing forced marriages and honour killings to apply for protection in Australia. 

 “This reckless Abbott Government wants to deny protection to as many refugees as possible,” the  Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said. 

 “Without Complementary Protection, the Immigration Minister himself will decide who gets  protection and who gets sent home with a single stroke of his pen. 

 “This Government’s unhealthy obsession with power and its fixation on cruelty to refugees is  creating a dangerous situation for human rights in Australia. 

 “Thousands of women and children need Complementary Protection to get a fair hearing but the  Immigration Minister is trying to make himself judge and jury by repealing these laws. 

 “Based on his previous behaviour, Scott Morrison is the last person who should be trusted with  deciding the fate of vulnerable women and children fleeing torture and oppression. 

 “The Greens will vote against the removal of Complementary Protection in the Senate.”
