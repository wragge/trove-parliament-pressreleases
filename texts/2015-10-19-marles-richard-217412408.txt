 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION   MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 

 APPROPRIATE MEDICAL TREATMENT OF ASYLUM SEEKERS     

 I am aware of legitimate concerns within the community about the treatment of a  Somalian asylum seeker since she first made a plea to the Australian Government  for a termination.    

 There is no doubt this is a sensitive case and the last thing we want to do is breach  her privacy during what is a difficult time.     

 The Government should make it clear that this woman will continue to be provided  with unrestricted access to health and counselling professionals.    

 It is vital that any refugee or asylum seeker requiring medical treatment, including  access to a termination is granted that health care without qualification and, where  necessary, in Australia.    

 It is important to be assured that this woman has been treated with dignity and  afforded appropriate time to determine what is the right choice for her.    

 Any decision she makes about her pregnancy should be entirely a private matter  between her and health experts, including counselling professionals.    

 The Government must provide an assurance that in respect of this woman all of this  has occurred.
