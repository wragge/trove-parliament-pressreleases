 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/833 TUESDAY 31 AUGUST 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS & SPOKESPERSON ON IMMIGRATION  Bartlett calls for 'children overboard' eyewitness Australian Democrats' Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, has called for an eye witness from the SIEV 4 boat to appear before the reconvened 'Children Overboard' inquiry.  Senator Bartlett said he would like to see some of the refugees from the so-called 'children overboard' boat given the opportunity to tell what occurred. Senator Bartlett, who was on the original Senate inquiry, explored the option of the Committee speaking to the refugees then, but at the time they were all imprisoned on Manus Island and it was not feasible.   "A lot of people have given evidence and opinions about what happened in the children overboard affair, but we have not heard from the people who were there and who were defamed so badly. "These refugees have been at the centre of this particular political football game for three years, but they have not had the chance to have their say on the public record. "Given that there has not even been an apology forthcoming for these refugees who were seriously defamed by the Prime Minister and senior Ministers, the least they deserve is an opportunity to have their say before the Senate Committee that has spent so much time investigating the matter." Senator Bartlett said he would be disappointed if the Committee did not allow an eyewitness refugee to come forward. Senator Bartlett also said he hoped the ALP would adopt a more humane refugee policy before the election. "Mark Latham's comments that asylum seekers should be treated with decency are hypocritical when Labor is not willing to abolish mandatory detention.  Labor's 'solution' is to replace one remote island detention centre - Nauru - with another - Christmas Island," Senator Bartlett said. Labor says they will release children in detention- but they will be in mini-detention centres, so-called 'residential housing projects'. These projects are surrounded by fences, cameras and guards - therefore children are still detention. "Labor is just proposing to beat refugee families with a slightly smaller stick."
