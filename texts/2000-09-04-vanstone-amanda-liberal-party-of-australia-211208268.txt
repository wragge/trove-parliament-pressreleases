 Coastwatch intercepts about 60 boat people Customs Coastwatch today arranged the interception of a vessel carrying an estimated 60 boat people* near Ashmore Islands, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today.

 The vessel, a motorised Indonesian fishing vessel, was detected on a strategic patrol by a Coastwatch long-range Dash-8 aircraft, which shadowed the vessel as it headed towards Ashmore islands.

 The vessel was then intercepted by the Customs vessel Wauri which is on long-term patrol off north-western Australia.

 First reports indicated about 60 people, of Middle Eastern origin, were on the vessel. In addition, five crew members were aboard.

 Senator Vanstone said the interception was a success for the co-ordinated program of maritime surveillance directed by Customs Coastwatch.

 "This interception featured covert surveillance by air and rapid response by sea, to quickly detect people attempting to arrive unlawfully in Australia," Senator Vanstone said.

 The people will be handed to officials of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs when they reach the mainland. Transport arrangements are yet to be finalised.

 * The exact number of boat people will not be confirmed until Customs officers have secured and searched the vessel.
