  Media Release  Senator the Hon Amanda Vanstone  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

  BURKE SHIRKS ON BORDER PROTECTION 

  Labor’s immigration spokesman Tony Burke has today revealed the depth of Labor’s  policy bankruptcy by claiming the changes to immigration law announced today are  “radical” but failing to state whether Labor will support them, Minister for Immigration and  Multicultural Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today. 

  “Labor cannot claim to support a strong border security regime that protects our  sovereignty without stating its position on the Government’s strengthened border control  measures for unauthorised boat arrivals,” the Minister said. 

  “Tony Burke is walking both sides of the street hand-in-hand with Kim Beazley. 

  “Mr Burke’s ten months as Opposition spokesman for Immigration has been marked only  by a complete absence of a coherent or articulated immigration and border protection  policy from Labor)’, the Minister said. 

  If Kim Beazley wants the Australian people to forget his previous flip-flops on national  security issues, Labor must deliver real and substantial policies. 

  Currently, Kim Beazley’s only answer on border protection is a “meet and greet”  coastguard (with an unknown number of boats at an unknown cost) which is no substitute  for strong laws on offshore processing for illegal entrants. 

  The Government is getting on with the job of securing our borders and deterring illegal  entrants, while Labor has shown yet again that it can only come up with cheap one-liners  as a substitute for real policy.
