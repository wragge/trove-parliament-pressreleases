  ACCESS AND EQUITY THE FIRST CASUALTY OF HOWARD'S POLICY 

  John Howard's long awaited launch of his Immigration and Multicultural Affairs policy in  Melbourne tomorrow night ignores a basic principle of multiculturalism -access and equity. 

  "Only three weeks before election day, John Howard is finally promising to deliver some  detail on his stand on migration, ethnic affairs and multicultural policy," the Minister for  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus, said today. 

  "But true to form, Mr Howard is not taking his message to everyone. 

  "Only those who can afford to pay $55 will get access to Mr Howard's long-awaited policy  -there's no equity in this kind of access! 

  "Is he offering any concessions for pensioners, for youth from non-English speaking  background, or for migrant job seekers interested in what he has to say? 

  "If not, what message is he sending them about his plans for access and equity under a  Coalition Government? Is this how he plans to help fund his policies? 

  "Mr Howard is denying fair access to those who are most likely to be the victims of his  economic, social and industrial prejudices -the young, pensioners, migrants on award wages,  migrant job seekers, migrant women at home, and particularly refugees. 

  "Those who have $55 to spare will have a head start in assessing whether Mr Howard does  in fact have any plans for multicultural Australia. 

  "But even they will have precious little time to come to any conclusions, having had nothing  but his appalling record to go on since he became leader of the Opposition. "
