 Michael Keenan 

 Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection  Member for Stirling 

 

 Labor's busted border security invites trouble  15/09/10  

 The Labor Government’s decision to slash resources from port security has severely  weakened our border defences and made the job of foreign drug cartels easier.  

 Earlier this year the Rudd/Gillard Labor Government took the axe to 250 staff from the  Customs and Border Protection Service, the men and women working each day to secure our  borders.  

 They slashed the budget of the Customs and Border Protection Service by $146.3m and cut  further funding from the Australian Federal Police.  

 They also reduced the number of sea cargo inspections by 32,500 and air cargo inspection by  4.7 million.  

 The result has been less maritime security, and more freedom for the operation of drug  cartels.  

 Today’s report of a sudden increase in cocaine seizures is evidence of this, and a sign of  what’s to come now that drug smugglers, like people smugglers, know that this Government  is a soft touch on border protection.  

 Prime Minister Gillard must explain why Ministers have been advised time and again of the  security threats on our wharves and failed to act.  

 You cannot slash funding and personnel from Customs and Border Protection, an agency  already stretched to the limit by the crisis in illegal boat arrivals, and not expect our border  security to be compromised.  

 The Coalition committed to reversing these funding cuts during the election campaign and if  Labor was serious about border security they would do the same.
