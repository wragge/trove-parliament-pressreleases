 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO    

 MEDIA RELEASE  DUTTON’S SEQUEL A STINKER 

 

 The Abbott Government has today announced a new immigration agreement  with Cambodia, just seven months after Scott Morrison sipped champagne to  celebrate a $40 million deal to resettle refugees in the country.    

 The first agreement - which according to the Abbott Government aspired to  resettle up to five people in Cambodia - was a farce, there aren’t any adjectives  left to describe this latest effort.    

 The Abbott Government needs to explain to the Australian people whether a  single refugee currently in Nauru has expressed an interest in relocating to  Cambodia.    

 The community has a right to wonder what on earth happened to the first  agreement and what does this new agreement actually mean?    

 Labor supports greater regional co-operation to tackle people smuggling but the  Abbott Government’s staggering lack of detail on this deal makes it almost  impossible to properly evaluate any merit this arrangement might have.
