 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling ANOTHER ILLEGAL BOAT UNDER THE  GUILTY PARTY ON BORDER PROTECTION August 01, 2013

 The arrival of a boat, with 74 people on board, is another reminder that Labor will always be the guilty party on border protection,  the  party  that  simply  can’t  be  trusted  to  stop  illegal  boat  arrivals,  Shadow  Minister  for  Immigration  and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “Australians  cannot  rid  the  people  smugglers  of  their  business  model,  unless  they  first  get  rid  of  the  guilty  party  that provided it,” Mr Morrison said.

 “That guilty party is Labor and it is led by the same guilty leader who abolished the Howard Government’s strong border  protection policies which started the boats.

 “Regardless of their big, bold promises, Labor’s form is the real indicator of what would happen on the other side of an election and that is more boats and more cost, chaos and tragedy.

 “To stop the boats you have to have the conviction, the determination, form and the backing of your entire party, to  implement the sorts of measures necessary to stop the boats. This is what the Coalition would bring to the table if  elected,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “The month of August has begun exactly how July ended - with a constant flow of illegal boats arriving  on our shore.

 “Last month saw over 4000 people arrive illegally by boat - the biggest month for boat arrivals ever on record. 

 “Since Kevin Rudd took back the Labor leadership there have been up to six illegal boats arrive in just one day, with no  sign of this escalating rate of arrivals stopping under a Labor Government.

 “The people smugglers are refusing to back down and instead will continue to test the resolve of the Labor Party who has  failed to stop them time and time again,” Mr Keenan said.
