 TRANSCRIPT 

 Senator Chris Evans  Leader of the Opposition in the Senate  Shadow Minister for Social Security 

 

 26 May 2005   

 SUBJECT:  Immigration bungle   

 

 EVANS: Thanks for coming this morning.  I want to make a few comments about what  occurred at Estimates Committees last night in the Senate.  I think it was the most  disturbing experience I’ve had in twelve years in politics when the Department of  Immigration revealed that it knew, as early as July 2003, that Ms Alvarez-Solon Young  had been deported by them despite the fact she was an Australian citizen.  They had  known for two years and informed the Queensland Missing Persons Bureau that they  knew they deported this Australian citizen for two years before any action was taken  then her former husband alerted them to the fact.  So, we have the situation where  DIMIA knew for a whole two years that they illegally deported an Australian citizen and  took no action to rectify their error to bring her back from the Philippines or in fact to  ensure her well-being.     

 I think it’s the most scandalous thing I’ve heard and I think it makes the Government’s  defence in their opposition to a Royal Commission totally unstainable.  The Minister  also made clear last night that Mr Palmer will only be involved with these inquiries for  another three weeks.  That he will only effectively deal with one of the now 203 cases  that have been referred to the inquiry and it appears from Lateline information last night  that Mr Palmer will effectively play no more role in the inquiry after he reports on the  Rau case in three weeks time.  That means that he’ll deal only with one of the 203 cases  referred to him and it’s now suggested that even he is supporting the call for a Royal  Commission.   

 The Government must call a Royal Commission.  Their current position is  unsustainable.  They at least admitted yesterday that major reform needs to take place  but the most damning indictment was their own evidence that that department knew  for a full two years that they deported an Australian citizen and did nothing to rectify  the error.  Nothing to save Ms Solon-Young from her fate or to ensure she got proper 

 treatment.   

 JOURNALIST: Would you accept a judicial inquiry into this with Royal Commission  powers if you’re not going to get a Royal Commission?   

 EVANS: I think even the Government now will have to realise that a Royal  Commission is required.  It appears Mr Palmer is now arguing for that.  It’s obvious, that  with 203 cases now referred with the damning evidence last night of systematic failure  to protect Australian citizens a Royal Commission is needed.  It’s also clear that by  involving now Queensland Police and the Missing Persons Bureau that those Officers are  going to want protection before giving evidence.  It’s clear a Royal commission is  needed.  Anything less will leave the Australian public dissatisfied with the result.  And  quite frankly you can’t have a more serious case when the Department read out their  email that admitted they knew in 2003 that they deported an Australian citizen.  As I  say, it was chilling.  It was the most disturbing moment in my twelve years in the  Parliament and I think all Australians will realise that a Royal Commission is required.   The Government’s position is unstainable.  I suspect the only reason there isn’t a Royal  Commission already is, I think, the Government accepts if a Royal Commission is called  Amanda Vanstone’s position is untenable and she’ll have to go.  But, there’s no question  in the public interest a Royal Commission is needed.   

 JOURNALIST: From what you’ve seen so far, do you think heads need to roll at a  Ministerial level and in the Department?   

 EVANS: Clearly, there’s been tremendous failure.  They have failed Australian citizens  on two major occasions and now we know there are 201 more cases that require  serious investigation.  This is probably one of the most serious allegations against a  Government Department in the history of the Commonwealth.  It really does need a  Royal Commission to get to the bottom of it and I think there’s deep community  concern now about whether people are going to be treated properly.   

 JOURNALIST: On Senator Ross Lightfoot he wasn’t commenting this morning on these  claims, (inaudible)   

 EVANS: We have evidence that suggests that Senator Lightfoot has not declared  his share tradings and financial interests in major companies in accordance with the rules  of the Senate.  I will this morning, be referring those matters to the Privileges  Committee in the Senate.  Senator Lightfoot is becoming a serial offender in terms of  the Declaration of Senators’ Interests.  This is a question that is central to our  democracy that the public knows where Members of Parliament are getting their 

 income from, what might be influencing their decisions.  I think if Senator Lightfoot has  failed to properly disclose his interests for a third time then the Senate will take a very  serious view of that.  But, as I say, I’ll be referring these allegations to the Senate  Privileges Committee today for investigation and report but Senator Lightfoot has some  very serious questions to answer.   

 Could I just say something about a couple of the other matters that were revealed last  night?  Some of you may have been tucked up in bed or otherwise engaged.     But first of all, in terms of the Prime Minister’s announcement yesterday that the 

 Vietnamese baby Michael Tran, will not be returned to Christmas Island.   An hour and  a half after the Prime Minister made that statement in the Parliament, Senator Vanstone 

 and her officials were still insisting to me at Estimates that the baby would be retuned to  Christmas Island as soon as the mother and child were well enough to travel.  This was  policy on the run by the Prime Minister.  He made it up under pressure in Question 

 Time yesterday.  The Department assured me in the morning and again in the afternoon  following the Prime Minister’s Question Time, which obviously they hadn’t been  informed about, that following his Question Time answer, an hour and a half later they  were still maintaining that Departmental policy was that the baby, and its mother and  father be returned to detention on Christmas Island.  If one looks at their regulations,  that’s correct.  The decision by the Prime Minister to announce suddenly that they  could stay in Perth, not in detention, is not consistent with any of their regulations or  guidance.  It was policy on the run from a Prime Minister under enormous pressure  about his treatment of refugees.  He didn’t want to have to explain that under the  Government’s policy, the baby would go to prison within days of its birth on a remote  territory.   So, I think that’s an example of how the Government’s under enormous  pressure on this issue.     

 I think the other matter I wanted to mention and I think the media will be particularly  interested in this issue is late last night it became clear that the Government took the  decision not to reveal the name of Ms Alvarez-Solon Young to the media when it  became obvious to them that they deported her.  They in fact decided to keep that  secret as they searched for her, refused to release her details.  They in fact refused to  tell her relatives in Australia and the Philippines that they had deported her even though  the Secretary and the Minister knew from 21st April that that in fact was the case.  And  when they contacted her relatives they continued to pretend that they didn’t know that  they deported her to the Philippines when they inquired whether they had seen her or  not.  So, her half-brother in Australia was contacted and asked whether or not he knew  of her whereabouts when they knew and had known for two years that they deported  her to the Philippines four years earlier.     

 So, these are very serious issues  but the key point that emerged last night is that no  one from the Department of Immigration had spoken to Mr Young, Mrs Young’s former  husband because the Chief of Staff of the Minister, Senator Vanstone, had requested  that the matter be kept secret, they say on the request of Mr Young.  But, the Minister’s  office was the office that was responsible for ensuring that the information that they  were searching for Ms Alvarez-Solon Young was not released to the public.  And it was  only as a result of media inquiries that she was found.  It seems if the media hadn’t  intervened and searched for her, she may still not have been found because for three  weeks the Department had been looking for her but refusing to make any public appeal.   So, when the Minister talks of the culture of the Department, we now see that as late as  early May this year there was still a culture of secrecy, of refusing to be open with the  public.     

 They had known for two years they had deported her, they refused to admit that  mistake but they refused to encourage the media or the public to be involved in the  search for her.  And, quite frankly, if it wasn’t for the media intervening she may never  have been found.  The Minister’s office continued to hold that question secret, the 

 identity of Ms Alvarez-Solon Young and refused to admit that they had deported her.   But, as I say, without the media’s intervention she may never have been found.  But the  Minister’s office had ensured the matter stayed secret and that Ms Solon Young was not 

 found by the Departmental officials because of the secrecy of that investigation.  I think  that’s a very serious matter because it goes to the heart about whether the Minister and  the Government had been open about these matters.  The fact that they were still  trying to cover up the fact of her disappearance some three weeks after they learnt they 

 had deported her I think is a scandal.  And I think the Minister is going to have to be  held accountable for those issues as well.   

 

 

 Ends.
