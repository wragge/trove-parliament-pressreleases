 Human Pressure Cooker Boils Over Again Duncan Kerr - Shadow Minister for Justice

 Media Statement - 31 January 2001

 'The latest incident involving harm to an asylum seeker during unrest in Curtin Detention Centre comes as no surprise,' Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Population, Duncan Kerr, said today.

 Mr Kerr's comments were made in response to reports of the stabbing of an asylum seeker during a riot at Curtin over the weekend.

 'Unrest is bound to occur when asylum seekers are detained for long periods under harsh and impersonal conditions,' Mr Kerr said.

 'These problems are often exacerbated when detainees are held in privatised facilities. A climate of secrecy and the culture of profit in the running of detention facilities is a clear recipe for disaster.

 'Labor has consistently criticised the Government's management of detention facilities for asylum seekers. Labor has consistently called for better accountability and public scrutiny of that management,' he said.

 'The Australian public has the right to know what is happening behind closed doors at Curtin and other detention facilities.

 'That will not happen unless Minister Ruddock establishes an independent judicial inquiry into the conditions in detention centres - with full powers to compel testimony, protect witnesses and subpoena documents. The terms of reference for the Flood Inquiry established late last year (and yet to report) were plainly inadequate to address these broader concerns.

 'Bad systems generate bad outcomes. The Howard government has bungled the outsourcing of IT but wouldn't face up to that fact until an inquiry forced its hand. A full and open inquiry into the outsourcing of detention facilities is long overdue.'
