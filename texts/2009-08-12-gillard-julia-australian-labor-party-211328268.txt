 The Hon Julia Gillard MP 

 Minister for Education. Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations  Minister for Social Inclusion  Deputy Prime Minister

 Speech 

 Speech - Matter of Public Importance 

 Can I say first and foremost: I think Australians deserve a better standard of debate about the  most important issue of education.  

 Can I also say: I think Australians deserve better than a part-time Shadow Education  Minister.  

 It amazes me that if you go to the Member’s website you will find that he has only published  one speech on education this year—that was a speech on the Bradley higher education  reforms.  

 He has not one published speech on schools this year, not one published speech on VET this  year, not one published speech on early childhood education this year. But there are two  published speeches on the Liberal Party.  

 So I think what people can conclude from that is that he cares twice as much about talking to  his Liberal Party colleagues as he does about debating education issues.  

 And the Shadow Minister just said to me, ‘What about the press releases?’  

 Well, if you go to his website you will find that he has put out 41 media releases this year.  So, out of 222 days, he has done an average of one press release every 5.4 days.  

 So once every working week, five days of a working week, he has struggled and managed to  put out one press release—hardly indicative of a Shadow Minister engaged in the education  debate. 

 ‘But,’ I hear you ask, ‘maybe there are volumes and volumes of policies?’ Well, there are not  on the website.  

 And then, if you go to the Education for Australia website, what you find is 182 words under  the heading, ‘Liberal focus on education,’ and most of it is paying homage to a program of  the former Howard Government— not one policy, not one idea for the nation’s future on  education.  

 This is not good enough for the standard of debate and an indication that the Shadow Minister  does not take his job seriously—and clearly he puts very little effort into getting it done.  

 In contrast, the Government is completely focused on delivering our Education Revolution,  which is both a major reform agenda and an unprecedented focus with new resources across  education.  

 Let us go through the elements of the Education Revolution.  

 Of course, true to form, the Shadow Minister has only talked about one—the Building the  Education Revolution program.  

 Well, can I say to the Shadow Minister: the Building the Education Revolution program is the  biggest school modernisation program in the nation’s history, and I welcome debate and  focus on it.  

 But driving an Education Revolution—and making true the promise of the best possible start  in life that this nation should give to every child—actually requires more than that. But let us  just focus for a minute, as the Shadow Minister did, on the question of the Building the  Education Revolution program.  

 I would have to say that I do not think he has got the support of his backbench, because my  attention has been drawn to this journal, published by the Hon. Peter Slipper MP, Federal  Member for Fisher—as we would know, a very longstanding member of the Liberal Party  and a member of the Opposition.  

 I did read it all, of course, but my attention was particularly drawn to the back page: ‘Recent  funding announcements’. Here is a list of recent funding announcements, from Peter Slipper  for Fisher.  

 There we can go through a list of funding announcements—all the Building the Education  Revolution announcements: $200,000 for Beerwah State High School, $75,000 for  Beerburrum State School, $200,000 for Buddina, $200,000 for Maleny, $200,000 for Talara,  $200,000 for Unity College, $200,000 for another school in Caloundra, $75,000 for  Conondale, $125,000 or Delaneys Creek State School… 

 (Christopher Pyne interjects) 

 …$125,000 for Glenview State School, $200,000 for Golden Beach State School, $200,000  for Kawana Waters State College, $125,000 or Kilcoy State High School and $150,000 for  Landsborough State School—claimed by the Member as his own work: an endorsement of  Building the Education Revolution.  

 But can I say to the Member for Fisher that he is not alone in being someone who endorses  Building the Education Revolution.  

 Let us go to the education representatives in this country—the people who have made their  life’s work advocating for schools. What do they say about Building the Education  Revolution?  

 Therese Temby, Chair of the National Catholic Education Commission, says:  

 “The BER funding allocated by the Government is being well spent. Projects are proceeding  according to budget and on time, with maximum use of local project management and local  building contractors.” 

 Those are the words of the person who speaks on behalf of Catholic schools.  

 Then Bill Daniels says: 

 “I can assure you that those associated with 110,000 independent school communities  throughout Australia welcome this additional support and are determined to use the funds  efficiently and effectively.” 

 That is the man who speaks on behalf of independent schools.  

 Then Leonie Trimper, the person who speaks on behalf of primary principals, says:  

 “The Australian Primary Principals Association today reiterated its strong support for the  Federal Government’s $14.7 billion investment for Australia’s 9200 schools. The magnitude  and scope of the Federal Government’s capital investment is unprecedented.” 

 So those who have dedicated their lives to improving the quality of Australia’s education  system endorse Building the Education Revolution.  

 The Shadow Minister comes into this Parliament very frequently long on rhetoric, short on  proof, making unsubstantiated allegations about Building the Education Revolution which he  has mainly lifted from the pages of newspapers, not having done any original research.  

 He should speak to the people who speak on behalf of schools. If he does he will find the  attitudes expressed by the people I have just quoted.  

 More broadly on the Education Revolution, of which Building the Education Revolution is  just one part, today the Education Revolution has drawn some unlikely support.  

 Given that from time to time I have been known in this Parliament to quote the words of the  Australian newspaper not necessarily approvingly, I would today draw the House’s attention  to the editorial of the Australian newspaper, which talks about it being crunch time in  schools, talks about the Rudd Labor Government’s determination on transparency and says:  

 “Ms Gillard has been solid in her determination to lift standards, already doing more in less  than two years than the Coalition did in 11 years.” 

 That is the editorial of the Australian newspaper today.  

 What we did when we came to Government is say to ourselves, ‘Should we try and make sure  that every Australian child gets the best possible start in life and a high-quality education?’  

 We answered that question yes—yes as a matter of equity and yes as a matter of future  economic development for this nation.  

 Then we asked ourselves the question, ‘Can we?’  

 We answered that question yes. If you are prepared to invest in the education of the most  disadvantaged child in this country, you can make sure that child gets a great education and  succeeds at school.  

 Then we said to ourselves, ‘How can we make that difference?’  

 The first thing we realised is that, after more than a decade of neglect and rhetoric by the  former Government, you could not even sit here as a federal government and say, ‘Bring me  a list of the thousand most disadvantaged schools in this country.’ You could not do that as  Federal Education Minister.  

 If you said to the department, ‘Bring me a list of those thousand schools where the kids at  them come from low income families, which teach many Indigenous children, which teach  many children with disabilities, which teach many children from migrant and refugee  backgrounds and which teach kids whose parents themselves did not succeed at school.  Could you bring me that list?’, the answer would be no.  

 After more than a decade of talking about school transparency by the Liberal Party, that  information does not exist.  

 So piece by piece we set about getting those transparency measures so that not only we, the  Government, but the community can see where educational attainment is, where disadvantage  is, and act to make a difference. That is why our transparency measures are so fundamental to  our program.  

 Then those transparency measures will relate to and drive new improvements in educational  quality across the board.  

 What do we know makes a difference to kids’ achievement? It is the quality of teaching.  

 What are we investing in? The quality of teaching.  

 What has this government already achieved? It has achieved, just to start, a system in New  South Wales where the best teachers will be paid more money to go to the worst schools, the  schools that are doing it the toughest. This is a tremendously profound educational reform  delivered by the Education Revolution.  

 What else have we achieved? We have achieved a new way of getting into teaching as a high-performing graduate, which means as a high-performing graduate you can go and help the  most disadvantaged schools by teaching in them. This is, again, a profound reform already in  train from this government.  

 And we have created a new partnership, $1.5 billion to bring new resources to the most  disadvantaged schools to make a difference for them.  

 In addition to those reforms, we have got new investments in literacy and numeracy to make  a difference to those kids who struggle the most with the foundation stones of learning.  

 This comes on top of the work we are doing on a national curriculum to lift standards around  the country.  

 It comes on top of the work we are doing in early childhood education to make sure that kids  come to school ready to learn.  One thing primary school teachers around the country will tell  you is that they can tell the difference in a child who has had a quality preschool program and  comes to school ready to learn.  

 And we are going to make a difference post-school by ensuring new investments into VET,  which we are already making, and of course new investments into universities.  

 We are funding universities in a way which will create a sustainable and long-lasting  partnership between universities and disadvantaged schools.  

 For too long our universities have said, ‘We don’t educate enough students from low  socioeconomic status families because they fail out of the school system, and we can’t fix  that.’  

 We have said to universities, ‘You are amongst the brightest people in the nation. Why don’t  we create an incentive for you to work with the most disadvantaged schools and actually  make a difference to them?’, and we have done that.  

 This is a profound set of reforms right across the educational spectrum. 

 The reforms work with our focus on the kinds of new skills and new learning that children  will need in this century.  

 That is why we have brought the digital Education Revolution to secondary schools. There  are 78,000 new computers already in schools, and a ratio of one to one for senior secondary  students will be achieved in 2011.  

 But the learning skills of the new century will not just be on computers; they will also be in  trades, and many children will choose that pathway.  

 But they are not going to do it in 1950s facilities and that is why we are bringing trades  training centres to each secondary school around the country.  

 Many schools have chosen to cluster and build bigger facilities. This has been misrepresented  by the Opposition as somehow schools missing out. They have chosen to do that. The  entitlement is there for schools to participate in this program over the 10 years of its rollout.  

 It has already made a difference, with the allocations of funds for 432 schools and 138  projects.  

 This is an integrated set of reforms right across our education system, from the education of  our youngest children through to the education of people in universities.  

 It strikes me as amazing that the Liberal Party says it wants to contend to be the Government  of this country but it basically has nothing to say about this profound reform agenda and  certainly has no alternative.  

 The nation deserves better from the Liberal Party than that.
