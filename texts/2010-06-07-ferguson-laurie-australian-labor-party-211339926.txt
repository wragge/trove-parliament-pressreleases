 Laurie Ferguson MP 

 Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement  Services   

 $580 000 to enhance NT settlement services  7 June 2010 

 Promoting integration, inclusion and understanding between refugee women and the  broader community through the exchange of cultural information and events is an  example of the innovative and important work carried out by agencies funded under  the settlement grants program, the Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs  and Settlement Services, Laurie Ferguson, said today. 

 As part of the $580 000 settlement grants program (SGP) funding allocated to the  NT, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) will provide $56 000 to  Darwin Community Arts. 

 'The project delivered by Darwin Community Arts promotes the integration and  inclusion of migrant and refugee women into the Darwin community where  community members will exchange cultural skills such as cooking, sewing, and  storytelling,' Mr Ferguson said. 

 'This project will increase participation between members of diverse cultures and  increase the confidence of new arrivals.'  

 During the 2010-11 financial year, DIAC's settlement grants program will provide  $580 000 towards six projects which will help new arrivals to settle into the NT. 

 'The many projects supported by the settlement grants program will help migrants  and refugees to settle successfully into their new communities, promoting social  participation and assisting with their cultural transition into Australia,' Mr Ferguson  said. 

 Some of the successful applicant organisations include migrant resource centres,  multicultural service agencies and community and welfare organisations.   

 'The many projects supported by the settlement grants program will help migrants  and refugees to settle successfully into their new communities, promoting social  participation and assisting in their cultural transition into Australia,' Mr Ferguson said. 

 A complete list of successful applicants in the 2010-11 funding round is available on  the DIAC website.  See: Settlement Grants Program 

 'I commend all organisations for their contribution to the successful settlement of  migrants and refugees in the NT,' Mr Ferguson said.
