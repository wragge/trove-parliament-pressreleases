  BOLKUS REAFFIRMS COHKITMENT TO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN or ACTION 

  The Minister tor Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Nick  Bolkus,today reaftirmed the Australian Government's undertaking  to investigate any new and substantive evidence ot Vietnamese  asylum seekers having been wrongfully screened out as refugees  under the Comprehensive Plan ot Action. 

  "Over the last 12 months, claims of corrupt practices in refugee  camps in the region have been under close scrutiny by the united  Nations High commissioner,.. for Refugees," Senator Bolkus said. 

  "The High Commissioner herself, Mrs Ogata, has given me her  personal assurance that there is no evidence to suggest that any  individual has been wrongfully denied refugee status.  IINon-Government organisations from the United states have visited  CPA centres and failed to find any cause to revisit the claims  of people who have been screened out as refugees under the CPA  process. 

  "However, as :I have repeatedly advised Vietnamese community  organisations in Australia, I would have no hesitation in  bringing new and SUbstantial evidence to the attention of the  UNHCR. " 

  Senator Bolkus said that since Australia helped establiSh the  Comprehensive Plan ot Action in 1989, Australia had resettled  18,500 Indochinese people who had been screened in as refuqees -the majority of whom were Vietnamese. Another 300 screened in  retuqees will arrive during 1995/96. 

  In addition, the Government has introduced a Special Assistance  Category in its Humanitarian Program for Vietnamese in camps with  close links with Australia. To qualify for the SAC, applicants  must have returned to Vietnam betor~ Jahuary 1 1996, and must  racei ve a written undertakinq of suppor~ from a permanent  resident of Australia. There are 600 places in the SAC for  1995/96, which is also open to Vietnamese from Germany Who have  close family in Australia. 

  ItSince 1980, nearly 47,000 Vietnamese have migrated to Australia  under our Migration Program," Senator Bolkus said. liThe  Government remains committed to an orderly miqration program  which offers people th& opportunity to join their families in  Australia, as it does to the safe and dignified return to Vietnam  of screened-out refugees under the ComprehensivQ plan of Action. 

  "This is in stark contrast with the opposition, which is long on  rhetoric but extremely short on delivery."  CANBERRA OCTOBER 17 1995
