 ABBOTT DOORSTOP - ETS, BORDER PROTECTION, SMALL BUSINESS 

 The Hon Tony Abbott MP  

 Leader of the Opposition 

 E&OE  

 TONY ABBOTT  

 Since he came back from Copenhagen Mr Rudd seems virtually to have been in hiding. I think this is because he 

 can’t explain his Emissions Trading Scheme, he can’t explain why he’s lost control of Australia’s borders and he 

 can’t explain some bad news on the economy. I think it’s high time that Mr Rudd came out of hiding. I think he 

 should engage in a full new year debate with me about the Emissions Trading Scheme - his great big tax on 

 everything. I think he needs to explain to the Australian public what he’s going to do to secure our borders and to 

 stop the flow of boat people. He needs to explain what he’s going to do to ensure that we don’t have a series of 

 interest rate rises this year and more bad news on the economy.  

 QUESTION  

 Mr Abbott, you said that if the Coalition was to win the election you would turn boats back, what do you mean by 

 this?  

 TONY ABBOTT  

 What I’ve said is that there are four elements to effective border protection. First, you’ve got to have good 

 relations with the source countries. Second, you’ve got to have rigorous offshore processing. Third, you’ve got to 

 have a temporary visa so that people who come in an unauthorised way don’t necessarily win the great prize of 

 permanent residency in Australia. And fourth, in the right circumstances you’ve got to be prepared to turn boats 

 around.  

 Now, Mr Rudd said that he would do this prior to the last election. He hasn’t had the steel to do this since he’s 

 been Prime Minister.  

 QUESTION  

 How will that work though? Will customs vessels and navy ships literally turn the boats back at sea?  

 TONY ABBOTT  

 Well, that’s a matter for the Government, but Mr Rudd said that he would have the steel to do this. He has not 

 shown that steel, he has not shown that guts since becoming Prime Minister.  

 QUESTION  

 Isn’t turning the boats back though a breach of international law? The Refugee Council of Australia is saying it is.  

 TONY ABBOTT  

 What Australia needs to do is to protect its own borders and to act in its national interest. This is something that’s 

 been done before, it’s something that’s been done by comparable countries and if we are to fully protect our 

 borders we can’t rule it out.  

 QUESTION  

 Some refugee advocates are saying that this could endanger lives, it would force refugees into taking some more 

 drastic action.  

 TONY ABBOTT  

 What endangers lives is contracting out Australia’s immigration program to people smugglers. What endangers 

 lives is doing anything that encourages people to take to the sea in leaky boats.  

 QUESTION  

 A former Liberal Party Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, said this morning that this is a policy of the past, that it’s a 

 denial of obligations. How do you feel about being criticised by a former PM from your party?  

 TONY ABBOTT  

 Well, my position is the same position that Kevin Rudd took prior to the last election but hasn’t had the guts to act 

 upon once in office and that’s who my argument is with. My argument is with Kevin Rudd.  

 QUESTION  

 Mr Fraser says though that it’s a policy from the 1930’s. Shouldn’t we be moving on?  

 TONY ABBOTT  

 Well, as I said, my position is the same as Kevin Rudd took prior to the election but hasn’t had the guts to act 

 upon in Government.  

 QUESTION  

 What’s wrong with taking asylum seekers? Why are you so against taking asylum seekers?  

 TONY ABBOTT  

 There’s nothing wrong with a significant humanitarian immigration program. Australia has long had such a 

 program and I think that we should continue that program. But once you lose control of your borders you are 

 letting down all of those people who are playing by the rules, including potential refugees and potential 

 humanitarian entrants.  

 QUESTION  

 Has Kevin Rudd’s treatment of asylum seekers affected his popularity?  

 TONY ABBOTT  

 Look, I’ll leave that to the pollsters to judge but certainly I think it has undermined his credentials to claim to have 

 been a strong Prime Minister.  

 QUESTION  

 Mr Abbott, tomorrow the Fair Work legislation comes into effect. How do you think this will affect businesses and 

 workers?  

 TONY ABBOTT  

 I think it’s going to be an unhappy new year for small business in particular. There’s a lot of red tape under 

 Labor’s new laws. There’s going to be a lot more strong-arm tactics from the union movement. So, I think that it’s 

 not a new year that Australian small business can much look forward to.  

 QUESTION  

 The other thing is I suppose that many small businesses say that they haven’t had enough consultation with the 

 new laws coming into effect.  

 TONY ABBOTT  

 One of the many unmet promises of this Government is that there would be an education program for small 

 business. Now, there hasn’t been an education program. There hasn’t been consultation and many of these new 

 modern awards still haven’t been finalised and they’re going to have retrospective effects. So I think there’s an 

 enormous amount of confusion, an enormous amount of red tape and the prospect of small business being 

 prosecuted for error that haven’t even been determined yet.
