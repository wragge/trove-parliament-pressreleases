 Australia boosts refugee relief fund in Boznia-Herzegovina

 The Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, John Kerin, has expressed grave concern at the continuing violence in Boznia-Herzegovina and the suffering experienced by the civilian population.

 Mr Kerin announced that in response to the deteriorating conditions Australia would provide an additional $100,000 to assist refugees.

 Mr Kerin said the contribution was in response to a call from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for the international community to support a revised UN combined agencies appeal.

 "The total number of displaced people in the former Yugoslav republics is now more than one million and the situation is grave," Mr Kerin said.

 "With the massive exodus generated by the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina the UN appeal now has a substantial shortfall of funds needed to provide the basic needs of food, shelter and protection for the internal refugees.

 "While European donors are best placed to support the UN appeal, Australia's further contribution recognises our strong community links with the region," Mr Kerin said.

 Mr Kerin also repeated the Government's call for the other republics and the Yugoslav National Army to stop interfering in the internal affairs of Boznia-Herzegovina.

 The latest cash grant brings to $550,000 Australia's response so far in support of emergency funds for the victims of the Yugoslav crisis.

 The emergency relief is provided through funds managed by Australia's overseas aid agency, AIDAB.
