  Mark Vaile - Trade Minister Deputy Leader of the National Party Doorstop interview with Trade Minister Mark Vaile at the Presidential Palace, Jakarta, 15 Feb O111, W.OOam. Question: How did the talks go with the President? Mr Vaile: The meeting that we have just had with President Wahid and my Ministerial counterpart Luhut Panjaitan have gone very well this morning - as did my meeting with President Wahid in August last year. Very warm and very friendly in terms of the issues we needed to discuss. Certainly top of the agenda this visit is my leading an investment delegation from Australia to Indonesia of significant importance and size. We’ve got representatives of 16 Australian companies with us in this mission to Indonesia that collectively Ihave about $6 billion worth of investment alrea,dy in Indonesia and are looking at a further $1.3 billion worth of Investment in Indonesia. The business delegation also had the opportunity of /meeting with the President and discussing a number of issues in terms of the economic relationship between our two countries. And as we take that forward, of course, the overwhelmiiTg emphasis of this visit is all about the economic relationship between our two countl*ies. During the course of the discussions with the President he has reaffirmed that he will be visiting Australia during April. I have also reaffirmed the invitation of the Prime Minister and the Glzvernor General to come to Australia and that that vnsit will have the status of a s’tate visit to Australia. President Wahid indicated to us that he thought very clearly that after something like 13 prime ministerial visits from Australia to Indonesia since the last Presidential visit to Australia it was time that Indonesia reciprocated and the Piresident of Indonesia visited Australia and he fully intends to do so. Question: There have obviously been impediments to the relationship over the last 18 months or so. Did you talk specifically about East Timor about refugees, about ongoing situations between the three countries? Mr Vaile: We discussed a range of issues in terms of what is going on in our region and of course we have always maintained, at a business level and politically, a professional attitude towards the relationship. I think as was said this morning - it has never really been off- track. We are continuing to focus absolutely on the future and the President and his government here in Indonesia is focussing on not just the political stability but the economic stability in Indonesia and in the region. Of course, Australia’s investment and trade relationship with Indonesia is vital to that, and the size of thal investment and trade relationship is very, very significant in terms of the region,, and in terms of Indonesia’s economy. Question: Are you seeking some kind of clarificaltion on new and emerging laws in the country? For instance, regional autonomy which is very vexed and causing great concern especially lo say, the mining industry? Mr Vaile: Where the Indonesian side is keen to attract more foreign direct investment into Indonesia in all sectors, and in a lot of cases doing that in joint-venture arrangements with Indonesiar counterparts, Indonesian companies, of course tine issues of security, certainty and a properly structured financial system and legal system are very important. And they are issues that we discuss at length and continue to address in Australia and of course our business representatives as well as ourselves will continue to discuss those with our colleagues and counterparts here in Indonesia. They ‘are important elements for ongoing Parli amenl. House, Canberra 2600 Ph: +612 6277 74120 Fx: +612 6273 4128 

  investment. Of course that is recognised on the Indonesian side. So we will work through a 

  number of those issues in a very professional way. We will work through it togetlher, both at a   business level and a political level. 

  Question: Have you made a decisi on yet on 

  preferences witt7 One Nation at the next election?   whether or not you will exchange 

  Mr Vaile: I don’t think that’s an issue that we need to address here in Jakarta when we   have such a very healthy relationship going. I think it needs to be said that obviously we   absolutely oppose those policies espoused by some in Australia that are going to have any   detrimental e’ifect on our economic and trading relationship with our major partm?rs in the 

  region. We will continue to oppose those policies and those domestic issues we will leave for   back in Australia. 

  Question: Does the Government of Indonesia, especially President Wahid, guarantee that   investors will be protected in a security situation? 

  Mr Vaile: That’s a commercial decision that a lot of Australian companies will make as   they pursue those investment opportunities. But, of course, what has been clearly indicated to   us this mornil7g is there is an absolute focus by the Government to establish tholse structures, 

  both financial and legal, within Indonesia to create an environment of certainty and security   for investment, both domestically and in foreign direct investment in Indonesia. It is vitally   important, and is recognised as being vitally important, for the ‘iuture development and   expansion of the Indonesian economy and of course that is going to be to the benefit of all 

  Indonesians In terms of job opportunities and the economic development of the country. 

  Question: Do you think that the rise of One Nation once again will effect the trade   relationship between Indonesia and Australia? 

  Mr Vaile: Well I think that we have made it very clear over the years, and again now,   that the views held by some in Australia are not the views of the majority. But at the some   time, we recognise, in a democracy the ability of individuals to express those views as we see   some views Ihat are not necessarily agreed upon by the government expressed here in 

  Indonesia. That opportunity exists in a robust democracy, but certainly we believe that 

  those 

  views could be detrimental, if they were turned in policy as far is Australia is concerned. We   will continue to oppose those views, as we have done in the past, and we will do in the future. 

  Question:   continue to   C   Are you speaking 

  ppose those views?   on behalf of the national Party when you say you will 

  Mr Vaile: I believe, as a Minister for Australia, I spea.k 0’1 behalf of all Australians as I   travel oversesas, representing the interests of Australians in whatever sector of the community   or whatever sector of the economy, in terms of continuing to expand our trade and export   opportunities, and expand our investment opportunities globally - but more importantly, with 

  regard to this visit, within our region, where we have significant interests in this region and   particularly in Indonesia. We have significant interests in terms of exports and particularly in   terms of investments within Indonesia and in partnership with Indonesian companies. We   need to make those points very, very clear. So, I do represent Australia in my capacity as 

  Australia’s Trade Minister here in Indonesia on this visit. 

  Question: Can you speak for a.11 members of the National Party though? 

  Mr Vaile: Yes I can, because we absolutely remain comcnitkd to what we have done in recent   years in expanding our export capabilities. We have seen in quantum exports from Australia increase   from $119 billion to $126 billion to the year 2000, $142 billion. Overwhelmingly that benefits regional   Australia. It generates between 1.7 and :2 million jobs in Austraha. One in five jobs acrloss the   economy. But, more importantly in regional Australia, those areas that members of the National Party 

  represent, one in four jobs in regional Australia rely heavily on expc~rts so our partners in the region   and more broadky across the world are of absolute vital importance.   Contact: James Baker (Ministerial) 02 4277 7420 mobile 0418 273 475
