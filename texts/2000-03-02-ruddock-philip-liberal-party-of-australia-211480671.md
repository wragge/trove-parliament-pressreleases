 No Influx Planned for Shepparton MPS 025/2000 

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, gave assurances today that his Department had no plans to send 1,000 former boat people to the Shepparton area in coming weeks.

 "The suggestion that a large number of people would be sent to the area appear to be based solely on the speculation of individuals who have travelled to the region," Mr Ruddock said.

 "My Department has no plans to settle such a large number of refugee arrivals in a regional location in the short space of time being suggested.

 "In fact, we are working to ensure there is a wide dispersal of people who are granted temporary protection visas because we want to ensure there is not an uneven impact on communities around Australia.

 "People who are found to have a lawful right to remain in Australia will not be encouraged to travel to areas where accommodation and other relevant services are not available," Mr Ruddock said.
