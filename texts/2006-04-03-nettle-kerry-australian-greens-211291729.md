 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales 

 

 Nettle welcomes West Papuans and calls for remaining asylum seeker to  be brought to mainland 

 Senator Nettle, 3rd April 2006   

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today called on the Minister for Immigration Senator  Amanda Vanstone to bring the remaining West Papuan asylum seeker to Melbourne  whilst his asylum claim continues to be assessed.    

 "To leave this man alone on Christmas Island is unacceptable. There is no reason why  this man cannot have his claim assessed in Melbourne where he can have access to  fellow West Papuans," Senator Nettle said.    

 "This man has faced the same persecution as his fellow West Papuans. For him to be  separated from the others for what appear to be technical legal reasons is exactly the  kind of bureaucratic insensitivity that has left Australia's immigration reputation in  tatters.    

 Senator Nettle welcomed the 42 West Papuan refugees to the Australian mainland.    

 "The arrival of these brave neighbours is great news for them but also great news for  their fellow West Papuans who will now have more friends in Australia to publicise  their plight.    

 "I look forward to meeting them all again soon, and continuing to raise the profile of  the dire situation in West Papua which led to their escape to Australia.    

 "The Greens wish them well in their new lives in Australia and in their struggle for  justice in West Papua."
