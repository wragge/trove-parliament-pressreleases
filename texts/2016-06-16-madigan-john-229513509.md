 Senator John Madigan  Independent Senator for Victoria 

  ï¿½rï¿½rï¿½r ï¿½ Media Releaseï¿½ ï¿½rï¿½rï¿½rï¿½ NOVEL BACTERIA FOUND IN AUSTRALIAN TICKS 

  Manufacturing and Farming Party Senator for Victoria John Madigan has welcomed the release of 

  a research paper announcing the discovery of a novel Borrelia species in Australian ticks.

  “I r



  eceived news on Tuesday that Australian researchers have detected Borrelia bacteria in ticks 

  found on Australian echidnas.” Senator Madigan said. “An unbelievable 39% of the ticks tested 

  were found to be carriers.” 

  This 



  latest research suggests what many Australians have suspected and that is, that Australian 

  ticks may be responsible for making thousands of Australians sick with a Lyme-like illness.  

  Before 



  the dissolution of parliament, a Senate committee, initiated by Senator Madigan, inquiring 

  into the growing evidence of an emerging tick-borne disease received over 1200 submissions. 

  The great majority of evidence that the committee received was from sick Australians who are 

  desperate for answers.  

  The st



  udy provides hope to the many Australians who are currently at home, fighting this 

  debilitating illness, with many denied access to treatment and ignored by Australian health 

  officials.  

  “These l



  atest findings are of significant public health importance to humans, domestic animals and 

  wildlife and urgent research is required to ascertain the effects this Borrelia species might have 

  on human health.” Senator Madigan said. 

  “The dev



  astation and desperation that Lyme-like disease sufferers face should be enough in itself 

  to prompt further research and eventually, recognition. Unfortunately, it hasn’t and these people 

  remain medical refugees in their own country.”  

  Senator 



  Madigan called on the Federal Minister for Health, Sussan Ley, to initiate further research 

  and adopt a national Lyme treatment program as a matter of urgency.  

  “Once 



  this disease is accepted, it can be diagnosed. Once it is diagnosed, it can be treated. It is 

  time to end the unnecessary suffering of Australians who are inflicted with a Lyme-like illness.”
