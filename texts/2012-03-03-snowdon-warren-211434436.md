 AUSTRALIA REMEMBERS THE ATTACK ON BROOME   

 The Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Warren Snowdon, has called on all Australians to reflect on  the 70th anniversary of the bombing of Broome.   

 “Just 12 days after the first bombs fell on Darwin, Japanese fighters turned their focus to the  west, attacking the harbour and airfield,” Mr Snowdon said.   

 At least 80 people were killed in the attack, the majority of whom were Dutch refugees fleeing  the Japanese advance through what was then the Netherlands East Indies (Indonesia).    

 “The Dutch refugees were onboard flying boats which were attacked and sunk in Roebuck Bay,  where they remain to this day,” Mr Snowdon said.   

 “Also killed were US servicemen whose aircraft, carrying 33 passengers and crew, was shot  down by Japanese fighters.”   

 “As a nation, we should all pay tribute to the veterans, survivors and people of Broome, who  stood together in the face of enemy attacks, showing great courage and strength.”   

 Australia’s north suffered 97 bombing raids by the Japanese during the Second World War,  from Broome, Wyndham, Port Hedland and Derby in the west, to Townsville and Cape York in  the east.
