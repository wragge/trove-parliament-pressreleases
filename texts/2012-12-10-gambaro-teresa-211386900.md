 Media Release

 Bowen must come clean on real costs of Manus Island aid package   

 Federal Member for Brisbane and Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for International Development  Assistance Teresa Gambaro has called on Immigration Minister Chris Bowen to come clean on where  the money is coming from as well as the real costs of the Australian Government’s recently  announced aid package to Manus Island after failing to provide costing details of the total package.   

 Ms Gambaro said there were real concerns Australia’s overseas development assistance (ODA)  program was being hijacked to cover Labor’s catastrophic border protection policy failures and that  absolute transparency around all costs associated with the Manus Island aid package was  imperative.   

 “Less than 18 months after the Independent Review of Aid Effectiveness, which called for greater  transparency and accountability in the spending of Australia’s $5 billion aid budget, what we are  seeing with this announcement is more secrecy and a continuing commitment to policy on the run  with an open chequebook funded by Australian taxpayers.”   

 Ms Gambaro said that beyond the catastrophic loss of life and inability to discourage people  smugglers, Labor’s border protection failures equated to a $6.6 billion budget blow out since  2009/10, which did not include the additional $1.3 billion required to increase Australia’s refugee  and humanitarian intake to 20,000 (up from 13,750) as part of the Houston Report’s  recommendations.   

 Ms Gambaro also called on Labor backbenchers to seek assurances from Treasurer Wayne Swan that  additional costs associated with the construction of detention housing or the staffing of centres at  Manus Island and Nauru were not being funded by siphoning off money out of the aid budget.   

 “NSW Labor MP Janelle Safin was reported in the media in October as stating that any reallocation  of Australia’s aid fund along these lines should be considered a cut, while another was reported as  saying such a process would be ‘hypocritical’. Well, where are they now? Why aren’t they asking Mr  Bowen and Mr Swan the difficult questions and calling for the Government to come clean on just  how much money it is ripping out of the aid budget to clean up its border protection mess? Also, the  fact that it was Mr Bowen and not Mr Carr who made this aid announcement for Manus Island  seems to confirm that aid money has been switched to the immigration portfolio.”   

 Ms Gambaro pointed out that in 2012/13 Australia has committed to spending $491.7 million ODA  program in Papua New Guinea consisting of a $443.3 million bilateral program, with regional and  global AusAID-managed initiatives receiving $28.3 million and other Australian Government  Departments managing $19.1 million. Australia’s development assistance to Nauru in 2012/13 was  to be $31.6 million.
