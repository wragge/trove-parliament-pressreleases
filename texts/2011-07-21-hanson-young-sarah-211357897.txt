 Greens’ statement on Christmas Island unrest 

 The Australian Greens say they do not condone the latest violence on Christmas Island and will let the  criminal justice system run its course in dealing with people accused of such acts. 

 “Once again, neither the government nor opposition are taking seriously the causes behind the unrest,  which are the lengths of detention and lack of information to asylum seekers about their applications,”  Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, said today. 

 “There is no reason why someone has to remain incarcerated for up to 15 months with no  communication about the status of their application. 

 “We need to stop forcing people to breaking point and reverse the damage we are causing vulnerable  people by imposing time limits on their detention and releasing all children and families into the  community. 

 “I fear for the more than 400 people in indefinite detention on Christmas Island, including the latest  arrival of 52 asylum seekers today, who are facing expulsion to another country. 

 “Their fate remains as opaque as ever because there is no deal to send them to Malaysia, Manus Island  or anywhere else. 

 “The government should immediately start processing the claims of all those who people who have  arrived after May 7 with a view to resettling those in genuine need of protection.”
