  DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE

  FOREIGN MINISTER ALEXANDER DOWNER

  

  DOOR-STOP, MELBOURNE, 13 APRIL 1999

  

  YUGOSLAVIA: CAPTURED AUSTRALIAN AID WORKERS

  

  Mr Downer: 

  

 Our Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Mr Lamb, has been summonsed 
to the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry during the course of this afternoon 
and he’s been given a Third Person Note by the Yugoslav Government 
in relation to Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace. I’m shocked and angered 
at the views relayed in that Third Person Note that the Yugoslav authorities 
have initiated court proceedings against the CARE employees, Steve Pratt 
and Peter Wallace, for alleged involvement in spying activities in Yugoslavia. 
I’m outraged that there is still no consular access after two weeks 
since they have been apprehended.

  

 The allegations that they have been spying are, as 
I made clear yesterday, simply preposterous, and so is the attack on 
the credibility of CARE Australia made by the Yugoslav Government. I’m 
also astonished that the Yugoslav Government has stated in its Note 
to our Ambassador, that Australia should restrain, in the future, from 
similar activities which could damage the relationship between our two 
countries.

  

 I totally reject this insinuation that Australia, 
that somehow, Australia has been involved in improper activities in 
Yugoslavia. I demand, again, immediate consular access to Mr Pratt and 
Mr Wallace and their release from this totally unjustified detention.

  

 I’m arranging, this evening, for my Department to 
summonse the Yugoslav Ambassador to express our very deep concern about 
these developments, and to demand, yet again, the immediate release 
of the two Australians.

  

 I’ve also spoken this evening, on the telephone, 
to Malcolm Fraser, the Chairman of CARE Australia, who is, at the moment, 
in Moscow, making representations to the Russian Government. I’ve 
asked Mr Fraser if he would be prepared to go to Belgrade, if we could 
arrange for a visa for him get into Yugoslavia, and for him to meet 
with the Yugoslav authorities, and explain to them that CARE Australia 
is nothing but a humanitarian organisation providing compassionate assistance 
to people in need in Yugoslavia and, indeed, in many other parts of 
the world. Mr Fraser has agreed to undertake this mission and so we 
have begun the process now of trying to obtain a visa for him to go 
to Yugoslavia.

  

 I am aware, of course, that the (indistinct) of Australian 
personnel in Yugoslavia but, nevertheless, the Australian Government 
is determined to do everything it possibly can to get Steve Pratt and 
Peter Wallace released from the detention that they are currently in. 
This whole exercise is, in our view, little short of a disgrace, and, 
I think, reflects very badly on President Milosevic and on his government. 
The Australian concerns, I know, will be shared by many countries around 
the world.

  

  Q:

  

 What details do you have of the charges against them?

  

  Mr Downer:

  

 Well, we have -only from the Note that’s been given 
to us by the Foreign

 Ministry - the very simple allegation that Steve Pratt 
and Peter Wallace have been spying, and it is implied in the Note that 
they have been apparently spying for the Australian Government. This 
is absolutely and totally untrue.

  

  Q :

  

 Minister, do you know what the penalty is for spying 
in Yugoslavia?

  

  Mr Downer : 

  

 No, we don’t know what the penalty is but, in any 
country, the penalty for spying is, clearly, a very severe penalty. 
We will be doing everything we possibly can to get these innocent Australian 
men released from - not just from prison in Yugoslavia but from Yugoslavia.

  

  Q: 

  

 (Indistinct)…the Yugoslav Ambassador to the United 
Nations accused Steve Pratt of being the head of a network of spies 
operating even before the bombing began?

  

  Mr Downer : 

  

 Well, this sort of allegation is simply ludicrous, 
and I think it gets.. .The only question those sort of allegations really 
beg is why those kinds of preposterous allegations are being made. We 
can only conclude that the government of President Milosevic is determined 
to discredit aid organisations and aid workers in general in Yugoslavia, 
and that is a very cynical and a very heartless and a very negative 
thing to do, and it will be condemned by the international community. 
The fact is that, at the end of the day, this sort of propaganda activity 
by the Yugoslav Government only confirms the worst fears that the international 
community has of the behaviour of the Yugoslav Government.

  

  Q:

  

 Do you have fears over the likelihood of a fair trial, 
or a fair hearing of these allegations?

  

  Mr Downer: 

  

 Oh, we obviously have very deep fears about the likelihood 
of a fair trial. Given that these charges have just been concocted against 
these two Australians the chances of there being a fair trial are, clearly, 
not going to be very high.

  

  Q :

  

 The Yugoslav Ambassador at the United Nations went 
on to say that the matter could be more easily handled if the bombing 
stopped. What does that mean?

  

  Mr Downer : 

  

 Well, I don’t doubt that these two Australians are 
part and parcel of a general propaganda effort by the Yugoslavia Government 
to diminish the reputation of international aid organisations working 
in Yugoslavia. They, obviously, also are trying to use these two Australians, 
as they are the three American soldiers, who they hold in detention, 
as some sort of leverage against the NATO bombing. But, nobody is going 
to be persuaded or impressed, with these sorts of blackmail tactics. 
Really, I mean, in the 1990’s, you w9uld have hoped that governments, 
if not everybody, but governments, would have moved on from these sorts 
of abominable tactics.

  

  Q :

  

 How difficult does it make it to secure their release, 
or to secure a fair hearing, without having diplomatic (indistinct)?

  

  Mr Downer : 

  

 Well, that’s right. We have, first of all, made 
the point, - which is not really what you’re asking but is the opportunity 
to make the point - we’ve made the point that there isn’t much point 
in severing diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia because we want to 
be able to keep our embassy open there and people on the ground in Yugoslavia; 
and, secondly, under international law, which the Yugoslav government 
love to quote, the Australian Government is entitled to access to Australians 
who are held in detention in Yugoslavia, or, for that matter, anywhere 
else in the world. It’s one of the fundamental tenets of the Vienna 
Convention and so, consistent with international law, which the Yugoslav 
government likes to quote, they should allow immediate access by the 
Australian Embassy, to the two Australians.

  

  Q : 

  

 Minister, if it comes to it, will the Australian Government 
be funding the legal defence?

  

  Mr Downer : 

  

 Well, I really haven’t got through to thinking of 
the details of the cost of the defence. I think the first point I’d 
make to you is we have a very real concern about the credibility of 
any trial when you consider the charges that have been laid against 
the two Australians. I mean, the fact is they wouldn’t have charged 
them if they didn’t want to use them for some propaganda purposes. 
And, given the propaganda purposes they’re using the two Australians 
for, they’re presumably operating on the basis some independent court 
will not acquit them. They’re obviously operating on that assumption. 
Of course, before any fair, independent, impartial court these two Australians 
would be acquitted. Of course they would be because they’re both completely 
innocent. And it’s the innocence which is, of course, one of the factors 
which causes us so much anger - that here are two people that only want 
to provide humanitarian assistance to cessions of Yugoslavia and the 
Yugoslav government incarcerated them. It produces trumped-up charges 
against them, all for propaganda purposes, and that is something that 
I very roundly condemn.

  

  Q : 

  

 Is your Department keeping in contact with the detainees 
families, in regard to keeping them up to speed with what’s going 
on?

  

  Mr Downer :

  

 We maintain contact with the families fairly constantly. 
Yes, we certainly do that. But, I would just like to say that one of 
the families had to move out of their house and into a hotel - I think 
either today or yesterday - in order to escape from constant questioning, 
telephone calls and the like, from the media. So, I would ask the media 
if they could respect the difficult times that the families are going 
through and the sensitivity - and show some sensitivity towards the 
families.

  

  Q :

  

  Minister, looking to the war more generally, do you accept that the 
longer the  bombing goes on the more likely it is there’ll be 
a ground war involving NATO troops on the ground?

  

  Mr Downer :

  

 Well, I’m not sure I’d draw that conclusion. There 
will, in the end, I believe, be some NATO presence on the ground but 
that, of course, has always been NATO’s intention - that they would 
have a peacekeeping force once there was peace in Kosovo to protect 
the Kosovar citizens, in particular, obviously, the Albanian Kosovars. 
Whether there will be some sort of peace-enforcement force on the ground 
is another question. Look, we try not to give gratuitous advice to NATO 
over something like that. That’s a sensitive issue.

  

  Q:

  

 Is there a place for Australian troops in that sort 
of arrangement?

  

  Mr Downer: 

  

 No. We are not involved in the bombing of Yugoslavia, 
nor do have the intention of sending any ground troops to Yugoslavia. 
And, of course that’s what is particularly irritating about this whole 
exercise. Neither Pratt nor Wallace are American, nor, for that matter, 
NATO citizens. They are Australian citizens and Australia is not one 
of the countries that is bombing Yugoslavia. Yet Australians are being 
used for propaganda purposes. So, the Yugoslav Government is, inevitably, 
unhappy with NATO countries but it is spreading international discontent 
about the Yugoslav government. It is spreading international abhorrence 
about what the Yugoslav Government is doing in Kosovo, as well as its 
whole approach to humanitarianism, by seizing two Australians and simply 
using them for some grotesque propaganda purpose.

  

  Q : 

  

 What, exactly, do you hope Mr Fraser will do?

  

  Mr Downer : 

  

 Well, Mr Fraser is the Chairman of CARE Australia, 
as you know, so our interest in getting Mr Fraser into Belgrade to talk 
to the Yugoslav authorities, is for him to be able to explain to them 
the completely apolitical and humanitarian nature of Care Australia, 
and, for that matter, CARE International. CARE Australia is not used 
as a front for intelligence activities. It is not used as a front for 
political activities. I mean, I am the Foreign Minister of Australia. 
I obviously would know if there had ever been any intention to use CARE 
Australia for those sorts of activities. And there has never been such 
an intention to use CARE Australia for those sorts activities - certainly 
in the time I’ve been Foreign Minister, and, I believe, never at any 
time in Australian history has CARE Australia been used for those sorts 
of activities. Now, Mr Fraser, as the Chair of CARE Australia, will 
be able to explain that, face to face, with the Yugoslav authorities 
and we are going to continue to argue our case with the Yugoslav authorities 
until they release the two Australians.

  

  Q : 

  

 (Indistinct)

  

  Mr Downer: 

  

 Well, I’m not blaming Russia for this and this is 
not the responsibility - I know you’re not asking that - but this 
is not the responsibility of the Russian Government. I, myself, have 
written to the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Ivanov, and I’ve asked 
Mr Ivanov if he would be prepared to assist in getting the Australians 
released, and Mr Fraser' visit to Russia which is being facilitated 
by our Embassy in Moscow I hope, will encourage the Russians to be even 
more active than they have been up until now on this issue. But this 
issue isn’t just a big issue here in Australia which, inevitably, 
it is, because Pratt and Wallace are both Australians, but this is a 
major international issue. I think it would be in Russia’s interest 
to provide assistance and Mr Fraser has got a positive hearing, I understand, 
from my conversation with him tonight, from the Russians that he’s 
spoken to so far, and he has other appointments lined up during the 
course of the day.

  

  Q : 

  

 How do think this is going to end up?

  

  Mr Downer: 

  

 Well, I can only tell you how it should end up. It 
should end up with the Australians released. It should end up with the 
three American soldiers released, although they’re an entirely separate 
case. And it should end up with the Albanian Kosvars safe to return 
to their own homes and for peace to be restored in Kosovo and throughout 
Yugoslavia. That’s how it should end up. And almost everybody on earth, 
almost all of the six billion people on earth ,think that is the outcome 
that should be achieved. Well, at the end, whether this is what happens 
or not, will be entirely a matter for President Milosevic. I would have 
thought by now President Milosevic should have begun to understand the 
e4ormous damage that his policies are doing to his own people.

  

  Q :

  

 How soon, do think, the Australians will appear in 
court?

  

  Mr Downer:

  

  I don’t know the answer to that but, presumably, that will happen 
fairly soon. But we don’t know. We’ve been given no information. 
We’ve been given no information about the court  proceedings, 
nor for that matter, have we been given any information about where, 
precisely, in Yugoslavia they are.

  

  Mr Downer :

  

 Well, I’m not, either, entirely sure of the details 
of the Yugoslav court system, but I’ve already expressed my grave 
reservations about any opportunity that they would have of a fair trial 
in an independent legal system. These trumped-up charges wouldn’t 
have been put together by the Yugoslav Government if they thought that 
a court was going to act with independence and acquit them. But any 
independent court in Yugoslavia would acquit them because an independent 
court , looking at evidence, would always acquit innocent people.

  

  Q : 

  

 How is the meeting likely to take place between the 
Yugoslav Ambassador…(indistinct)

  

  Mr Downer: 

  

 Well, during the course of this evening. I think that’s 
happening at about eleven o’clock this evening. I haven’t heard 
back from my Department, but that was the plan.

  

  Q : 

  

 Just one more question, Mr Downer. For how long do 
we accept the two being detained and what are the options once that 
point in time has passed?

  

  Mr Downer : 

  

 Well, we don’t accept them being detained. We don’t 
accept it now. We didn’t accept them being detained for one minute 
and they’ve been detained now, for two weeks. All we can do at the 
end of the day is continue to apply diplomatic pressure to the Yugoslav 
Government. But we’re dealing here with a government which is prepared 
to undertake ethnic cleansing against its own people, which is a pretty 
horrific thing for any government to do. So, we’re not dealing with 
a government which has shown that it’s prepared to accept the norms 
of humane and decent behaviour.

  

  Q : 

  

 Mr Milosevic might argue, of course, that his country 
is suffering a NATO bombing attack.

  

  Mr Downer: 

  

 Well it is suffering a NATO bombing attack... (Indistinct 
interjection)... Well, there are two things about that. It is, of course 
suffering a NATO bombing attack, and it’s suffering a NATO bombing 
attack because of President Milosevic’s appalling abuses of human 
rights in Kosovo. And to ask Western countries, after all they’ve 
been through during the course of the twentieth century, to turn a blind 
eye to that, is to ask too much of humane and decent people. The second 
thing, though, is that Australia is not bombing Yugoslavia. Australia 
does not have ground troops heading for Yugoslavia. Australia itself, 
is not part of the war.

  

 (Interjection: It supported the bombing)

  

  Mr Downer : 

  

 We certainly, diplomatically, support. We’ll always 
support human rights and humanitarianism and I don’t think it’s 
just the Australian Government, by tile way. I think just about everybody 
in Australia has been, simply, appalled at what has happened to the 
Albanian Kosovars over the last few months. They’ve been, simply, 
appalled and the Australian people would expect their government to 
express its outrage about those sorts of human rights abuses. But, many 
governments around the world have expressed the sentiments that we have 
expressed and those governments are not direct participants in this 
conflict and it is particularly preposterous, that Australians should 
be taken in this sort of a way and used for propaganda purposes when 
Australia is not a country which is bombing Yugoslavia.

  

  Q: 

  

 Mr Downer, do you have anything further about the 
refugees and whether Australia will be taking them?

  

  Mr Downer: 

  

 I have no new information for you on that and we will 
be waiting to hear from the United Nations High Commission, and, indeed, 
the High Commissioner herself, before we can say anything more about 
that. We’re leaving that to her and her team to look at and to assess. 
She was saying the other day that she thought that it would be possible 
to cope with the provision of shelter and food and medical facilities 
in Albania and Macedonia and it wouldn’t, at least in the immediate 
future, be necessary to take people to other parts of the world for 
refuge, but that, of course, remains to be seen. And that operation 
that we have, well-planned, is on hold at the moment.

  

  Ends
