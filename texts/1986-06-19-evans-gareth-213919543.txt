 Published by the Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra  for the Department of Foreign Affairs, May 1986. (RS85/20063) Cat. No. 85 6517 0. Printed by Watson Ferguson and Co., Brisbane.

 POSSESSION When travelling overseas there  OP are some hard facts you should 

 know. For a start, Australians  abroad are not protected by  Australian law. Visitors to a  foreign country are subject to  the laws of that country which  can be very different from our 

 own. All countries are deeply  concerned about drug abuse.  Foreign drug laws often make no  distinction between ‘hard’ and 

 ‘soft’ drugs. Sentences can be  extremely severe for carrying  even small quantities of these  types of drugs. 

 Some countries in Australia’s  immediate region have the  mandatory death penality for  drug offences.  The burden of proof in many  instances is on the accused to 

 prove their innocence. Pleading  ignorance of the law is no excuse.  Bail may well be refused, and it  can take a long time in difficult  prison conditions before a case  is finally brought before a court.

 DRUGS  CARRIES  HARSH  PENALTIES

 IF YOU ARE  ARRESTED  YOURCONSUL  CAN ONLY OFFER 

 LIMITED  ASSISTANCE.

 The Australian Consul can visit  you on your request after being  notified of your arrest. A list of  local lawyers can be provided, 

 (although no comment can be  offered on their competence).  Your family can be notified of  your arrest if you wish and  requests for financial assistance  can be relayed. The Consul can liaise with local 

 authorities to help ensure that  your rights under local law are  fully observed and to try and see  that you are treated according to  generally accepted international 

 standards. The Consul can also  make periodic visits to the prison.

 They cannot get youjrut cTJ -  prison. They cannot obtain  special treatment or represent  you at any legal proceedings  or give legal advice. Nor as a  general rule can the cost of  court or other interpreter 

 services be provided at  Australian Government  expense.

 At present there is a large  number of Australian serving  sentences or awaiting trial in  more than thirty countries 

 overseas. Many of these people  are held in Asian countries  which are not soft on drugs.  Drug possession or trafficking  can mean a long jail sentence,  far from family and friends,  in unfamiliar and unpleasant 

 surroundings.  It can also mean imprisonment  for a lengthy period until you’re  brought before a court. Then 

 you may be faced with a drawn  out trial conducted in a foreign  language which could bring a  severe penalty or even the death  penalty. Don’t risk your life. It’s just not  worth taking a trip with drugs.

 THINGS  YOUR  CONSUL  CANNOT 

 DO.
