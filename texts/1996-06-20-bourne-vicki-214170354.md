 NEWS RELEASE

 DEMOCRATS CONDEMN MIGRATION REGULATIONS BILL

 The Australian Democrats have expressed grave concerns about the human rights  implications of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2) 1996 which was  introduced into Federal Parliament last night. '

 Senator Vicki Bourne, Human Rights and Immigration Spokesperson for the  Democrats said ‘Î Î¯ passed, this Bill would significantly weaken laws protecting  human rights in Australia and would damage Australia’s reputation  internationally.

 “The main effect of this Bill is to deny people in immigration detention, especially  so-called boat people, access to legal representation.

 “Human rights laws in Australia must apply equally to every person in Australia.  Whether they be Australian-born, visitors, refugees, or anything else, there can be  no exceptions. *

 “While Australia’s human rights record is not perfect, in many ways wc have much  of which we can be proud. I urge all decent Australians, including  Parliamentarians, to oppose this Bill.”
