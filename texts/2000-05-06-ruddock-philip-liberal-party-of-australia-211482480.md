 East Hills Safe Haven to Close MPS 045/2000

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, has announced the formal closure of the East Hills safe haven, marking the end of the operation that brought about 6000 East Timorese and Kosovars to Australia for temporary protection.

 A total of 3965 Kosovars and 1932 East Timorese (including subsequent births) came to Australia during Operation Safe Haven in response to a call by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to help alleviate the humanitarian crises in Kosovo and East Timor.

 "It is exactly one year since the first Kosovars arrived at East Hills, so it is appropriate that we are today recognising the work that has been done at this facility to help the evacuees," Mr Ruddock said.

 "East Hills was the first centre to open, and is the last to close. All of the Kosovar evacuees were first brought to East Hills where they received health screening and orientation, whereas the East Timorese initially went to Darwin."

 Mr Ruddock said that, up until last week, 97 East Timorese remained at East Hills, mostly for health reasons. About half of this group returned on May 4, and the remaining 51 are being found accommodation in the community and will return home when they are fit to travel.

 "The Kosovars and the East Timorese suffered great trauma and dislocation. They had to flee the turmoil in their own countries and Australia was happy to accommodate them until such time as they were able to safely return home," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Operation Safe Haven allowed Australia to do its part in helping to alleviate the human

 suffering in these regions."

 The Kosovars began returning home in July last year and the East Timorese began returning in December when the UNHCR declared the respective regions to be safe.

 While in Australia, the evacuees had access to health care, food, education, professional trauma counselling and language services through havens in East Hills (New South Wales), Bandiana (Victoria), Singleton (New South Wales), Brighton (Tasmania), Puckapunyal (Victoria), Portsea (Victoria), Leeuwin (Western Australia) and Hampstead (South Australia).

 "The cost to Australia - about $120 million - was money well spent in a time of great need for these people," the Minister said.

 Mr Ruddock, his Parliamentary Secretary Kay Patterson, who played a pivotal role in Operation Safe Haven, along with the patrons of East Hills, Danna Vale MP and Senator Michael Forshaw, have formally thanked those who were involved.
