 Member for Adelaide Kate Ellis     

 EMPOWERING MULTICULTURAL COMMUNITIES IN ADELAIDE    

 Adelaide’s African community will use new computers to write resumes, apply for  driver’s licences and undertake citizenship training at the African Communities  Council of South Australia’s office, thanks to Federal Labor’s Building Multicultural  Communities Program.    

 Minister for Multicultural Affairs Kate Lundy, and the Member for Adelaide, Kate Ellis,  today announced the Council will receive $10,000 to replace their old computers,  and purchase new printers and software.      

 “This grant forms part of the Rudd Government’s $15 million Building Multicultural  Communities Programs which will strengthen social cohesion and promote inclusion  in diverse communities,” Minister Lundy said.    

 “Australia’s diversity is one of our greatest strengths and that is why the Rudd  Government is proud to support organisations that promote cohesion and  inclusiveness.”    

 Ms Ellis welcomed the funding saying the new computers will be valuable resource  that will help the Council’s community overcome barriers to social inclusion.    

 “Adelaide is a vibrant multicultural electorate and these new computers will be  valuable resources that will help new African migrants and refugees become active  members of the Adelaide community,” Ms Ellis said.    

 “Having access to a computer is vital for new migrants and refugees wanting to apply  for jobs, become independent, and get involved in their local community so these  new computers will be an important asset for the African Communities Council.”    

 The African Communities Council of South Australia will receive funding under  Stream 1 of the Building Multicultural Communities program which provides grants  between $1,000 and $10,000 to help organisations purchase a range of equipment,  such as computers, furniture and sporting goods.    

 Funding for this initiative has already been included in the budget.
