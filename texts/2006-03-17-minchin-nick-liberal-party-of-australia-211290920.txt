 AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT MONTHLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JANUARY 2006

 KEY POINTS

 â     The underlying cash balance for the 2005-06 year to 31 January 2006 was a surplus of 

 $2,800 million.

 â     The fiscal balance for the 2005-06 year to 31 January 2006 was a deficit of $38 million.

 â     The operating result for the 2005-06 year to 31 January 2006 was a surplus of $74 million.

 â     The difference between the fiscal and underlying cash balances is largely attributable to increases in education grants payable offset by increases in taxation and 

 other receivables.

 Care needs to be taken when comparing monthly or cumulative data across years and to full year estimates. Revenues and expenses do vary from month-to-month. Factors  such as The New Tax System, and the accrual framework including the timing of payments and policy decisions, can have a large impact on fiscal aggregates from one year  to the next and on year-to-date outcomes. Further, the January 2006 monthly financial statements were produced under the Australian Equivalents to International Financial  Reporting Standards (AEIFRS), with the exception that the Department of Defence is not yet reporting AEIFRS compliant data for monthly reporting purposes and the  Defence Materiel Organisation has partially adopted AEIFRS. The move to AEIFRS brings a number of changes including a new financial statement, the ‘Statement of  Changes in Equity’.

 FISCAL OUTCOMES

 Underlying Cash Balance

 The main components of the underlying cash balance are cash from operations and cash movements in the net investment in non-financial assets.

 The underlying cash balance for the year to 31 January 2006 was a surplus of $2,800 million. This underlying cash balance is $3,880 million lower than the January pro-rata  (a surplus of $6,680 million) of the 2005-06 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) estimate of $11,452 million, but is consistent with prior year January balances.  The difference reflects a number of individual variations including the following:

 Movements in underlying cash receipts:

 Lower receipts from: 

 â     Taxation in line with the usual monthly fluctuations in taxation receipts.

 Higher receipts from:

 â     Dividends due to the receipt of the RBA dividend in August each year.

 Movements in underlying cash payments:

 Lower payments for:

 â     Grants due to: 

 â     The AusLink and Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements programmes. Pro-rata comparisons are not necessarily a good indicator for these programmes as the 

 level of expenses does not occur equally each month but when the States and Local Governments make claims for payment;

 â     Underspends in a range of health related programmes; 

 â     The National Water Commission’s negotiations with funding recipients over the detailed provisions of the funding agreements have not yet been finalised, 

 although substantial progress has been made; and

 â     Lower demand than previously anticipated and milestone slippages for the following programmes: Textile, Clothing and Footwear Strategic Investment, 

 Commercial Ready, Assistance to Mitsubishi, Asia Pacific Space Centre, Hismelt, Ethanol Production and Biofuels;

 â     Personal Benefits due to: 

 â     lower than anticipated demand for Youth Allowance; and

 â     lower than expected numbers of people receiving Parenting Payment Single and Disability Support Pension.

 â     Suppliers, as Defence traditionally spends a higher proportion of its suppliers in the second six months of the financial year, reflecting lead times to implement 

 processes, and administrative lead times associated with procurement. Some of the variance is due to slippages in contracting activity, invoicing and payment  processing, and some savings generated from the favourable currency exchange rate difference, which will be returned to the government at the end of the year.

 â     Foreign aid, specifically, AusAID’s three country and regional programmes (PNG & Pacific; East Asia; and South Asia, Africa and Other) as well as the Emergency, 

 Humanitarian and Refugee Aid and NGO, Volunteer and Community programmes. These payments are not incurred on a pro rata basis, due to the timing of activities,  requirements of partner Governments and organisations, and the unpredictable nature of expenditure on emergencies.

 â     Employees, due to lower Army numbers, an under spend in Reserve salaries and lower than predicted allowance payments. Ongoing recruitment problems in a tighter 

 employment market also contribute to the variance.

 Higher payments for:

 â     Grants, due to a number of education grants being expensed once a year around January being only partially offset by an increase in grants payable.

 â     Personal Benefits as personal benefits claimed through the tax system are typically higher in the first half of the year as tax returns are lodged.

 Fiscal Balance

 The fiscal balance for the year to 31 January 2006 was a deficit of $38 million. The main components of the fiscal balance are the GFS net operating balance, which was a  surplus of $257 million, and a net capital investment of $295 million for the year to 31 January 2006 (refer to the Reconciliation of the Operating Result to Fiscal Balance on  page 10 for further detail).

 FINANCIAL OUTCOMES

 Actual expenses are $3,669 million higher when compared with a pro-rata of the MYEFO estimate. The main reasons for the lower result, provided by function, are due to:

 â     Education Function - higher grant expenses as education grants are expensed once a year in January.

 â     Social Security and Welfare Function - higher personal benefits expenses which are typically higher in the first half of the financial year as tax returns are lodged.

 Partially offset by:

 â     Transport Function - lower expenses mainly attributable to AusLink and other transport programmes as the level of these expenses does not occur equally each 

 month but when State and/or Local Governments make claims for payment.

 â     Defence Function - lower supplier expenses as traditionally a higher proportion of the suppliers budget is used in the second six months of the financial year, reflecting 

 lead times associated with procurement.

 â     Health Function - lower grant expenses due to underspends in range of health programmes.

 Assets and Liabilities

 The net asset balance within the General Government sector is a negative net asset position of  $39,097 million at 31 January 2006.

 NOTES:

 The accounting policies in this part are generally consistent with the requirements of AEIFRS. While the scope for financial reporting recommended by AEIFRS and AAS 31  is the whole of government (that is, the Australian Government public sector), the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 requires monthly financial statements  to be consistent with the budget estimates. Accordingly and pursuant to the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998, this presentation covers the general government sector  only. This publication does not include full note disclosures.

 With the introduction of Business Activity Statements and Instalment Activity Statements in 2000-2001, taxpayers provide information on payments associated with several  types of tax when lodging the statement and paying the aggregate net tax amount. Thus, while total tax collections are known with certainty at the end of each month, the  distribution across the relevant heads of revenue cannot be finalised until all statements are received and processed. The outcomes for some revenue items provided in this  statement are thus estimates, in accordance with the best judgement of the Taxation Commissioner, and subject to revision. The taxation revenue items not affected are:  Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, Excise duty, Customs duty, Other Taxes and Individuals Refunds.

 The sum of the revenue accrued in the month and the revisions to prior periods equals the revenue reported in the Statement of Revenue and Expenses.

 All taxation items in these notes are reported on an AEIFRS basis, unless otherwise indicated.

 NOTE 1: INCOME TAX

 NOTE 2: INDIRECT TAX

 NOTE 3: GOODS AND SERVICES TAX

 In regard to GST revenue, AAS would suggest the gross amount of GST be included in the Australian Government’s Financial Statements. However, the clear policy intent of  the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Australian Government-State Financial Relations is that the GST is a State tax collected by the Australian Government in  an agency capacity. Therefore, accrued GST revenues and associated payments to the States and Territories are not recognised in these statements.

 NOTE 4: ADJUSTMENT FOR EDUCATION GRANT EXPENDITURE

 In regard to education grant expenditure, adherence to AAS results in fewer education expenses being reported until the signing of the Ministerial determination, which  normally occurs between December and February each year. This produces a bunching of expenses such that the full year's expense is recognised at that time and remains  relatively constant until June. The table below provides details of the cash paid by DEST and attributable to the Education function for the year to date.
