 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS 

 

 I  am  delighted  to  be  here  this  morning  to  give  the  opening  address  at  this  very  

 significant  conference.   I  congratulate  the  Multicultural  Research  Centre  of  the  

 University  of  Sydney  and  the  National  Europe  Centre  and  Centre  for  Population  

 Research  of  the  Australian  National  University  for  organising  such  an  important  

 conference and inviting so many eminent speakers to give presentations on a wide 

 range of vital issues.   

 

 The  Council  for  Multicultural  Australia  has  a  direct  interest  in  a  number  of  these  

 issues and while others do not form its core business, the Council is, nevertheless, 

 aware of their importance to a multicultural Australia. 

 

 I look forward to this morning’s sessions and regret that I am unable to attend the 

 entire  conference.   I  look  forward,  however,  to  reading  the  papers  covering  the  

 remainder of the conference. 

 

 Today I will speak briefly about: 

 

 - Migration and its benefits 

 - Australian multiculturalism, 

 - the work of the Council for Multicultural Australia,  

 - Community Harmony, and 

 - Citizenship. 

 

 MIGRATION TO AUSTRALIA 

 

 Australia has a long tradition of immigration.  Indeed, Australia has been built on 

 settlement from other countries.  In many ways this has determined the very nature 

 of  contemporary Australian  society,  with  the  six  million  migrants  who  have  come  

 

  3

 to  Australia  since  World  War  II  representing  150  different  nationalities,  200  

 different languages and more than 70 religions.    

 

 I  am  advised  that  Australia’s  migration  program  this  financial  year  will  be  the  

 largest  in  over  a  decade  with  100,000  to  110,000  places,  58%  of  these  for  skilled  

 migrants.   

 

 Australia also takes significant numbers of refugee and humanitarian entrants each 

 year.  Under its offshore humanitarian program, Australia expects to resettle more 

 than 12,000 people from many parts of the world this financial year.  This year the 

 focus  is  on  Africa,  the  Middle  East  and  South-West  Asia  although,  of  course,  we  

 also resettle significant numbers of people from Europe and elsewhere.  

 

 Settlement Programs 

 

 The process of immigration doesn't end once a new arrival sets foot on our shores.  

 Settlement  programs,  managed  by  the  Department  of  Immigration  and  

 Multicultural  and  Indigenous  Affairs  (DIMIA),  contribute  enormously  to  the  

 successful adjustment of migrants to Australia by assisting them to become full and 

 active participants in Australia's democratic society.   

 

 I am aware that these services include: English language training through the Adult 

 Migrant English Program, translating and interpreting through the Translating and 

 Interpreting  Service,  and  settlement  support,  information,  referral  and  outreach  

 services  through  DIMIA's  Community  Settlement  Services  Scheme,  and  the  

 national network of 34 Migrant Resource Centres and Agencies.  A senior DIMIA 

 officer will discuss these services in detail later in the Conference.

 THE BENEFITS OF MIGRATION TO AUSTRALIA 

 

 It  is  widely  recognised  that  migrants  have  made,  and  are  still  making,  a  vast  

 contribution  to  Australian  society.   This  contribution  is  manyfold,  but  for  the  

 purposes of today’s discussion I will divide that contribution into two categories - 

 economic and social benefits. 

 

 ECONOMIC BENEFITS 

 

 Research  strongly  supports  that  when  a  migration  program  has  the  right  balance  

 between  skilled,  family and  humanitarian  migrants  and  between  age  groups,  there  

 is significant economic reward to the community in demand for goods and services, 

 increased jobs and so on. 

 

 Cultural diversity is an economic force to be reckoned with - it’s good for business, 

 and for the community. This has given rise to the term “productive diversity”.   

 

 Productive diversity recognises the economic value of Australia’s culturally diverse 

 society.  

 

 The  CMA  has  played  an  active  role,  along  with  DIMIA,  in  promoting  productive  

 diversity to the Australian business community.   

 

 Some of Australia’s leading companies, such as: 

 â¢ AMP, 

 â¢ Ford, 

 â¢ Bristol-Myers, and 

 â¢ Alcoa,  

 

 

  5

 have begun to identify new and innovative ways of drawing on the diversity of the 

 Australian  people  to  ensure  Australia’s  competitiveness  in  a  progressively  more  

 aggressive domestic and global marketplace. 

 

 The  CMA  has  supported  the  development  of  a  diversity and  sustainability project  

 involving these four companies. 

 

 Productive  diversity  means  that  companies  can  draw  on  their  employees’  

 knowledge of overseas business networks and practices, their linguistic and cultural 

 skills, and their understanding of the particular needs and consumer preferences of 

 groups  within  the  domestic  market,  to  gain  a  competitive  edge.  

 

 SOCIAL BENEFITS 

 

 Cultural diversity is one of the greatest benefits of immigration to Australia.   

 As  a  result  of  the  many  experiences  that  its  people  have  brought  to  this  country,  

 Australia has become an extraordinarily cosmopolitan society.   

 

 Should one examine the curricula of any of our schools, universities or colleges of 

 adult education, there is to be seen the rich bounty of our diversity reflected in the 

 languages, customs and histories that are available for study.  

 

 One  merely  has  to  walk  through  the  dining  precinct  in  any  Australian  city  to  

 appreciate how so many cuisines from so many places are now considered part of  

 the nation’s diet.  

 

 Today's skilled migrants are younger than those of  earlier generations, have better 

 English language skills and hold qualifications that are in national shortage.   

 

 They  bring  new  ideas,  skills,  technology,  understanding  and  contacts.   They  are  

 reducing  skill  shortages,  helping  develop  new  businesses,  contributing  to  

 

  6

 technological development and enhancing our knowledge of international business 

 markets.  

 

 AUSTRALIAN MULTICULTURALISM 

 

 Australia is a multicultural country and is one of the world’s most culturally diverse 

 countries.  Between  us  we  speak  over  200  languages  -  including  45  Indigenous  

 languages.  

 

 Migration over the last 200 years has built on the diversity that already existed in 

 this  country’s  Indigenous  population  to  deliver  the  reality  of  our  modern,  

 multicultural community.  Over that period of time, the way we view migrants has 

 changed.  

 

 Where  30  years  ago  we  sought  simply  to  acknowledge  and  accommodate  recent  

 migrants, we now, rightly, emphasise the benefits that we can derive from the full 

 spectrum of our diverse people. 

 

 But  Australian  multiculturalism  is  more  than  simply  an  acknowledgment  that  

 Australians come from a wide variety of cultural backgrounds: 

 - it recognises, celebrates and values Australia’s cultural diversity which has 

 helped shape and enrich Australian culture and social institutions; 

 - it promotes social cohesion because it accepts and respects the rights of all 

 Australians to express and share their individual cultural heritage within an 

 overriding commitment  to Australia and the basic structures and values of  

 Australian democracy; and 

 - it  envisages  that  individuals  and  groups  can  participate  fully  in  the  

 economic, social and political life of Australian society without losing their 

 distinctiveness. 

 

 

  7

 It must be said, therefore, that we have embraced multiculturalism and, as a result, 

 the  diversity  of  our  population  has  delivered  us  benefits  in  creating  a  vital  and  

 thriving community and economy.   

 

 In  Australia,  multiculturalism  has  evolved  into  a  process  of  respect  for  the  

 contribution each person brings to Australia whatever their cultural background.   

 

 The key to Australian multiculturalism is the aim of ensuring that Australians of all 

 backgrounds have an overriding commitment to Australia's democratic foundations 

 and  legal  structures.   This  means  our  society  maintains  a  balance  of  rights,  

 privileges and responsibilities, which is emphasised by Australian citizenship.  

 

 Allow  me,  at  this  point  to  explain  the  advent  and  purpose  of  the  Council  for  

 Multicultural Australia (CMA). 

 

 THE COUNCIL FOR MULTICULTURAL AUSTRALIA 

 

 The CMA was established in July 2000.  I am the Chairman of the Council which 

 comprises  17  prominent  members,  from  all  States  and  Territories,  and  from  a  

 variety of backgrounds. 

 

 The  primary  role  of  the  CMA  is  to  assist  the  Commonwealth  Government  in  

 implementing  its  multicultural  policy,  a  New  Agenda  for  Multicultural  Australia, 

 with a focus on raising awareness and understanding of multiculturalism. 

 

 Our three key objectives are: 

 â¦ to  promote  inclusiveness  -  ensuring that  Australians  understand  that  

 multiculturalism is relevant to, and inclusive of, all Australians, 

 â¦ to promote the benefits of productive diversity - ensuring that we all act to 

 maximise the social and economic dividends of our diversity and to promote 

 its benefits, and 

 

  8

 â¦ to  promote  community  harmony  -  ensuring  that  Australians  acknowledge  

 Australia’s success as a harmonious and culturally diverse nation and work 

 to bolster community harmony. 

 

 Our vision is of:  

 “a  united  and  harmonious  Australia,  built  on  the  foundations  of  

 Australian  democracy,  and  developing  our  continually  evolving  

 nationhood  by  recognising,  embracing,  valuing  and  investing  in  our  

 heritage and cultural diversity”. 

 

 CMA ACTIVITIES 

 

 Council  members  and  the  CMA  as  a  whole  have  been  actively  engaged  in  

 promoting multiculturalism throughout the country: 

 â¢ The CMA as a whole has met on 10 occasions during which we have had 

 some very frank, lively and constructive discussion.  

 â¢ We’ve met with the Prime Minister, Premiers and Ministers to promote the 

 Council and Australian multiculturalism. 

 â¢ We’ve  consulted  and  met  with  over  200  key individuals,  committees,  and  

 private and public organisations. 

 â¢ Our  public  information  strategy  involves  media  releases,  a  national  

 newsletter and meeting with strategic community and professional groups. 

 â¢ Council  members  also  meet  regularly  with  community  organisations  

 throughout the country. 

 

 The CMA has established partnerships and collaborations with groups like: 

 â¦ Surf Life Saving Australia; 

 â¦ NSW Guides; 

 â¦ the National Police Ethnic Advisory Bureau; 

 â¦ the Australian Human Resources Institute; 

 

  9

 â¦ Reconciliation Australia; 

 â¦ Rotary; and 

 â¦ the RSL.  

 

 CMA  members  actively  engage  with  communities  across  Australia.    We  work  

 closely  with  the  Government  listening  to  communities  and  encouraging  programs  

 which foster and develop inclusiveness and community harmony. 

 

 COMMUNITY HARMONY 

 

 After  the  terrorist  attacks  in  Bali  on  12  October  last  year,  Australians  faced  the  

 challenge of maintaining community harmony.  

 

 Significant  negative  reactions  to  the  terrorist  bombings  in  Bali  included  increased  

 concern  among  Muslim  communities,  as  well  as  anti-Muslim  sentiment  and  

 actions.   The  current  situation  in  the  Middle  East,  in  particular  in  Iraq,  has  also  

 caused a great deal of distress for Middle Eastern and Muslim Australians. 

 

 Australian  political  leaders  condemned  the  attacks  in  Bali  and  have  commented  

 extensively on the situation in Iraq.  In doing so, they also expressed their support 

 for  Muslims  and  Iraqis  living  in  Australia.   I  offer  the  following  examples  from  

 speeches and Press Releases by the Prime Minister, the Hon John Howard, and the 

 Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Gary Hardgrave: 

 

 “I implore all members of  this House to get on with the important business of  

 offering  a  sense  of  outreach  and  support  to,  in  particular,  those  people  from  

 Iraq,  but  also  to  those  from  the  Arab-speaking  communities  and,  indeed,  the  

 Muslim communities in this country.  It is critical that we offer them a sense of 

 support and welcome, and all Australians have a role to play in this regard”. 

 -  11  February  2003,  Gary  Hardgrave  to  the  House  of  Representatives  Main  

 Committee, Ministerial Statements on Iraq. 

 

  10 

 

 “Muslims  in  Australia  have  played  an  important  part  in  ensuring  Australia  is  

 regarded as one of the world's most cohesive and harmonious nations. 

 “This  has  been  a  difficult  year  for  many Australians  of  different  backgrounds.   

 However,  people  have  worked  together…to  seek  to  maintain  community  

 harmony in Australia.  I thank the leadership of the Muslim community for the 

 genuine part played in ensuring ongoing community harmony despite the efforts 

 of a few who have attempted to spread division”. 

 -  6  December  2002,  Gary Hardgrave  in  a  Press  Release  marking Eid  -  Ul-Fitr  

 (the End Of Ramadan). 

 

 and: 

 

 “Australia  is  home  to  several  hundred  thousand  people  of  Middle  Eastern  

 background.  We welcomed them…, and we appreciate their contribution to our 

 nation.  Many of them could be torn between seeing Saddam [Hussein] brought 

 to account and the possible dangers facing their families back in Iraq.  During 

 this  time,  they  will  need  our  compassion  and  our  support.   All  Australians  

 should ensure that this is offered”. 

 - 4 February 2003, Prime Minister, Statement to Parliament on Iraq. 

 

 LIVING IN HARMONY 

 

 The  social  benefits  of  multiculturalism  come  from  having  a  harmonious  

 community, without the debilitating effects of discrimination and civil strife.   

 

 To this end, the CMA also advises on the Commonwealth Government’s Living in 

 Harmony program.  

 

 

  11 

 Rather  than  impose  solutions,  the  Living  in  Harmony  program  challenges  

 Australians to lead by example by recognising that communities are best placed to 

 identify local problems and to know how to address them.  

 

 Community  grants  are  the  centrepiece  of  this  program.   They  provide  funds  for  

 projects to solve local problems where they occur, and combat racism at the grass 

 roots. 

 

 The  Council  plays  an  important  role  in  the  Living  in  Harmony  initiative  by  

 promoting  the  grants  program  to  community  organisations  and  assisting  in  the  

 assessment of applications for these grants. 

 

 Living  in  Harmony  projects  bring  people  together  to  share  information  about  

 themselves, their cultures and foster mutual understanding.   

 Through the program, people who may not have had anything to do with each other 

 previously  are  finding  that  not  only  do  they  share  a  common  humanity,  but  

 common values and a common commitment to Australia’s growth and development 

 as a harmonious nation.  

 

 HARMONY DAY 

 

 Harmony Day is a key part of the Living in Harmony program and is celebrated on 

 21  March.   It  will  highlight  the  way  Australia  has  embraced  its  diverse  cultural  

 make-up to produce a productive, progressive and harmonious community. 

 

 Harmony  Day  coincides  with  the  United  Nations  International  Day  for  the  

 Elimination  of  Racial  Discrimination.   Harmony  Day  celebrations  have  grown  in  

 size and national significance since it started in 1999.   

 

 Each year Harmony Day provides Australians with an opportunity to: 

 

 

  12 

 â¢ think about our community’s success as a multicultural society; 

 â¢ recommit  to  continuing  respect,  good  will  and  understanding  between  all  

 Australians of all backgrounds; and 

 â¢ say no to racism. 

 

 The key theme for Harmony Day 2003 is You + Me = Us. 

 

 Harmony Day is more than just one day.  It is a series of community-based events 

 occurring throughout February and March. 

 

 Harmony  Day  is  a  community  event  where  all  Australians  and  communities  can  

 show their support for the traditional Australian values of justice, equality, fairness, 

 friendship and living in harmony. 

 

 The Council works very closely with DIMIA’s Multicultural Affairs Branch, along 

 with  groups  and  individuals  throughout  Australia,  to  promote  Harmony  Day  and  

 develop ideas for activities. 

 

 The  success  of  Harmony  Day  is  due  to  enormous  community  support  and  it  is  

 growing each year, with 2003 expected to be the biggest yet. 

 

 CITIZENSHIP 

 

 This year, along with many of  my colleagues on the Council, I had the honour of  

 being made a Citizenship Ambassador.  In this role we represented the Minister for 

 Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Gary Hardgrave MP, at citizenship 

 ceremonies in most states and territories on Australia Day. 

 On Australia Day this year, nearly 8,400 people took out Australian citizenship in 

 236  ceremonies  throughout  Australia.   The  candidates  came  from  more  than  140  

 countries  and  the  citizenship  ceremonies  ranged  from  large  ceremonies  in  capital  

 cities to smaller ceremonies in parks and on beaches throughout Australia. 

 

  13 

 

 The  taking  out  of  Australian  citizenship  is  perhaps  the  ‘ultimate’  step  for  new  

 arrivals.  It marks the conclusion of the immigration journey and the beginning of 

 life  as  a  new  member  of  the  Australian  family,  with  all  the  responsibilities  and  

 privileges  that  this  entails.  This  can  only  enhance  their  sense  of  belonging;  and  

 more  broadly,  it  can  only  enhance  the  cohesion  and  harmony  of  the  society  in  

 which we live.  

 

 CONCLUDING REMARKS 

 

 Australian  society  has  been  built  on  the  fundamental  principles  of  fairness  and  

 decency  and  the  premise  that  opportunity  should  be  equally  available  to  all,  

 regardless of background, gender, race or religion. 

 

 These values have formed an essential foundation on which Australia has been able 

 to  be  transformed  into  one  of  the  world's  most  successful,  culturally-diverse,  

 democratic, national communities. 

 

 Australians  have  every  reason  to  be  proud  of  our  accomplishments  as  a  

 multicultural  nation.   Australian  multiculturalism  will  continue  to  contribute  

 towards Australian development, based firmly on the foundation of our democratic 

 system and respect for Australia law.  

 

 Australia has reaped rich rewards from migration throughout its history.  Migration 

 will continue to play an important role in our future.  

 

 I wish you all the best for a successful conference.   

 

 Thank you again for this opportunity to speak with you today.
