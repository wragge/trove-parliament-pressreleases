 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  Senator the Hon. Bob Carr  September 27, 2012  PROTECTING HOSPITALS AND HEALTH WORKERS IN SYRIA    

 This week I’ve been meeting with Foreign Ministers from the European Union and  the Middle East on the issue of Syria.    

 Based on these discussions, Australia will now bring forward a plan to protect and  respect access to hospitals and medical care in Syria, which has been severely  interrupted by the ongoing conflict.     

 The plan would involve securing a commitment from all sides: 

 ï· Not to target medical personnel  ï· Not to block access to doctors, hospitals or emergency care; and  ï· Not to attack medical facilities 

 

 This would not be a military or political intervention in Syrian affairs.    

 It would be simply designed to protect the lives of ordinary Syrians caught in conflict  zones.    

 I’ll be seeking broad international support for this humanitarian goal - to reduce the  toll of dead and wounded in Syria by respecting access to medical care.    

 Support would be required from Middle Eastern and European states, and from  Russia.    

 Implementation could be monitored by a neutral third party, such as a non-government organisation.    

 More than 30,000 Syrians have died in this conflict.    

 The United Nations has estimated more than 2 ½ million Syrians are in need of  humanitarian care and up to 500,000 are homeless.    

 We remain committed to any action that would bring this conflict to an end    

 But we need also to care for those caught in the fighting right now.    

 This proposal could assist tens of thousands of Syrians in need of medical aid and  unable to reach it as fighting continues in their cities or towns.    

 In addition to this plan, Australia will also provide another $4 million for the delivery  of medical aid to Syrians. 

 ï· $2 million for medical supplies and emergency food aid in Syria; and  ï· $2 million for food, shelter and health care in Syrian refugee camps in Jordan and  elsewhere. 

 

 This is what Australians do - helping those in need in global conflicts, with  humanitarian aid and basic food and medical support.    

 This $4 million additional contribution lifts our total commitment to the Syrian  humanitarian crisis to $24.5 million.    

 Australia is now the third largest national contributor to humanitarian aid for Syria,  behind the United States and the United Kingdom.
