 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 05/007 WEDNESDAY 12 JANUARY 2005   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS SPOKESPERSON ON IMMIGRATION  $336M DETENTION CENTRE AN OBSCENE WASTE OF MONEY The Government has picked one of the most expensive parts of Australia to build a $336 million detention centre that there is absolutely no need for, the Australian Democrats said today. Queensland Senator, Andrew Bartlett, has called on the Government to scrap the planned detention centre to be built on Christmas Island, labelling it an obscene waste of money. "Regardless of whether or not you support the Government's policy of mandatory detention, it is disgraceful to waste over $330 million on a centre there is not the slightest need for," said Senator Bartlett, the Democrats’ immigration spokesperson. "We have an empty detention centre at Woomera, another at Darwin that has never been used, and another still planned to be built in Brisbane.   “The Government recently admitted the cost of the detention centre had blown out from $220 million to $336 million.  Senator Bartlett visited Christmas Island last November, including the proposed site of the new centre and the existing detention centre where 43 Vietnamese asylum seekers have been imprisoned for more than 18 months. “The Christmas Island site has been cleared over 18 months ago, with nothing built. All that has been achieved is the damage to more habitat of the endangered booby bird that is unique to the Island and the risk of more soil runoff into the surrounding National Park. "The only opportunity for Christmas Island's economic survival is its amazing and unique environment yet there is a lack of financial support to protect the native wildlife from weeds and invasive species such as the crazy ant. Meanwhile hundreds of millions of dollars are being thrown away on a building nobody wants or needs." "The permanent population of Christmas Island is between 1200 and 1500 people. To build a detention facility that can hold 800 people is ridiculously inappropriate for a community of that size." "There are a hundred better ways that sort of money could be used for the Christmas Island community, or for the rest of Australia, or indeed for those in immediate need in our wider region."  "Schools, hospitals and the homeless could be helped with that $336 million.” Media contact - Daele Healy - 0419 867 649
