  ADDRESS TO THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB

  

  Senator Bob Brown

  

  28 September 1998

  

  In Sydney two weeks ago, a young man asked me simply “Is there any 
hope?” That question sears the fabric of young Australia. We Greens 
are defiant of those who use office to divide society and wreck the 
environment. We take up the challenge to put optimism back on young 
Australia’s agenda. We are a party of action and through our action 
we offer hope.

  

  Ladies and Gentlemen, in an election marked by no higher vision for 
Australia than how it is to be taxed, the Greens offer you an Australia 
with the world’s best environment and lifestyle standards.

  

  We will write the nation’s duty as custodian of the environment, 
into the constitution. Unlike Labor, we will rescind Mr Howard’s Native 
Title Act and re-empower the Indigenous people’s culture of care for 
the land. We will embed a credo of intergenerational equity into national 
politics. We will inscribe over every entrance to parliament this question 
- “Will people, 100 years from now, thank us for what we do today?” 
It is a question which should predicate every political debate. Through 
this homage to all future generations of Australians, we insist on their 
right to inherit a continent at least as beautiful, as clean, as livable 
and as full of potential as the Australia of today.

  

  And as full of potential as the 125 women and men who are standing 
for election as Greens around the continent.

  

  [INTRODUCE CANDIDATES-

  

  Louise Crossley. Tasmanian Senate candidate

  Charmaine Clark. Victorian Senate candidate

  Deb Foskey. ACT Senate candidate

  John Sutton. NSW Senate candidate

  

  Also in attendance - Ian Cohen - Upper House MP from NSW]

  

  And a special word for my fellow Green Senator in Western Australia, 
Dee Margetts. Senator Margetts, as almost a lone voice then, led the 
fight in Canberra against GATT legislation at the height of the economic 
rationalist mania four years ago. She has repeatedly warned of the ravages 
of unfettered competition policy on Australia’s businesses and jobs. 
She leads the Senate defence of Indigenous rights when eroded by legislation 
like Wik and, of course, she is an ardent defender of WA’s environment 
and wild forests.

  

  She is standing for reelection in WA.

  

  [Other candidates not in attendance —Drew Hutton (QLD), Craig Wilkins 
(SA), Ilana Eldridge (NT Reps)]

  

  Any one of these outstanding Greens candidates, elected to parliament, 
will liven up that fusty institution.

  

  Under John Howard the parliament has become reactionary. It is as 
exciting as watching paint dry. Instead of leading this great nation 
to the forefront of human endeavour, his government is transferring 
power and decision-making to the faceless multi-nationals of the stock-exchange. 
Mr Howard’s economic rationalism, empowers the corporate millionaires 
in the absurd hope that the trickle down effect will see Australia’s 
poor get enough to survive on. This is the theory, as JK Galbraith put 
it, that if you feed more wheat to the horses enough will go through 
and fall on the pavement to feed the sparrows.

  

  Half the multinational corporations pay no tax at all. And Mr Howard’s 
GST would. widen the gap between rich and poor even further.

  

  Controls on the export of Australia’s minerals have been lifted. 
The need for multinational logging companies to get a licence for the 
export of shattered forests as woodchips has been scrapped. Australia’s 
time-honoured industrial relations system has been gutted by the Coalition 
and the Democrats. Labor’s $2.7 million dollars for street kids to 
buy books, rulers and other basic equipment as an encouragement to get 
them back to school has been abolished. So has the dental scheme for 
older Australians. With the support of the Democrats again, Mr Howard 
introduced that infamous $26,000 levy on old folk entering nursing homes.

  

  Given a second term, Mr Howard will privatise the rest of Telstra. 
The Greens will keep Telstra in public hands. The Greens will protect 
Australian Post from privitisation.

  

  He will allow the big four banks to amalgamate into two, with a massive 
loss of competition and services for ordinary Australians, specially 
in the bush, The Greens will tackle him against further deregulation 
of the banks.

  

  He will further lift controls on media ownership. 
We will not.

  

  He will make another ambush on the ABC. Instead 
of grizzling about bias - if only the Greens got a fraction of Mr Howard’s 
ABC coverage — we are staunch defenders of the ABC.

  

  These are just   some of the reasons why some extra strength opposition, the Greens, 
is essential in the Senate.

  

  We won’t have a bar of Mr Howard’s GST. A year ago, we set out 
to find if a green GST — that is, a socially just, and environmentally 
sound, GST - is possible. But, no matter how economists readjust the 
knobs, an equitable and ecological GST does not exist. It is not possible.

  

  The Democrats want a foodless GST, but it will not be a toothless 
GST -- it will still bite poor and low-paid Australians, and, as I will 
explain, the Howard package is manifestly bad for the environment. We 
reject that package.

  

  Rather than try to make a silk purse out of Mr Howard’s sow's ear, 
the Greens have a tax package much better attuned to the Australian 
concept of a fair go.

  

  We advocate European—style ecotaxes. These are based on the principle 
of making polluters pay and giving incentives to those who use clean 
green technology.

  

  Our modest carbon tax of $25 per tonne of C02, for example, would 
raise $6 billion - enough to abolish payroll tax and to fire Australia 
into world leadership in clean green technologies.

  

  Compare that with the myopic Howard GST package which donates $5 billion 
in reduced diesel and petrol costs to the big mining, transport and 
logging companies as an incentive to bum fossil fuels, produce greenhouse 
gases and pollute the air with potent cancer-causing chemicals. Where 
his $5 billion promotes pollution, our $6 billion would reduce it dramatically. 
And reduced it must be!

  

  Each of the last 15 months was the hottest in the history of weather 
records around the world. Global warming from greenhouse gases threatens 
the next generation of Australians with huge economic and social dislocation 
as well as environmental damage. A number of our neighbouring Pacific 
and Indian Ocean island nations face extinction. Tens of millions of 
our Asian and Pacific Rim neighbours may be forced to migrate as environmental 
refugees. Storm damage in Australia is predicted to escalate.

  

  In these circumstances, well-known to every school child in the nation, 
the Prime Minister comes up with a tax package which actually stimulates 
global warming! Even last year’s warning by more than 1000 leading 
economists from around the world that global warming seriously threatens 
our way of life and economy has fallen on deaf ears in his oval office. 
Last year, he cut all funding for solar power R&D and put $111 million 
instead into funding R&D into dirty fuel - coal and gas! We would 
reverse this studied and applied ignorance by Mr Howard.

  

  So, instead of rewarding greenhouse gas production, we would use $2 
billion of the government’s $5 billion gift to the polluting industries 
to make Australia the sun-power nation of the next century. Australia 
already has the world’s best solar technology. We would integrate 
a national solar, wind, public transport and energy efficiency program. 
It would afford interest—free loans for every household and business 
to install solar hot water, insulation and energy-efficient equipment. 
It would save all Australians money. For example, switching to the world’s 
most energy—efficient refridgerators would save an average household 
$1000 in power bills over 15 years.

  

  Under our plan, the spin off from thousands of small businesses would 
be 53 000 new jobs in the towns and cities of Australia. As well, our 
plan would stimulate a multi-billion dollar export industry with Australia, 
the ‘sun-power nation’, exporting solar power options to the world.

  

  This is no pipedream. There is a clear precedent. In 1983 when 27 
Greens were first elected to the German parliament, the Bundestag, Chancellor 
Kohl reacted by bringing in the world’s most advanced pollution control 
and recycling laws. Business went ape. ‘How can we compete with the 
rest of the world with such a green handicap?’ they shouted. But now, 
fifteen years later, German environmental technology leads the world. 
It is a multi—billion dollar export industry and has created half 
a million jobs.

  

  In an election where health has been put in 
the back seat, the Greens’ environment policies promote a healthy 
Australia as well. They echo the call of the Australian Public Health 
Association just two weeks ago. It warned that

  

  ·   Environmental degradation, the global warming that has already occurred, 
and greenhouse gas emissions are now impacting adversely on the health 
of human populations.

  

  ·   Both 
of Australia's major parties are ignoring a most serious health issue 
and have failed to include consideration of it in their tax packages.

  

  ·   The 
Australian electorate deserves tax reform that will contribute to a 
sustainable future.

  

  They went on to call for

  

  “each of the political parties to include 
in their tax plans a system of eco-taxes (eg carbon tax) of   the kind that have 
been advocated by US Vice President Al Gore, and implemented with effect 
in a growing number of European countries.

  

  The health professionals added

  

  We believe that eco-taxes will benefit both 
the short and long term health of Australia  ns and that such taxes will be both understood and supported by the 
Australian electorate. We believe that most Australians are concerned 
at the need to constrain greenhouse emissions, which, if they continue 
at their current rate, will result in ecological changes profoundly 
damaging to human health.”

  

  The Greens alone have answered this call from 
Australia’s public health professionals by making eco taxes a core 
election policy.

  

  A sun-power Australia, powering into the next 
century, is a cornerstone of o  ur platform.

  

  Let me list some other points of the strongest 
environment policies any party will offer Australia’s voters -

  

  ·   Instead of Mr Howard’s 8%   increase  in greenhouse gas emissions 
over 1990 levels by the 2010 we would   decrease  emissions by 50%

  

  ·   We would 
fund local government to stop all sewage entering Australia's rivers 
and seas by 2010. This would include reprocessing solid waste to make 
nearly 1 billion tonnes of fertiliser per annum. It would also make 
enough fuel to add 8 percent to the national power grid. Your loss, 
Australia’s gain!

  

  We would -

  ·   Put $1 billion annually into a national park and biodiversity program 
to protect the continent's wildlife, natural ecosystems and World Heritage 
areas

  

  ·   In consultation 
with the Traditional Owners, promote World Heritage listing and protection 
for Cape York, the Kimberley and Tasmania's unprotected forests. including 
the Tarkine, Great Western Tiers and Southern Forests

  

  ·   Sideline 
Robert Hill and John Anderson and appoint an independent board of nine 
ecological experts to’ disburse the $1.25 billion Natural Heritage 
Trust.

  

  ·   Block 
Mr Howard’s outrageous move to lever the Traditional Owners out of 
control of Uluru and Kakadu

  

  ·   Ask 
Australians at a referendum to give the Commonwealth responsibility, 
in the Constitution, for the nation’s environment

  

  ·   Institute 
a nation—wide recycling scheme, ensuring hundreds of thousands of 
jobs, including a beverage deposit scheme which of itself would create 
10 000 jobs.

  

  ·   Promote 
Australia as the unpolluted garden for world food, including. Uniform 
national labelling laws for organic produce.

  

  Now to this election’s litmus issue: Jabiluka.

  

  Before the last election, John Howard told 
an anxious nation, including the Mirrar people, the traditional owners 
of the   beautiful 
Jabiluka Valley in Kakadu, that he didn't see how mining at Kakadu could 
happen “because of environmental considerations.” After winning 
the election, his minister against the environment, Robert Hill, told 
the Senate in relation to the world’s second biggest uranium mine 
proposed for Jabiluka that “the rights of the traditional owners clearly 
should be respected”. Robert Hill has disgraced that sentiment.

  

  As we sit here today, the bulldozers are ripping up the Mirrar people’s 
valley. Mirrar leader, Yvonne Margarula, and Jacqui Katona, have actually 
been charged and convicted in the Northern Territory courts with trespass 
on their own lands. The uranium miner, ERA, a subsidiary of the multinational 
mining and logging corporation, North, has effectively been given the 
landrights to the Mirrar heartland by the deceitful Howard-Hill duo. 
Though polls show 70 or 80% of Australians oppose the mine Mr Howard 
has given it the go-ahead. This is the leader who talks, on other issues, 
of the concept of mandate!

  

  In politics there is sometimes only a best 
choice, not a good choice. With Jabiluka testing how Australia honours 
both its indigenous peoples and its superlative natural environment, 
Labor’s Kim Beazley has fallen short of the categorical assurance 
needed  . 
Instead he offers equivocal hope that Labor would stop the mine after 
October 3rd This equivocation will warrant many undecided voters putting 
Labor before the Coalition on October 3rd. But the best assurance on 
Jabiluka in the Senate is to put the Greens first. If Labor is elected 
we will be in the balance of power. We will insist Kim Beazley stop 
the mine.

  

  A word on One Nation which wants to mine Jabiluka too. We Greens have 
tackled One Nation hardest in the Senate because of its racism and divisiveness. 
When I first moved to have PM Howard name Ms Hanson and condemn her 
bigotry, none of the other parties would back my call. That is history. 
Cheryl Kernot called it a stunt.

  

  Voters should know now, however, that One Nation is a guns—and-all 
anti-environment outfit. It would mine Jabliuka. It would go much further 
and open Australia’s national parks to logging. The best antidote 
to One Nation is the Greens.

  

  As we Greens will fight to stop the Jabiluka mine outright; so we 
will fight for Australia’s wild forests against Labor and the Coalition 
policy of increased Woodchipping.

  

  In Tasmania it is the Jabiluka company North, again, which is the 
major destroyer of the forests, including world heritage value forests. 
We will fight to end its destruction of the nation’s heirloom natural 
heritage. I, for one, will continue to join the daring and committed 
young Australians who face huge fines and even jail to peacefully protest 
against the forest carnage from Western Australian to East Gippsland. 
I am not just a Senate seat warmer. My heart is in Australia's great 
environmental heritage.

  

  To see nature as our essential companion on this small planet, to 
be cherished and protected for its own sake as well as ours, is, it 
seems to me, basic to any politician’s responsibilities. Yet, the 
Prime Minister has reduced his responsibility to chequebook environmentalism. 
To ‘greenwash’ politics.

  

  Dee Margetts and I have added much—needed focus, colour and fairness 
to the Senate. We take the strongest stand on Indigenous rights. Unlike 
the ALP we will continue to strive for the right of Indigenous Australians 
to negotiate when developments like cotton crops, broadscale plantations, 
quarries and dams threaten their lands.

  

  The Wik legislation stole those rights. While it is not ALP policy 
to rescind the Wik 10-point plan, it is Greens policy to do so.

  

  Australia’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Island peoples should also be recognised in the constitution. They should 
also be ensured representation in the nation’s parliament, as ar  e New Zealand’s Maori 
people.

  

  We Greens are actively committed to the rights and freedoms of Australia’s 
neighbours. So, when President Clinton visited our parliament on his 
way to meet the Premier of China, I called on him to raise the issue 
of freedom for the Tibetan people.

  

  We have taken a stand in the Senate, time and again, for the people 
of Tibet, East Timor, West Papua, Burma and Bougainville.

  

  At home, we celebrate our cultural diversity and promote freedom from 
discrimination for all Australians, including our ethnic communities, 
disabled people and the gay and lesbian community -- where, for example, 
national reform is required to end discrimination in the laws relating 
to property and superannuation. The Greens are Australia’s only political 
party with a majority of women in its state and federal representation. 
We will by example, not just by platitude, strive to ensure women fill 
half the places in Australia's parliaments and boardrooms.

  

  Education is another Greens priority.

  

  We would take another $2 billion of John Howard’s polluting $5 billion, 
and put it into education which, of course, also means job creation. 
This would revitalise the nation’s public education systems, ensuring 
free access by every Australian to pre school, primary, secondary and 
tertiary education. It would take Australia from nearly last to amongst 
the front rank of the OECD nations in terms of per-capita investment 
in education. We would encourage all young Australians into tertiary 
education to raise their prospects for the work, self-esteem and fulfilment 
they deserve.

  

  We would boost small business through the national 
business enterprise program. The Greens introduced this program as local 
employment initiatives to Tasmania, the state with Australia’s worst 
unemployment figures. On a shoestring budget, it promotes smal  l business which, unlike 
the multinationals, puts its profits back into the local community. 
Greens initiatives have created more than 1000 jobs in the island state’s 
most depressed towns, helping reduce youth unemployment and rewarding 
people with good ideas for business.

  

  And whatever happened to the republic? The Greens will drive this 
issue back onto the agenda. Last year I used my casting vote in the 
Senate to ensure the Constitutional Convention went ahead. In particular, 
if Australia elects a Labor Government on October 3  rd , we 
will press for immediate action to bring in the republic and so enable 
an Australian head of state to open the Sydney Olympics two years from 
now.

  

  Much has been said of the Democrats and the balance of power. But 
if Labor is elected, Mr Beazley will need the Greens, besides the Democrats, 
to get legislation through the Senate. The Greens will be the effective 
balance of power. We will, I assure you, Green up Labor on issues like 
social justice, overseas aid, putting the republic back on the agenda 
and, not least, turning around Labor’s own appalling track record 
on the environment in the 1990s.

  

  We will pursue Labor to change from its weak past position on East 
Timor and Tibet for example so that Australia insists on the right of 
a free vote for independence in each.

  

  Besides stopping the Jabiluka uranium mine in its tracks, we will 
insist Labor turn around its past failure to protect Australia’s forests. 
We will drive Labor to achieve a positive target for greenhouse gas 
reduction and its current policies which fall short on native title 
rights and immigrant welfare.

  

  Ladies and Gentlemen, there are two things that bring both the big 
parties together: raising their own salaries and rigging the system 
to get rid of competition.

  

  With then Green colleague Gerry Bates, I was outside the Tasmanian 
House of Assembly in 1986 when the Liberal and Labor parties got together, 
suspended standing orders and zapped through a bill for a 15% payrise, 
without debate, in 6 minutes flat. That should be in the Guinness Book 
of Records.

  

  This year Labor and Liberal used their numbers in the Tasmanian parliament 
to rig the electoral system to oust the Greens, led by the state’s 
most constructive political leader, Christine Mime. Despite this big-party 
gerrymander, and against the odds, Peg Putt retained her seat in Denison.

  

  The next target? The Senate. Two weeks ago we sent a questionnaire 
to the Labor and Coalition leaders on a range of issues affecting all 
Australians. Out of a hundred, we’ve scored Kim Beazley the almost-failed 
score of 51. But John Howard could manage just 3 points out of 100. 
From the environment to education his stock in trade answer to ideas 
other than the GST is ‘no!’

  

  Significantly, to the question of whether he would guarantee not changing 
the Senate voting system, without first asking Australians at a referendum, 
he replied with a flat ‘no!’. Mr Beazley more coyly said that Labor 
had ‘no intention of doing such a thing.’ Well, not yet.

  

  If John Howard ever wins control of the Senate, he will rig the voting 
system to get rid of minor parties and independents. He will not ask 
the people. He and his Liberal cabinet will gut the fairest voting system 
in Canberra, just as they did in Tasmania. Whatever you vote for the 
Reps, do not vote for the big parties in the Senate. Instead of allowing 
them to turn the Senate into a rubber stamp, stamp your feet at the 
ballot box on October 3rd and put the Greens, defenders of the Senate, 
first.

  

  By the way, I am often asked if voting Green risks wasting a vote. 
This is not so. Quite to the contrary, if the Green candidate is not 
elected, your vote goes on to the next party or candidate of your choice 
as a whole vote. In this way, voting Green can be double value.

  

  The other night, in the leaders’ debate on TV, Mr Howard at one 
stage clasped the right upper quadrant of his abdomen and said that 
he felt “in here” that the GST is right for Australia. Well, as 
a one time GP I know that when someone’s tender spot is down there, 
it is the liver which is likely to be inflamed, not the heart.

  

  My heart, our Green heart, is in re-orienting 
politics to focus on our vision of Australia as a safe, clean, natural 
country, leading in environmental technology in the new century, a haven 
of justice and tolerance in this turbulent world.

  

  Once again, le  t me give you the commitment that in all that we do, including tackling 
every parliamentary question, we will bring this question to the fore: 
“will Australians, 100 years from now, thank us for doing this?" 
If parliament can’t say yes to that question or is unsure, it should 
not proceed.

  

  This is our optimistic credo for shaping Australia, taking all Australians, 
including all generations to come, into account in all we do.

  

  Ladies and Gentlemen, on October 3rd I urge you to buck the old politics 
and go for the party of new ideas for the new millenium. Vote 1 ,The 
Greens
