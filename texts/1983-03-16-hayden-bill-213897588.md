 REPORT ON 'YELLOW RAIN' SPECIMENS

 After consulting the Minister for Defence/ I have authorised the release t h i s  morning of the report 

 of "The Examination of 'Yellow Rain' Specimens Received  at M RL in April 1982" by H.D. Crone of the Organic  Chemical Division of the Defence Science and Technology  Organisation/ Department of Defence.

 The report is based on an analysis of specimens 

 of leaves and pebbles obtained from a Laotian refugee  leader in 1982 and reputed to bear residue of chemical a t t a ck .

 The refugee leader concerned said that the 

 specimens had been recently brought across the Thai-  Laotian border to the camp by refugees from Laos.

 At the request of Foreign A ff a i r s /  the Materials 

 Research Laboratories of the Defence Department completed  a nalysis of the specimens and reported that "no s i g n i f i c a n t  

 t o x i c i t y  could be found. The items were fakes".

 It should be borne in mind that the analysis 

 and findings re la ted to one set of specimens alone.

 It does not n e c e s s a r il y  follow that a l l  

 s o- c al l e d 'yellow r a i n '  charges have been disproved by 

 these findings...

 Copies of the report can be obtained from the 

 Department of Foreign A f f a i r s /  News and Media Section.
