 INDONESIAN AUTHORITIES AND AFP STOP MORE BOAT  PEOPLE   

 The Hon Dr Sharman Stone MP   Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 Indonesian Authorities supported by the Australian Federal Police have detained a group of  41 Afghan asylum seekers heading for Australia at Bau Bau Bay in South East Sulawesi.  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Dr Sharman Stone said, “This brings to a  total of 16 the number of boatloads of asylum seekers since August 2008 intercepted by the  Indonesians.  

 The successful intercept was a joint operation carried out by Indonesian Authorities and  Australian Federal Police.  

 The Authorities also detained six Indonesians including the boat Captain and three crew as  well as two other men believed to be in the smuggling ring.  

 “Again this highlights the need for adequate resourcing of border security operations and  partnering with the Indonesian authorities,” said Sharman Stone.  

 “People smuggling continues to be a major global criminal activity, exploiting people with  the cash and contacts desperate to start a new life.  

 “The smugglers have no regard for the safety of their clients at sea.  

 “The Australian Government must crank up its message into the region about the sanctions  for those caught people smuggling,” Dr Stone said.
