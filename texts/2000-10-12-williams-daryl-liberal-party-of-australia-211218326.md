 BIGGEST CONSEQUENTIALS BILL TO ESTABLISH NEW MERITS TRIBUNAL

 Today I introduced the Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2000 into the Parliament.

 This is the companion Bill to the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2000, which I introduced on 28 June 2000. It is believed that this is the biggest consequential and transitional provisions Bill introduced to Parliament since Federation - making more than 2000 amendments to more than 200 Acts.

 The Administrative Review Tribunal Bill provides for the establishment of a new merits review tribunal, the Administrative Review Tribunal. The new Tribunal will review administrative decisions on the merits and will replace the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal.

 Together, these Bills represent the most significant reform in 25 years of the Commonwealth merits review system.

 The Government has honoured commitments made to the veterans community and the Veterans’ Review Board will remain in existence. Veterans will have a right to seek review by the new Tribunal of decisions made by the Board.

 The Consequential and Transitional Provisions Bill amends Acts that confer jurisdiction on the tribunals that are to be abolished so that the jurisdiction is transferred to the new Tribunal. It makes minor

 amendments to many of those Acts to facilitate the change to the new Tribunal.

 It also provides for the smooth and efficient transition from the existing tribunals to the new regime. The Government is committed to ensuring that applicants are not disrupted by the change, irrespective of what stage their matters are at when the new regime comes into operation on 1 July next year, and that their existing rights are preserved.

 The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee will examine the Consequential and Transitional Provisions Bill, together with the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill, and has indicated that it will report on the first sitting day in 2001.
