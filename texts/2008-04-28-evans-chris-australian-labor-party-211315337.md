 Independent committee to review citizenship test 

 Monday, 28 April 2008 

 An independent committee of seven eminent Australians will review the  citizenship test, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris  Evans, announced today. 

 Former Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Secretary Richard Woolcott  AC will chair the Citizenship Test Review Committee, which will examine the  operation and effectiveness of the test since its introduction on 1 October last  year. 

 'The Government is committed to maintaining the citizenship test, but now that  it has been in place for six months, it is timely to review it to make sure it is  achieving its proper purpose as an effective pathway for residents to become  citizens,' Senator Evans said. 

 'The committee will examine aspects of the content and operation of the  citizenship test, including the experiences of applicants and the impact on  citizenship applications, and consider ways to improve its operation and  effectiveness. 

 'The committee will be chaired by Mr Woolcott AC, a former diplomat with a  long and distinguished public service career and an excellent ambassador for  multicultural relations.' 

 The six other members appointed to the independent committee are former  Olympian Rechelle Hawkes; SBS director Paula Masselos; refugee advocate  Julianna Nkrumah; Australia Day Council CEO Warren Pearson; former Chief  of Navy Vice Admiral Rtd Chris Ritchie AO RANR; and legal expert Professor  Kim Rubenstein. 

 'The committee will consult actively with the Australian community to ensure  views from the public are heard and considered, so I urge people to take the  opportunity to provide feedback,' Senator Evans said.   

 'It is important to Government that stakeholders and interested members of  the public are given the opportunity to contribute to the development of future  policy directions regarding the citizenship test. 

 'The Rudd Government believes that a citizenship test can play a valuable  role in both encouraging people to find out more about our great nation as  well as understanding the responsibilities and privileges which being an  Australian citizen brings. 

 'A test is also a useful mechanism for determining whether a person meets  the general legal requirements for becoming an Australian - including whether  they possess a basic knowledge of the English language.' 

 The committee began work on the review today (28 April) and is due to report  back to the Minister by mid year. Further information is available at  www.citizenshiptestreview.gov.au or by writing to the Citizenship Testing  Review Committee, PO Box 1179, Belconnen ACT 2616.
