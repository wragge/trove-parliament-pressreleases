 The Impact of External Administrative Law Review: Tribunals   

 

 Linda Pearsonâ   

 

 

 External  review  of  administrative  decisions  on  the  merits  is  an  accepted  part  of  the   Australian  administrative  law  landscape.   The  reforms  made  in  the  Commonwealth   sphere  during  the  1970s  included  the  establishment  of  the  Administrative  Appeals   Tribunal,  and  lead  to  the  creation  and  development  of  generalist  and  specialist  review   tribunals both in the Commonwealth and the States.  The significance of these reforms is  still  recognised  by,  and  influencing  reforms  in,  other  jurisdictions.   Most  recently,  the   Leggatt  Review  of  tribunals  in  the  United  Kingdom  drew  on  the  Australian  experience,   commenting:1   

 We  found  general  agreement  that  the  AAT  had  had  a  thoroughly  beneficial  effect  on  the   development  of  administrative  law,  establishing  a  valuable  tradition  of  individual  treatment  of   cases,  and  of  test  cases.  That  had  enabled  the  development  of  a  distinctive  process  of  merits   review which all tribunals used in their separate jurisdictions.   

 Review  of  administrative  decisions  by  an  external,  independent,  tribunal  which  would   have the power to substitute  the  “correct or preferable” decision was seen by the  Kerr  Committee  in  1971  as  the  key  to  correcting  “error  or  impropriety  in  the  making  of   administrative  decisions  affecting  a  citizen’s  rights”2.  The  focus  was  on  redressing   individual grievances, and only incidentally in playing a role in improving administrative  decision-making.   The  Kerr  Committee  expressed  the  hope  that  the  recommended   reforms should “tend to minimise the amount of administrative error”, and that the right to  challenge administrative decisions should “stimulate administrative efficiency”.3   

 By the time of the ARC Better Decisions report,4 improving the quality and consistency of  agency decision-making was seen as one of four specific objectives of the merits review  system,  the  others  being  providing  the  correct  and  preferable  decision  in  individual   cases,  providing  an  accessible  mechanism  for  merits  review,  and  enhancing  the   openness and accountability of government.

 This paper raises three questions for consideration:   

 1.  Why  are  we  concerned  about  the  impact  of  external  tribunal  review,  whether  on  an   individual level or on administration more generally?  2. What do we mean by “impact”, and how might we measure it?  3. What do we know about how agencies respond to tribunal review decisions?   

 

 1.  Why does impact matter?   

 External  review  by tribunals  is  only one  part  of the  Australian  system  of  administrative   law  (other  key  elements  being  the  courts,  and  the  Ombudsman).  And  those  external   review  mechanisms  are  themselves  only  a  part  of  what  has  come  to  be  described  as   “administrative  justice”,  a  term  which  has  many  meanings.5  Adler  has  defined   administrative  justice  as  referring  to  “the  principles  that  can  be  used  to  evaluate  the   justice  inherent  in  administrative  decision-making”.  Those  principles  comprise  both   procedural  fairness,  concerned  with  the  process  of  decision  making,  and  substantive   justice, which refers to the outcomes of the decision making process.6  Adler has argued  that  the  external  review  mechanisms  are  not  particularly  effective  on  their  own  in   achieving administrative justice:7   

 This is, in part, because few of those who experience injustice actually appeal to courts, tribunals  or ombudsmen; in part because court, tribunal, and ombudsman decisions have a limited impact  on  the corpus of administrative decision-making. As a  result, as Ison (1999:23)  points out, “the   total volume of injustice is likely to be much greater among those who accept initial decisions than  among those who complain or appeal”.   

 While  external  review  may  have  a  limited  role  to  play  on  its  own  in  achieving   administrative  justice,  it  is  important  to  acknowledge  that  the  various  external  review   mechanisms  require  continuing  commitment  of  significant  resources,  financial  and   otherwise,  by  governments  and  individuals.   They  also  represent  for  many  individuals   the  most  direct  opportunity  available  to  participate  in,  and  question,  government   decisions  which  affect  them.   So  there  is  a  need  to  understand  the  impact  of  external   review, both in the individual case, and more broadly.   

 There is a clear shift from Kerr to Better Decisions in acknowledging that tribunal review  could,  and  should,  have  consequences  beyond  the  resolution  of  an  individual  dispute.   There are several explanations for that. Sir Gerard Brennan, as the first President of the  AAT, played an early and crucial role.  In the second Annual Report of the AAT in 1978  Sir  Gerard  noted  that  “[t]he  way  in  which  the  system  can  serve  the  individual  and  the   administration must be learned, and learning  is difficult”.8 Sir Gerard saw the tribunal’s   influence on administrative decision-making as arising primarily from its determination of

 individual cases, and through the quality of its reasons for decision. In 1979 Sir Gerard  stated:9   

 The objective of administrative review on the merits is to improve the quality of decision-making,  both in the particular case and, by precept, generally.   

 In  1996,  at  a  seminar  held  to  mark  the  20th  anniversary  of  the  AAT,  Sir  Gerard   commented:10    

 The AAT was intended not only to give better administrative justice in individual cases but also to  secure  an  improvement  in  primary  administrative  decision-making.  This  had  to  be  achieved  by   the quality of the AAT’s reasoning. Departments, like any organised human activity, tend to have  an inward focus and the corporate culture tends to be the most powerful influence on the conduct  of  individuals  engaged  in  that  activity.  External  review  is  only  as  effective  if  it  infuses  the   corporate  culture  and  transforms  it.  The  AAT’s  function  of  inducing  improvement  in  primary   administration  would  not  be  performed  merely  by  the  creation  of  external  review.  Bureaucratic   intransigence  would  not  be  moved  unless  errors  were  clearly  demonstrated  and  a  method  of   reaching the correct or preferable decision was clearly expounded. AAT decisions would have a  normative  effect  on  administration  only  if  the  quality  of  those  decisions  was  such  as  to   demonstrate to  the  repositories of primary administrative power the  validity of the reasoning by  which they, no less than the AAT, were bound.  Any effect that the AAT might produce in primary  administration would depend upon the reasoning expressed in the reasons for AAT decisions.   

 Other factors were at play during the 1980s and into the 1990s, not the least of which  was  the  changing  focus  of  public  administration.   Chief  Justice  Gleeson  noted  in  his   speech marking the 30th anniversary of the AAT in 2006 that the AAT does not operate  in a static context, and commented:11   

 There  have  been  major  developments,  since  1976,  in  the  principles  and  practice  of  public   administration.  Methods  of  performance  review and  accountability  within  the  public  sector  have   changed,  and  continue  to  change.  Privatisation,  and  the  outsourcing  of  functions,  have  placed   many  activities  affecting  citizens  outside  the  scope  of  the  legislative  scheme  conceived  in  the   1970s.   

 Adler has described these changes as a challenge to the bureaucratic, professional and  legal  models  of  decision-making  accepted  in  the  early  1980s,  by  a  managerial  model   associated with the rise of the new public management, a consumerist model focussing  on  increased  participation  of  consumers  in  decision-making,  and  a  market  model  that   emphasises  consumer  choice.12  The  consequence  of  these  challenges  is  a  continuing   focus  on  cost,  and  efficiency.   For  example,  the  2007  Productivity Commission  Report  on  Government  Services  on  its  Review  of  Government  Service  Provision,  focuses  on   outcomes  from  the  provision  of  government  services  -  whether  through  government   funding  of  service  providers  or  the  provision  of  government  services  directly  -  in  an

 attempt  to  measure  whether  service  objectives  have  been  met.   Outcomes  are  to  be   measured against indicators of equity, effectiveness, and efficiency.13   

 More  generally,  as  the  administrative  review  system  has  become  entrenched,  more  is   expected  of  it  than  simply  delivering  justice  in  the  individual  case.   There  is  an   expectation that tribunal decisions and decision-making have a role to play in ensuring  that there is fairness and consistency in the treatment of individuals by government; that  there  is  an  improvement  in  the  quality  and  consistency  of  agency  decision-making   beyond the individual case; and that there is an improvement in administration generally  through the adoption of the values inherent in administrative review.14    

 2. How do we measure “impact”?   

 There is a growing body of empirical work, much of it coming from the United Kingdom,  assessing the impact of judicial review.  Some of the empirical studies have focussed on  the  impact  of  judicial  review  as  a  mechanism  for  handling  individual  grievances,   examining the ultimate outcomes for applicants. Others have focussed on judicial review  as a mechanism for addressing systemic bureaucratic failings.15 Attempts to understand  or measure “impact” in this context have shifted between considering judicial review as a  process, to bureaucratic reaction to particular decisions or series of decisions, or to the  impact  of  judicial  review  as  a  system  of  values  and  legal  norms.16   The  central   requirement is that there is a clear understanding of what is being evaluated: impact of  what, and impact on what.   

 Any  evaluation  of  impact,  whether  it  be  of  judicial  review  or  tribunal  review,  must   acknowledge  that  external  review  is  only  one  influence  on  administrative  decision-making.   The  “administrative  soup”17  of  influences  on  decision-making  includes  factors   such as resources, policies, and personal pressures, and the principles and values that  lawyers associate with external review change as they mix with those other factors.     

 While  many  of  the  approaches  to  assessing  impact  of  judicial  review  are  helpful,   evaluating the impact of tribunal review raises some different issues.  Judicial review as  a  process  involves  the  interaction  between  two  clearly  separate  branches  of   government, as expressed by Brennan J in Church of Scientology v Woodward (1982)  154 CLR 25 at 70:   

 Judicial  review is  neither  more  nor  less  than  the  enforcement  of  the  rule  of  law over  executive   action;  it  is  the  means  by  which  executive  action  is  prevented  from  exceeding  the  powers  and   functions  assigned  to  the  executive  by  law  and  the  interests  of  the  individual  are  protected   accordingly.

 The relationship between a tribunal and the agency whose decisions it reviews is more  complex  than  that  between  a  court  and  that  agency,  and  any  attempt  to  evaluate  the   impact of tribunal review must reflect those complexities.   

 Tribunals are part of the system of adjudication, and they resolve disputes by methods of  application  of  law  to  facts  similar  to  those  used  by  the  courts.18  The  principle  that   tribunals should not seek to defend their decisions on review, but simply submit to such  order as the court may make is perhaps a reflection of that.19 However, those tribunals  which  review  administrative  decisions  on  the  merits  do  so,  most  clearly  in  the  federal   context, as an exercise of executive power.  The High Court decision in Craig v South  Australia (1995)  185  CLR  163  draws  a  distinction  between  inferior  courts  and  other   decision-makers,  including  tribunals,  for  the  purposes  of  identifying  jurisdictional  error,   and  there  is  now  little  room  for  a  tribunal  to  make  an  error  of  law  which  is  not   jurisdictional.20   Under this approach tribunals are clearly part of the executive, and are  accountable to the courts in the same way as other executive decision-makers.  While  tribunals  are  independent  of  the  decision-making  structure  within  which  primary   administrative decisions are made, they are still part of that structure - and some have  described  that  position  as  at  its  apex.21   However,  tribunals  occupy  a  distinctive  role   within the administrative decision-making structure.  Tribunals are not simply correcting  errors (whether of fact or law) made by the primary decision-maker:22   

 Tribunals overturn departmental decisions for many reasons including: new evidence; applicants  taking  the  process  more  seriously  once  they  have  received  a  negative  decision  from  the   department; changes in the law due, for example, to court decisions; applicants feeling the need  to defend their credibility; and different exercise of a discretion.   

 Further, the ability of a tribunal to depart from government policy and guidelines sets it  apart from primary decision-makers.  In this regard, the traditional dichotomy of tribunals  and  primary  decision-makers  needs  to  be  revisited,  to  reflect  the  development  of   government  agencies  which  act  simply  as  deliverer  of  services,  with  the  real  policy   framework provided from outside.23   

 3. What do we know about impact, or how agencies respond to tribunal review?   

 In Australia, after some early work on evaluating tribunals,24 Creyke and McMillan have  led the way in evaluating impact.  Their study of the outcomes of judicial review focussed

 on outcomes for applicants. 25 The related part of their study on executive perceptions of  administrative  law  looked  at  impact  more  broadly,  and  included  responses  to  tribunal   review as well as the other external review mechanisms.26 Apart from this work (referred  to below), we are left primarily with anecdotal observations, to a large extent contained  in  the  proceedings  of  the  AIAL,  and  those  of  the  1987  conference  which  provided  the   impetus for its formation.27 The many contributions to those conferences and seminars  over the years reflect a range of perspectives of external merits review, from impatience,  and  sometimes  hostility,  to  a  more  positive  recognition  of  the  role  of  external  merits   review in clarifying principles and exposing deficiencies.     

 Cost has always been a concern, as reflected in the criticisms made by then Minister of  Finance Senator Peter Walsh in 1987 of “the capricious nature and considerable cost” of  some AAT decisions.28  Senator Walsh was referring to both the direct costs of running  the  system,  and  the  broader  costs  to  public  programs  of  some  AAT  decisions.   While   there  was  early  acknowledgement  that  the  system  would  cost  money,  there  has  been   little analysis of the real costs and benefits of administrative review.    

 The costs of running the tribunal system are difficult to calculate, as different measures  are  used  by  each  tribunal,  and  administrative  arrangements  with  other  agencies   complicate the picture.  However, based on the information provided in Annual Reports  for 2005-2006, the following points can be made.   

 In the federal sphere, total operating costs for the AAT, Social Security Appeals Tribunal  (SSAT), Veterans Review Board (VRB), Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and Refugee  Review  Tribunal  (RRT)  were  close  to  $90,000,000,  and  these  tribunals  finalised  a   combined 30,356 matters.  The average cost per finalisation ranged from $1563 for the  VRB  to  $5962  for  the  RRT.  The  State  sphere  is  more  complex,  as  tribunals  combine   both  merits  review  and  other  jurisdictions,  including  civil  claims.   The  NSW   Administrative Decisions Tribunal has a retail leases jurisdiction; the Victorian Civil and  Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) includes planning decision-making (which is handled in  NSW by the Land and Environment Court) and guardianship (which in NSW is handled  by  the  Guardianship  Tribunal).   The  VCAT  and  the  WA  State  Administrative  Tribunal   both deal with residential tenancy issues, which in NSW are handled by the Consumer  Trading  and  Tenancy  Tribunal.  The  residential  tenancy  decisions  swamp  all  other   jurisdictions in VCAT, and also in those heard in the NSW CTTT.     

 The total operating cost of the federal tribunal system, some $90 million in 2005-2006,  obviously does not include the costs to the agencies whose decisions they review, or to  the  individuals  who  apply  to,  or  appear  before,  them.  The  total  number  of  matters,   30,356 (which would include some double counting, for applications made to the AAT for  review  of  decisions  of  the  SSAT  and  VRB),  is  a  small  proportion  of  the  number  of

 decisions  made by Commonwealth decision-makers which might affect the interests  of  an  individual  or  organisation.   To  take  the  social  security  jurisdiction  as  an  example,   Centrelink has over 25,000 staff and 6.5 million customers; sends 90 million letters each  year,  and  distributes  $60  billion  in  payments.29  In  2002-3  there  were  a  minimum  of   109,000  reconsiderations  by  the  original  decision-maker,  which  flowed  on  to  39,383   reviews  by  authorised  review  officers.30   In  that  year,  the  SSAT  received  9,576   applications, and 1,869 applications were made to the AAT.    

 It is equally difficult to compare results.  For the SSAT, in 2005-2006 35.3% of decisions  in jurisdictions involving at least 10% of the tribunal’s work were set aside or varied,31 as  a  percentage  of  set  aside,  varied  or  affirmed.32   There  were  appeals  to  the  AAT  from   21.7% of appealable decisions (7% by the Secretary); of those, 20.4% were set aside or  varied. More than half the matters determined in the AAT are by consent, and in those  matters 57.1% are set aside or varied.  For those matters that proceed to a decision, in  28.7% of cases the decision under review is set aside or varied.  In the VRB, 28.2% of  entitlement  decisions  are  set  aside,  while  in  48%  of  assessment  decisions  the  rate   increased, and reduced in 0.7% of matters. For those matters that go on to the AAT, the  percentage  set  aside  or  varied  by  consent  is  similar  to  the  overall  rate;  for  matters   finalised  by  decision,  however,  36.9%  are  set  aside  or  varied.  In  the  MRT  51%  of   decisions  are  in  the  applicant’s  favour  (ranging  from  22%  of  decisions  concerning   bridging  visas  to  68%  of  partner  visa  decisions).  For  the  RRT,  an  average  of  30%  of   matters  are  determined  in  the  applicant’s  favour  (ranging  from  2%  for  applicants  from   Malaysia, to 97% from Iraq).     

 The  general  point  that  can  be  made  about  these  statistics  is  that  an  individual  has  a   reasonable prospect of having an adverse decision changed, and that this remains so if  there  is  more  than  once  chance  at  review,  and  those  opportunities  are  pursued.    However, those individuals who directly benefit in this way are only a small proportion of  those  affected  by  administrative  decision-making.   The  direct  costs,  and  benefits  to   those  individuals  who  obtain  a  more  favourable  outcome,  are  only  part  of  the  picture.   Chief Justice Spigelman has warned against the dangers of “pantometry”, or the belief  that  everything  can  be  counted:  “…not  everything  that  counts  can  be  counted.  Some   matters can only be judged - that is to say, they can only be assessed in a qualitative  way”.33  Qualitative assessments of tribunal review would include fairness, and the value  of  participation  of  individuals  in  decisions  which  affect  them,  sometimes  for  the  first   time.34   

 The  ARC  commented  in  Better  Decisions  on  the  need  to  foster  cultural  change  within   agencies,  noting  that  “at  the  primary  decision  making  level  many  agency  decision

 makers remain sceptical of the value of merits review”.35  This may be an unwarranted  assumption,  as  the  empirical  research  conducted  by  Creyke  and  McMillan  since  then   has found a high level of approval of external review.36  The outcomes were summarised  by Creyke in the following terms:37   

 Overall there was a firm rejection of the following propositions, all of which were couched in the  negative. That is, four out of five respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed with the proposition  that  external  review  bodies  undermine  government  policy;  more  than  half  disagreed  with  the   suggestion  that  external  review  bodies  give  too  little  focus  to  the  economic  and  managerial   imperatives  of  government;  and  nearly  two-thirds  rejected  the  proposition  that  external  review   bodies give too much emphasis to individual rights when they make decisions.   

 However,  although  this  was  not  the  majority  view,  a  significant  number  (around  one-third)  of   respondents  were  critical  of  external  review  bodies,  particularly  tribunals,  for  their  lack  of   understanding  of  the  context  for  and  pressures  on  government  decision-making,  and  just  over   half the respondents considered that external review undesirably prolongs disputes.   

 In 1987 Derek Volker, then Secretary of the Department of Social Security, commented  on how few people had used the various avenues of access to information or review of  decisions: explained in part by the complexity of the system, but also by what he saw as  rapid and significant improvements driven by external scrutiny of decisions in the quality  of  decisions,  the  reasons  for  decision,  and  clarification  of  legislative  provisions  and   policies.38  In 1998 Michael Sassella, then First Assistant Secretary in the Department of  Social Security, agreed that clarification of the legislation had been positive, however, he  was  critical  of the  tribunals’  “lack  of sufficient  interest  in  government  and  departmental   policy and practice”.39  This criticism echoes a concern expressed in 1993 by Kees de  Hoog, who commented that the tribunals involved in review of social security decisions  tended to focus on legal technicalities and the individual facts before them, rather than  on consistency and the needs for efficiency at the primary decision-making level.40   

 These  comments  reflect  the  impact  of  tribunal  review  as  a  mechanism  for  handling   individual grievances.  Consideration of tribunal review as a mechanism for addressing  broader  administrative  issues  has  so  far  focussed  on  two  factors:  the  influence  of  a   tribunal’s  reasons  for  decision,  and  the  need  to  build  a  bridge  between  tribunals  and   government agencies.    

 Tribunal reasons   

 Better  Decisions  identified  two  ways  in  which  review  tribunal  decisions  could  have  a   broader  effect  on  agency  decision  making:  by  ensuring  that  tribunal  decisions  are   reflected  in  other  similar  decisions,  and  by  taking  into  account  review  decisions  in  the

 development of agency policy and legislation.41 The ARC argued that agencies need to  have organisational structures and procedures to enable them to take account of tribunal  decisions.   The “appropriate organisational systems” identified by the ARC required that  agencies have in place processes for:42 

 â¢  receiving  review  tribunal  decisions  and  analysing  their  potential  effects  on   agency decision making (including determining whether further review should be  sought of, or an appeal made against, particular review tribunal decisions);  â¢  effective  and  timely  distribution  of  relevant  review  tribunal  decisions  (or  a  

 synopsis  of  decisions  where  that  is  sufficient),  and  identification  of  changes  to   legislation, guidelines and policies which should arise from those decisions; and  â¢  training  staff  (particularly  primary  decision  makers)  in  appropriate  aspects  of   administrative law, including the role of external merits review.   

 The  ARC  discussed  appropriate  agency  responses  to  tribunal  decisions,  noting  that   there  is  a  range  of  possible  responses,  including  a  change  in  agency  policies  or   guidelines.   The  ARC  accepted  that  there  may  be  legitimate  reasons  why  an  agency   which  believes  that  a  tribunal  decision  is  not  correct does  not pursue  available  appeal   rights  or  seek  Parliamentary  clarification  of  its  policy  intention.   However,  the  ARC   commented that it is unsatisfactory for an agency to respond to a tribunal decision which  it believes to be incorrect only by advising its decision makers not to follow the decision  in  future  similar  cases.  Such  a  response  does  not  resolve  any  difference  of  opinion   between  the  agency  and  the  tribunal,  may  lead  to  different  results  for  individuals   depending on how far they pursue their appeal rights, and may diminish the credibility of  the  tribunal  in  the  eyes  of  both  agency  decision  makers  and  tribunal  users.43    Appropriate responses would be to amend policy or seek an amendment to the law; to  appeal  or  seek  review  of  the  tribunal  decision;  or  to  make  a  public  statement  of  their   position in relation to the tribunal decision.44   

 The  other  side  of  the  equation  is  that  tribunals  need  to  deliver  “high  quality  and   consistent decisions”.45 Bayne has identified three ways in which tribunals can, through  the process of making decisions, have a normative effect on primary administration:46   

 First, in relation to the process followed, to reduce the possibility of error or injustice; secondly, in  relation to the correct application of the law; and, thirdly, in relation to the kinds of considerations  and policies which inform the making of discretionary judgments. 

 

 Creyke  and  McMillan  observed  from  their  empirical  work  that  there  was  general   satisfaction with the quality, length and comprehensibility of the reasons for decision of  review  bodies  (courts  and  tribunals).   However  there  were  some  concerns  expressed   about variations in the quality of reasons, and greater approval of reasons provided by  the  courts  than  those  provided  by  the  tribunals,  with  the  AAT  faring  better  than  the   specialist  tribunals.47   The  study  included  questions  intended  to  gauge  the  agencies’

 responses  to  the  recommendations  of  the  ARC.  Those  questions  elicited  the  rather   disappointing  outcome,  that  only  one  third  of  agencies  had  address  the  specific   recommendations  concerning  appropriate  responses  to  tribunal  decisions,  or  the   recommendations for implementing appropriate organisational processes.   

 

 Communication between tribunals and agencies   

 The  Kerr  Committee  recommended  that  one  of  the  three  members  constituting  its   proposed  Administrative  Review  Tribunal  should  be  an  officer  of  the  department  or   agency whose decision was subject to review. This was seen as being of benefit to the  tribunal, as it “would ensure that particular knowledge of the area of administration which  produced  the  decision  under  review  would  be  available  to  the  Tribunal”.48   Feedback   from the tribunal to the agency was considered only in the context of the limited role that  the Kerr Committee perceived for review of government policy:49   

 It  may  also  be  desirable  that  the  Tribunal  should  be  empowered  to  transmit  to  the  appropriate   Minister the opinion of the Tribunal that although the decision sought to be reviewed was properly  based on government policy, government policy as applied in the particular case is operating in  an oppressive, discriminatory or otherwise unjust manner.   

 The AAT and the other merits review tribunals adopted quite a different role in deciding  whether or not to apply government policy.50  That led to criticism both of the tribunals’  independent  role  in  determining  the  legality  of  policy,  and  whether  its  application  in  a   particular case would result in injustice, and to charges that the tribunals were failing to  consider government policy at all.   Much of the force of these criticisms has waned, in  part because policy guidelines are now more readily available both to tribunals and the  public  as  a  result  of  the  requirements  of  Freedom  of  Information  legislation,  and   advances in technology.   

 The call for better communication between tribunals and agencies has been consistent  over  the  years,  and  has  come  from  all  quarters,  including  the  administration,51  the   tribunals,52  and  government.53   Tribunals  must  retain  independence  from  the  agencies   whose  decisions  they  review,  however  many  tribunals  are  closely  linked  with  those   agencies through funding and other administrative ties.  Most tribunals have established  liaison  procedures  with  relevant  agencies.   As  the  ALRC  noted  in  the  context  of  the

 ability of tribunal to obtain information from the department whose decision is subject to  review, formal and transparent links are less of a threat to independence than informal  links.54   Some  tribunals  now  have  formal  agreements  with  their  portfolio  agencies,   however these are not uniformly publicly available.  The Memorandum of Understanding  between  the  Department  of  Immigration  and  the  MRT  and  RRT  is  available  on  the   tribunals’ website, and includes provision for regular meetings. Much of the detail in this  Agreement  concerns  information  exchange,  technology,  and  financial  arrangements,   and  makes  minimal  reference  to  the  organisational  matters  raised  in  Better  Decisions.   Para  3.6  rather  cryptically  states  “The  agencies  [ie,  the  department  and  the  tribunals]   shall  endeavour  to  assist  each  other  in  increasing  the  quality  and  efficacy  of  decision   making and decision making processes”.      

 We do have some understanding of the processes by which some agencies respond to  review  tribunal  decisions.   At  the  2004  AIAL  National  Forum,  Pat  Turner  outlined  the   processes  for  consideration  of  SSAT  and  AAT  decisions  by  Centrelink  and  the  then   Department  of  Family  and  Community  Services.   Under  those  processes,  there  is   consultation  between  the  program  branches  and  the  Legal  Services  Branch  in   considering  whether  a  decision  of  the  tribunals  which  changes  the  original  decision   should be appealed.  Centrelink makes recommendations to client agencies both as to  whether  a  decision  should  be  challenged,  and  whether  policy  or  legislative  change  is   warranted.   Further,  the  SSAT  receives  copies  of  the  comments  on  individual  tribunal   decisions.55   The  Centrelink/SSAT  Administrative  Arrangements  Agreement  sets  out   comprehensive liaison and feedback arrangements, intended to facilitate the shared goal  of making the correct or preferable decision at either the primary stage or on review.   

 Overall, however, it is discouraging to note that while lawyers, administrators, tribunals  and  courts  have  been  talking  about  these  issues  for  thirty  years,  there  is  still  limited   evidence  beyond  the  anecdotal.   There  is  a  need  for  a  more  concerted  and  coherent   attempt to measure the effectiveness of the tribunals, and not just in terms of financial  cost.56  Creyke  and  McMillan  have  made  a  start,  however  their  review  of  executive   perceptions  addressed  all  external  review  avenues,  and  for  various  reasons  did  not   focus on outcomes for individual specialist tribunals.  Any future empirical work needs to  understand current feedback mechanisms, and to build on that in developing a protocol  for appropriate mechanisms for dialogue between tribunals and agencies.
