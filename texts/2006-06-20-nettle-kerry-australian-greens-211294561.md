 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 Vanstone confirms fate of 9 year old Afghan awaits all  refugee children if new immigration laws pass 

 

 Senator Nettle, 20th June 2006 

 In Senate question time today Senator Nettle asked the Minister for Immigration  Senator Vanstone to confirm that a refugee family picked up in the Torres Strait has  been held incommunicado and despite the 9 year old child undergoing surgery and  being seriously ill have been denied the right to apply for a visa. 

 The family arrived by boat in the Torres Strait on the 20th of May and were then  transferred to Brisbane where the child was admitted to the Royal Children's Hospital,  Brisbane where the 9 yr old boy has undergone surgery for a serious medical  condition. 

 "This case highlights the dangers of the offshore processing policy. Had this seriously  ill child developed his sickness a few weeks later he would have been on Nauru  thousands of kilometres from essential medical assistance," Senator Nettle said. 

 "This family is isolated, do not know their rights, have a very sick boy and still this  government wants to send them to Nauru. This will be the fate off all boat arrivals if  the government gets their way on the new migration laws. 

 "To make a political point this family who are already in Brisbane may be sent to  Nauru at a massive cost to the taxpayer and threatening the health of a 9 year old boy. 

 "If the Coalition backbenchers wanted a clear example of the kind of policy they are  being asked to support then they need look no further than this case. 

 "Current immigration polices are already dealing with families in a cruel manner. The  Greens continue to urge Coalition backbenchers to join us in opposing this kind of  politically motivated cruelty."

 TRANSCRIPT OF Question 

 NETTLE (2.43 pm)-My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration  and Multicultural Affairs. Can the minister confirm whether the Afghan family who  recently arrived by boat in the Torres Strait are still being held incommunicado in 

 Brisbane? Is it true that the 11-year-old boy has a serious medical condition and has  just had an operation with serious ongoing medical consequences? Is it also true that  the Red Cross has requested access to the family to check on their welfare but has so  far not been allowed to have any access? Will the minister grant this family a  humanitarian visa or a residence determination so that they can stay in Australia, 

 where their son's medical condition can be cared for, whilst their asylum claim is  assessed?  

 VANSTONE-These people arrived on Saibai Island in the Torres Strait some time  late in May-I think it was the 21st. It is true that the family were denied access to  visitors while they were in detention. People are entitled to decline visitors while they  are in detention and it is true that the nine-year-old boy is unwell. No decision has  been made on whether these people will be removed to Nauru, and that is certainly  not a short-term proposition. They did arrive at an excised offshore place and  therefore, according to the laws that we have in place at the moment-that is, offshore  processing-they are precluded from making an application under the Migration Act.  As you were here when that legislation was passed, I am sure you will understand  that, Senator. The department has facilitated the family's nine-year-old boy going to  the Royal Children's Hospital in Brisbane because he does have a particular condition,  which we are caring for, as you would expect we would. 

 NETTLE-Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Given that the Department of  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs responded to my question on notice last week  by saying that persons in Nauru or PNG are not under effective control of Australia in  terms of their day-to-day management, how can the government guarantee that  refugees like this family, who, under the new immigration laws, would be shipped off  to Nauru, will get proper assistance? What guarantees can the government provide  that refugees left to languish in Nauru will have the support of international agencies  when even here in Australia the Red Cross is being locked out from visiting these  detainees and assessing their welfare? 

 VANSTONE-First of all, these people are not being dealt with under any new  legislation. The new legislation has not passed. Thank you for the opportunity to  remind the Senate that these people are being dealt with under existing legislation, it  is not new legislation, because they arrived at an excised offshore place. We already  have offshore processing. It has been the most successful border protection policy that  we have had and it is important. What we are seeking to do in the bill that is now in  the other place is simply apply that existing policy to those few people who manage to  make it from an excised offshore island onto the mainland. I do not have advice as to  any refusal of the Red Cross by the department. I have been told that they have  declined some visitors, but it has not been indicated to me that they were from the Red  Cross, and it is certainly not indicated to me in my brief that the department has  declined a visit by the Red Cross. I will investigate that matter and get back to you on  that issue.
