 Media Release

 SENATOR THE HON. CHRISTOPHER ELLISON

 Minister for Justice and Customs Senator for Western Australia

 25 March 2001

 169 Illegals Detected by Customs The Australian Customs Vessel Wauri has intercepted an Indonesian vessel carrying 169 suspected illegal immigrants and four Indonesian crew near Ashmore Islands, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Chris Ellison, said today.

 Senator Ellison said the ACV Wauri had intercepted the vessel yesterday as it crossed into Australian waters. The 95 males, 42 females and 36 children all appeared to be of Middle Eastern origin.

 The Customs vessel was assisted by the Navy patrol boat HMAS Bunbury, which was at Ashmore Islands refuelling the ACV Wauri.

 "The circumstances of this interception again demonstrates that the close working relationship between Customs, the defence forces and other Federal authorities is providing an effective maritime surveillance and response capability," Senator Ellison said.

 "Although Customs is successfully intercepting these vessels, it is concerning that people trying to enter Australia illegally are risking their lives and the lives of their children in making these often hazardous ocean crossings."

 Arrangements are being made for the Customs chartered ferry Samson Explorer to transport the remaining suspected illegal entrants to the mainland where they will be handed over to Immigration officials.

 Although seaworthy, the vessel will be destroyed at sea to reduce the risk of unwanted disease being brought into Australia.

 Senator Ellison said that the Howard Government had stepped up efforts to detect and deter illegal immigrants attempting to come to Australia, and to prosecute people smugglers.

 These measures include -$124 million investment in the Prime Minister’s Costal Surveillance Task Force to improve Coastwatch, Customs and Navy capabilities to detect and intercept illegal arrivals, âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 prosecution of people smugglers with penalties of up to 20 years and fines of up to $220,000, as well as seizure and destruction of their boats, âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 a new overseas information campaign Pay a people smuggler and you’ll pay the price , as well as targeted visits by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to Asia, the Middle East and Europe to promote international cooperation on dealing with people smuggling, and

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 $12 million to expand the network of immigration compliance officers throughout Asia and the Middle East. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 "The Howard Government believes it is important to send a clear message that it does not tolerate people smuggling, and that queue jumpers are not welcome in Australia," Senator Ellison said.

 To date this year 8 vessels carrying 837 people have been intercepted attempting to enter Australia illegally. This compares 14 vessels and 886 people with for the same period last year.
