   Media Release H86/2003 - 16 July 2003

 

 New Contracts for Migrant English Language Tuition in Tasmania

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, today announced the  awarding of a contract worth around $5.5 million that will provide English language tuition to  migrants and refugees in Tasmania over the next five years. 

 Mr Hardgrave said this was the second time the Institute of TAFE Tasmania had been  awarded the contract for the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) delivery since the  introduction of competitive tendering in 1998.

 'The contract means English language tuition will be delivered to migrants and refugees from  more than 44 countries and 42 language backgrounds,' Mr Hardgrave said.

 The TAFE also provides facilities in four main regions and, due to the close proximity of  most areas in Tasmania, it is in the unique position of having a large number of students  being able to undertake face-to-face tuition. 

 Tuition is available in a variety of environments, including classroom and community-based  settings, through distance learning and the Home Tutor Scheme, under which clients learn  English 'one-on-one' in their homes, with the help of a volunteer tutor.

 'This flexibility of delivery ensures that wherever AMEP clients are and whatever their  circumstances and learning preferences, they will be able to access tuition which is most  appropriate to their needs,' Mr Hardgrave said.

 Nationally, the Federal Government has allocated more than $500 million over the next five  years to AMEP, including $114 million in this financial year.

 Mr Hardgrave said that the new contracts with AMEP service providers in each state and  territory would help more than 100,000 new arrivals on their journey to successful settlement  in Australia.

 'The Adult Migrant English Program is a vital component of the Government's commitment to  'nation building,' community harmony and cohesion,' Mr Hardgrave said. 

 'It represents a significant investment by the Commonwealth in ensuring that new arrivals  have every opportunity to learn our national language, and so take the first and most  important step towards full participation in Australian society.'

 While in Hobart, the Minister will also conduct settlement consultations on the  implementation of the Review of Settlement Services for Migrants and Humanitarian  Entrants.

 'This review has been invaluable in providing a clearer picture of what needs to be done to  better meet the needs of newly arrived migrants and refugees,' Mr Hardgrave said.
