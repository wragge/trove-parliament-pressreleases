 TRANSCRIPT   

 TONY BURKE MP  Member for Watson  Shadow Minister for Immigration   

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA  SUNDAY 13 AUGUST 2006   

 E&OE-PROOF ONLY   

 Subject:  Migration Amendment Designated Unauthorised Arrivals Bill, Senator  Steve Fielding, Senator Barnaby Joyce.   

 

 

 Tony Burke:  I want to welcome the statements that have been made today by Senator  Steve Fielding.  He’s kept faith with the policy that he took to the election and he’s kept  faith with the principles he asserts.   

 I also want to make it clear though that Labor takes nothing for granted in the vote that is  coming up this week.  John Howard is a tricky operator and has been around a long time.   All I hope is that Australian standards of decency do prevail.  I hope that we get to a  situation where the principles that Australians expect can be held dear and can be upheld  in the Parliament rather than giving into principles and demands which have only come to 

 us from other countries.   

 Journalist:  What do you think of Barnaby Joyce’s decision that he will abstain unless an  amendment that he is proposing gets up?   

 Tony Burke:  I’ve only heard very briefly about the amendment, I’ve got some concerns  with anything that could possibly involve the identification of asylum seekers, which is  the way part of that was put to me.    

 Everybody has got to make their own way on this.  I can guarantee that every member of  the Labor Party will be voting against it.  As I have said before, I am surprised any  Member of the Coalition can vote for it.  Twelve months ago, Barnaby didn’t abstain and  no-one abstained when it came to passing legislation to make sure that children were out  of detention.  So, what he does is his own business but I am still amazed that there is any  Member of the Government who is voting in favour of legislation like this.     

 Journalist:  (inaudible)   

 Tony Burke:  It hasn’t happened yet and I am taking nothing for granted.   

 Journalist:  Do you think it is likely though, given Steve Fielding’s comments and Judith  Troeth’s predisposition for crossing the floor, do you think it is likely that this Bill is now  dead?   

 Tony Burke:  It is still before the Senate, it’s been passed in the House of  Representatives.  I am-as I have said-taking absolutely nothing for granted.  We have got  a Parliamentary debate on, unless we can get to 39 Senators, something which is  abhorrent will become law. 

 

 Journalist:  Is this is what this is about though for you Tony, human rights and seeing  justice and human rights prevail?   

 Tony Burke:  It’s about justice, it’s about human rights, it’s about Australian standards of  decency.  That’s what’s on the line and the only reason it’s on the line is because  Indonesia said that they expected Australia to change its position on these issues.   

 Journalists:  And that’s what you want to see happen?   

 Tony Burke:  That’s right.  We should defend Australian standards of decency.  Journalist:  Can you imagine any scenario in which Labor Senators would support  Barnaby Joyce’s amendment?   

 Tony Burke:  If there is an amendment that involves identifying asylum seekers there is  no way in the world we would support the amendment and this Bill no matter how you  amend it is irredeemable.  The principle behind this Bill is to dump people in other  countries, put them beyond the reach of Australian law.  There’s no amendment or  different way of doing that that would cause Labor to support it.   

 Journalist:  How do you think the two announcements today by Fielding and by Joyce  will affect how the dissident Coalition Liberals will vote?   

 Tony Burke:  It’s beyond me to psychoanalyse the mind of any Member of Coalition so I  don’t think I can contribute to that.   

 Journalist:  Do you think there is any credibility in the prospect of an amendment that  would see the Senate having oversight or some sort of review over individual asylum  seeker cases?   

 Tony Burke:  The last thing I want to do is politicise every individual asylum seeker case.   Politicising some of the most desperate people in the world is the reason we are in this  mess in the first place.   

 

 Journalist:  If it came to the legislation getting through as is or with the amendments,  which would Labor prefer?   

 Tony Burke:  Labor prefers for the legislation to be defeated.  Simple as that.  And no  matter how it’s amended we will be voting to defeat it.   

 Journalist:  What do you think of the option of Senators abstaining?  Is that fence-sitting  and should people use their vote either way?   

 Tony Burke:  I think every Member of Parliament should vote against this.  Every  Member of Parliament last year voted that children should not be held in detention and  that indefinite detention should end.  That is undeliverable if you dump people in Nauru.     

 Journalist:  Even though you say that you are not counting your chickens or that the Bill  is not necessarily dead, do you take some heart from the views that have been expressed  by Senator Joyce and Steve Fielding this weekend?   

 Tony Burke:  As I have said before, Senator Joyce’s comments I’ve only had reported to  me about third-hand.  Senator Fielding’s comments I am more up-to-date with and the  comments from Senator Fielding are forthright principles, are pretty similar to what  Labor has been saying throughout this debate.   

 Journalist:  Well has he been grandstanding then by leaving it this long to make his  decision (inaudible)?   

 Tony Burke:  To Senator Fielding’s credit he made sure that he spoke individually to  everybody who publicly had a strong opinion on this issue.  That included the Minister, it  included me, it included the representatives from Indonesia and it included some of the  Papuan asylum seekers.  He’s made sure that he’s spoken to everyone.  It’s the sort of  legislation that the more you find out about it the more likely you are to vote against it.    

 Journalist:  Have you spoken to him at all since he has announced his position?   

 Tony Burke:  No I haven’t.   

 Journalist:  Is it right that this Bill stands or falls on the vote of just one person who has a  fairly small minority in the overall Parliament of Australia?   

 Tony Burke:  It won’t rise or fall on one person’s decision.  If we don’t get to 39 we can’t  defeat it.   

 Journalist:  How much do you think your meeting with Senator Fielding influenced his  view?   

 Tony Burke:  I think he had a world view that was expressed in his policy that’s up on the  internet that demanded some standards of decency for the treatment of asylum seekers.  I  think our conversation was just the extent to which this Bill matched or didn’t match  those principles.   

 Journalist:  What would you like to now see prevail?   

 Tony Burke:  I want to see Australian standards of decency prevail.  I want to see people  treated in a way that reflects those standards.  These are some of the most desperate  people in the world, the last thing Australia should do is to simply dump them in Nauru.   

 

 

 END.
