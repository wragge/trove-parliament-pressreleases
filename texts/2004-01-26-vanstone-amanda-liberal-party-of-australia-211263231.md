 Senator Amanda Vanstone  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 

 Nine go to Bat for Australia

 VPS 022/2004

 Nine people will take out citizenship in front of an audience of some 30 000 people at the Adelaide Oval during a break in the  International one-day match between Australia and Zimbabwe today. 

 I can't think of anything more appropriate for these nine people than to take out Australian citizenship during a one-day  international cricket match: they come from the fellow cricketing nations of India, Zimbabwe, the United Kingdom, New  Zealand and South Africa.

 I am delighted to be presiding over this ceremony, which will be conducted during the change of innings. 

 As a memento of the occasion, the nine new citizens will receive a small engraved bat presented by former Australian captain  and master of ceremonies for the event, Greg Chappell.

 I invite the crowd to also celebrate their citizenship by participating in an Affirmation ceremony. Our citizenship is something  we should actively celebrate on Australia Day. 

 To the many conferees who have come as refugees and found sanctuary here, I offer a special welcome on the day Australia  celebrates its beginnings as a new nation.

 I thank all of those people taking part in ceremonies today - from Australia's largest ceremony in Brisbane to tiny ceremonies  like that taking place on Thursday Island - for their commitment to the Australian community.
