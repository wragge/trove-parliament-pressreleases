 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/807 FRIDAY 27 AUGUST 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS & SPOKESPERSON ON IMMIGRATION  REFUGEES LOSE ACCESS TO SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE WITH NEW VISA OPTIONS The Australian Democrats have criticised a Government move which will make some refugees lose access to some Centrelink payments for up to two years. Democrats' Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, says the Government's much-touted new measures to 'benefit' refugees in Australia on temporary visas will lead to many losing access to income support payments from Centrelink and in some cases to Medicare as well. "It is absolutely outrageous that refugees who have already spent over three years in Australia are still subject to the 2 year waiting period for income support payments and other assistance such as health care cards," Senator Bartlett said. "The two year waiting period is meant to be for newly arrived migrants taking up permanent visas for the first time and is not meant to apply to refugees. "In addition, refugees who apply for a different temporary visa, such as a student visa, will also lose access to Medicare! "The Democrats will look for opportunities in the Senate to amend the Social Security Act to address this grotesque injustice. "The Government's new measures are asking refugees to discard their refugee status and cloak themselves as economic migrants.  It is a further demonstration of this Governmentâ€™s deceptive attempts to create a distinction between 'deserving' and 'undeserving' refugees. "This is yet another example of the Government trumpeting new measures as positive assistance for people they have spent years punishing, whilst hiding further negatives in the fine print. "The thousands of refugees already in Australia on temporary visas have suffered enough.  They should not have to endure more uncertainty and hardship," concluded Senator Bartlett.
