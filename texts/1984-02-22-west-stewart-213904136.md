 JOINT RELEASE FROM THE MINISTER  FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC A F F A I R S , THE HON STEWART WEST, MP AND THE 

 MINISTER FOR EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL  RELATIONS, THE HON RALPH WILLIS, M P .

 BETTER PLANNING TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON SKILLED MIGRANT WORKERS

 Australia's needs for skilled workers are to be determined  through improved planning which will emphasise greater training  of Australians and a reduced reliance on skilled m i g r a n t s .

 A  new strategy to pursue this objective was announced today by  the Federal Minister for Employment and Industrial R e l a tions, Mr Ralph Willis, and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr Stewart West.

 "We want to ensure that Australians have the opportunity to take  up an increasing share of skilled jobs and that our need for 

 overseas workers can be reduced as a result," they said.

 "The current method of assessing our needs for skilled workers  is too short-sighted, and is unable to account properly for  changes over time in labour market conditions.

 "The new strategy represents a significant step towards a more  rational and effective method of determining Australia's skilled  labour needs, both from local and overseas sources."

 The main elements of the new strategy are to:

 . undertake an annual survey of skilled occupations, co­

 ordinated by the Department of Employment and Industrial  Relations and involving education and immigration authorities,  and relevant industry departments, to provide the basis for  medium-term objectives for skilled labour supply to guide 

 the education, training and immigration systems, as well  as industry's training efforts

 . on the basis of this survey, designate occupations in which

 immigration is likely to play a significant role so that the  education and training systems can respond by increasing  domestic supply of skilled labour wherever possible

 . use the recently announced Review of Commonwealth Labour Market Programs as a basis for developing new approaches  to improving the flexibility of training syst e m s , particularly  in the trades

 .  place a ceiling, to be reviewed every six months, on the

 numbers of overseas workers who can be recruited to designated  occupations, to complement domestic labour supply in meeting  expected labour market requirements.

 Although the lead times typically involved in education and  training limit the extent to which domestic labour supply can be  raised to meet unanticipated requirements, improved co-ordination  in preparing labour market assessments and increased flexibility  in the education and training systems will enable a better  matching of the t w o .

 The new strategy will also achieve improved control over the  skilled migrant i n t a k e .

 The existing system for determining intakes of skilled migrant  workers relies on assessments of short-term demand across the  major skilled occupations, carried out every six m o n t h s .

 "By the time migrant workers are selected on the basis of this 

 information and actually arrive in Australia, labour market  conditions may have changed substantially," the Ministers s a i d .

 "Under the new arrangements, the assessment of skilled migrant  intakes will endeavour to anticipate rather than react to  changing r e quirements.

 "Assessments will be based on a medium term assessment of under­ lying demand and supply trends, with adjustment for identified  shifts in short-term labour market conditions.

 "The essence of the strategy is to change the balance between  domestic and overseas skilled labour supply for the long-term  benefit of existing workers and the community at large.

 "This will involve much more than turning the skilled immigration  tap on and off in response to short-term changes in the labour 

 m a r k e t .

 "It will involve integrating for the first time Australia's  education, labour market and immigration p olicies," the Ministers  said.

 The new procedures are currently being developed and are expected  to apply from the beginning of the next financial year.

 Mr Willis and Mr West emphasised that the strategy for skilled  migration will in no way impinge on the Government's commitment  to maintain the priority it has accorded Family and Refugee  Migration.
