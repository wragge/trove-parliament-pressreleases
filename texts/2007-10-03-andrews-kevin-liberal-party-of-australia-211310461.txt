 Kevin Andrews MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 Australia's Refugee and Humanitarian Programme, and  skilled migration 

 Wednesday, 3 October 2007 

 Doorstop: Treasury Place, Melbourne  

 E&OEâ€¦ 

 MINISTER ANDREWS: 

 Ladies and gentlemen, I'll just say a few words at the outset. There's been  some remarks this morning made that the composition of the Humanitarian  and Refugee programme is racist. That's absolute nonsense. We set the  programme according to a different range of criteria and we set it on an  annual basis. And what we've taken into account is the needs from many  places around the world from which there are refugees. It's estimated that  there are some 20 million refugees in the world. Australia is a very generous  country. In absolute numbers we take the second largest number of refugee  and humanitarian entrants of any country in the world, second only to the  United States. And on a per capita basis we actually have the most generous  Refugee and Humanitarian programme in the world and we've maintained  those numbers this year. We looked at the composition in terms of other  areas in which there are needs in addition to Africa. We've taken the largest  numbers from Africa over the last few years. But there is a need, there is  some 3-4 million people that have been displaced from Iraq in neighbouring  countries such as Jordan and Syria. And we all know from the reports in the  media, over the last few days in particular, of the very grave situation in  Burma. And there are many people that fled that country to neighbouring  countries, in particular Thailand, who were also claiming refugee status and  many of which would like to come to countries like Australia. So we've  balanced up all of those factors. 

 In addition to that, we do have a responsibility to the Australian community to  ensure that when people come to Australia they're able to adequately settle in  this country. And we have detected that there have been additional  challenges in relation to some of the people that have come from Africa over  the last few years. We had an inter-departmental committee look at this and  as a result of that I took to the Government earlier this year a package of  further messages which were funded and announced in this year's Budget of  over $200 million, over four years, specifically aimed at improving and  expanding the resettlement services, and in particular for the group of 

 refugees that have come in the last few years from Africa. Now when we've  got challenges which we've met through, and are meeting through additional  funding, but we've got those challenges, it makes sense to also monitor how  those changes are occurring and are taking effect and to ensure that we do  the best for the refugees that we've taken in Australia. And make sure that  they're able to integrate into the Australian society and be part of what has  been a great achievement by world terms and that is to take so many people  from so many different cultures, yet at the same time to integrate them into  one socially cohesive society in Australia. And that's what this year's  composition of the programme represents and reflects. 

 QUESTION: 

 In what way are these people from Africa not settling? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:  

 Well let's look at the background to them, and can I say this notion that  somehow we're seeking to demonise people from particular countries is, is  just wrong (inaudible). What we're trying to do is actually help. It's a false  compassion to say we just keep on bringing more and more people when we  know we've got challenges, it's a much more compassionate and chargeable  thing to actually make the best of it in terms of our programmes for the people  who are here, to slow it down if necessary and then reassess it after we've  monitored how these changes are going. But, let's look at the group in  particular. We know that there is a large number of people who are young,  that is in their teens and in their early 20's, often young men. We know that  they have on average, low levels of education and lower levels of education  than almost any other group of refugees that have come to Australia. And by  low levels I mean, we're talking about grade 2 and grade 3 primary school  levels by way of education. We know that many of them, indeed if not most of  them, have spent up to a decade in refugee camps and they've spent much of  their lives in very much a war torn conflicted situation. And then on top of that  they have the challenges of resettling in a culture which is vastly different to  the one which they came from. Modern Australia, modern urban Australia  largely, is vastly different from the conditions that people have come from in  many of the countries, particularly in the Horn of Africa. And that's played out  in terms of young people who've got a low level of education, who therefore  find it more difficult to get jobs, and come from a different culture from what  we're used to in Australia. 

 QUESTION: 

 (Inaudible) 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:  

 Well I'm concerned that we don't create problems down the track for this  group of people and for Australian society generally and that's why we've  taken a two-pronged approach to it. On one hand putting a lot of additional 

 resources over the next few years into further, better enhanced settlement  services, but at the same time saying let's just slow down the programme at  the moment. We, we set this programme from year to year, so at the moment  we've set the programme at 30 per cent for this year. Of course this is  reviewed again in another 10-11 months time for the next financial year. 

 QUESTION: 

 Minister, I'm an African and I've been here for 18 years, I did my first degree  here, my Masters, recently my PhD. Do I look integrated enough? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:  

 Well I hope everybody that comes to Australia is able to integrate, and  obviously after a period of 18 years one would expect and one would hope  that people are integrated into Australia. But we're looking at an overall  situation, as I said, we've had a lot of time looking at these issues over a few  months in the lead up, particularly, to the setting of this year's Budget, and I  was able to go to the Treasurer and to the Cabinet and to get an extra, more  than $200 million to enhance these settlement services. Now that's the  reflection that we recognise that there are some additional challenges. What  we need to do is to make sure that we're providing the services for the people  who are here. If you look at Africa, for example, over the last, I think it is five  years, we've taken I think more than 40,000 people from Africa, if not more  than that, over that period of time. Now, obviously there is for any group of  people a timeframe and a period of resettlement, but where we've detected  there are additional challenges then it's very important that we take the time  and put the resources in to ensure that people who have come here are able  to actually settle as we would want them. We want them to achieve their  aspirations in Australia. 

 QUESTION: 

 In what way have African refugees had more trouble settling in than refugees  from other generations in the past? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:  

 Well each generation comes from different backgrounds. When you talk about  refugees, for a long time the major source of refugees to Australia, if you go  back to the beginnings of this programme after the end of the Second World  War, many of the people who came to Australia as refugees came as  refugees from Europe, who came from largely the same Western liberal  democratic culture as we share in Australia. They may have spoken different  languages, eaten different foods, etcetera, but largely there was a sharing of  culture in terms of the people who came to Australia. More recently we've had  people from parts of Asia, for example, in which there has been some  similarities, again, in terms of the culture. Now this is not to denigrate or to  suggest that there is something wrong with particular cultures, it's just being  realistic enough to say that if we've got some challenges then we ought to be 

 clear-headed enough and we ought to be sensible enough to say let's look at  those challenges and let's work in a way with the people concerned to ensure  that we can meet their aspirations, meet the aspirations of Australians in  general. 

 QUESTION: 

 Minster, business is seeking an extra 40,000 skilled immigrants in the next  yearly intake to help to start meeting the expected labour shortfall over the  next five years. Is that something the Government will be including in its plan  if it's returned? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:  

 Well we looked at the business desires this year when we set the programme  and, and can I remind you that we've increased the size of the immigration  programme again this year. Overall we will take about 165,000 people as  permanent migrants to Australia this year. That includes about 102,000 under  the skilled stream, and that was an increase of 5,000 as a result of not only  the calls from business but also our assessment of the national interest and  what the optimal number of people coming to Australia would be. We also  take about 50,000 people under the family reunion programme, most of those,  in fact about 85 per cent of those, are spousal reunions. That is where  Australian's form a relationship, or marry a person from overseas and they  want to bring them to Australia as their spouse, whether defacto or legally  married. And we've always taken the view that as long as they meet the  general health and character concerns and it is a genuine relationship then  we shouldn't be capping the number of people who come in under the spousal  programme to Australia. That means that our family reunion programme now  brings in 50,000 each year. And then we've maintained the number of 13,000  for the Refugee and Humanitarian programme which is, as I said, is the  second largest number of any country in the world and on a per capita basis  the most generous programme of any country in the world.  

 Now we look at the national interest. We also lose from Australia, on a long  term or permanent basis, about 40-50,000 people each year. That is 40-50,000 Australians decide to go and live overseas either for a very long term  or permanently. Overall that gives us a programme of about 110,000, which  according to all the expert advice and our assessment is the optimal number  currently so far as Australia is concerned. Now, as I said, we review this  annually both in terms of the total number and in terms of the composition of  the programme and we'll do that again in the early part of next year. 

 QUESTION: 

 If the situation gets worse in Sudan will you consider revising the programme? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:  

 Well we revise it on an annual basis and, as I said, we consult with, I  consulted with refugee groups and others who have a particular interest in  this. I also, through my Department, we consulted with the United Nations  High Commission for Refugees as to where demands were around the world.  And as I said, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees convened  an international conference in Geneva in April which was specifically to look at  the plight of people who had fled from Iraq into neighbouring countries such  as Syria and Jordan. And as a result of that conference there was a request to  resettlement countries, and can I remind you there's only about 10 countries  in the world that actually have a resettlement programme like Australia. Once  you take out the US, Australia and Canada, the others only take a handful of  people in comparison to those three countries. Now we were requested as  one of those countries to look and see if we could do something in addition for  some of the people from Iraq and that's what we've done in terms of the  programme as well. 

 QUESTION: 

 Minister, shouldn't you look at business migration or skilled migration on a  longer term basis because even the current levels the expectations from  Access Economics and others is that we have a labour shortfall of 290,000 in  the next five years, flat numbers. Do you not (inaudible) on a longer term  basis that skilled immigration will be increased to meet this demand? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:  

 Well skilled immigration's very important to Australia. And there's no doubt  about that and it's part of our commitment to growing Australia. The thing  about this is that there are groups out there who are, in effect, arguing against  skilled migration to Australia. You've got the likes of the unions out there  saying we shouldn't bring temporary skilled workers to Australia. If we didn't  have temporary skilled workers in Australia then the reality is that many of our  businesses, and indeed many of our major infrastructure developments,  wouldn't be able to go ahead and that inturn would put in jeopardy the  prosperity of Australia, Australian's and the jobs of Australians. We also have  the Labor Party which seem to be saying that they're going to put emphasis  back again on family reunions rather than skilled migration. What we've said  in the national interest is that it's skilled migration which is the most important.  We've established a ratio of roughly 2:1 of skilled migrants to family reunion  and we think that's in the national interest. But, skilled migration to Australia is  important and will remain critically important to our prosperity in the future. But  it's only sensible to assess these things on a year-by-year basis. For example,  in our assessment this year we're also mindful that the Welfare to Work  changes were largely coming into operation, or largely coming into effect from  the beginning of July this year. That theoretically means that tens of  thousands of people that have been out of the workforce would come back  into the workforce and you have to balance that up against people coming in  from overseas.  

 So it makes sense whilst having a commitment to migration as part of our  prosperity, it makes sense to be able to look at the actual numbers on a year  by year basis. 

 QUESTION: 

 Minister, what evidence do you have that Africans are, aren't integrating as  well as people from other places? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:  

 Well we have evidence, and as I said, we have an inter-departmental  committee made up of very senior people from a range of Government,  Federal Government departments spending time looking at this over a period  of time, and they came to that conclusion. We have other evidence that's  provided to me. When I go out and talk to various groups I get feedback about  this all the time. We know, as I said, about their education levels and our need  to lift those education levels and to provide them with English language, and  we know in relation to things like employment statistics. So, there's a range of  evidence in relation to the matter, I don't think anybody really denies that this  is a challenge. It's really a matter of how we respond to that challenge and  putting our head in the sand and pretending it's not there is not going to help  the people concerned and it's not going to help Australia. 

 QUESTION: 

 (Inaudible) 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:  

 Well I think Australian's are supportive of the immigration programme but  they're supportive of the programme in the sense that they see it as a balance  of two things. And I think this has been Australia's great achievement. We've  balanced on the one hand diversity and on the other hand integration. That is  we've brought people from more than 200 countries around the world, from a  variety of cultures and backgrounds, with different sets of beliefs and different  outlooks and experiences, yet at the same time we have managed to and  continually integrate people into one socially cohesive nation. And I think it's  the maintenance of that balance which is important for our future and I think  that's what Australian's want. 

 QUESTION: 

 Aren't you playing the race card in the lead up to an election? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:  

 No, we're not. We are looking realistically at a challenge we've got. I mean if  we didn't have a challenge I wouldn't have got an extra $200 million from the  Treasurer in order to address some of these problems. Now that's the reality 

 of (inaudible), can I remind you this is not a new announcement, the  composition and the size of the humanitarian programme was actually  released some months ago and this was put out at that stage. Now for a  variety of reasons there seems to be a lot more interest in it now than there  was a couple of months ago. But this is not something new, it's something  which we made decisions about in the first half of this year after having  carefully looked at it for some considerable period of time. 

 QUESTION: 

 Will you release the advice on which you made this decision? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:  

 Well the advice on which we made the decision was largely material which  was provided in submissions to Cabinet and as you know Cabinet  submissions are confidential. But can I say that there, there was wide spread  examination of this, as I said, including by an inter-departmental committee  particularly in relation to the settlement issues and obviously there was a  discussion that you'd expect in Cabinet as there is, I think, each year in  relation to our immigration programme. 

 QUESTION: 

 Did you consult African refugee communities? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:  

 Well I consulted and I had a meeting of various representative groups in  Sydney as part of the consultations which my predecessors had put in place.  And there were representatives of various refugee and ethnic organisations, I  can't remember the exact number but my recollection is somewhere in the  order of about 20 representatives of various organisations. 

 QUESTION: 

 Minister, do you recognise the greatest need for refugees is in Africa, not in  the Middle East, what is your position on this? 

 MINISTER ANDREWS:  

 Well there's a need for refugees in many places around the world. I mean it's  a sad reality of the world in which we live in that there are millions of refugees.  Now, there is a need obviously in Africa, and Australia has been very  responsive to the need in Africa. We took the proportion of our refugee intake  from, I think, about 23 per cent coming from Africa, I think, six years ago up to  33 per cent. We then took it up to, as I recall, 50 per cent. Then for two years  it was 70 per cent of the total intake, it was 50 per cent last year and it's still  30 percent, that is three out of every 10 refugee and humanitarian entrants  that come to Australia this year will come from Africa. So we are responsive to 

 that but there are other areas of need around the world as well. To take  example, the people who have fled from Burma, because of a repressive  military dictatorship effectively that's running that country in Thailand, have  also got a need and we're trying to be responsive to those people as well. 

 Thank you very much.
