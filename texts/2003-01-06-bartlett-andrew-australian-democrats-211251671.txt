 Senator Andrew Bartlett  Leader of the Australian Democrats  Spokesperson for Defence 

 6 January 2003 MEDIA RELEASE          02/629              

 Leaders must hold fire  

 The human and economic cost of war in Iraq  “A war with Iraq could cause thousands more asylum seekers to approach Australia and require  millions of dollars in Australian overseas aid, before the military costs are even considered, the Leader  of the Australian Democrats, Senator Andrew Bartlett said today. 

 “The UN estimates a war with Iraq will create 900,000 refugees, and around 100,000 will need  immediate help,” Senator Bartlett said. The 1991 war caused millions of people to flee the fighting.  

  “Conditions in Iraq, after a decade of sanctions, are far worse than they were before the 1991 Gulf War  so deaths can be expected to be higher,” Senator Bartlett said.  

 Thousands of Iraqi civilians were killed during the 1991 Gulf War and an estimated 110,000 Iraqi  civilians died later due to infrastructure damage and the collapse of the health system. In Iraq, war will  result in civilian deaths not just from military attack but also from starvation, exposure and disease.  Infrastructure such as electricity, sewerage, water and food supplies is Iraq is likely to be damaged.  

 The United Nations' 'Oil for Food' programme which feeds 24 million Iraqis, is likely to be suspended  during any military action, leaving them facing starvation or reliant on inadequate emergency food aid.  A lengthy interruption in the distribution system would create a humanitarian disaster.  

 The oil-for-food program is a 1996 agreement that permits Iraq to export oil to buy humanitarian  goods, pay for weapons inspectors and pay reparations to governments and businesses for Gulf War  damage.  

 A protracted conflict would certainly interrupt distribution networks. At the worst - no new food will  enter Iraq during a conflict. The Iraqi government has boosted food rations to let citizens stock up,  claiming supplies would last 3 months. The UN and Aid agencies are hampered because they want to  avoid sending a message to Iraq that weapons inspections are futile and war is inevitable. 

 “A war with Iraq will not make the region safer, nor decrease terrorism and could result in the deaths or  displacement of more than a million Iraqis,” Senator Bartlett said. 

 “The Prime Minister John Howard should keep us out of this war and urge the United States and  British leaders to ‘hold fire’.”
