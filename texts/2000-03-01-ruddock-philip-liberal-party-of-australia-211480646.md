 Minister in Sydney for Consultations on Migration Intake MPS 024/2000

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock is in Sydney today for a series of meetings as part of his annual national consultations on the Government's migration and humanitarian programs.

 Mr Ruddock said the consultations which include a public meeting, would allow people of New South Wales the opportunity to have their say on the migrant intake for the next financial year.

 During 1998-99, 35,141 migrants arrived in NSW. Some 34.7% of those were skilled settlers, while 29.8% arrived through the family stream. The humanitarian intake was 9.5% of the total.

 "Public meetings are part of the Government's undertaking to administer Australia's immigration program in an open and accountable manner. They provide a chance to discuss Australia's population trends and the role immigration has to play," Mr Ruddock said.

 "They are an ideal forum for all Australians to contribute their ideas and comments and gives the Government community views on issues regarding refugee resettlement and other humanitarian and general migration issues.

 "During the consultations, I will meet representatives from more than 2,000 groups, including governments, business and industry groups, unions, environmental bodies, welfare organisations and representatives of Australia's migrant communities."

 Mr Ruddock said the consultations were also an opportunity for people to discuss the impact that the recent influx of illegal immigrants is having on Australia's refugee and humanitarian resettlement program.

 In addition to 10,000 offshore places, the program for 1999-2000 allocates 2,000 places for people making protection claims from within Australia (onshore).

 However, because that number is likely to be exceeded by recent illegal arrivals and other onshore applicants making refugee claims, it will reduce the number of places available to people identified off-shore by Australia and the UNHCR, as being in urgent need of resettlement. As a result, off-shore visa grants have been suspended.

 "I regard this as grossly unfair and the Government has taken steps to ensure our refugee and humanitarian program will not be dictated to us by people smugglers," Mr Ruddock said.

 The consultations started in Melbourne late last year, and include meetings in capital cities and major regional centres in all States and Territories.
