 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT DOORSTOP WITH JULIA GILLARD, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND POPULATION, MONASH UNIVERSITY GIPPSLAND CAMPUS, 5 FEBRUARY 2002

 E&OE

 SUBJECTS: Shadow Ministry, Asylum Seekers, Carmen Lawrence, Overseas                    Detention Centres, Population Policy

 CREAN:  The Shadow Ministry discussion today was a very constructive one.  We covered a range of issues, including simplification for small business, particularly in relation to their BAS forms.  We also talked, of course, about the asylum-seekers issue.  This was the first opportunity that the Shadow Cabinet as a whole has had to discuss this issue.  It’s the first opportunity we’ve also had to have a report from Julia since her recent visit to the detention centres within the Pacific.  And so today was important in terms of getting a factual basis for us working towards a constructive input to policy reform in this area.  We believe the policy reform does need to take place, and it’s the unanimous view of the Cabinet that we can have a policy which is both tough on border protection but compassionate at the same time.  There are, of course, a number of complex issues associated with this, issues that require further consideration, further assessment of the facts, and further discussion amongst the colleagues.  There are two critical things that we’ve got to do.  We’ve got to get the policy solution right, and we’ve got to involve the colleagues as much as possible within that decision-making process. Whilst we want to deal with this as a matter of priority, we won’t be rushed into it.  We need to get it right, and we will get it right. We will be having further discussions before next Monday when the Shadow Ministry will consider the issue again and the Caucus will have a full opportunity for debate on Monday.  So I’ll have something further to say following those meetings.

 JOURNALIST: Broadly, how would you expect to fulfil those two needs that you have to, the stronger border protection and more compassion?

 2

 CREAN:  I think that there are, in terms of toughness on the border, there are three fundamental elements involved.  One, we’ve got to deal with the flow of refugees at source.  And that means reaching regional agreements.  That means the Prime Minister actually getting an understanding with Indonesia to begin with. It also means getting a framework, an internationally recognised framework, and doing that through the auspices of the United Nations. Secondly, there’s got to be a cop on the beat, there’s got to be recognition that we do need a US-style Coastguard.  It isn’t just for the people-smugglers.  This is for drug-runners, this is for the pirates, this is for fishing violations, this is for quarantine, this is for a whole range of things that the nation’s borders need to be protected.  This is good policy, and the Government should be prepared to pick it up.  The third area is that if people still come from the source or get through the cop on the beat, there has to be an expeditious process for dealing with them - one that doesn’t lead to endless rights of appeal.  And one of the propositions that we’re considering is a one-stop shop appeal process.  We’ll have further to say about that down the track.  But this is a framework that can lead to a lasting solution.  It’s a framework we’ve prepared to be constructive in putting forward but, importantly, we’re prepared to give the Government bipartisan support on.  As for the issue of the people that are here, I think we have to have a proper assessment of the cost associated with the “Pacific Solution” to see whether it’s working or not.  I don’t believe it’s working; I certainly believe it’s terribly costly.  And so we’ll be using the processes of the Parliament to establish the true cost.  We know it’s blown out; the Government just won’t tell us the amount of money.  And I think that we’ve got to find a better way for dealing with people in the facilities.  And they’re the sorts of policy directions that we’ll be giving consideration to.  I think this can be done.  It will take time, it will require effort, but I think we can do it.

 JOURNALIST: Did today’s meeting discuss the divisions within the party, particularly those of Dr Lawrence?

 CREAN: Well, of course we discussed the issues going on within the Party.  It was not possible for Dr Lawrence to be with us today, but we’ll be having further discussions with her.  She’s sick and she’s not able to travel in the present circumstances.  But what we’re about is getting a solution, because if we get a solution the emphasis won’t be on the divisions.  I’m not interested in the media reporting the sides being taken in this debate.  I’m interested in the media reporting a solution - a solution that we will contribute to, a solution that’s constructive, but one that we get right.

 JOURNALIST: But isn’t your slow reaction going to lead to more division.  You say you need more time, yet the divisions seem to be widening.

 CREAN: We will resolve this issue, and what people want, what people want most of all is the opportunity to contribute to the solution.  That won’t be achieved by rushing in with a solution that people are not happy with.  We’ve got to realise the options that are available to us, we’ve got to come up with a constructive solution, we’ve got to take the colleagues with us.  I’m convinced we can do it, and I’m going to make sure that we get it right.

 JOURNALIST: The UN Human Rights Commissioner, Mary Robinson, wants to send a personal envoy to Woomera.  Should Australia subject itself to this form of international scrutiny?

 CREAN: Look, whether we like it or not, we are subjected to international scrutiny.  There is concern in all quarters, overseas and here, about the treatment.  We’ve got to make sure that people make those judgements on the best-known facts.  And so anyone prepared to consider those facts before making their judgements, is encouraged to do so.  That’s what I’m urging.  Let’s not simply jump in on prejudice in this debate.  Let’s base it on the facts, let’s get it right.

 JOURNALIST: Are you suggesting on the “Pacific Solution”, when you talk about costs, that perhaps you are looking at some alternative to that altogether?

 CREAN: Well, obviously if the inquiry establishes the extent of the costs and the fact that it’s not working, of course it needs an alternative. That’s what a policy review involves.  But I think that the opportunity for that assessment, we will take over the course of the coming days.

 JOURNALIST:  What sorts of alternatives might there be?

 CREAN: Well, you’ll just have to wait and see.  I mean that’s expecting me to pre-empt the outcome when I’ve already said that I’m going to put in train a process to arrive at the decision.  But we will, we’ve made a very good start today.  We’ll be having further meetings before Parliament resumes, we’ll be having further discussions next week and we’ll be coming forward with proposals.

 JOURNALIST:  Dr Lawrence is advertised today as a speaker at a protest rally in Canberra next week.  Will you be discussing that with her?

 CREAN: Well I think that it is more important to get our direction, our policy response, embedded and that is what I will be discussing with her.

 JOURNALIST: Will you be asking your Shadow Ministers to stick to their own portfolios from here on?

 4

 CREAN: Well look, the difficulty is with this issue is that it overlaps a number of portfolios.  All I’m asking is that they consult with their colleagues before making statements.  Not that they don’t make statements, I think that we have got to encourage constructive input into this policy debate. But they also have got to show respect to their other colleagues.  If it’s an area of overlap - consult, talk, that’s normal.  It is no different in politics. That’s life and that should happen and that’s what I have encouraged to take place and I hope that it does.

 JOURNALIST: What did you learn from Ms Gillard’s report about her trip?

 CREAN: It was a very informative report about the circumstances etc but perhaps that is a question you should direct to her if you’re interested in finding out about what she saw.

 JOURNALIST: Are you happy with what you saw?

 GILLARD: I wouldn’t say happy is the word.  It was generous of Minister Ruddock to offer to take me on this trip and I have learnt a lot from it.  I was able to view the processing facilities at Manus Island and on Nauru. I was able to see the conditions there and accompany Minister Ruddock to meetings with detainees and their representatives.  Clearly the conditions there are difficult ones.  It depends by whose standards you are judging. By the international standards of refugee camps they are not the worst conditions by a long stretch.  By Australian standards obviously though they are very difficult conditions.  The detainees raised with us a number of concerns, mostly they weren’t on conditions questions but they were about when they can expect an outcome to process them.   So they are very anxious for news.

 JOURNALIST: What about these report of malaria outbreaks on Manus Island?

 GILLARD: I spoke to the health professionals at Manus Island and I spoke to, or heard representatives of detainees speak to Minister Ruddock. They did not raise malaria as an issue.  As I understand it at the outset of the establishment of that facility there were some malaria cases but it was open to question whether the malaria had been contracted on sight or prior to arrival.  The medical professionals I talked to there indicated there had been some health issues. Dehydration initially was a health problem because people weren’t used to hydrating themselves in such a hot and humid climate and there had been individual cases of ill health but none of those were malaria cases.  Certainly when we spoke to the asylum seekers they did not raise malaria as an issue.  All of that would lead me to believe that malaria is not an ongoing problem at Manus Island and I was a bit surprised by the reports this morning.

 JOURNALIST: How did the conditions there compare to the conditions in Australian detention centres?

 GILLARD: I haven’t as yet viewed all of the Australian detention centres.  I am able to tell you about the conditions both on Manus Island and on Nauru.  People are housed in a mixture of converted shipping containers which are air conditioned.  Some are in Nissan huts, some are in specially constructed long houses.  Obviously that is not salubrious accommodation by any stretch of the imagination.  An additional problem on Nauru is obviously that the air conditioning is intermittent because the power supplies aren’t always on tap.  People eat in dining areas that have been constructed.  The food, we talked to the caterers, I think the food is adequate. They do the best they can to meet individual and cultural dietary requirements.  Having said that I am sure we are all aware that institutional catering has its limits and particularly has its limits in circumstances where sources of supply can be difficult.   There are medical personnel available to asylum seekers in all of the facilities, GPs and nurses.  For more serious matters then medical services need to be accessed differently.  They are not necessarily available on site. My all up conclusion was people are safe, people are housed, people are fed but they are difficult conditions.

 JOURNALSIT: Is there any schooling for the children?

 GILLARD: There are school rooms constructed in, or a schoolroom constructed at the topside facility in Nauru.  There is some schooling available in the Manus Island facility at PNG but it is in the order of around an hour a day for children on average.  They are also trying to assist adults with English language programs but the schooling arrangements are in my view by no means adequate.  Labor has, of course, indicated that it’s our general view that children shouldn’t be in detention and one of the reasons for that is the very great difficulties that there are providing full schooling opportunities for children in those circumstances.

 JOURNALIST: How would you characterise morale of the people who are there at the moment?

 GILLARD: The asylum seekers when we spoke to them were courteous. There were no security issues at all.  We met with representatives of the asylum seekers on Manus Island.  We met with a very big number of representatives in one facility in Nauru. In the other facility there was a mass meeting of more than 100 asylum seekers which Minister Ruddock addressed. They were cordial, they were polite, but they are clearly very anxious about what is going to happen to them next and very anxious to get their processing outcomes.  I think that it just makes ordinary commonsense, doesn’t it, that if you were in such circumstances what you would be focusing on is when are things going to change and that is what they want to know.

 JOURNALIST:  Do you think the Labor Party has been too slow to show compassion to the detainees in Australia and in the Pacific?

 GILLARD:  Absolutely not.  Labor has, since the election, well, before the election we were concerned about conditions in detention centres, we were at that stage calling for a judicial review.  Labor members have been very fulsome contributors to parliamentary committees which have reviewed detention centres.  Since the election, I’ve got as expeditiously as I could on to seeing the Pacific Island detention centres.  I will now review the rest of them.  We have had a historic concern about conditions in detention centres and we will continue to pursue that concern by observing conditions and raising conditions matters as they arise.

 JOURNALIST:  If there’s going to be a compassion approach, shouldn’t that therefore equate to doing away with mandatory detention of detainees.

 GILLARD:  Every system that I have looked at in terms of reading about systems overseas and considering the issues here, indicates that there needs to be some form of mandatory detention.  It is essential for identity checking, for security checking and for health checking.  That’s why we have mandatory detention, and it will remain our view that mandatory detention is required for such purposes.  Obviously, there is an issue about how long people are in detention, and what conditions detention centres have.  Those sorts of things will be the subject of the review that Simon has been discussing.

 CREAN:  Just on that point, I think important to understand that at today’s discussion, no one was arguing for the end to mandatory detention.

 JOURNALIST:  Is this review going to be in the context of a population policy?

 CREAN:  Our population policy argument is quite separate.  We’ve said that we need to develop a population policy.  We feel very strongly about that.  That also, of course, is Julia’s area of responsibility.  The initiative that the Victorian Government has taken in relation to opening up the discussion on this and trying to create a framework in which it can be advanced is welcomed.  And we will be developing our policy in that direction over the time.
