 CHINESE STUDENTS:  "A CLAYTON 'S DECISION" 27 June, 1990

 It is well known the Government has lost control of immigration  policy through lax administration of student entry. One 

 prominent area of difficulty was the People's Republic of China.  Poor administration was a result of a Government's blindspot in  its anxiety to raise revenue from the sale of education abroad.

 The Prime Minister has allowed his concern at the events in China  to cloud his judgement on the sensible way to address the long  term policy relating to the determination of refugee and special  humanitarian claims of PRC Nationals.

 It is because claims and circumstances vary and there are many  cases where no PRC National or Student, pre or post Tiananmen  Square should be forced to return that case-by-case examination  was always the only sensible available option.

 Provision of proper resources to enable this to occur was all  that was required along with an extension of time for processing  under existing entry arrangements.

 To get the Prime Minister "off the hook", Cabinet has now 

 endorsed the Clayton's permanent residency. .

 \ 

 This is a four year temporary residence permit with no right to  permanency.

 It is hard to see what the Prime Minister's guarantee of "no  forced return" means. Is it to be entrenched in law and bind  successive Governments?

 If there is no requirement to leave Australia, can the 

 arrangement be described legitimately as temporary?

 Further, what checks are there that those~with quasi-permanent  residency have met health and character checks as well as 

 security assessments? The only bar to permanency mentioned is  a breach of Australian Law.  . . . 1 2

 In relation to those who decide to seek Permanent Residency after  4 years, their eligiblity will depend on places being available  in the program.  But what will be the selection criteria? Will  it be competitive selection or again a special category 

 unavailable to other humanitarian claimants?

 Finally, what of those now eligible for a grant of Residence  Status? The Prime Minister suggests those who press such claims  will be punished by delay if they do not enter the special 

 category gate.

 Is the same inducement intended for a spouse or employment GORS  cases. In other words, will they be told they have no 

 sponsorship rights available to PRC Nationals in the special  category while they wait in an extended queue.

 To deny students the right to press immediate claims for 

 permanent residency on the same basis available to all other non­ residents , is also harsh and unconscionable.

 MIGRATION PROGRAM 1990/91

 The Walsh scenario seems again to be at w ork.  The Prime Minister  said at election time that a program outcome of 140,000 was  "about right" and would be continued. Then, over time, he came  to a view that 20,000 Chinese Students should eventually achieve  permanent residence.

 Now following the "blow out" thesis the 1990/91 target 

 conveniently can be reduced by about the same margin. It is not  surprising that this year's program outcome was not reached.   Already because of our poor economic performance many migrants  have re-assessed their long term commitment to Australia.  Some, 

 particularly from Europe have considered returning to their  former homelands as a result of political changes now under w a y .

 Family reunion is particularly influenced by Australia's falling  standard of living. Refugee numbers from Eastern Europe will not  be as significant. It is unfortunate that in distributing new  targets that skilled migration has been reduced while the present 

 level of interest has almost been maintained in the 1989/90  results.

 The ad hoc nature of the decision to reduce at this time migrant  numbers can be best appreciated when it is recognised that no  new information on the economic employment or environmental 

 consequences of immigration have been released.

 These changes have occurred while the B u r e a u  of Immigration  Research is still preparing papers for its National Outlook  Conference to be held in November of this year.

 KEFUGEE DETERMINATION

 it is clear that the legal definition of "who is a refugee", and  the administrative procedures for determining who satisfies this  test is under considerable stress. The Opposition recognises the  need to maintain proper control of refugee entry , consistent  with our long term humanitarian commitment to assist those who 

 have a genuine and well founded fear of persecution.

 However, our compassion cannot be so blind to the possibility of  fraud that we lose control of refugee and immigration programs.   The Opposition is willing to examine in a sensible way the 

 Government's legislative proposals when they are made available.
