 The Hon Julie Bishop MP 

 Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs 

 Deputy Leader of the Opposition 

 

 Coalition holds talks with Nauru on  offshore processing   27/07/10  

 The Coalition has welcomed the opportunity to have preliminary and informal  discussions today with the Foreign Minister for Nauru, Dr Kieren Keke in Brisbane to  discuss the potential for reopening the Australian offshore processing centre on  Nauru.  

 The meeting follows initial contact with the President of Nauru, who encouraged  further discussion and was pleased for the Foreign Minister to meet with the Coalition  today.  

 There is a clear willingness on the part of the caretaker Government in Nauru to hold  formal discussions with the Australian Government and the Coalition will take up the  opportunity immediately if elected on August 21.  

 Dr Keke confirmed today that the current President of Nauru has the power to  conclude an agreement with Australia under their Constitution with the Government  operating in caretaker mode. If Julia Gillard had bothered to talk to Nauru she would  understand this.  

 In addition, unlike in East Timor, Nauru has the relevant legislation in place to enable  the operation of a refugee processing centre.   Dr Keke indicated at the meeting he would be pleased for the Coalition to visit Nauru  in the weeks ahead to inspect the facilities and hold further informal discussions.  

 The Coalition can also confirm there is strong support for reopening the processing  centre from the Opposition party in Nauru.   In recognition of the political situation in Nauru the Coalition met yesterday with  Opposition Leader and former President Hon Ludwig Scotty, who indicated they  would welcome the reopening of the centre.  

 While the Coalition does not consider that being a signatory to the Refugee  Convention is a precondition for hosting the processing centre, both the Government  and Opposition have indicated their willingness to consider the matter.  

 Julia Gillard has run out of excuses to not pick up the phone and talk to the  Government of Nauru if she is serious about establishing an offshore processing  centre in a third country.  

 The truth is Julia Gillard and Labor are only interested in never never solutions on  offshore processing and illegal boat arrivals that get them past the election.  

 Labor have no genuine commitment to take real action on addressing the  unprecedented arrival of illegal boats to Australia.   Only the Coalition has the demonstrated resolve, commitment and policy to address  the unprecedented rate of illegal boat arrivals that have occurred as a result of Labor's  failed policy.
