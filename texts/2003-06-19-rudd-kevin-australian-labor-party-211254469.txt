 MEDIA RELEASE 

  TRANSCRIPT 0F DOORSTOP CANBERRA, THURSDAY 19 JUNE 2003  E & OE - PROOF ONLY  Subjects: Iraqi WMD Inquiry; Bali bombings; Burma   Rudd:  Reports today that the Prime Minister and the Government is seeking advice about whether or not it needs to cooperate with the Joint Intelligence Committee investigation on pre-war intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction is profoundly disturbing. It seems that what Mr Howard is saying loud and clear to the Australian intelligence community is that he is not all that keen on them cooperating with the Joint Intelligence Committee of the Parliament.   The Joint Intelligence Committee of the Parliament was established under law in Australia to provide oversight to our intelligence agencies. Why is it that Mr Howard now sees it as being appropriate to take advice on whether or not, for example, the Office of National Assessments should cooperate with the Joint Intelligence Committee? There is a very basic test alive in all of this - and that is, if Mr Downer and Mr Howard had nothing to hide, then why don’t they submit themselves to this open inquiry by the Joint Intelligence Committee?  Reporter: Do you fear it will be another, say, children overboard?  Rudd:  Well the Government has a bad track record in terms of the abuse of intelligence information for political purposes. The Government abused intelligence information during the last election campaign in their efforts to paint a picture that asylum seekers had thrown their children overboard. We subsequently found out that was simply untrue.   This Government has form on this question. That is why they have a double responsibility to cooperate with the Joint Intelligence Committee and ensure that doubts in the Australian community are put to rest about how cleanly they translated the intelligence information they had on Iraqi WMD into the public debate.  Reporter:  [Inaudible]  

 Rudd:  Mr Howard is beginning to show contempt for the parliamentary process. 

 After all, it is a law of this Parliament which establishes the Joint Intelligence Committee  to provide oversight for our intelligence community and our intelligence agencies. Again  I ask the question, what is Mr Howard, Man of Steel, Honest John, got to hide on this  question? I don’t really understand.    

 In February Mr Howard said to the Australian Parliament that he had concerns about  Iraq’s nuclear weapons program because Iraq had sought to import uranium from the  African state of Niger. Yesterday Foreign Minister Downer writes in the Sydney Morning  Herald that, in fact, that intelligence on Iraq’s attempt to import uranium from the African  state of Niger was erroneous. So yesterday we have Foreign Minister Downer saying  clearly in black and white that what John Howard told the Parliament of Australia only  three months ago was a complete furphy. Well, Mr Howard is beginning to have some  questions to answer of his own - quite apart from Mr Downer’s problem on the question  of Bali.   

 Reporter: So this inquiry is far too secretive and we may not know any of the  outcomes?   

 Rudd:  Well the pattern of this Government’s behaviour is always to be dragged  kicking and screaming into proper parliamentary scrutiny of their behaviour. Now Mr  Howard has sent out two very loud signals to the intelligence agencies about his  disinterest in cooperating with this particular parliamentary inquiry. Yesterday he  described the Joint Intelligence Committee proposed investigation on pre-war WMD  intelligence as political opportunism. And today the report is that Mr Howard is seeking  legal advice or the Government is seeking legal advice as to whether the Joint Intelligence  Committee has appropriate terms of reference to in fact prosecute this investigation.   

 Reporter: On Bali, if you tell people not to travel to everywhere where you have some  piece of intelligence, no one would travel anywhere, would they?   

 Rudd:  No one is pretending that Mr Downer could have prevented Bali. But what  we are saying is that Mr Downer had a responsibility to put the information he had on  Bali out into the public domain; people could have then made up their own minds.    

 Let’s just recount the record on that very quickly. Mr Downer had two specific pieces of  intelligence on Bali in his possession, one dated September 27 2002 which was in written  form and the second dated June 2002 which in oral form. Both of them said that Bali was  a terrorist target, specifically in the case of the June intelligence briefing, that it was a  terrorist target for Jemaah Islamiah.    

 Now the Australian people are simply saying “why didn’t you put that information out  into the public domain?” So far, we have a very thin response from the Foreign Minister  as to why he didn’t.   

 Reporter: Mr Downer says he gets pieces of information all the time as to possible  threats. Do you concede that it is difficult to put out advisories on every bit of that  advice?   

 Rudd:  Well let’s put all this into context. First of all we had the terrorist attacks on 

 September 11 by al Qaeda. Secondly, over the summer of 2001-2002 we had Australia go  to war against al Qaeda in Afghanistan to destroy al Qaeda. Three, we then have al  Qaeda’s cousin terrorist organisation, Jemaah Islamiah ,off and running throughout  South East Asia in the first half of last year. All of that is on the public record. We get to  June last year and Mr Downer is provided with specific intelligence information which  says that Bali is a desirable terrorist target and, furthermore, that nightclubs are high on  terrorist targeting priorities.    

 Now if this was simply a piece of isolated information, completely unattached from what  was going on in the broader terrorism environment, you can understand Mr Downer  perhaps putting it to one side. But Mr Downer received specific intelligence on Bali on  the back of this mounting terrorist threat by Jemaah Islamiah building up over the  previous six months. He should have put it out into the public domain, and he knows it.   

 Reporter: If you were Foreign Minister at the time, would you have changed the  travel advice?   

 Rudd:  If I had the information available to me that Mr Downer had available to  him, and if I had a clear understanding of the emerging general threat from Jemaah  Islamiah after Australia went to war against al Qaeda, frankly, I would have had no  alternative but to put this information into the domain. Mr Downer knows that. Why do  you think Mr Downer is hyperventilating in his press conferences in Phnom Penh at the  moment? He knows that he should have done this differently. It is time Mr Downer had  the guts to admit that he just got it wrong.   

 One final thing on Burma. Mr Downer is currently in South East Asia. Mr Downer has yet  to back away from his Government’s policy “constructive engagement” with the  Burmese military regime. The Burmese military regime has placed under protective  custody Aung San Suu Kyi and members of her political movement. Frankly, this  demonstrates once and for all that when it comes to dealing with the Burmese military  regime it is simply not possible to conduct business as usual. I’m calling upon Mr  Downer to formally abandon his policy of so-called “constructive engagement” with the  Burmese military regime. It is time Australia took some tough action. It is time Australia  engaged in implementing appropriate targeted sanctions against the Burmese regime.   

 Reporter: What sort of sanctions would they be?   

 Rudd:  When it comes to the definition of appropriate targeted sanctions there are a  type which deal with the international financial transactions of members of the regime,  their personal international travel, that also of their families, and it is possible to go  beyond that as well. That is the menu of targeted sanction options which Mr Downer  should be implementing now, as well as considering broader sanctions as well. 

 

 Ends.
