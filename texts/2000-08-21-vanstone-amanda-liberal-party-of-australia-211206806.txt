 POLICE OVERSEAS SERVICE MEDALS - EAST TIMOR Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, today presented the Police Overseas Service Medal and Clasp to members of the Australian Federal Police from Sydney, who served in East Timor.

 The ceremony was held at the AFP’s Sydney headquarters and attended by approximately 60 AFP officers, their families and guests; 28 officers will receive a medal or clasp in the ceremony.

 "From the moment the first deployment of AFP officers landed in East Timor in July 1999, their dedication, bravery and willingness to stand up to the savagery of the militia contributed substantially to the successful conduct of East Timor’s first self determination ballot," Senator Vanstone said.

 "Another meritorious chapter has been added to the AFP’s 34 year-long history of peacekeeping.

 "Along with other members of the UNAMET civilian police, AFP officers faced threats and intimidation by the local militia who were razing towns and murdering people in East Timor.  Unarmed and without any military support, the stand the AFP took, when many in the international community considered it was a lost cause, no doubt saved the lives of many defenceless people in East Timor.

 "The actions of this contingent of mostly Australian police which was led by an Australian, were a showcase of what civilian policing can achieve.

 "There have now been four detachments of some 250 Australian police deployed in East Timor. There are currently some 80 police fulfilling their role as part of the Australian Government’s ongoing commitment to the restoration of peace and democracy in East Timor, and 33 of them are Federal

 Police.

 "The presentation today of Police Overseas Service Medals to those members who have served is an important acknowledgment of the contribution of our Australian police to the people of East Timor."

 The Police Overseas Service Medal was originally created to recognise Australian police serving in Cyprus. It is a counterpart medal to the Australian Service Medal, which recognises members of the Australian Defence Force who serve on overseas campaigns.

 The medal is now awarded for peacekeeping in other operations.

 Background information on the AFP’s involvement in United Nations missions and East Timor, and more detail regarding the police overseas service medal is contained below.

 Media Background: AFP involvement in peacekeeping

 Australian police have been serving with UN missions since 25 May 1964, when 40 officers stepped onto the island of Cyprus to help keep the peace between its two conflicting peoples — the Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The responsibility passed to the Australian Federal Police on its formation in 1979 and continues today.

 The AFP’s role in Cyprus can be likened to community policing without the normal recourse of arrest and presentation of evidence in a court of law. The AFP provides 20 personnel on rotation, with continued involvement being assessed on the renewal of each six-month mandate.

 In early 1989, two AFP superintendents were seconded to work with the United Nations Border Relief Operation (UNBRO) in Aranyaprathet, in north-eastern Thailand, to assist the UN and the Thai government to improve security and protection of 300,000 displaced Cambodians located in refugee camps along the Thai-Cambodian border.

 In May 1992, 10 Australian Federal Police officers were sent to Cambodia as part of Australia's contribution to the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). In January 1993 the original contingent was relieved by a second contingent of 10.

 The contingent's role was to assist in bringing peace and democratic elections to Cambodia, a country which had been devastated by war for more than 20 years. In May 1993, one AFP officer was seconded to UNOSOM II to provide advice on the need for police monitors and, where possible, to organise the development and training of a civilian police authority in Somalia. In November 1993, a second AFP officer was appointed as the director of police services and deputy director of justice in Somalia.

 Two contingents of AFP officers served with the UN in Mozambique in 1994, aiding civil authorities in restoring law and order to an infrastructure that had broken down during civil war.

 Twenty-five AFP officers, three members of the Victoria Police and two members of the Queensland Police served in Haiti from October 1994 until

 March 1995 as part of a multinational force formed in the wake of a military coup.

 Following peace talks in Burnham, New Zealand in October 1997, four AFP members were deployed to Bougainville as part of the Truce Monitoring Group. The TMG concluded in April 1998 and was replaced with a Peace Monitoring Group to which two AFP officers were seconded on a 12-week rotational basis.

 Fifty members of the Australian Federal Police left Australia in June 1999 as part of the United Nations Assistance Mission in East Timor. UNAMET was established to oversee the conduct of the UN-sponsored ballot on the future of the province.

 The role of civilian police in UNAMET was to advise members of the Indonesian police in the course of their duties and to escort ballot boxes after the vote.

 Violence erupted in East Timor in the wake of the ballot, and UNAMET members existed in conditions of extreme hardship and personal danger until a decision was made to evacuate the mission's headquarters in Dili and posts in outlying areas.

 With the deployment of the Australian-led International Force in East Timor, civilian police returned to East Timor. They continue to serve there under the auspices of the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor, carrying out monitoring and advisory duties.

 Police Overseas Service Medal

 The Police Overseas Service Medal was established in 1991 to recognise service with the international peacekeeping organisations by officers of Australian police forces and other designated classes of people.

 The Regulations permit the Governor-General, on advice of the Minister for Justice and Customs, to declare any period of service with an international peacekeeping organisation to be prescribed service. This provision permits backdating. The Medal comes with a Clasp to denote the area of prescribed service and any subsequent award to the same person is made in the form of a further clasp appropriately inscribed.

 Awards of the Medal are made by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Chief Officer of an Australian police force.

 The Police Overseas Service Medal is a nickel silver circular medal ensigned with the Crown of Saint Edward. The obverse bears a globe of the world focused on Cyprus, where a large number of Australian police have served over a long period, surmounted by a branch of wattle, which represents Australia.

 The globe and wattle are surrounded around the rim of the medal by a chequerboard pattern representative of police forces worldwide. The reverse includes an inscription pane, the Federation Star and the words "Police Overseas Service Medal" around the rim. The riband is a chequerboard pattern of alternating black and white squares, six squares across, representing police service.
