 MEDIA RELEASE  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER 

 AA 04 030 11 May 2004 

 Australia's International  Development Cooperation:  Advancing Security, Prosperity  and Development in Our Region 

 I am pleased to announce that Australia will provide approximately  $2.133 billion as Official Development Assistance (ODA) in 2004-05,  an increase of $239 million over the 2003-04 Budget figure ($1.894  billion). This represents a real increase of 9.9 per cent and gives  Australia an ODA/GNI ratio of 0.26 per cent, placing Australia above  the 2003 donor average of 0.25 per cent.

 Instability and poor governance directly threaten the prospects for  growth, prosperity and development for many countries in our region  and has the potential to undermine Australia's security. The Australian  Government, with the help of our regional and international partners, is  devoting greater resources to tackle these challenges head-on. The  development cooperation program will work closely with other  Australian Government agencies as part of enhanced whole-of-government approaches to advancing development in our region.

 BUDGET HIGHLIGHTS

 There will be a significant increase of $102 million in ODA to Papua  New Guinea (estimated total of $436 million in 2004-05) to address  fundamental governance challenges - strengthening the rule of law,  enhancing economic and financial management and effective delivery  of essential health and education services. Much of this support will be  provided through the 5-year, $1.1 billion Enhanced Cooperation  Program, agreed between Australia and Papua New Guinea in  December 2003.

 

 Australia's ODA in 2004-05 to Pacific island countries will more than  double from the 2003-04 Budget ($176 million to an estimated $383  million), as they deal with serious economic, social and security  difficulties.

 Total ODA to Solomon Islands in 2004-05, through the Regional  Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) and the ongoing  bilateral development cooperation program, will be an estimated $202  million. Australia, working closely with the Government of Solomon  Islands and regional partners, will continue to support comprehensive  economic reform, enhancement of the legal and judicial environment,  developing a capable national police force to maintain law and order,  rebuilding of the machinery of government and provision of essential  services to the community, particularly in health.

 An extra $11 million will be provided in support of regional programs  to address good governance in the Pacific, and support opportunities  for pooling regional resources for more efficient and effective service  delivery and administration. This includes the establishment of a new  $6 million per year Pacific Governance Support Program (PGSP) to  strengthen practical links between Australian government agencies and  their counterparts in the Pacific, and support targeted training,  mentoring and placement of technical advisers.

 There will be substantial increases in ODA in 2004-05 for both  Vanuatu (up $8.2 million to an estimated $31 million) and Fiji (up $5.1  million to an estimated $25 million) to strengthen the administration of  law and justice, support improved economic and financial  management, public sector reform and delivery of basic services.

 Funding for the Peace and Security Fund, which I established last year,  will increase from $7.5 million to $10 million in 2004-05. This Fund  will continue to provide flexible and targeted assistance to directly  address needs in post-conflict societies, and will complement other  regional programs, such as the Regional Policing Initiative, to address  the threat of terrorism and other trans-national crime.

 ODA to Indonesia will increase by $9.1 million to $161 million to  support improved governance, particularly in fiscal management and  accountability and legal reform, and improving the delivery of basic  education through secular and Islamic schools.

 Funding of $146 million will be provided for international  humanitarian, emergency and refugee programs, an increase of $13.7  million on the 2003-04 Budget and a real increase of 50 per cent since  2000-01. This underscores Australia's commitment to assist the most 

 vulnerable, including those affected by disaster and conflict. Australia  will continue to provide generous humanitarian and longer-term  reconstruction support in Iraq, Afghanistan, Africa and Sri Lanka.

 Core funding to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)  will increase from $3 million to $5 million in 2004-05. Australia will  host a meeting of the ICRC Donor Support Group in June 2004, which  will provide an opportunity to highlight to the international donor  community the unique development challenges facing the Pacific.

 Direct Australian support for improved governance now comprises one  third of total Australian ODA, the highest level ever. An important  component of this is increased support for basic policing, including in  PNG, the Pacific and East Timor.

 Further to the $1 million provided to the World Health Organisation in  2004, a new 3-year initiative to stop the spread of communicable  diseases, such as avian influenza, in the Asia-Pacific region will  commence in 2004-05.

 The Government's 6-year commitment, through the development  cooperation program, to arrest the spread of HIV/AIDS in our region  will increase by $50 million to $250 million.

 Notwithstanding the significant achievements under Australia's 4-year,  $150 million development cooperation pledge, East Timor remains one  of the poorest countries in the Asia-Pacific. Australia will continue to  provide substantial ODA to East Timor (approximately $40 million in  2004-05) as it continues the difficult transition to self-reliance.

 The Government will provide a $5 million package of assistance to  support training, awareness raising, research and guidelines on water  quality in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly the growing problem of  arsenic contamination in drinking water. This will place Australia at  the forefront of international efforts in promoting water quality through  our development cooperation activities.
