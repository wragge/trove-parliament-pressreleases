 “You don’t have to throw the truth overboard to stand up for the country,” Wayne Swan, Leader of Opposition Business in the House, said today as he launched a website exposing the Howard Government’s cover up of the children overboard deception.

 “This website will provide a place where people can go, as this political circus unfolds, to get the facts about what the Government knew but didn’t tell, before and after the Federal election.”

 “Every day sees a new twist.  Every day sees a new spin from the Government. Every day the Prime Minister’s claims look thinner and thinner.

 “As each new layer of spin is tried out by the Government it will be exposed to the public on this site.

 “Mr Howard and Mr Crosby knew they had a time bomb on their hands the minute they won the election, so they set out to rewrite political history, rather than let the truth tarnish their victory.

 “They claimed their demonisation of asylum seekers was not the central issue in the campaign. This spin was designed to divert attention from emerging evidence resulting from their lies during the campaign.”

 “When this issue began before the election the Government knew they had a time bomb on their hands, but have tried to rewrite history rather than tarnish their victory.

 “Over the past few days the Labor Party has cornered the Prime Minister, his department, his advisors and his Government.  This site sets out all the information and deceptions that have protected them.

 “What this website lets people do is read the primary documents. It allows them to make their own judgements about the actions and lies of this Government.”
