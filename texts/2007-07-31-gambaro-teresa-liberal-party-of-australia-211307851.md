 Teresa Gambaro MP  Assistant Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 

 Media Centre  Burke fails his English homework 

 Tuesday, 31 July 2007 

 The opposition immigration spokesman, Tony Burke, is not only playing policy  catch-up on English language training for refugee and humanitarian entrants,  he falsely claims that nine out of 10 migrants are being failed by the  Government’s policy, Assistant Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  Teresa Gambaro said today. 

 The fact is up to 80 per cent of migrants who attended Adult Migrant English  Programme (AMEP) classes in 2005 attained English language Certificates I,  II or III across the spectrum of reading, writing, speaking and listening skills.  

 ‘Mr Burke also seems to think that English classes for refugees cease after  510 hours. If he was across his brief he would know that under the Special  Preparatory Programme, humanitarian entrants with low levels of education  may access an additional 400 hours of tuition - up to a total of 910 hours,’ Ms  Gambaro said. 

 The Government spends $285 million annually delivering a range of English  language programmes to new migrants and refugees. The 2007 Budget alone  dedicated $127.8 million over four years to provide intensive English language  tuition to refugee entrant students in schools across Australia.  

 ‘Under the Coalition’s strong economic management, many refugees are  moving out of the classroom and into the workplace faster than they ever did  under Labor. They are keeping Australian businesses running, and building  new prosperous lives for themselves,’ Ms Gambaro said. 

 ‘Labor’s mismanagement of the Australian economy and immigration portfolio,  on the other hand, resulted in new arrivals having no option but to join very  long welfare queues or the local ALP sub branch’. 

 ‘Tony Burke’s claim that only a Rudd Government can provide real integration  is laughable. When it comes to integration matters, Labor’s guiding policy  principle has always been the preservation of its own self-interest, not  Australia’s interests’. 

 ‘Considerable effort is being devoted at the moment across Government  agencies to develop practical initiatives to deliver English language training in  more flexible, vocationally focussed ways so that new arrivals can both work  and work on their English’.  

 ‘Only the Coalition Government has the relationship with business to make the  flexible delivery of on-the-job English language training practicable,’ the  Assistant Minister said.
