 Chris Bowen MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 Northern Territory celebrates Refugee Week  2012  Saturday, 16 June 2012 

 Joint media release with Chris Bowen MP - Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship and Senator Kate Lundy - Minister for Sport, Minister for  Multicultural Affairs, Minister Assisting for Industry and Innovation. 

 People in the Northern Territory will celebrate the valuable contribution of refugees to  the community during Refugee Week 2012, the Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Multicultural Affairs, Senator Kate  Lundy, said today. 

 Refugee Week is being celebrated from 17-23 June, with World Refugee Day on  Wednesday, 20 June. As part of the celebrations, there will be more than 100 events  across the nation in recognition of the plight of refugees and the new lives they have  established in Australia. 

 'Australia welcomes people from many lands and has a generous humanitarian  tradition,' Mr Bowen said. 

 'Australians can be rightly proud of the fact that Australia resettles more refugees per  capita than any other nation and provides much needed protection to people who  have suffered persecution.' 

 Senator Lundy said Australia's settlement support services are among the best in the  world, helping refugees to rebuild their lives here. 

 'Resettlement in Australia provides a chance for refugees to enjoy all the freedom  and opportunities this nation has to offer,' Senator Lundy said. 

 'Refugees in Australia have overcome hardship to live, study and work here, and  Refugee Week is a time to reflect on the contribution they have made to our  community, economy and culture.' 

 At 1pm on 23 June, thousands of people across Australia, including Darwin, will walk  in unity to celebrate the different paths people have taken to become Australian, as  part of the Walk Together initiative. Each walk will finish with a festival celebrating  cultural diversity. 

 In Darwin, the annual Refugee Week celebration will be held on 23 June at the Jingili  Water Gardens. The event will include cultural events, dancing, traditional cooking  and a citizenship ceremony for 24 people. 

 Australia's contribution to international protection and humanitarian efforts continues  this year, with 13 750 places offered under the humanitarian program in 2012-13. 

 Australia has resettled around 775 000 refugees and other people in humanitarian  need since the end of World War II.
