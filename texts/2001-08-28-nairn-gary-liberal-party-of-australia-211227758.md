 Press Release Ref: 480 Published: 28/8/2001 Title: Migrant Settlement Funding to benefit Queanbeyan

 Federal Member for Eden-Monaro, Gary Nairn, today announced that the Queanbeyan Multi-Lingual Centre has been awarded funding totalling $74,077 to assist migrants, refugees and  humanitarian entrants settle quickly and effectively into the local community.

 “This funding is part of a $18.4 million package offered under the Department of Immigration  and Multicultural Affairs’ Community Settlement Services Scheme (CSSS) over three years and  enables the Queanbeyan Multi-Lingual Centre to deliver a range of settlement services to  migrants. The funding is subject to the Queanbeyan Multi-Lingual Centre agreement and  continuing compliance with service agreements which will include clearly defined work  programs.

 “Migrants moving into regional areas are often faced with unique hurdles to overcome and  support services may be harder to access. In cities, migrants often have family networks and  friends who have migrated before them for support.

 “This grant will assist those who come to the Queanbeyan area to settle into the community,  contribute their skills, and share their unique culture for the benefit of the whole region.

 "Queanbeyan Multi-Lingual Centre will play an important role in this process, by providing their  clients with the advice and support which will equip them to enter the broader community  confidently, and to avail themselves of the opportunities and services available to all 

 Australians," concluded Mr Nairn.
