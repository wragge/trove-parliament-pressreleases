 PARLIAMENTARY L IB R A R Y   MiCAH

 ADDRESS BY

 THE HONORABLE NEAL BLEWETT  MINISTER FOR TRADE AND OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT AT THE LAUNCHING OF THE POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT PACK 

 FOR PARLIAMENTARIANS

 CANBERRA  Monday 20 May 1991

 THERE CAN BE FEW ISSU E S AS IMPORTANT TO THE WORLD COMMUNITY TODAY

 AS THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT OF POPULATION GROWTH.

 THEREFORE, I  AM PLEA SED  TO BE ABLE TO J O I N  DR S A I AND DIANNE 

 PROCTOR, OF THE FAM ILY PLANNING FEDERATION OF A U ST R A L IA , AT 

 TODAY'S LAUNCH OF THE BRIEFING K IT ON POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT 

 FOR PARLIAMENTARIANS.

 I  COMMEND THE F E D E R A T IO N 'S  B R IE F IN G  K IT  TO YOU AS A SALUTARY 

 REMINDER OF THE IM P L IC A T IO N S  OF POPULATION GROWTH FOR HUMAN 

 WELFARE AND FOR OUR GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT.

 OVER 90 PER CENT OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION GROWTH I S  OCCURRING IN 

 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHICH ARE LEAST EQUIPPED TO MEET THE NEEDS 

 OF T H E IR  PEOPLE AS WELL AS IN V EST IN  T H E IR  FU TU R E. THESE 

 COUNTRIES ARE CAUGHT IN  A VICIOUS CYCLE, WITH POPULATION GROWTH 

 ERODING THE GAINS IN  LIV IN G  STANDARDS BROUGHT ABOUT BY ECONOMIC 

 GROWTH.

 IN  TERMS OF GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT, UN LESS WE CAN SLOW AND 

 EVENTUALLY STA B ILISE POPULATION GROWTH, WE WILL END UP LIK E THE 

 RED QUEEN IN  'A L IC E  THROUGH THE LOOKING G L A S S ': CONDEMNED TO KEEP 

 RUNNING AS FAST AS WE CAN JU ST TO STAY IN  ONE PLACE.

 1

 THE FALL IN  BIRTHRATES SLOWED IN  THE LATE 1 9 8 0 s , AND T H IS YEAR'S 

 REPORT ON 'THE STATE OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION' BY THE UNITED 

 NATIONS POPULATION FUND, HAS AGAIN R EV ISED  WORLD POPULATION 

 GROWTH ESTIMATES UPWARDS. I T  PROJECTS AN INCREASE OF 1 BILLION 

 PEOPLE -  OR 50 TIMES THE CURRENT POPULATION OF AUSTRALIA -  EVERY 

 10 YEARS, WITH WORLD POPULATION EVENTUALLY LEVELLING OFF AT ABOUT 

 1 1 . 6  B ILLIO N : ABOUT DOUBLE THE CURRENT TOTAL OF 5 . 4  B IL L IO N .

 TO A PPRECIA TE WHAT THESE P R O JE C T IO N S  MEAN IN  TERMS OF HUMAN 

 WELFARE AND ENVIRONMENTAL SU STA IN A BILITY , I T  IS  USEFUL TO LOOK AT 

 SOME OF THE COSTS OF THE DOUBLING IN  WORLD POPULATION THAT HAS 

 ALREADY OCCURRED SINCE THE 1 9 5 0 S , PARTICULARLY IN  DEVELOPING 

 COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE BORNE THE BULK OF THAT INCREASE.

 2

 IN  THE 1 9 9 0 s , THROUGHOUT THE THIRD WORLD, SUBSISTENCE FARMERS EKE 

 OUT A LIVING ON MARGINAL LAND WHICH I S  DEPLETED OF NUTRIENTS, 

 STRIPPED OF TOPSOIL AND NO LONGER ABLE TO WITHSTAND DROUGHTS AND 

 HEAVY R A IN S. FULLY 35 PER CENT OF THE EARTH'S LAND SURFACE, IN 

 AREAS WHERE OVER 8 5 0  M ILLION PEOPLE L IV E , I S  ESTIMATED TO BE IN 

 VARIOUS STAGES OF D ESERTIFICA TIO N .

 'UNNATURAL D ISA ST E R S', WHERE HUMAN PRESSURES ON FORESTS, S O IL  AND 

 LAND CAUSE ECOSYSTEMS TO COLLAPSE UNDER OTHERWISE NORMAL 

 STRESSES, ARE ON THE R IS E . AT THE SAME TIM E , COMPETITION FOR LAND 

 AND NATURAL RESOURCES I S  CAUSING PEO PLE TO L IV E  IN  THESE 

 MARGINAL, DISASTER-PRONE AREAS, LEAVING THEM MORE VULNERABLE TO 

 NATURAL FORCES.

 THE TRAGEDY OF THE DEATH AND S U F F E R IN G  CAUSED BY THE RECENT 

 TYPHOON IN  BANGLADESH I S  A STARK EXAMPLE OF T H IS  PA TTERN : 

 POPULATION PRESSURE AND LAND SCARCITY HAD FORCED MANY OF THOSE 

 WHO DIED IN  THE TYPHOON TO LIV E ON 'C H A R S' -  BARS OF S IL T  AND 

 SAND IN  THE MIDDLE OF THE BENGAL DELTA PRONE TO BEING WASHED AWAY 

 BY FLOODS. .

 THERE ARE OTHER CAUSES FOR CONCERN. WATER SHORTAGES, ALREADY 

 SEVERE IN  PARTS OF IN D IA , AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST, WILL BECOME 

 CRITICAL IN  THE NEXT 5 0  YEARS. '

 3

 THERE I S  NOT NEARLY ENOUGH SHELTER FOR EVERY 10 0 NEW

 HOUSEHOLDS, ONLY 38 PERMANENT NEW DWELLINGS WERE BUILT EACH YEAR 

 IN  THE PAST FOUR YEARS.

 LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION ARE ALSO RESULTING IN  

 INCREASINGLY LARGE MASS MIGRATIONS BY D ISPL A C E D  PERSO N S: THE 

 NUMBER OF ENVIRONMENTAL REFUGEES I S  NOW ESTIMATED AT TEN MILLION 

 -  RIVALLING THAT OF OFFICIALLY RECOGNISED REFUGEES AND GROWING 

 MUCH FASTER.

 CLEARLY, POPULATION GROWTH I S  NOT THE SOLE CAUSE OF SUCH 

 PROBLEMS, JUST AS CONTROLLING POPULATION GROWTH I S  NOT A SOLUTION 

 IN IT S E L F .

 WE ALL KNOW OF THE THREATS POSED TO THE WORLD ENVIRONMENT BY 

 AFFLUENT COUNTRIES LIKE AUSTRALIA: AT PRESENT THREE QUARTERS OF 

 THE WORLD'S RESOURCE CONSUMPTION, GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND 

 TOXIC WASTES ARE BY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.

 SIMILARLY, IT  I S  LACK OF INCOME SECURITY OR ADEQUATE HEALTH AND 

 EDUCATION STANDARDS, WHICH ENCOURAGES POOR PEOPLE TO HAVE LARGE 

 FAMILIES AS A FORM OF INSURANCE.

 BUT WHILE OVERCONSUMPTION IN  THE WEST AND THE INEQUITABLE 

 ISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH ARE REAL AND IMPORTANT IS S U E S , IT  I S  WRONG 

 TO USE THEM, AS SOME HAVE DONE, TO DODGE THE POPULATION IS SU E .

 4

 P O P U L A T IO N  AND FA M ILY  PL A N N IN G  PROGRAMS ARE C R U C IA L  TO 

 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. WITHOUT THEM THERE WOULD BE OVER 4 0 0  

 MILLION MORE PEOPLE IN  THE DEVELOPING WORLD TODAY.

 THANKS TO SUCH PROGRAMS, THE T Y P IC A L  NUMBER OF CHILDREN EACH 

 FERTILE WOMAN WILL BEAR OVER HER LIFE T IM E  HAS DROPPED WORLDWIDE 

 FROM ALMOST 5 IN  1 9 6 0  TO 3 . 4  TODAY. IN  DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THE 

 DROP HAS BEEN STEEPER, FROM S IX  TO 3 . 9 .  OVER HALF THE WORLD'S 

 COUPLES OF CHILD BEARING AGE NOW USE CONTRACEPTION. .

 EVEN MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE FUTURE, HOWEVER, I S  THE UNMET NEED 

 FOR SUCH PROGRAMS. THANKS IN  PART TO THE EFFORTS MADE TO DATE, 

 COUPLES THE WORLD OVER ARE BECOMING AWARE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF 

 SMALLER, BETTER-SPACED FA M ILIES. .

 SURVEYS HAVE SHOWN CONSISTENTLY THAT TODAY'S MOTHERS WANT FEWER 

 C H ILD R EN : WOMEN IN  DEVELOPING CO U N TRIES WOULD HAVE 1 . 4  FEWER 

 CHILDREN ON AVERAGE I F  THEY COULD CHOOSE. AS MANY AS 5 0  TO 8 0  PER 

 CENT OF MARRIED WOMEN IN  DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ALREADY WANT TO 

 L IM IT  OR SPACE FUTURE BIR TH S.

 AS THE BRIEFING K IT POINTS OUT, I F  ALL THE WOMEN WHO SAY THEY 

 WANT TO L IM IT  THE S I Z E  OF T H E IR  F A M IL IE S  COULD DO S O , THE 

 POPULATION OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WOULD BE 1 . 3  BILLIO N  FEWER IN 

 35 YEARS' TIME.

 5

 THE CHALLENGE, OF COURSE, I S  HOW TO MAKE TH IS PO S SIB L E .

 I T  I S  A CHALLENGE WHICH THE ORGANISATION HEADED BY DR S A I , THE 

 INTERNATIONAL PLANNED PARENTHOOD FEDERATION ( I P P F )  AND OTHER 

 INTERNATIONAL POPULATION AND FAMILY PLANNING ORGANISATIONS, HAVE 

 BEEN ENGAGED IN  MEETING FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIM E.

 THE IP P F  WAS IN  FACT FOUNDED ON THE VERY PR IN C IPLE OF PE O P L E 'S  

 R IG H T TO FAMILY PLA NN IN G, A R IG H T F IR S T  MADE E X P L IC IT  IN  AN 

 INTERNATIONAL FORUM IN  1 9 5 3  TO RATIFY THE CONSTITUTION OF THE 

 I P P F .

 S IN C E  THAT T IM E , THE I P P F  HAS GROWN IN T O  TH E LA R G E ST  

 INTERNATIONAL NON-GOVERNMENT AGENCY PROVIDING FAM ILY PLANNING 

 SERVICES AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS, WITH AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF ABOUT $US 

 50 M ILLION. THE STRENGTH OF THE IP P F  HAS BEEN IT S  RELIANCE ON 

 COMMUNITY COOPERATION AND THE VOLUNTARY WORK OF I T S  MEMBER 

 ORGANISATIONS.

 FOR IT S  PART, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT I S  ALSO DOING WHAT IT  

 CAN TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE INTERNATIONAL EFFORT REQUIRED TO HALT 

 POPULATION GROWTH.

 6

 POPULATION PROGRAMS ARE RECEIVING SPECIA L PR IO R ITY  AS PART OF THE 

 GOVERNMENT'S INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT IN IT IA T IV E S  TH IS FINANCIAL 

 YEAR. FUNDING FOR THE POPULATION SECTOR HAS INCREASED BY OVER 

 50 PER CENT THIS YEAR, TO APPROXIMATELY $7 M ILL IO N .

 FUNDING FOR THE IP P F  INCREASED T H IS YEAR BY 9 0  PER CENT TO OVER 

 $ 0 .8  MILLION, AND AIDAB ALSO PROVIDED AN ADDITIONAL $ 1 0 0 ,0 0 0  FOR 

 A PROJECT BY THE FAM ILY PLANNING FED ERA TIO N  OF AUSTRALIA TO 

 PRODUCE VIDEOTAPES ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH WHICH WILL BE USED AS 

 TRAINING AIDS BY IT S  FAMILY PLANNING ASSOCIATION COUNTERPARTS IN 

 THE PA C IFIC  REGION. THE F P F A 'S  WORK IN  AUSTRALIA I S  ALSO ASSISTED 

 BY THE FUNDING THE ASSOCIATION RECEIVES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF 

 COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH.

 AIDAB ALSO SUPPORTED THE PREPARATION OF THE BRIEFIN G  K IT  WE ARE 

 HERE TO LAUNCH TODAY, WITH A GRANT OF $ 1 7 , 0 0 0  LAST FINANCIAL 

 YEAR.

 THE GOVERNMENT W IL L  CONTINUE TO G IV E H IG H  P R IO R IT Y  TO A ID  

 A C T IV IT IE S IN  THE POPULATION SECTOR. I T  I S  HOPED THAT INCREASED 

 FUNDING WILL BE AVAILABLE DEPENDING UPON BUDGETARY CIRCUMSTANCES.

 IN  ORDER TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR THE INCREASED ATTENTION BEING 

 GIVEN TO THE POPULATION SECTOR IN  THE AID PROGRAM, THE GOVERNMENT 

 HAS ALSO DEVELOPED A CLEARLY ARTICULATED POLICY ON SUPPORT TO 

 POPULATION A C T IV IT IE S .

 7

 IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF OUR POLICY STANCE ARE THE RECOGNITION OF THE

 RIGHT OF ALL PEOPLE TO HAVE THE INFORMATION, EDUCATION AND MEANS 

 TO DECIDE THE NUMBER AND SPACING OF TH EIR  CHILDREN, AND THE NEED 

 TO GIVE PRIORITY TO PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE STATUS OF 

 WOMEN.

 ANOTHER P R IN C IP L E  WHICH I  REGARD AS VERY IM PO RTA N T IN  

 IMPLEMENTING THESE PO L IC IE S I S  P E O P L E 'S  RIGHT TO HIGH QUALITY 

 FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMS, WHICH INFORM AND EDUCATE THEM ABOUT 

 FAMILY PLANNING OPTIONS, AND ENABLE THEM TO MAKE A FREE CHOICE 

 ABOUT METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION.

 I  HAVE ASKED AIDAB TO ENSURE THAT THESE PR IN C IPL E S OF VOLUNTARISM 

 AND QUALITY OF CARE ARE, AS FAR AS P O S S IB L E , B U ILT IN TO  ANY 

 IN IT IA T I V E S  IN  THE POPULATION F IE L D  FUNDED THROUGH THE A ID  

 PROGRAM, IN  PARTICULAR IN  THE B ILA TER A L PROGRAM WHERE WE CAN 

 E X E R C ISE A GREATER DEGREE OF P R E S C R IP T IV E N E S S  OVER PRO JECT 

 DESIGN.

 A U S T R A L IA 'S  STANCE ON THE D IF F IC U L T  Q U ESTIO N  OF COERCION IN  

 POPULATION PROGRAMS IS  ALSO CLEARLY ARTICULATED IN  THE POLICY 

 STATEMENT AND IN  SUBSEQUENT STATEMENTS BY BOTH MYSELF AND MY 

 COLLEAGUE, THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE.

 8

 THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT SUPPORT PROGRAMS WHICH 

 SANCTION THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS OR THE USE OF COERCION, 

 DEFINED BROADLY AS INCLUDING -  AS WELL AS PHYSICAL COERCION -  THE 

 USE OF ECONOMIC F IN E S  SO LARGE THAT THEY RESULT IN  GENUINE 

 HARDSHIP.

 BUT I F  COERCION IN  FAMILY PLANNING I S  ONE DANGER, DENIAL OF 

 FAMILY PLANNING I S  ANOTHER DANGER. TO DENY PEOPLE ACCESS TO 

 EFFECTIVE FAMILY PLANNING INFORMATION AND SE R V IC E S, I S  TO DENY 

 PEOPLE IN  DEVELOPING COUNTRIES A BASIC RIG H T.

 IN  TH IS CONTEXT FAMILY PLANNING IS  NOT ONLY A HUMAN RIGHT: IT  IS  

 ONE OF THE MORE HUMANE RIGHTS OF C IV IL  SO CIETY .

 I  COMMEND THE BRIEFING K IT  TO MY COLLEAGUES AND TO THE AUSTRALIAN 

 COMMUNITY.
