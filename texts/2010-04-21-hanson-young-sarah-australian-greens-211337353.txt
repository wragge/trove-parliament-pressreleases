 Govt Ignores Call For A Human Rights Act

 Media Release | Spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young

 Wednesday 21st April 2010, 5:54pm

 The Federal Government has ignored the key recommendation of the Human Rights

 Consultation Report by its refusal to consider a Human Rights Act, according to Greens

 Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.

 Senator Hanson-Young, Greens spokesperson on Human Rights, says Australians don't

 have to look very far to see the reasons why the establishment of an act or charter of rights

 would have been the appropriate choice of action.

 "It's very disappointing that the Federal Government, after setting up the Report to gauge the

 public's views, have ignored the main recommendation to set up a Human Rights Act,''

 Senator Hanson-Young said.

 "Everything that the Government has done in the last fortnight, from the suspension of

 asylum claims from Sri Lankans and Afghanis, to the re-opening of the desert prison at

 Curtin, emphasise why there should be some oversight of what authorities are doing,

 through a charter of rights.

 "Australia is the only Western democracy without a charter or bill of human rights and the

 Prime Minister has missed the perfect opportunity to bring Australia up to international

 standards.''

 The failure to enact a charter is hardly fair on groups who are being let down by the system,

 including asylum-seekers, those with mental health issues, the elderly, indigenous

 Australians and people with a disability, Senator Hanson-Young said.

 "Their rights will continue to be dealt with an ad hoc manner, without systemic protection,

 despite the Attorney-General's comments that human rights are about ‘a fair go all around',''

 the Senator said.

 The Greens will look closely at the government's proposed Human Rights Framework to

 ensure that all Australians truly get a ‘fair go'.
