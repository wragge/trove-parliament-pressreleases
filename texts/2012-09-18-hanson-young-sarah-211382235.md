 Media Release 

 Are women and children bound for Nauru?   The Salvation Army’s comments today outlining the inadequate nature of facilities on Nauru for  women and children have left the government with some serious questions to answer. 

 “Is Minister Bowen willing to send children and unaccompanied minors to Nauru where facilities  clearly aren’t appropriate?” Greens immigration spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson-Young  asked today. 

 “It’s a simple question that the government needs to answer. 

 “The Salvation Army has said the conditions are not appropriate, the UNHCR has said the  conditions are not appropriate and we know that the conditions on Nauru the last time we sent  women and children there damaged people. 

 “I was disturbed to hear reports this week of a young refugee boy resorting to self-harm in the  Christmas Island detention facility before he has even been taken to Nauru. 

 “This is the cruel reality of an inhumane and illegal policy that brings vulnerable people to a  point of self-destruction. 

 “The Greens agree with the experts when they say that deterrent policies don’t work to protect  and care for refugees. 

 “Offering safer pathways is the only way to stop people coming by boat. 

 “When will the government start bringing refugees from Indonesia for resettlement in Australia,  so they don’t have to make dangerous boat journeys? 

 “No child should be sent to indefinite detention on Nauru and the Minister must clarify what  limitations he will put on his inhumane policy.”
