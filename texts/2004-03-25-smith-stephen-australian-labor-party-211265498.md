 GOVERNMENTâ€™S INTRODUCTION TODAY OF MIGRATION JUDICIAL  REVIEW LEGISLATION   

 The Government has failed for a number of years to adequately address the timeliness of  judicial review and appeal processes for migration decisions.   

 Former Minister for Immigration and now Attorney General, Philip Ruddock was  obsessed with privative clauses and seeking to exclude judicial review.     

 This was always problematic.   

 The Government should have invested time in applying itself to appropriate court based  procedures to ensure fast and efficient outcomes.   

 One of the difficulties of judicial review in the migration area is the ongoing lack of  confidence in RRT decisions.  An improvement in the standard and perception of the first  review is therefore fundamental. 

 

 Labor will abolish the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) and replace it with a Refugee  Status Determination Tribunal (RSDT), with a legally qualified Chair, and then provide  appeals to the Federal Magistrates Court.   

 I have previously indicated that I would respond in a positive and favourable way to any  sensible suggestions from the Government for reform in this area.   

 There is no point, however, in wasting even more time on these matters which simply  seek to exclude judicial review absolutely and would see the now well trodden steps to  the High Court simply retraced. 

 

 In this area, the devil is always in the detail, which we will now closely examine in the  usual way so far as legislation of this nature is concerned.   

 The Government has indicated that the Bill is the first stage of its response to the  recommendations of the Migration Litigation Review.  I call for the public release of that  report in order to allow an informed and thorough Parliamentary and public debate on  this issue.
