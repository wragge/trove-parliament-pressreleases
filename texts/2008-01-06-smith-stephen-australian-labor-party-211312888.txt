 AUSTRALIAN HUMANITARIAN AID FOR KENYA   

 

 Australia will provide $1 million through its international aid agency, AusAID, to  organisations helping to meet the immediate needs of people affected by the terrible post-election violence in Kenya and to resolve and prevent further conflict.   

 Australian support will be directed to the International and Kenyan Red Cross, and the office  of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).     

 These organisations have the relevant expertise and teams of professional local staff in Kenya  providing vital food, medicines, shelter and protection to those affected and displaced by the  violence.    

 The International Committee of the Red Cross is working to reunite families and, through the  provision of relief services, helping bring calm to communities.   

 We will continue to closely monitor the situation, and will consider further humanitarian and  conflict prevention support should this be required.
