 SPEED DIAL FOR ENTRY TO AUSTRALIA 

 Mr Michael Keenan MP  

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs 

 Unauthorised boats arriving in Australia’s waters are doing the Government’s job for them, and calling ahead to 

 announce their arrival and to get Australian authorities to come and collect them.  

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs Michael Keenan said unauthorised arrivals have become more 

 organised, now travelling with the contact numbers of Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) and other 

 government organisations at their fingertips and ready to make the call for a pick up.  

 “Border Protection Command has become so stretched under the Rudd Government that they are now 

 intercepting vessels on the back of information being provided by the unauthorised arrivals themselves,” said Mr 

 Keenan.  

 “Our borders are now so porous the process is now similar to a transfer service - just call and the Australian 

 Government will send someone to collect you, take you to the Christmas Island visa factory and then on to 

 Australia.”  

 Mr Keenan pointed to Saturday’s arrival, which called AMSA in the hope of being picked up, as evidence that the 

 people travelling to Australia seeking asylum now know how to expose the weaknesses in Rudd’s border policy.  

 Just after 8pm on Saturday night, HMAS Larrakia, operating under the control of Border Protection Command, 

 intercepted a vessel approximately 91 nautical miles south west of Christmas Island with 45 people on board the 

 vessel.  

 “Australia’s border protection now appears to be operating on an honour system,” said Mr Keenan.  

 “What kind or message does this send to the people smugglers?”
