 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling PEOPLE SMUGGLERS IGNORE LABOR November 10, 2012

 The arrival of the 18th boat of November shows people smugglers are ignoring Labor's half measures on our borders and lack  of  resolve,  Shadow  Minister  for  Immigration  and  Citizenship,  Scott  Morrison,  and  Shadow  Minister  for  Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “With boats arriving in  record numbers including a staggering total of more than 900 people in just the first ten days of November it is clear people smugglers know Labor will not stop them,” Mr Morrison said.

 “The odds are not only firmly stacked in the people smugglers' favour, the game has been rigged and they are collecting millions of dollars more with every boat they are now sending at the rate of two a day.

 “Only an election will give the Australian people the chance to stop the cost, chaos and tragedy on our borders by voting for the Coalition to restore the full suite of Howard measures to stop the boats,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “Over 900 people have arrived by boat in the first 10 days of November - already double the amount of  people budgeted for the entire month.

 “The  Labor  Party’s  first  and  biggest  blunder  on  border  protection  was  abolishing  the  proven  policies  of  the  Howard Government - a decision that reinvigorated people smuggling and led to this flood of illegal boat arrivals.

 “If those policies weren’t changed then we wouldn’t have had huge expenses for the Australian tax payer, tragedies at sea and people smuggling syndicates flourishing in the region.

 “That  is  why,  whilst  Labor  remain  in  office,  people  smugglers  will  remain  in  charge  over  who  comes  to  Australia,”  Mr  Keenan said.
