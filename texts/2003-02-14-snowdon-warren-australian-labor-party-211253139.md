 East Timorese legal labour in vain   

 The Minister for Immigration has already decided to allow 150 East Timorese  asylum seekers to remain in Australia, but is forcing all of them to continue with  costly and lengthy legal battles.   

 The Minister told ABC radio yesterday that his department had identified “something  like a hundred and fifty of this [East Timorese] caseload” as being eligible for  permanent residency because they are married to Australian citizens.   

 “If the Minister knows who will be allowed to stay, he should grant them residency  immediately,” Warren Snowdon, the member for Lingiari, said today.   

 “It is totally inappropriate that these people are forced to endure the trauma and  cost of these legal processes when he knows how their claims will end.   

 “This shows no concern for the stress on these families, and no concern for the  financial burden on both the applicants and the Commonwealth.”   

 The Government began processing the 1,800 East Timorese protection applications  in September last year, rejecting every claim.   

 Most of the rejections are currently being appealed through the Refugee Review  Tribunal at a cost of $1,000 per application.   

 Mr Snowdon said allowing only a small number of East Timorese to stay would be a  completely inadequate outcome.   

 “The Australian Government is responsible for putting the East Timorese in the  situation where their claims are no longer current,” Mr Snowdon said.   

 “It’s now the Government’s responsibility to amend this mistake.   

 “The Minister must create a special humanitarian visa class for this community and  extend it to all of the 1,800 applicants - not just ten per cent of them.   

 “These people are part of our community, and this is where they should stay.”   

 Ends.
