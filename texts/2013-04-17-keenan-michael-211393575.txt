 25th boat arrival for April 

 17/04/13 

 The people smugglers daily double ferry service continues with the arrival of the 25th boat for April  despite only being just over two weeks into the month, Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship and Shadow Minister for Justice Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said. 

 “The latest boat arrival, carrying 51 people, which required assistance on Monday, was a timely  reminder of the dangerous risks that this journey can bring,” Mr Keenan said. 

 “It comes as Customs has released their internal assessment on the tragedy that occurred on 25th  March this year, where sadly two people lost their lives when the vessel they were on capsized. 

 “The people smugglers do not care one iota for the safety of people they smuggle down here and  this is why this insidious trade must be stopped. 

 “In order to stop people smuggling we must reintroduce tough policies, including temporary  protection visas that stop them from selling permanent residence to Australia and turning the boats  back around which sends the strongest possible message that Australia’s borders are not open for  business. 

 “The Coalition has the will and the resolve to squash the people smuggling trade,” Mr Keenan said.
