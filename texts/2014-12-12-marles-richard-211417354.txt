 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 SCOTT MORRISON NEEDS TO STOP PASSING THE BUCK   

 The death of an asylum seeker in an Australian funded facility in Papua New Guinea  earlier this year is a tragedy which must not be allowed to occur again.   

 The Abbott Government must ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to prevent a  horrific event of this kind from ever being repeated.   

 Today the Minister, Scott Morrison is blaming everyone but himself. The simple truth is  a young man lost his life on Scott Morrisonâ€™s watch.   

 Instead of focusing on everyone else's jobs - Mr Morrison should start with doing his  own properly.    

 Since becoming Minister, Scott Morrison has shrouded his portfolio area in secrecy.    

 This lack of transparency compounds concerns Labor has about the way in which he  manages his portfolio, replacing hope with hard-line rhetoric.    

 The Australian people need to be assured our detention networks are run in a safe  manner.   

 Labor believes that men, women and children seeking asylum ought to be treated in a  safe, humane and dignified manner and not allowed to languish indefinitely in detention  facilities.
