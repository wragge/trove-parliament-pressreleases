 PRIME MINISTER 

 

 OFFSHORE PROCESSING 

 

 The Australian Government has decided to make a number of changes to the Migration  Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006 (the Bill).  The Bill eliminates  the distinction between unauthorised boat arrivals at an excised offshore place and those  who reach the mainland.     

 The proposed changes do not alter the thrust of the Bill or the fundamental principles of  the Government’s offshore processing system.  The Government remains committed to  strengthening Australia’s border protection measures and believes the Bill is important to  achieving that goal.     

 The changes received strong majority support from members of the Government party  room at a meeting held earlier this evening.   

 The changes extend the essential principles adopted by the Government last year in  relation to the processing of people in immigration detention in Australia.  With these  changes, the passage of the Bill offers improved conditions for people in Offshore  Processing Centres (OPCs).   

 The proposed changes reflect the Government’s intention that women, children and  families in OPCs, following primary processing, would be housed in residential-style  accommodation in a community setting.     

 With passage of the Bill the Migration Act will be amended to make it clear that the  principle that children should only be detained “as a measure of last resort” will also  apply to offshore processing.   

 The Act will also be amended to clarify the Minister’s power to direct that the staff of the  Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) work with host  governments to seek to put in place appropriate accommodation arrangements to ensure  that families, in particular women and children, are placed in residential accommodation.   

 In Nauru the Government intends to establish residential-style accommodation for  women, children and families in a community setting.  Families would be free to come  and go consistent with their Nauruan visa requirements.

 The Government will amend the Act to provide the Minister with a non-compellable and  non-reviewable power to issue a visa to people taken to OPCs where the Minister is  satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so.  This effectively extends the Minister’s 

 current power, which was introduced as a result of last year’s changes.   

 The Government will put in place administrative mechanisms to ensure making a  decision on a person’s request for refugee status is made where possible within three  months.  Arrangements will also be put in place to ensure reviews are completed within  three months where possible.   

 To reflect the reports provided in relation to the processing of onshore Protection Visa  applications, the Act will be amended to include reporting on the achievement of this  target time for processing and review, including the instances where timeframes are not  met and the reasons why.  All reporting will be de-identified to comply with privacy and  protection requirements.   

 The Government will amend the Bill to make clear on the face of the Act that the  Ombudsman has powers to investigate the actions of DIMA officers overseas, including  in relation to refugee assessment processes in OPCs, while enhancing those powers  through the provision for mandatory tabling of statements of all reports received from the  Ombudsman.   

 The Government will also amend the Bill to specify that the Minister can refer matters to  the Ombudsman for investigation, which will include requesting that the Ombudsman  review the cases of people in the OPCs who have been resident there for more than two  years.  The Ombudsman may make any recommendations he sees fit.  No  recommendation of the Ombudsman will in any way bind the Minister. 

 

 Those amendments to the Bill will be circulated tomorrow and will be moved by the  Government during debate on the Bill in the House when the Parliament resumes for the  Spring Sitting. 

 

 The changes follow detailed discussion between Government members and the Minister  for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.  They also reflect the Government’s response  to the Senate Committee’s report on the Bill.   

 Details of the proposed changes are attached.   

 21 June 2006   

 Attachment  Proposed Government Changes to the Provisions of the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006 and the Processes to apply to Designated Unauthorised Arrivals  The Government remains committed to strengthening Austra lia’s border protection measures, consistent with Australia’s international obligations, and believes this legisl ation is important to achieving that goal. The legislation eliminates the distinction between unauthorised boat arriva ls at an excised offshore place and those who reach the mainland. The changes will apply to all unauthorised boat arriva ls regardless of their nationality. The policy reflects the Government’s strong commitment to ef fective border control while ensuring we  continue to meet our international obligations.  Some changes have been suggested to aspects of  the Bill. The Government has co nsidered these issues and where possible has sought to accommodate these concerns where this would not effect the f undamental operation of the Bill or the offshore processing system.  Consistency with the Australian refugee determination The Government proposes a number of changes to ensure greater consistency between arrangements under the Bill and processes applying in Australia. These are achieved either through amendment to the Bill or the implement ation of appropriate admini strative arrangements.  Changes   

 â¢  Time limits: The Government notes that asylum seekers in Offshore Processing Centres (OPCs) are not 

 applicants for Australian Protection Visas and that residen ce in the centres is not detention under Australian law. While it is not appropriate to address time lim its for a non-statutory process through the Bill, the Government commits to making a decision on a person’s request for refugee status within three months, where possible. To reflect the reports provided in relation to the processing of onshore Protection Visa applications, Part 8 D of the Bill will be amended to include reporting on the achievement of this target time for processing, including the instances where timeframes are not met and the reasons why. All reporting will be de-identified to comply with privacy and protection requirements. This will make arrangements for processing consistent with those that now apply in Australia following changes made last year.  

 â¢  Resettlement in Australia:  The Government stands by its position t hat it will continue to comply with its 

 obligations under the UN Refugees Convention. Individuals who wish to make a claim for asylum will be able to 

 

 do so, their claims will be properly considered, and if thei r claim is upheld and protection is required, protection will be offered at an appropriate place. The first pref erence of the Government is that people found to be refugees will remain offshore until re settlement to a third country is arr anged, as has occurred in the past. However, consideration for resettlement in Australia wi ll continue to be given to those for whom resettlement opportunities in other countries are not available or appro priate (for example, people who have particular family links to Australia). The Government will maintain it s commitment to ensuring that refugees are resettled as soon as possible while continuing to take into account  considerations such as security assessments and any other relevant factors. Under the arra ngements already in place with Nauru, Australia is effectively the place of last resort for resettlement, as the Government has under taken to ensure that no as ylum seeker will be left on Nauru indefinitely.  

 The Government understands that persons assessed to be gen uine refugees should not be left indefinitely in an OPC. The Government is not prepared to set limits on the time allo wed for resettlement as this may have the effect of entitling a person to enter Australia and unjustifiably undermine our territorial sovereignty and would encourage people not to cooperate with efforts to process and resettle them. However, the Government recognises that there is a point at which other options have been reasonably exhausted. In such circ umstances the Government would exercise its discretion, as it has in the past, to bring genuine refugees to Australia. T he Government will continue to apply this policy consistent with security assessments and any  other relevant factors.  

 â¢  Children in detention:  Accommodation at an OPC is not detentio n under Australian law. The Government 

 remains committed to the principle in the Migration Act 1958 that children should only be detained “as a measure of last resort”. The Governme nt will amend the Bill to reflect that it  will work with host countries to seek to uphold the principle where possible in relation to children taken to OPCs. It should be noted that host countries are sovereign nations and none of these arrangements would prevent hos t countries from making restrictions on movement of individuals. For example,  an initial period of restriction for health checking and other processing may be required. However, this is co nsistent with the process which applies to those processed in Australia.  

 â¢  Independent legal advice:  The Government provides publicly fun ded migration agent assistance to Protection 

 Visa applicants in detention in Australia through a panel of private sector and ‘not for profit’ service providers. These arrangements will be expanded to include provision of similar levels of publicly funded support for people being processed in OPCs. This would typically in volve deployment of teams of migration agents to prepare statements in support of refugee claims and t hen sit in on the refugee interviews conducted by the decision-maker. This arrangement would include fund ing for face-to-face contact between the adviser and client, such as through the initial and any review interv iews, and also for other contact via telephone, fax or the 

 internet. The Government will meet the reasonable costs associated with the extension of this migration agent assistance to designated unauthorised arrivals.  

 â¢  Discretionary power to issue a visa:  The Government will amend the Bill to provide the Minister with a non-compellable and non-reviewable power to issue a visa to people taken to OPCs where the Minister is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so, equivalent to the Minister’s discretion in respect of onshore applicants. As applies in relation to onshore applic ants, the Minister will have considerable flexibility to grant a visa that is appropriate to that individual’s circumstances, incl uding a Removal Pending Bridging Visa. When deciding whether or not to exercise this discretion, the Minister will take into account health and security issues. This will extend the Minister’s power, which was introduced as part of changes made last year, to cover offshore processing.   â¢  Merits review:  The Government will establish a pool of non-DI MA decision makers for the independent review 

 of failed requests for refugee status . These review decision makers will primarily be drawn from those with experience on the Refugee Review Tribunal (either cu rrent members in an off-line capacity or former members). Arrangements to assign cases to individual  members of the pool would be independent from DIMA, using random assignments of cases on the basis of avail ability to conduct reviews within the review timeframe. The Government commits to reviews being completed wi thin three months, where possible and will amend the Bill to provide that reports on the arrangements for re view of offshore refugee assessments, including details and qualifications of those appointed to the pool of review  decision-makers and achievement of the target time for completing reviews, will be included in the current r eporting requirements proposed in Part 8D of the Bill.  

 Review decision makers would report to the Minister for I mmigration and Multicultural Affa irs on the outcome of their assessments. To date reasons for decisions in the offs hore processing centres have been provided orally. Under proposed new arrangements, reasons for decisions at primary and review stages would be provided in writing to the asylum seekers concerned.  

 â¢  Special measures for families and children:  The special health, welfare and educational needs of children 

 remain foremost in the Government’s and IOM’s considerations. The Government has reviewed the arrangements for the accommodation of women, children an d families and the Government intends to establish appropriate residential-style acco mmodation for these groups.  

 People in OPCs are not detained under Australian law. As a result, the Minister has no power to make a residence determination in respect of a person in an OPC and such a po wer cannot be created in Australian legislation. However, 

 in Nauru, suitable accommodation is being sought in consul tation with the Nauruan Government which will provide residential-style accommodation for women, children and fam ilies in a community setting. A suitable site has been identified with suitable housing struct ures which could be upgraded to an appropriate standard for use by families.  Security around such a village-style complex would be non-i ntrusive and designed to ensure the safety and protection of the women, children and families living there. It would be fenced, but  residents would be able to enter and exit during the day on their own recognisance. The Nauruan Government w ill at least initially place a visa requirement on residents to be back in the village at night for their safety. It may be possible to have this requirement revisited after the village has been open for an initial period. There would be no “locked gate” security, but night time  access would be monitored and controlled by IOM-engaged private security personnel for safety re asons. Families would be able to secure  their own premises and security staff would only be able to enter accommodation facilities at the r equest of or with the agreement of residents. Families would be free to come and go consistent with their Nauruan visa requirements. The Government intends that women, children and fa milies in OPCs would be housed in residential-style accommodation in a community setting, following primary processing.  The Bill will be amended to clarify the Minist er’s power to direct that DIMA staff work with the host governments to seek to put in place appropriate accommodation arrangements in i ndividual cases to ensure that families, in particular women and children, are placed in resident ial accommodation in designated countries.  The Government will also ensure that IOM officers are trai ned in child protection issues and that the education needs of children are appropriately addressed, including through thei r attendance at local schools (in-principle agreement has been obtained from Nauru to this effect); through IOM employing staff with suitable child education skills; or through the provision of school aged education within the OPC in bot h English and the children’s native language. These changes will make arrangements for managing the needs of families an d children consistent with those that now apply in Australia following changes made last year.  Ombudsman oversight  The Government will amend the Bill to make clear on the face of the Migration Act that the Ombudsman has powers over the actions of DIMA officers overseas, including in  relation to refugee assessment processes in OPCs, while enhancing those powers through the provision for mandatory t abling of statements of all reports received from the Ombudsman. The Government will also amend the legislation to  specify that the Minister can refer matters to the 

 Ombudsman for investigation.  Paragraph 5(1)(b) of the Ombudsman Act 1976 allows the Ombu dsman to investigate, of his own motion, any action, being action that relates to a matter of administration, taken by a Department. By subsection 3(5), for the purposes of the Ombudsman Act, action that is taken by an officer of a Department is deemed to be taken by the Department. Section 3C of the Ombudsman Act provides that the Act app lies both within and outside Australia. Accordingly, the Ombudsman has jurisdiction to initiate own motion investigatio ns in relation to actions taken by DIMA officers and other Australian officials at OPCs in relation to designated unauthorised arrivals.  The Government notes that legislating access for the Ombud sman is not possible given sovereignty issues relating to declared countries. However, the Government will commi t to negotiate appropriate access arrangements with host countries to allow the Ombudsman to fulfil his role.  As noted above, persons in OPCs are not detained under Australian law. Accordingly the Government does not consider it appropriate to provide for mandatory statutor y reporting on persons in OP Cs. The Ombudsman’s oversight over the actions of DIMA officials over seas, together with the provision under the Bill for the Minister to report to Parliament, will address any issues in this regard.  Costs of system  The Government will continue to manage the costs of the OPCs  in the usual way, noting that there will be a difference between the expected costs of implemen ting these arrangements and DIMA’s existing resourcing, which is based on maintaining capacity for 100 unauthorised arrivals per annum . If additional resources are required by the Ombudsman for expanded activities in relation to OPCs, additional resources will be provided.  Sunset Clauses and Review  The Government will amend the Bill to include provisions t hat commence five years after the legislation, which repeal the provisions which extend the operation of the offshore processing arrangements to all arrivals by sea to Australia. This would have the effect of returning the coverage of the legislation to its current positi on - that is, its application to persons who enter unlawfully at excised offshore places after the excision time for those places. Those who entered prior to this repeal would remain under the provisions of the Bill ensuring that the system  operates seamlessly and that the sunset clause does not provide any ince ntive for asylum seekers to frustrate t he process of resolving their claims in 

 the context of an approa ching sunset date.  The Government will also amend the Bill to require that it commission an independent review two years after the commencement of the legislation, with t he report to be tabled by the Minister.  21 June 2006
