 Media Centre  Minister to Visit Brotherhood of St Laurence 

 24 October 2005 

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, John Cobb, will meet  the staff from the Ecumenical Migration Centre (EMC) when he visits the  Brotherhood of St Laurence today. 

 The Brotherhood of St Laurence incorporated the Ecumenical Migration  Centre into the organisation in 1999.  

 Minister Cobb and EMC staff will discuss the centre’s current projects,  future directions, settlement services and multiculturalism. 

 ‘The EMC is an important source of help for migrants and refugees who  are successfully resettled every year,’ Mr Cobb said. 

 ‘Australia’s settlement services are amongst the world’s most generous  and the Government is committed to ensuring these people have the  support and assistance they need to build a successful life in their new  home. 

 ‘Through this support, migrants and refugees develop a sense of  belonging and are able to contribute to their community socially and  economically,’ Mr Cobb said. 

 The Minister will visit the Brotherhood of St Laurence, 95-97  Brunswick St, Fitzroy on 24 October at 10:30pm.
