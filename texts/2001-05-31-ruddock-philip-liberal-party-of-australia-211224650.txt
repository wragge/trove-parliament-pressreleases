 Labor Asked to Outline Real Detention Policy MPS 067/2001

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock today said that Labor was obliged to outline its plans to house illegal boat arrivals in detention centres in or closer to capital cities.

 Labor's Shadow Minister Mr Sciacca has told ABC radio that he felt the trial, allowing some women and children to live in community housing should be undertaken in detention centres closer to capital cities and not Woomera.

 "The only detention centres in or near capital cities are those in Perth, Melbourne and Sydney, so Mr Sciacca should nominate the capital cities where he wants to locate the detention centres and to accommodate family members in surrounding houses," Mr Ruddock said.

 "This plan would also require that visa overstayers and people found working illegally would need to be moved to Woomera, Pt Hedland or Curtin, pending their removal from Australia, because there would be no room for them elsewhere.

 "Mr Sciacca should also know that there is a shortage of housing at Pt Hedland, so he should explain how a Labor Government would introduce the scheme there and how much it would cost.

 "I am disappointed that Labor has dismissed the Woomera trial before it has even started with Mr Sciacca saying '…it will probably fail because you won't get enough people to volunteer for it. Why would you bother?'"

 "If Mr Sciacca is so concerned that people should be housed near capital cities, he should urge the Queensland Premier Peter Beattie to work with the Government in finding a

 suitable location for a detention centre near Brisbane.

 "Labor is sending conflicting signals that it wants to be firm on visa overstayers and illegal workers, but Premier Beattie says he doesn't want the facilities to detain overstayers and illegal workers located in his state.

 "This is another example of a policy-lazy Opposition that should be spelling out to the community, precisely where it stands on these important issues .
