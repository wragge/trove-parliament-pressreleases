 PRESS RELEASE   

 Joanna Gash MP  Member for Gilmore    

 12 October 2005 

 AUST GOVT HELPS SPREAD KIAMA HARMONY 

 Budding Kiama movie-makers are the latest to benefit from Australian Government's Living in  Harmony initiative.  

 The Kiama Community College has received $31,200 for its Telling Tales project. 

 "The Telling Tales project is a great example of local solutions to local issues," Mrs Gash  said. 

 The Kiama Community College project will seek to increase social acceptance and decrease  the isolation felt by people from non-English speaking backgrounds in the town. 

 Members of the community will be working together to make a 30-minute movie that tells the  stories of six local migrants, refugees and members of the indigenous community. 

 The movie will be made by six local young film-makers and will be shown at a Harmony Day  event and it will be the basis of an educational website, which will be developed as a resource  for use in schools. 

 "It is great to see this project receive the recognition it truly deserves," Mrs Gash said. 

 "Telling Tales is what the Living in Harmony initiative is all about." 

 The Australian Government has allocated $14 million to the Living in Harmony initiative over  four years. More information about the Living in Harmony initiative can be found at  www.harmony.gov.au or by contacting Mrs Gash's Nowra office.
