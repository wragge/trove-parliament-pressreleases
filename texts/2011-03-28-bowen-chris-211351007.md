 The Fourth Bali Process Ministerial Conference   

 

 The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kevin Rudd, and the Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship, Chris Bowen, will be attending the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the Bali  Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime on  30th March.   

 The Bali Process is the key forum in the region for addressing the challenges of people  smuggling and trafficking in persons, bringing together source, transit and destination  countries and international agencies, including the Office of the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration  (IOM).    

 At the Ministerial Conference, Bali Process Ministers will discuss strategies for reinvigorating  cooperation on trafficking in persons, and will renew their commitment to effective  cooperation on border control and law enforcement initiatives to combat people smuggling.   

 The meeting engages more than 40 governments on the complex and difficult issues of  people smuggling and people trafficking.  This meeting will be the first Bali Process  Ministerial Conference to consider the proposal for a regional cooperation framework to  address the irregular movement of people and to combat people smuggling.     

 Australia looks forward to working with Bali Process members at the Ministerial Conference.
