 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs   

 ONA’S STATEMENT ON IRAQ’S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM   

 John Howard’s credibility on Iraq torpedoed by his own intelligence agency   

 The statement by the Director General of ONA on Iraq’s nuclear weapons program torpedoes John  Howard’s credibility on the whole question of the Iraq war.   

 The Director General of ONA stated today that in January 2003 the agency became aware of US State  Department concerns about the veracity of claims about Iraq’s nuclear weapons program - in  particular the claim that Iraq had sought to import uranium from Africa.   

 Yet  in February 2003 John Howard stated to the Australian Parliament and people that:   

 Iraq continues to work on developing nuclear weapons—uranium has been sought from Africa that has  no civil nuclear application in Iraq.   

 John Howard’s new defence is that his own intelligence agency failed to inform him of this matter.    

 Therefore it is not without reason that we have labelled John Howard’s case on Iraq’s nuclear  weapons program as Truth Overboard Volume II. As in Children Overboard, John Howard said the  problem laid with all the people in the armed forces and elsewhere who failed to tell him his claims  about asylum seekers throwing their children overboard were wrong.    

 John Howard’s political defence of his false claim about Iraq’s nuclear weapons program has been  pathetic. A look at the record shows:   

 1. Howard began by saying he was acting entirely on the basis of the information he had  received, on 7 July 2003 stating: “The judgments that we formed were based on the  intelligence reports that our agencies got and I stand by what I said.”   

 2. Then Howard went for a more minimalist defence: “No we didn’t receive that stuff attributed  to that man Wilson, I’ve checked on that”. This of course refers to statements last weekend by  former US Ambassador Joseph Wilson that he visited Africa in February 2002 (12 months  prior to Howard’s parliamentary statement) and concluded the claim about Iraq’s importation  of uranium from Africa was without foundation.    

 Howard’s claim may have been technically correct, as it would be highly improbable for  Australia to have received raw US diplomatic reporting resulting from the Wilson visit to  Africa. But Howard did not answer whether he, or any of his officials, in Washington or  Canberra had seen or heard of the US State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research  conclusions on uranium from Africa and the general proposition about the reconstitution of  Iraq’s nuclear weapons program. The Bureau is the counterpart body of the Office of National  Assessments and the two agencies engage in the regular exchange of each other’s reports and  analyses.

 3. Yesterday morning I posed to Mr Howard and Mr Downer the simple question as to whether  they, or any of their officials in Canberra or Washington, had seen or heard of the Bureau’s 

 conclusions on African uranium and/or the reconstitution of Iraq’s nuclear weapons  program.   

 4. Then mysteriously today the Director General of John Howard’s own intelligence agency (the  ONA) issues a statement stating in fact the ONA was aware of State Department doubts on  the Africa/uranium story before Howard’s February 2003 speech.   

 With the Howard Government, extracting the truth is like extracting blood from a stone.   

 Remember it was Shane Stone, Federal President of the Liberal Party, who wrote two years ago that  Howard Government was seen as being mean, tricky and out of touch. John Howard’s verbal  gymnastics on his false claim about Iraq’s nuclear weapons program represents trickiness par  excellence.   

 What this entire saga demonstrates is that the Howard Government, on a fundamental matter of  Australia’s national security, has misled the Australian people.   

 Ends 10 July 2003
