 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling LABOR CUTS 40 PER CENT OF AFP STAFF  IN JAKARTA DEDICATED TO STOPPING  PEOPLE SMUGGLING May 18, 2013

 The Gillard Government has reduced Australian Federal Police staffing by 40 per cent in Jakarta, despite the booming  people smuggling trade that was reinvigorated by Labor’s decision to abolish the robust border protection regime they  inherited from the Howard Government, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan  said. 

 “At a time when people smuggling is thriving in our region, the Labor Party reduces the AFP’s funding by $45.2 million,  including $24 million from their International Deployment Group.

 “The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bob Carr, recently urged other countries in our region to increase their law enforcement  efforts to stop people smuggling at the Bali Process summit.

 “Yet it turns out that his own Government have in turn reduced the AFP officers assisting the Indonesian National Police in  combatting people smuggling by 40 per cent.

 “As of the 30 June this year, Labor will cut the number of AFP officers in Jakarta by almost half - from five to three, so  drastically reducing the number of officers able to assist the Indonesian police in their fight against people smuggling - regardless of the fact that last month was the biggest month ever on record for illegal boat arrivals.

 “At a time when this country is facing the highest levels of illegal boat arrivals ever in our history, Labor again choses to  cut personnel and staffing from the very frontline agencies tasked with protecting our borders - including $61 million in  funding and 120 staff from the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.

 “This Government is just not serious about stopping the boats and the people smugglers know this,” Mr Keenan said.
