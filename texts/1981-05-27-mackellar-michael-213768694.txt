 JOINT STATEMENT BY THE MINISTERS FOR SOCIAL  SECURITY AND HEALTH 2 ^

 POSITION OF PENSIONERS UNDER NEW HEALTH POLICY, .i

 Claims that 300,000 pensioners would be worse off 

 under the Government's new health policy were today 

 described as misleading and sensationalist by the 

 Ministers for Social Security, the Hon F.M. Chaney 

 and Health, the Hon. M.J.R. MacKellar.

 The Ministers said that these reports completely  misrepresented the Government's policy and caused 

 needless concern for many pensioners and their families  throughout Australia.

 "Close to three million people will be protected by  the Commonwealth through special arrangements to cover 

 their hospital and medical bills under the new policy",  

 the Ministers said. "This figure includes approximately 

 two million pensioners holding pensioner health benefit  cards and their dependants. Their position will not be  altered in any way under the new policy. As well 

 approximately one million disadvantaged persons and 

 dependants will be entitled to such special assistance. By 

 doing so, the Commonwealth is particularly protecting 

 low income earners and their families'.'.

 The Ministers said that recent media claims about the 

 position of those pensioners not entitled to a 

 Pensioner Health Benefit card under the new health policy  were false. "Claims that up to 300,000 pensioners will be 

 worse off are misleading. They do not take into account 

 the fact that many of these people - particularly age 

 pensioners - now have health insurance. They will 

 therefore be better off under the new policy because of the  introduction of the tax rebate of 32 cents in the dollar 

 for the cost of basic health insurance. It must also 

 be remembered that all people over 70 are entitled to an 

 aged pension, irrespective of income. The use of the 

 term "pensioner" without any qualification as to their 

 needs gives an unrealistic impression of the true situation."

 The Ministers said that they regretted that the media 

 reports failed - deliberately or otherwise - to look at 

 the philosophical basis of the Government's health policy. 

 "The Government believes",  Senator Chaney and Mr. MacKellar 

 said, "that those in genuine need should receive special  assistance to cover their hospital and medical bills. Our 

 new policy ensures that nearly three million people will be 

 covered in this way. The Government equally believes that 

 other people in the community are in a position to contribute 

 towards the cost of the health service available to them 

 rather than relying totally on taxpayers to do so. They may 

 do this by either meeting their health costs out of their own 

 pockets or through insurance. The Government recognises 

 that health insurance must be within the reach of the average 

 family. That is why we provide considerable subsidies to 

 ensure that insurance is available at a reasonable cost. A 

 major example of such assistance is the taxation rebate for 

 health insurance."
