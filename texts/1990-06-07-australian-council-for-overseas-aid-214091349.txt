 CAMBODIA^ NO RETURNS WITHOUT AID

 ,f^k/ lwrv\'iy^~ZTpd[ii^ 1  The repatriation of Cambodian boat people to Cambodia must not   go ahead unless the Federal Government restores an official aid   program to Cambodia1,  according to Russell Rollason, Executive   Director of the Australian Council for Overseas Aid.

 ACFOA is convinced these people have not fled persecution but   rather they have fled economic uncertainty and fear of the   possible return of Pol Pot.

 1  To urge Phnom Penh authorities to stop the boats leaving will   amount to little more than wishful thinking unless Australia is   prepared to address the root causes', said Mr Rollason.

 ACFOA urges the Federal Government immediately to recognise the   State of Cambodia,  which would be consistent with the   Government's policy of recognising States and not Governments.   Australia recognises Fiji and has full diplomatic relations  

 although it does not recognise the undemocratic Government in   that country. Australia must also withdraw recognition of the   Khmer Rouge coalition in the United Nations.

 1  Now is the time for Australia to commence a substantial   official aid program, preferably delivered in co-operation with   Australian non-government groups who have 10 years experience   working with the Phnom Penh officials', said Mr Rollason.

 'Such a decision by Australia is important for two reasons.   Firstly, it could well break the international isolation of   Cambodia and lead to a number of other western governments   following - particularly the French, Canadian and Japanese.  

 Secondly, it would put pressure on the international community   to take the next step in the Evan's peace plan now that a   ceasefire has been signed', he concluded.
