 Migrants rush to the Top End 

 There was a big increase last year in the number of migrants who chose to start their new life  in the Northern Territory. 

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Amanda Vanstone today said there was a 32  per cent increase in the number of migrants who settled in the Top End in 2005-2006. 

 ‘The increase from 592 in 2004-2005 to 780 is a credit to the people of the Northern Territory  and their willingness to welcome migrants into the community,’ Senator Vanstone said. 

 ‘Important support networks have been established in the Territory, making it a much more  attractive destination for new migrants looking for a place to settle.’ 

 The largest migrant groups to settle in the Territory in 2005-2006 included the United Kingdom  with 67 new arrivals, India and Indonesia both with 32, Sudan with 45, Philippines with 66 and  Singapore with 47. 

 On the national front, more than 131 000 people arrived and settled in Australia in 2005-2006,  an increase of about 8000 on the previous year. 

 The largest number of settlers came from the United Kingdom with 23 290, up by about 5000  on last year. 

 Other European countries contributed about 7000 migrants, while the number of new arrivals  from Sudan fell almost 2000 from the last year to 3783. 

 Iraqi arrival numbers were up almost 500 to 2425, while more than 52 000 people from 34  Asian countries made Australia their new home during 2005-2006. 

 Senator Vanstone said the majority of new arrivals entered Australia through the family and  skill streams of the migration programme. 

 ‘Our migration target for 2006-2007 is about 140 000, including 97 500 in the skill stream and  that number does not include the 13 000 refugee and humanitarian entrants who will begin  new lives in Australia through our humanitarian programme.’     

 The full list of statistics can be found in Settler Arrivals 2005-2006, a Department of  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs publication that has been published on its website at  www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/index.htm
