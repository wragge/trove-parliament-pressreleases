 The Hon Julie Bishop MP  Minister for Ageing 

 MEDIA RELEASE

 Aged care boost for culturally diverse communities

 A $11.6 million funding boost will give older Australians from culturally diverse  backgrounds better access to care that meets their individual cultural and language needs, the  Federal Minister for Ageing, Julie Bishop, announced today. 

 “As Australia’s population ages, people from culturally and linguistically diverse  communities will make up almost a quarter of the population aged over 65 over the next decade,” Ms Bishop said.

 “That is why the Australian Government is providing funding now to enable aged care  providers to work in partnership with organisations representing culturally diverse  communities, to ensure culturally sensitive and appropriate care is delivered to older Australians.

 “In 2005-06 the Australian Government is providing $2.4 million through the Community  Partners Program to 40 organisations representing culturally diverse communities, including,  for the first time, communities in Queensland, the Northern Territory, Australian Capital  Territory and Tasmania.

 “As well as funding large established communities throughout Australia, such as the Greek  and Italian communities, the Australian Government is providing financial support for the  first time to organisations representing the German, Spanish, Arabic, Turkish, Dutch, Chinese  and Cambodian communities.”

 “The funding will also help smaller culturally and linguistically diverse communities in rural  and regional Australia through organisations such as the Violet Town Bush Nursing Centre in  Victoria, and the Ethnic Communities Council of Queensland for services in Townsville.” 

 The announcement follows the 2005 Federal Budget commitment of $5.1 million in  continuing funding over three years for the Partners in Culturally Appropriate Care initiative.

 The Partners in Culturally Appropriate Care initiative provides funding to link culturally  diverse communities with aged care providers to develop more culturally sensitive services, including providing cross-cultural training for aged care staff.
