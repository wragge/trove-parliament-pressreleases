 Scott Morrison, MP  Shadow Minister for Productivity and Population  Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  Member for Cook 

 

 More boat arrivals since election than in Vietnam crisis  

 30/11/10  

 The arrival of the latest illegal boat, with 65 people on board, means more people  have arrived illegally by boat in the 101 days since the election than arrived in the  fourteen years after the Vietnam War, Shadow Minister for Productivity and  Population & Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said 

 today.  

 “Since the election, just over 100 days ago, 40 boats have arrived with 2,018 people  on board. This is more than the 2,000 Indochinese who arrived by boat in Australia  between 1976 and 1989,” Mr Morrison said.  

 “Boat arrivals have now ramped back up to record levels under Julia Gillard and  Minister Bowen. For the past two months over 700 people have arrived by boat.  People smugglers are back to selling their product aggressively and sending out more  illegal boats than ever. 

 “Under Labor a total of 194 boats have now arrived with 9,367 people on board and  our immigration detention network is failing. 

 “Reports today of yet another escape reflect a detention system in crisis that gets  worse by the day. 

 “As long as Labor are not in control of our borders, they will not have control of our  immigration detention network,” Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr Morrison gave an address to the Lowy Institute in Sydney today that outlined the  Coalition’s comprehensive plan to stop the boats and provided a real plan to address  regional and international asylum issues.
