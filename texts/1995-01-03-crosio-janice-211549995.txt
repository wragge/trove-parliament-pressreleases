 REFUGEES GET EARLIER ACCESS TO PEN SIONS.

 Federal Member for Prospect, Janice Crosio, has welcomed the fact that from 1  January 1995, refugees may be able to receive an Australian pension without having to  meet the prerequisite o f living in Australia for the usual 5 or 10 years.

 “The Government has made this decision because refugees have already suffered  trauma and it is important to give them permanent payments as soon as possible, rather  than short term payments which need to be reviewed regularly.

 “Refugees arc often more disadvantaged than other groups, suffer greater financial and  emotional hardship and have greater difficulty settling into their new homeland.

 “Rather than getting payments such as Special Benefits and Job Search Allowance,  qualified refugees will have access to a pension with a more generous income and  assets tests and the associated pension concessions." Mrs Crosio said.

 About 900 refugees each year are expected to benefit from the change, as well as an  initial 7,000 refugees who have lived in Australia for some time.

 It is expected that the majority of new refugees to benefit this year will be from Indo­ China, the Middle East and the former Yugoslavia.

 More information on qualifications for pensions is available from the Multilingual  Telephone Information Service on 131202.
