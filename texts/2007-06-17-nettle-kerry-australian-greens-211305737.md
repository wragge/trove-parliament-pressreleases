 Refugees will be an election issue: Greens   

 

 17 June 2007   

 Speaking at World Refugee Day rally in Melbourne today, the  Greens’ Spokesperson on Immigration said the treatment of asylum  seekers would be an issue for many people come election day later  this year.    

 “The treatment of asylum seekers will always be a massive blot on  the Howard government’s record,” said Senator Nettle    

 “Many voters will be looking at how the parties treat asylum seekers  when they go to the polls in a few months and both Labor and  Liberal still support mandatory detention. 

 

 “There are still 87 people who have been in immigration detention  longer than 2 years.  One woman has now been detained 6-and-a-half years.  Detention is still an issue.    

 “Just this week I received a petition to stop construction of the  massive new detention centre on Christmas Island.  These issues  leads directly into the consciences of many voters.   

 “Climate change will create 250 million displaced people between  now and 2050.  The government is not doing anything to prepare.   

 “Next week I will introduce a Private Members Bill to formally  recognise and create mechanisms to deal with climate refugees.     

 “The first climate refugees are likely to be in our own Pacific region  from low lying islands.
