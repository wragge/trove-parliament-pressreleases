 TONY ABBOTT:     

 It’s terrific to be here at Hisense Arena to meet with the Opals. I want to thank Lauren Jackson and her team  for making Margie and I so welcome. The Opals have been terrific ambassadors for Australian sport.  They’ve won silver medals at the last three Olympics and obviously the hopes of Australia are buoying them  up and all of us are barracking for them as they go for gold in London.     

 On the subject of sport, it’s been a big night for Australia. Many of us were up late last night watching that  marvellous horse do what it did and it’s just fantastic to see Australians succeeding in England and let’s  hope this is a good omen for the coming Olympics.     

 Can I also observe that this is the second anniversary of the ascession to the Prime Ministership of Julia  Gillard. At the time, she said it was necessary to make the change because "a good government had lost its  way." Well, unfortunately,  it’s now clearly a bad government which is just getting worse and if there is one  thing which symbolises the failure of this government, it is the carbon tax. The carbon tax is symbolic of this  Prime Minister’s failure of judgment, failure of trustworthiness and failure of competence. She went to the  last election saying there would "be no carbon tax under the government I lead." Having said there would be  no carbon tax to win votes, she reversed her position to stay in The Lodge and we now know that there is  going to be a carbon tax bailout of the Point Henry smelter. I fear this is the first of many and the advice the  Coalition has is that the quantum of the bailout almost exactly matches the Alcoa smelter's carbon tax bill.  The best thing you could do for the jobs at Point Henry is to scrap the carbon tax because plainly the carbon  tax is nothing but a jobs killer when it comes to the energy intensive industries of Australia. Without a  carbon tax, Australia can once more be the affordable energy capital of the world and that’s where we  should be.     

 QUESTION:     

 On Point Henry, you have to concede that the high Australian dollar is also having an impact there.     

 TONY ABBOTT:

 Look, there are all sorts of factors at play here but the straw that is breaking the camel’s back is the carbon  tax and, as I said, the advice that the Coalition has is that the quantum of the carbon tax bailout is almost  exactly the quantum of the carbon tax bill.     

 QUESTION:     

 So you oppose the bailout?     

 TONY ABBOTT:     

 Look, we support jobs. We support jobs and we don’t want to jeopardise the continuation of jobs at Point  Henry but the best way to keep jobs going at Point Henry is to scrap the carbon tax and it’s not too late.  Even now, the Prime Minister could see sense and say, look, Australia’s carbon tax is about three times the  level of the carbon price in Europe so we won’t go ahead with it or we will drastically adjust it.     

 QUESTION:     

 There are indications you might be facing internal pressure in the party room over asylum seeker policy and  possible calls to seek a more bipartisan approach. How do you view your party room in this light? What do  you think is going on?     

 TONY ABBOTT:     

 Well, I make two points here. The first point I make is that what’s needed here is not more bipartisanship but  effective policies. What’s needed here is not compromise for compromises' sake but policies that work. It’s  not the Opposition’s policies that have failed here. It’s the Government’s policies that have failed here. This  is a government which inherited a border protection solution and unfortunately it changed policies and we  all see the result. So, that’s the first point I make. The second point I make is that I have seen a report in the 

 paper. I’ve spoken to Malcolm Turnbull this morning and he fully supports the Shadow Cabinet position.     

 QUESTION:     

 If you do face calls in your party room to change your position, how will you respond to that?     

 TONY ABBOTT:     

 Well, it’s the Government’s policies that aren’t working and it’s the Government that needs to change its  policies.     

 QUESTION:     

 So, you don’t see any room for negotiation on Malaysia at all?     

 TONY ABBOTT:     

 Well, I think it’s up to the Government to say what it’s going to do differently and plainly the Malaysian  people-swap is not offshore processing, it’s offshore dumping. There have been thousands of boat people  arrive illegally since this position was first announced and this position is limited to 800 people. So, plainly 

 it’s simply inadequate as a response to the scale of the problem that has been created.     

 QUESTION:     

 Mr Abbott, can I ask you about the Peter Slipper issue? There’s a report in The Weekend Australian strongly  suggesting collusion between the Coalition and a Sydney newspaper. What’s your response to that?

 TONY ABBOTT:     

 There is only one issue here and that is did or did not the Speaker sexually harass a staff member? That’s the  only issue that’s at stake here and it’s before the courts and let the courts come to the conclusion that they  will on this.  

 

 QUESTION:     

 Well, perhaps another issue is did the Coalition collude on it? Can you categorically rule out any collusion  on the Coalition side?     

 TONY ABBOTT:     

 Look, I can categorically rule out that this is some kind of a Coalition stitch-up. It absolutely is not. The only  issue here is did or did not the Speaker of the Parliament sexually harass one of his staff.     

 QUESTION:     

 Are you completely confident that no one on the Coalition side colluded with a Sydney newspaper to  produce this result?    

 TONY ABBOTT:     

 I am completely confident that this has only come about because a member of Mr Slipper’s staff believes  that he has been sexually harassed.     

 QUESTION:     

 The Prime Minister of the Tibetan Government in Exile is in Australia this week, Dr Lobsang Sangay. Do  you have any plans at all to meet him?     

 TONY ABBOTT:     

 Look, I confess that this is the first time I’ve heard of this and as far as I’m aware, there’s been no request  put in. Generally speaking, if the Dalai Lama is in Australia, I’m happy to meet with him as an important  spiritual leader but I have no further plans to meet Tibetans this week.     

 QUESTION:     

 And there’s been no pressure from China at all on you about the visit?     

 TONY ABBOTT:     

 Look, as I said, it’s just not an issue that’s been raised with me.     

 QUESTION:     

 Just back on asylum seeker policy, Julia Gillard’s returning soon. In light of what’s happened near  Christmas Island, isn’t it time that you sat down face to face with her and actually just sorted out some kind  of bipartisan approach?     

 TONY ABBOTT:

 The only way to sort this out is to change the policies that just aren’t working. The only way to fix this  problem is for the Government to do things differently. That’s the only way to fix this problem. Now, if the  Government wants legislation passed through the Parliament, it has an alliance with the Greens under which  the Greens have guaranteed to support matters of confidence. Now, if the Prime Minister thinks a particular  bit of legislation is that important that it must be passed in the national interest, she should declare it to be a  matter of confidence and put it to the Parliament on that basis. It is not the job of the Opposition to support  bad legislation from a failing government. It’s not our job to support legislation that we don’t believe in; in  fact, legislation that we think is wrong - wrong in principle, wrong in practice. It’s not our job to do that. It is  up to the Government to get the legislation that it thinks is necessary through the Parliament.     

 QUESTION:     

 You say Malcolm Turnbull supports the Shadow Cabinet position but there’s suggestions that he wants to  persuade the Shadow Cabinet otherwise on the stand. What can you say about that?     

 TONY ABBOTT:     

 Well, as I said, I’ve spoken to Malcolm this morning. We had a good chat as we always do. He supports the  Shadow Cabinet position. I understand that he’s also responded to the story in the paper today and said that  it’s utterly without foundation.     

 Thank you.
