 REFUGEE STATUS AND HUMANITARIAN CLAIMS  IN IMMIGRATION

 26 October 1990

 Today's announcement of the Introduction of the new system  for determining refugee status and humanitarian stay in Australia  affirms the Opposition's view that case-by-case determination is  the only proper way to address claims.

 The new arrangement maintains the Minister as the principal  decision-maker. The enhanced review procedures, which include  a representative nominated by the Refugee Council of Australia  and nominated by the UNHCR, should be seen as the end of any 

 Merits Review process.

 The Opposition welcomes the Government's decision to ensure  that the Government of the day determines who shall, or shall  not, enter Australia. Merits Reviews in this area is not a 

 matter to be determined through the judicial system.

 It is now well-known and that over 5,000 claims for refugee  status are in the pipeline, with the possibility that many of the  up to 150,000 illegal immigrants in Australia might also seek to  make claims on humanitarian and possibly refugee grounds. The 

 potential number of claims is very large indeed.

 The provision of resources for timely consideration of  these claims and accesss to the Review procedure will need to be  very carefully monitored in order to ensure that a proper 

 compassionate approach is not manipulated by those who have no  genuine claim for protection.
