 ADDRESS TO HENRY LAWSON LABOR COLLEGE, PENRITH  A.L.P. FOREIGN AFFAIRS SEMINAR

 MR LIONEL BOWEN, M.P. '

 DEPUTY LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  AND OPPOSITION SPOKESMAN ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS

 SPEECH ON

 "FOREIGN POLICY UNDER A LABOR  GOVERNMENT"

 EMBARGO UNTIL 8.00PM, 11 AUGUST 1982

 FOREIGN POLICY UNDER A LABOR  GOVERNMENT

 AUSTRALIA IS A "MIDDLE POWER" IN WORLD TERMS.  THIS 

 CLASSIFICATION IN THE COMMUNITY OF THE WORLD'S NATIONS GIVES 

 IT BOTH ADVANTAGES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. IT ALSO IMPOSES ,  

 AN OBLIGATION ON ITS GOVERNMENT TO PURSUE AUSTRALIA'S 

 NATIONAL INTERESTS IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY. TO DO THIS ABROAD, 

 AUSTRALIA NEEDS TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT FOREIGN POLICY.

 I STRESS THE WORD "INDEPENDENT" BECAUSE LATELY THIS HAS BEEN

 CONFUSED WITH THE WORDS

 "NEUTRALIST" OR "NON-ALIGNED". BY INDEPENDENT I MEAN JUST

 THAT, A POLICY WHICH IS MADE IN AUSTRALIA TO SERVE ITS

 FOREIGN INTERESTS BEST, NOT A POLICY WHICH IS DERIVATIVE OF  .  SOME 

 THOSE MADE IN WASHINGTON, OR TOKYO OR LONDON.  /AUSTRALIAN

 GOVERNMENTS HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THEY HAD TO BE "ALL THE

 WAY" WITH SOMEONE - NEVER MIND WHAT THE POLICIES WERE

 PROVIDING THAT THEY WERE THOSE OF THE BIG AND POWERFUL.

 ,/2

 THE FACT THAT THE PERCEPTIONS OF SELF-INTEREST BY BIG AND 

 POWERFUL (AND ALWAYS DISTANT) FRIENDS DO NOT ALWAYS COINCIDE 

 WITH AUSTRALIA'S INTERESTS IS OVERLOOKED. .

 I DON'T MEAN THAT WE NEED TO TURN OUR BACK ON OUR TRADITIONAL 

 FRIENDS AND ALLIES. QUITE THE CONTRARY. WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN 

 OUR TIES WITH THEM, BUT WE ALSO NEED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY 

 OF THE RELATIONSHIP. WE NEED TO CONSULT WITH OUR ALLIES AND 

 MAKE UP OUR OWN MINDS ABOUT ISSUES, NOT JUST TAG ALONG AND DO AS 

 WE ARE TOLD.

 IN THE CASE OF THE EUROPEANS, WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT 

 THOUGH CULTURALLY AND HISTORICALLY WE ARE EUROPEANS ALSO, 

 GEOGRAPHICALLY WE ARE IN A UNIQUE POSITION, SHARED WITH NEW 

 ZEALAND, OF BEING AN ALIEN GROUP IN OUR PART OF THE WORLD.

 NEITHER WE NOR THE EUROPEANS CAN PRESUME TO TAKE EACH OTHER 

 FOR GRANTED.

 IN THE CASE OF JAPAN, WE HAVE A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP WHICH

 BORDERS ON NEO-COLONIALISM - WE PROVIDE RAW MATERIALS IN EXCHANGE  FOR THEIR MANUFACTURED GOODS. THIS NEEDS REASSESSMENT. WE NEED  TO DIVERSIFY THE MARKETS FOR OUR EXPORTS BEFORE WE ARE FORCED TO  DO SO BY THE JAPANESE DIVERSIFYING THE SOURCES OF THEIR IMPORTS  OF RAW MATERIALS SUCH AS BEEF AND COAL.

 ..,/3

 FOR THE U.S., WE ARE A JUNIOR PARTNER, AND RIGHTLY SO, BUT 

 THE EMPHASIS MUST BE ON THE WORD "PARTNER".

 AUSTRALIA MUST MAINTAIN ITS NATIONAL SELF RESPECT AND WHEN 

 DECIDING ON AN ISSUE, THE FIRST QUESTION ASKED SHOULD NOT B E 1 '  

 "WHAT ARE THE AMERICANS DOING ABOUT THIS?" - THIS IS MERELY -  

 ONE OF A SERIES OF QUESTIONS THAT NEED AN ANSWER. AUSTRALIA .

 IS PART OF WHAT IS ARCHAICALLY CALLED THE "WEST" - AN EXPRESSION 

 COINED BY THE BRITISH, WHO REGARDED ASIA AS THE FAR EAST AND 

 THE LEVANT AND THE ARAB COUNTRIES AS THE "MIDDLE EAST".  IT IS 

 RELEVANT TO PAUSE AND REALIZE HOW OUT OF DATE THESE EXPRESSIONS 

 ARE FOR AUSTRALIANS. FOR US AFRICA IS THE WEST, ASIA IS THE 

 NORTH AND THE UNITED STATES ARE THE MIDDLE EAST, WHILE EUROPE 

 IS THE FAR EAST.

 AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN.POLICY NEEDS TO BE CONSISTENT AND CREDIBLE. 

 CONSISTENT IN THAT WE NEED POLICIES AND NOT REACTIONS TO ISSUES. 

 CREDIBLE IN THAT THE POLICIES MUST BE SEEN AS AUSTRALIAN, AND 

 NOT AS STALKING HORSES FOR THE AMERICANS OR THE EUROPEANS.

 ...74

 I

 AFTER CONSOLIDATION OF TRADITIONAL TIES AND A QUALITATIVE 

 CHANGE TO THESE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS, WHAT ARE OUR 

 PRIORITIES?

 FIRST, COME OUR NEIGHBOURS. SOUTH EAST ASIA AND THE SOUTH 

 PACIFIC ARE VERY MUCH THE AREA WHERE OUR BEST DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS 

 NEED TO BE MADE.  WE NEED TO WORK OUT OUR MUTUAL POLITICAL 

 AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS AND INTERESTS, WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES 

 AND AS WELL AS WITH REGIONAL GROUPINGS, SUCH AS ASEAN.

 WE NEED NOT BE ASHAMED THAT WHILE ASIANS GEOGRAPHICALLY,

 WE ARE EUROPEANS CULTURALLY. WE VALUE HUMAN RIGHTS,  GOVERNMENT BY  THE DIGNITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND/DEMOCRACY. WE MUST 

 MAKE IT CLEAR WHEN TRADING WITH ASIAN COUNTRIES, THAT WE 

 MUST PROTECT AUSTRALIAN PRODUCTS FROM IMPORTS MANUFACTURED BY 

 SWEATED LABOUR IN UNSAFE AND UNACCEPTABLE WORKING CONDITIONS. 

 ASIAN WORKERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO UNIONIZE AND TO ENJOY A 

 FAIR RETURN FOR THEIR LABOUR. SIMILARLY PEASANTS WHO 

 WORK FOR LARGE LAND-HOLDERS HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPECT JUSTICE

 .. ./5

 WHICH ONLY THE REFORMS OF LAND HOLDINGS CAN BRING ABOUT.

 WE CAN MAKE OUR VALUES QUITE CLEAR TO OUR NEIGHBOURS 

 WITHOUT BEING SANCTIMONIOUS AND WITHOUT INTERFERING IN THEIR 

 INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

 WE MUST ALSO BE AWARE THAT OUR NEIGHBOURS ARE NOT ONLY GROWING 

 IN SIZE, BUT IN ECONOMIC POWER.

 OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, AT 1975 PRICES, AUSTRALIA'S 

 GPD (GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT) GREW BY 130%, FOR SINGAPORE AND 

 SOUTH KOREA IT WAS 425%.

 FOR JAPAN - 350%

 FOR THAILAND AND MALAYSIA - 300%

 FOR INDONESIA AND THE PHILIPPINES - 200%

 GRANTED, THESE COUNTRIES STARTED FROM A LOWER ECONOMIC BASE 

 THAN OUR OWN, BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT THEIR ECONOMIES ARE 

 MOVING AT A RATE MUCH FASTER THAN OUR OWN.  THE INFRASTRUCTURE 

 WHICH THESE COUNTRIES HAVE CREATED IS IN SOME CASES SUPERIOR 

 TO OUR OWN, IN TECHNOLOGY, IN BANKING, IN THE SERVICE SECTOR, ....76

 . . .  .6

 IN LIGHT MANUFACTURING AND IN THE TOURIST INDUSTRY.  IN PLACES LIKE JAPAN AND SINGAPORE  THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION OF THE WORKFORCE/IS INCREASING WHILE

 ONLY A THIRD OF YOUNG AUSTRALIANS STAY ON AT SCHOOL UNTIL THEIR

 FINAL YEAR, WE NEED NOT ONLY TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO FINISH

 THEIR STUDIES BUT ALSO TO STRENGTHEN THE STUDY OF ASIAN

 CULTURES AND LANGUAGES IN OUR SCHOOLS. BECAUSE OF OUR

 HISTORY AND THE COMPOSITION OF OUR SOCIETY, THERE WILL ALWAYS

 BE AN INTEREST IN EUROPEAN CULTURE AND LANGUAGES. FUNDS

 AND IMAGINATIVE EFFORTS ARE NEEDED IN THE ASIAN FIELDS OF

 STUDY.

 FOR AUSTRALIA 

 A PRIMARY REGION OF CONCERN/IS VIETNAM AND KAMPUCHEA.

 VIETNAM IS ON ITS KNEES ECONOMICALLY. ACCORDING TO RECENT 

 IMF REPORTS, ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY RESERVES ARE ZERO. THE 

 NATURE AND QUALITY OF THE AID VIETNAM IS RECEIVING FROM THE '  

 USSR IS EITHER INADEQUATE OR INEFFICIENTLY MANAGED, OR BOTH. 

 SINCE THE WAR, THE ONLY REAL PROGRESS IN VIETNAM HAS BEEN 

 WITH RICE PRODUCTION, THOUGH ITS ANNUAL YIELD IS STILL SHORT 

 OF THE POPULATION'S NEEDS.

 .... Î 

 ...7

 MAINTAINING 40 DIVISIONS UNDER ARMS IS DEVASTATING TO THE 

 CRIPPLED VIETNAMESE ECONOMY.  OF COURSE VIETNAM TAKES AID FROM 

 THE USSR, AND IN RETURN LETS THE SOVIETS USE CAM RAHN BAY AS A 

 BASE. NO ONE ELSE GIVES IT AID, THE U.S. IS DETERMINED TO 

 KEEP VIETNAM ISOLATED AND NO ONE IS TRYING TO PERSUADE THE 

 VIETNAMESE AND THE CHINESE TO NEGOTIATE OVER THEIR BORDER 

 DISPUTE, TO PERSUADE THE CHINESE TO WITHDRAW SUPPORT FOR THAT 

 GENOCIDAL MANIAC POL POT AND THUS GIVE THE VIETNAMESE TROOPS 

 AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAVE KAMPUCHEA> AND TO SCALE DOWN IN SIZE.

 AUSTRALIA HAS AN OBLIGATION IN THE NAME OF HUMANITY TO BECOME 

 INVOLVED, AS WELL AS IN TERMS OF SELF INTEREST. CONFLICTS IN 

 THAT REGION MEAN REFUGEES AND AUSTRALIA IS THE PLACE THAT ENDS 

 UP WITH THEM.

 RECENTLY, MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONS WITH 

 THE U.S. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ANZUS TREATY AND SECURITY.

 IN THE PAST, AUSTRALIA HAS BEHAVED AS IF IT HAD NOTHING TO

 .. .78

 CONTRIBUTE TO ANZUS - AS IF IT IS THE U.S. THAT BEARS THE 

 WHOLE BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ALLIANCE THAT PROTECTS 

 AUSTRALIA. FIRST, LET'S MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT ANZUS 

 IS NOT A PACT, BUT'A PROMISE TO CONSULT IN THE CASE OF AN 

 ATTACK ON ANY OF THE THREE SIGNATORIES. WHEN WE WERE THREATENED 

 BY INDONESIA IN 1963, WE CONSULTED AND THE AMERICANS TOLD US 

 THAT IT WAS NONE OF THEIR AFFAIR. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE FOLLOWED 

 THE AMERICANS INTO VIETNAM JUST AS WE DID EARLIER IN KOREA. 

 LATELY, AT THE U.S.'S REQUEST, WE SENT TROOPS TO THE SINAI, 

 WITHOUT THE U.N. ENDORSEMENT FOR A PEACE-KEEPING FORCE.

 SIMILARLY, LAST YEAR WE SUPPORTED UNEQUIVOCALLY U.S. MILITARY 

 POLICY IN EL SALVADOR - A POLICY WHICH THE U.S. HAS SINCE 

 MODIFIED. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS GONE ALONG COMPLETELY 

 WITH THE U.S.'S SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL, EVEN TO THE POINT OF 

 WITHHOLDING CONDEMNATION FOR ISRAEL'S DEVASTATION OF LEBANON.

 WHAT EVER THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT DECIDES, BE HE HAWK OR DOVE, 

 REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, IS ALL RIGHT WITH THE AUSTRALIAN

 ./ BA

 GOVERNMENT.

 ANZUS NEEDS TO BE USED MORE EFFECTIVELY BY AUSTRALIA.

 WE CAN USE THE LINKS PROVIDED BY THE ALLIANCE TO PERSUADE 

 THE U.S. TO SEE SOME ISSUES FROM AUSTRALIA'S POINT OF VIEW. 

 THE ALLIANCE IS, AFTER ALL, WITH THE AMERICAN NATION AND 

 WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND NOT SIMPLY WITH A HEAD OF 

 STATE WITH WHOSE POLICIES AT TIMES WE HAPPEN TO DISAGREE.

 THE UNITED

 STATES OF AMERICA IS OUR FRIEND. PRESIDENT REAGAN SAID, "IT 

 TAKES A FRIEND TO TELL YOU WHEN YOU'RE WRONG; SO AUSTRALIA HAS 

 EARNED THE RIGHT TO SPEAK ITS MIND TO THE AMERICANS. WE MUST 

 FACE UP TO THE FACT THAT THE U.S.'S VIEW OF ITS STRATEGIC 

 INTERESTS HAS SHIFTED IN FOCUS. THE PRIMARY AREA OF CONCERN 

 IS EUROPE, CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY LATIN AMERICA AND THE MIDDLE 

 EAST. WHEN THE U.S. TALKS OF THE PACIFIC, IT MEANS JAPAN, KOREA 

 AND TAIWAN - NOT AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND. WHEN IT TALKS OF THE 

 INDIAN OCEAN, AGAIN, IT OVERLOOKS AUSTRALIA AND REFERS TO DIEGO 

 GARCIA AND THE HORN OF AFRICA AND SOVIET EXPANSIONISM IN SOUTH 

 ASIA. WE CAN USE ANZUS TO PERSUADE THE AMERICANS TO PAY MORE 

 ATTENTION TO OUR PERCEPTIONS OF THE STRATEGIC SITUATION IN THE 

 ASIA/PACIFIC REGION.

 THE SOVIET UNION'S INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN IS A MONSTROUS ACT

 OF AGGRESSION, A POTENTIAL THREAT TO THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES,

 AS WELL AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF SOVIET EXPANSIONISM. IT IS NOT,

 AS THE AMERICANS TELL THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, A DIRECT

 THREAT TO AUSTRALIA. THERE IS NO NEED FOR AUSTRALIA TO IMPAIR ITS TRADE WITH THE USSR SIMPLY ON THE SAY-SO OF THE AMERICANS. THE U.S. TRADES VERY ACTIVELY WITH THE SOVIETS, GRANTING THEM  .  ..,/ÎÎ

 10

 EASY CREDITS AND AT THE SAME TIME ATTEMPTS TO PREVENT THE 

 EUROPEANS FROM GOING AHEAD WITH THE GAS PIPE-LINE TO THE SOVIET 

 UNION.

 AUSTRALIA HAS NO NEED TO DISENTANGLE ITSELF FROM THE SOVIET 

 UNION BECAUSE WE HAVE NEVER BEEN CLOSE TO IT - EVEN THOUGH WE 

 WERE ON THE SAME SIDE DURING TWO WORLD WARS. AUSTRALIANS 

 HAVE NEVER BEEN INFLUENCED BY THE SOVIETS. WE DON'T IMPORT 

 SOVIET-MADE CARS NOR DO WE IMITATE THEIR ECONOMIC SYSTEM, NOR 

 DO WE WATCH SOVIET TELEVISION PROGRAMMES. THEIR POLITICAL 

 SYSTEM IS REPUGNANT AND THEIR GOVERNMENT IS A FAILURE. THEIR 

 FOREIGN POLICY IS EXPANSIONIST, MILITARIST AND AGGRESSIVE. IT 

 HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL IN AREAS WHERE IT MATTERED MOST TO THE 

 SOVIETS, SUCH AS ASIA. THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VIETNAMESE 

 IS HELD TOGETHER BY THEIR MUTUAL FEAR OF CHINA AND BY LITTLE ELSE.

 SOVIET INDUSTRY IS IN POOR SHAPE AND THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IS 

 UNPRODUCTIVE. THE SOVIET UNION IS STRONG ONLY IN ARMS, AND THUS 

 IS AN INCOMPLETE SUPERPOWER BECAUSE ITS MILITARY STRENGTH IS 

 NOT MATCHED BY GLOBAL ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, TECHNICAL OR CULTURAL 

 INFLUENCE. THIS YEAR IT GAINED THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE

 ...III

 11

 WORLD'S FOREMOST ARMS SUPPLIER, RELEGATING THE U.S, TO SECOND 

 PLACE. THE ARMS THE USSR SELLS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE 

 PAID FOR IN HARD CURRENCIES, INCLUDING U.S. DOLLARS, AND PROVIDE 

 A THIRD OF THE SOVIET UNION'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS. MILITARY 

 POWER IS CENTRAL TO THE USSR'S POSITION AS A GLOBAL POWER.

 MILITARY MIGHT IS THE PRINCIPAL FOREIGN POLICY ASSET OF THE 

 SOVIET UNION AND AS ITS PERFORMANCE IN ECONOMIC.SPHERES CONTINUES 

 TO DECLINE, IT COULD WELL BECOME AN EVEN GREATER SHOWCASE OF 

 SOVIET GLOBAL INFLUENCE.

 WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THE USSR WILL ABANDON THE DISASTROUS 

 COURSE OF BUILDING UP ARMS AND CONCENTRATE MORE ON ECONOMIC 

 DEVELOPMENT, AT LEAST FOR THE SAKE OF ITS OWN PEOPLE. TO DO THIS, 

 IT WILL HAVE TO OVERCOME THE LESSONS OF ITS HISTORY, AND NOT 

 CONTINUE TO BE HAUNTED BY THE MEMORY OF WORLD WAR II WHICH 

 RESULTED IN 20 MILLION SOVIET DEAD.

 AUSTRALIA MUST RESTORE FULL CONTACT WITH THE SOVIET UNION IN THE 

 CULTURAL AND SCIENTIFIC AREAS AND USE THESE LINKS TO PUT OUR

 POINT OF VIEW ON SECURITY MATTERS WHICH AFFECT AUSTRALIA'S ...712

 INTEREST AND WORLD PEACE. NOTHING IS ACHIEVED BY CUTTING 

 OURSELVES OFF FROM THE SOVIET UNION IN ALL VENUES SAVE THE 

 MARKET PLACE.

 JAPAN WILL BE A COUNTRY WHERE THE ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF AN 

 AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN POLICY WILL BE DOMINANT. THE GOVERNMENT 

 HAS DONE LITTLE, IF ANYTHING, TO COORDINATE THE RESOURCES 

 NEGOTIATIONS WHICH WE CONDUCT WITH THE JAPANESE WHO HAVE 

 ALWAYS USED THEIR POWER AND THE CLOSE COOPERATION OF STATE .  

 AND CORPORATE BODIES TO PRESENT A UNITED FRONT AND THUS TO 

 DIVIDE AND CONQUER.

 THE NINE JAPANESE CONGLOMERATES ARE AMONG THE MOST 

 POWERFUL TRADING COMPANIES IN THE WORLD :  FIVE ARE RANKED 

 AMONG THE WORLD'S TEN LARGEST COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES AND 

 TOGETHER ACCOUNT FOR HALF OF JAPAN'S WORLD TRADE. DEALING 

 WITH SUCH GIANTS IN THE PIECE-MEAL WAY THAT WE DO IS RIDICULOUS.

 __12

 .../13

 THE TASK OF AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMACY IS TO SUSTAIN AUSTRALIA'S 

 WEIGHT AND INFLUENCE AND TO ENSURE THAT THE NATIONAL INTEREST 

 IS PROTECTED AND ADVANCED. AUSTRALIA'S ROLE IS SEEN BY 

 THIS GOVERNMENT SOLELY AS THAT OF PROVIDER OF CHEAP RAW 

 MATERIALS, ENERGY AND MINERALS TO THE INDUSTRIAL GIANTS.

 THIS GOVERNMENT EQUATES MINERAL EXPORTS WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH, 

 AND COMPLETELY IGNORES THE REAL STRENGTH OF AUSTRALIA, WHICH 

 LIES IN THE SKILL AND INDUSTRIOUSNESS OF ITS PEOPLE.

 THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT MUST BECOME MORE INVOLVED IN 

 MONITORING AND PLANNING THE PROCESS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF 

 OUR COUNTRY, IF THE LIVING STANDARDS OF THE MAJORITY OF 

 AUSTRALIANS ARE TO BE MAINTAINED. IF THIS IS NOT DONE, THEN 

 WE SHALL SEE EVEN GREATER LEVELS OF FOREIGN OWNERSHIP 

 AND CONTROL OF AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES AND RESOURCES, THE

 .....13

 .. , / m

 DISMANTLING OF IMPORTANT SECTIONS OF AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES, 

 PARTICULARLY THE WEAKER SECTORS OF MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES, 

 INCREASED DISPARITIES IN LIVING STANDARDS BETWEEN THE VARIOUS 

 GROUPS IN THE COMMUNITY AND AN ACCELERATION OF THE PROCESS. .

 OF UNEVEN DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN THE VARIOUS REGIONS AND STATES 

 OF AUSTRALIA.

 AT THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE HELD IN CANBERRA FROM 5 - 9 JULY 

 THE PARTY APPROVED A COMPREHENSIVE PLATFORM OF FOREIGN POLICY, 

 WHICH WILL SERVE AS THE BLUEPRINT FOR LABOR'S CONDUCT OF 

 AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN AFFAIRS. THE FOSTERING OF GENUINE WORLD 

 PEACE IS SEEN AS PARAMOUNT IN THE PLATFORM.

 THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL PROBLEMS IS THE THREAT TO THE WORLD 

 POSED BY THE MASSIVE NUCLEAR ARSENAL HELD BY THE TWO SUPERPOWERS 

 AS WELL AS BY THE UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE AND CHINA. UNDER A 

 LABOR GOVERNMENT AUSTRALIA WILL WORK ASSIDUOUSLY TO CREATE AN 

 ATMOSPHERE OF TRUST AND COOPERATION IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.

 AUSTRALIA WILL DO WHAT IT CAN TO PERSUADE GOVERNMENTS WHO HAVE 

 ARMY UNITS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO REMOVE THEM. NOTHING

 ...14

 .../15

 ....15

 CONTRIBUTES TO INSTABILITY MORE THAN THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN 

 TROOPS IN A COUNTRY'S OWN TERRITORY.

 THE LABOR PARTY OPPOSES BOTH THE HORIZONTAL AND THE VERTICAL 

 PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND OF ALL MEANS OF MASS 

 DESTRUCTION. IT STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE START. (STRATEGIC 

 ARMS REDUCTION TALKS) AND WILL WORK TO HAVE ALL NUCLEAR 

 TESTING BANNED. FRANCE NO LONGER ACCEPTS THE JURISDICTION OF 

 THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE (ICJ) SO WE WONT BE ABLE 

 TO TAKE THE FRENCH TO COURT OVER THEIR PERSISTENT TESTING IN 

 THE SOUTH PACIFIC. HOWEVER, WE SHALL NOT LIMIT OUR OPPOSITION 

 TO MERELY REGISTERING A PROTEST WITH THE GOVERNMENT IN PARIS.

 A LABOR GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO TRY TO PERSUADE THE MAJOR ARMS 

 SELLERS TO PUT A CEILING ON CONVENTIONAL ARMS SALES. AS THE 

 LABOR PARTY SUPPORTS A NUCLEAR WEAPON FREE PACIFIC, A LABOR 

 GOVERNMENT WOULD DO ALL IT COULD TO PERSUADE OUR NEIGHBOURS, 

 SUCH AS THE PHILIPPINES, TO RESIST ANY ATTEMPT BY THE U.S.

 ------- 716

 ....16

 TO STOCKPILE NUCLEAR WEAPONS ON THEIR TERRITORY. WE HAVE MADE 

 IT QUITE CLEAR THAT WE WOULD NOT ALLOW U.S. NUCLEAR WEAPONS 

 TO BE KEPT IN AN ARSENAL IN AUSTRALIA, NOR WOULD WE ALLOW THE 

 LAUNCHING FROM AUSTRALIAN TERRITORY OF U.S. OPERATIONS INVOLVING 

 NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

 THE FAILURE OF THE U.N. SECOND SPECIAL SESSION ON DISARMAMENT 

 MAKES IT IMPERATIVE FOR INITIATIVES FOR DISARMAMENT TO BE 

 PURSUED OUTSIDE A U.N. CONTEXT. A LABOR GOVERNMENT WOULD 

 CONVENE A CONFERENCE OF ALL SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE COUNTRIES 

 WITH THE VIEW OF MAKING OUR HEMISPHERE FREE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

 LARGE AREAS OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE ARE ALREADY NUCLEAR 

 WEAPONS-FREE, BY TREATY. .

 FIRST, THE ENTIRE ANTARCTIC CONTINENT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED 

 AS A NUCLEAR FREE ZONE BY THE ANTARCTIC TREATY OF 1961.

 BOTH THE SUPERPOWERS, AS WELL AS ARGENTINA AND SOUTH AFRICA 

 (TWO NATIONS WITH NUCLEAR POTENTIAL) ARE PARTIES TO THIS TREATY.

 , . . . / 16A

 .... 16A

 SECONDLY, THE TREATY OF TLATELOLCO OF 1967 HAS ESTABLISHED 

 THE WHOLE OF LATIN AMERICA, FROM MEXICO TO ARGENTINA, AS 

 A NUCLEAR WEAPONS-FREE ZONE. THE SUPERPOWERS AND THE NORTHERN 

 HEMISPHERE NUCLEAR WEAPON COUNTRIES HAVE ALSO BOUND THEMSELVES 

 NOT TO INSTALL, TEST, MANUFACTURE OR FIRE NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN 

 THIS REGION.

 THIRDLY, WELL OVER 100 NATIONS, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA AND ALMOST 

 ALL OF THE NATIONS IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE HAVE COMMITTED 

 THEMSELVES TO THE NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY (NPT) WHICH 

 PLEDGES THEM NOT TO OWN, TEST OR LAUNCH NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 

 INDONESIA HAS RECENTLY SIGNED THE N.P.T.

 FOURTHLY, IN LATE 1975, A U.N. PROPOSAL TO FORM THE SOUTHERN 

 PACIFIC INTO A NUCLEAR WEAPONS-FREE ZONE WAS SUPPORTED BY 110 

 NATIONS, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA.

 .  DECIDED 

 FINALLY, THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE AFRICAN STATES HAVE 

 AT BOTH THE UNITED NATIONS AND AT THE ORGANISATION FOR

 ...716B

 ... .16B

 AFRICAN UNITY/ THAT THEY WISH TO REMAIN NUCLEAR WEAPONS FREE.

 IT IS NOT "UNREALISTIC" TO DISTINGUISH STRATEGICALLY BETWEEN 

 THE TWO HEMISPHERES. THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE CAN BE MADE SECURE 

 FROM THE THREAT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS BY MEANS OF AN INTERNATIONAL 

 AGREEMENT. SUCH AN AGREEMENT WOULD NOT PRECLUDE TRANSIT 

 THROUGH THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE OF NUCLEAR CAPABLE VESSELS, IN 

 ACCORDANCE WITH ACCEPTED PRACTICE OF INTERNATIONAL MARITIME LAW.

 A LABOR GOVERNMENT WOULD ENSURE THAT THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN 

 BASES IN NO WAY INVOLVED A DEROGATION OF AUSTRALIAN SOVEREIGNTY 

 AND THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE 

 STRATEGIC ASPECTS OF THE U.S. COMMUNICATION STATIONS WORK.

 WE RECOGNISE THAT INEQUALITIES OF WEALTH, OPPRESSION AND 

 INJUSTICE NOT ONLY RESTRICT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BUT MORE 

 IMPORTANTLY CREATE CONFLICTS AND TENSIONS BETWEEN NATIONS.

 THESE CAUSES OF FRICTION MUST FIRST BE REMOVED IF THE WORLD 

 IS TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER DISMANTLING ITS ARSENAL. IN OUR 

 REGION ALONE, FOOD WILL BE A MAJOR SOURCE OF FRICTION :  INDIA, 

 CHINA, INDONESIA, BANGLADESH HAVE A COMBINED POPULATION OF 

 OVER TWO BILLION PEOPLE. TRANSFERS OF FOOD WILL HAVE TO INCREASE

 ,,./17

 ,...17

 TO FEED THE HUNGRY AND TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURES WILL 

 ALSO HAVE TO BE IMPROVED SO AS TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF 

 NATURAL CALAMITIES IN THESE COUNTRIES. '

 THE LABOR PARTY PLEDGED RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND 

 REAFFIRMED ITS COMMITMENT TO THE TENETS OF THE CHARTER OF 

 THE UNITED NATIONS. AN AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT WILL 

 WORK TOWARDS NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT AND TOWARDS THE ESTABLISHMENT 

 OF A NEW INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER SO AS TO GIVE DEVELOPING 

 COUNTRIES A CHANCE TO IMPROVE THE LIVING STANDARDS OF THEIR 

 PEOPLE.

 LABOR IS COMMITTED TO INCREASE AID DISBURSEMENTS FROM THE 

 PRESENT M  OF GNP TO .7% OF GNP AND TO AN EVENTUAL U.N. 

 APPROVED TARGET OF 1% OF GNP. FOREIGN AID IS NOT TO BE USED 

 TO SECURE ANY POLITICAL, MILITARY OR COMMERCIAL ADVANTAGE FOR 

 AUSTRALIA AT THE EXPENSE OF THE RECIPIENT. AID IS AN 

 INSTRUMENT OF FOREIGN POLICY AND THUS'THERE MUST BE VERY CLOSE 

 COORDINATION OF FOREIGN POLICY AND DISBURSEMENTS FOR AID 

 PROJECTS. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT AID REACH THOSE THAT

 ....718

 ...18

 NEED IT MOST. WITH THIS END IN MIND, THERE IS A NEED TO 

 EXAMINE THE WORK OF NON GOVERNMENT ORGANISATIONS (NGO'S) IN THE 

 AID AREA TO SEE WHETHER THEY MIGHT BE BETTER PLACED THAN 

 GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO DELIVER AID TO THE GRASS ROOTS LEVEL.

 AUSTRALIA NEEDS ALSO TO COOPERATE MORE CLOSELY WITH OTHER AID 

 DONOR COUNTRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE COULD COORDINATE OUR AID 

 EFFORT IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC WITH THAT OF NEW ZEALAND TO 

 ELIMINATE ANY DUPLICATION OF EFFORT AND THUS MAXIMISE THE 

 BENEFITS TO THE RECIPIENTS.

 TO CONDUCT AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN POLICY PROPERLY, WE NEED TO

 HAVE AN EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT MACHINE WHICH CAN REACT TO

 MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. AN ARTICLE IN THE SYDNEY MORNING  OF 3 JULY  HERALD/ACCURATELY DESCRIBED THE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS 

 AS A HOUSE OF STRAW. THE ARTICLE WAS DEPRESSINGLY ACCURATE.

 THE DEPARTMENT HAS NO REAL ROLE TO PLAY, HAVING BEEN SQUEEZED 

 OUT OF THE POLICY ADVISORY DEPARTMENTS BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 

 A FOREIGN POLICY DIVISION IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE PRIME

 ,../19

 MINISTER AND CABINET AND BY THE RETENTION BY THE PRIME MINISTER 

 OF A MOTLEY COLLECTION OF ADVISERS ON FOREIGN POLICY.

 THE DEPARTMENT IS UNDER-STAFFED AND ITS MEMBERS DEMORALIZED.

 THE PROPOSED REORGANISATION OF THE DEPARTMENT WILL CREATE A 

 FEW MORE HIGH LEVEL JOBS, BUT DO NOTHING TO IMPROVE EITHER 

 ITS EFFICIENCY OR THE CAREER PROSPECTS FOR THE MORE JUNIOR 

 OFFICERS.

 A LABOR GOVERNMENT, MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, WOULD HAVE AN ACTUAL 

 FOREIGN POLICY FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO IMPLEMENT.

 TO REVITALISE THE MANAGEMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT WE WOULD 

 APPOINT ON A CONTRACT BASIS INCUMBENTS TO A NUMBER OF KEY 

 POLICY JOBS. SIMILARLY, HEADS OF MISSION TO THE MORE 

 IMPORTANT OVERSEAS POSTS WOULD ALSO BE APPOINTED UNDER 

 CONTRACT. PERMANENT PUBLIC SERVANTS, PROFESSIONALS FROM .

 THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND ANYONE ELSE QUALIFIED TO TAKE ON A 

 KEY POLICY JOB WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY AND THE BEST WOULD 

 BE CHOSEN.

 ...19

 ,/20

 ...20

 WHEN WE SPEAK OF FOREIGN POLICY WE INCREASINGLY MEAN FOREIGN 

 ECONOMIC POLICY. IT IS BOTH A DUPLICATION OF EFFORT AND A HAIR­

 SPLITTING LUXURY TO MAKE FOREIGN AFFAIRS RESPONSIBLE FOR 

 ECONOMIC POLICY AND THE TRADE COMMISSIONER SERVICE OF THE 

 DEPARTMENT OF TRADE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMMERCIAL WORK. THE 

 TRADE COMMISSIONER SERVICE SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE 

 DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO ENSURE THE MAXIMUM COORDINATION 

 OF AUSTRALIA'S EFFORT AT FOREIGN RELATIONS, BOTH COMMERCIAL AND 

 POLITICAL.

 THE STATE GOVERNMENTS SHOULD BE PERSUADED TO CLOSE DOWN THEIR 

 OFFICES ABROAD, AS THESE AT TIMES WORK AT CROSS PURPOSES TO 

 THE EMBASSIES. BY THE SAME TOKEN, WE WOULD HAVE TO ENSURE 

 THAT EMBASSIES WOULD BE APPROPRIATELY STAFFED TO ADVANCE AND 

 PROTECT THE SPECIAL INTERESTS OF THE STATES, BUT NOT TO THE 

 DETRIMENT OF THE INTERESTS OF AUSTRALIA AS A WHOLE.

 TO ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT KIND OF INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE TO

 THE GOVERNMENT, WE WOULD DESIGNATE SENIOR OFFICIALS IN A .../21

 ..,.21

 NUMBER OF OUR EMBASSIES AS RESPONSIBLE FOR RELATIONS WITH LARGE 

 MULTI-NATIONALS, MANY OF WHOM HAVE ANNUAL BUDGETS WHICH ARE LARGER 

 THAN THOSE OF A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES WITH WHICH AUSTRALIA 

 EXCHANGES AMBASSADORS. x

 WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP SPECIALISTS IN 

 AREAS OF VITAL INTEREST TO AUSTRALIA. WE HAVE MADE A START 

 BY HAVING A HANDFUL OF OFFICERS WHO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF 

 CHINA AND JAPAN. HOWEVER, WE HAVE NO ONE WHO IS A SPECIALIST 

 IN U.S. AFFAIRS. WE ASSUME, WRONGLY, THAT BECAUSE WE SHARE A 

 COMMON LANGUAGE WE KNOW ALL ABOUT ONE ANOTHER. THE U.S.A. SECTION 

 IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS SERVES THE FUNCTIONS OF A POST OFFICE. IN 

 THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT THERE ARE TWO OFFICIALS DEALING WITH 

 AUSTRALIA AND WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED DEALING WITH ISRAEL. AT A 

 TIME WHEN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ARE COMPLEX AND REQUIRE 

 A TEAM OF SKILLED EXPERTS, AUSTRALIA IS ALLOWING ITS FOREIGN 

 SERVICE TO BECOME A HOUSE OF STRAW.

 ,../22

 THE QUALITY OF THINKING DONE IN AUSTRALIA ON STRATEGIC 

 MATTERS IS POOR. WE SHOULD REVIEW THE WORK BEING DONE BY 

 THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS AND BY THE JOINT INTELLIGENCE 

 ORGANISATION TO ENSURE THAT FOREIGN AFFAIRS' ROLE OF 

 REPORTING TO THE GOVERNMENT ON MATTERS AFFECTING BOTH DIPLOMACY 

 AND STRATEGIC AFFAIRS, IS NOT ERODED ANY FURTHER. THE 

 DEPARTMENT SHOULD HAVE A CAPACITY FOR LONG TERM POLICY 

 PLANNING.

 THE WORK DONE BY THE AUSTRALIAN SECRET INTELLIGENCE SERVICE 

 (ASIS) IS OUTDATED AND COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE.

 ...22

 A DIPLOMATIC SERVICE IS NOT A LUXURY. NO COUNTRY CAN DO WITHOUT 

 ONE IF IT IS TO PLAY ITS PART IN THE COMMUNITY OF NATIONS.

 WHILE THE TELEGRAM, TELEVISION AND THE AEROPLANE HAVE CHANGED 

 THE SPEED OF DIPLOMACY AS WELL AS ITS ASPECT, IT HAS NOT 

 ALTERED ITS BASIC FUNCTION, NAMELY TO REPRESENT THE INTERESTS

 ./23

 ...23

 OF THE GOVERNMENT AND OF THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA TO FOREIGN 

 GOVERNMENTS WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS. IT IS IMPORTANT ,  

 THAT AUSTRALIANS REALISE THAT EVENTS THAT TAKE PLACE ABROAD DO II  HAVE AN EFFECT ON THEIR DAILY LIVES. JUST AS NO MAN IS A N ; .ENTIRE n

 ISLAND^UNTO HIMSELF,' SO NOW ARE COUNTRIES' DESTINIES CLOSELY 

 INTER-RELATED.

 IF WE ARE TO PURSUE EFFECTIVELY AUSTRALIA'S INTERESTS ABROAD, 

 TWO THINGS ARE NEEDED. A COHERENT FOREIGN POLICY AND A WELL- 

 MANAGED GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENTALITY TO IMPLEMENT IT. THE 

 FORMER THE LABOR PARTY HAS ALREADY. THE LATTER WILL BE A 

 PRIORITY FOR THE LABOR FOREIGN MINISTER.
