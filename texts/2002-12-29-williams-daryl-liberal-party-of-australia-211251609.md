 Philip Ruddock MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS  AFFAIRS

 Transcripts

 Baxter detention centre fires

 Doorstop interview, Perth, 29 December 2002

 Acting Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs the Hon Daryl Williams, AM QC MP

 Reporter: Mr Williams, could you just start off by giving us your reactions to the Baxter detention centre fire?

 Daryl Williams: Well let me just explain that what seems to have happened is that there have been fires lit in the Baxter detention centre in a  particular compound and something like 17 out of 19 residential units have been damaged or destroyed.

 These units are modern accommodation, built to national building standards. They are air-conditioned with en suites.

 The occupants of the compound were, in the main, single males and all of them have had an application for refugee status  refused at some stage. Some of them are on the basis of appeal.

 Reporter: (inaudible)

 Daryl Williams: Well, it’s treated as a possible crime. The Australian Federal Police are investigating. Now if, as is apprehended, the fires  were deliberately lit, then the Government expresses outrage and concern that this should have happened.

 It puts at risk the safety of detainees not engaged in criminal acts.

 It risks the lives and safety of staff and it, in this case, puts at risk the lives and safety of firefighters.

 In addition to that, we’ve got an estimate by the fire brigade of $2 million worth of damage. Now that is taxpayers’ money  that is just wasted.

 If the people responsible for lighting fires believe that this will assist them in coercing the Government to let them stay in  Australia, they are wrong.

 It can only count against them. If character issues become relevant, it obviously says something about the character of the  people involved.

 Reporter: Do you support calls that Mike Rann has made that if the culprits, the people who have done it, are caught they should be  deported?

 Daryl Williams: In most cases, the people who are occupy the compound, as I have said, have had an application for refugee status refused.  Some are bringing appeals.

 Now the difficulty with immediately deporting anybody in these circumstances is, when their appeal processes have  concluded, in some cases, they have destroyed travel documents and determining their identity and the country to which they  should be deported is not a straight forward exercise.

 Reporter: So what’s the road for them…(inaudible)…explain the process that anyone who’s caught will have to go through?

 Daryl Williams: If anybody is found to, or is alleged to have committed a criminal act, I expect they will be prosecuted and, if prosecuted, the  justice system will apply.

 And, assuming that they don’t have a visa, then at the end of any sentence, or the completion of any punishment, one would  expect that they would be deported if feasible to do it.

 Reporter: The Baxter centre was supposed to be a, I suppose you could say, a high-tech sort of place where these sorts of problems  weren’t expected to occur and it was only supposed to be places like Woomera where these problems occur.

 Daryl Williams: Well the facilities at Baxter are modern and of a high standard. They don’t only include residential accommodation with en  suite, they have recreational facilities like TV, computers, and a gym.

 So it can’t be by reason of any complaint about the standard of facilities that anybody could take action like setting fire to the  centre.

 Reporter: Do you have any sympathy for them? We’ve had up in the north, at Christmas Island off WA, there’s been quite a few riots  lately. There obviously is a lot of simmering resentment up there. Do you personally have any sympathy for them?

 Daryl Williams: Well if somebody applies for refugee status and is refused, then they don’t have a lawful reason for staying in Australia and  they should be deported.

 What I think we see in actions by detainees is a determination to get what they paid money to people smugglers for. It makes  the determination of the Government to stamp out people smuggling all the greater.

 Reporter: In terms of security, will you be putting forward any new measures for the compound so the…(inaudible)

 Daryl Williams: Well at this stage the Department is still examining what has occurred and what needs to be done. At this point, I can’t make  any comment.

 Reporter: The South Australian Government has criticised the Commonwealth for not allowing greater cooperation between local fire 

 fighting authorities and the immigration centre staff.

 Daryl Williams: Well I’m not aware of that particular criticism and I can’t comment on it. I have to consult Mr Ruddock’s office before I can  comment on that matter.

 Reporter: Do you know if they’ve got anyone in mind who have…(inaudible)

 Daryl Williams: No, I’m not aware. The AFP are treating the scene as a crime scene and are investigating it. And if anybody has been  responsible for lighting fires, they will be dealt with appropriately.

 Reporter: ..(inaudible)..without residential..(inaudible)

 Daryl Williams: Well they will have to be accommodated elsewhere in the centre. At this stage I’m not aware of any detail on that.
