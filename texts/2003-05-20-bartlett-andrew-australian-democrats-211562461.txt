 Ruddock must go: abject failure of care   

 The Australian Democrats are calling for the Minister for Immigration Philip Ruddock to resign or  be removed from his role, following allegations aired on Four Corners last night. 

 Leader of the Australian Democrats and Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said  the allegations raised are not new, but they crystallise the issues surrounding the policy of  mandatory detention.  

 “It is an inhumane policy with a human impact. When we establish a regime which is designed to  punish innocent people, it is only natural that respect for the law and for basic human decency goes  out the window,” said Senator Bartlett. 

 “Internal considerations of breach of contract conditions are not enough. 

 “An independent judicial inquiry must be carried out and Mr Ruddock must resign or be removed  from his role as Immigration Minister. 

 “We have more than enough evidence that the Minister has neglected medical advice, has ignored  independent evidence and that the treatment of all asylum seekers under his regime has crossed the  line. What we need is for that evidence to be consolidated and action taken. 

 “The Minister has misled the public for three years on the issue of asylum seekers whilst overseeing  a policy which has resulted in numerous deaths, hundreds of people psychologically damaged and a  real decline in the physical health of people under his care. 

 “I have been to every detention centre in Australia and whilst some have better fit outs than others,  the mental and physical deterioration of people locked up with no hope is the same in every centre. 

 “Last year, Senator Stott Despoja and I visited Woomera and saw the appalling conditions first  hand. 

 “I visited Baxter earlier this year and while it may be a more modern facility, the human suffering  was still evident. 

 “The Democrats have begun our own investigations into the damage that is being done in  Australia’s detention centres and are in the process of finalising details for a forum in June. 

 “We will be gathering legal and health experts together to see if there are any avenues for legal  action against the Minister for failure to carry out his duty of care towards these people.  

 “Woomera may now be shut down but the damage both physical and mental to detainees and staff  goes on. 

 “Whole families have been destroyed, and children and very young people have acquired mental  health problems which may last a lifetime, with the army of community volunteers who try to assist  finding themselves helplessly watching good people get sicker every day,” concluded Senator  Bartlett.
