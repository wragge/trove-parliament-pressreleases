 Media  release       26  May  2005  

 GRANT FUNDING BOOST FOR THE MULTICULTURAL COUNCIL OF  WAGGA WAGGA INC.   

 

 The Nationals Member for Riverina, Kay Hull, today announced that the Multicultural Council of  Wagga Wagga has been granted $153,620 to help with an information, referral and advocacy  service to African refugees in the Wagga Wagga area. The project will also assist dependents of  skilled migrants.   

 Multicultural Council of Wagga Wagga will assist migrants and refugees, from some of the poorest  and most war-ravaged countries in the world, settle in the local area.    

 “This year the majority of the 13,000 humanitarian entrants to arrive in Australia will have a limited  knowledge of western culture, and speak very little English,” said Kay Hull.    

 Multicultural Council of Wagga Wagga plays an essential role to help migrants and refugees  develop a sense of belonging in their new community while providing them with every opportunity  to realise their ambition for themselves and their families,” Kay Hull said.   

 “Organisations such as Multicultural Council of Wagga Wagga assist migrants and refugees to find  accommodation, employment and provide English language training and health care.   

 In 2005/ 06 the Australian Government will spend a record $30 million on programs to help  migrants and refugees settle as quickly as possible in their new homes.   

 Australia is internationally recognised as a world leader in settlement services with dedicated  resettlement programs delivered by organisations such as the Multicultural Council of Wagga  Wagga to help our recent arrivals to settle into their new home.   

 A full list of grant recipients and general information about the new grants is available at  www.immi.gov.au/grants.
