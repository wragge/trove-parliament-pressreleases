 NEWS RELEASE SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

 VIETNAMESE INCURSIONS INTO THAILAND

 Mr Michael Mackellar,  the Opposition Spokesman on Foreign  Affairs, today deplored the Government's continuing refusal 

 to condemn the attacks by Vietnam's army of occupation in 

 Cambodia against refugee camps in the Thai/Kampuchean 

 border region and Vietnam's incursions into Thai territory.

 Mr Mackellar said that the Government's silence over 

 Vietnam's indiscriminate attacks against innocent  Cambodian refugees has the effect of isolating Australia 

 in the region, and could, only add to increased uncertainty  overseas as to Australia's future foreign policy  direction.

 "The Government has a clear and urgent obligation to 

 clarify reports that it has not responded to approaches 

 from Thailand or ASEAN for Australia's condemnation of 

 Vietnam's activities". He said that the Australian 

 people had a right to know if and when any such approach 

 or approaches were made and the reasons for the 

 Government's reluctance to respond.

 Mr Mackellar Â·  said that the Government's failure to 

 condemn Vietnam's actions, with or without prompting, was 

 a new and very disturbing trend in Australia's foreign  policy.
