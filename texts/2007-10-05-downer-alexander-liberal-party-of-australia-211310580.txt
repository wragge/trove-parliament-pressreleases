 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 ALEXANDER DOWNER  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  AA 07 87  5 October 2007 

 Australia to Provide Humanitarian Assistance to the People of  Burma   Australia will provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma, whose condition has been made  more difficult by the violent suppression of pro-democracy protests. 

 We will contribute $3 million to the World Food Programme's emergency appeal for Burma, to help  deliver food to vulnerable people across the country. 

 The World Food Programme assists up to 1.6 million people in Burma - over half of them women. 

 Australia will also give funds to CARE Australia ($800,000) and the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees ($500,000) to support basic health, water and sanitation for vulnerable  people along the south-east as well as northern borders of Burma. 

 Australia is one of a few donors providing humanitarian assistance inside Burma. Our multilateral and  NGO aid partners are well positioned to provide immediate and targeted assistance to the most  vulnerable people, including the internally displaced, and have extensive experience in delivering aid in  difficult operating environments. The regime does not have access to our humanitarian assistance. 

 Australia will continue to closely monitor the situation in Burma to ensure that our $4.3 million  humanitarian assistance package is targeted to the ongoing needs of the people. 

 Total Australian aid to Burma is an estimated $14 million in 2007-08.
