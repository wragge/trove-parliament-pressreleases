 Senator Kerry Nettle 

 Senator for New South Wales 

 

 Greens call on Mark Latham to  commit to ending Howard's  abusive policies  27th May 04 

 Amnesty condemns Australia 

 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle has called on Mark Latham to commit to abolishing the  human rights abusing policies of the Howard government if they win the next  election.   

 "Today's report shows that Australia's human rights record is appalling and getting  worse. The Prime Minister doesn't care about our Human Rights record, but Mark  Latham is an unknown quantity," Senator Nettle said.   

 "The human rights concerns raised by Amnesty stem directly from the policies of the  Howard government.   

 "The Greens are calling on Mark Latham to commit to ending the policies that  Amnesty International have identified as abusing human rights in Australia   

 Polices of concern to Amnesty International  * Mandatory detention of Asylum Seekers - including the Pacific Solution  * Attack on the powers of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission  * ASIO powers to detain non-suspects  * Continuing oppression of Indigenous Australians  * Detention of Australians at Guantanamo Bay  * Occupation of Iraq   

 "Not only are Australian policies criticised but also the policies of  the US which John Howard supports, including the indiscriminate killing of civilians 

 in Iraq and the illegal detention of suspects in  

 Guantanamo Bay, Iraq and Afghanistan.   

 "Australians are committed to a fair go. The policies of the Howard government are  destroying that reputation.   

 "Amnesty International's annual global report is another international voice criticising  the Howard government's policies must not be swept under the carpet by Howard and  his ministers."
