 ORGAN PLEADS CASE OF RUSSIAN ASYLUM SEEKER   

 Cunningham MP Michael Organ has met with Immigration  Minister Philip Ruddock to seek his intervention in the case of  Russian asylum seeker ‘Kristina’ who is threatened with  deportation and faces separation from her 21-month old  Australian-born son as a consequence.   

 “I met with Minister Ruddock in Canberra this week to discuss the  possibility of his direct intervention in this widely-publicised case”,  Mr. Organ said.   

 “I have sought his intervention because the prospect of an infant  being separated from his mother under these circumstances is an  affront to community standards and our obligations under  international law, particularly the Convention on the Rights of the  Child.”   

 “The Minister told me that his legal staff are reviewing papers in  connection with ‘Kristina’s’ case, which he has agreed to further  consider when questions surrounding her identity become clear.”   

 “I am hopeful of a positive outcome from my representations”, Mr.  Organ said
