 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 9 May 2014   

 Australian Border Force is Morrison’s dog  whistle   

 The establishment of Australian Border Force is a deliberate move to cut jobs and further  demonise refugees, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “Australian Border Force is pure Liberal dogma, combing ideological cuts with the demonisation  of refugees. No wonder Scott Morrison couldn’t wait until Tuesday to tell us all about it,” the  Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “This bureaucratic shuffle is all about show. Minister Morrison simply wants to talk about  refugees and criminals in the same sentence, to further blur the line between the two, for cynical  political purposes.   

 “Rather than finding a humanitarian way to work with refugees, the Abbott Government is simply  dog whistling.   

 “It’s all about cutting jobs and demonising refugees.”
