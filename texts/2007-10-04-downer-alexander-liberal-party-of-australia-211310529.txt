 MEDIA RELEASE   MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  ALEXANDER DOWNER    

 Media Release  

 4 October 2007 

 Diplomatic Appointment - Ambassador to East Timor 

 Mr Peter Heyward is to be Australia’s new Ambassador to East Timor. Mr Heyward  will replace Ms Margaret Twomey who has been Ambassador since August 2004 and  is expected to take up his appointment in January 2008. 

 Mr Heyward’s appointment comes at a significant time in East Timor’s development,  following presidential and parliamentary elections earlier this year, and the  inauguration of Prime Minister Gusmao’s new Government on 8 August 2007. 

 As a close neighbour and good friend, Australia will remain at the forefront of  international support to East Timor. At the request of the East Timorese Government,  Australia is currently leading the International Stabilisation Force which supports the  United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) in maintaining security  following the violence of April/May 2006. 

 Australia and East Timor have recently enhanced their cooperation over the Timor  Sea with the entry into force in February 2007 of two new treaties that will enable the  development of substantial resources for the benefit of both countries. 

 Australia’s bilateral development assistance and defence and police cooperation  programs will continue to assist the Government and people of East Timor to build a  secure and prosperous future. Australia will deliver an enhanced package of  development assistance to East Timor, worth an estimated $214 million over the next  four years. Australia’s assistance will focus on the justice sector, economic  development and management, technical and vocational education and the delivery of  basic services (health, water and sanitation) particularly to rural areas. 

 Since July 2005, Mr Heyward has been Australia’s Ambassador to Brazil, Colombia  and Venezuela. Other overseas service has included serving as Counsellor, Australian  Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva (2000-02) and as First Secretary,  later Counsellor, in Buenos Aires (1993-96). In Canberra, Mr Heyward has held a  range of positions including Assistant Secretary, Environment Branch in the 

 Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (2002-04), Director, Human Rights and  Indigenous Issues Section (1998-2000) and Director, Refugees, Immigration and  Asylum Section (1996-98). He has also worked in the Climate Change and  Biodiversity Section (1991-92) and the Antarctic Section (1989-91). 

 Mr Heyward was born in Brighton, UK in 1955, he holds a Bachelor of Arts from the  University of Tasmania and speaks Portuguese and Spanish. Mr Heyward is married  and has two adult children.
