 Malcolm Turnbull and former Prime Minister Bob Hawke welcome  Wentworth's newest citizens 

 Wednesday, 19 July 2006 

 Federal member for Wentworth the Hon  Malcolm Turnbull MP welcomed Wentworth’s  newest Australian citizens tonight at a  ceremony at Woollahra Council also attended  by former Prime Minister Bob Hawke.  

 Addressing a crowd of pledging Australians  and their friends and families Mr Turnbull  offered his warmest congratulations to the  new Australians and thanked them for joining  the Australian family.  

 "Our society is enriched by the diverse  cultures, languages and customs of migrants  and refugees who have come here from all  parts of the globe. The common bond that  unites us all is citizenship,” Mr Turnbull said.  

 ‘As an Australian citizen, you are expected to participate fully in our community, to respect the rule  of law, support parliamentary democracy and to strengthen the freedom and openness which makes  Australia our unique home.”  

 “On behalf of the Australian Government I offer you my warmest congratulations and best wishes  for the years ahead as Aussies.”  

 Mr Turnbull said it was a particular pleasure to preside over the ceremony as guest of Woollahra  Mayor Andrew Petrie, who has recently returned to work after a period of illness, and former Prime  Minister Bob Hawke.  

 Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke described the citizenship ceremony as a joyous occasion and  acknowledged participants as part of a magnificent ongoing cultural programme.  

 “You have helped make us, all of us, new Australians,” he said.  

 Mr Turnbull regularly participates in citizenship ceremonies at Randwick, Waverley and Woollahra  Councils.
