 Government Rejects UN Report on  Arbitrary Detention

 The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer and  the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and  Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock today rejected the  report of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary  Detention's visit to Australia in May and June of this  year.

 The report is a very disappointing effort. It contains  fundamental factual errors, misrepresents Australia's  policies and demonstrates significant confusion about  the relationship between international and Australian  law.

 Australia had submitted a lengthy document detailing  the errors. However, the Working Group indicated that  it did not intend to amend the report, even though it  was aware of the existence of factual errors.

 This brings the credibility of the entire report and its  conclusions into question. It again demonstrates the  fundamental flaws in the UN human rights committee  system.

 Examples of basic factual errors in the report include  claims that detainees are routinely handcuffed when  outside detention centres. Many detainees regularly  leave centres to participate in schooling and outings or  visits to local facilities and they are not handcuffed.

 The Working Group also talks about barbed wire around  the residential housing project at Woomera, when there 



  is no barbed wire. 

  The report also claims that detainees do not have the  ability to challenge ongoing detention before a court.  This is not true. If the detention is not in accordance  with Australian law, the court can, under the Migration  Act, order the release of the person concerned.

  This demonstrates that in our democratic society the  right to judicial review of immigration detention is a  real one. If the Working Group has difficulty with basic facts, it is  hard to take other observations seriously.

  The report is particularly disappointing as it has made  similar errors to the report of Justice Bhagwati, the  personal envoy of the UN High Commissioner for  Human Rights, released earlier this year.The Working  Group's report makes several recommendations relating  to the detention of unauthorised arrivals, skating over  the fact that it is the sovereign right of Australia to  determine who will enter its borders and the  circumstances of that entry. It is common knowledge  that almost all people in immigration detention have  passed through countries in which they could have  sought protection en route to Australia.

  Immigration detention is an essential element  underpinning the integrity of Australia's migration  program and the protection of our borders. Without  immigration detention, it would not be possible to  ensure that we are able to remove people from  Australia if they have no lawful authority to be here. 

  It would also not be possible to ensure that people who  arrive without proper authority are available for health,  security and identity checking.

  The report makes recommendations about the length of  detention. People in immigration detention are under  administrative detention, they are not in prison. They  are generally free to leave detention and return home  at any time.

  The vast majority of unauthorised boat arrivals still in  mainland detention have been found not to be refugees  and are available for removal. A significant number are  not cooperating with those removal efforts and are  prolonging their stay in detention.

  There is no recognition in the report of the role 

  Australia plays every year in the resettlement of  thousands of refugees from vulnerable situations  around the world. Detention plays a major role in  maintaining the integrity of our borders and our ability  to respond to refugee resettlement needs. It is also  important in maintaining public confidence in our  immigration system.

  As a signatory to all of the UN's core human rights  instruments, the Government takes its international  obligations, including its human rights obligations, very  seriously. It does not accept that our system of  immigration detention is inconsistent with our  international obligations. 

  Yet again, a UN human rights body has produced a  report misguidedly critical of Australia at a time when  greater focus on egregious human rights abuses  elsewhere in the world would have been more  appropriate.
