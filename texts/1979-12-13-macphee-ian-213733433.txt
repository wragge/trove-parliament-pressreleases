 month in the Migrant Resources Centre, .George Street,  Parramatta 

 next to the new Commonwealth Bank Building.

 NSW Aduit Migrant Education Service and has been employed with 

 funds provided by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.  

 She will be assisted by a part-time instructor who will brief tutors 

 on how to conduct tutoring sessions.

 The Home Tutor Scheme is part of the Adult Migrant and 

 Refugee Education Program which is co-ordinated and funded 

 nationally by the Department. ._

 about life in Australia which will assist them to settle, and to 

 make use of the Government and other services which are available 

 to the community generally.

 recommendations in the report was that the -Home Tutor Scheme 

 be extended. .

 Scheme Co-ordinating Committee on the detailed arrangements for 

 the Scheme in NSW. The Committee,  chaired by an officer of the 

 Department,  had recommended the appointment of a co-ordinator 

 -  in Parramatta.

 today to mark the appointment of the new co-ordinator.

 promotion of the Scheme in the Parramatta area were invited.

 or who are able to refer Mrs Purvis to anyone needing assistance 

 should telephone 635 6155 or 633 3115.
