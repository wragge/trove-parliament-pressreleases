 PREGNANCY AND BIRTH VIDEO FOR MIGRANT WOMEN

 A colour video about pregnancy and birth in Australia, to  help migrant women who have difficulties in English, is now  available in nine community languages, the Minister for  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Stewart West, announced  today. Three more languages will be available soon.

 The 17-minute video-tape, "Pregnancy and Birth",  was  originally produced by Film Australia with an English  commentary prepared by Dr Derek Llewellyn-Jones, one of  Australia's best known gynaecologists.

 "Having a baby in a usually monolingual Australian hospital  can be a traumatic experience for a number of migrant and  refugee parents," Mr West said. “Watching the film will, in  many cases,  cushion the effect of cultural differences  because it provides a practical demonstration of hospital  procedures and the actions and attitudes of,doctors and 

 other hospital staff.”

 "It recognises that many migrant women having babies may not  have had the opportunity to learn English and that in  matters of crucial importance to people, like the birth of  their child, information is best in their own language."

 The project complements another national program launched in  May 1984, "Language of Childbirth", designed to help child­  bearing women to communicate more effectively with hospital  staff. It was developed by the N.S.W. Adult Migrant 

 Education Service and funded by the Department of  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.

 "Pregnancy and Birth" is a practical and realistic film  which does not forget the father. It shows how he may  share, if he wants to, in the process, both during pregnancy  and at the time of delivery.

 grouping. Cantonese, Khmer and Portuguese will be available  in a few weeks.
