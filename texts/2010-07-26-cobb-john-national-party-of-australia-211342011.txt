 Prime Minister Julia Gillard Climate Change announcement has to be one of the  lamest, half-baked excuses for a policy since ‘medicare-gold’ or ‘noodle nation’,  Member for Calare, John Cobb said.  “Never has a party in election mode been more gutless in avoiding and issue with  enormous implications for Australia,” Mr Cobb said.  “MPs and their leaders are elected and paid to represent and make decisions on  Australia’s behalf.  “There can only be one reason the Government has released such a lame policy and  that is Julia Gillard’s backroom boys have already cut a deal with the Greens to do  whatever it takes to stay in Government.  “Julia Gillard wanted you to believe less than an evolutionary shiver ago Climate  Change; ‘was the greatest moral challenge of our time’ and Australia had to lead the  world by introducing emissions trading scheme (ETS).  “Labor’s Climate Change Policy is weakest policy announcement of the election  campaign to date and will unravel faster than Julia Gillard’s ‘East Timor’ boat people  policy.   

  “Prime Minister Gillard’s announcement of a Climate Change Citizens Assembly is  nothing more than a gimmick to take the focus away from the increased amount  pensioners, families, and businesses will be forced to pay for the basic necessities of  life like electricity, housing and food.   “I do not support introducing a great big new tax on the Citizens of Calare.  “The people of Calare are already struggling with the recent electricity price hikes  brought about because of the Labor Party’s incompetence.  “It is obvious the only reason the Labor Party Members are not dying of  embarrassment is because they know that the deal, Bob Brown and Julia Gillard  stitched up will ensure that Friday’s policy will go the same way of the 2020 Summit  and amount to nought.  Mr Cobb said the Greens/Labor preference deal which will see the Labor Party  preference the Greens in the Senate is bad news for jobs and a Green controlled 

 Senate will increase the cost of living
