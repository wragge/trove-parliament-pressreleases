 Forty-one Community Safety projects funded in latest round of  National Community Crime Prevention Programme

 Forty-one worthy projects will receive almost $5 million in the latest round of grants awarded  under the National Community Crime Prevention Programme (NCCPP), the Minister for  Justice and Customs, Senator Chris Ellison, announced today. 

 “The Australian Government recognises that the most effective way to fight crime is at the  grass roots level and the National Community Crime Prevention Programme enables local  groups, who are best placed to identify issues within their community, to develop solutions  for themselves,” Senator Ellison said. 

 Encouraging broad community-based partnerships is a key component of the NCCPP in  developing a sustainable response to local crime and community safety issues. 

 “In the Community Safety stream of the programme, 41 applications reflect the programme’s  central objective of trialling new and innovative local approaches to crime prevention,”  Senator Ellison said.  

 The Australian Government has committed $64 million to the NCCPP which provides  funding for community based crime prevention projects in three streams: 

 â¢ Community Partnership stream - grant value of up to $500,000  â¢ Community Safety stream - grant value of up to $150,000, and  â¢ Indigenous Community Safety stream - grant value of up to $150,000.   

 The streams include grants awarded under Security Related Infrastructure, for which  additional funding of $6 million was announced by the Prime Minister on 30 September  2005.
