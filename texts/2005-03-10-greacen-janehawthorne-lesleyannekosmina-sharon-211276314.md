 The challenge of retaining overseas-trained  doctors in rural practice in Victoria: a case study  in the globalisation of the medical workforce  Sharon Kosmina, Rural Workforce Agency Victoria, Lesleyanne Hawthorne, Faculty of  Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne, Jane Greacen, Rural  Workforce Agency Victoria 

 INTRODUCTION 

 In recent times a workforce crisis in health care has arisen in the developed world. The  numbers of Australian medical graduates have failed to meet the demand for doctors,  particularly in rural areas. Recruiting doctors from other countries is seen as one solution to  this undersupply.1 

 Australia has become increasingly dependent on temporary and permanent resident overseas-trained doctors (OTDs)i to meet shortages in the rural doctor workforce. 

 Despite the clear initial attraction of rural general practice, problems have emerged in the long-term retention of OTDs in rural areas, particularly for permanent resident overseas-trained  doctors. While willing to move to country Victoria, OTDs and their families are characterised  by a high degree of geographical and employment mobility. These doctors move between  general practice, rural or urban hospital environments, overseas, within Victoria and Australia. 

 Using Victoria as a case study, this paper outlines medical labour market demand, an overview  of the Victoria rural OTD general practitioner workforce, discusses issues that impact on the  retention of OTDs and recommendations that support the retention of OTDs. 

 METHODS 

 This paper draws on Rural Workforce Agency Victoria (RWAV) experience gained in  supporting the recruitment and retention of rural doctors and workforce data collected for  workforce planning purposes and the national Rural General Practice Minimum Dataset. In  particular it draws on two key research studies conducted in Victoria in 2003: 

 â¢ OTD Retention research: RWAV commissioned Assoc Prof Lesleyanne Hawthorne and  Professor Doris Young from the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences,  University of Melbourne and Dr Bob Birrell, Monash University to conduct a study into the  retention of OTDs in rural Victoria. Key findings are presented in the report “The Retention  of Overseas Trained Doctors in General Practice in Regional Victoria”.2 

 The study results were based on survey responses from 84 OTDs and 56 spouses (38 per  cent response rate), in-depth 30 to 90 minute interviews with 37 OTDs and 15 key  informants and analysis of secondary data including Department of Immigration,  Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) arrivals and departure data for 1998-03,  Census data, Australian Medical Council, Occupational English Test and RWAV data.                                                             

 i Overseas-trained doctors are also known as international medical graduates.

 â¢ Monash University OTD Community Integration study was conducted by Dr Gil-Soo  Han and Prof John Humphreys, School of Rural Health, Monash University. This study  involved interviews with 57 OTDs from around Victoria to identify the factors that  influence OTDs community integration and their intention to stay in rural communities. A  range of factors such as personal, professional and family integration and interaction with  the community were considered. The study also identified the main characteristics of those  OTDs who better integrate into rural communities and those who do so to a lesser degree.  This study developed a four level typology of OTDs in relation to the level of integration  into the rural communities.3 

 RESULTS 

 1. Australia is increasingly reliant on OTDs for its workforce supply, in  a competitive global medical market 

 Western developed countries including United Kingdom and Ireland, USA, Canada, New  Zealand and Australia are experiencing substantial medical practitioner workforce shortages  and are attracting OTDs to meet workforce gaps. A British government plan to have 15 000  more GPs and consultants working in the National Health Service by 2008 is likely to fall short  of its target by around 3 000 GPs4. British Government ministers say they will fill the gap with  doctors recruited from overseas6. In Canada and the USA, nearly one-quarter of licensed  physicians are overseas-trained doctors.5 In Canada, it is estimated that by 2011, one hundred  per cent of net growth in professions will depend on migration.2 

 In Australia, GP shortages that were confined to rural and remote areas have extended into  capital cities and the urban fringe as well as a wide range of medical specialities, hospitals and  across the health workforce. 

 Health professions in short supply listed on the national “Migrant Occupations in Demand”  list (September 2004) include general practitioners, anaesthetists, dermatologists, emergency  medicine specialists, obstetricians and gynaecologists, ophthalmologists, paediatricians,  pathologists, specialist physicians, psychiatrists, radiologists, surgeons, nurses, midwives,  physiotherapists; pharmacists, occupational therapists and radiographers.6 These occupations  now earn the highest points for immigration consideration for visa applications to Australia. 

 The Australian Government has recognised these shortages and introduced a range of  initiatives to attract OTDs to work in rural and remote Australia. These include the  introduction of respective “Five Year Schemes” in the States and Northern Territoryii. These  schemes offer a reduction of five years in the 10-year moratoriumiii to overseas GPs with  eligible postgraduate qualifications and experience to work in areas designated as Districts of 

 Workforce Shortage. In 2004, the Australian Government agreed under Medicare reforms to 

 

 ii Victorian OTD Rural Recruitment Scheme aims to attract general practitioners with postgraduate  general practice qualifications or recognised general practice experience to work in rural areas designated  as Districts of Workforce Shortage by the Australian Department of Health and Ageing. Selected doctors  receive a reduction of 5 years in the 10-year moratorium on provider numbers. Doctors who achieve their  Fellowship of the Royal College of General Practitioners can gain permanent residency and can move  anywhere within Australia after five years in the Scheme.  iii In December 1996, the Australian Government introduced the 10-year moratorium on access to  Medicare Provider numbers for GPs. This restricted access to Medicare provider numbers to those who  completed the RACGP Training program, and to permanent resident or temporary resident OTDs to  practice in approved areas-of-need for ten years.

 aim to recruit an additional 725 full-time equivalent general practitioners and medical  specialists by 2007.iv 

 In the last decade, Australia has seen substantial growth in the number of OTDs entering the  country with for example, the proportion of overseas-born medical practitioners working in  Australia rising from 40 per cent in 1991 to 44 per cent in 1996 to 47 per cent in 2001 2 and the  number of temporary entrant OTDs recruited each year in Australia increasing fourfold in a  decade from 664 in 1993-94 to 2656 in 2001-02.7 

 General Practice Education and Training report that in 2004 overseas born doctors represented  69.4 per cent of the 616 GP registrars entering the training program. Overseas-trained doctors  represented 36.4 per cent of the GP registrars entering the training program in 2004, up from  35.1 per cent in 2003.12 

 Analysis of 2001 and 2002 DIMIA migration data on medical practitioners entering and leaving  Australia found that overall in those two years, there had been a net loss of 705 Australian  doctors overseas with a net gain of 2781 medical practitioners from overseas arriving in  Australia, making Australia a net importer of OTD medical migrants. 84 per cent were 

 Temporary Resident Doctors (TRDs) arriving on visas to work in Australia for up to two years  and 16 per cent arrived as permanent residents. 2 

 The largest groups of Temporary Resident Doctors (TRDs) are arriving under two major visa  classes: Occupational Trainees (visa 442), a visa category originally intended to allow OTDs  from third world countries to develop their skills in Australia, then return home and Visa 422  ‘Area of Need’ positions. TRDs entering on 422 visas, gain limited medical registration. These  TRDs are exempted from sitting the Australian Medical Council (AMC) pre-accreditation  examinations and the Occupational English test and require an employer sponsor. Under 2004  Medicare reforms, their visa stay has been extended from a maximum of two years to up to  four years. 

 The number of TRDs arriving on 422 visas varies significantly among the States with  Queensland, Western Australia and Victoria, attracting the largest numbers of TRDs.2 In  Victoria, the vast majority of TRDs are working in Victorian hospitals, with a relatively small  proportion (6 per cent in 2001-02) ending up in rural general practice.5 

 Each year substantial numbers of OTDs also arrive as permanent residents mostly via the  family reunion program or as spouses of other principal applicants. Relatively smaller numbers  also arrive as refugees or on specific skilled migration programs. An important component of  these permanent resident doctors are New Zealand citizens. These doctors have the right to  move to Australia with most of the privileges of permanent residents. Hawthorne et al notes  that a great majority of these New Zealand citizens however are in fact third country migrants.  Of the New Zealand citizen arrivals in 2001 and 2002, only 29 per cent were New Zealand  born.2 

 Hawthorne et al examined OTD success in finding medical employment and found that many  permanent residents have struggled to find work in Australia. For example, 80 per cent or  more of doctors qualified in New Zealand, UK/Ireland and South Africa had found medical  employment within 5 years of arrival whilst only a third of those from Middle Eastern, Eastern  European or non-Commonwealth Asian countries had found medical employment.2 

 

 iv Strengthening Medicare seeks to recruit suitable OTDs to work in areas approved as Districts of  Workforce Shortage across Australia. To be eligible, OTDs must not have worked in Australia in the last  12 months.

 C o n f e r e n c e 

 Key barriers identified were the Occupational English Test (OET) and the two stage Australian  Medical Council examinations that involve a Multiple Choice Questionnaire (MCQ) and a  clinical exam. Hawthorne et al reported that just 35 per cent of all candidates passes the MCQ  on their first attempt between 1978 and 1993, with an additional 39 per cent passing on  successive tries.2 Hawthorne et al concluded that high OET and AMC failure rates has led to  large pool of work-hungry permanent resident OTDs whose only access to medical work is  through conditional employment in areas of need such as rural areas. At the same time, there  have been growing numbers of TRDS able to bypass the OET and AMC exams, a situation  regarded as deeply inequitable by large numbers of OTDs.2 

 A Post-Graduate Medical Council Victoria Study of AMC candidates in the Victorian hospital  system8 found that key issues identified by stakeholders included OTDs’ variability in medical  knowledge, clinical skills and communication skills supporting the need for standardisation of 

 processes for OTDs, particularly at entry into Australia.v 

 Regardless of the pathways to employment, it is clear that there is a growing cohort of overseas  born and overseas-trained medical practitioners at all levels of the medical workforce including  postgraduate GP trainees. 

 2. Characteristics of OTDs working in Victorian rural general practice 

 In Victoria, OTDs have always been an important supply of doctors over many decades for  rural Victorian communities, with many OTDs now long-term well-established Australian  residents. RWAV data indicates that in November 2003, 30 per cent of the 1101 GPs in regional,  rural and remote Victoria gained their basic medical degree outside Australia. These doctors  gained their qualifications from 55 different countries with the major source regions being UK  and Ireland (10.2 per cent), Asiavi (8.4 per cent), Eastern Europe (3.9 per cent) and Africa (3.5  per cent). 

 Whilst earlier periods of migration to Victoria were particularly characterised by UK and Irish  migration, data on the most recent arrivals indicate that the source regions of supply are  changing with a trend to greater Asian migration and a broader diversity of source countries.  RWAV data indicates that of those OTDs who have commenced in Victorian rural general 

 practice since 1998 the major source regions in order of size include Asia, UK and Ireland,  Africa, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. 12 

 Whilst the proportion of OTDs entering Australia in 2001 and 2002 indicate a ratio of about  four TRDs to every one permanent resident, this ratio is reversed in rural Victoria. 

 RWAV recruitment data indicates that for every one Temporary Resident Doctor recruited and  placed from overseas, approximately three Permanent Resident Doctors with conditional  registration are seeking approval to work in rural Victoria under the Rural Locum Relief  Program. 

 Victorian rural practice is therefore a culturally and professionally diverse workforce, with a  significant proportion of doctors working with conditional registration only (69 per cent of the  Hawthorne et al. study). 

 

 v A standard assessment process is currently under consideration by various State Medical Boards and  the Australian Medical Council. The AMC is developing a standard MCQ test, which is proposed to be  available off shore for temporary and permanent resident applicants. 

 vi Asia includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia,  Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam

 RWAV conducts the assessment of OTDs under the Five Year Scheme and for the Rural Locum  Relief Program (RLRP)vii and is an approved recruitment agency under Strengthening  Medicare. Interview panels routinely recommend a range of support for these doctors to assist  in their placement and to support their retention. These include up-skilling in emergency  medicine, additional clinical skills training often including women’s health and cross-cultural  training, orientation to Australian health system and their practices and communities and  family support to assist their integration into communities. For those doctors who do not have  AMC or Fellowship of Royal College of General Practitioners, these doctors also seek  additional assistance to prepare for their examinations, which is a major priority for many  doctors and a requirement of the Five Year Scheme. 

 Consistent with the various program guidelines that target areas of need or districts of  workforce shortage, the proportion of OTDs increases with remoteness. OTDs are 20 per cent  of GPs in regional centres, 32 per cent in large rural centres, 33 per cent in small rural centres 

 and 43 per cent of GPs in remote locations in Victoria.9  

 3. OTDs are characterised by extreme hyper-mobility in search of  better opportunity for themselves and their families 

 A key finding from the OTD retention research was the level of entrenched and global hyper-mobility of OTDs. Sixty-six per cent of all survey respondents reporting five major  geographical moves prior to their current position in Victorian rural general practice  (migrating to one or more countries and then additionally within Australia), with some  reporting up to eight major country or interstate moves involving travel around the world  and/or extensively within Australia.  

 OTDs are coming to Australia for improved lifestyle and opportunities for their children,  although pre-existing family links, security and safety, career opportunity and a chance for  adventure or a sea change were other factors. Career opportunity was the primary reason  OTDs chose Victoria, followed by access to family and friends and the intrinsic attractiveness  of Victoria as a State. Once in Victoria, job related reasons was a prime determinant in selecting  a rural location, although many doctors saw rural locations as their only medical option. 2 

 The moratorium on provider numbers is a strong incentive for OTDs to enter rural general  practice. For many OTDs, Victorian country posts are inevitably no more than an additional  step along the way to doctors’ goals of maximising family lifestyle, income level, and personal  security. 2  

 4. Satisfied OTDs stay longer 

 On average, RWAV data indicates that Victorian rural GPs stay in their current general practice  position for 10 years. However when comparing Australian-trained doctors and overseas-trained doctors, significant differences emerge. Australian-trained doctors remain an average  12.3 years and OTDs remaining 7.1 years. Younger OTDs are clearly more mobile, with  Australian-trained doctors aged under 45 years remaining an average of seven years, with  OTDs aged under 45 years remaining 3.5 years. 14 

 

 vii The Rural Locum Relief Program is a national program that assists permanent resident or Australian  citizens with relevant clinical skills and experience to work in rural general practice. RWAV assesses  applicants and makes recommendations to the Health Insurance Commission on provider numbers for  specific locations under the RLRP. Eligibility is defined by the criteria designated in sections 19AA and  19AB of the Health Insurance Act.

 Hawthorne et al research found that encouragingly 40 per cent were satisfied with the nature  of their GP work and 56 per cent reasonably satisfied, viewing the work as extremely relevant  to their skills, and supported by good access to specialist services. 2.  

 High, medium and low satisfaction factors were identified in the Hawthorne et al. research,  with ‘high satisfaction’ factors being the nature of GP work, relevance of the position to their  medical skills, friendliness of the town, the medical location and access to specialist services2.  

 The ‘reasonably satisfying’ factors involved relationships with colleagues, level of local  professional support, access to other medical resources, the location and size of the town and  range of town facilities2. 

 Importantly ‘low satisfaction’ factors included quality of schools, salary level, access to  partners job, nearness to family and friends and the level of support to help pass exams.2 All of  these factors were also rated extremely high as factors influencing the OTDs decision to remain  in rural general practice2. 

 Significant differences in level of satisfaction were also identified between doctors of region of  origin. Doctors from Asia, Africa and the Middle East proved three times more likely to be only  reasonably satisfied or actively dissatisfied with the nature of their work when compared to  survey respondents from the UK/Ireland or Europe.2 This cohort represents an increasing  proportion of doctors moving into rural Victoria. 

 Whilst most respondents had established positive peer relations (76 per cent) respondents  indicated that the process had often been difficult, with doctors coming from a UK/Ireland,  Asian or European background found to be three times more likely to be satisfied with their  professional colleagues than doctors from the Middle East or Africa.2  

 Four key themes in relation to colleagues’ attitudes repeatedly recurred in the interviews.  These were: 

 â¢ peer wariness or distrust of medical outsiders; 

 â¢ lack of respect for the overseas-trained doctor’s skills, including his/her ability to deal with  a range of cases without vetting; 

 â¢ reluctance of other doctors to refer on an adequate flow of patients; and 

 â¢ unwillingness to allocate the OTD sufficient remuneration. 

 These issues were viewed as particularly difficult to accept given the relative seniority of  Victorian OTDs and their level of qualifications (58 per cent of Hawthorne et al. survey  respondents having 2 medical qualifications, and 34 per cent stating 3-4). 2  

 OTDs had serious concerns about their level of remuneration that in some cases improved over  time, but in other cases, led them to consider leaving practices. OTDs could enter rural practice  with unrealistic expectations of financial reward and the time required to build up patient  demand.  

 OTDs lacking vocational registration and working in regional cities of Bendigo, Ballarat,  Shepparton and Wodonga cannot be paid at vocational registration rates unlike OTDs in other  rural and remote areas. As a result payment per patient is significantly less in these locations.  Consequently, these regional cities have had extreme difficulty in attracting and keeping  doctors. For doctors reaching Australia with minimum financial reserves, start-up costs  represented a serious burden. 2

 5. The importance of community integration to long-term retention 

 Monash University community integration study 4 highlighted the critical importance of  community integration to long-term retention, identifying four typologies of rural community  integration.  

 ‘Integrated’ doctors were highly satisfied with their practice, had cultivated relationships with  the locals and had developed a strong sense of belonging. Of the 57 doctors interviewed in the  Monash study about half fell into this group. Participants who were clearly aware of the  requirement to work in rural communities before they arrived tended to predominate among  the integrated doctors, with better-integrated doctors coming from both rural and urban  backgrounds4  

 ‘Ambivalent’ OTDs were unsure about their future settlement place, but with persuasion might  settle in the rural community for a longer term. These OTDs could easily leave for reasons such  as children’s education, spouse employment or practice viability issues. They were highly  satisfied with their rural practice and life but had considerable reservations about the future. 4 

 ‘Fence sitter’ OTDs lived in the city fringe areas where they could enjoy both urban and rural  practice and lifestyle. They are unable to think of life in a rural community more than 200kms  away from the city. Their proximity to the city gives access to ethnic communities and city  opportunities but they enjoy rural practice and lifestyle.4 

 ‘Satellite operators’ were OTDs who work in rural areas temporarily for the sake of required  training and obtaining qualifications. Their families already live in Melbourne and the doctors  commute to work either daily or weekly. These doctors may be integrated into their rural 

 community, but are destined to head to the city when they can. They can be highly anxious  about how their life and practice will unfold. 4 

 DISCUSSION 

 Recruiting doctors from other countries is a strategy employed by many major western  countries including Australia to meet national workforce shortages and growth in demand for  medical practitioners. There are many doctors in developing and developed countries that are  undertaking strategic moves around the world in an effort to improve lifestyle, career and  family opportunities. The relative attractiveness of Australia means that Australia is currently a  net importer of OTDs.  

 However, OTDs are arriving with a vast range of cultural, professional and medical  experiences, training, qualifications and English language skills. Many are arriving to work in  identified practices on temporary visas and the number of temporary entrants has rapidly  increased over the last decade. Others are arriving as permanent residents, mostly as part of  family reunion programs or as spouses of principle applicants to live long term in Australia.  For many, perhaps the majority, their medical practice experience has been gained in  communities that are significantly different to the Australian medical environment.  

 Each OTD has a unique set of qualifications, experience, training, family circumstances and  pathways to rural general practice in Victoria. However, the data seems to indicate some  discernable differences between groups of OTDs. 

 There are those more typically recruited through schemes such as the Five Year Scheme who  will have postgraduate qualifications or considerable relevant experience. These doctors are in  demand by rural practices. However, TRDs in this category are by definition on limited visas.

 N a t i o n a l  

 Rural Health 

 C o n f e r e n c e 

 For many practices, the hope is that the TRD who fits in well will apply for permanent  residency and stay in that practice long term.  

 Whether the doctor stays or not is dependent on a range of factors that relate to the extent to  which the doctor and family integrate into the community, the level of professional and family  satisfaction with the practice and the community and the availability of options that meet the  families’ needs including children’s schooling and spouse employment options.  

 However, for OTDs who do not have qualifications and experience assessed as equivalent to  Australian standards or who have no or poor English language skills, then the pathways into  medical practice can be characterised by substantial struggle and delays to practice in medicine 

 in Australia. Many permanent resident doctors fall into this group and they can experience  long career gaps, years of study to pass the Occupational English test, Australian Medical  Council exams or postgraduate training to achieve Fellowship of RACGP.2 As permanent  residents these doctors are more likely to have a long-term commitment to remain in Australia.  For many however, rural practice may be their only option, with these OTDs therefore moving  rural with some reluctance and who will move as soon as they are able into the next position  that will advance their career goal of gaining unconditional medical registration.  

 The Victorian evidence also indicates that cultural backgrounds may play an important part in  the integration and long-term retention of OTDs, with the Hawthorne et al. research finding  that OTDs from Asia, Africa and the Middle East are significantly less likely to be satisfied with  rural practice. There is a level of resentment by permanent resident doctors in particular, who  believe that the skills they do have are undervalued or resent the inequities in the system that  enables temporary entrants to bypass processes they are obliged to complete.  

 Rural communities and practices quite rightly seek security that the doctors working in their  communities meet the practice standards required and are able to communicate with patients  and respond to community needs. However, because practices in small rural or remote  communities and in isolated environments have different and specific demands, OTDs placed  in rural and remote areas may require additional skills and appropriate aptitude to meet the  challenges of rural practice.  

 As a result, OTDs working in rural Victoria require significant levels of support to work and  remain in rural practice. Commonly, the support required falls into a number of categories  including: 

 â¢ orientation to the practice, the community and the Australian medical system;  

 â¢ training and upskilling in a substantial range of areas but most commonly emergency  medicine and women’s health. In addition to clinical skills training, OTDs required greater  support for study skills, communication and English language skills and Koori cultural  sensitivity  

 â¢ employment and case management support including contract assistance 

 â¢ an active community program that welcomes the doctor and family and fosters the  integration of the doctor and family where possible into the community; 

 â¢ examination preparation support to achieve their AMC or Fellowship qualifications, which  is a high priority for OTDs; and  

 â¢ ongoing professional support and assistance.

 C o n f e r e n c e 

 Evidence indicates that many OTDs do remain in communities for longer periods of time and  the average for Victorian OTDs is 7 years, which is a significant contribution by any standards.  However, the retention decisions depend on many factors. Critical to the OTD are family  factors such as children’s education and spouse employment, access to a good, well-paid  medical job, orientation, practice and professional support. 

 Whilst communities, practices and agencies such as Rural Workforce Agencies and Divisions of  General Practice actively work to support OTDs at a range of levels, there has been no  systematic funding or structured programs of support that expressly address the broad 

 retention and support needs of OTDs particularly for permanent resident OTDs. Agencies such  as RWAV and the Divisions have done what they can to meet some of these needs such as  orientation support, training grants, specific emergency medicine and other essential training,  linking into exam preparation programs and family support systems where available. Funding 

 is now available for some support for exam preparation. However resources are limited and  there are insufficient funds available to meet the broad retention needs of OTDs.  

 As the global competition for medical resources continues and as opportunities open up for  OTDs in metropolitan areas, across Australia and overseas, it is clear that OTDs are not fearful  of moving in search of better opportunities. If Australia and rural Australia is to remain an  attractive destination, more is required to effectively support the integration of OTDs into rural  communities. A good first step would be greater recognition of the valuable contribution that  OTDs do currently make to the rural medical workforce and will need to make for some  considerable time into the future.  

 RECOMMENDATIONS 

 That the National Rural Health Alliance recommend to respective Australian and State and  Territory Governments and other key stakeholders: 

 Assessment 

 1 That the proposal to develop a common national assessment tool that applies to all  OTDs, permanent and temporary, be supported and that the medical registration  boards give consideration to establishing nationally consistent criteria and processes  for granting area of need registration, to ensure that all OTDs granted area of need  registration have the skills and experience required for rural general practice in  Australia.  

 Orientation 

 2 That permanent and temporary resident OTDs receive access to information and  orientation programs to the Australian Medical System and work in Australia. 

 Placement support 

 3 That realistic professional and personal needs of the employer, the OTD and their  family need to be considered in determining suitable placements. 

 4 That OTDs are provided with realistic advice on prospective incomes and access to  employment and other contract advice and assistance. 

 

  Central to Health: sustaining well-being in remote and rural Australia 10 

 N a t i o n a l  

 Rural Health 

 C o n f e r e n c e 

 5 That individual case management services are funded that support the retention of  OTDs and consider additional family and spouse employment support needs.  

 6 That professional and personal orientation and welcome be provided locally by the  practice and community. Community support networks should be used to help the  OTD and his/her family settle in the community. 

 7 That the OTD is provided with an initial practice grant to support the start up costs  whilst they build up a clientele. 

 Examination preparation support 

 8 That funding assistance for exam preparation and support be available to all OTDs  who require this assistance. 

 Retention support 

 9 That community orientation programs that assist OTDs to integrate with their local  communities are supported.  

 10 That ongoing professional development of OTDs including individual learning plans  that will assist OTDs to develop appropriate medical and clinical, communication and  cultural orientation skills, is supported. 

 11 That experienced rural GPs who are willing and able to supervise OTDs need to be  identified and offered training and financial support to undertake supervision of  OTDs. 

 12 That RWAs are resourced to establish a network of trained GP mentors within their  states/territory who are then provided with funded communication and meeting  opportunities to provide mentoring support to OTDs who require and/or desire it.  

 Removal of inequalities 

 13 That the Australian Government consider access to vocational registration rates  (ROMPS) for specific RRMA 3 regional locations that have demonstrated workforce  shortages and assessed as District of Workforce Shortage.  

 14 That the Australian, state and territory governments be alerted to the fact that those  OTDs on the five-year OTD scheme, with the FRACGP and Permanent Residency (PR)  status could potentially move to any urban or outer urban district of workforce  shortage anywhere in Australia. It would take very few such moves to have a  significant impact on the rural/remote GP workforce, and effort is required to provide  incentives to those doctors to remain in rural locations.
