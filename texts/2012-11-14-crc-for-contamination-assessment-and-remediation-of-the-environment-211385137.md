 CRC for Contamination Assessment and Remediation of the  Environment 

 Call for action on world soil crisis 

 November 14, 2012 - for immediate release 

 A distinguished Australian scientist, the winner of an international soil science 

 prize, has called for Australia to lead a renewed global effort to reverse the 

 alarming degradation and contamination of the world’s food-producing soils. 

 Professor Ravi Naidu, the Managing Director of Australia’s CRC for 

 Contamination Assessment and Remediation of the Environment is this year’s 

 recipient of the International Soil Science Award, presented annually by the Soil 

 Science Society of America (SSSA). 

 “Global estimates of the amount of agricultural and pastoral soil lost each year 

 range from 75 to 100 billion tonnes - that’s over 10 tonnes a year for each person 

 on Earth,” Prof. Naidu says. “Furthermore, a satellite study by the United Nations 

 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) revealed about 1 per cent of the world’s 

 farm land has been lost every year for the past quarter century. 

 “Such rates of degradation are completely unsustainable and risk exhausting the 

 world’s food-producing soils within two to three generations.” 

 Prof. Naidu said soil loss and contamination was a ‘sleeping giant’ among various 

 threats to global food security - and had suffered international neglect for 

 decades. 

 “Millions of tonnes of soil can be lost in minutes in a bad storm or flood event, as 

 we saw only last year in Australia - and as America has just experienced. Yet 

 new soil takes from thousands to millions of years to form.” 

 Professor Naidu said he was delighted at the recent announcement by Prime 

 Minister Julia Gillard of an Australian Working Group on Water, Soil and Food 

 headed by the former Governor-General Major-General Michael Jeffery. 

 “I strongly commend the Government for this forward looking move, which is part 

 of the $700 million ‘sustainable agriculture’ stream in the next phase of the Caring 

 for our Country program. It shows real leadership regarding soils issues in 

 Australia. 

 “Australia’s soils are old, leached and low in organic matter and excessive 

 cultivation can impact what’s called the critical zone - this is the soil lying between 

 the plant and the groundwater table. Once soils in this zone are depleted, it is not 

 possible to replenish them. Also a significant proportion are now affected by 

 salinity. All this is relevant to domestic food security. 

 “However we must also recognise that Australia will not be secure if the world as 

 a whole is food insecure. We are connected to the world, especially to Asia, 

 where soils face major pressures. 

 “The new moves in Australia position us well to show increased global leadership 

 in addressing the world soils crisis, just as we are doing at home. 

 “Australian scientists are already hard at work trying to stabilise soils in various 

 threatened regions - but now can do even more, sooner and more effectively. 

 “There is an opportunity not only for Australia to help its neighbours deal with an 

 seriously intractable problem, but also to generate substantial new export income 

 around smart technologies for overcoming soil, water and environmental 

 problems associated with agriculture.” 

 Prof. Naidu said the FAO’s most recent State of the World’s Land and Water 

 Report (SoLaW) had highlighted that more than half the Earth’s land surface was 

 now degraded - while only 10 per cent of it was improving. 

 “The report clearly stated that ‘Across the world, a series of agricultural production 

 systems are at risk due to a combination of excessive demographic pressure and 

 unsustainable agricultural practices’,” he points out. 

 “While Australia may have a food surplus, we can still be affected by very high 

 global food prices, by refugee floods, and trade and conflict issues which may 

 arise out of the collapse of farming systems in other parts of the world. 

 “If we want to mitigate those risks, both to ourselves, to others and to global 

 stability, we need to apply our high levels of skill and knowledge in managing soils 

 to more international as well as to Australian challenges.” 

 Prof Naidu’s received the SSSA International Soil Science Award for his 

 ‘outstanding contributions to soil science internationally’.
