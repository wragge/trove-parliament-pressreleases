 PRESS STATEMENT BY PHILIP RUDDOCK  OPPOSITION SPOKESMAN FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 "HURFORD MUST COME CLEAN ON AUSTRALIA'S REFUGEE PROGRAM"

 Opposition Spokesman for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Philip Ruddock has called on the Minister, Mr Hurford, . to clarify statements made to selected overseas audiences  on Australia's refugee intake.

 "From statements made in London and now Malaysia it is  unclear where our refugee commitment lies.

 "Mr Hurford should spell o'ut whether the Government intends  to reduce the Indo-Chinese refugee intake as has been hinted  in previous statements.

 "If, as he has indicated already, there will be an increase  of Indo-Chinese leaving under the Orderly Departure Program,  at the expense of the refugee program, the Minister is  having himself on. '

 "Such a policy would be particularly discriminatory, ignoring  the plight of Hmong, Lao and Khmer refugees for whom no  orderly departure program exists.

 "In terms of maintaining the balance within the program  it also fails to recognise the continuing problem with  Thailand where over 120,000 refugees are situated.

 "In making the statements he has, and without the authority  of a Cabinet decision on these matters, Mr Hurford has only  increased the confusion and speculation that already exists.

 "Australian Vietnamese, many of whom have relatives in  refugee camps in Thailand will be anxious to know exactly  what the Government intends.

 "Mr Hurford1s approach from the outset of his overseas foray  has been one of 'hotch potch'  announcements designed to  'warm the hearts' of his overseas audiences.

 "It has done little to restore the confidence of the Australian  public in the Government's desire or ability to consult  with them on Australia's immigration policies. .
