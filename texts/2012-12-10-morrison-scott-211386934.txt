 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Scott Morrison 

 59% Increase in asylum applications as Australia bucks  world trend  10/12/12 

 Recent figures released by the UNHCR show Australia continues to buck the global trend on asylum  applications, under Labor's failed border protection policies, Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today. 

 “Latest data from the UNHCR for asylum applications lodged in 44 industrialised countries shows  there have been 59% more asylum applications in Australia in the first 6 months of this year than in  2011, as Labor's failure on our borders just gets worse,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “And there is more to come, with an average of over 2,000 people arriving by illegal boat every  month since July. In the second half of 2012 overall arrivals are more than double the first half of the  year, with average monthly arrivals up by 130%. 

 “Compared with Australia's huge increase, Canada experienced a fall in applications in the first half  of this year of 8% while in the United Kingdom applications remained steady. 

 “Applications in industrialised nations remained steady overall. 

 “Once again Australia stands out, particularly compared to countries like the UK and Canada with the  most similar case loads of asylum seekers, as experiencing a huge increase in applications under  Labor’s border failures. 

 “These latest figures confirm that the Labor Government's failed border protection policies are the  pull factor on our borders and that the chaos on our borders is just getting worse. 

 “Australia's status as a magnet for people smugglers is clear. People smugglers know Labor is a soft  touch and their half hearted policies and resolve are no deterrent,” Mr Morrison said.
