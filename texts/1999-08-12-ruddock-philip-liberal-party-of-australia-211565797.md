  The Hon Philip Ruddock, MP

  Minister for Immigration and 
Multicultural Affairs

  

  MPS 117/99

  Minister 
Announces Outcome of   
1998-99 Humanitarian Program

  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, 
Philip Ruddock, today announced the 1998-99 Humanitarian Program outcome, 
and provided details of the composition of the 12,000 places allocated 
under the 1999-2000 Humanitarian Program for refugees and displaced 
people. 

  "In 1998-99, some 11,360 humanitarian places 
were granted, including 9,526 offshore and 1,834 in Australia," 
Mr Ruddock said. 

  The conflict in the Balkans necessitated the transfer 
of DIMA staff from Belgrade to Budapest. Mr Ruddock said that this disrupted 
processing of applications under the Humanitarian Program and prevented 
the full 12,000 places being used. 

  "As a result of the conflict in Kosovo, the 
Humanitarian Program provided priority processing for a number of Kosovars 
with close family links to Australia. 

  "The 1998-99 program has been successful in 
delivering an effective and well-targeted program to resettle those 
most in need, reflecting the Government's commitment to assisting bona 
fide refugees," the Minister said. 

  "In addition, because the humanitarian program 
for 1998-99 was set at 12,000 places, the 640 places that were not used 
during the year will be available to meet emerging needs in 1999-2000." 

  Mr Ruddock said that rolling over the unused places 
into the next program year would provide greater flexibility in managing 
program places, enabling the Government to respond effectively to any 
unexpected humanitarian crises. 

  "The Government also wants to ensure that all 
places are fully utilised. In 1997-98, 201 visas were issued to people 
who subsequently did not arrive in Australia. These unused places will 
also be rolled into the 1999-2000 program," Mr Ruddock said. 

  The 1999-2000 program includes: 

  4,000 places for refugees offshore of which approximately 
420 places are for women at risk; 

  a notional 2,000 places for people found to be refugees 
in Australia; 

  4,300 Special Humanitarian Program (SHP) places for 
people found to be experiencing substantial discrimination amounting 
to gross violation of human rights; 

  900 Special Assistance Category (SAC) places; 

  800 places which have not been allocated; and 

  841 places which were not used in previous years. 

  "We are working closely with the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to ensure the program remains 
targeted to those in greatest need of resettlement," Mr Ruddock 
said. 

  The Minister said that as in 1998-99, the former 
Yugoslavia is expected to comprise the largest regional component of 
the program followed by the Middle East and Africa.
