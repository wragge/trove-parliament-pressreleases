 Refugee Arrivals for September  

 5 October 2006 

 During the past month Australia has welcomed 1315 refugee and humanitarian entrants, who  are among those most in need of resettlement, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural  Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone said today.  

 The refugee and humanitarian entrants who arrived in August settled across Australia as  follows:  

 "Of these arrivals, 673 were refugees, many of whom have been waiting in refugee camps for  years," Senator Vanstone said.  

 Refugees are people who are outside their country of nationality and are unable to return  because they fear persecution. These people have been determined to be refugees by the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and assessed to be in need of  resettlement.  

 The remaining 642 people were Special Humanitarian Program (SHP) entrants. They were  forced to leave their home country after being subject to substantial discrimination. They also  have family or other links with Australia.  

 Included in the 1315 arrivals were 682 people from Africa, 521 people from the Middle East and  South West Asia, and 75 people from South East Asia. Senator Vanstone reported that 42  family groups within the August arrivals (a total of 167 people), were granted visas under a  dedicated programme for women at risk.  

 "These are women and their dependants who have lost male family members and are therefore  particularly vulnerable," Senator Vanstone said.  

 "All the August arrivals entered Australia under the refugee and humanitarian programme  which provides 13 000 places each year.
