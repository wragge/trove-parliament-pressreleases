 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling BORDER PROTECTION COMMAND UNDER  MORE PRESSURE AS ANOTHER BOAT  ARRIVES May 25, 2013

 Border Protection Command are continuing to struggle with the constant influx of illegal boat arrivals, as yet another boat  carrying 101 people was intercepted yesterday, Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Shadow  Minister for Justice Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “Already this financial year we have had 347 boats - more than triple the amount of boats that arrived in the previous  financial year,” Mr Keenan said.

 “Despite being the frontline agency that is left to deal with these record breaking numbers of illegal boat arrivals, Labor  continues to take an axe to Customs funding and personnel - having cut $125.5 million and 870 staff from Customs since  coming to office.  

 “It is typical of this Government’s incompetence to expect that a frontline agency, who is trying to cope with the largest  influx of illegal boat arrivals ever on record, can do their job effectively with less funding and less personnel.

 “As a result of Labor’s mismanagement we have seen boats arriving on the mainland undetected, people escaping from  detention centres and an Egyptian terrorist being held in a low level security detention centre, despite being the subject of  an Interpol red notice - all of which occurred in just the last few months under Labor’s watch.

 “Labor cannot be trusted on border protection and they cannot be trusted to put an end to the people smuggling trade.

 “The Coalition has a plan to stop the boats - we have done it before and we will do it again,” Mr Keenan said.
