 Andrews goes back to Tampa with Sri Lankan  refugee decision

 Andrews goes back to Tampa with Sri Lankan refugee decision 

 

 12.09.07 

 

 The Immigration Department’s decision to grant asylum to 72 out of 83 

 refugees but refuse them settlement in Australia is a disgrace equal to the 

 Tampa affair, the Greens spokesperson for Immigration Senator Kerry Nettle 

 said today.  

 

 “This decision to grant refugee status to these people but refuse them 

 settlement on the Australian mainland is Tampa without the ship”, Senator 

 Nettle said.  

 

 “Either Australia accepts its international obligations or it doesn’t.  Asylum 

 seekers must be able to live here if they are found to be refugees.  

 

 "The Government’s 'Pacific Solution' is an international embarrassment that 

 must be relegated to the dustbin of history along with the Howard 

 Government.   

 

 “What part of the word “refugee” doesn’t Minister Andrews understand? 

 

 “The Howard Government should not leave these refugees in limbo like it has 

 with so many refugees before. 

 

 "Kevin Andrews must begin to take Australia’s international obligations 

 seriously by quitting his election driven agenda," Senator Nettle said.
