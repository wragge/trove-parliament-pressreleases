 Australia’s a better place because of refugees: Greens 

 The Australian Greens have today celebrated World Refugee Day, which also marks 60  years since the creation of the United Nations’ refugee agency UNHCR. 

 “I attended a rally in Sydney yesterday along with hundreds of other everyday Australians of  all ages and backgrounds who support refugees,” Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Sen.  Sarah Hanson-Young, said. 

 “Australia’s a better place because of the more than 750,000 refugees who have settled here  since 1901.  

 “From businessman Frank Lowy, who has changed the face of retailing in Australia, to  comedian Anh Do, whose best-selling memoir which makes you grateful for one’s family,  refugees have helped improve this great country. 

 “But I also remember back 10 years ago, when I was a speaker at similar rallies against the  former Howard government’s detention of children. 

 “Back then, we all called on the government to stop condemning vulnerable people to a  lifetime of misery, simply because they had done what any family would do in search of  protection. 

 “If you are fleeing for your life, you continue to run until you feel safe, and that’s what people  have done for centuries, for thousands of years. 

 “Australia was one of the leading countries which pushed for a refugee convention and some  of our parliamentarians helped draft the document. 

 “Sixty years on, it should be Australia that’s holding its head high and saying ‘we set the  world standard’. But unfortunately it’s not the case and children are once again in detention,  having been freed before the Rudd government took office. 

 “The Australian Greens will continue to lobby the Gillard government to drop its Malaysian  people swap deal which is an expensive option and violates our international obligations and  respect for human rights. 

 “We also will continue agitating for all sides to back our bill before the Senate to amend the  Migration Act so all MPs and Senators can have a vote on expelling asylum seekers to any  third country, not just Malaysia.”
