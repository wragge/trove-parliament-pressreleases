 Gary Hardgrave MP   Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs 

   Media Release H46/2002 - 14 May 2002

  

 Government Committed to Refugee Settlement Services

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, today announced continued funding for a range of settlement services for refugee and humanitarian entrants.

 “I am pleased to announce that the 2002 Budget includes ongoing funding of $5.2 million a year from 2003-04 for the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS).

 “Our research shows that this scheme is one of the best in the world in providing essential services to allow humanitarian entrants to adapt to life in Australia.

 IHSS combines seven critical services:

 Accommodation Support; â ï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Information and Orientation Assistance; â ï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Household Formation Support; â ï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Early Health Assessment and Intervention Services; â ï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Support to Proposers of Humanitarian Entrants; â ï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Community Support for Refugees; â ï¿»ï¿»ï¿» Service Provider Support. â ï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 “The beneficiaries of continued funding of the IHSS at the current level are permanent refugee and humanitarian entrants and local communities across Australia,” Mr Hardgrave said.

 The Budget also provides for a continuation of increased funding ($4.5 million a year in 2003-04) for the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) enabling the continuation of the Special Preparatory Program and the Home Tutor Scheme Enhancement Program.

 “The Special Preparatory Program allows for up to 100 hours of additional tuition on top of the AMEP entitlement for people with special learning needs as a result of their pre-migration experience, such as torture and trauma survivors,” Mr Hardgrave said.

 “This worthwhile program gives a particularly disadvantaged group a chance to fit into Australian society, and I am delighted to be able to announce its continuance.

 “Without these services, these special needs groups would be less able and less likely to fully participate in the Australian community,” Mr Hardgrave said.
