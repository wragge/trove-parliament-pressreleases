 PRESS RELEASE ALAN CABMAN M.P.   SHADOW MINISTER FOR   IMMIGRATION &  ETHNIC   AFFAIRS

 BABIY SHOULD NOT BE SENT BACK

 "Mr Aleksandr Babiy should be given all the proper attention  he deserves· in resolving his application to enter  Australia", Alan Cadman, Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Ethnic Affairs said today.

 "There are processes already established for the special  humanitarian consideration of his claims to come to  Australia. '

 "Australia should not be party to his return to the  Soviet Union if he is a man of good character.

 "This is another case of the Department of Foreign Affairs  stalling a claim by defectors from Soviet influence. The  first case was the Vietnamese students who are currently  seeking refugee status in Australia.

 "The criteria to be used by the United Nations may not be  sufficient to protect Mr Babiy on refugee grounds.

 "If the United Nations criteria will not protect him and he  is of good character, Australia should ensure that he is  protected, either by allowing him to come here or by  arranging for his entry into another democratic country".
