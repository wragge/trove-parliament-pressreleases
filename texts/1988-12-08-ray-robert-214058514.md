 NEW SYSTEM OF REV r e v :  ici si o ns

 The Government will introduce a new statutory two-tiered  system of review for rejected immigration applications.

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, said the new statutory review  system was one of the major elements of the Government's  reform of immigration.

 The Minister said the first tier would involve statutory,  and independent review by a special unit in his Department.   The second tier would be review by a revamped Immigration  Review Panel. This new. body will be set up.under the  Migration Act.

 "This change should ensure the appeals process is open,  accountable and fair", Senator Ray said.

 "The special Departmental unit to undertake the first tier  review will operate independently of the departmental  officers who make the primary decisions. It will not be  subject to direction as to how it should handle individual  cases.

 "Internal review is a quick, equitable and efficient way to  correct errors and will give weight to any change of  circumstance which may have occurred since the primary  decision was taken", Senator Ray said.

 The restructured body providing second tier review will be  an independent body. It will be empowered by legislation to  consider cases on their merits and to take determinative  decisions.

 "The body's procedures will be simple and informal, ensuring  easy access by applicants", Senator Ray said.

 Informality will not, however, be at the expense of  professionalism. "Its members will be people whose  background and credentials ensure the highest quality of  decision-making", the Minister said.

 He said the existing Immigration Review Panel system would  be phased-out as the new statutory system was phased-in.

 A  fee would be charged for first tier review and another,  higher fee, would be charged for second tier review.

 Several classes of decision would not be subject to review  under the new system: .notably those relating to the  deportation of 'criminals’,.· those relating to security  matters and those re 1 a,ting'’  to, ref pgee determinations .

 Cases involving' -thesev.i-ssues would be reviewable by the  Minister, or s p e c i a l l - s t ^ ' a g e n c i e s ·

 "The Government can change policy and regulations if a  review body interprets existing guidelines in a new or  undesirable way.

 "Refugee decisions however, are based on internationally-  accepted guidelines which cannot be altered by the  Australian Government. -

 "Only the body responsible for refugee decisions should be  allowed to interpret those guidelines on behalf of the  Government," the Minister said.

 Senator Ray said that once a decision had been taken and  then reviewed, a person would not be allowed to make another  application for a decision for 12 months.

 The only exceptions would be where there had been a  significant change of circumstances, such as marriage to an  Australian resident. .
