 Australian Greens Press Release   

 Wednesday, 17 October 2012   

 Legislation needed to legitimise ASIO reviews   

 Parliament needs to change the law to ensure that a recently announced independent review  function for refugees with adverse security assessments achieves its aims, the Australian Greens  said.   

 “Today I have written to the Attorney General’s office offering the Greens’ assistance in passing  legislation that would enshrine the independent review process for refugees with adverse ASIO  assessments in law” Australian Greens spokesperson for immigration, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “If the Government is serious about closing the legal black hole that has consumed 62 refugees,  including innocent children, they will take up this offer and make the review process a part of  Australian law.   

 “We are pleased that the Government has taken the first step in listening to the experts, the  High Court and the Australian Greens, but a first step by itself is not enough.   

 “A change in law is needed to show that the review process is legitimate and will stand the test  of time to ensure that a fairer process exists to protect vulnerable refugees in the future.”   

 “The Greens look forward to seeing a bill and working with the government to further develop  aspects of these important reforms.
