 Victoria a Popular Home for Arrivals

 Australia continues to appeal as a place to live, with the largest number of migrants and refugee entrants under this Coalition Government settling  Down Under in 2004-05.

 People arrived from more than 200 countries, with the largest influx coming from the United Kingdom. A total of 18 220 now call Australia home -  maybe keen to be part of a successful sporting nation!

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, released the 2004-05 figures today, showing more  than 123 000 people arriving and settling in Australia.

 Senator Vanstone said this was an increase of more than 11 000 on the previous year’s total of 111 590.

 ‘This increase is in line with a general upwards trend over the past decade - in 1994-95, just 87 000 settlers arrived, which means in the past 10  years Australia’s annual number of arrivals has increased by about 40 per cent,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘Australia has a wonderfully rich and diverse society as a result, with nearly one in four of Australia’s 20 million people born overseas.’

 ‘On top of these figures are the growing numbers of people becoming permanent residents after arriving in Australia, such as overseas students  who apply for skilled migration onshore.

 ‘Our ongoing commitment to new and innovative visa programs and the increased efficiency and integrity of immigration processing means that  Australia continues to attract more and more people from around the globe.’
