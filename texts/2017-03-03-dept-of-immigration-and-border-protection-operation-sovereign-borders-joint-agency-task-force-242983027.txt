 03-03-2017 -



 This statement provides an update on Operation Sovereign Borders (OSB) activities related to the on-water



 reception and processing of illegal maritime arrivals.



 The reporting period is from 1 February 2017 to 28 February 2017.



 During this reporting period there were no illegal maritime arrivals transferred to Australian Immigration authorities.



 No illegal maritime arrivals were transferred to regional processing centres (RPCs).



 Seven illegal maritime arrival detainees were voluntarily removed from Australia. Two illegal maritime arrival



 detainees were involuntarily removed from Australia to their country of origin. Their removal from Australia is



 consistent with Australia's obligations.



 Ten illegal maritime arrival transferees voluntarily returned to their country of origin from a regional processing



 country.



 As at 28 February 2017, there were a total of 837 people in Manus RPC and 378 people in Nauru RPC. With the



 opening of the Manus RPC, those yet to be determined are now permitted to depart the RPC. The figure on those



 still living in the RPC will therefore be fluid.



 Of the 1015 Refugee Status Initial Assessment Notifications at Manus Island, 510 were positive and 505 were



 negative as at 28 February 2017. There were 707 refugees who have been given a positive final determination.



 There were 224 failed asylum seekers who have been given a negative final determination.



 Of the 1209 Refugee Status Determination (RSD) hand downs in Nauru, 1019 were positive and 190 were negative



 as at 28 February 2017.
