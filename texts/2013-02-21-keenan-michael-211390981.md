 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling MORE REMINDERS OF BORDER RISKS AS  TWO MORE BOATS ARRIVE February 21, 2013

 The capsizing of an illegal boat and the tragedy that occurred off the coast of Sri Lanka are further reminders of what can occur  without  strong  border  protection  policies  to  deter  illegal  boat  arrivals,  Shadow  Minister  for  Immigration  and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “Too often we continue to see incidents such as these that result in tragic events. No one, not in the Australian Parliament or the community wants to see these tragedies occurring at sea,” Mr Morrison said.

 “Unfortunately these types of tragedies involving people trying to come to Australia illegally by boat have been occurring for years now.

 “The Coalition has constantly argued for the reinstatement of proven policy measures that worked to deter people from making these unsafe voyages.

 “No amount of finger pointing from the government will see these policies restored,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “Two more illegal boats intercepted as the latest surge in arrivals continues to grow in momentum.

 “The boat arrival, which capsized as people were being transferred from the unseaworthy vessel to the HMAS Parramatta,  is a reminder of the dangers facing both the people making this treacherous journey and the men and women of our  Border Protection Command.

 “This comes as reports of up to 100 people died whilst attempting to travel by boat from Burma to Australia - these recent  events are a timely reminder of the terrible tragedies that have occurred whilst the people smugglers are controlling our  borders.

 “It is important that we put an end to this insidious trade that has cost so many people their lives.

 “Labor continues to take the path of least resistance when trying to tackle people smuggling and in turn have failed to stop  the boats from coming.

 “The Coalition will always prioritise protecting our borders - we have the stopped the boats before and will we do it again,”  Mr Keenan said.
