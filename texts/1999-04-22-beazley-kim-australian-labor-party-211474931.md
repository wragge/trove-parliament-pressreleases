  LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

  

  TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, OIL AND 
GAS CONFERENCE,

  SHERATON HOTEL, PERTH,

  22 APRIL 1999

  

  E &   OE - PROOF ONLY

  

  Subjects:   GST, CARE Workers, Business Tax, East Timor

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

  Mr Beazley, can I ask you about Mal Colston, in particular. 
He's questioning if you really genuinely want to defeat the GIST, when 
you won't even meet him to talk about it.

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

  He wants to deal himself in and that's the basis 
of his argument. His proposition is quite immature. He has an obligation 
and he knows it. His obligation is to vote with the Labor Party on this 
Issue. He was endorsed as a Labor Senator and won. He is not like Brian 
Harradine. Brian Harradine won as an independent. Mal Colston knows 
his duty, he knows his duty to the people of Queensland, and that is 
to vote the way he was elected. He was elected as a Labor Party member, 
and he should vote with us.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

  What about Brian Harradine? It sounds as though if 
he gets some of his concessions, he is prepared to back down.

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

  Well, Brian Harradine is going to have an awful lot 
on his plate, over the course of the next couple months. But behind 
his thinking will need to be, and I'm sure it will be, consideration 
that what is happening here is a major tax shift onto families and low 
income earners, and no amount of compensation will make up for the long-term 
effects of that. There is nothing he can do with that, except the most 
minor piece of short-term amelioration. It is a job destroyer in his 
home state and in Queensland, in particular, and I hope very much he 
will take his concerns through to comprehension of that, and defeat 
of the legislation.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

  It sounds as though if he gets the compensation he 
is asking for, he estimates around $l billion, that he is prepared to 
deal.

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

  Well he might. Democrats might deal, anyone might 
deal. What we are doing is keeping alive the option of not doing the 
GST. We are not going to go down the road of supporting amendments or 
propositions which merely change the dynamic of the debate, so that 
we are then talking about some form of the GST. We want to keep the 
option alive of not doing the GST, and we just hope that others will 
support us. But we fully recognise that we have only got 28 out of 76 
votes in the Senate, and that is nowhere near a majority.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

  Moving to Yugoslavia quickly. What chance do you 
think Malcolm Fraser has of successfully bringing these two CARE workers 
back?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

  Well, I thank him for doing it, I thank him for, 
trying his level best. He clearly takes very seriously the great responsibilities 
he has with that organisation, and he has a deal of courage and forthrightness. 
And if anyone is going to have success in securing the release of those 
two CARE workers, I guess he has got the best chance. We will just have 
to wait and see.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

  Now that it looks like we are not taking the 4,000 
refugees, should we be directing more aid money over there, to refugee 
agencies on the ground?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

  We should certainly be doing that. We should also 
be looking slightly more to the long term now and begin to shift the 
emphasis away from the prospect of aiding some short term refugees to 
some long term ones. No matter what the outcome, and the outcome seems 
to be far from clear at the moment, we are going to have a situation 
created where there are going to be some who will feel in deadly strife 
if they have to stay in the area. And I think we must give generously 
out of our own normal refugee program in association with their needs.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

  Mr Beazley, tax reform. This is the second Oil and 
Gas Conference we have had held in Perth this week ... it seems to be 
constant. There are a lot of concerns about trading off accelerated 
depreciation for a 30 per cent corporate tax rate. How do you feel about 
it?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

  The desire for accelerated depreciation arrangements, 
as they now exist expands exponentially the further you get away from 
the golden triangle. And the further you get away from the Sydney - Melbourne 
- Canberra triangle, the more critical the accelerated depreciation appears. 
I don't think that the mining, oil and gas industries have made anywhere 
near sufficient impact on the thinking of Mr Ralph in this regard. What 
this -Government has locked into is a bogus exercise in machismo. Mr 
Costello must have his 30 cent rate. He doesn't give a dam about what 
might happen to investment and research and development in this country 
while he gets it.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

  Do you have a view, though, one way or another?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

  We would have a leaning in that direction. We have 
got an open mind and we are talking to people about it. But it seems 
as though the mind, as far as accelerated depreciation, has now closed. 
And it may be closing in the area of research and development, and investment 
incentives in reality. Now, these are two critical areas from our point 
of view and we think that the committee needs to understand the impact 
of this on some really huge projects. It is one thing to have accelerated 
depreciation in talking about investment of a few million dollars but, 
when you are in the area of billions, it can be absolutely critical.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

  Mr Beazley, do you think the removal of accelerated 
depreciation would be a big mistake, along the same lines of the removal 
of negative gearing was in the late'80s?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

  We removed accelerated depreciation once for a lower 
company tax rate. That’s why we are particularly mindful of the possibilities 
here. It lasted about 18 months before the oil and gas and mineral industry 
were hotfooting it into our various offices, saying there will be absolutely 
no development with this unless we changed our minds. When we sat down 
and did the numbers, it appeared pretty evident that they were right, 
so we had to change it. That's why an ego driven 30 cent tax rate is 
not the way to be sitting down looking at business tax reform.

  

  JOURNALIST: 

  

  So, negative gearing was a mistake, removing it?.

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

  Yes, removal of negative gearing was a mistake, but 
we also did accelerated depreciation and we thought, subsequently, that 
to be a mistake also. So, we have learnt a bit, you know. You get a 
bit scarred and you get a bit wary of these things. So we are a bit 
wary of these suggestions and we have already seen the effect of the 
Governments nail of R&D tax concessions - 20 years of solid growth 
in research and development in the private sector has collapsed. And 
that is just moving it down from 150 to 125. You ought to be a bit wary 
about the manipulation in these areas, when you are having effects like 
that. If we had an equivalent effect in the oil and gas industries and 
in the mining industries, from accelerated depreciation, then the fat 
would be in the fire in our balance of payments very quickly.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

  The industry is probably not making enough noise, 
though, would you agree, Mr Beazley? I mean, it seems to me that the 
bankers in say Melbourne have the Treasurer's ear, but the industry, 
mining, oil and gas industry, should be making a lot more noise than 
what they are.

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

  Yes, I think they should. We only hear the odd foray. 
The Mining Council did say something yesterday, that had been preceded 
by a lot of speculation that, in fact, they were going to tap the mat 
on accelerated depreciation. I don't think that they quite have in focus 
the fact that there is a Major business tax change process going on 
at the moment, and they certainly do need to make themselves heard. 
They are not industries that impact - they ought to, more than they do 
- but they don't necessarily impact very heavily on people in Canberra, 
and they often have to shout twice as loud as everybody else to get 
a hearing.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

  But the impact obviously is ... accelerated depreciation 
will be significant.

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

  It will punch big holes in our balance of payments 
in the long term, there is no doubt about that. These are our big earners. 
It would flatten Western Australian companies, absolutely flatten them. 
Our economy survives here, in Western Australia, on a nine to one balance, 
in our favour, on the external account. Almost all of that is bound 
up in the mining, oil and gas industries. So, you start slowing development 
in that, and you can kiss goodbye the long term prosperity in Western 
Australia.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

  Mr Beazley, are you satisfied with what the Australian 
Government is doing in regard to East Timor?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  I haven't been satisfied with what they have been 
doing to this point. They have been given an opportunity, now, to have 
some influence again. John Howard has been more wishy-washy on the future, 
in the past, than President Habibie has. Now, President Habibie is obviously 
out there calling for some help. He has obviously got a massive internal 
debate on his hands and it is not necessarily the case that all are 
in agreement with him, inside Indonesia. What we need is massive - continuing, 
day in day out - diplomacy by the Australian Government to help weigh 
in the balance in favour of those who want peace in the Territory and 
a decent clear cut form of self determination. So, what John Howard 
needs to bear in mind is that he has to be. governed in his thinking 
by ends, and to be flexible on means, and be involved in the means. 
The ends should be peace in the Territory, no loss of life and an honest 
open act of self determination, with Australia one hundred per cent 
committed to anything that needs to be done, to create that set of circumstances.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

  When you say anything, what about troops?

  

  BEAZLEY:

  

  Well, I don't think that is actually necessary, but 
a firm UN presence on the ground certainly is. So that is going to be 
important to get them involved. The disarming of these militia forces 
is something that has to be done in the here and now, and you could 
never get a peacekeeping force here in time to do that. It has to be 
done by the Indonesian military and the Indonesian military has to get 
ownership of this, if that is at all possible. But, in the long term, 
as the Labor Party has said repeatedly, we don't rule out Australian 
troops as being part of a peacekeeping operation at all.
