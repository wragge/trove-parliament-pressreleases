 Australia’s asylum seeker policies condemned at United Nations    

 The Australian Government has once again been condemned by the United Nations Human  Rights Council for their asylum seeker policies and treatment of refugees.     

 “The Abbott Government is trashing Australia’s international reputation by burden shifting rather  than burden sharing,” Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “The cruel policies adopted by this Government go against advice from human rights bodies  around the world.   

 “The Prime Minister can’t continue to snub his nose at the United Nations.    

 “Tony Abbott has destroyed our relationship with Indonesia, and now he and his colleagues are  embarrassing us internationally.    

 “We are sending people back to warzones in Iraq, we are deporting them to the camps of horror  on Manus Island and Nauru, and we are sending homosexual asylum seekers to countries  where their sexual orientation is a crime that is punishable by death.    

 “This is a clear case of refoulment and the Abbott Government can no longer turn a blind eye.    

 “We cannot continue to breach international law and expect other countries to take us seriously  as human rights advocates.    

 “What’s even more shocking is that Australia is campaigning for membership with the Human  Rights Council in 2018.    

 “If Australia seriously wants to become a member of the Council, the Abbott Government needs  to stop violating human rights for political gain.    

 “Australia needs to step up and help carry its fair share of the burden of the global refugee  crisis.”
