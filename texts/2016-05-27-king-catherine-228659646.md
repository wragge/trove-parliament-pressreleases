 AMA NATIONAL CONFERENCE   

 NATIONAL CONVENTION CENTRE, CANBERRA   

 FRIDAY 27 MAY 2016   

 

 

 Acknowledgements   

 ï· Let me begin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the lands on which we gather. I pay my  respects to their elders both past and present.  ï· Can I thank Brian Owler for his tireless work as AMA President. Brian, I think it’s fair to say it’s been a  tumultuous tenure, beginning with the 2014 Budget. We have not always agreed on every issue. But you 

 have always been an effective advocate for the AMA, its members and the millions of Australians you serve.  Thank you.  ï· Stephen or Michael will have big shoes to fill. Of course, Labor looks forward to working with whoever is  elected to lead the AMA - as we always have.  ï· Finally, let me acknowledge my parliamentary colleague Richard Di Natale.  At the start I want to acknowledge an issue Brian has been particularly determined to raise and rightly so: the health  of asylum seekers and refugees in processing facilities on Manus Island and Nauru. Like the AMA, Labor has been  concerned about the transparency of the healthcare that is provided in these facilities.   

 This week, our Shadow Immigration Minister Richard Marles and I have written to Brian to outline the steps that a  Shorten Labor Government would take on this issue. That letter will be released publicly - but in short, we would  maintain the role of Chief Medical Officer or Surgeon General ABF. We would re-establish an independent medical  panel to advise the CMO and we would seek to ensure proper access for and reporting by those bodies. These steps  should ensure best practice medical care on Manus Island and Nauru and I thank Brian for his advocacy.   

 2016 election    

 This is my third AMA National Conference as Shadow Minister for Health. I am of course hoping to be at your next  one in a different capacity.    

 When you were planning this one, you could not have expected that it would land in the middle of a very competitive  election campaign.   

 But here we are - 19 days down, 36 to go.   

 Of course, health is very much on the agenda in this campaign as it should be. Voters rate it as the most important  issue - above the economy, above the cost of living and above national security.   

 That reflects the fact that health and healthcare are fundamental to our capacity to participate in the social and  economic life of this nation.   

 But I think it also reflects the huge gulf between the parties on health and in particular, on Medicare.   Australians  have watched the debate throughout this term of Parliament, and they know that a lot is at stake on July 2.   

 I don’t want to today go through in detail the litany of what I think have been the most egregious of the harms the  Government has done and tried to do to our healthcare system.  You know them well:   

 ï· The abandonment of literally any role for the Commonwealth in prevention.  ï· The undermining of primary care through multiple attempts at a GP tax and hikes to prescription medicines.  ï· Abandonment of public hospital reform and then belated attempts to try and claim - by putting a fraction of  the funding back in - this somehow amounts to reform. 

 ï· Cuts to not-for-profit agencies.  ï· Cuts to dental.  ï· The undermining of affordable access to pathology and diagnostic imaging and  ï· moves to privatise the Medicare payments system. And even yesterday the disclosure that the 

 Government’s contract for the new national cancer registry, something widely supported, but that contains  highly sensitive data such as pap smear and bowel cancer screening results has gone to Telstra.  It is quite a list.   

 Of all of these I think the most fundamental has been the failure of the now Government when in Opposition to  articulate its vision for health and our healthcare system, to lay out a pathway for healthcare reform and then to  actually enact that in Government.   

 Labor’s health policy   

 At last year’s conference I laid down the building blocks of Labor’s vision to ensure that all Australians have the best  healthcare and health possible.  It included:   

 ï· a enhanced national role for the Commonwealth in preventions;  ï· strengthening primary care, particularly in general practice settings but also between primary care, sub- acute, acute and residential aged care;  ï· better integrating our healthcare system and the way we manage chronic disease and at risk populations 

 across all settings;  ï· improving hospital care;  ï· addressing health inequality, particularly for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders but also for other 

 population groups ; and  ï· establishing the long term architecture for healthcare reform in our healthcare system and embedding  continuous improvement and innovation in our healthcare system.  Identifying priorities doesn’t mean ignoring other important issues. But I think it’s important to be clear and determined  about the priorities for healthcare reform early. Trying to fix everything all at once risks achieving very little.   

 We have already made some very significant announcements.   

 In relation to primary care in particular, last week, we announced that a Shorten Labor Government will unfreeze the  Medicare Benefits Schedule from 1 January 2017. Indexation will resume for all items provided by GPs, medical  specialists, allied health and other health practitioners.   

 It was no accident that this was our first major health announcement of the campaign.   

 That reflected the importance of primary care in Labor’s thinking and Australia’s health system. As I have quoted  again and again:   

 “health systems with strong primary healthcare are more efficient, have lower rates of hospitalisation, fewer  health inequalities and better health outcomes”.   

 Both the AMA’s and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners’ advocacy has been critical in Labor taking  this decision.    

 Sooner rather than later we know that the freeze will result in less bulk billing, and more and higher co-payments.   

 When one in 20 Australians already skips or delays seeing a GP because of cost that is not something we can afford  to let happen. When our population is ageing and chronic disease is growing, we should be investing more in primary  care, not less.   

 Cost is also a barrier for access to prescription drugs. We know that up to one in eight Australians doesn’t fill their  scripts because medicines are already unaffordable for them. 

 

 So our second major health announcement was that a Shorten Labor Government will scrap the Abbott-Turnbull  Government’s increases to PBS co-payments. Under Labor, Australians will not have to pay the extra $5 per script,  and concession patients will not have to pay an extra 80 cents.     

 These policies come at a price. They are not easy decisions to take given the current fiscal circumstances and  competing demands.    

 But in the end, budgets come down to choices and values.   

 Labor has also unveiled a number of smaller health policies - smaller, but just as important. Yesterday, Bill Shorten  announced that Labor will expand the Deadly Choices program nationwide to help Close the Gap in Indigenous  health. This builds on our earlier commitments to improve the eye and kidney health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander peoples.   

 We have also announced significant new investments to tackle ovarian, prostate and breast cancer. These will  improve care and support for Australians living with these insidious diseases, as well as fund life-saving research. On  Tuesday, I announced Labor’s approach to developing new models of Palliative Care, an important part of healthcare  reform.   

 The Australian Healthcare Reform Commission and Centre for Medicare and Healthcare System Innovation   Today, I’m pleased to be able to make Labor’s third major health announcement of the campaign.   

 Thanks to successive Labor governments, Australia boasts a world-class healthcare system.  We achieve health  outcomes that are amongst the best in the world, while spending no more than the OECD average.   

 But no healthcare system is perfect, and ours is under increasing strain.  Rising rates of chronic disease, an ageing  population and structural flaws are threatening its universality.   

 If our healthcare system is to meet the changing healthcare needs of all Australians, we must have a continuing  process of policy and program development, implementation, evaluation and feedback.   

 But our recent health reform journey has been marked by cycles of boom and bust. Two steps forward, one step back  - and sometimes the other way around.   

 Last year, at this Conference, I said:   

 “Health reform is hard and complex to achieve. It can only occur when it is led by a national government  working with the states and clinicians.  Health reform takes time and can be a decades-long process. It needs to be allowed to make mistakes  along the way and it needs to be embedded in a way that survives changes of Government.”   

 The solutions to some of the big and difficult questions in healthcare go well beyond the life cycle of any one  government.   

 The Health and Hospital reforms initiated when Labor was last in government were a start. These were important  reforms that had the potential to greatly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our healthcare system. But these  did not even survive the first Budget after the change of government.   

 This boom and bust cycle in healthcare reform is not helping find let alone embed solutions to problems such as how  do we provide funding and incentives for things the healthcare system does not do-avoiding hospital admissions for  example. How do we fund and value a system that better prevents people getting sick, keeps at bay chronic disease  or manages these patients in a way that better improves health outcomes.  How do we fund care coordination,  encourage multi-disciplinary team care, provide better access across primary care settings in a way that we can  sustain and improve healthcare quality. What are the best mechanisms to achieve more efficient use of health  funding.    

 These and the many more challenges facing our healthcare system require long term thinking and long term  solutions.   

 That is why I am announcing that a Shorten Labor Government will establish a permanent Australian Healthcare  Reform Commission.   

 The Commission will assist governments to continuously improve our healthcare system. Like the successful National  Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, the new Commission will have a key advisory role.  It will develop and  evaluate proposed changes to Australia’s healthcare system, and advise governments on them - including States  and Territories.   

 The Commission will also have a strong capacity to implement these changes. It will be tasked with rolling out agreed  structural reforms to our healthcare system, including changes to funding agreements and payment systems.   

 The Commission will be focussed on preserving universality, reducing inequality, eliminating waste and duplication,  integrating services and improving the collection and use of data.   

 In doing so, the Commission will take on the reform roles of several agencies that the Liberals have abolished or  downgraded. These include:   

 ï· the National Health Performance Authority;  ï· the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority;  ï· the National Health Funding Body;  ï· the former Health Workforce Australia; and  ï· the former Australian National Preventive Health Agency.  The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care will also be rolled in to the Australian Healthcare  Reform Commission.   

 Under a Shorten Labor Government, the Commission will also include a new Centre for Medicare and Healthcare  System Innovation. It will be charged with developing, trialling, evaluating and implementing new payment and  service delivery models that both aim to reduce health expenditure while rewarding and improving the quality and  safety of care.    

 The Centre will include the functions of the current MBS Review. Unlike the Liberals, however, a Shorten Labor  Government will reinvest any savings realised through the MBS Review into new models of care. This will be  overseen by the Centre for Medicare and Healthcare System Innovation and one of the first tasks of the Centre will  be to provide the Government with advice on the best approach to making this occur.    

 It is Labor’s vision that the new Centre will provide opportunities for new models in primary care, including the current  work on patient centred medical homes, new partnerships between service providers to trial different models to  manage chronic disease between primary care and hospital settings and the opportunity to then roll these models out  across the country where they prove to achieve better quality of care, better health outcomes and more efficient  expenditure of funding.   

 The Australian Healthcare Reform Commission will report to the Council of Australian Governments through the  Standing Council on Health. It will be created through the consolidation of existing agencies and resources from the  Department of Health.   

 Conclusion  The announcements Labor has made in health to date are significant. Unfreezing the Medicare rebate and scrapping  PBS price hikes to protect bulk billing and affordable access to medicines, tackling health inequality for Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islanders, supporting new models of palliative care.   

 Labor is committed to embedding reform into our healthcare system and putting our reform journey beyond political  cycles.   

 The establishment of the Commission and the Centre, alongside Primary Healthcare Networks will provide the  architecture for future healthcare system reform.   

 But governments can’t go it alone. As I have said, real reform must be driven by clinicians, and the patients they  serve.   

 So Labor looks forward to working with the AMA, the colleges, and your other professional and advocacy bodies.  Together, we can chart a course toward the vision we all share - a truly universal healthcare system that provides  high quality care to all Australians.    

 Thank you, and I’m happy to take questions.
