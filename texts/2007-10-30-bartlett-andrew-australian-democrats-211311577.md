 Andrew Bartlett: A Record of Achievement  Andrew Bartlett has built a long and proud record of action in his ten years in  the Senate.  He has successfully negotiated and amended a wide range of laws,  ensuring major improvements and innovations.   

 He has spoken out on a huge range of issues, asked hundreds of questions of  government Ministers and representatives and supported many groups and  people in the community in their efforts to improve our society, environment and  world.

 He engages openly and transparently with the public, and since 2004 this  includes his regularly updated blog on his website.

 He regularly campaigns against governments trying to weaken the power and  role of the Senate and the Parliament

 Following is an outline of some of his work and achievements as a Senator.
