  Further steps were announced in the Budget today to help newly-arrived migrants/  pa(ticulerly those with special r"Ieeds/ settle more quickly and successfully in  Australia. 

  The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Bolkl,JS, said the changes  are tergetedat recent arrivals, emerging comrllunities and special I~eeds groups  such as refugees and the unemployed . 

  A $2 million Increase in on-going fundir"lg would Improve the capncity of the  national network of Migrant Resource C~ntres (MRCs)' to facilitate the effective  settlement of special needs groups, especially refugees and the unemployod. 

  Senator Bolkus said that as pert of their ~stabllshed advocacy (ole, he expects all  MRCs to advocate the Ir'lterests of non-English~speQking background migrarlts in  employment and economic development initiatives.

  As a response to a study of humsr"Iitarian settlement needs, MRCs would be given  resources to better meet the needs of individual refugees/ by assessing their  settlement needs and providing support when needed to Improve their ability to  settle quickly into Au~tralian society. 

  Some $420 000 is also being allocated to Improve the delivery of settl~mentâ  related information to newly-arriving migrQr"lts and humanitarian entrants,  particularly those With low levels of literacy in their first languaQe.
