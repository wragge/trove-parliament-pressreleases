 MEDIA RELEASE  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER 

 AA 03 015 20 Mar 2003 

 Additional Australian Support for Humanitarian  Efforts in Iraq

 Additional Australian Support for Humanitarian Efforts in Iraq

 I announce today that Australia will provide a further $7.5 million to assist in preparations for  humanitarian relief operations in Iraq.

 This new assistance brings the total of our humanitarian preparedness contribution to $17.5  million. We have previously allocated $10 million to UN humanitarian agencies and the  International Committee of the Red Cross for humanitarian assistance planning and  preparation.

 The new funding will help agencies including UNICEF, UNHCR and selected Australian  NGOs with experience in the region, to support vulnerable communities, particularly Iraqi  women and children, and to establish refugee facilities in Jordan.

 Australia will also be providing highly qualified Australian aid personnel to fill key positions  in international humanitarian agencies.

 Australia has a proud record of providing humanitarian assistance and emergency aid and  Australians can be reassured that we will make significant further contributions towards  humanitarian assistance.

 With our international partners, we are also actively seeking to ensure that the suspended UN  Oil-for-Food Programme can be resumed as quickly as possible to meet vital humanitarian  needs in Iraq.

 We support a strong UN role in post-conflict Iraq, and we welcome the commitment made in  the Azores statement by the US, UK and Spanish leaders which foreshadowed a significant  role for international institutions, including the UN, in reconstruction, humanitarian relief and  supporting a transitional post-conflict administration in Iraq.
