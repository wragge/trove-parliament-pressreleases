 SEND SHEEP TO REFUGEES - DEMOCRATS

 "Instead of committing the obscene act of slaughtering and  burying thousands of sheep, the Australian Government should look  at ways of using them to feed the endless refugees now assembling  in Jordan," Australian Democrat Senator, Sid Spindler, said  today.

 "The Government has already proven how willing it is to  answer the military call in the Middle East. Now it must show  that it is equally capable of being humanitarian in the region."

 "In large measure the Government is responsible for the  current crisis in the sheep industry through its refusal to  recognise that the inhumane live sheep export trade was 

 unsustainable."

 "This is a chance for the Government to salvage the mess it  has created by purchasing excess stock, slaughtering it in  Australia under appropriate supervision, and making it available  to the refugees in Jordan."

 "Hundreds of thousands of people are being displaced through  the events taking place in the Middle East, including the trade  blockade, and to prevent a disaster of monumental scale urgent  food supplies must be provided to alleviate suffering."

 "Instead of throwing away $3.6 million each twelve days  supporting our futile naval adventure, Australia's role could be  one of humanitarian importance."

 "Australia is already playing a significant part 

 particularly through non-government agencies and this is yet  another way we could demonstrate our compassion and concern for  innocent victims, men, women and children, caught up in this  appalling tragedy," Senator Spindler concluded.
