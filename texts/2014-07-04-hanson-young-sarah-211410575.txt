 Morrison’s mission: an international disgrace   

 In less than 24 hours the Australian government has received two significant warnings  from the world leading organisation responsible for overseeing the protection of  refugees, the Australian Greens have said.    

 “Scott Morrison’s cruel ‘at all costs’ mission is becoming an international disgrace”,  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “The UN has profound concerns about the Australian government’s attempts to transfer  asylum seekers on the high seas and now they are calling for an end to the detention of  children.    

 “It is clear that the international community is sending a strong message to the  Australian government to end this cruelty toward refugees and asylum seekers.    

 “Handing vulnerable asylum seekers back to the very people they are fleeing, in the  middle of the ocean, is unlawful and dangerous.    

 “It is simply unacceptable for the government to dismiss the concerns raised by the UN,  particularly when children are involved.    

 “In their report today, the UN has called for an immediate end to the detention of  children.    

 “We know that detention causes unnecessary suffering and that the consequences are  irreversible.    

 “Children do not belong in detention and they do not belong in custody on Australia’s  prison ships.
