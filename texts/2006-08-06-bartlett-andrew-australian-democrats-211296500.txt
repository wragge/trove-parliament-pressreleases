 Australian Democrats Press Releases

 Crunch time for Refugee Bill

 The Democrats say the Prime Minister's refusal to further amend his latest asylum seeker laws means  the legislation should be thrown out.   

 "Even the very short Senate Inquiry into the legislation showed quite clearly that this legislation is  inherently unjust and undermines basic rights that make up the foundation of our democracy," Senator  Bartlett said.   

 "There is simply no need for this legislation to pass. It was conceived in a moment of madness to try to  appease the anger of the Indonesian government, and even Mr Howard now concedes that that problem  in our relationship is behind us."   

 "Mr Howard is simply ignoring reality and relying on misleading mantras about border protection to cover  up the gross injustices embedded in this legislation."   

 "To say that this legislation is about border protection is just another of Mr Howard's lies."    

 "Asylum seekers pose no threat to our borders, as they always seek to make their presence known as  soon as possible. There has also never been any evidence that an asylum seeker has been linked with  terrorism indeed they are usually fleeing terrorists or state violence and oppression."    

 Senator Bartlett attended the release today of a research report by widely recognised immigration law  export, Associate Professor Mary Crock.    

 "Mary Crock's research shows quite clearly that processing asylum seekers offshore has meant much  greater chance of refugees being sent back to anger, including children."   

 The legislation is due for debate in the House of Representatives this week, where it is expected to pass.  It is likely to be brought in the Senate the following week, where the vote of a single Liberal Senator  could be enough to defeat it.
