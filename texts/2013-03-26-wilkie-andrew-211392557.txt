 STATEMENT REGARDING ASYLUM SEEKERS   

 

 The latest asylum seeker boat tragedy is another damning indictment of the Government’s 

 flawed irregular immigration policy.  

 

 This is not a border security problem but a humanitarian challenge. 

 

 Unless and until there is a sophisticated policy addressing source, first asylum and transit 

 countries the boats will keep coming. 

 

 It’s way beyond time for the Government to craft such a policy.
