 FEDERAL LABOR LEADER  KEVIN RUDD MP   

 TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH PETER GARRETT,  SHADOW MINISTER FOR CLIMATE CHANGE & ENVIRONMENT, AND  WAYNE SWAN, SHADOW TREASURER, PARLIAMENT HOUSE,  CANBERRA, 31 MARCH 2007   

 E & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:  National Climate Change Summit; David Hicks; SMH  Article    

 RUDD:  Well, today we are in the business of preparing for how we  best forge a national consensus on climate change. Climate change is the great  moral challenge of our generation.  Climate change is a great environmental  challenge, a great economic challenge, it’s a social challenge.  And it’s a  challenge which also goes to the heart of our long term national security interests  as well.   

 We see our responsibility as the alternative government of Australia as how we  best start forging our national consensus on the best response from Australia to  climate change.  That’s why we’ve convened this National Summit in order to  bring together the best brains from across the country; those from science, those  from the business community; those from the union movement; those from the  community sector, and others.    

 We’re also pleased to have representation from the States and Territories at a  senior level.  The reason we’ve done this is to make sure that in shaping our  response as the alternative government to climate change, we have the best  advice that’s on offer.  Ultimately, this then is a question for governments and  political decisions have to be taken.  But we want to make sure that those  decisions are taken in the best informed way possible.     

 Already in the discussion this morning, we’ve had a range of ideas put forward.   The session that we’ve just concluded deals with the impact of climate change.   Not just the environmental impact, but also the economic impact, the jobs impact,  and beyond that in terms of the health impact, and the national security impact as  well - what happens with rising sea levels when it comes to island states in the  South Pacific.  What happens when it comes to so-called environmental  refugees.  What happens when we begin to see greater competition for scarce  resources, including food resources, with accelerated climate change and the 

 impact it has on agriculture across Asia.  These, therefore, command our  attention as the alternative government.     

 One of the proposals that I put for consideration by delegates to this Climate  Change Summit today is how do we best reorganise as a nation to deal with this.   I proposed, for their consideration, the establishment of an Office of Climate  Change within the overall Prime Minister’s portfolio.  That may be necessary if  we are to draw together the various elements of this debate to deal with the  complex inter-agency, inter-jurisdictional, interstate, international tensions which  arise from framing the best response to this challenge which affects us all.     

 One of the other proposals which we’ll discuss during the course of the day is  this.  We’ve suggested to the Government a number of times in recent days that  we need to produce an Australian Stern Report - that is for Treasury to  commission a report on the economic and jobs impact on Australia if there is no  policy change when it comes to dealing with climate change.   

 We have a false dichotomy debate in Australia at present whereby it’s assumed  that there are just two sides of the argument - there’s an environmental side of  the argument and there’s an economic side of the argument.  We argue that both  of these things are intimately linked.  If you don’t act on climate change you are  sacrificing jobs and the economy long term, and even in the shorter term as well.   

 Therefore, one of the proposals we’ll be putting is whether or not we should now  commence, ourselves, to frame terms of reference for a proper investigation of  the economic and jobs impact on Australia if there is no policy change, effective  policy change, on climate change.   

 Interestingly, I’m advised that States’ Treasurers and Territory Treasurers put  such a proposal to Treasurer Costello yesterday.  I understand Treasurer  Costello declined, saying that in fact all this work was already being done.  Well,  it’s not being done and we need the data.   

 The third thing which we’ll discuss later in the day is this, and it goes to the key  question of China.  I’ve flagged in the past the need for an Australian diplomatic  initiative with China on the question of how we get China into the global  emissions reduction framework.  What I’m proposing to do is to take a delegation 

 of Shadow Ministers and some from science and some from business to China  over the course of the next three months in order to begin a series of roundtables  with the Chinese on this important question for the future.   

 Happy to take your questions.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Rudd, you said in your preamble, in your opening  address, that you were open to ideas.  We didn’t hear the word “nuclear”  mentioned.  Is that actually going to be discussed? 

 

 RUDD:  Well, that’s a matter for those who are at the Summit  themselves.  Our position on the nuclear question I think you’re quite familiar  with, which is that even if you take some of the more generous assumptions in  the Switkowski Report the overall impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions  is relatively modest.  And secondly, it happens quite late in the cycle when you’re  talking about that occurring in some time between 15 and 25 years from now, the  climate change policy response projections where we need action is a much  nearer term thing than that.  Therefore, we talk about the need for early action on  demand size management.  We talk about the need, therefore, for an emissions  trading regime now.  We talk about the need for boosting the mandatory  renewable energy target.  We talk about accelerating our investment in clean  coal technology.  These are things which need to be done now.  On the nuclear  question, leaving aside all the other elements of the nuclear debate, it happens  far too late in the cycle.   

 JOURNALIST: If you’re already talking in a 50-80 year timeframe, if that’s  the case, (inaudible) and you should be discussing it now.   

 RUDD:  When it comes to the question of stabilisation and the  stabilisation projections which are put forward by the consensus documents from  the science community, it’s quite clear that significant action needs to be taken  now and that’s why the measures that we have up for debate today primarily  focus on those where action can occur in a much nearer term.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Rudd, in a recent submission BHP said that Australia  should link (inaudible) China and India to things (inaudible) bilateral (inaudible)  agreements.  Do you agree with that?   

 RUDD:  Well, I haven’t seen that submission so I’ll be reluctant to  comment on it, Steve …   

 JOURNALIST: Would you agree that access to our resources should be  linked with China and India coming on board in some form of a climate change  agreement?   

 RUDD:  What I argue is this.  We are a huge supplier of carbon-based energies to the Chinese.  We are more broadly a huge supplier of  resources to the Chinese.  China’s long term economic development in part  relies upon us as a continued secure supplier of resources.  Therefore, I believe  that gives us genuine negotiating leverage with the Chinese to begin to engage  them bilaterally and, ideally, multilaterally, on taking on new responsibilities on  their part for reducing their own national carbon footprint.  Unless we deal with  China effectively, and in the near term, then frankly, we’re not being serious  about a global response to climate change.  I simply take the view that it provides  us with leverage to get in the door.  That’s one of the reasons why I want to take 

 a delegation of senior frontbenchers from our side, prior to the election, to Beijing  to begin a round of roundtables with the Chinese on these questions.   

 JOURNALIST: The Prime Minister seems to imply that he understands the  (inaudible) changes to the way you deal with carbon and carbon emissions.  Why  are you so sure the Government doesn’t know what its talking about?  Why do  you think (inaudible)?   

 RUDD:  Well, when you have quite recently the Prime Minister in  Parliament still exhibiting clear signs of being a climate change sceptic, that’s  exhibit one.  Exhibit two is the Finance Minister, quite a senior Minister in the  Government, still saying that the jury is out.  And when you have the Industry  Minister, Minister Macfarlane, failing to recant on his previous statements of  acute climate change scepticism, I think this evidence speaks for itself.  This  Government is full of climate change sceptics.  And climate change sceptics  cannot be part, long term, of the climate change solution.    

 Furthermore, what we’re doing here today with this National Climate Change  Summit is something government itself should be doing.  I’m surprised and  disappointed that Mr Howard hasn’t done this.  This is the sort of action which  you need because the challenge of climate change is so big.  It covers  everything.  It covers the environment.  It covers the economy.  It covers our  future social well being and our security.    

 So, I think the Government’s scepticism on this question has led them not to act  either in terms of a Summit like this or to be passive on the whole question of  Australia’s diplomatic engagement on this.  We are not a player in shaping the 

 new architecture.  We should be.   

 JOURNALIST:  Notwithstanding  those  comments, Mr Rudd, doesn’t it  appear to suggest, though, that the Government has gone further than just  scepticism.  They have commissioned a study into the framing of (inaudible)  emissions trading saying on the China front, through AP6, we’ve entered an  agreement with China to develop clean coal technology.  So action, that’s more  than scepticism (inaudible).   

 RUDD:  Well, after 11 years in government and after a number of UN  reports and a number of national reports, what we’re seeing is the beginnings of  some action very late in the piece.  You speak about AP6, in financial terms  that’s a pretty modest initiative.  When you speak of emissions trading, can I say  this?  The Government some years ago formally abolished, or effectively moved  to formally abolish, the emissions trading taskforce lying within the relevant  Australian Government agency.  It’s only very late in the piece in response to the  political pressures of the electoral cycle, Mr Howard has decided to give the  appearance of activity.  We believe this is a big question for the nation long term.  

 And as I said inside before, this should be beyond politics.  It is so big.  I hope in  the future we get to a stage where it is genuinely beyond politics.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Rudd, on the European front, are you concerned that  reports that European countries are considering aviation fuel taxes, punishing  (inaudible) from a tyranny of distance point of view (inaudible)?   

 RUDD:  Well, one of the important contributions which has just been  made inside is from the tourism industry which points to the impact potentially on  the Australian tourism sector when it comes to the specific effect which certain  measures will have on the cost of airline tickets.  When you’re looking at long  haul aviation, when you’re looking about the impact on Australia’s tourism  industry, I mean, two things off the top of your head which become very clear to  us, one is coral bleaching on the Barrier Reef, a huge tourist attraction for  Australia internationally, and two, high wealth tourism out of Europe, which is a  long trip by air.  If in Europe it becomes increasingly the practice that people  begin to look sceptically at the desirability of undertaking long haul trips.  I  believe what we’ve got to do is ensure that in dialogue with our friends around  the world in the aviation industry we come up with some better solutions which  don’t disproportionately punish the Australian tourism industry.  But domestically,  there are going to be challenges as well.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Rudd, I think we also heard this morning, I think the figure  was 150 million potential environmental refugees, how much do you think  (inaudible) of this debate, and what sort of specific policy response is going to be  required in that portfolio?   

 RUDD:  Well, when I said that one of the proposals we put at the  establishment of the Office of Climate Change into the Prime Minister’s portfolio,  what is that for?  It’s because you’re dealing with a series of impacts on the  Australian community which go beyond neat categorisations.  You’re going to 

 have a health policy impact.  You’re going to have a border security impact.   You’re going to have a water security impact.  You’re going to have a food  security impact.  And you’re going to have the whole question of environmental  refugees, with sea waters rising.   

 People often point to the South Pacific and say, well the populations are small.   Go to Bangladesh, the populations are substantial indeed.  Therefore, we need  an integrated whole of government response.  Alan DuPont, in one of his  presentations, said, “We need a national risk audit of the entire impact for this  country of a no-policy change environment on climate change or even a partial  policy change environment”.   I say, as an incoming Labor Government, that’s  precisely what we would do, because for me, this looms right up there as one of 

 the principal challenges which any incoming government of this country will face.   

 JOURNALIST: I was wondering about the role of APEC.  What’s the  potential role of APEC (inaudible) think the Prime Minister should be doing on  (inaudible)?    

 RUDD:  I noted the reports in today’s paper that Mr Howard intends  to raise climate change at the Sydney APEC Summit.  That’s good and I’m all for  that.  My question back to Mr Howard is, what will you be raising, and I’ll be very  keen to see what the detail of that is.  Our problem at present is this.  When it  comes to regional diplomacy and broader multi-national UN based diplomacy, 

 people around the world are saying, where is Australia’s credibility on this  question, if you remain outside Kyoto so decisively and you refuse to participate  effectively, therefore, in the negotiation of the post 2012 architecture for handling 

 greenhouse emissions, you have therefore limited credibility when it comes to  sitting down round the table with our other nation states.     

 And secondly, when you have the Chinese at various conferences effectively  saying that if the United States and Australia remain outside of Kyoto, why  should we as China, begin to act, we have a problem.  Therefore, I’m all ears in  terms of what Mr Howard is putting on the table for APEC.  I’m quite happy with it  being on APEC, I think that’s a good thing,  We’ve got a problem which is getting  our own house in order first.   

 SWAN:  Can I just add to that, because we had the G20 (inaudible) at  the end of last year and Peter Costello refused to put in on the agenda of the  G20.  And secondly, relating to an earlier question, the Treasury, in Senate  Estimates a coupe of months ago, indicated that the Treasury had done no  modelling on the impact of climate change on the Australian economy.  So, that’s  how serious they are.   

 JOURNALIST: So, would you consider (inaudible) carbon credits to offset  the effect (inaudible)?   

 RUDD:  We’re actually examining all that at the moment in terms of  the impact for us personally.  I think that’s a fair call.  We’ll come back with some  proposals on that in due season.  But personal responsibility, corporate 

 responsibility, community responsibility - it’s all part of the equation effectively  dealing in an intelligent way with climate change.  But we’ll come back with  something detailed on that in due course.   

 JOURNALIST: On the issue of - you committed Labor to 60 per cent  reduction by 2050, what about the call for shorter term targets for 2020 or 2030.   What’s your view on that and how (inaudible)?   

 RUDD:  I’ve had advice the other day that the South Australian  Liberal Party has already advocated a 2020 target of a 20 per cent reduction of  greenhouse gases, so I’ll be following that up in some detail.  Our policy is as you 

 described.  When it comes to the next step, that hangs entirely upon the type of  emissions trading scheme that we embark upon.  One of the reasons why we  have a session, I think which is underway in there now on emissions trading 

 schemes and the various models which are on offer within it, is because it  shapes directly then what you’ll then identify potentially as sub-targets.   Therefore, for us the next step is outlining the principles which would govern an  emissions trading scheme under a future Labor Government.  We are working on  that at present.  What then follows subsequent on that is the identification of what  may then be relevant sub-targets within that 2050, 60 per cent reduction range  that we’ve already spoken about.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Howard made a point yesterday announcing his $200  million deforestation initiative, that that was outside the Kyoto Protocol and Kyoto  wouldn’t have addressed that.  I’m wondering specifically what you think of those  initiatives and what the value of it is without (inaudible) as well?   

 RUDD:  Well, I think part of the problem with Mr Howard being a  climate change sceptic and trying to come up with climate change solutions is  that all this is happening in a bit of rush in the lead-up to an election and we don’t  know how serious a lot of it is.     

 On the question of (inaudible) around the world, can I just make this point There  is something under Kyoto called the Clean Development Mechanism.  It is a  huge global fund to which developing countries can apply for substantial  assistance to deal in large measure with some of the deforestation problems we  see, particularly in Brazil and Indonesia - $40 million a year in addition to that, on  top of a multi billion dollar global fund, well I don’t say that’s bad in itself, but let’s  put it into a bit of context.     

 I’ve got to say though in terms of the totality of the Australian greenhouse  response.  One, where is Mr Howard’s target?  Two, where is his position in  terms of emissions trading?  At present, he’s not yet embraced the notion of a  national emissions trading scheme, it’s just that his taskforce is looking at it.   Three, will he boost the Mandatory Renewal Energy Target?  Four, what’s his  national strategy when it comes to demand side management or efficiency.  And  five, we’ve currently got a half billion dollar national clean technology initiative out  there, that’s something about three or four times larger than what Mr Howard has  on offer.  I think we have some runs on the board here before we start talking  about solar and by contrast, there is not much on the table.     

 GARRETT:  Can I just make one other point about, just about Mr  Howard’s initiative and that is that this is effectively when we look at it closely,  what the World Bank pilot programs have been about for some period of time, yet  welcomed by all means, but limited in its capacity and, frankly, not a new idea,  something which the World Bank and others have been talking about happened  for some time.   

 

 And the second thing to say is that the existing CDM which Kevin just referred to  make clear provision for forestry practices is be considered.  So, the line that the  Government ran yesterday in the House was actually wrong.   

 JOURNALIST: Can I just about your response to David Hicks?  What your  response is to the proposed (inaudible) sentence and whether or not the time he  has already served should be included in that?   

 RUDD:  Well, that’s a matter for the appropriate authority to  determine, not a matter for a government or an alternative government to  determine.  On the question of Mr Hicks’ custodial sentence - if in fact it’s been  determined and as of when we’re conducting this press conference I’m not sure  where that is up to - if Mr Hicks receives a custodial sentence and if he is then  subject to an International Prisoner Transfer Agreement which brings him back to 

 Australia, our responsibility, as the alternative government of Australia, is to  honour the legal obligations which flow from that Agreement and which flow from  Australian domestic law.   

 JOURNALIST: What about the time he’s served?  Should that be taken into  account?   

 RUDD:  That’s not a matter for a politician to make comment on.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Rudd, can I just ask you about (inaudible) Treasury  modelling on climate change so when the Prime Minister gets up in Parliament  time and time again and (inaudible) comes out and tell us, you’re saying that he’s  inventing these numbers?  I mean, what’s going on?   

 RUDD:  Well, the problem with Mr Howard’s position is there is an  absence of science to it, both its scepticism on the intrinsics of climate change,  but also the fear campaign which he seeks to run on the economy.  How can you  argue that proposition, it’s (inaudible) to the argument that they run when it  comes to their industrial relations regime.  That is, as Mr Hockey said the other  day, you can’t compare apples with apples.  Well, how can you actually sustain  the argument when it’s going to have a terrible effect on overall employment in  the economy were you to bring about change in the industrial relations laws?  

 There’s no underlying science to that.  There’s no underlying science to their  proposition about the argument that we have on the table when it comes to  climate change.  The challenge to Mr Howard is this: to get serious on climate  change; to stop being so radically out of touch on climate change; get some  facts; get some figures and start a program of national action.  Schwarzenegger,  in California, put it in these terms: climate change represents the first, post-partisan, political issue of our age.  It should be the same in Australia, regrettably  at present it’s not.  Let’s move in that direction.   

 JOURNALIST: On Hicks, Mr Rudd, you’ve said for some time it’s been  unfair (inaudible) process, (inaudible).  Why now, when that it’s coming to a  conclusion, (inaudible) when you say that you’ll honour whatever sentence it  gives him?   

 RUDD:  Our position from the beginning has been we are no  defenders of Mr Hicks.  We are no defenders of what he’s done or what he’s  alleged to have done.  We are the defender of his legal rights and his human  rights.  This legal process entered into a new phase altogether when Mr Hicks  entered his guilty plea.  That new phase involved a settlement of the facts,  sentencing process and any operationalisation of this International Transfer  Prisoner Agreement.  As Mr Howard said in the Parliament the other day, if it is in  the midst of that process, it’s not wise for politicians to make any random  comment on it.  But on the point of law it is this.  We in this country, whether we  are the alternative government or the government, are bound by Australian  domestic law and that case it’s the International Prisoner Transfer Agreement Act  of 1997.  The stipulations within it are quite clear.  It underpins the  intergovernmental agreement which the Australian Government has entered into  with the United States.  As an alternative government, our responsibility is to 

 honour the law and that’s what we propose to do.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Rudd, this morning there’s a prominent column  suggesting that your staff (inaudible) directly pressured the editor of a prominent  Australian newspaper to try to stop the story from being published a few weeks  ago.  Do you have any comment to make on that?   

 RUDD:  Well, first of all, I’ve not seen this report. I’ve heard about it  and I don’t think, from what I’ve heard about it, it is well founded.  I think when it  comes to the questions that it refers to, I simply have my own versions of events  as a kid growing up.  I stick by that version of events. That’s where the story is as  far as I’m concerned.   

 JOURNALIST: Did you try and stop the story being published personally?   

 RUDD:  Not at all.  Not at all.  I simply put my view to the newspaper  in terms of my response to the article as presented to me and they were  reported, as I reflect, at the latter part of the article which was presented.
