 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison 

 Another record month of boat arrivals under Labor 

 29/10/12 

 The arrival of three more illegal boats, with a total of over 100 people on board, means Labor has set  a new record for the number of boats to illegally enter Australia in a month, for the third month in a  row, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today. 

 “36 boats have arrived so far in October, breaking last month’s record of 35, which broke the  previous month’s record of 34 in August. One again more than 2,000 people have turned up in a  month as Labor pass yet another record of over 28,000 people having arrived on illegal boats in the  less than five years they have been in office,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “Almost by the day Labor are breaking new records on border protection failures with more boats  and more people arriving illegally and at a startling rate not seen before,” he said. 

 “With arrivals this financial year running at an average of over 2,000 people a month, no wonder  Wayne Swan has already announced a budget blowout on boats of another $1.2 billion for this year  alone. 

 “Still Labor refuses to reveal how many people they are expecting this financial year, won't reveal  the true cost of re-opening Nauru and Manus Island and won't reveal the total cost of increasing  Australia's refugee and humanitarian intake so that they can continue to offer permanent visas for  illegal boat arrivals. 

 “Labor's failure of resolve, together with their half hearted measures on our borders will see the  boats and budget blow outs continue on their watch,” Mr Morrison said.
