 UK migrants lead the charge to Tasmania 

 27 December 2006 

 Tasmania remains a popular destination for United Kingdom migrants, with an increasing  number of Brits making the move to the Apple Isle. 

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Amanda Vanstone today said 177 UK citizens  relocated to Tasmania in 2005-2006, six more than the previous year and the highest number  since the Coalition came to government in 1996. 

 ‘Overall, 879 migrants made Tasmania their home in the past year, down slightly from 944 in  2004-2005,’ Senator Vanstone said. 

 ‘Other source countries included Sudan with 82 settlers, India with 47, the United States with  33 and South Africa with 34. 

 ‘The Tasmanian community is to be congratulated for welcoming these people into their lives so  readily and willingly.’ 

 On the national front, more than 131 000 people arrived and settled in Australia in 2005-2006,  an increase of about 8000 on the previous year. 

 The largest number of settlers came from the United Kingdom with 23 290, up by about 5000  on last year. 

 Other European countries contributed about 7000 migrants, while the number of new arrivals  from Sudan fell almost 2000 from the last year to 3783. 

 Iraqi arrival numbers were up almost 500 to 2425, while more than 52 000 people from 34  Asian countries made Australia their new home during 2005-2006. 

 Senator Vanstone said the majority of new arrivals entered Australia through the family and  skill streams of the migration programme. 

 ‘Our migration target for 2006-2007 is about 140 000, including 97 500 in the skill stream and  that number does not include the 13 000 refugee and humanitarian entrants who will begin  new lives in Australia through our humanitarian programme.’ 

 The full list of statistics can be found in Settler Arrivals 2005-2006, a Department of  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs publication that has been published on its website at  www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/index.htm.
