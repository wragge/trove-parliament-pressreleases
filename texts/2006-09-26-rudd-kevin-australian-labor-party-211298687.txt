 PRESS RELEASE    

 KEVIN RUDD 

  (SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, TRADE AND  INTERNATIONAL SECURITY)   

 DOWNER’S DARFUR DOUBLE STANDARDS  26 September 2006 

 

 Alexander Downer’s double standards on Darfur are breathtaking.  In an address to  the United Nations General Assembly last week Mr Downer said: 

 “Too often in the world of politics, the temptation is for governments to strike an  attitude and then leave the substantive action for another day, or offload the  responsibility onto others”. 

 Within minutes of this diatribe Mr Downer without a hint of irony did exactly what  he had just criticised others for doing - describing Darfur as a “grievous challenge to  the international community” and a “litmus test” not only of the UN’s  responsibilities but “the most basic principles of civilisation”.  And in the same  breathe he also offloaded the responsibility onto others pointing the finger of blame  at the UN.  

 But where is Mr Downer’s own diplomatic initiative on Darfur? What has Mr  Downer done to address this test of “the most basic principles of civilisation”?  

 The key obstacle to the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force in Darfur is the  Sudanese Government’s refusal to give permission for the deployment of a UN  force.  What discussions has Mr Downer had with the Sudanese Government on this 

 score?  

 A further stumbling block has been the reluctance of UN Security Council members  Russia and China to deploy a UN force without the permission of the Sudanese  Government.   What discussions has Mr Downer had with Russia and China?  

 Rather than spending his week taking in the delights of Helsinki, Brussels and Rome  Mr Downer should be taking the lead and holding diplomatic discussions in  Khartoum, Moscow and Beijing.  

 Mr Downer needs to listen to his own advice that:  “We can make solemn pledges… but  so much of the talk is mere artifice unless backed up by resolute, practical and well-constructed policy responses”. 

 A good start would be to stop off in Khartoum and the refugee camps of Darfur on  his way home from the tea salons of Europe’s capitals.  

 Ends. 26 September 2006.
