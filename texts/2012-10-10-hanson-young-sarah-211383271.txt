 Australian Greens Media Release   

 Papua New Guinea detention, rehashing an old  idea   

 Today Labor and the Coalition have ganged up to ensure that men, women and children will face  indefinite detention on Papua New Guinea by voting down an amendment put forward by  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.   

 “Today I moved an amendment to limit the length of detention for people on Papua New  Guinea to 12 months and Labor voted it down, choosing to continue to damage people’s mental  health with a regime of distressing and indefinite offshore detention,” Greens spokesperson for  immigration, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “It is now beyond dispute that indefinite detention damages people and the old parties of Labor  and the Coalition have ganged up to make sure that many more people will be subjected to  harm for no reason.   

 “Far from being able to guarantee that Papua New Guinea will do better in regards to caring for  the mental health and general care of refugees, the Government hasn’t been able to answer the  simplest of questions.   

 “How long are these vulnerable people going to be held in detention, when will mothers and  children be sent to offshore processing and how can a system designed to hold 2100 people  offshore cope with the number of people looking for protection?   

 “PNG is not a full signatory to the Refugee Convention as they have failed to guarantee,  amongst other things, refugees’ rights to housing, education and freedom of movement.   

 “The boats haven’t stopped, Australia’s reputation as the land of a ‘fair go’ is being tarnished  and I will be asking the Immigration Department exactly how much this is costing the tax payer  in Senate estimates. 

 “The Greens have always said that punitive offshore dumping will not work as a deterrent and  the only way to achieve the goal of reducing deaths at sea is by giving people the option of safer  pathways than a risky boat by resettling them directly from the places they are waiting, such as  Indonesia.”
