 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 Introduction

 The 2001 Australian election, called just three weeks after the terrorist attacks

 of September 11 and six weeks after the Tampa asylum-seeker incident', served to

 conflate 11th-hour security issues with an election campaign that had, for most of the

 election year, revolved purely around several domestic issues: health, education and

 taxation. In so doing, it confronted female voters with two distinct, high profile sets

 of issues that have been argued to underlie important, if contradictory, dynamics in

 the evolution of the gender gap in electoral politics.

 Most western democracies, with the emergence of survey research in the

 1940s, chronicled a pervasive, traditional conservatism in women's politics that was

 evident in studies for more than a generation (Duverger, 1955; Lipset, 1963; Almond

 and Verba, 1963; and Randall, 1982). However, as the fundamental social and

 occupational roles of women were transformed in post-industrial society, these same

 nations, beginning in the 1980s, witnessed the displacement of women's

 conservatism by a distinctly progressive or 'leftist' bias in women's political issue

 orientations (Jelen, Thomas and Wilcox, 1994; De Vaus and McAllister, 1989; and

 Karp and Banducci, 2000). This was evident both in women's more compassionate

 stances on domestic policies such as health, education and the environment (Gilens,

 1984; Welch and Thomas, 1988; and Wilcox, 1991a), and in their stronger opposition

 to war and the use of force (De Vaus and McAllister, 1989: 242; Hayes and

 McAllister, 1997: 11; and Studlar, McAllister and Hayes, 1998: 783).

 And yet, recent poll results in the United States, which for twenty years had

 seen a pro-Democratic gender gap, have pointed to a post-September 11 rise of

 women's anxiety about terrorism and national security, which has prompted a

 conservative "sea change" in women's attitudes about security and military issues

 (see Tumulty and Novak, 2003). The result has been the transformation of one-time

 "soccer Moms," who worried about family resources, health and education — and

 voted Democratic — into "security Moms," whose newfound concern for national

 security and defence spending has brought the conservative Republican Party to

 Page 2

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 electoral parity with the Democrats, and assisted in their historic 2002 mid-term

 Congressional victory.2

 This new, post-September 11 conservatism, however, may not necessarily

 signal the ability of terrorism to precipitate an across-the-board return to women's

 traditional conservatism. Indeed, American research has shown that women's fears

 about security and defence have not displaced their deep-seeded, progressive

 concerns about domestic issues: "on all kinds of measures, women are more worried

 than men. ..they're worried about their personal security, but that doesn't mean

 security Moms aren't still concerned about education, health care and social security"

 (Democratic Pollster, Anne Greenberg, quoted in Tumulty and Novak, 2002: 2). In

 short, the rising salience of terrorism and defence following September 11 has

 prompted new tensions between women's emergent conservatism on security issues

 and their established progressive stances on domestic concerns — tensions whose

 electoral implications have yet to be fully explored.

 The 2001 Australian federal election represents perhaps the best opportunity

 in the world to examine the impact of security concerns on women's politics. As a

 parliamentary election fought for partisan control of national government

 immediately after two major security incidents, the 2001 election confronted

 Australia's women even more sharply than their American counterparts with

 diametric alternatives and party-based sets of issue evaluations in their vote choice.

 On the one hand, voters could choose a conservative Liberal-National Coalition

 government that had premised its campaign predominantly on the themes of

 terrorism, security and border protection (McAllister, forthcoming, 2003). The Prime

 Minister, John Howard, tapped the pervasive uncertainty of the times — and the well-known proclivity of voters to support the incumbent government during times of

 external threat (See Bean and McAllister, 2002: 271) — and was also able to fuse the

 issues of asylum-seeking refugees and national security, thus making it the central

 campaign theme for the Coalition: "Because Howard had defined the issue as border

 protection and linked it with the September 11 terrorist attacks, asylum-seekers had

 become a defence issue" (Charlton, 2002: 79). It was an anthem Howard trumpeted

 Page 3

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 perhaps most famously in his official campaign launch speech, in which he

 proclaimed: "We will decide who comes to Australia and the circumstances under

 which they come" (Charlton and Solomon, 2002: 1).

 On the other hand, voters could choose a Labor 3 opposition, whose campaign

 and electoral fortunes were premised virtually wholly on a domestic issue platform -especially education, health, and the Goods and Services Tax — issues that had looked

 for nearly a year to be their ticket for securing victory (Denemark and Devereux,

 2002; Bean and McAllister, 2002: 271; and Charlton and Solomon, 2002: 4-5). Because

 the Australian Labor Party (ALP) had few options for countering the Prime

 Minister's inherent advantage on international issues during times of external crisis,

 its strategic response was to seek to "differentiate itself from the Government on the

 GST, jobs, education and health, while fully supporting the Government on refugees

 and the war on terrorism" (Warhurst, 2002: 12). In short, Labor ceded the issues of

 terrorism and refugees to the government, thus polarizing voters' evaluative

 alternatives during the campaign. 4 The near-exclusive emphasis of ALP leader, Kim

 Beazley, on domestic themes was evident throughout the election campaign — in the

 October 14 leaders debate, in the party's TV advertising and in Beazley's speech at

 the party's official campaign launch, in which he devoted only eight lines of his

 address to anything other than Labor's domestic issue agenda. Overall, it seems

 clear that Labor, by default, was "staking its claims on domestic issues" (Charlton

 and Solomon, 2002: 4-5).

 Thus, in a fundamental way, Australian women in the 2001 election were

 compelled to choose between security and domestic issues — two sets of issues with

 distinctly different implications for gender politics — in deciding between the

 incumbent and opposition parties and selecting the next government. This paper,

 using 2001 Australian Election Study survey data, 5 examines the gender gap in

 political preferences in an election, which, because it precipitated distinct issue-based

 alternatives for those involved, promises to illuminate a number of assumptions in

 gender gap theory.

 The Gender Gap in Electoral Decision-Making: Three Alternative Patterns

 The evaluative calculus faced by women in the 2001 Australian election can be

 seen from three different perspectives that have emerged in the literature — each

 predicting different patterns for women's political evaluations and votes. These are

 presented as alternative sets of analytic assumptions by which to gauge the

 Australian empirical results that follow.

 Hi Hypothesizing a Conservative Gender Gap in Australia

 Historically, women's political preferences have been more conservative than

 those of men — a conservative gender gap for which a variety of explanations have

 emerged. These include the influences of childhood socialisation and the

 internalisation of conservative gender roles (Baxter and Lansing, 1983), women's

 closer ties to, and participation in, the conservative influences of established churches

 (see Dogan, 1967; Inglehart, 1981; and De Vaus and McAllister, 1989) and women's

 lower rates of participation in the paid labour force — precipitating a number of

 economic, workplace/occupational and organized political implications (see, for

 example, De Vaus and McAllister, 1989). Despite the erosion of many of these points

 of socio-economic distinction between men and women, and the political differences

 they promote (see McAllister, 1992: 138; and Banducci and Karp, 2000: 816),

 significant conservative gender gaps have remained into the 1980s in Italy, France,

 Spain and Belgium (De Vaus and McAllister, 1989: 249).6

 In Australia, women up to and through the 1960s echoed the broader cross-national pattern of a conservative gap (De Vaus and McAllister, 1989: 249), though

 their traditional support of the right-wing Liberal Party has varied across time (see

 Leithner, 1997). While several studies have suggested the Australian gender gap

 evaporates with controls for socio-economic and occupational factors (Studlar,

 McAllister and Hayes, 1998: 792; Leithner, 1997: 44) other evidence has substantiated

 a conservative gender gap in political leader evaluations and their interactive effects

 on vote choice (see Hayes and McAllister, 1997). More broadly, Renfrow has found

 evidence of a significant conservative bias amongst Australian women — one that is

 Page 5

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 as clear cut amongst young women as amongst older women (Renfrow, 1994: 122-3),

 and is evident in party vote patterns, leader evaluations and, marginally, in pro-Liberal policy biases for issues including medicare, health, education and the

 environment (1994: 126-7).

 All told, a hypothetical case can be made for women as resisting the pattern

 increasingly evident in other western democracies and sustaining distinct political

 preferences by gender, evident in an essentially undifferentiable conservative

 Australian gender gap. In the context of the current study, these patterns would lead

 us to anticipate a broad, conservative gender gap in terms of political vote choice,

 unappreciably differentiated by age and education.

 H2 Hypothesizing a Progressive Gender Gap in Australia

 While virtually every study of gender-based political preferences has pointed

 to the prevalence of a conservative gender gap in the decades preceding the 1980s

 (see, e.g., the summary in Randall, 1982), they detail, as well, the decline of these

 political distinctions by the close of the 1980s. As women began to approximate the

 socio-economic, occupational and educational realities of men, the social structural

 impediments to their political equivalence were said to erode (Studlar, McAllister,

 and Hayes, 1998). At the same time, the situational distinctions that continue to

 differentiate the genders due to women's ongoing domestic responsibilities (Hayes,

 1993; Jelen, Thomas and Wilcox, 1994: 172) and inroads made by feminism in

 consciousness-raising (Wilcox, 1991b) are said to have propelled an emergent,

 progressive gender gap in the realm of issue and policy orientations, evident

 primarily in support for progressive stances on welfare, education and the

 environment (Studlar, McAllister and Hayes, 1998: 783) and in women's disdain for

 the use of military force and defence spending (Gilens, 1984).

 [Figure 1 About Here]

 In Australia, McAllister (1992: 138) has found an overall decline in the

 electoral gender gap (see Figure 1, which extends McAllister's table to 2001), given an

 eroding significance for religion and diminishing structural differences between the

 Page 6

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 genders (also see Aitkin, 1982; and Leithner, 1997), while De Vaus and McAllister

 (1989) have found a left or progressive gender gap, once differences between the

 genders for labour force and religious participation are controlled for. All told, then,

 these findings suggest the possibility in the current study of a modest progressive, or

 left, gender gap, sustained primarily by women's progressive orientations on several

 key domestic issues, and on their opposition to military force.

 H3 Hypothesizing an Age-Specific Gender Gap in Australia

 Implicit in much of the recent research on the gender gap is the potential for a

 differential realization of the gender gap by age. $ Because women's traditional

 conservatism has been shown to be primarily the product of structural and

 situational factors that have been displaced or weakened in recent years, women's

 politics may manifest a "gender-generation gap" (Norris, 1996). In this case, because

 older women are still more likely than men to be church-goers, to have low

 education and not to participate in the paid or unionised work force (Leithner, 1996:

 45) they are likely to be more conservative than men in their political preferences. At

 the same time, younger women, who are increasingly highly educated, secular, and

 involved in the paid and unionised workforce, are likely to lose their conservative

 distinctiveness, due to their increasing comparability with men on these factors,

 while they assume an increasingly progressive distinctiveness due to the impact of

 women's different issue orientations (Studlar, McAllister and Hayes, 1998). In short,

 while younger, more progressive women may ultimately displace the bulk of older,

 more conservative women (see the "divergence thesis" in Renfrow, 1994: 120), in the

 short term a "gender-generation gap" may manifest simultaneous progressive and

 conservative gender gaps.

 Norris has found evidence of this sort of gender-generation gap in British

 voting behaviour and in European left/right self-placements:

 Instead of acting as a homogeneous voting bloc, younger and older women are deeply divided in party preferences. Older women remain more conservative than older men, with significant consequences for party

 Page 7

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 fortunes given the number of older women in the electorate. Nevertheless,

 younger women are more left-wing than their male counterparts (1996: 333)

 If anything, Norris contends, the left-right gender-generation gap strengthened in the

 1990s — with younger women affirming more left-wing self-placements than their

 male counterparts, and older women holding more right-wing self-placements than

 their male counterparts (1996: 339).

 Clearly, in the Australian context, these findings suggest the possibility of an

 age-specific gender gap, yielding sharply differentiated political preferences for

 women, distinguished by age. But perhaps of greater significance, given both the

 strong salience of security issues during the 2001 election campaign, and the stark

 choice for Australian voters between a domestically-oriented progressive party and

 an security-oriented conservative party, is the possibility that terrorism and security

 concerns prompted an issue-based gender-generation gap, in which older women

 were significantly more likely than men to be conservative on security and defence

 issues, while younger women were significantly more likely than men to be

 progressive on domestic issues. These alternative hypotheses are tested next.

 Findings and Discussion

 Gender and Issue Salience: Domestic and Security Concerns

 The 2001 Australian election campaign, as we have seen, conflated two high

 profile issue agendas, security and domestic — each disproportionately associated

 with, and of electoral benefit to, a different major party. As a way of gauging the

 relative electoral importance of various issues for male and female respondents' vote

 decision-making Table One reports the proportion of respondents who cited each of

 twelve issues as "most important" to the

 [Table One About Here]

 respondent and their family during the campaign — yielding aggregate rankings for

 each gender. Table One shows that there is broad comparability between men and

 women in their estimations of issue importance, with women most likely to cite

 education, health and medicare, and the Goods and Services Tax, while men most

 Page 8

 David Denmark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 often cited taxation, health, and education as the most important campaign issues.

 For both men and women, then, domestic concerns were the most salient in the 2001

 campaign. Amongst the security and international concerns, the issue of refugees

 and asylum-seekers was most frequently cited by both men and women, giving it an

 overall ranking of 4 for both genders. Defence and national security was seen as

 most important by roughly comparable proportions of men and women (6% and

 5.7%), while, curiously, the issue of terrorism — which received, along with refugees

 and asylum seekers, the most TV election news coverage (Denemark, 2002: 9) was

 deemed the most important issue by only 4.8% of respondents overall, leaving it

 ranked 6 th amongst the twelve issues for women, and 9 t'' for men. All told, the

 patterns in Table One suggest that men and women, considered in the aggregate,

 were not substantially different in their overall estimations of the importance of

 various issues, and that both felt the campaign's most important issues were drawn

 from domestic, not security, concerns.

 Table Two reports, for each of the twelve AES issues, the proportion of

 [Table Two About Here]

 men and women who deemed a given issue to be "most important" during the

 election campaign. While the overall rankings of issue importance in Table One

 point to rough comparability of the relative importance of these issues for men and

 women, the percentages in Table Two reflect notable differences between the

 proportion of men and women who felt various issues were "most important" in the

 campaign. Amongst the domestic issues, the greatest disparities were for education,

 health, the GST, and the environment, with a greater proportion of women than men

 viewing each issue as "most important." Amongst security issues, the sharpest

 difference in their perceived importance was for terrorism — 64.4% of those citing

 terrorism as the most important being women, while only 35.6% were men. Smaller,

 but notable, differences are also evident in men's and women's estimations of the

 importance of the refugees and asylum-seekers issue and the defence and national

 Page 9

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 security issue; in both cases, a greater proportion of those citing the issue as most

 important were women.

 Overall, then, women were more likely than men to view four domestic and

 three security issues as "most important" (while men were more likely than women

 to view taxation, worker entitlements, industrial relations, unemployment and

 immigration as most important). These seven issues, each of which reflects high

 levels of salience for women than for men, can be seen as tapping fundamentally

 different policy priorities linked in fundamentally different ways to the campaign

 appeals of the Liberal-National Coalition and the Labor Opposition. As a

 consequence, we would expect these two sets of issues to have distinctly different

 electoral implications for the two genders, and the potential for sharply different

 effects by women's age, as hypothesized above (H3).

 Specifying a Multivariate Model of Gender Effects on Political Preferences

 The multivariate analysis that follows focuses on the three security and four

 domestic issues above, which, as we have seen, women are more likely than men to

 view as important in their political preferences. The combined, averaged perceptions

 of the importance of the two groups of issues in respondents' vote choice are used as

 the two key independent measures: terrorism, national security and defence, and

 refugees and asylum-seekers (TERR3AVG); education, the environment, the GST,

 and health (DOM4AVG) (see Appendix for details on all variables, measures and

 scales used). Each multivariate model, below, controls for an identical set of other

 factors' that can be expected to influence voters' issue assessments, leader

 evaluations and vote decision-making. These include terms for Coalition party

 identification (COPARID), the respondent's age (AGE), the respondent's level of

 education (HIGHEDUC), a dummy variable for union membership (UNION), and a

 variable to control for respondent unemployment (UNEMP).

 -- Interaction Effects Terms

 Because gender and the political issue orientations that have increasingly

 distinguished men and women can be seen as having both direct and indirect effects

 Page 10

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 on individuals' political preferences, each multivariate model is presented in two

 forms. The first model includes terms only for the direct effect of gender (FEMALE)

 and terms for the direct effects of the 3-grouped security issues (TERR3AVG) and the

 4-grouped domestic issues (DOM4AVG). The second model includes, in addition, an

 interaction term, which allows the measurement of the differential effects of issue

 evaluations for men and for women. In these models, the coefficient for the main

 effect (either TERR3AVG or DOM4AVG) reports the regression slope estimate for the

 excluded group: men. The interaction term (FEMTERR3 or FEMDOM4), when

 added to the coefficient for the main effects variable, reports the regression slope

 estimate for women (see Appendix for a more detailed discussion).

 Gender and Issues: Effects on Leader Evaluations

 Because the Prime Minister, John Howard, built the Coalition's campaign

 appeals primarily around the theme of border protection — the combined national

 security priority of addressing the threats of terrorism and asylum seekers — those

 who viewed the three security issues as highly important in their vote choice are

 anticipated to give Mr. Howard positive evaluations. At the same time, given the

 predominant focus on domestic issues by the Labor leader, Kim Beazley is

 anticipated to secure positive leader evaluations from respondents who rank the four

 domestic issues as extremely important in their vote decision-making.

 Table Three presents four regression models. Model One tests the

 [Table Three About Here]

 direct effects of gender and the three security issues on leader evaluations of John

 Howard. Model Two includes an interaction term to test the interactive effects of

 gender and security issues on evaluations for Mr. Howard. Model Three measures

 the direct effects of gender and the four domestic issues on evaluations of Labor

 leader, Kim Beazley, while Model Four includes an interaction term for the

 interactive effects of gender and concern for domestic issues on evaluations for Mr.

 Beazley.

 Page 11

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 In Model One, we see that women (FEMALE) were insignificantly less likely

 than men to assign positive evaluations to John Howard. At the same time, however,

 those who viewed the three security issues (TERR3AVG) as important in their vote

 decision-making were significantly more likely to assign strong leader evaluations to

 Mr. Howard than those who viewed these security issues as less important. As the

 model includes a control for Coalition party ID (COPARID) this effect must be seen

 as independent of the favourable effects for the party's main banner carrier, evident

 amongst Liberal and National partisans. Clearly, as suggested above, John Howard

 reaped significant evaluative rewards from voters on the basis of security issues.

 At the same time, those who viewed the four domestic issues (DOM4AVG) as

 important in their vote choice, were significantly less likely to give the Prime

 Minister high leader evaluation marks than those who viewed these issues as of

 lower importance. The only other significant factor predicting positive evaluations

 of Mr. Howard is respondent's age (AGE) — older respondents significantly more

 likely than their younger counterparts to evaluate Mr. Howard positively.

 In Model Two, we see that men who view security issues as important

 (TERR3AVG) hold significantly stronger evaluations of Mr. Howard than men who

 viewed these issues as of lower importance. However, women who viewed security

 issues as important in their vote choice (FEMTERR3) were significantly more likely

 than their male counterparts to assign positive scores to Mr. Howard. In short,

 though gender as a direct effect (Model One) was an insignificant direct predictor of

 leader evaluations of the Prime Minister, it has a significant impact in tandem with

 estimations of security issues in promoting positive evaluations of the conservative

 leader. All told, then, while both men and women who view security issues as

 important exhibited significant, positive effects on the likelihood of supporting Mr.

 Howard, women translated these issues into significantly higher evaluations than

 did men.

 Models Three and Four show a nearly mirror-opposite set of effects for the

 impact of gender and concern for the four domestic issues on leader evaluations for

 Labor leader, Kim Beazley. Model Three shows that gender had an insignificant

 Page 12

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 direct effect on evaluations for Beazley while, as anticipated, the direct effects for the

 three security issues and the four domestic issues perfectly reverse the effects seen in

 Models One and Two, predicting support for Mr. Howard. In Model Four, we see

 that men who viewed the four domestic issues as important in their vote choice

 (DOM4AVG) were significantly more likely to view Mr. Beazley positively, while

 women (FEMDOM4) who viewed domestic issues as important, were insignificantly

 more likely than men to view Beazley favourably. We also see that older

 respondents (AGE) held stronger evaluations of Mr. Beazley — as they did of Mr.

 Howard — while those with university educations (HIGHEDUC) and union

 memberships (UNION) gave significantly higher evaluations to Mr. Beazley than did

 their non-university educated and non-union counterparts.

 Overall, the patterns in Table Three suggests the impact of gender in leader

 evaluations in the 2001 Australian election was primarily indirect, as a significant

 boost by female voters for the impact of security concerns on support for Mr.

 Howard, and as an insignificant, but clear cut boost by female voters on positive

 evaluations for Mr. Beazley. In short, the simultaneous salience for both issue

 agendas, seen in Table Two, assumes an important role in propelling women's

 political preferences in distinct patterns of support for the two major party

 alternatives.

 Gender and Issues: Effects on Support for the War on Terrorism

 During the 2001 election campaign, Prime Minister Howard announced

 Australia would contribute military assistance to an American-led operation against

 the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, and signalled the country's commitment to an

 ongoing involvement in the war on terrorism. Table Four examines the impact of

 gender and of security and domestic

 [Table Four About Here]

 issues on support for this most controversial security policy that emerged during the

 campaign. It does so, as with Table Three, by presenting a model that includes only

 direct effects for gender and issue evaluations (Model One), as well as models that

 Page 13

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 include interaction terms for gender*security issues (Model Two) and

 gender*domestic issues (Model Three).

 In Model One, we see that women (FEMALE) were significantly less likely

 than men to support Australia's involvement in the war on terrorism — confirming

 the long-established pattern of women's opposition to force and war (see Hypothesis

 H2, p. 6). At the same time, as expected, those who cited the three security issues as

 highly important in their vote choices (TERR3AVG) were significantly more likely to

 support the war on terrorism, while those who cited their importance of the four

 domestic issues (DOM4AVG) were significantly less likely to support the war on

 terrorism.

 Model Two's introduction of a gender*security issues interaction term

 (FEMTERR3), as in Table Three, yields a pattern in which women who are concerned

 with security issues are significantly more likely than their male counterparts

 (TERR3AVG) to support the war on terror — in this case, despite the direct, negative

 effect for women seen in Model One. Model Three measures the effects of the

 interaction between gender and domestic issues on support for the war on terror.

 Here, we see that men who viewed domestic issues as highly important in their vote

 (DOM4AVG) were significantly less likely to view support involvement in the war

 on terror. Women who cited the importance of these domestic issues (FEMDOM4),

 however, were insignificantly less likely than men to oppose support for the war on

 terror. In short, the affirmation of the importance of domestic issues meant that both

 men and women were more likely to oppose the war on terror.

 Clearly, the ranks of female respondents contain strongly felt, salient concerns

 for both security issues and domestic issues. Women are distinctively different from

 men only amongst those expressing the importance of security issues — for whom we

 see a significant boost over the significant, positive effect amongst men for the

 likelihood of supporting military involvement in the war on terrorism.

 Gender and Issues: Effects on the Vote for the Coalition

 Table Five examines vote choice for the Coalition — in the first two

 Page 14

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 [Table Five About Here]

 models as the product of security issue concerns, and in the last two models as the

 product of domestic issue concerns. As in Tables Three and Four, above, direct

 effects models are presented (Models One and Three) in addition to models with the

 inclusion of interaction terms (Models Two and Four).

 In Model One, we see that women (FEMALE) are insignificantly less likely

 than men to vote Coalition. Echoing the overall decline in the voting gender gap

 across recent Australian elections (see Figure 1, above) thee was no significant

 conservative bias evident in women's House votes in the 2001 election. At the same

 time, as expected, the direct effects for the three security issues (TERR3AVG) and for

 the four domestic issues (DOM4AVG) yield significant, and opposite effects — the

 former, significantly predicting a Coalition vote; the latter, a significant predictor of a

 vote against the Coalition.

 In Model Two, however, echoing the patterns for the interaction terms in

 Tables Three and Four above, women who are concerned about security issues

 (FEMTERR3) are significantly more likely than men who cited the importance of

 security issues (TERR3AVG) to cast votes for the Liberal-National Coalition. While

 both men and women who rated security issues as highly important in their vote

 choice can be seen as significantly more likely to vote Coalition than those who rated

 these issues with lower importance, women were significantly more likely than men

 to do so.

 In Model Four, we see that women who cited the four domestic issues as

 important in their vote choice (FEMDOM4) were insignificantly less likely than their

 male counterparts to vote against the Coalition. In short, both men and women who

 cited the importance of the four domestic issues in their vote choice were

 significantly more likely to vote against the Coalition than those who viewed those

 issues as of lower importance in their vote decision-making — gender, then,

 representing an insignificant mediator of those issue effects.

 Page 15

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 All told, the patterns in Table Five suggest that while there is no appreciable

 direct effect for gender in vote preferences, when men's and women's issue

 orientations are considered — especially those involving security concerns — a

 conservative distinctiveness emerges for women. At the same time, however,

 women whose concerns are those of domestic issues exhibit a significant rise in the

 likelihood of voting against the Coalition — disparate conservative and progressive

 patterns we will revisit in detail below.

 Gender and Issues: Effects on Vote Switching

 Vote switchers, like late deciders, have long been argued to represent a key to

 electoral outcomes, as their equivocation often signals a susceptibility to campaign-period issue appeals (see Denemark, 2002). The 2001 election, with its 11 t -hour set of

 high profile security issues confronted voters with new, salient concerns of

 disproportionate benefit to the Coalition government. At the same time, a raft of

 ongoing policy domestic frustrations presented voters with an impetus to switch to

 an opposition party. Table Six applies the direct effects and interaction effects

 models

 [Table Six About Here]

 used in Tables Three, Four, and Five above to the calculus of vote switching in the

 2001 election. The direct effects of gender and of security and domestic issue

 concerns in Model One show that women were insignificantly less likely than men to

 switch to the Coalition than men. However, as anticipated, those who viewed

 security issues as important in their vote choice were significantly more likely to

 switch to the Coalition, while those who cited the importance of domestic issues in

 their vote decision-making were significantly more likely to vote against the

 Coalition.

 Models Two and Four introduce interaction terms for the effects of gender and

 security issues, and of gender and domestic issues, respectively. In Model Two we

 see there is no significance for the interaction of gender and security issues concerns.

 Men (TERR3AVG) exhibit a positive, but insignificantly greater likelihood of

 Page 16

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 switching to the Coalition on the basis of security issue concerns, while women

 (FEMTERR3) were insignificantly more likely than men to switch their votes to the

 Coalition. Clearly, unlike the more sharply drawn interaction effects of gender and

 security concerns in predicting Coalition voting (see Table Five) vote switching due

 to the impact of security issues was not appreciably gender-specific. At the same

 time, however, Model Four shows that women (FEMDOM4) were significantly more

 likely than men (DOM4AVG) to switch away from the Coalition if they cited the four

 domestic issue concerns as important in their vote choice. 1° Overall, then, to the

 extent there was a gender gap amongst vote switchers in the 2001 election, it was on

 the basis of domestic issue concerns away from the Coalition.

 Differentiating the Relative Impact of Security and Domestic Issues

 One of the patterns most evident in the tables above is the salience felt by

 women for two sets of issue concerns that strongly predict support for two different

 parties. In the aggregate, the political impact of the relative importance of the two

 issue orientations remains obscure. This can be seen in Table Seven, which reports

 the mean scores for men and women, for the three

 [Table Seven About here]

 combined security issues, the four combined domestic issues, and for the relative

 importance of these two sets of issues (security — domestic). Clearly apparent is the

 significantly higher salience felt by women for both security and domestic issues.

 And yet, the relative importance of these two sets of issues shows no difference

 between the genders.

 One way to tease out the contradictory currents of these two sets of issue

 concerns is to examine the political preferences of men and women across the range

 of scores for the relative importance of security and domestic issues. To do this, as

 discussed above, a variable was created by subtracting the average score for the four

 domestic issues from the average score for the three security issues. Then, a score

 was calculated that separated the top 20% of scores (those with the highest scores,

 and viewed security issues as more important than domestic issues in their vote

 Page 17

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 choice) and the bottom 20% (those who had the lowest scores, and viewed domestic

 issues as more important than security issues. See Appendix for details). Table Eight

 reports the proportion of respondents voting Coalition, and switching to the

 [Table Eight About Here]

 Coalition, for those in these top and bottom quintiles of security vs. domestic issue

 scores.

 Evident in the top half of the table, which reports Coalition voting, is a

 simultaneous conservative and progressive gender gap for respondents feeling the

 strongest about security issues and about domestic issues in their vote choice. 81.6%

 of women who scored in the top 20% of scores voted for the Coalition, while only

 72.5% of their male counterparts did — a 9.1% conservative gap. At the other end of

 the spectrum — those who scored in the bottom 20% and viewed the four domestic

 issues as more important than the three security issues — 82.1% of women voted

 against the Coalition, while only 74.7% of men did — a 7.4% progressive  ssive gap. In

 short, amongst the men and women who felt most strongly about security and about

 domestic issues, women were the most likely to translate that issue salience into a

 vote for the Coalition, and against the Coalition, respectively — thus, sustaining a

 simultaneous conservative and progressive gender gap.

 The bottom half of Table Eight reports an equivalent set of factors for vote

 switching to and from the Coalition. Here, as suggested in the multivariate analysis

 in Table Six above, women who scored in the top 20% of security vs. domestic issues

 were only .4% more likely to switch to the Coalition than their male counterparts.

 For respondents in the bottom 20% of security vs. domestic issue scores, however, we

 see women were far more likely than their male counterparts to vote against the

 Coalition — 68.4% and 44.8%, respectively.

 All told, the patterns in Table Eight confirm a dichotomous, conservative-progressive gender gap in 2001, fuelled primarily by those most fervent in their issue

 orientations. While security issues seemed to have played a vital role in confirming

 votes for the Coalition, domestic issues appear equally to have done so for the

 Page 18

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 Opposition. But, perhaps more tellingly, amongst vote switchers, women were more

 likely to vote Opposition if they were most concerned about domestic issues — and, as

 Table One showed, a larger share of voters viewed domestic issues as the most

 important concerns during the campaign."

 Age, Education and the Dichotomous Gender Gap

 As outlined in hypothesis H2, above, women's socio-economic, hence political,

 distinctiveness is widely thought to be dissipating across time due to the replacement

 of older, less educated, conservative women by younger, more educated, progressive

 women. Thus, one explanation for the dichotomous conservative/progressive gender

 gap seen throughout, but especially in the most fervently-felt top and bottom

 quintiles of those issue orientations, would be an educational and age distinctiveness

 of the women who hold those disparate political preferences. Table Nine reports the

 mean

 [Table Nine About Here]

 age and university education for men and women in the top 20% and bottom 20%,

 and the remaining 80% of the security vs. domestic issue scores. In the top half of the

 tale, which reports the average age for these groups of individuals, we see the

 average age of women in the top 20% who cited security issues as most important

 was 50.7, while the average age for the other 80% of women was 45.5 — a difference of

 5.2 years. While men who viewed security issues as most important in their vote

 choice were also older than the remaining 80% of men (51.7 vs. 47.6) the age gap was

 slightly narrower — 4.1 years. At the other end of the issue spectrum, we see that the

 average age of women who viewed domestic issues as most important was 43.0

 years, as opposed to 47.4 for the remaining 80%. But, men, if anything, had a wider

 age disparity — 43.8 years vs. 50.0 years. In short, the figures confirm that those who

 viewed security issues as most important in their vote choice were significantly older

 than the remainder of the voting population — the age gap for women exceeding that

 for men. However, amongst those who viewed domestic issues as most important, if

 Page 19

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 anything, women were only slightly younger — and the age gap narrower than for

 their male counterparts.

 The second half of the Table Nine reports the mean university education of

 those citing these two sets of issues as important in their vote choice (Note: as the

 variable is a dummy variable, the mean is also the percentage of those with any

 university education). Here, perhaps stronger than in the age patterns above, one

 sees that 12.8% of women who viewed security issues as most important had some

 university education — as opposed to 23.7% of the remaining 80% if women.

 Amongst men, the pattern is similar, but less sharply drawn - 15.1% vs. 22.5%. At

 the other end of the spectrum, amongst those citing domestic issues as most

 important, we see that both men and women in the bottom 20% were significantly

 more likely to have a university education than the remaining 80% of the population

 — the gap slightly larger amongst men.

 Overall, the demographic patterns in Table Nine confirm suspicions that, at

 least in part, women's disparate conservative and progressive political preferences

 are the product of the age and educational characteristics of those with the most

 fervently held issue orientations. Nonetheless, because youth and university

 education are important predictors of more progressive politics for both men and

 women, the additive gender gap — both conservative and progressive — seen in Table

 Eight points to an important, gender-specific salience for both realms of issue

 concerns.

 Conclusion

 The 2001 Australian election, by confronting female voters with distinct

 security and domestic issue domains and the electoral alternatives they afforded,

 provides a valuable opportunity to examine a number of assumptions about the

 electoral gender gap, and the extent to which it can be seen as premised on distinctly

 conservative or progressive political preferences, grounded in these issue concerns.

 The results, overall, support hypothesis H3 and Norris' (1996) British findings,

 by pointing to the aggregation of women as sustaining within their ranks two

 Page 20

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 distinctly different issue orientations — promoting, especially amongst those who

 most fervently hold either security or domestic issue concerns, polar opposite

 political preferences. On the one hand, a decidedly conservative gender gap can be

 seen amongst those who cite the importance of security issues in their vote decision

 making, with women significantly more likely than their male counterparts to assign

 positive evaluations for the Coalition leader, to support the war on terrorism, and to

 vote Coalition. On the other hand, however, women who cited domestic issues as

 most important in their vote calculus exhibited decidedly progressive preferences -though, for the most part, this was not significantly different from the equivalent

 progressive orientation of their male counterparts. In short, while a sharply

 distinctive conservatism can be seen in women's security concerns in the 2001

 Australian election, it is countered by a nearly equivalent pattern of progressive

 preferences on the basis of domestic issue concerns. Australian women, then,

 echoing several of the patterns of emergent "security moms" in the USA, manifested

 a clear cut salience for security issues and used those orientations to guide

 conservative policy support, leader evaluations and vote choices, while the ranks of

 women voters also exhibited ongoing concerns for a variety of domestic issues that

 led other women to use domestic policies to guide their issue assessments and leader

 evaluations, and to decide their votes for the opposition. Women's electoral politics

 in Australia, then, are fundamentally riven by these two disparate sets of preferences.

 Parties that build their strategic fortunes on a homogeneous new conservatism and

 militarism for women's politics seem destined for electoral disaster.

 These patterns have important theoretical and practical implications with

 respect to the nature of the gender gap and its longer term electoral effects. By

 examining in detail the relative importance of security and domestic issue

 orientations, one sees that the disparate conservative and progressive orientations

 harboured within the ranks of female voters reflect significantly different age and

 educational characteristics. Those women who sustained a distinct conservatism

 built on security concerns were considerably older and less educated than those

 women exuding a progressive orientation, build on domestic issue concerns. While

 Page 21

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 the younger cohort can be expected to mature into more conservative orientations

 across time — as is typical in the political life cycle — the high levels of university

 education in the ranks of younger, more progressive women point to an emergent

 and more resilient progressive politics that may indeed spell the demise of the once-dominant conservative gender gap. If so, then despite the emotive power of the

 events of 9/11 and the asylum seeker incidents, the Australian 2001 election may be

 significant not for forging a new conservative primacy in women's politics, but rather

 for signalling a resolute, progressive cast to women's ongoing concerns for

 education, health and the environment — even in the age of terrorism.

 Interaction Models

 FEMALE In models including an interaction term (FEMTERR3 or FEMDOM4), the coefficient for this dummy variable, when added to the coefficient for CONSTANT produces a y-axis intercept for those respondents coded 1

 Page 27

 David Denemark: Terrorism, Security and the Gender Gap in Australian Politics

 (women). The coefficient for the model's CONSTANT is the y-axis intercept

 for the excluded group: men.

 TERR3AVG In models including the interaction term FEMTERR3 this continuous variable produces a regression slope estimate for the effect of the three security issues for the excluded group: men.

 DOM4AVG In models including the interaction term FEMDOM4 this continuous variable produces a regression slope estimate for the effect of the four domestic issues for the excluded group: men.

 FEMTERR3 An interaction term (FEMALE*TERR3AVG) for the effects of TERR3AVG for women. This term produces a regression slope estimate for the effects of the 3 security issues for female respondents (those scored 1 in FEMALE).

 FEMDOM4 An interaction term (FEMALE*DOM4AVG) for the effects of DOM4AVG for women. This term produces a regression slope estimate for the effects of the 4 domestic issues for female respondents (those scored 1 in FEMALE).

 Differentiating Respondents' Evaluations of Security and Domestic Issues

 TRDMDIF A continuous variable measuring the difference between the averaged importance of the three security issues (TERR3AVG) and the four domestic security issues (DOM4AVG) in respondents' vote decision. Positive values = security issues were more important than domestic issues; negative values = domestic issues were more important than security issues (range —2.0 to +2.0).

 FMTRRAD A dummy variable for the top 20% (positive scores) of female respondents in the distribution of the scores for TRDMDIF. A frequency was run of TRDMDIF and the score noted that would differentiate the top 20% of female respondents (+.42) from the remaining 80%: 1= top 20% of these averaged scores; 0=remaining 80%.

 MLTRRAD A dummy variable for the top 20% (positive scores) of male respondents in the distribution of the scores for TRDMDIF. A frequency was run of TRDMDIF and the score noted that would differentiate the top 20% of male respondents (+.42) from the remaining 80%: 1= top 20% of these averaged scores; 0=remaining 80%.

 FMDMRAD A dummy variable for the bottom 20% (negative scores) of female respondents in the distribution of the scores for TRDMDIF. A frequency was run of TRDMDIF and the score noted that would differentiate the bottom 20%

 Page 28

 of female respondents (-.67) from the remaining 80%: 1= bottom 20% of these

 averaged scores; 0=remaining 80%.

 MLDMRAD A dummy variable for the bottom 20% (negative scores) of male respondents in the distribution of the scores for TRDMDIF. A frequency was run of TRDMDIF and the score noted that would differentiate the bottom 20% of male respondents (-.67) from the remaining 80%: 1= bottom 20% of these averaged scores; 0=remaining 80%.

 Demographics

 FEMALE A dummy variable for respondent's gender: 1 = female; 0= male (I1)

 AGE A continuous variable for respondent's age. (I2)

 HIGHEDUC A dummy variable for respondent's level of education: 1= post-graduate degree or diploma, bachelor degree, or undergraduate diploma; 0 = no qualification since leaving school, trade qualification, or non-trade qualification. (H3)

 UNION A dummy variable for respondent's union membership: 1= union member; 0= not a union member. (H6)

 UNEMP A dummy variable for respondent's unemployment: 1= unemployed; 0= not unemployed. (H4)

 Endnotes

 ' The Tampa asylum-seeker incident involved a Norwegian container ship that rescued 430 mainly Afghan asylum-seekers after their boat sank on the way to Australia. Because the sinking occurred in Indonesian waters the Australian government refused the Tampa permission to land on Australia's Christmas Island, where the ship's captain had gone to offload the refugees. In the end, the standoff was resolved only after New Zealand agreed to take 150 of the 430, and the tiny Pacific island of Nauru had agreed to accommodate the others, pending decisions on their appeals for political asylum. 2 The November, 2002 mid-term elections saw George Bush become the first Republican president in over one hundred years to see gains for his party in an off-year (non-presidential) election (Tumulty and Novak, 2003: 2). 3 Australian voters, clearly, had several other party alternatives in the 2001 election, the highest profile being the Democrats, Greens, and the One Nation Party. Australia's Alternative Vote system in the House of Representatives, however, effectively rules out the election of other parties' candidates

 (only three independents and no members of minor parties, other than National, were elected to the House in 2001 (Mackerras, 2002: 289)). As the House is responsible for forming the government, and leaders of the Coalition and ALP dominated both the TV news coverage, were the only participants in the nationally-televised leaders debate on 14 October, and dominated published polls on "the most preferred prime minister (see Coot, 2002: 77-78) the empirical analysis below focuses on House vote, the Coalition and ALP leaders, and Coalition vs. non-Coalition vote. NB: Content analysis of TV coverage on the ABC and Channel 9 evening news bulletins in Perth (as part of a 2003 Australian Research Council Discovery Grant with Clive Bean and Ian Ward) shows that the two major party leaders attracted 93% of ABC TV campaign news coverage (calculated as raw seconds of TV time weighted by prominence in the news bulletin). At the same time, National Party leader John Anderson, Democrats leader, Natasha Stott-Despoja, Greens leader, Bob Brown and the One Nation Party leader, Pauline Hanson, combined, received only 7% of ABC TV coverage. Virtually identical patterns apply for Channel 9's evening news bulletin coverage of the party leaders. The minor parties themselves fared little better: the Coalition and Labor garnering 82% of the coverage on the ABC while the Democrats, Greens, One Nation and Independents, combined, totalled 17%. Channel 9 in Perth devoted 92.7% of its campaign news coverage to the Coalition and ALP, but only about 7.2%, combined, to all other parties and independents. Graphs of these patterns are available from the

 author via email upon request. 4 Warhurst argues that Labor's ceding of international issues to the Coalition meant it was "left to the Greens and Democrats to offer an alternative view on the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers that appealed to critics of Government action" (2002: 12). However, as detailed in footnote 3 above, neither the minor parties nor their leaders were able in a substantial way to present their case to the electorate. 5 The survey dataset utilized in this paper is the 2001 Australian Election Study (Bean, McAllister and Cow, 2001), a self-completion survey of the Australian electorate, conducted in the weeks following the 2001 federal election. 6 De Vaus and McAllister note, however that at least some of this conservative bias can be attributed to the overall left-wing orientation of the political spectrum, within which women are relatively more conservative than men (1989: 249). 7 Norris (1996: 338), who also used 1993 Australian election data, found comparable evidence of a conservative gender gap in that election. 8 De Vaus and McAllister (1989: 254-5), for example, argue "as more women enter the workforce and become exposed to the secularising forces of modern society, so their politics will change. Although the structural and situational changes would take decades rather than years to occur, they demonstrate the potential electoral benefits parties of the left might expect to reap in future years." 9 Table 5 is the one exception. It uses a dummy variable for strength of party identification

 (STRNGIDZ)instead of the dummy variable for Coalition partisanship (COPARID), which appears in the other multivariate models. This was done because Table 5's model predicts vote switching to the Coalition, which I assumed to be virtually a contradiction in terms with partisanship, while respondents with weak IDs might be expected to exhibit differential rates of vote switching from those with stronger levels of party identification. 10 See the discussion on age and vote switching on p.19, and in footnote 11, below.

 11 One possible explanation for the differential likelihood of voting and vote switching to reflect security concerns involves the role of respondent age in political preferences and behaviour, discussed next. Security concerns were felt sharpest by older respondents, while domestic concerns were felt most sharply by younger respondents. In turn, older respondents are far-less likely than their younger counterparts to switch their votes from election to election (the average age of switchers was 44.53; of non-switchers, 49.65 - in part, it seems likely, due to more resilient vote loyalties established

 across the voters' lifetimes. Applying an independent samples test, assuming unequal variances, a t-value of 5.670 is obtained, with 2-tailed significance of .000). In short, older voters with conservative issue orientations are drawn from the ranks of voters who are least likely to switch votes.
