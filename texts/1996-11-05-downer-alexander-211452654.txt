  DEVELOPMENTS IN ZAIRE 

  Jib ....ll. AUSTRALIA,J "~"ªª~(´<

  The three week ceasefire declared unilaterally by the alliance of Tutsi' rebels is an encouraging  development in the current situation in Zaire. It may at least temporarily put an end to fighting  and provide international relief agencies with a window of opportunity for access to the  hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons stranded in Zaire. 

  While one offer of a ceasefire is not a permanent solution, we welcome any steps that will  enable aid agencies to take the necessary measures to alleviate the suffering of the refugees. 

  We hope that Zaire will cooperate in implementing the ceasefire . 

  The African regional heads of government meeting is taking place in Nairobi today. A  negotiated settlement by all the countries in the region would be by far the best outcome. 

  We remain concerned however, that Zaire has said it will not participate in any regional talks  as long as it believes that Rwanda is supplying arms to the rebels and as long as Rwanda  occupies Zairean territory. 

  We would strongly encourage Zaire to participate in such regional initiatives. 

  The Director General of AusAID, Mr Trevor Kanaley, is currently in Ethiopia inspecting  Australian aid activities . I have asked him to proceed to Nairobi for discussions with  international agency officials coordinating the emergency response to the crisis. 

  He will report back to me on the ways in which Australian aid can best be used. 

  I expect the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs to issue a consolidated appeal on behalf  of all UN agencies as soon as a needs assessment has been completed. The Australian  Government stands ready to make a contribution to the appeal as soon as possible after that. 

  As well, as I announced in Parliament last Thursday, the Government will also be considering  the Rapid Response Assistance Proposals submitted by Australian NGOs .

  History of Australian Assistance for the Great Lakes Region 

  The genocide in Rwanda in 1994 created massive problems in the Great Lakes region  of Africa. One of the most significant was the enormous number of refugees who fled the  conflict. The total refugee population in the Great Lakes region prior to the current crisis  was estimated â‘ at 1. 9 million. 

  Australia was an early and significant donor to emergency appeals in the Great Lakes  region. Since November 1993, AusAID has provided $20.6 million. These funds were  channelled through Australian NGOs and multilateral institutions. 

  Two Australian Defence Force medical contingents were provided at a cost of $22.5  million. 

  $30 million was contributed by the Australian public to Australian NGOs . 

  The focus of recent humanitarian assistance has been on programs which encourage the  voluntary repatriation of refugees to Rwanda . In 1995-96 Australia gave $7.2 million ,  largely for the rehabilitation of health and water services in Rwanda . Aid was also  provided for human rights monitors, resettlement programs and support for  unaccompanied children . 

  Contributions were also made to diplomatic initiatives : $25 000 to the Julius Nyerere  initiative ; $100 000 to peace initiatives associated with the Organisation of African Unity;  and $100 000 to the International Peace Academy Conflict Management in Africa  Program. 

  Current Situation 

  All international relief workers have been evacuated from Zaire, leaving well over a  million refugees and up to three-quarters of a million Zaireans without access to  international assistance . However, both multilateral and non-government agencies are  positioning themselves to move back into Zaire. 

  The three week ceasefire declared by the alliance of Tutsi rebels is an encouraging  development which may allow access to the Rwandan refugees and Zairean displaced  people currently cut off from humanitarian assistance . 

  The Director General of AusAlD , Mr Trevor Kanaley, is currently in Ethiopia,  inspecting Australian aid activities . He has been instructed to proceed to Nairobi for  discussions with international agency officials coordinating the emergency response to the  cnsls. 

  Australian NGOs have until COB Thursday 7 November to submit their Rapid  Response Assistance Proposals to AusAID. 

  [t is also expected that the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs (which has  responsibility for coordinating UN efforts in emergencies) will issue a consolidated  emergency appeal on behalf of all UN agencies, as soon as a needs assessment has been  completed. Australia will determine its contribution to that appeal as soon as possible  after that.
