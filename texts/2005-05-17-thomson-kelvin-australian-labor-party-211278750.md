 MINISTER MCGAURAN OWNS UP TO LACK OF AFFORDABLE  HOUSING   

 

 Minister Peter McGauran has today offered empty platitudes to employers unable  to attract skilled migrants to the Swan Hill area by calling on landlords and  developers to build more affordable housing in the district. 

 

 He went on to state ‘there are particular problems for a number of Sudanese  refugees who are available to come, have very large families, six, seven, eight  children and there’s little public housing.”   

 Minister McGauran should have owned up to the Swan Hill community that the  lack of local affordable housing is a direct result of years of funding neglect of  housing programs throughout their term of office.   

 Minister McGauran has a cheek to stand in rural Victoria and bemoan the fact  there is limited public housing available.   

 These comments are highly insensitive in light of the Howard Government’s  years of funding neglect for public housing.   

 Last week’s Federal Budget made no move to reverse the $760 million  cumulative real reduction in Commonwealth State Housing Agreement (CSHA)  payments during this period.   

 This equates to an additional 5,000 homes that have not been built in Victoria to  meet demand for public housing.   

 Minister McGauran would do better to find his voice in Federal Cabinet to support  the housing sector’s calls for additional funding for the CSHA and other housing  programs that have been cut by the Howard Government.
