  Territory Government’s contempt for East 
Timorese leadership

  

  Federal member for the Northern Territory, Warren Snowdon, said the 
actin g Northern Territory Chief Minister’s display of contempt 
for the leaders of a future free East Timor this morning reflected the 
lack of political vision of his Government.

  

 “It comes as no surprise to me the acting Chief 
Minister adopted this attitude,” Mr Snowdon said. “Historically 
this Government has shown no ability to strategically analyse the East 
Timor situation.

  

 “The Northern Territory Government has long been 
scathing in its criticism, and contemptuous of the people who have been 
arguing the case for independence. That appears not to have changed.

  

 “But the Northern Territory Government needs to 
wake up. A new reality has dawned on the region and the Government needs 
to comprehend it and deal with it.

  

 “Mr Reid’s contempt on ABC Radio this morning 
for the four men who arrived for a meeting with him yesterday - Joao 
Carrascalao, Jose Valdares, Jacinto Tinoco, and Alfredo Ferriera - shows 
he fails to understand the dynamic of the situation in East Timor.

  

 “Despite what the Territory Government may want, 
the CNRT represent the face of a future East Timor, as expressed by 
the 78.5 per cent vote. These refugees are here as a result of a political 
act -because they voted overwhelmingly for independence and implicitly 
for the CNRT leadership.

  

 “Let’s not confuse issues here. I think the Northern 
Territory Government is doing a fantastic job in assisting the East 
Timorese refugees following their traumatic flight from terror.

  

 “However, the acting Chief Minister fails to comprehend 
the significance of the CNRT leadership wanting to establish temporary 
headquarters in Darwin, and also wanting to personally thank the Government 
for its great work,” Mr Snowdon said.

  

 “The fact is, there will one day be a free and independent 
East Timor with its own Government, and the people the acting Chief 
Minister booted out of his office will most likely form a major part 
of that Government.

  

 “He needs to understand that the refugees he was 
mingling with while doing the interview this morning were people who 
were escaping the oppression created as a result of them voting for 
independence - and implicit in that, the likely future leadership of 
Xanana Gusmao and the CNRT.

  

 “Acting Chief Minister, the reality may be unpalatable 
to you but it is a fact. You can’t change history. What you need to 
do is comprehend it and deal with it intelligently.

  

 “You can start by contacting these men, apologising, 
organising another meeting and offering them some free office space 
to set up temporary headquarters,” Mr Snowdon said.

  

 Ends
