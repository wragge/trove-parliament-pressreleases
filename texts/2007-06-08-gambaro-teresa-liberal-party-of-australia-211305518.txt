 A finalist in the 2007 Young Queenslander of the Year Awards, former Afghan  refugee Homa Forotan, is one of 561 people who will become Australian  citizens this Sunday (10 June) at a Queensland Day citizenship ceremony in  Brisbane.

 ‘At this year’s Queensland Day Citizenship ceremony we have people from 64  nationalities who will become Australian citizens,’ she said.  

 ‘The conferees come from countries as diverse as India, South Africa, China  and Venezuela. They have seized the chance Australia offers to come and  build a new life of opportunity here, and I look forward to welcoming them as  members of our strong and culturally diverse society.’  

 ‘They will join more than 16 000 people who became citizens in Queensland  last year. Nationally, than 110 000 people from over 175 countries joined the  Australian family as citizens.’ 

 Ms Gambaro said Brisbane’s Queensland Day citizenship ceremony one of  many events being held around the state to celebrate ‘the establishment in  June 1859 of the separate identity of Queensland which we cherish today,  and which made us a strong and proud member of the new nation when the  states united at Federation in 1901.’
