 CHINESE STUDENTS

 The Prime Minister has failed to appreciate the need for  consistency on decisions relating to refugees.

 Undoubtedly the events in Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989  were tragically unique but this does not mean that all  students present in Australia on that date have a  well-founded fear of persecution in the event that they are 

 required to return to their homeland. And well-founded fear  of persecution is one of the vital international standards  for determining refugee status.

 Mr Hawke's announcement that his Government will be ;  establishing a special category of possibly 20,000 or more  refugee places to accommodate Chinese students will have a  significant impact on Australia's migration program.

 Case by case determination of Chinese student claims would  enable the Government to maintain a consistent approach  with the many other claimants both in Australia and from  abroad who may seek asylum.

 Chinese students in Australia illegally on 4 June 1989 who  may have intended to stay on in breach of our immigration  requirements and who have no history of political  involvement either in China or Australia cannot be compared  with Chinese students whose forebears were associated with  previous administrations and who have played an ongoing role 

 in striving for democracy.

 Similarly, to dismiss out of hand claims of Khmer boat  people now in Australia and applying for refugee status  without consideration of their particular circumstances does 

 the Prime Minister no credit.

 Amnesty International reports on the Hun Sen regime do not  give it a clean bill of health. Likewise, those whose  families suffered the ravages of Pol Pot might well have a  well-founded fear of persecution at the prospect of a Khmer 

 Rouge return.

 These matters can only be properly addressed case by case. The Prime Minister displays abysmal double standards.
