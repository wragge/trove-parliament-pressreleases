 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Friday, 6 March 2015    

 Abbott’s asylum boats ‘farcical, costly and dangerous’    

 The Abbott government’s reported building of wooden asylum boats, based on rickety  Indonesian fishing vessels, is farcical, the Australian Greens have said.    

 “The Abbott government has gone beyond farce,” Senator Hanson-Young said.    

 “First Tony Abbott wanted to stop the boats, then he wanted to buy the boats and now  he’s gone ahead and spent millions of dollars building the boats. What a joke.    

 “Building wooden fishing boats and then loading them up with refugees before pushing  them back out to sea is simply outrageous.    

 “The Australian government needs to fess up to the Australian people and explain just  how much they’ve spent on these ridiculous boats.    

 “There are serious safety concerns with forcing refugees onto wooden fishing boats and  then pushing them back out to sea.    

 “We should be giving protection to people who need it, not sending them back to  danger.”
