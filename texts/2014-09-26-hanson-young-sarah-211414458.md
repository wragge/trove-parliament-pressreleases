 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Friday, 26 September 2014    

 Government bullying refugees with Cambodia  deal    

 The deal between the Australian and Cambodian governments will put the lives of women and  young girls at extreme risk and should not go ahead, the Australian Greens have said.    

 “It is shameful that the Abbott government is forcing refugees to choose between cruelty on  Nauru and cruelty in Cambodia,” The Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “There is nothing optional about this deal. It’s like the bully in the schoolyard, asking if you want  a punch to the face or a kick in the guts.    

 “The cost of cruelty is extremely high and now the Australian tax payer is being signed up to an  open-ended deal with one of the most corrupt nations on Earth.    

 “The government has already blown billions on detention camps in the Pacific and now they’re  giving more tax payer dollars to Cambodia.    

 “My primary concern is for the young, unaccompanied girls on Nauru who simply won’t be safe  in Cambodia.    

 “Human rights organisations have said the incidence of rape and sexual exploitation is on the  rise in Cambodia, especially for girls and young women. The moment these girls step off the  plane, they will be put at risk.”
