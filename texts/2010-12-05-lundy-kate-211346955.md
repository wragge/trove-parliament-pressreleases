 International Volunteer Day acknowledges some  special Australians  Sunday, 05 December 2010 

 The Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Kate Lundy,  today honoured those who give their time to help newly arrived refugees settle into  the community as part of International Volunteer Day. 

 ‘Our volunteers are the lifeblood of our communities,’ Senator Lundy said. 

 ‘They are the unsung heroes who selflessly give up their time and energy to help  improve the lives of others. 

 ‘Every year, on 5 December, we celebrate International Volunteer Day to  acknowledge the work and accomplishments of some very special Australians who  volunteer their time to make a difference in our communities. 

 ‘This year we are honouring the work of those who give their time help vulnerable  people take their first steps as they build new lives in Australia. 

 ‘They're our wonderful volunteers who work to provide support to newly arrived  refugees under the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy [IHSS].’ 

 The stories of two IHSS volunteers are featured in a video tribute on YouTube,  produced by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC).  See: ImmiTV 

 The video highlights the work of these volunteers, who both play a critical role in  helping some of Australia's newest refugee arrivals to successfully settle, gain  access to services and participate effectively in the community. 

 ‘About 5.4 million Australians are involved in volunteer work each year; that's nearly  one in four people who give their time and energy to help others,’ Senator Lundy  said. 

 ‘IHSS volunteers help provide both a bridge to the community and a warm welcome  to our country. 

 ‘This day offers us the opportunity to acknowledge and thank millions of special  Australians,’ the parliamentary secretary added.
