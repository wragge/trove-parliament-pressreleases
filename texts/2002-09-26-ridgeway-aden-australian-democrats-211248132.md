 Mary Robinson-Human Rights Advocate

 The Australian Democrats today paid tribute in the Senate to the tireless and courageous work undertaken by Ms Mary Robinson who recently ended her term as United Nations’ Human Rights Commissioner.

 “Mary Robinson won the praise and respect of human rights advocates around the world for her strong, principled and consistent promotion and protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms,” said Democrats’ International Human Rights Spokesperson, Senator Aden Ridgeway.

 “She held this demanding position during a particularly unstable period in world history including the civil war and peacekeeping effort in Sierra Leone, the civil unrest and wars in the former Yugoslavia, the independence of East Timor, growing unrest in the Middle East, the attack on the World Trade Centre and the war in Afghanistan.

 “She angered Governments around the world with her criticism of human rights records, appealing to Australia to examine the human rights implications of its refugee policy especially during the Tampa incident and organising UN inspections of the Woomera detention centre.

 “She also spoke out against the mandatory detention of juveniles in Australia,” said Senator Ridgeway.

 Mary Robinson, a former president of Ireland with a strong background in human rights law, visited around 60 countries during her 5-year term, addressing concerns about the erosion of fundamental principles of civil liberty and basic human rights, including the rights of minorities and refugees.

 Mr Sergio Vieira de Mello has been appointed as the new UN Human Rights Commissioner, following his leadership of the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).
