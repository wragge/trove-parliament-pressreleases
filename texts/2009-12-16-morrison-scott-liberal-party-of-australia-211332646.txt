 LABOR ROLLS OUT THE RUDD CARPET 

 Mr Scott Morrison MP  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 The arrival of the 63rd boat carrying 51 passengers coincides with reports that all 78 asylum seekers currently in 

 Indonesia who were taken onboard the Australian ship, Oceanic Viking, have been granted refugee status by the 

 UNHCR, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today.  

 Mr Morrison said the spotlight will now be on where the 78 people are resettled, given the Prime Minister’s 

 repeated denials that any special deal was done to get them off the Oceanic Viking.  

 He said past experience has shown that only 30% of people in Indonesia granted refugee status by the United 

 Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) have ended up settling in Australia in recent years.  

 “The Australian people have learnt through experience to watch Mr Rudd’s actions and outcomes, not his words,” 

 Mr Morrison said.  

 “His assurance that no special deal was done with the 78 asylum seekers will now be tested against the process 

 of their resettlement,” he said.  

 “Having had their claims settled in just a month, with special assessors flown in, we will soon learn whether 

 Labor’s Rudd carpet will extend all the way from Indonesia to Australia.  

 “Australia does its fair share of resettlement, as we should. People who have had their asylum claims tested 

 deserve support. However, this is true for all those in these desperate situations, especially those who are unable 

 to pay to get themselves to Indonesia and are stranded in camps around the world.  

 “We cannot allow the fairness and integrity of our immigration and refugee programmes to be compromised as 

 the Rudd Government has done by offering special deals.  

 “People smugglers have seen the changes in policy and the Government’s willingness to do special deals and 

 compromise the integrity of our system. As a result they are now deciding who comes to this country.  

 “People smugglers know Labor’s actions have weakened our borders and are out to take full advantage of it.  

 “Every arrival signals another failure of the Rudd Government’s policies, actions and most of all denial. As long 

 as they refuse to admit their failings and fix the problem they have created, our borders will remain compromised 

 by Labor’s weakness,” Mr Morrison said.
