 Port Augusta Residential Housing Project

 VPS 008/2003

 Australia has a fair and generous immigration system that is both robust and well structured. 

 Detention for people who have entered this country illegally is an unfortunate but necessary part of our system. This policy was introduced by the  former Labor government and has, for the moment at least, bi-partisan support.

 However, the Government also recognises that despite our best efforts, detention is never going to be an optimal environment for children to be  accommodated.

 Today's opening of a Residential Housing Project (RHP) in Port Augusta, South Australia, is a big step forward in fulfilling the Government's  commitment to finding alternative detention arrangements for women and children.

 After months of preparation and consultation with the local community, the Port Augusta RHP is ready for the residents to move in over the next  few weeks. 

 Around 40 people will be accommodated at the RHP. Eligible women and children from detention facilities will be housed in good quality,  refurbished demountable houses on the Ellis Close site. Each house is fully self contained to enable independent living with small outdoor areas for  each house allowing a level of privacy without interfering with discreet security.

 RHPs enable women and children to live independently in family-style accommodation in a community setting, while remaining in immigration  detention. 

 Partners and other children may have daytime visits to the RHP (under escort) on a regular basis. All other visits to RHP residents will occur at the  Baxter IDF. Detainees participate in the RHP on a voluntary basis.

 There are also RHPs in Woomera and Port Hedland and the Government is exploring the option of another RHP in Sydney. The Woomera RHP  will close following a transition period for those residents who will be progressively accommodated in the Port Augusta RHP.
