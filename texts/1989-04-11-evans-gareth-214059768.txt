 MEETING WITH TREASURER-GENERAL N K O B I :

 AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE TO THF. ANC

 Speaking after meeting today with the Treasurer-General of

 the ANC, Mr Thomas N k obi, the Minister for Foreign Affairs

 and T r a d e ,  Senator Gareth E v a n s , made the following points:

 .  Australia regards the African National Congress as an 

 authentic leader of black South Africans and a crucial 

 player in resolving the tragedy of apartheid.

 .  Consistently with our longstanding and universally 

 applied policy on liberation organisations, Australia 

 does not give diplomatic recognition to the ANC, nor 

 do we give direct financial aid to the organisation 

 .either in Australia or Southern Africa.

 .  However, recognising the important and generally

 constructive role the ANC has been playing in the 

 struggle to restore democracy and equal human rights 

 to South Africa, the Australian Government has in 

 recent years provided substantial indirect aid to 

 assist the organisation, delivered primarily through 

 non-government organisations like Australian People 

 for Health, Education and Development Abroad (APHEDA).

 .  Currently authorised Australian indirect aid to the

 ANC is as follows:

 $

 AIDAB/NGQ Cooperation Program (1988-91 48,000

 including English teaching at ANC 

 refugee c a m p ,  and provision of basic 

 clothing and hygiene material for ANC 

 s c h o o l s .

 6256

 A PHEDA P r o jects (over 3 ysars) 1,047,940

 - including training (in-country and 

 in Australia) in administration and 

 manage m e n t ,  occupational health and 

 safety and agriculture.

 In-Country Scholarships (oyer 3 years') 340,000

 - for 20 ANC nominated individuals in

 a variety of disciplines. *â 

 Australian Scholarships (over 3 vears^ 1,000,000

 - for. ANC nominations for post­

 graduate studies at various Australian 

 universities.

 Farm Trainees (1988-9) 138,678

 - UNICEF/AUSTCARE project for 6 ANC 

 nominees to attend agricultural college 

 in NSW.

 Arts Training (over 3 years) 35,000

 - for 6 ANC nominees to train annually 

 at design centre in Zimbabwe.

 $ 2,609,618

 Most of these projects constitute part of the Special 

 Assistance Program to South Africans and Namibians 

 (SAPSAN), established in 1986 to assist, particularly 

 through education and training projects, South 

 Africans and Namibians who are disadvantaged by 

 apartheid: aid under SAPSAN will, on present 

 plan n i n g , total $8.8 million by June 1990.

 The SAPSAN program itself falls within the special 

 Southern Africa Aid Program, to which the Government 

 has allocated $100 million over the three-year period 

 1987-8 to 1989-90: this Program involves, as well as

 SAPSAN, nearly $75 million in bilateral aid to nine 

 Southern African countries, nearly $5 million to the 

 Southern African NGO Program, and over $12 million to 

 the Southern Africa Development Coordination 

 Conference (SADCC) Regional Program. -

 The Government will give close consideration to the 

 requests I have received today fPom Mr Nkobi for 

 $500,000 in additional emergency aid for displaced 

 Front Line States refugees, and another $500,000 in 

 education, training and income generating projects for 

 ANC settlements.  While no funds are immediately 

 available from the 1988-89 aid budget for these 

 purposes, it may be possible to generate additional 

 funds in next year's budget: b u t , unless there is a

 major increase in total discretionary aid funds 

 available (which is extremely unlikely in the present 

 tight Budgetary environment), such funds would need to 

 be found at the expense of other SAPSAN projects or by 

 way of offsets elsewhere in the Southern Africa 

 Program. The situation should clarify in this respect 

 in approximately a month's time.
