  Government’s refugee Jobsearch penalties draconian: Bartlett   

 Australian Democrat Immigration spokesperson Senator Andrew Bartlett has slammed government plans to  financially penalise refugees for failing to seek work six weeks after arriving in Australia.   

 “Far from assisting refugees establish a new life in Australia, this draconian plan will increase the risk that they  become disconnected from mainstream society,” Senator Bartlett said.   

 “This populist proposal totally ignores the circumstances refugees face when they first come to Australia.    

 “Many people have come from years in camps or situations of great trauma.  They haven’t had a chance at a  ‘normal life’ as we know it for some time.     

 “Telling them they’ll lose financial support if they don’t comply with job seeker requirements when they’ve  hardly had a chance to unpack their bags and find out what life is about in Australia is simply ludicrous.    

 “Many refugees have not only themselves to settle but their families as well.  They have to get kids into school,  find affordable and adequate housing, find out where services are located and how our society operates.   Anyone who’s ever uprooted a family knows that this can take a little time, particularly if you are learning the  language and coming to terms with a different culture.   

 “Settlement services have been whittled away and other support services dealing with trauma are less than  they should be.  Before we start dictating to refugees about their employment obligations, we need to ensure  that we give them the best start.     

 “Refugees need to be settled before they have to run the Centrelink gauntlet.   

 “No one wants to see refugees become second class citizens reliant on welfare and caught in a poverty trap.   We want them to be fully engaged members of our community, contributing to society in a productive way.   The government’s plan, however, will only put another barrier in the way to achieving this,” Senator Bartlett  concluded.
