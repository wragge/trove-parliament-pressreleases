 HEALTH CHECKS FOR REFUGEES A GOOD MOVE: NOW FOR  ASYLUM SEEKERS - AMA   

 AMA President, Dr Mukesh Haikerwal, said today the Government’s announcement of new  MBS health checks for refugees from May 2006 is a good move that would be even better if it  was extended to cover asylum seekers.   

 Dr Haikerwal said the Government’s timing of the announcement was perfect, coinciding with  the release in Melbourne of the AMA’s Position Statement on the Health Care of Asylum  Seekers and Refugees.   

 “The AMA looks forward to consulting with the Government on the detail of the new health  checks and we will be clarifying if indeed the initiative covers asylum seekers, as it should,” Dr  Haikerwal said.   

 The AMA first proposed a new Medicare health assessment item for refugees to the  Government in March 2005.  It is also contained in the AMA Federal Budget Submission,  which was lodged with Treasury on 11 November 2005.     

 Today’s AMA Position Statement states:  “To determine their specific health needs, all asylum  seekers and refugees should undergo comprehensive and timely health assessments in a  culturally appropriate manner by suitable trained medical practitioners as part of a primary  health care team.  This assessment will be used to establish ongoing care.”   

 Dr Haikerwal said he is delighted with Health Minister Tony Abbott’s timely response to the  AMA’s call for greater compassion and fairness in providing health care to refugees.   

 “This new Medicare item will allow doctors to provide specialised care for people who may  have experienced trauma and danger, been exposed to disease, or had poor or little health care  in the past,” Dr Haikerwal said.   

 “Many of these patients are unlikely to have medical records and may not speak English.   

 “Having access to proper health assessments will provide these long-suffering people a  glimmer of optimism about their futures.   

 “We must also share that optimism with asylum seekers, and Immigration Minister, Amanda  Vanstone, should amend the conditions of Bridging Visa E to give holders work rights and full  access to Medicare,” Dr Haikerwal said.
