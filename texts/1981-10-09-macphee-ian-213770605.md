 From the Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs. Hon Ian Macphee,  MP

 FURTHER REPORT ON VESSEL VT 838

 "Investigations have tended to confirm that some of'the people  who have arrived on the Vessel VT 838 at Darwin on 5 October 1981  had not lived in Vietnam for some years," the Minister for  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee, said today.

 "From 'enquiries made to date the indications are that the  arrival of VT 838 is the result of a well planned syndicate  operation to move people illegally into Australia. The operation  was apparently planned in Hong Kong and centred in Thailand," Mr Macphee said.

 "Enquiries so far also indicate that the passengers on board may  have come from Taiwan and Hong Kong and paid substantial amounts  for their passage to Australia. It appears most on board are  of ethnic Chinese origin. On arrival they said they were  Vietnamese refugees who had come directly from Vietnam hoping 

 they would be allowed to stay," Mr Macphee said.

 "Detailed investigations are continuing in Australia and overseas  Two officers .from the Royal Hong Kong Police are in Darwin to  assist in the investigations. There has long been close liaison  between Australian and Hong Kong law enforcement authorities. The Hong Kong police have great experience with the problem 

 of refugees and.illegal immigration and therefore responded  promptly to Australia's request for assistance. There is a need  for further investigations particularly to establish the identity  of those on board and this is likely to take at least several  more days. When the investigations are completed I will then 

 decide on what action is to be taken and will then call a media  conference."

 "In conclusion, I repeat that these investigations about illegal  entry to Australia have nothing to do with the review of refugee  policy. That review covers refugees from Poland and other parts  of the world as well as those from Indo-China. Moreover, that  review is in respect of the present outflow of persons and has  no relevance to persons who have already been accepted and who  have settled so successfully in Australia as refugees."
