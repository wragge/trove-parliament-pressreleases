 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling ILLEGAL BOAT ARRIVALS ON TRACK TO  REACH 25,000 THIS FINANCIAL YEAR June 16, 2013

 The latest illegal boat, with 60 people on board, comes as boat arrivals are on track to reach 25,000 for the financial year, 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border 

 Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “Over 1,500 people have arrived illegally so far this month as people continue to come by boat at a rate of more than 3,000 a 

 month,” Mr Morrison said.

 “Less than 700 further illegal arrivals this month will see the total number to have arrived by boat this financial year reach 

 25,000.

 “The records of border failure under this Labor Government just keep getting broken.

 “These staggering numbers show people smugglers will continue to exploit every day they have under this failed 

 government,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “This latest boat arrival carrying 60 people is the eleventh boat to arrive in just a week, placing an 

 enormous stain on Border Protection Command - the agency tasked with protecting our borders.

 “It is hardly surprising that the people smugglers have chosen to ramp up their activities at a time when the current Labor 

 Government are riddled with infighting and constant leadership speculation.

 “The month of June is proving to be a taxing one for the hardworking men and women of Border Protection Command, 

 particularly given Labor axed $14 million from their operating budget.

 “For as long as Labor remains in office, paralysed with leadership division, the people smugglers will remain in business and 

 the Australian people will be left with the ongoing cost, chaos and tragedy,” Mr Keenan said.
