 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling OVER 3,000 ARRIVALS THIS YEAR AS  LABOR TRIES TO HIDE FROM BOAT  FAILURE May 17, 2012

 The arrival of the latest illegal boat, with 63 people on board, means more than 3,000 people have arrived so far this year as  Minister  Bowen  refuses  to  come  clean  on  the  cost  and  extent  of  the  border  crisis  now  hitting  Australian  suburbs, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "Despite over 1,700 people arriving since Minister Bowen last released figures on illegal boat arrivals, he refuses to tell the Australian people how many boat arrivals are now in detention and how many have been released into the community on bridging visas," Mr Morrison said. 

 "The  government’s  March  update  showed  there  was  a  record  7,000  illegal  boat  arrivals  either  in  the  detention  network including community detention or out in the community on bridging visas," he said. 

 "Minister  Bowen  should  immediately  tell  the  Australian  people  how  many  illegal  boat  arrivals  are  now  being  housed  in detention including on Christmas Island which has turned into a transit lounge for boat arrivals and how many have been granted bridging visas and are being supported by Australian taxpayers in the community. 

 "Unfortunately Australia has an Immigration Minister who has given up on border protection but that doesn’t mean he can  hide from accountability for his government’s failure," Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr Keenan said: "The interception of this vessel by the Australian Federal Police so close to Cocos Island raises important questions about the circumstances of the latest illegal arrival. 

 "The AFP does not have a significant maritime capability beyond very small vessels that are not designed or capable of performing this type of interception. 

 "With  5  illegal  arrivals  in  the  last  week  and  over  3000  people  this  year,  it  is  clearly  impossible  for  Border  Protection Command to intercept vessels before they come so close to Australian territory. 

 "Severe budgets cuts by the Labor Party continue to make this difficult situation much worse. 

 "The Government must clarify what has actually happened last night and why the AFP have been placed in this situation. 

 "Specifically they must inform the Australian people â

 1. What type of vessel was used? 

 1. Why was the AFP forced to undertake this task and not Border Protection Command? 

 1. What risk assessment has been done for illegal arrivals coming to Cocos Island - both for Australian officers and the  asylum seekers? 

 1. How was it possible for an illegal arrival to essentially bump into Australian territory before being detected? 

 "Labor’s  self  induced  border  protection  crisis  has  created  huge  difficulties  for  the  AFP  and  Customs  and  Labor’s   contemptuous budget and personnel cuts have added to the degree of difficulty. 

 "But illegal arrivals bumping into Australian territory where an overstretched Border Protection Command appears to have  no presence is a dangerous new development," Mr Keenan said.
