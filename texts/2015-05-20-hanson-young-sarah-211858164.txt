 The Australian Greens   

 Media Release   

 Wednesday 20 May 2015 

 Response to the Governments so called humanitarian assistance to  Burma   “Last week the  government cut 28 million dollars of aid to Burma. A week later they  want a ‘pat on the back’ for restoring less than a quarter of that” Greens spokesperson  for Immigration Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “It’s time Australia was genuine with the humanitarian assistance we give our regional  neighbours. Australia should restore all foreign aid cuts to Burma and apply diplomatic  action focused on addressing human rights abuses against the Rohingyan people.   

 “More immediately, the government has a responsibility to assist in the search, rescue  and provision of safe haven resettlement to Rohingyan refugees stranded on boats in  our region.”
