 E&EO TRANSCRIPT  PRESS CONFERENCE  PERTH  SATURDAY, 5 SEPTEMBER 2015    

 SUBJECTS: NBN; Canning by-election; Syrian refugee crisis; Perth airport  delays    

 MATT KEOGH, LABOR CANDIDATE FOR CANNING: We’re here today with  Michelle Rowland, who is our Shadow Assistant Minister for Communications and  Alannah MacTiernan, Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Western Australia. We’ve  been holding a forum here in Armadale discussing the NBN. This is a critical piece of  infrastructure for all of Australia, in particular a concern for the people of Canning. In  Canning we are now getting a second-rate NBN system, and that’s a key concern to  people in this area. They already have difficulties with telecommunications and  internet access throughout this area, and the second-rate NBN system that is being  delivered by Mr Abbott and his government is a key concern. It’s been great to be  able to field question, talk to people about their concerns about making sure they are  getting 21st century infrastructure and not a second-rate system under this  government. It’s quite clear to me and it’s clear to people in this forum that a vote for  Tony Abbott’s candidate in this election is a vote for a second-rate NBN, and Labor  will fix that. 

   

 JOURNALIST: Is it something that is being raised with you regularly while you’re  door-knocking? Do people actually see a difference between the two parties on this  issue?    

 KEOGH: They do see a difference between Labor and Mr Abbott’s government on  this issue. In fact, it’s probably one of the clearest distinctions you can find. Labor is  committed to a 21st century system of telecommunications for this country. This is  nation-building infrastructure. Under Mr Abbott and Mr Turnbull, they have turned  back and they’re giving us a second-rate system which is not going to deliver what  people need as we move through the 21st century, as we get to the end of the mining  boom and need to be developing science and technology in this state and this area.  

   

 JOURNALIST: Were you surprised to hear some residents have problems even with  the phone lines when it rains?    

 KEOGH: I wasn’t surprised to hear that at all, I’ve known that for a long time. I  actually worked for an internet company while I was at uni and this has been a  common problem, especially in older areas with older exchanges and telephone pits.  But that really exemplifies the problem of Mr Abbott and Mr Turnbull’s approach to  the NBN. We can’t rely on the copper network as a way of delivering internet as we  move through the 21st century. We need to be getting fibre to the premise.     

 JOURNALIST: With two weeks to go until the by-election, how are you feeling about  your chances now?      

 KEOGH: It’s a close race and I’m playing to win. This is a really important election  for the people of Canning to be able to send a very strong message to Mr Abbott and  his government about their concern with his broken promises and the wrong  priorities for this country.  

   

 JOURNALIST: There’s a lot of talk about the extent of swing and the impact that  might have. Are you expecting a big swing towards Labor?    

 KEOGH: Clearly I would like a big swing towards Labor because it’s really important  for people here that they’re able to send that strong message and start getting the  services they need in this area. People are concerned about rising unemployment,  they’re concerned about cuts to their schools, they’re concerned about money being  ripped out of their hospitals. This is an opportunity for the people of Canning to send  that very strong message to the government that they don’t like what is happening  under Mr Abbott. 

   

 JOURNALIST: Labor has been promising money during this campaign whereas the  Liberals don’t seem to be promising much money. Can we expect more of that in the  next fortnight?    

 KEOGH: Labor has been out here as part of this campaign saying what we will do,  and we will continue to say what Labor will do in government to deliver for the people  in this area. 

   

 JOURNALIST: Will there be more money attached to your promises?    

 KEOGH: We’ll see as we go through the next two weeks of the campaign. I’ll hand  over to Michelle.     

 MICHELLE ROWLAND, SHADOW ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR  COMMUNICATION, SHADOW MINISTER FOR CITIZENSHIP AND  MULTICULTURALISM: Thank you. Matt is absolutely right when he talks about  there being stark differences in this key area of policy - and that is nation building,  that is infrastructure, that is the National Broadband Network. There is probably no  better policy that sets out these stark differences about how we approach the future,  how the people of Canning should be able to approach the future, than the  differences in the policies in this area. We are committed to making sure that all  Australians have equitable access to the highest quality broadband. It was standing  room only here at this forum this afternoon. I am not surprised with the number of  people who have serious concerns not only about their current telecommunications  systems, but also about their ability for themselves and their children and even their  grandchildren to be able to participate and compete in a world where around our  region we see governments that have taken the future-proofing steps and made sure  they have the highest quality broadband. I would urge voters in this by-election in  two weeks’ time - and I know the NBN is one of those sleeper issues that probably  doesn’t make the front pages much but is a vote-changer - I would urge any  undecided voters to call the Liberal candidate, to ask him what his policy, what his  government’s policies are going to be for the people of Canning, and then compare  that to what Labor and Matt Keogh have in terms of vision for the future.     

 JOURNALIST: Do you think Australia should immediately accept 20,000 Syrian  refugees?     

 ROWLAND: Two points on that. Firstly, I don’t think anyone can help being moved  by some of the humanitarian  situation we have here in terms of the vision that we  see, the terrible consequences of this conflict. I think two things should be  happening. Firstly, Australia should be giving an immediate $450 million injection to  the UNHCR. We work through the UNHCR to make sure Australia does its fair share  with its humanitarian intake program. Secondly it is Labor policy to double our  humanitarian intake for 13,500 to 27,000. This is what we should be doing. The first  step should be immediate, because as we have seen from that vision that I  mentioned, we have seen people who have been waiting to be processed in Europe  and are waiting to get out of some of these camps, which clearly, when you hear the  testimony of these unfortunate people, it is not fit habitation at the moment. They  need money, they need to make sure that the UNHCR is able to function properly. 

   

 JOURNALIST: So you think Australia should be playing a greater role to help solve  this crisis?    

 ROWLAND: Absolutely, and we can do that in those two specific areas.    

 JOURNALIST: Do you think we should accept the 20,000 refugees then?     

 ROWLAND: I think that we should be doing exactly what Labor party policy has said,  which is doubling our humanitarian intake. As to where those humanitarian intakes  are drawn from, again, we will rely on the UNHCR for that, but I would not be  surprised, at all, if the UNHCR recommends that additional amount from this conflict  region. 

   

 JOURNALIST: Have you been moved by the pictures you’ve seen and do you think  the Australian public would expect more from both sides of politics?    

 ROWLAND: It is impossible not to be moved by this and I think anyone who is a  parent - having seen some of that vision, it made me get up and get my three-year-old out of bed and give her a hug. It is impossible not to be moved. I think that public  sentiment is certainly changing the views of countries and I think that some of the  commentators have rightly pointed this out in the case of the UK. Australia should be  doing more. We should be immediately increasing, by a substantial amount, our  contribution to the UNHCR, and we should be doubling our humanitarian intake. 

   

 ALANNAH MACTIERNAN, SHADOW PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY FOR  WESTERN AUSTRALIA: On the airport - quite clearly WA is being ripped off. We’re  collecting about $120 million a year from passenger user charges to fund Customs  and the smart immigration technology. Quite clearly, with Mr Abbott’s cuts, that  money is being redirected elsewhere. It is completely unacceptable that people are  waiting up to 90 minutes at our international airport; it’s unacceptable that we have,  at any one time, as much as half of the smart technology not functioning. We’re  being ripped off here in Western Australia, and we want Mr Abbott to put those jobs  back into Customs to ensure that we can in fact clear those people through the  airport in a decent time. This has the potential to impact on our tourism industry and  it’s certainly not fair to all those West Australians who are routinely using our airport.     

 JOURNALIST: Can I also ask you about the Syrian issue and whether you think  Australia should be accepting 20,000 more refugees?    

 MACTIERNAN: I’m totally at one with Michelle. Our policy is that we have to double  our humanitarian intake and to ensure the UNHCR sets those priorities. And as  Michelle says, very very likely that the UNHCR would prioritise people coming from  Syria. Again, a stark difference. We know that we can’t solve all of the world’s  problems, but we do need to do more to pull our weight. We are a lucky country and  we can afford to take more refugees than we are currently taking.
