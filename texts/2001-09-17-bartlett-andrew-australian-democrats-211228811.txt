 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 17 September 2001  MEDIA RELEASE                          01/541

 Democrats respond to Federal Court decision The Australian Democrats vow to continue their support for Australia’s commitment to human rights, despite the Federal Court’s decision today, which threatens to extinguish Australia’s obligations to international human rights.

 Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Australian Democrats spokesperson for Immigration said, “The Democrats and all those who strive to protect the rights of others are extremely disappointed by the Federal Court’s decision, but the Democrats acknowledge and support Australia’s rule of law.

 “This decision, however, does nothing to provide a coherent and responsible solution to the ongoing problem of asylum seekers.

 “The Tampa refugees, and others seeking asylum in Australia, are currently subject to ad hoc Government policy-making on the run - political opportunism at its worse.

 “This is not the way to deal with this serious international human rights issue - it is an issue that is likely to worsen in the event of reprisal attacks upon Afghanistan’s Taliban Government,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
