 CHRIS BOWEN MP 

 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP   

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 10 September 2012 

 

 NAURU DESIGNATED FOR REGIONAL PROCESSING   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, has this morning signed the  legislative instrument designating the Republic of Nauru as a regional processing country  under the Migration Act.   

 “I will today table the designation documents in Parliament. Subject to both houses passing  a resolution approving the designation, the designation will allow for the transfer of irregular  maritime arrivals who arrived after 13 August to Nauru,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “These documents outline the terms of agreement with the Nauruan Government and the  fact I have now designated Nauru as a regional processing country.”   

 The Minister has determined that it is in the national interest to begin transferring people to  Nauru as set out in the Statement of Reasons, including:   

 â¢ Nauru has given Australia the assurances around the principle of non-refoulement  and the assessment of asylum claims in line with the Refugee Convention;  â¢ Designating Nauru as a regional processing country will discourage irregular and  dangerous maritime voyages and thereby reduce the risk of the loss of life at sea;  â¢ The designation promotes the maintenance of a fair and orderly Refugee and 

 Humanitarian Program that retains the confidence of the Australian people;  â¢ Designating Nauru as a regional processing country promotes regional cooperation  on irregular migration and people smuggling and its undesirable consequences; and  â¢ Arrangements already in place in Nauru and those that are proposed to be put in 

 place in Nauru are satisfactory.   

 The Memorandum of Understanding with the Nauruan Government was signed on 29  August. Construction work on the temporary facility is nearing completion and the  Government expects to be able to begin transferring people to Nauru later this week.   

 Mr Bowen said the Government was committed to implementing the recommendations of  the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers.   

 “The designation I have tabled today is the next step in implementing the Expert Panel’s  recommendations,” he said.   

 Further announcements about processing arrangements in Nauru will be made in due  course.   

 The Nauru Designation and Statement of Reasons are attached.

 NOTE: Subsection 198AB(1) provides that the Minister may, by legislative instrument, designate that a country is a regional  processing country. Subsection 198AB(2) provides that the only condition for the exercise of the power under subsection (1) is  that the Minister thinks that it is in the national interest to designate the country to be a regional processing country. Subsection  198AB(3) of the Act, provides that in considering the national interest for the purposes of subsection (2), the Minister: (a) must  have regard to whether or not the country has given any assurances to the effect that: (i) the country will not expel or return a  person taken to the country under section 198AD to another country where his or her life or freedom would be threatened on  account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion; and (ii) the country  will make an assessment, or permit an assessment to be made, of whether or not a person taken to the country under that section  is covered by the definition of refugee in Article 1A of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol and: (b)  may have regard to any other matter, which in the opinion of the Minister, relates to the national interest.

 STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR THINKING THAT IT IS IN THE 

 NATIONAL INTEREST TO DESIGNATE NAURU TO BE A REGIONAL 

 PROCESSING COUNTRY 

 

 THE DESIGNATION 

 1. I,  CHRIS  BOWEN  MP,  Minister  for  Immigration  and  Citizenship,  have  

 exercised my power under s 198AB(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) to 

 designate  that  the  Republic  of  Nauru  (Nauru)  is  a  regional  processing  

 country. 

 2. This  document  sets  out  my  reasons  for  thinking  that  it  is  in  the  national  

 interest to designate Nauru to be a regional processing country.  

 THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK 

 3. The  power conferred  on  me  by  s  198AB(1)  to  designate  that  a  country  is  a  

 regional processing country is contained in Part 2 Division 8 Subdivision B of 

 the  Act.  That  Subdivision  was  introduced  into  the  Act  by  the  Migration 

 Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Act 2012 

 (the  Amendment  Act).  Section  198AA  states  that  the  Subdivision  was  

 enacted because Parliament considers that: 

  (a) people  smuggling,  and  its  undesirable  consequences   including the resulting loss of life at sea, are major regional  problems that need to be addressed; and 

 (b) offshore  entry persons, including offshore  entry persons  in   respect  of  who  Australia  has  or  may  have  protection   obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by  the  Refugees  Protocol,  should  be  able  to be  taken  to  any    country designated to be a regional processing country; 

 

 

 3 

 (c) it  is  a  matter  for  the  Minister  and  Parliament  to  decide   which countries should be designated as regional processing  countries; and  

 (d) the  designation  of  a  country  to  be  a  regional  processing   country  need  not  be  determined  by  reference  to  the   international obligations or domestic law of that country. 

 4. Subsection 198AB(2) provides that the only condition for the exercise of the 

 power  conferred  on  me  by  s  198AB(1)  is  that  I  think  it  is  in  the  national  

 interest to designate the country to be a regional processing country. 

 5. Subsection 198AB(3) provides that, in considering the national interest for the 

 purposes of s 198AB(2), I must have regard to whether or not the country has 

 given Australia any assurances to the effect that: 

 (i)  the  country  will  not  expel  or  return  a  person  taken  to  the   country under section 198AD to another country where his  or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of his  or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular  social group or political opinion; and 

 (ii)  the country will make an assessment, or permit an assessment to be  made,  of  whether  or  not  a  person  taken  to  the  country  under  that   section is covered by the definition of refugee in Article 1A of the  Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol; 

 and I may have regard to any other matter which in my opinion relates to the 

 national interest. 

 6. Subsection  198AB(4)  provides  that  the  assurances  referred  to  in  s 198AB(3) 

 need not be legally binding. 

 7. Section 198AD of the Act has the effect that, subject to ss 198AE, 198AF and 

 198AG,  an  officer  must,  as  soon  as  reasonably  practicable,  take  an  offshore  

 entry  person  who  is  detained  under  s  189  from  Australia  to  a  regional  

 processing country. Section 198AE confers on me a personal non-compellable 

 power  to  determine  in  writing  that  s  198AD  does  not  apply  to  an  offshore  

 entry person, if I think that it is in the public interest to do so. Section 198AF 

 provides that s 198AD does not apply to an offshore entry person if there is no 

 regional  processing  country.  And  s  198AG  provides  that  s  198AD  does  not  

 apply to an offshore entry person if the regional  processing country, or each 

 

 

 4 

 regional  processing  country  (if  there  is  more  than  one  such  country), has 

 advised an officer that the country will not accept the offshore entry person.  

 BACKGROUND 

 8. On 28 June 2012, the Prime Minister appointed an independent  expert  panel  

 (the panel)  to  provide  advice  and  recommendations  to  the  Government  on  

 policy options  available  to  prevent  asylum  seekers  risking  their  lives  on  

 dangerous  boat  journeys  to  Australia.   The  panel  consisted  of  Air  Chief  

 Marshal Angus Houston AC AFC (Retired), Mr Paris Aristotle AM, Director 

 of  the  Victorian  Foundation  for  Survivors  of Torture  Inc  and  Professor  

 Michael L’Estrange AO, Director, National Security College.  

 9. The  panel  consulted  widely  on  asylum  issues  with  political  leaders,  other  

 members  of  the  Parliament,  agencies  and  departments  of  Government,  non-government organisations, academics and other experts as well as those in the 

 wider  community.   The  panel  also  held  discussions  with  representatives  of  

 some  refugee  communities  in  Australia  and  refugees  who  travelled  to  

 Australia through irregular means.  The panel received more than 550 written 

 submissions. 

 10. The  panel  released  its  report  on  13  August  2012.   The  panel  recommended, 

 among  other  things,  that  “a  capacity  be  established  in  Nauru  as  soon  as  

 practical  to  process  the  claims  of  IMAs  [irregular  maritime  arrivals]  

 transferred  from  Australia  in  ways  consistent  with  Australian  and  Nauruan  

 responsibilities under international law”.  

 11. Following  the  report  of  the  panel,  the  Government  introduced  the  Migration 

 Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Bill 2012.  

 That  Bill  passed  both  Houses  of  Parliament  with  the  support  of  both  the  

 Government and the Opposition. 

 SUBMISSION  

 12. To  facilitate  my  consideration  of  whether  I  think  that  it  is  in  the  national  

 interest to designate Nauru to be a regional processing country,  a submission 

 

 

 5 

 was  provided  to  me  by  my  Department,  which  included  the  following  

 attachments: 

 (1) Memorandum  of  Understanding  between  the  Republic  of  Nauru  and  

 the  Commonwealth  of  Australia,  relating  to  the  transfer  to  and  

 assessment of persons in Nauru, and related issues, which was signed 

 on 30 August 2012 (the MOU) (Attachment A) 

 (2) a statement about arrangements that are in place, and are to be put in 

 place, in Nauru for the treatment of persons taken there under s 198AD 

 of the Act (the statement of arrangements) (Attachment B) 

 (3) advice  received  from  the  Office  of  the  United  Nations  High  

 Commissioner  for  Refugees  (the  UNHCR)  in  relation  to the 

 designation (the UNHCR advice) (Attachment C). 

 MY REASONS 

 13. I  think  that  it  is  in  the  national  interest  to  designate  Nauru  to  be  a  regional  

 processing country, because: 

 (1) Nauru  has  given  Australia  the  assurances  referred  to  in  

 s 198AB(3)(a)(i) and (ii) of the Act and other assurances; 

 (2) I consider designating Nauru to be a regional processing country will 

 discourage  irregular  and  dangerous  maritime  voyages  and  thereby  

 reduce the risk of the loss of life at sea; 

 (3) I consider designating Nauru to be a regional processing country will 

 promote  the  maintenance  of  a  fair  and  orderly  Refugee  and  

 Humanitarian  Program  that  retains  the  confidence  of  the  Australian  

 people; 

 (4) I consider designating Nauru to be a regional processing country will 

 promote  regional  co-operation in  relation  to  irregular  migration and 

 address people smuggling and its undesirable consequences; 

 

 

 6 

 (5) I consider the arrangements that are already in place in Nauru and that 

 are proposed to be put in place in Nauru to be satisfactory.  

 14. It is my opinion that, in addition to the assurances to which I must have regard 

 pursuant to s 198AB(3), each of the other matters referred to in the preceding 

 paragraph relates to the national interest.  

 Assurances by Nauru 

 15. As stated above, s 198AB(3) provides that, in considering the national interest 

 for  the  purposes  of  s  198AB(2),  I  must  have  regard  to  whether  or  not  the  

 country has given Australia any assurances to the effect set out in paragraph 5 

 above. 

 16. Nauru  has  given  those  assurances.  They  are  contained  in  clause  14  of  the  

 MOU. I consider that the “Transferees” who are referred to in clause 14 of the 

 MOU are people who will be taken to Nauru pursuant to s 198AD of the Act. 

 17. Nauru has given an additional assurance in clause 14 of the MOU that it will 

 not  send  a  transferee  to  another  country  where  there  is  a  real  risk  that  the  

 transferee will be subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 

 or  punishment,  arbitrary  deprivation  of  life  of  the  imposition  of  the  death  

 penalty. 

 18. Nauru  has  also  assured  Australia  that  it  will  permit  Australian  officials  to  

 prepare  assessments  against  Article  1A  of  the  Refugees  Convention,  as  

 amended by the Refugees Protocol. 

 19. Whether or not the assurances referred to above are legally binding, I expect 

 that  Nauru  will  act  in  accordance  with  them  and  that,  as  a  consequence,  

 offshore  entry  persons  who  are  transferred  to  Nauru  will  not  be  at  risk  of  

 being  sent  to  another  country  where  they  have  a  well  founded  fear  of  

 persecution,  and  will  have  any  claims  that  they  may  make  to  be  refugees  

 within Article 1A of the Refugee Convention assessed.  That was part of my 

 thinking  as  to  why  it  is in  the  national  interest  to  designate  Nauru  to  be  a  

 regional processing country. 

 

 

 7 

 Discouragement of irregular and dangerous maritime voyages 

 20. I  think  that  it  is  in  the  national  interest  to  take  action  that  is  directed  to  

 discouraging  irregular  and  dangerous maritime  voyages  to  Australia  and  

 thereby to reducing the risk of loss of life at sea.  In my view, s 198AA(a) of 

 the Act supports that conclusion. 

 21. I think that designating Nauru to be a regional processing country may act as a 

 circuit  breaker  in  relation to  the  recent  surge  in  the  number  of  irregular  and  

 dangerous maritime voyages to Australia. The surge in arrivals is indicated by 

 the following figures my Department has provided to me: 

 (1) From  2002  to  2008  there  were  fewer  than  10  boats  a  year.  The  total  

 number of passengers was fewer than 200 each year. 

 (2) In 2009, there were 60 boats carrying 2,726 passengers. 

 (3) In 2010, there were 134 boats carrying 6,555 passengers. 

 (4) In 2011, there were 69 boats carrying 4,565 passengers. 

 (5) In the year to 8 September 2012, there have been 135 boats  carrying 

 8,851 passengers. The number of passengers who arrived in Australia 

 in  the  first  seven  months  of  2012  (7,120)  exceeded  the  number  who  

 arrived in total in each of 2011 and 2010.  The number of passengers 

 who  arrived  in  August 2012  (1,933)  constituted  the  largest  ever  

 monthly number and was the largest ever number for the fourth month 

 in a row. 

 (6) Passenger numbers per boat arrival have also been increasing. 

 22. A substantial number of lives have been lost at sea as a result of the activities 

 of  people  smugglers.   Since  2001,  it  is  estimated  that  1064  passengers  have  

 died (or gone missing, presumed dead).  Of these, 704  deaths  have  occurred  

 since October 2009.  The figures above include the most recent tragedy on 30 

 August 2012, during which an estimated 100 people lost their lives following 

 the sinking of a vessel some 42 nautical miles off the Indonesian coast.  

 

 

 8 

 23. I  think  that  the  cost  of  irregular  maritime  voyages,  in  terms of  the  loss  of  

 human life and in respect  of the substantial  financial  and  resourcing costs  to 

 the Commonwealth in dealing with such arrivals (estimated to be in excess of 

 $5 billion over the forward estimates period), means that it is in the national 

 interest  to  attempt  to  reduce  the  number  of  such  voyages,  and  to  do  so 

 urgently. 

 24. I think that, as people who are considering travelling to Australia on irregular 

 maritime voyages become aware that their protection claims may be assessed 

 in Nauru rather than in Australia, they may be discouraged from risking their 

 lives by so doing, because it will change the equation between risk and reward 

 for prospective IMAs. 

 I also think that  designating Nauru to be a regional  processing country will  make it  

 more  difficult  for  people  smugglers  to  sell  the  opportunity  to  resettle  in  

 Australia 

 Maintenance of a fair and orderly Refugee and Humanitarian Program 

 25. I  think  that  it  is  in  the  national  interest  to  take  action  that  will  promote  the  

 maintenance  of  a  fair  and  orderly  Refugee  and  Humanitarian  Program  that  

 retains the confidence of the Australian people. 

 26. Many of the people who  arrive in Australia as IMAs are refugees within  the 

 meaning of Article 1A of the Refugees  Convention.  But many persons who  

 need protection  under  that  Convention  are  also  located  outside  Australia.   

 While the Australian Government has recently increased the number of visas 

 available under its Refugee and Humanitarian Program each year, that number 

 remains limited.  The policy of successive governments has been that grants of 

 visas to both offshore and onshore refugees, including those who have arrived 

 as  IMAs  as  a  result  of  the  activities  of  people  smugglers,  are required  to  be  

 within this limit.  As a result, for each visa granted to an onshore claimant in a 

 given  year,  there  is  one  less  visa  available  to  be  granted  to  an  offshore  

 claimant  in  that  year.   In  2011-2012,  for  the  first  time  more  visas  were  

 granted to onshore claimants  than to offshore claimants, shifting the balance 

 of the program from its traditional offshore focus. 

 

 

 9 

 27. The designation of Nauru as a regional processing country will have the effect 

 that officers  will  be  obliged  to  take  offshore  entry persons  who  are  detained  

 under  s  189  of  the  Act  from  Australia  to  Nauru  as  soon  as  reasonably  

 practicable (unless I also designate another country or countries to be regional 

 processing countries or I exercise my personal non-compellable power under s 

 198AE). For  that  reason,  I  consider  that  the  designation  of  Nauru  to  be  a  

 regional  processing  country  is  likely  to  have  the  effect  that  a  greater  

 proportion  of  visas  will  be  given  to  offshore  claimants  than  is  presently  the  

 case.  I think that this would result in a fairer and more orderly Refugee and 

 Humanitarian Program, and one which is more likely to retain the confidence 

 of  the  Australian  people.  This  is  because  I think  that  the  allocation  of  

 protection  visas  to  refugees  under  Australia’s  Refugee  and  Humanitarian  

 Program should  not  be  determined by  whether  or  not  the  refugee  has  

 undertaken an irregular and dangerous maritime voyage to Australia.  

 Promotion of regional co-operation 

 28. I  think  that  it  is  in  the  national  interest  to  take  action  that  will  promote  

 regional  co-operation  in  relation  to  addressing  people  smuggling  and  its  

 undesirable consequences. 

 29. Irregular migration is a continuing challenge for  the Asia-Pacific region.   At 

 the Fourth Ministerial  Conference of the Bali  Process  on People Smuggling,  

 Trafficking  and  Related  Transnational  Crime  held  in  Indonesia  on  29-30 

 March 2011, Ministers agreed to a regional cooperation framework that would 

 provide  a  more  effective  way  for  interested  states  to  cooperate  to  reduce  

 irregular  migration  in  the  region.   That  framework  was  to  be  given  effect  

 through arrangements entered into on a bilateral or sub-regional basis. 

 30. I think  that  the  designation  of  Nauru  as  a  regional  processing  country  will  

 encourage  the  development  of  further  regionally  integrated  arrangements  to  

 address the humanitarian and other problems caused by people smuggling, by 

 providing  a  practical  demonstration  of  regional  co-operation  to  address  

 irregular migration. 

 

 

 10 

 Arrangements 

 31. I  think  that  the  arrangements  that  are  in  place  and  are  to  be  put  in  place,  in  

 Nauru for the treatment  of persons  taken to Nauru - being the  arrangements  

 described in the statement of arrangements - are satisfactory.  

 32. I am aware that: 

 (1) some aspects of the arrangements that it is proposed would operate in 

 Nauru if I designate Nauru to be a regional processing country are still 

 the subject of negotiation between the Commonwealth and Nauru;  

 (2) work  is  still  continuing  to  establish  the  accommodation  and  other  

 facilities that will be available to Transferees taken to Nauru. 

 These facts do not alter my view as to the national interest. 

 International obligations 

 33. If  Nauru  is  designated as  a  regional  processing  country  it  will  follow,  as  is 

 noted  in  s  198AA(b), that offshore  entry  persons,  including  offshore entry 

 persons in respect of whom Australia has or may have protection obligations 

 under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol, may be 

 taken to Nauru. 

 34. The  content  of  Australia’s  international  obligations  is  contestable. In 

 particular, there  is  a  range  of  views  held  by  lawyers,  academics, non-government  organisations  and  others  as  to  the  content  of  Australia’s  

 international  obligations  with  respect  to  persons  transferred  to  another 

 country, some of which differ from the Department’s position. 

 35. On the basis of the material set out in the submission from the Department, I 

 think  that  it  is  not  inconsistent  with  Australia’s  international  obligations  

 (including  but  not  limited  to  Australia’s  obligations  under  the  Refugees 

 Convention)  to  designate  Nauru  as  a  regional  processing  country,  

 notwithstanding  that  this  will  create  a  duty  under  s  198AD  to  take  offshore  

 

 

 11 

 entry  persons  to  Nauru  (subject  to  the  exercise  of  my personal  non-compellable power in s 198AE). 

 36. However, even if the designation of Nauru to be a regional processing country 

 is  inconsistent  with  Australia’s  international  obligations,  I nevertheless think 

 that it is in the national interest to designate Nauru to be a regional processing 

 country.  

 37. In considering whether I think it is in the national interest to designate Nauru 

 to be a regional processing country, in addition to the matters outlined above I 

 have: 

 (1) had regard to the UNHCR advice; 

 (2) chosen not to have regard to the international obligations or domestic 

 law of Nauru. 

 Concluded opinion 

 38. In light of the matters identified above, I think that it is in the national interest 

 to designate Nauru to be a regional processing country.
