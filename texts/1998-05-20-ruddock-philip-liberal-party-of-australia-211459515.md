  The Hon. Philip Ruddock MP 

  

  50th anniversary of the Adult Migrant English Program

  

  MPS 52/98

  

  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today launched cele brations to mark the 50TH anniversary of one 
of Australia's key migrant settlement schemes. 

  

 At the launch in Melbourne 
of the Adult Migrant English Program's (AMEP) anniversary, Mr Ruddock 
described the program as a world-leading language education service. 

  

 "The AMEP helps 
vast numbers of adult migrants and refugees learn the English language 
and therefore settle more successfully in Australia," Mr Ruddock 
said. 

  

 "AMEP's importance 
is highlighted by studies which show that migrants with a low level 
of English language skill tend to have a poor employment experience 
and can face social isolation". 

  

 "Recent reforms 
of the AMEP aim to improve the flexibility and effectiveness of English 
language tuition, giving migrants access to services that are responsive 
to their changing needs". 

  

 Mr Ruddock said the 
AMEP provides 9 million hours of English language tuition a year, and 
in 1997 assisted over 39,000 clients from 89 language backgrounds. 

  

 "AMEP contributes 
not only the successful settlement of non-English-speaking migrants 
and refugees, but also to the building of this nation. 

  

 "Australia's rich 
cultural diversity and our tolerance and respect for our fellow Australians 
has earned this country an enviable international reputation as a harmonious 
and progressive society. 

  

 "The Adult Migrant 
English Program has been a major contributor to this success story". 

  

 The AMEP's 50TH anniversary 
celebrations will continue throughout the year and into early 1999, 
culminating in a major international conference on English language 
policy and provision to be held on 10-12 February in Melbourne. 

  

  The Minister will launch the Adult Migrant English Program's 50th 
anniversary celebrations today at 11.00am in the ANZ Pavilion, Victorian 
Arts Centre, 100 St Kilda Road.

  

  Wednesday, 20 May, 1998
