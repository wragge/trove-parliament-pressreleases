 YOUNG  HOMELESS  ALLOWANCE

 YOUNG HOMELESS ALLOWANCE 

 m SIU D EN TS W H O  IS ELIGIBLE? PAYMENTS

 1. Wards of the Commonwealth 2. Refugees whose parents are not living in  Australia 3. Homeless students.

 To qualify for this allowance students must be able to prove that they have not.been living in the family home for at least six weeks because:

 â¢  there is no family home at which their parents  are prepared to let them live; â¢ it would be unreasonable to expect the student  to return home because of domestic violence, 

 incestuous harassment or other such exception­ al circumstances. In addition: â¢ the parents do not, and will not contribute, 

 either directly or indirectly, to the student's  support; â¢  the student is not being supported by other  adults acting as guardians on a long-term 

 basis; and â¢  the student is not receiving, on a long-term  basis, any payment from a government 

 department other than an education allowance  from the Commonwealth Department of  Education.

 EVIDENCE REQUIRED

 A homeless student will be required to provide as  much of the following evidence as possible to  support a claim for an allowance:

 â¢  a statutory declaration outlining family  circumstances; â¢ statutory declarations and/or reports from at  least two persons such as a school principal, 

 counsellor, a social worker, a minister of  religion, a member of the police force or a  doctor who are familiar with the circumstances  and family background. Declarations should  relate to the eligibility conditions set out above.

 REVIEW O F THE ALLOW ANCE

 Students who are granted the allowance as  refugees or homeless students will be sent a form  every twelve weeks to make sure they are still  eligible to receive payments.

 The first payment will be sent as soon as possible  after the entitlement has been assessed. Subse­ quent payments will follow at four weekly inter­ vals. Payments will be made to a:

 â¢  bank account; :

 â¢  credit union account; or â¢ building society account.

 Students who do not have one of these accounts  should open one.

 TERTIARY STUDENTS

 Tertiary students who apply for the Young  Homeless Allowance must also meet the eligibility  requirements for the Tertiary Education Allowance 

 Scheme. '

 SECONDARY STUDENTS

 In general students should have been aged under  19 years at 1 January 1986.

 The age limit may be extended by one year in  any case where the student's progress has been  delayed by special circumstances such as illness,  English language difficulties, transfer from a 

 different education system, periods of employ­ ment or training or redirection of studies. Other  special circumstances will be looked at sym­ pathetically.

 Secondary students, aged 19 as at 1 January  1986, must in general meet the eligibility require­ ments for the Adult Secondary Education

 ÎÎ¶-

 YOUNG HOMELESS ALLOWANCE 

 FOR UNEMPLOYEDÎÎ».Î¯ i  . ELIGIBILITY

 The allowance is designed to assist unemployed,  homeless 16 and 17 year-olds. However, if  someone is under 16 and on special benefit,  Social Security will pay them the Young Homeless  Allowance if they meet the homeless criteria.

 In order to qualify for the allowance the claimant  must be able to show: he or she has not been  living in the family home for at least the previous  six weeks because:

 â¢ there is no family home or â¢ parents will not let the young person live with  them or â¢ it would be unreasonable to require the young 

 person to return home because of domestic  violence, incestuous harassment or other  exceptional circumstances and â¢ the parents do not and will not contribute to 

 the support of the young person and â¢ the young person is not being supported by an  adult or adults acting as a guardian on a long­

 term basis and â¢ the young person would not be receiving any  form of Commonwealth and/or State income 

 support on a continuing basis.

 These points may need to be verified by police,  from medical records, from reports from counsel­ lors, or from records from hostels and refuges. It  will not always be necessary to interview parents.

 EFFECT O F IN CO M E O N   THE BENEFIT A N D   ALLOWANCE

 The unemployment benefit income test will apply  to the benefit and allowance as a combined  amount.

 A beneficiary may earn a total of $30.00 a week  before income affects their benefit. After $30.00,  benefit will be reduced by 50 The allowance is taxable. However, a person  who receives benefit plus YHA for a full financial  year would not have a tax liability unless he or  she has some other income in that year. EXTRA IN FO RM A TIO N The allowance will be reviewed every 12 weeks  to see if the young person's circumstances have  changed in any way. Rent assistance will not be paid. Normal proof of identity procedures will apply,  i.e. the person will be required to show birth  certificate, passport or other identification along  with something like driver's licence, bank book,  reference from school, etc. W HAT IS THE  Y O U N G  HOMELESS  ALLOW ANCE? This allowance is paid in addition to unemploy­ ment, special and sickness benefits. It is designed  to bring the benefit amount up to the maximum  rate of TEAS. At this stage that amount is $73.28 per week. YHA rates will increase each year from 1 January  1988, in line with rises in TEAS. da 9 ADDRESSES O F  C O M M O N W EA LTH  DEPARTMENT O F EDUCATION N ew  South Wales 59 Goulburn Street  Sydney 2000  Telephone (02)218 8555 Victoria 17 Yarra Street  Hawthorn 3122  Telephone (03) 810 0555 Queensland 167 Eagle Street  Brisbane 4000  Telephone (07) 229 9133 32 Alpin Street  Cairns 4870 Telephone (070) 51 3288  Customs House  Quay Street  Rockhampton 4700  Telephone (079) 27 2455 1st Floor Townsville Commonwealth Centre  Cnr Stanley and Walker Streets  Townsville 4810  Telephone (077) 72 9444 Western Australia 6th Floor National Westminster House  251 Adelaide Terrace  Perth 6000 Telephone (09) 425 4545  South Australia  230 North Terrace  Adelaide 5000  Telephone (08) 228 2911 Tasmania 1st Floor  T&G Building  115 Collins Street  Hobart 7000  Telephone (002) 20 5011 Northern Territory 2nd Floor  Casuarina Plaza Cnr Trower Road and Vonderlin Drive Casuarina 5792 Telephone (089) 27 6133 Cnr Bath Street and Gregory Terrace Alice Springs 5750 â  Telephone (089) 50 4346 Australian Capital Territory 5th Floor  MIC Tower  Kellie Street  Phillip 2606 Telephone (062) 83 7777 d$tYoung people who are homeless and unemployed should contact the Commonwealth Department of Social Security.
