 THE UNITED NATIONS: A NEW ERA

 The following is the text of an address by the Minister for Foreign  Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, to the United Nations  General Assembly, New York, 2 October 1990.

 THE UNITED NATIONS:  A NEW ERA

 Address by Senator Gareth Evans, Australian Minister for Foreign  Affairs and Trade, to the United Nations General Assembly, 2  October 1990

 It is with great pleasure that I congratulate you, Dr de Marcor  

 on your election to the Presidency of this General Assembly, a 

 role for which your extensive experience in international 

 relations, your legal training, and your interest in human rights 

 qualify you highly. The excellent relationship between Australia 

 and Malta is long-standing, based on extensive family and 

 community ties as well as our strong and active membership of the 

 Commonwealth, and we look forward to working closely with y o u . I 

 would also join others in extending a warm welcome to Namibia and 

 Liechtenstein, the newest members of the United Nations.

 We meet today in the General Assembly on the eve of the re­

 creation of a united Germany, an event which marks - as no other 

 could do so clearly - the end of the post-War era. It is an era 

 that has been dominated by the Cold War and nuclear 

 confrontation, but has also seen extraordinary change:  the end 

 of the European colonial empires and the re-emergence of the 

 independent nations of Africa and Asia? the economic 

 reconstruction and ever closer political association of Western 

 Europe; and - starting with the creation of the Bank and the 

 Fund and the specialised agencies of the UN - the growth of 

 multilateralism on a remarkable and unprecedented scale.

 But the post-War era has left for us many problems that still 

 remain to be solved. Iraq's aggression in the Gulf has shown 

 that the habits of millennia are not going to change overnight, 

 and that the arrogance of military power remains a scourge with 

 which the world will still have to deal. The scourges of hunger, 

 ill-health, poverty and debt remain to an intolerable extent,

 2

 threatening to widen rather than narrow the already alarming gulf 

 between North and South. The scourge of racism, and ethnic and 

 religious hatred, still remains to be purged from many countries 

 and regions. And there is another scourge - the impact of human 

 activity upon the sustaining environment of our planet itself - 

 the magnitude of which we are only beginning now to recognise.

 The challenge for us all in the new era ahead of us - as 

 relationships, policies and attitudes that had been frozen for so 

 long continue to unfreeze, as the Cold War becomes the Great Thaw 

 - is to confront and overcome these scourges once and for a l l .  

 If that is to happen we will need, above all else, to develop 

 habits of mind which are cooperative rather confrontational, and 

 habits of action which are instinctively multilateral. Whether 

 the challenge goes to the physical security of nations, the 

 economic health of their peoples, the environmental integrity of 

 the planet itself, or any other problem that no nation can solve 

 wholly by itself, then we have to derive inspiration from the 

 thought that we are one world, and can each survive only if we 

 all can act collectively.

 There is nothing inevitable about the development of any such 

 approach, although events of recent weeks and months can 

 certainly give us heart. The trends that will shape this era are 

 our own to make. Indeed it is the actions over the next few 

 years of the very men and women who have been assembled in this 

 building over the past week, which will launch this era for good 

 or for ill. The world has been given a second chance, and this 

 time we must not again take a false turn.

 * *  *

 How we shape the security system of the new era is being 

 comprehensively tested at its outset by the present Gulf crisis.  

 If unity holds in this instance - if this community of nations, 

 acting together under the authority of the UN Charter, end with

 3

 the fu 1 support of the Security Council, succeeds in 

 demonstr vtin5 beyond doubt that aggression does not pay and 

 cannot succeed - the demonstration effect will weigh heavily on 

 those nations, particularly those with great comparative regional 

 power,  which might in the future be tempted to settle 

 disagreements by intimidation and force. If our resolve weakens, 

 the demonstration effect will be equally convincing in its 

 message that the international community is powerless to enforce 

 decisions that we all recognise to be just. Such an outcome is 

 unthinkable.

 The cri is in the Gulf can only be resolved on the basis of the 

 conditicns set by the UN Security Council Resolutions being fully 

 and unev uivocally met - i.e. by Iraq completely withdrawing from 

 Kuwait, the restoration of the legitimate Kuwaiti Government and 

 the tel· ase of all foreign nationals who want to leave. It is 

 Austral:.a's hope that these objectives can be met through the 

 rigourox s application of sanctions pursuant to Security Council 

 Resolutions 561, 665 and 670. Military strike action cannot and 

 should rot be wholly ruled out at the end of the day, should all 

 other means of resolving the crisis fail, but Australia shares 

 the universal hope that sanity will prevail, and that a peace 

 without appeasement will be achieved without the horrors of war 

 having to be contemplated.

 We can both encouragement and hope for the future from the 

 unprecedented level of international cooperation to meet the 

 crisis - cooperation which has enabled the UN Security Council to 

 respond promptly and effectively, and restored the Council to its 

 proper central place in international security. The greater 

 willingness of the Permanent Five members of the Security Council 

 to work tejether has not only held the line in the Gulf crisis, 

 but has beer, a crucial factor in the now hopefully imminent 

 resolution of the Cambodian problem - one that has not only 

 involved many years of tragedy for the Cambodian people, but a 

 severe on-going challenge to the security of the South East Asia

 4

 region.

 A detailed framework for a comprehensive Cambodian settlement has 

 been drafted and agreed by the Permanent Five over the course of 

 this year, and accepted in its entirety by a meeting of the 

 Cambotiian parties convened by the Paris Conference Co-Chairmen in 

 Jakarta last month. That framework document - based in 

 significant part, we are gratified to note, on ideas developed by 

 Australia for an enhanced UN role - involves two central 

 components: first, the creation of a fully representative 

 Supreme National Council to embody the sovereignty of the 

 Cambodian nation; and, secondly, a role for the UN which extends 

 not only ·*-Î¿ traditional peace-keeping activity and increasingly 

 an common electoral organisation, but responsibility as well for 

 key elements of civil administration in the transitional period 

 pending free and fair elections. The SNC has been formally 

 established it will occupy the Cambodian seat in the United 

 Nations, and the process of putting in place a final 

 comprehensive. settlement, endorsed by a reconvened Paris 

 Conference, is well under way. A number of matters, both 

 procedural and substantive, remain to be negotiated, and there is 

 bound to be seme faltering before the process is complete, but 

 the commitment of relevant countries and parties to finally 

 achieving peace is now such that it is possible, after years of 

 frustration and disappointment, to be much more optimistic than 

 ever before that a durable place will shortly be achieved.

 For some c ,her long-running regional conflicts the outlook is 

 much less bright. Pre-eminent among them is the Palestinian 

 issue, which - whatever the outcome of the Gulf crisis - will 

 simply noJ .  go away until it is resolved in a manner which meets 

 the basio needs and aspirations of both Palestinians and 

 Israelis. Australia has consistently expressed support for a 

 peaceful resolution of the Arab/Israeli dispute on the 

 Palestinian issue on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 

 242 and 338. We assert Israel's right to live within secure and

 5

 recognised borders, but also acknowledge that of the Palestinian 

 people to self-determination, including their right to an 

 independent state if they so choose. We regard the proposals for 

 the establishment of an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue as a step 

 â -.cwards the achievement of a peaceful settlement, and encourage 

 all the involved parties to pursue that dialogue with real and 

 sustained commitment.

 One aspect of this issue which continues to hinder the peace 

 â¢j ccess is General Assembly Resolution 3379 of 1975, equating 

 Oionism with racism. Australia remains strongly opposed to this 

 Resolution, which only exacerbates the differences between the 

 parties. We hope that, with the revitalisation of its role and 

 responsibilities in promoting international cooperation, the 

 United Nations will rescind the Resolution.

 Another Middle East issue of continuing concern is the situation 

 in Lebanon,  e country torn apart by conflict now for fifteen 

 years. The maif Agreement, concluded in October last year by the 

 Lebanese themselves with the support of the Aral? League, 

 represented a welcome breakthrough. The international community 

 should stand ready to assist Lebanon in achieving peace, but the 

 e ssential requirement is that there be a commitment from all the 

 parties in Lebanon to national reconciliation and a willingness 

 to compromise to arrive at a negotiated solution. If anything 

 has become clear over the last fifteen years, it is that a 

 lasting solution cannot be imposed by force.

 The continuing troubles in Cyprus are another instance of 

 entrenched attitudes making reconciliation extremely difficult. 

 The failure of the attempt to revive the intercommunal talks in 

 February was particularly disappointing. Prospects for progress 

 will remain bleak unless there is a real determination to succeed 

 on both sides, and a willingness to enter into negotiations free 

 cf preconditions. Australia continues to support the efforts of 

 the Secretary General to promote a negotiated solution in the

 6

 belief that tnis is the route by which a just settlement is most 

 likely to be reached.

 That just, settlements of apparently intractable problems can be 

 reached with the help of the international community is amply 

 demonstrated by recent events in Southern Africa. In Namibia,  

 the United Nations mounted one of most complex peace-keeping 

 operation in its history and played a vital role in guaranteeing 

 i.he impartiality of the elections and of the transition process. 

 ;.nc in South Africa itself, the Government has, over the past few 

 .onths, e.t last begun to take steps towards negotiations with 

 representatives of the majority of South Africans and towards 

 dismantling the repressive and brutal system of apartheid. The 

 Australian Government warmly welcomes the statesmanship showr. no 

 date by President de Klerk, but urges the South African 

 Government to move as soon as possible into substantive 

 constitutional negotiations and to remove the remaining 

 legislative cornerstones of the apartheid system. More does need 

 to be done before those who have suffered under apartheid, and 

 those who support their struggle, can be confident that 

 developments in South Africa do constitute "profound and 

 irreversible change". We believe that sanctions imposed by the 

 international community have played a central role in bringing 

 about the important changes now under way, and that this 

 sanctions pressure should not yet be reduced or lifted. But we 

 hope the time will rapidly come when it can be.

 For Australia, the South Pacific is also an area of vital 

 interest and we continue to encourage processes of polltical 

 development in this region. We are gratified in this respect by 

 the continuing success of the Matignon and Oudinot Accords in 

 creating a constructive and peaceful environment in New Caledonia 

 for the working out of that country's political future- Equally, 

 however, we continue to be deeply disappointed at the backward 

 steps that occurred in JEXii with the events of 1987 and the 

 recent promulgation of a Constitution which, while marking a

 7

 '.welcome return to representative constitutional government, 

 nonetheless in the process builds new and far-reaching racially 

 discriminatory principles into the Fijian political system.

 Two countries in the Pacific who have been frustrated in fully 

 developing a political identity of their own are the Federated 

 States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands,  and Australia 

 believes the United Nations has a constructive role to play in 

 this respect. The full fruits of self-government which should 

 ha^e followed their legitimate acts of self-determination have 

 been denied to them by legalistic approaches to the question of 

 their political status. The continued application of the 

 trusteeship regime to them not only belittles what they have 

 already achieved in establishing independent political 

 identities, but imposes practical disadvantages on them in their 

 pursuit of national development.

 * * *

 If the coming era is to learn from the mistakes of the past, we 

 need not only to find new cooperative ways of resolving regional 

 problems - whether these be potentially global or much more 

 limited in their consequences - but to tackle with determination 

 and stamina the most alarming global security problems of the 

 Told War era - the upward spiral of arms procurement and the 

 proliferation of increasingly more destructive weapons. That 

 task is all the more important in our increasingly multipolar 

 wc-r'd. While the progress made by the United States and the 

 Soviet Union in their bilateral negotiations is evidence of 

 superpower commitment to a more peaceful world, it should also 

 now be complemented by progress in multilateral disarmament 

 negot" ations.

 We in Australia are proud of our commitment to the process of 

 disarmament, and intend to redouble our efforts to capitalise on

 8

 the current circumstances to achieve specific disarmament goal, 

 in the multilateral context, particularly in relation to chemical 

 and nuclear weapons. Significant progress on the achievement of 

 ;  Chemical Weapons Convention has been made in the last year, buo 

 h e  need to conclude this Convention is now greater than ever, 

 and the opportunity to do so muse be seized. Australia believes 

 'hat a decisive step towards this goal would be a ministerial- 

 l'-vel meeting of the Conference on Disarmament to be held as soon 

 as possible.

 We will also continue to work assiduously to eliminate nuclear 

 weapons. Australia is proud of our part, together with the other 

 members of the South Pacific Forum, in the creation of the Treaty 

 of Rarotonga, which has established a nuclear free zone in the 

 3outh Pacific. We will not rest until a Comprehensive Test Ban 

 Treaty has keen achieved with appropriate verification 

 procedures. To help move towards that goal, we will be once more 

 proposing with New Zealand and other co-sponsors a resolution on 

 c .  CTB this year and look forward to again receiving strong 

 support for it. We would wish this support to be carried over to 

 the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, which is the appropriate 

 forum for a CTB to be negotiated. We are therefore pleased that 

 the CD has this year re-established an Ad Hoc Committee on a 

 Nuclear Test Ban as which will provide the opportunity for 

 important preparatory work to a CTB to be undertaken,

 Australia was ar. active participant in the recent Nuclear Non­

 Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in Geneva. Despite its 

 regrettable inability to adopt a final declaration, we 

 nonetheless consider the Conference to have been a considerable 

 success, reaching agreement as it did on a number of important 

 issues, in particular the question of fullscope safeguards as a 

 condition for nuclear supply. We will be working to build on the 

 achievements of the Conference and to set the scene for a 

 successful review and extension of the Treaty in 1995. The 

 Treaty is an absolutely essential foundation on which the new

 9

 relationships of the coming era must be built.

 The acquisition of conventional weapons continues at an alarming 

 rate in many parts of the globe. Often scarce resources are 

 diverted from social and economic development to military 

 expenditure. Australia supports measures by all States to reduce 

 military budgets and to the implementation of confidence building 

 measures which will reduce the risk of conflict.

 * * *

 At the same time as working together for a future of common 

 security, the world community has a second chance to show its 

 equal determination to create a future of common prosperity. 

 Meeting economic challenges is no less important than meeting 

 security challenges if we are to provide guaranteed life and 

 health for our children, and a fulfilling life for all our 

 citizens.

 Australia supports the efforts made by the United Nations in 

 mobilising international support for development efforts. The 

 Eighteenth Special Session of the General Assembly in Apri 1 

 highlighted a new sense of commitment and renewed optimism for 

 global economic cooperation. The globalisation of economic 

 p roblems has beer, accompanied by a growing awareness that their 

 resolution can be achieved only by a sustained international .  

 parinership.

 P'ji tralia is particularly concerned at the human cost of heavy  national indebtedness which severely compromises development 

 efforts in many countries. Debtors and creditors need to address 

 tv 2 issues raised by that indebtedness in a spirit of 

 international economic cooperation, and in a way which addresses 

 not only the immediate but long term problems of the nation in 

 question. Debt reduction packages should be implemented :.n such 

 a way as to enhance credit-worthiness and new money flows, and to

 10

 support reform programs In heavily indebted countries.

 Australia believes firmly that, whatever may be the contribution 

 jf debt reduction arid development cooperation programs, the 

 expansion of global trade is central to economic growth and 

 development.

 The Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations under GATT â  '  · / · 

 auspices is fundamentally about creating a more secure, stable 

 and open international economic environment. The GATT provides a 

 framework of rights and obligations within which economic 

 ambition can be channelled to the benefit of all countries, and 

 not just the few most powerful. This is why the success of the 

 Uruguay Round is so important. Between now and the final 

 Ministerial Meeting in Brussels in December, all participants in 

 the negotiations will have to intensify their efforts, and 

 develop more of a spirit of compromise than has so far been

 evident, if a successful outcome is to be achieved. Nobody 

 should be in any doubt that failure would be disastrous for the 

 vorld trading economy, for all the developing nations dependent 

 on selling their commodities in the international marketplace,

 and, indeed, for all the people we represent.

 * * *

 In addition to the abiding issues of security and economic 

 development, there is a "third agenda" of problems now being 

 given much increased prominence in international relations -problems that are either too big for each country to solve 

 individually or which are of a character that global action or 

 global pressure can very much help to solve. In areas such as 

 threats to the global environment, health problems like AIDS, the 

 illicit narcotics trade, and the problem of refugees and 

 displaced persons, global interdependence is an omnipresent 

 reality, and multilateral diplomacy an indispensable necessity. 

 The era which we are entering is marked by the multiplication of

 11

 :iuch problems, and the quality of life of the people we represent 

 â¢ill be very much determined by our ability to solve them.

 The global Ï.Î·Î³- i  torment is certainly one of the key international 

 issues of the 1990s. We are now working towards the 1992 UN 

 Conference on Environment and Development which should deal with 

 these two issues in an integrated way. The Conference will not 

 succeed, however, unless considerably more effort is put into 

 reconciling the conflicts between environmental and economic 

 development policies. The two are not inconsistent: the goal of 

 'sustainable development’  can be achieved. But if the UN is to 

 lead international efforts in this sphere, we must stop 

 discussing the processes and start debating the substance. For 

 the UN to make the most constructive input into solving these 

 problems, there has to be greater coordination between UN 

 environment agencies, such as UNEP, and UN development agencies, 

 such as UNDP and UNCTAD. There is no obvious need for more 

 agencies and institutions to deal with these issues; we dfl need 

 to strengthen our existing institutions and improve 

 communications and coordination between them.

 Australia is a strong supporter of the Antarctic Treaty System, 

 which reflects the principles and purposes of the UN Charter and 

 has brought peace, stability and remarkable international 

 cooperation to a very special region bf the globe. Moves are now 

 under way, with strong support from Australia, for the 

 establishment within the Treaty System of a far-sighted 

 comprehensive environmental protection regime, one aspect of 

 which would hopefully be a permanent ban on mining and oil 

 drilling within the region, to guarantee once and for all the 

 permanence of its uniquely fragile and irreplacable environment,

 I would urge those countries not presently involved in these 

 discussions but interested in promoting environmental protection 

 in Antarctica to join the Antarctic Treaty, for it is only 

 through that framework that an effective regime can and will be 

 put in place.

 12

 Two other Issues directly and immediately affecting the lives of 

 individual citizens also particularly require concerted 

 international action. The 1990s have been declared the Decade 

 against Drug Abuse; Australia will continue to strive - in 

 multilateral forums, with bilateral assistance, and by domestic 

 action - to reverse the growth of this menace. In the global 

 struggle against the pandemic, Australia has supported the 

 World Health Organisation’s central coordinating role and is 

 providing financial assistance to the W H O ’s Global Plan on AIDS 

 for the development of national AIDS programs, particularly in 

 South East Asia, and the Pacific and Indian Ocean island 

 countries.

 Human rights issues generally remain very much part of the new 

 international agenda. The most important factor in establishing 

 human rights in this new era will be the spread of democracy to 

 those parts of the world where democratic freedoms are still 

 unknown. The growth of democracy in East Europe has already seen 

 an encouraging reduction in East-West confrontation in the 

 international human rights arena. We have welcomed,  in 

 particular, a new spirit of co-operation in the Commission on 

 Human Rights.

 Unfortunately, the record in human rights in all too many parts 

 of the world has not been all positive over the past year.  

 Australia is appalled at the treatment of innocent civilians 

 caught up in the Gulf crisis, and condemns in the strongest terms 

 restrictions imposed by the Government of Iraq on the freedom of 

 movement of hostages held in that country and in Kuwait.  Closer 

 to home, Australia is also concerned with continuing restrictions 

 on democratic and individual freedoms in both China and Myanmar,  

 and we appeal to all involved in the situation in Sri Lanka to 

 end the cycle of violence which is destroying the fabric of 

 society in that nation. We frankly acknowledge that Australia’s 

 own past is not without blemish in regard to human rights, in

 13

 particular concerning the treatment of Aboriginal and Torres 

 Strait islander people. However we have progressed along the 

 path of rectifying those injustices, we welcome international 

 scrutiny of our efforts, and are prepared to engage in dialogue 

 with any interested country at any time on such issues. Me take 

 the view that the question of conformity to international human 

 rights standards is not each country's own internal business, but 

 the world’s business.

 * * *

 I said at the outset that, as we move beyond the post-War era, 

 the world has been given a second chance. This body, the United 

 Nations Organisation, has also been given a second chance, and 

 we, its members, have to ensure that it is capable of grasping 

 this opportunity. In many ways, the founders of the United 

 Nations were farsighted and built structures that will now stand 

 us in good stead. In other respects, it is clear that they could 

 not have foreseen the circumstances of this new era and we should 

 not shy away from change, from the discarding of long established 

 conventions and procedures and from the creation of new 

 structures and new ways of doing things which better suit the new 

 times. Our guiding criterion should be that we wish the UN to be 

 effective and influence events rather than be passively shaped 

 and overwhelmed by them.

 One area in which demands on the UN are obviously likely to grow 

 in the new era is the performance of conflict resolution and 

 peace-keeping functions. Indeed already over the past two years, 

 five peace-keeping operations have been established and several 

 others foreshadowed, including of course the comprehensive effort 

 that will be required in Cambodia. The peace-keeping function is 

 still hampered by political, legal, financial and administrative 

 problems. Australia advocates the need for greater efficiency 

 and economy in peace-keeping and for the whole peace-keeping area 

 of UN activity to be put on a firmer financial and administrative

 14

 footing.  I welcome the steps the Secretary-General has recently 

 taken to improve co-ordination and financing of peace-keeping, 

 but note :bat still more needs to be done.

 There is an urgent need to improve the ability of the United 

 Nations not only to service the demands of its members in regard 

 to peace-keeping and peace-making, but also to deal with the 

 major new issues of global interdependence. These major issues 

 must be taken up more substantively and effectively than they are 

 currently in the many different intergovernmental forums of the 

 UN's economic and social sector, and this sector needs to be 

 drastically restructured if we are to see the same revival in the 

 economic aspects of the UN's role that we have seen on political 

 issues. Equally, there must be better central coordination and 

 clearer common purpose among the various agencies and bodies of 

 the UN, if each is to play its proper role in attacking 

 multisectoral problems that can be solved only if they act 

 together.

 As far as the organisation as a whole is concerned, universal 

 membership should remain our central principle. In this 

 connection, Australia regards as a relic of the past era the 

 continued absence from the ranks of UN members of the two Koreas. 

 The Republic of Korea has stated its desire to become a full 

 member and we support admission of both Korean States either 

 simultaneously or separately.

 The resolutions of this organ of the UN, the General Assembly,  

 embody the views of the broad membership of the organisation. We 

 need to make better use of these Annual Sessions of our General 

 membership. Let us not be reluctant to remove from our agenda 

 many items that are there by custom, and get rid of many time- 

 wasting, if time-honoured, procedures. Let us use this Assembly 

 to set the norms and standards of correct international behaviour 

 in this new era.

 15

 /

 The security Council is showing us how well it can work. At the 

 same time, we have to acknowledge that the world has changed 

 since 1945 and that there will be increasing and legitimate 

 pressure to ensure that the membership of the Council better 

 accords with today's realities. In any consideration of 

 restructuring, our principal concern must be for the 

 effectiveness of the Council and we need to be certain that what 

 we do enhances and does not risk undermining the efficiency witn 

 which the Security Council is currently able to undertake its 

 central role in international peace and security.

 The Secretariatf  which itself has in the past been the victim of 

 Cold War pressure, requires re-examination to ensure that its  structures and its methods of recruiting its top people, both men  and women, are best suited to the needs of the organisation in  the new ez-a, when the demands upcn them will grown ever more 

 immense.

 * * *

 Two years ago, when I first addressed the United Nations as  Australian Foreign Minister, I drew inspiration from the Charter  and from the important role my great Australian Labor 

 predecessor, Dr Herbert Vere Evatt, played in the founding of the  United Nations. I continue to carry in my mind his vision as to 

 what the institution he helped create should achieve - peace,  justice and decent standards of living for all the peoples of the 

 world.

 The nations of the world, are now entering a new era of 

 cooperation; we are breaking new ground as we at last accept in 

 full our international responsibility to meet aggression and to  resolve regional disputes. And in doing this- we have recommitted  ourselves and our countries to pursue peace and to end human  suffering - not in an ad hoc, almost accidental manner, but as

 part c-f a growing international determination that wa cart make no 

 excuses to our constituents, or to our children, if these goals 

 of peace ar.d development cannot be achieved.

 This Organisation at last holds out to its members the precise  its founders, envisaged. But that promise will not be self- 

 fulfilling. It ia the historic obligation on us. the members of 

 the United Nations, to. take up et this time and build cn the new 

 spirit of international cooperation, to bend our efforts to 

 bolster the new multilateral framework for global peace and 

 security, to-act vigorously on the economic challenges before vs, 

 end to tackle cooperatively all the social ar>d environmental and 

 health issues which demand global remedies. We have another 

 opportunity to put it right, and this time it rust not be lest.
