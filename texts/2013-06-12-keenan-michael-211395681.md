 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Scott Morrison 

 Another boat as cost of Labor's border failure spreads 

 Wednesday 12th June 2013 

 Another illegal boat, with 69 people on board, comes as the cost and burden of Labor’s border failure 

 spreads further into health services, state governments and the community, Shadow Minister for 

 Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border 

 Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 “Labor has sought to push the consequences of their failed border protection policies out into the 

 community with their no care, no responsibility bridging visa policy and now the cost of that is being borne 

 out through added strain to health services, increased expenses to state governments and a bigger burden 

 for the charity and not for profit welfare sectors,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “At the same time as Julia Gillard is forcing taxpayers to fork out over $10 billion in blow outs thanks to her 

 failed border protection policies, she is now making them wear further strain on the health budget, state 

 government services and pressure on charities, as over 3,000 people arrive illegally by boat a month on 

 her watch. 

 “The longer this government remains in office the bigger the reach of the negative impact of their failed 

 border protection policies and the bigger the cost for taxpayers. 

 “This is why if the Coalition is elected we will reinstate a full suite of proven border protection policies, with 

 the necessary resolve, to stop the boats,” Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr Keenan said: “This latest illegal boat arrival carrying 69 people, the 14th to arrive in June thus far, has 

 come at a time when Border Protection Command (BPC) are passed the point of being stretched beyond 

 capacity. 

 “Already more than twice the amount of boats have arrived so far this year compared with this time in 2012, 

 with 170 boats carrying 11,805 people having arrived so far in 2013. 

 “The Coalition appreciates that the hardworking men and women of BPC are doing the best job they can 

 under the turbulent circumstances that have been created by this Labor Government. 

 “Given the fact that Labor cut $14 million from Customs’ Border Protection and Enforcement Program in the 

 2013-14 Budget it is hardly surprising that BPC cannot keep up with this deluge of illegal arrivals,” Mr 

 Keenan said.
