 Australia's Aid Budget: Promoting Growth and Stability in the Asia Pacific Region

 I am pleased to announce that Australia will provide $1.815 billion as official development assistance (ODA) in 2002-03, an increase of $90 million over the 2001-02 budget figure ($1.725 billion) and a real increase of 3 per cent. This is an ODA/GNI ratio of 0.25 per cent, placing Australia consistently above the donor average which in the latest year available (2001) was 0.22 per cent.

 The Australian aid programme will continue to advance our national interest by assisting de-veloping countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development. In 2002-03, Australia's aid programme will retain its strong focus on the Asia-Pacific region where it makes an important contribution to regional peace and stability as well as to poverty reduction. By promoting economic growth and good governance, the aid programme will assist in combating poverty in our region and ensure effective delivery of aid through encouraging in-stitutions which are transparent and accountable.
