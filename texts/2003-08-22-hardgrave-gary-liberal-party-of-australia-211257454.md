 Minister Launches Australian Citizenship Day in Queensland and Pays Tribute  to Migrants And Refugees

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, today launched the  2003 Australian Citizenship Promotion campaign and paid tribute to the migrants and  refugees who started new lives in Australia at the Wacol Migrant Centre in Brisbane.

 Mr Hardgrave said there were 168,230 people in Queensland residentially eligible to  become Australian citizens and the Gold Coast alone was home to around 32,460 eligible  non-citizens.

 'Although people can apply for Australian Citizenship at any time, I encourage these people,  who are among about 900,000 people throughout Australia who are residentially eligible to  take out citizenship, to use the lead up to Australian Citizenship Day on 17 September to  apply,' Mr Hardgrave said. 

 In launching the Wacol Remembered publication, Mr Hardgrave acknowledged its  importance, not only to those who lived there from 1949 to 1987, but to all Australians.

 'The publication comprises stories in the words of the residents, service providers and  volunteers,' Mr Hardgrave said.

 'These people were pioneers - and many agree that coming to Australia is the best thing  they ever did and they have great pride in being Australian.'

 Mr Hardgrave, with the chairman of the Ethnic Communities Council of Queensland, Mr  Serge Voloschenko OAM, also presented 18 seniors with certificates of Australian  Citizenship during a citizenship ceremony at the event.

 'This ceremony proves that you're never too young or old to become an Australian citizen.  With Australian Citizenship Day just around the corner, there's never been a better time to  become an Australian citizen,' Mr Hardgrave said.

 'Australian citizenship is the cornerstone of our society and the bond that unites us as a  nation. It holds our culturally diverse nation together.'
