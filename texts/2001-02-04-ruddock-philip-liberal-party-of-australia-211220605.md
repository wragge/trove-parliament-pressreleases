 Misleading Information Over Detainee Processing MPS 011/2001

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today that misinformation was being promoted to suggest that the Government had not addressed processing times for unlawful arrivals.

 "The Government has devoted extra staff and resources to address the huge jump in the number of unlawful boat arrivals in the past 18 months. Processes have also been reviewed and strengthened to deal quickly with the higher volumes of claims for protection. As a result, processing times for asylum claims have come down significantly," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Since mid-1999, the number of trained staff allocated to processing asylum claims has more than doubled. While 80% of protection claims made by boat arrivals in late 1999 received a decision within seven and a half months, this had reduced to less than 15 weeks for applications made in late 2000.

 "Where a case has gone to the RRT, processing times have consistently averaged less than 70 days.

 "If people present strong and credible claims for asylum, these can be dealt with quickly, but there are numbers who have at best, marginal claims and will pursue their cases through merits appeal and litigation. Once applicants go to litigation, their cases can take years to be resolved, but that is not within the Government's control.

 "There are also a number of asylum seekers who raise character, security and health concerns, which can add considerably to their stay in detention," Mr Ruddock said.

 In calendar year 2000, 3,770 people were released from detention on Temporary Protection Visas. Of the 1,118 detainees waiting for a decision on their asylum claims, over 800 have been in detention for less than 6 weeks. A further 367 detainees have been found not to be refugees and are pursuing review and litigation opportunities. The remaining 888 detainees are awaiting removal, having either not made asylum claims or having had claims exhaustively examined and rejected.

 "The Government has no desire to keep people in detention for any longer than is necessary, but where people arrive with false or no documents or present marginal claims, they will spend longer in detention," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Many other countries are increasingly moving towards detention of unlawful arrivals and those countries without mandatory detention often experience great difficulty in locating failed asylum seekers when it is time for their removal.

 "I am still examining the options for alternative detention arrangements for children and will be making announcements on that in the near future," Mr Ruddock said.
