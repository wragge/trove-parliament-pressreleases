  Media Release

  The Hon Duncan Kerr, MP

  Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs

  

 November 8, 1999

  

  Roo shooter is first to spot illegal immigrants

  

  “Amanda Vanstone’s claim that the Government is detecting boat 
people before they arrive on shore is plainl y false,” Shadow 
Justice Minister Duncan Kerr said today.

  

 Senator Vanstone has said: “  Our surveillance measures, we as good as you can get. We are picking 
up these boats before they arrive on our shores so our measures to deel 
with people when they arrive are close to 100 per cent (West Australian 
8-11-99) .”

  

 “How does the Senator reconcile the fact that 25 
illegal immigrants were recently found wandering around in the Kimberleys?” 
said Mr Kerr.

  

 “The Government did not know how or when they arrived, 
and whether it was by boat or plane.

  

 “And how does Senator Vanstone explain to the Australian 
public that it was a kangaroo shooter who was the first to stumble across 
four illegal immigrants recently?

  

 “We have had so far this year a newsagent, a green 
keeper, a surfer, and now a roo shooter as our front line patrol to 
guard our shores.

  

 “Three boats carrying 519 people have landed at 
Ashmore Reef in the past week. There are an estimated 2000 people waiting 
in Indonesia to travel illegally to Australia.

  

 “Australia is seen as a soft target for people smugglers. 
I share with the WA Premier and Mayor of Derby the concern that people 
smugglers could also be coming into Western Australia by air using airstrips 
from WWII no longer in use and out of our surveillance sights.

  

 “There are disused airstrips all over the country 
which could be used to smuggle people, as well as drugs and guns. This 
is a national security issue which is being ignored by the Government.

  

 “The Labor Party is urging the Government to take 
seriously the option to establish an integrated Australian Coastguard.”
