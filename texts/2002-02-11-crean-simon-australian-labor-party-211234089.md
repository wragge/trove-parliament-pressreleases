 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 11th FEBRUARY 2002.

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 Subjects: ALP Caucus; asylum seekers; mandatory detention, ALP policy                  framework

 CREAN: Today the Caucus endorsed a framework for an approach on asylum seekers, which is tough on border protection but compassionate. The paper that they’ve endorsed involves four new initiatives in relation to asylum seekers. These initiatives are that the running of the detention centres should revert to Commonwealth control. Second, that the Woomera detention centre be mothballed. This is in accordance with the recommendation of the Government’s own independent advisory group and based on their assertion that the detainees in Woomera can be accommodated in other facilities. The third area that we’ve adopted today is greater transparency in regard to the detention facilities in particular the ability for the media to access them subject to appropriate protocols. And the fourth area that we’ve adopted today is to extend the relocation allowance to all Afghanis and if it helps the resettlement of other nationalities then consideration be given to extending it to them as well. So they’re the four new policy initiatives that Caucus has endorsed today. In addition to that the framework for the ongoing debate associated with the issue of mandatory detention, the continuation of the ‘‘Pacific Solution’’, the temporary protection visas, these are all issues that further discussion, consideration and information is required on. But the Caucus has endorsed the framework in this paper, which will be made available, as the basis upon which that further consideration be given.

 JOURNALIST: When you say it’s more accountability open and access. Media already have access to detention centres to a degree, how would you go beyond that? Would we have access to detainees themselves?

 CREAN: Well subject to appropriate protocols we think the Government’s clamming up on media access is inappropriate. We think the more information that is known about these without sensationalising it, the more information that’s available, the better. No point trying to hide it. And once you start trying to restrict access to the media, all sorts of stories emerge. I might say,

 we’re very pleased today with the decision of the Government to allow the United Nations High Commissioner access to the facility.

 JOURNALIST: But there’s no change to mandatory detention for illegal asylum seekers?

 CREAN: Everyone in the Caucus accepts the need for the continuation of some form of mandatory detention. Some express concern about that terminology but all accept the fact that people arriving here should be subject to detention until their security, their health, their risk assessment has been determined.

 JOURNALIST: What about a time limit?

 CREAN: I will come to that in a minute. So whilst some might argue the terminology, they don’t argue against that principle, nor do they argue against the need for an ongoing detention in circumstances in which people’s status have been determined that those individuals are still considered a risk to our community.

 JOURNALIST: So have the likes of Carmen Lawrence…

 CREAN: Hang on. Can I just finish the question? Because I think it’s important. Within the concept of mandatory detention there is also a recognition there are different forms of detention. Issues that still need to be given further consideration. Some forms of community release for example, the length of time it takes to process, the types of resources made available. These are all issues for ongoing consideration by the Labor Party.

 JOURNALIST: (inaudible) …talk about fourteen weeks at one point or you mentioned…(inaudible).

 CREAN: Been a number of different dates or times mentioned. The Parliamentary Committee on the previous occasion, have talked of the fourteen weeks. We want to look at whether that period itself can be shortened. There’s some suggestion it might be. But, rather than try and define a time now we think it’s better to give it proper consideration but we’re signalling that in the issue of mandatory detention the question of the conditions under which people are kept, the nature of the detention if you like and its duration. They’re obviously matters for further consideration.

 JOURNALIST: (Inaudible)

 CREAN: Well the purpose of this was not to silence anyone. It was to provide a framework in which we….

 JOURNALIST: They have been outspoken in their criticism, in their criticism of the mandatory detention.

 CREAN: The purpose of today’s discussion was to get a framework in which all members of the Party can participate appropriately. That we have achieved today.

 JOURNALIST: Was it unanimous?

 CREAN: It was not unanimous but it was overwhelmingly supported.

 JOURNALIST: So they accept mandatory detention but don’t support mandatory detention, is that right?

 CREAN: No you’re trying to put words into…

 JOURNALIST: Well there’s a difference between actively supporting something and then just accepting the fact that it’s Labor Party line (inaudible).

 CREAN: It’s not a question of toeing a party line. It’s a question of being part of a decision making process that’s arrived at four important new initiatives today and a framework for progressing the others. Now on the issue of mandatory detention we still remain committed to the retention of mandatory, but it’s its nature and duration that we’re prepared to consider changes to it.

 JOURNALIST: You seem to have taken a long time to reach not much of a conclusion.  What kept you in there for so long?

 CREAN: Well, on this issue I don’t think we started discussion of the asylum seeker, the refugee issue, until sometime after 4 o’clock.  There are other matters to transact I think you would accept in terms of our first Caucus meeting for the year.  There is legislation that we had to consider and we’ve done all of that today.  But I think if you ask around you will find that it was a very constructive debate, everyone had their opportunity for a say and I think that people are now very satisfied about the new framework in which this debate can proceed.  But significantly important new initiatives announced today, I think, will help advance the debate as well.

 JOURNALIST: What about support for the ‘‘Pacific Solution’’ will that remain?

 CREAN: The ‘‘Pacific Solution’’ is one of those issues, I said before, that needs further consideration by us.  I think that there is a general, there is a view and this paper indicates that it is not sustainable in the long-term.  There are issues of its cost which we believe are important to establish because if the ‘‘Pacific Solution’’ is not going to remain there needs to be something else put in place and you can’t start offering alternatives until you

 4

 have some idea as to what the cost alternative is against the background of the cost of the ‘‘Pacific Solution’’.

 JOURNALIST: So when Dr Lawrence addresses the protest rally this week what will she be allowed to say?  Does she have to endorse mandatory detention now?

 CREAN: What she will be able, obviously to do, is to speak in support of the changes that Labor is making to its policy, changes already announced, and the process for further consideration of the issues identified in the framework.

 JOURNALIST: So therefore aren’t you really silencing the critics on the issues?

 CREAN: We’re not silencing people at all.  We’re giving them a framework in which they can go and argue the case.  You see this is not a debate about silencing people this is a debate about trying to find constructive solutions.  The Government has not been serious about coming up with constructive solutions.  It simply wants to blame the victims on all of the circumstance.  We believe there has to be a lasting solution.  There has to be a whole range of considerations not just associated with those in detention now but the dealing of the problem at source.  The range of processes particularly CHOGM, the Bali conference all of these things in which the proper framework for processing can be put in place for the future.  We want a lasting solution.  We want solutions not silence.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, are you leaving the way open for Labor to have a more lenient position on mandatory detention than the Government?

 CREAN: Labor remains committed to mandatory detention.  We argue that there are issues within mandatory detention that need further consideration.  They go to duration, they go to the circumstances, the nature of the detention.  There are clearly different circumstances attaching to different people and there are clearly different forms the detention can take.

 JOURNALIST: Does that mean community release programs for example?

 CREAN: Community release programs obviously have to be part of the consideration - the document says so.

 JOURNALIST: How long before your policy will be finished…?

 CREAN: Well I think that it’s important to get it right.  I don’t want to be tied down in terms of a timetable.  Today was an important start. The Caucus has overwhelmingly endorsed it - I now want the Caucus to get

 5

 on with the further consideration of the other issues that now need ongoing attention.

 JOURNALIST: How many people refused to endorsed the framework today?

 CREAN: Not many.  Very few.

 JOURNALIST: This evening several television networks have broadcast footage apparently taking prior, leaked footage, apparently taking prior to the Port Hedland riot last year which show a man and his son, teenage son, being manhandled and forcibly separated, you probably haven’t seen the footage?

 CREAN: No I haven’t seen it.

 JOURNALIST: I am wondering how urgent, how concerned are you about the quality of the administration and how urgent is it, do you think, that the detention centre administration returns to government hands?

 CREAN: I think as soon as possible and it’s timely to be able to do it fairly soon, Laurie, because all of the detention centres are up for tender at the moment.  There’s no reason why in that context the Government can’t make a decision to return them to the control of a government agency. That’s where it’s appropriate that these facilities be run, that’s what we’re calling on the Government to do.

 JOURNALIST: …that footage. How concerned are you about what has been reported over time is been going on behind, inside those centres?

 CREAN: Well we are obviously concerned about it that’s why we say that this needs to be reviewed.  But I think that the, what gives us the opportunity to call for the running of these detention facilities to be in government control is the tender process.  It’s timely, what we need is for the Government to act.

 JOURNALIST: In the lead up to the election Labor’s support for mandatory detention was unconditional.  Are you now saying that you could place conditions on that support?

 CREAN: I’m saying that we remain committed to mandatory detention.  What I am saying is that, and I have said this for sometime, that the length of time of processing people and the different circumstances associated with people in detention needs to be taken into account.  I think I said some weeks ago that we should be looking at streaming, for example, within detention facilities.  There is obviously an argument to look at issues like community release but that has to be considered properly and comprehensively.  We’re prepared to look at it and come forward with further initiatives in the future.

 JOURNALIST: So you are softening Labor’s position to what it took to the election and you are leaving way open for a further softening on this position in the future?

 CREAN: We are changing the policy as part of the review process that we said that we would undertake.  It’s not softening on border protection, what it’s doing is far more effectively getting the balance right between border protection and compassion.  That was a proposition that we hoped would have been the basis for the Government’s policy position.  But whilst it has been tough on the border it has been light on the compassion.

 JOURNALIST: The community release program surely is a softening of mandatory detention policy.

 CREAN: Well let me say this: we have not yet adopted community release.  We have said that we are prepared to consider it.  We remain committed to the retention of mandatory detention but we believe that there are issues associated with mandatory detention but go to issues such as the duration that go to the issues of the circumstances, the nature of the detention that deserve, require further consideration.

 JOURNALIST: How soon do you want Woomera mothballed?

 CREAN: Well I think that that’s a question that we would take advice from the independent detention agency group, the Government’s own independent body.  It talked about phasing down.  Mothballing means it can still be there if it is needed in the future but given the circumstances surrounding Woomera and the advice of the independent body and there advice that the detainees can be accommodated in other facilities we believe that should be done in accordance with their recommendation.

 Ends.
