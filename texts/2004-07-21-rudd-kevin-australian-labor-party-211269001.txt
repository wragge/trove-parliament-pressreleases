 TIME FOR AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ACTION ON THE SUDAN   

 The Howard Government now justifies the Iraq war on the basis of humanitarian  intervention because the Iraqi WMD and the link between Iraq and September 11 arguments  collapsed.   

 In the spirit of this newfound interest in humanitarianism, it is time for Mr Downer to  elevate the importance of the humanitarian crisis in the Sudan.   

 According to the US Agency for International Development, Darfur is undergoing ‘the worst  humanitarian crisis in the world today’. It estimates 300,000 Sudanese refugees could die of  starvation, disease or ethnic cleansing if aid does not arrive soon. The UN has warned the  attacks by militias on civilians could rival the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.   

 So far it is estimated that more than 10,000 people have died and an estimated one million  people have been displaced.   

 The international community is now attaching some priority to the crisis in the Sudan. Colin  Powell visited Khartoum in June, German Foreign Minister Fischer will visit Sudan this  month and a British Parliamentary delegation has just returned from the Darfur region  recommending an intensification of humanitarian assistance.   

 The US ($220m), the UK ($62.5m) and Canada ($23m) have led the humanitarian effort. The  Australian Government has made two contributions totalling $8 million to be administered  through various NGOs and UN agencies.   

 This contribution is inadequate given the dimensions of the current crisis and in light of the  NGO appeal launched today by the UK’s Disasters Emergency Committee.   

 Mr Downer should immediately treble his emergency aid contribution to the Sudan using  AusAID’s Humanitarian and Emergency Program and as a matter of urgency visit Khartoum  and Darfur to gain a first hand assessment of which agencies could make best use of this  funding on the ground.   

 If Mr Downer cries poor, he should act in Cabinet to have the Government reduce by 10 per  cent the $120m-plus money it is now spending on tax-payer funded self-promotion.   

 It is high time Mr Downer started focusing on his job as Foreign Minister rather than acting  as a third rate commentator on the on ALP, the US and Iraq.  Ends. 21 July 2004  Media contact: Alister Jordan 0417 605 823
