 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - CANBERRA, 4 DECEMBER 2002

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 Subjects: Pre-emptive strikes; JI Olympic attack; Asylum seeker policy; ASIO Bill; The Ashes; Peter Garrett

 CREAN: The Prime Minister’s comments on pre-emptive strikes are now endangering the capacity to bring cooperation in our region to fight terrorism.  I think the response from the Philippines is particularly concerning - their preparedness to tear up the joint agreement to fight terrorism in the wake of the statements.  You can’t build the cooperation and peace in the region if what you’re doing is talking war.  And the Prime Minister simply has to retract from these statements and has to start again contacting each of these nations to indicate that either his statements were misinterpreted or to reaffirm his commitment to build cooperation.

 The War on Terror is something we have to engage in, because the threat of terror is real.  It’s in our region and we can only tackle it by regional cooperation to defeat it.  We’ve got to build the basis for cooperation, build the basis for peace, and you don’t do that by talking up war.

 JOURNALIST: With regards to Malaysia, how seriously should we take Dr Mahathir’s talk of acts of war and so forth, considering his long-held antipathy towards Australia?

 CREAN: Well, I think we have to weigh that latter dimension in any of the statements from Dr Mahathir, but I think his reaction on this has to be taken seriously.  It has to be weighed against those other factors, but it’s not just Dr Mahathir.  It’s the Philippines.  As I understand it, Thailand has expressed concern, but been discreet about it.  This is not just Dr Mahathir. This is a concern in the region at what the Prime Minister’s statements mean.

 Now, it’s all very well for the Prime Minister to stand here and say he didn’t mean it and that the neighbours in the region fully understand what he is saying.  They don’t understand what he’s saying.  They’re seeing, they’re interpreting it as support for pre-emptive strikes, and they don’t want that.

 In the way in which the world reacted to George Bush threatening pre-emptive strikes against Iraq, the region is reacting against John Howard being seen to threaten pre-emptive strikes in the region.  The Prime Minister has to back away from this.  He has to contact the leaders of these countries and set the record straight and lay the basis again for cooperation to fight terrorism together in our region.

 JOURNALIST: When he had the chance, though, he - rather than back away - he only reinforced his statements.  He shows no signs of backing away at all.

 CREAN: Well, it’s his judgement that’s wrong in this, terribly wrong. And he can’t have it both ways.  He can’t say that he’s looking for cooperation and support in the region if the people he’s looking for that cooperation and support from are reacting as they are to his statements.

 JOURNALIST: The Prime Minister denies that his comments have caused any offence to our Asian neighbours.  What’s the problem here?  Is he ignorant?  Is he too flippant?

 CREAN: He’s a Prime Minister in denial.  You only have to look at the responses from our neighbours in our region.  They’re concerned about them - so much so that some are suggesting that the basis for cooperation to fight terrorism will not be proceeded with.  Now, that’s got to be of concern to us as a nation.  It’s in our national interests that we have regional cooperation to fight the War on Terror.  That’s what a Prime Minister has got to do.  He’s got to build the peace, not just talk up war.

 JOURNALIST: What do you make of stories or reports that a JI person was planning an attack on the Olympics?  Have you sought a briefing on that?

 CREAN: I have, and I’ve got no further information on that.  I seek briefings on all of these things when the reports are made.  Certainly nothing that’s been reported to me to date would support that claim.

 JOURNALIST: So they’re saying that it’s not true?  That’s your understanding?

 CREAN: I’m saying I’ve sought a briefing on the specifics, but nothing I’ve had beforehand would lead me to conclude that the claim itself was real.

 JOURNALIST: There’s some suggestion that the idea was leaked because Asian authorities were wanting to punish John Howard for his comments on a pre-emptive strike, and that there are terrorists actually here.

 CREAN: Yes, I don’t know.  I mean, I just can’t comment on that. What I can comment on is the very real reaction that has come from our

 neighbours to the Prime Minister talking pre-emptive strikes.  And deny it he might, but he’s got a problem in the region and he has to deal with it.  He can’t pretend they’re misinterpreting him if they are all reacting the way they are.  There’s only one solution for him, and that’s to get on the phone and clear up the mess.  This is a Government that made inappropriate statements before in relation to the war on Iraq, when they accused those of us who said, ‘You need to settle it through the UN’, as appeasers and talking like Saddam Hussein.  He was forced to back down on that.  Now, here is an example where he’s talking pre-emptive strikes, interpreted in the region as potentially threatening to them.  He’s got to address it if he is going to build the cooperation that is desperately needed in the region for us to fight terrorism together.

 JOURNALIST: What do you make of the Government softening its policy on asylum seekers yesterday?

 CREAN: Well, I think that this is welcome. It has taken them a long time.  Getting the kids out from behind the razor wire is something that I called for back on Australia day, the 26th of January, this year. So the Government has followed the direction that Labor has led on, but it has taken them almost 12 months. Labor has led further in the policy announcements that I put out yesterday. And I would hope that there is direction in there that the Government would also pick up.  And actually read the document, rather than just try and bag it before they have had the chance to digest it.

 JOURNALIST: How was that policy received in the party room?

 CREAN: Well, it was a very constructive discussion yesterday in the party room. It was civil.  It was genuinely designed to inform people about the detail. I welcome that, because it is a very comprehensive document. It is very well thought through and involves a lot of consultation. There will be the debate tomorrow in the [Caucus]. There are differences of opinion about the judgement you come to on the final policy, but that will be determined tomorrow. But I am very pleased with the way in which the matter is progressing in the party room.

 JOURNALIST: Have you found the opponents are willing to negotiate?

 CREAN: I have found that the opponents are willing to engage in the discussion, to get further clarification, and to continue to talk the matter through.

 The other good news that came through last night was the report of the Senate Committee into the ASIO Bills. This report now lays the basis for us getting the right balance on the ASIO Bills - giving the additional powers that are needed to fight terror without turning Australia into a police state.

 Now on the Anti-Terror Bills, the Prime Minister admitted that we got the balance right. And that balance was because Labor stood its ground, argued its case through the parliamentary process, and got important changes to the legislation. Labor has stood its ground again on the ASIO Bills.  It has argued them through the Senate processes, and there is now a report that lays the basis for the ASIO Bills to go through the Parliament. All it requires now is for the Government to embrace those changes and we could have the Bill through expeditiously.

 JOURNALIST: But Daryl Williams was quite cold on the idea this morning…

 CREAN: Daryl Williams is a cold man. Daryl Williams needs some warming up. Daryl Williams does need something in his life to encourage him to look more kindly on these things and embrace the well meaning changes that are being put forward. I am sure that if Daryl Williams sits down and looks through these initiatives constructively, he can’t ignore the basis on which they are argued. Importantly, though, he can’t ignore the fact that there are people in his own party that support the changes.

 JOURNALIST: So Labor would support the detention of people who could possibly have some information about terrorism for up to seven days if there were those additional safeguards?

 CREAN: The safeguards that go to the access to the lawyers, the length of time for the questioning, and the 48-hour trip. These are important safeguards, but they do allow ASIO and the Federal Police to go about their work.

 JOURNALIST: Can I just ask you - the Prime Minister - on a totally different matter, which might seem irrelevant in the current times that we are living in.  The Prime Minister has thrown his support on the Ashes being brought to Australia. Would you support that?

 CREAN: Absolutely. If you win the trophy, it should come here. And we have been winning it for a long time.  It should have been here for a long time. But just about every other great sporting activity operates on the basis that the winner claims the trophy and houses the trophy. That is what should happen to the Ashes.

 JOURNALIST: Can I ask you - Peter Garrett has left Midnight Oil. Would he be welcome into the Labor Party at any stage?

 CREAN: Oils ain’t oils anymore. So it is a sad day, but Peter Garrett, of course, I think would be welcome to any cause that we know he holds so passionately. I don’t know what his political ambitions are, quite frankly.  I have not spoken about this with him.  I have spoken to him on many occasions over the years, and particularly since I have been Leader, on a lot

 of matters associated with the environment - because I genuinely believe that we don’t just have to be a strong economy, we have to be a sustainable one. And I welcome his advice in that direction and I will continue to seek it. He has an important role as chairman of the ACF and I will continue to talk to him. I will just have to listen to the old tracks if he is not producing any more.

 JOURNALIST: The latest Newspoll shows that John Howard’s popularity is at its highest in six years.  Is that fairly daunting for you?  Do you see yourself ever bridging that gap?

 CREAN: Well, we will bridge it by the time of the next election. That is my task. Opposition and the term of opposition is a marathon run, not a sprint. So I think that this week, this last week, you have seen some important policy initiatives coming out from Labor that differentiate us from the Government. The Coastguard, I think, is an important initiative to better protect our borders.  The more humane treatment of asylum seekers is also an important differentiation. You will be seeing a lot more of that differentiation, and that is the basis on which we will be contesting the next election. I look forward to it.

 JOURNALIST: Just quickly, Mr Crean.  This morning there are reports that Australian Muslims are getting leaflets to boycott Sydney companies, in particular, owned by the United States and apparently supporters of Israel. They also claim that the Prime Minister has abandoned them in a time of fear and suspicion around Muslim communities.  Do you agree with that?

 CREAN: I haven’t seen the detail of those comments. All I would urge is for the Muslim community to get strongly behind what the Labor Party has been arguing for, and that is the resolution of the Iraqi situation to be determined through the United Nations. That is now a position that the United States has been required to embrace, and that is the correct course for solving that potential conflict.  Thanks very much.
