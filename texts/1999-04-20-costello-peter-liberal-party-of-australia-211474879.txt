  The Hon. Peter Costello, MP.   
Commonwealth Treasurer

  Address to the   
Official 1999 Red Shield Appeal

  Sydney Town Hall   
Sydney   
Tuesday, 20 April 1999

  

  Thank you for the honour of 
officially opening the 1999 Red Shield Appeal. 

  The Red Shield Appeal is the 
S  alvation Army’s major annual fundraising drive.

  The Business Appeal is one of the three main components 
of this drive complementing the National Doorknock which is held in 
late May and the Direct Mail Campaign. The projected cost of providing 
welfare services nationally for the Salvation Army in the forthcoming 
year is $250 million. Of this 83 per cent comes from Government grants, 
client contributions and institutional fundraising. The 17 per cent 
deficit - $42 million - is the goal of the Red Shield Appeal.

  The only thing that concerned me about accepting 
today’s invitation was when I was informed that this is a budget deficit 
appeal. Budget deficit appeal. As you know budget deficits have no appeal 
for me, so I am hoping that this budget deficit appeal becomes a budget 
surplus appeal. To plagiarise a recent Treasurer’s Budget Speech we 
could call this appeal: 

  "Out of the red and into the black" 

  "Shielded from the red, striding for the black" 

  " Back in the black, right on track"

  All of these phrases came to mind as I was marching 
in an Anzac Day march last Sunday (in my local electorate) as I do on 
an annual basis. 

  Leading the march was the Salvation Army Band, and 
behind it leading the diggers was me.

  Now I am no marcher. And my legs are not standard 
army issue. They’re about 5 inches longer which means with each step 
I crib about 5 inches up on the people in front of me. So I started 
off following the bass drum in the Salvation Army Band at a distance 
of about 10 feet, after 20 paces I was crawling right up his back - 
which made him stop and me stop.

  I could see from the look on his face that he was 
pretty surprised to see the Federal Treasurer in his back pocket. Or 
perhaps not. His hip pocket nerve wasn’t twitching. It was convulsing!

  At the end of the ceremony a number of the bandsmen 
came across to say hello. One I knew - when he took off his officer’s 
cap - as the Director of a major health care provider, another was a 
local pharmacist.

  Who does not recognise the uniform of the Salvation 
Army? Who does not admire it? But do you see the people underneath who 
wear it? Underneath those uniforms are ordinary people. I’m sure they 
would tell you that they are ordinary:- they have family arguments; 
they have minor car accidents; they dislike filling in their tax returns.

  These are ordinary people. They just do extraordinary 
work.

  The Salvation Army was founded by William Booth in 
1865. It is now an international community dedicated to evangelistic 
and social enterprises. A well known Army motto is "With heart 
to God and hand to man".

  The Salvation Army is now represented in every city 
in Australia with some 369 Corps or congregations across the nation 
and a total membership of 74,000 people. You will see the Salvation 
Army running emergency relief programmes, nursing services, family support, 
drug rehabilitation programmes. You will see the Salvation Army outside 
sporting grounds and in the pubs selling the magnificent publication 
"The War Cry". You will see the Salvation Army providing Chaplaincy 
services at Parliament House in Canberra. There may be more deprived 
locations but there are hardly more needy ones!

  Of course when William Booth founded the Salvation 
Army in 1865 there was hardly a social security system in England, Australia 
or anywhere else for that matter. The state did not provide aged pensions. 
The state did not provide unemployment benefits. The state did not provide 
family assistance, disability pensions or universal medical treatment.

  In many respects it was charitable institutions that 
began the first social security system. And throughout the next century 
as the State grew, as its capacity to deliver services grew, as its 
capacity to collect tax grew, social security increasingly became the 
responsibility of the State. 

  And in our country we have one of the most extensive 
social security systems in the world. 

  Does this mean that the role 
of the charity has been usurped by the state? 

  Does this mean that taxpayers 
who contribute to social security through the tax system are free of 
an obligation to contribute voluntarily?

  I think if we went back 30 
or 40 or 50 y  ears many would have answered these questions in 
the affirmative. Many looked forward to a day when the resources of 
the state were great and efficient and when want and hardship could 
be eliminated.

  Yet our experience has taught us that in any social 
security system no matter how well designed, no matter how extensive, 
there will always be people in need and want. Our experience has taught 
us that harnessing the private and charitable impulse delivers to those 
in need at a different level to even the best planned government services. 
Experience tells us somewhere deep down that it is still better to give 
than to receive. 

  So how do we give here in Australia?

  In 1995 the Industry Commission report on charitable 
organisations found that, on a per capita basis, for every donation 
of $1 in Australia charities in the United States raised the equivalent 
of $5.89, charities in Canada raised $1.47 and charities in the United 
Kingdom raised $1.77. It was estimated in 1997 that total donations 
and other fundraising activity for charities was $2.7 billion. 73 per 
cent of this income came from individual donations and bequests and 
the remaining 27 per cent from corporate sponsorship and donations. 

  Individual donations including bequests amount to 
around $219 per tax payer, or $139 per taxpayer excluding bequests

  Total fundraising provides 26% of the income of the 
charities surveyed, with government contributions making up 43% and 
‘other income’ (including fees for service) providing the remaining 
31%.

  ATO tax data indicates that individual taxpayers 
claimed deductions donations totaling $546 million in 1996/97

  Around 34% of taxpayers claimed a deduction with 
an average claim of $173.

  Individuals with taxable incomes of $50,000 or more 
make up 11% of all taxpayers and account for 39% of donations claimed, 
with an average donation of $411 

  We can improve on our giving effort. 

  Building a culture of philanthropy 
in Australia 

  For its part, the Government wants to foster a stronger 
culture of philanthropy in Australia. 

  Facilitating such a culture is a legitimate role 
for government.

  So last month the Government announced a package 
of taxation measures to promote philanthropy. 

  In response to recommendations that emerged from 
the Business and Community Partnerships Initiative the Government announced 
it would remove a number of taxation impediments to individual and corporate 
philanthropy, with measures to come into effect from 1 July 1999. 

  The changes will allow tax deductions for gifts of 
property valued at more than $5,000, regardless of when they were purchased 
or acquired. In contrast, existing law effectively requires donors to 
sell assets that they have held for more then twelve months and donate 
the proceeds, if they wish to obtain a tax deduction. 

  The new measure also provides a deduction for property 
that was not purchased by the owner, such as gifts and inherited items. 

  This measure could initially 
increase donations by around $45 million per annum, at a revenue loss 
of around $20 million per annum.

  In addition, we w  ill provide a capital gains tax exemption for testamentary 
gifts of property to bodies eligible to receive tax deductible donations.

  This change should provide significant support to 
the efforts of charities to cultivate bequests. 

  The Government will also introduce a new category 
of private charitable funds. These funds will be required to meet all 
the existing standards of accountability and public responsibility but 
without the need to seek and receive funds from the public. 

  This measure will provide potential donors with greater 
freedom in the way in which they support philanthropic activities. It 
should foster new partnerships and a closer sense of engagement. 

  Finally, the Government will enhance the incentives 
for donations under the Cultural Gifts Program. Donations accepted by 
the Program will be exempt from capital gains tax.

  There will also be a provision 
that allows deductions for donations under the Program to be apportioned 
over a period of up to five years. This will be of particular benefit 
to donors whose relatively low incomes may otherwise prevent them from 
fully utili  sing the deduction for high value gifts of cultural 
property. 

  Together these measures will provide a significant 
boost to Australian philanthropy, drawing attention to the value of 
contributing to those organisations who protect and service our most 
needy. 

  Volunteering for charity.

  Recently well-known pollster Rod Cameron published 
a piece in the Sydney Morning Herald entitled "I’m all right 
mate and to hell with you".

  It is not uncommon for the older generation to be 
despairing of the younger. After all the World War II generation despaired 
of the antics of the baby boomers in the sixties. Now it seems to be 
quite fashionable for the baby boomers to start despairing of their 
juniors - not of course on the grounds that they are too radical but 
on the grounds that they are not radical enough.

  It is a good yarn and these sorts of discussions 
are culturally interesting but I think it overlooks another truth about 
Australian society.

  There are many faults in Australia which need to 
be fixed. But there is still so much good. When you see Australians 
working in Kosovo with Albanian refugees, when you see young Australians 
joining volunteer bushfire brigades, going on walkathons, 40 hour famines, 
manning soup kitchens, helping elderly neighbours, volunteering to serve 
abroad, running youth groups, fellowships and church organisations you 
see a side of young Australia that is caring and generous, committed 
to practical help, realistic and dedicated.

  And not all the bandsmen of the Salvation Army are 
middle aged.

  In the suburbs, in the cities, in the regions, the 
country areas, the young and the old, there are hundreds of thousands 
of Australians going about their work unsung, unrecognised, undemanding 
but irreplaceable.

  I haven’t given up on Young Australia. I see a 
quality and a commitment among some of our young people that is truly 
inspiring. 

  For those of you in the business community it’s 
been by and large a good year. We’ve come through the biggest financial 
crisis in our lifetimes. Australia is growing probably faster than any 
developed economy in the world. Our interest rates are low, our unemployment 
is falling and our economy is prosperous. 

  When you have a good year you put some grain in the 
store room to bank against the bad years. So for the Red Shield Appeal, 
not a budget deficit appeal, but a budget surplus appeal to put something 
aside for the future. For me it’s an honour to officially open this 
Appeal. And I do so in closing by reminding you of the publicity theme 
for the appeal: "Dig deep and thank God for the Salvos".
