 Further emergency assistance to combat drought in Southern Africa

 Australia will provide further urgent relief assistance worth about $2 million for people affected by drought in Southern Africa, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, John Kerin, announced today.

 The assistance will be provided through Australian non government organisations and brings to $14 million the total amount of relief assistance provided by Australia for drought stricken Southern Africa.

 "Conditions in Southern Africa are worsening and without concerted efforts, it will be difficult to meet even half the food aid needs until harvest next April," Mr Kerin said.

 "If the wet season in October fails, there is a real risk of widespread malnutrition and famine."

 Australian assistance will be provided as follows: BOTSWANA â¢ $280,000 through Australian Lutheran World Service for transportation of blankets, quilts, seeds and other relief items, plus construction of small warehouses and improvement of water supplies LESOTHO

 â¢ $50,000 through Australian Council of Churches for maize meal, peas, beans, vegetable oil, milk powder, fish powder, high protein bisuits and used clothing to vulnerable groups MALAWI
