 Chris Bowen MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 31 boats due to Abbott's obstinacy  Saturday, 12 May 2012 

 Joint media release with Chris Bowen MP - Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship and Jason Clare MP - Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for  Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel. 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for  Home Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said another asylum seeker boat was intercepted  today - a consequence of the Coalition's refusal to act in the national interest and  work with the government to implement offshore processing. 

 Mr Bowen said it was the 31st boat to arrive since Tony Abbott dismissed his own  policy and the government's offer to re-establish the offshore processing centre on  Nauru because he prefers to see more asylum seekers arrive by boat. 

 'Late last year, the government approached the opposition in good faith to sit down  and discuss what we could do to prevent people from risking their lives at sea,' Mr  Bowen said. 

 'We were willing to compromise, to negotiate, to put politics aside for the national  interest. But Tony Abbott said no. He said no to offshore processing, no to Nauru, no  to Malaysia, no to a review of temporary protection visas. 

 'Tony Abbott's negativity means there is no deterrent to stop people taking these  dangerous boat journeys and prevent more deaths at sea.' 

 Mr Clare said the time had come for the Coalition to allow for offshore processing to  proceed. 

 'Working together we can help stop people dying at sea. We can pass legislation to  introduce offshore processing,' Mr Clare said. 

 'If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must stop saying no and pass  our legislation to allow asylum seekers to be processed offshore in Malaysia and  Nauru.'
