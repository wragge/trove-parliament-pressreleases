 BUDGET MEDIA RELEASE 4

 IMPROVED TARGETING OF MIGRANT SETTLEMENT SERVICES

 Better planning and cooperation between government  departments and between government and community agencies  will result in more effective migrant settlement  services.

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, said today the direction  announced in the 1992-93 Budget will address both the  economic demands of Australia and essential migrant  needs, particularly among those of non-English speaking  background.

 "Settlement services need to be restructured to meet the  different needs of a new generation of migrants while  helping past generations to continue their contribution,  particularly those affected by the impact of industry  restructuring and economic recession," Mr Hand said.

 The features of the settlement programs include:

 - English training for jobseekers (through the  Department of Employment, Education and Training), to  reach the target of 48,000 jobseekers with ESL  requirements (see associated statement);

 - increased English language training by the  Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, focusing on arriving migrants so language skills  are acquired early (see associated statement)

 - changing migrant accommodation from old-style  hostels and government-owned flats to leased temporary  premises;

 - relocating three Adult Migrant Education Centres  (currently located in hostels) to those areas where  migrants are likely to settle ($1.27m a year in lease  costs over four years commencing 1993-94);

 - funding additional community grants to ensure that  some specific needs of established communities continue  to be met;

 - a new national computer system to improve access  and service quality with the Department's Translating and  Interpreting Service;

 - funding of a pilot telephone typewriter (TTY)  relay service in two centres to determine the needs  nationally of the speech and hearing impaired.

 Mr Hand said the programs would refocus settlement  efforts to deliver services to arriving migrants while  also addressing past needs that have not been met in the  past.

 Community grants

 The Budget provides an additional $1.77m for community-  based settlement services in 1992-93, and an additional  $lm in each of the following three years.

 This will allow for an additional 40 grants to continue  to provide services for youth, for people with  disabilities, for the ethnic aged, and for women, as well  as for health-related issues such as those for torture 

 and trauma victims.

 In line with the Government's access and equity  principles, the Department will continue to work with  other departments to ensure that they are responsive to  the needs of their non-English speaking clients and,  where appropriate, negotiate for the transfer of specific  purpose grants to these departments.

 On-arrival accommodation

 DILGEA will progressively withdraw from ownership of on-  arrival accommodation in all States except Queensland and  will instead lease self-contained accommodation.

 Out of the expected proceeds from the sale of existing  accommodation, including the Enterprise Hostel in  Melbourne and the Westbridge Centre in Sydney, $0.7m will  be used for community-based services for refugees and 

 other needy migrants settling in either the leased  accommodation or directly into the community.
