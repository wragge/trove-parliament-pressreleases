 The Hon. Scott Morrison MP  Minister for Immigration and Border Protection 

 

 Malaysia visit reboots cooperation on regional  deterrence  Friday, 25 October 2013 

 This week's visit to Malaysia by Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the  Hon Scott Morrison secured commitments for new and continued support on regional  deterrence to people smuggling. 

 Minister Morrison's visit was the first to Malaysia by an Abbott Government Cabinet  Minister and reaffirmed the countries' ongoing partnership in the fight against people  smugglers. 

 The visit included a meeting with Malaysian Minister of Home Affairs Dato Seri Dr.  Ahmad Zahid Bin Hamidi. 

 'With as much as 60 per cent of illegal maritime arrival traffic to Australia passing  through Malaysia it is a critical geographic link in the people smugglers' chain,' Mr  Morrison said. 

 'Disrupting arrivals at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, across the Thai Malay land  border or preventing the passage of illegal boat arrivals to Sumatra across the  Malacca Strait, is arguably more critical than anything we do once illegal boats have  left Indonesia. 

 'The Coalition has always understood this. That is why I was pleased to reboot our  co-operation with Malaysia, where I found nothing other than enthusiastic support for  our partnership,' Minister Morrison said. 

 Key outcomes of Minister Morrison's visit included: 

 ï· An Australian-Malaysian Joint Working Group on  Transnational Crime to be established, replacing the  Working Group on people smuggling and trafficking in  persons, and providing a vehicle for joint border security  operations and capability development. The first meeting  of the new working group will take place early next year  at the latest. 

 ï· A commitment on a series of joint Australia-Malaysia  operations involving the Department of Immigration and  Border Protection, Customs, and the Australian Federal  Police together with parallel agencies in Malaysia on air,  land and sea borders in the months ahead. Australian 

 immigration officials will work directly with the Ministry of  Home Affairs to assist, plan and prepare for these  operations.  ï· Malaysia's proposed Memorandum of Understanding on  transnational crime will be progressed by Minister  Morrison for implementation, in consultation with  colleagues including the Attorney-General.  ï· The Malaysian government has agreed to review visa on  arrival arrangements for Iraqi and Syrian nationals and  expressed support to graduate the existing biometric  data exchange pilot programme from its current infant  phase to an expanded operational phase. 

 'Malaysia has been a crucial partner in Australia's efforts to prevent people coming to  Australia illegally by boat and I thank the Malaysian Government and Dr Zahid in  particular, for his personal commitment on these matters and their continued  support,' Mr Morrison said. 

 'For Australia to have stronger borders, our region must have stronger borders,  focused on deterring those seeking to arrive and move through our region illegally.  That is where the Abbott Government is investing our efforts,' he said.

 Minister Zahid: [introduction] 

 Scott Morrison: Thank you Minister it is a pleasure to be here in Malaysia, the first  visit by a Cabinet Minister from the new Abbott Government to visit Malaysia and it is  a great privilege to be that Cabinet Minister and to extend the friendship and  continued cooperation of the new Government following on from the meeting of our  Prime Ministers recently on the sidelines in Bali of the APEC meeting. What we  would like to very much say to you Minister as we have just discussed, there are  many things for us to cooperate upon in dealing with not only the issues of people  smuggling where Malaysia has been a strong and committed partner but also  beyond that to the many challenges that are faced within the region on the issues of  transnational crime where I know you personally have taken a very strong position  and made very strong commitments. The Australian Government is very keen to  support you in those works and in those efforts. The Australian Government’s view is  that stronger regional borders create stronger borders for each country within the  region and that is a commitment we intend to fulfil as a government in working with  all the countries within the region, particularly within ASEAN with whom we, I think,  have a very special relationship and a relationship we want to see grow and flourish  over the next few years. So thank you for your encouragement, thank you for the  opportunity to discuss the things we certainly could work on today and we look  forward to that progress in the years ahead. 

 Zahid: Allow me to speak in my language to address a different audience. 

 [Informal Australian High Commission translation commences] What we have  discussed with Mr Scott Morrison are several aspects related to the presence of  illegal immigrants from several countries that use Malaysia as a country of transit  before they finally obtain permanent residence in Australia. 

 What we have done is we have a joint committee to identify a few aspects especially  to take action against those persons, and by identifying the countries that use  Malaysia because of the visa on arrival (VOA) for tourists that has been abused to  make Malaysia a transit. 

 As a result of this, we will check by using biometrics on those whom we suspect are  using Malaysia as a transit to Australia. We will exchange information on biometrics  to enable us to check on those who may be suspects, whether they are travelling by  air or by sea to Australia. 

 We will also check on the use of several entry points into Malaysia, such as the one  up north - the Malaysia-Thailand border. From there, we will conduct thorough  checks on them when they enter Malaysia as the third point before heading to  Australia. We will do this by taking actions on them based on the biometrics  information that is provided by Australia to us. If Australia is unable to provide us with  the biometrics information, we will take other actions such as asking those entering  Malaysia to show us that they have a return ticket so as to prove that they will be in  Malaysia for a limited time only. 

 I am also happy to announce that tourists from Iran previously were given a visa on  arrival for three months, but due to these reasons we will make amendments so  there are no more visa on arrival for Iranians. Instead, they will have to apply for a  visa to enter Malaysia and they will be given a duration of 14 days only to stay in this  country, because we are working closely with Australia to deter those from such  countries from entering Australia. 

 We are also committed to Australia’s request to look into those coming from Iraq and  Syria who may be using Malaysia as a country of transit before making their way to  Australia and to be accepted as permanent residents in Australia. 

 What we are doing is not to deny the rights of these citizens to come into Malaysia  as tourists, however we would like to maintain our strong relationship with countries  within the region, especially Australia, which is being used as the last destination by  these so-called tourists when they use Malaysia as a transit. 

 You may ask questions in English or Malay, if the Minister does not understand  Malay, the High Commissioner understands it very well. 

 Question: Dato’ you mentioned about the joint committee established with Australia.  Who are the committee members? 

 Zahid: The committee is made up of senior staff from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and the National Security  Council. 

 [Informal Australian High Commission translation ends] 

 Question: Under the new government, are there any changes to the immigration  policy where Malaysia is concerned? 

 Morrison: One of the things we are convinced of the need to continue is to  encourage students in particular to come and study in Australia and we are seeking  to improve the visa issuance timeframe particularly for those who are studying for  higher education degrees in Australia. So that is a very important process that we  will be working towards. 

 The key area of cooperation though has been the establishment in Australia of what  is called Operation Sovereign Borders which is a new whole of Government initiative  which is under the command of Lieutenant General Campbell who reports to me as  the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and what that does is bring  together not only immigration policy but Customs and Border Protection, the work of  our police, the work of our foreign Affairs and military even to work together to stop  the scourge of criminal people smuggling and many of the things the Minister and I  have discussed today have been about areas of cooperation between those  agencies. 

 So the new Abbott Government is absolutely resolved to stop the people smuggling  trade through this region to Australia and that is why I say by working with Malaysia  to create stronger borders for our region and other countries within the region we do  create stronger borders for Australia and stronger borders are good for trade, they  are good for commerce, they are good for the integrity of our immigration  programmes and that is why we are working hard to deliver those. 

 Question: The Minister (Ahmad Zahid) said both countries will exchange information  on biometrics. What will both countries do with such information? Will Malaysia stop  giving out visa on arrival to such countries? 

 Morrison: I should be clear on that - we are not seeking to take the Malaysian  information. Quite the reverse. What we are working together on is Malaysia has  quite a lot of information and we are seeking to match the information we have with  what Malaysia has and that process is done here. So there is no process that  involves the Australian Government taking information from Malaysia. This is very  much a cooperative project working together where it occurs here in Malaysia. So we  appreciate that cooperation very, very much, as we appreciate the cooperation on  the disruption activity. The Malaysian Government and particularly the police and  others have had, and the maritime enforcement agency, have been very successful  in disrupting people smugglers bringing people through Malaysia to take them to  Indonesia and then on to Australia and the breaking up of that pattern of people  moving through Malaysia is what we are very focused on achieving and that is where  we are getting great cooperation and support.
