 PORT HEDLAND DEMONSTRATION WILL NOT INFLUENCE REFUGEE^ PROCESS

 Todayâ€™s rooftop protest at the Port Hedland Immigration Reception  and Processing Centre will not influence the proper processing  of refugee claims, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus, said today.

 Senator Bolkus said that applications for refugee status by the  nine Chinese boat people involved in the demonstration had been  assessed both at the primary level by the Department of 

 Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, and by the independent Refugee  Review Tribunal.

 "The RRT has upheld the initial decision to refuse refugee 

 status, finding that the applicants do not meet the United 

 Nations' Convention definition of a '  refugee'  as a person unable  to return to their country of origin because of a well-founded  fear of persecution," he said.

 "There are avenues of appeal available to asylum seekers who have  been rejected at primary and-review stages.

 "I will not be intimidated by actions such as today's 

 demonstration into interfering with the proper processes the  Government has in place."
