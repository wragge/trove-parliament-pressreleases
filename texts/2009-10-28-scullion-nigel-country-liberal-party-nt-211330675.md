 Labor seeks to deflect attention from unauthorised arrivals   28-October-2009 

 Country Liberals Senator Nigel Scullion has accused the Federal Government of trying to deflect attention from  the growing number of unauthorised boat arrivals by quibbling over the language that should be used to refer to  asylum seekers. 

 “Minister for Immigration Chris Evans thought it was more important to lecture the Senate about using  ‘deliberately provocative language’, instead of explaining what the Government plans to do about its failed  immigration policy,” Senator Scullion said. 

 “This was a deliberate attempt to deflect attention from the fact we have now had more than 17 unauthorised  boats arrive in the last eight weeks alone. 

 “What is worse is that when the Prime Minister promised to, ‘take a hard line approach in dealing with the  challenge of illegal immigration,’ he used precisely the same language for which Senator Evans attacked  Coalition senators. 

 “The fact is that as Minister for Immigration, Senator Evans destroyed Coalition measures that disrupted people  smugglers and protected the integrity of our humanitarian migration program. 

 “It is time for Senator Evans to heed the warnings from the Australian Federal Police, the comments from asylum  seekers, and the statements from people smugglers, and admit that it is Federal Labor policy that has caused the  influx. 

 “We heard yesterday that Australia is set to receive a ‘population explosion’. Labor must regain control of our  borders to ensure we can provide equitable access for refugees.”
