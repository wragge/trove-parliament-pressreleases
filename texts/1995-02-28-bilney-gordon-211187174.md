 AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE FOR REFUGEES ON THAI-BURMA BORDER

 Australia will provide grants totalling $500,000 in emergency relief for agencies supporting  the increasing numbers o f refugees moving across the Thai-Burma border into Thailand, the  Minister for Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney, said today.

 "Relief agencies are reporting that up to 15,000 Karens have recently crossed into Thailand's  Kanchanaburi province at BonPi Pass," Mr Bilney said. "This brings the total number of  refugees now living in the camps to around 80,000 persons."

 "The most pressing need is for food supplies but medical supplies, blankets and mosquito nets  are also being provided."

 Australia's grants will be provided to the two key organisations running relief activities in the  camps.

 A grant of $350,000 will be made to the National Council of Churches in Australia to  support the relief programs of the Burma Border Consortium (BBC). The BBC is a group  of eight Thai and international non-government agencies which is coordinating emergency  supplies for the camps. The funds will be used to purchase urgent food supplies, mosquito nets 

 and blankets.

 A second grant of $150,000 will made to Austcare to support medical programs provided by  Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF). These focus mainly on the control of malaria, but also  target immunisation, maternal and child health, nutrition, sanitation and water supply.

 Today's announcement is the latest in a series of annual grants for relief efforts in the region.  Last year the Australian Government provided $300,000 for the work of BBC and MSF.
