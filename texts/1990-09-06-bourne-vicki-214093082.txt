 NEWS RELEASE

 CATASTROPHE IMMINENT-. 

 GULF REFUGEES NEED AID NOW

 As conditions rapidly deteriorate in the camps of refugees  fleeing Iraq far more urgent international aid is needed to  prevent a crisis of unprecedented proportions said Australian  Democrat spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, Senator Vicki 

 Bourne.

 Senator Bourne called on the Australian Government to  immediately Increase the aid promised to a more realistic  amount.

 "When you consider the massive cost, and imprudence, of  sending the frigates to the Gulf, the $500,000 promised is a  drop in the ocean", said Senator Bourne,

 "We have a moral and international responsibility to help the  hundreds of thousands of innocent victims of the Gulf Crisis",  said Senator Bourne, "especially when you remember that our  frigates are contributing directly to the threat which these  people are so desperately escaping".

 Australian Democrats remain convinced that the only viable  solution to this crisis is for all action against the  outrageous aggression of Iraq to be controlled by the united  Nations,

 "Too many people have already perished since this crisis  began. We must do all in our power to prevent the loss of  further innocent lives", said Senator Bourne.
