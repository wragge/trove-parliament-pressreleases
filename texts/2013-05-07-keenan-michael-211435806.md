 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW May 07, 2013

 Subjects: Record border failures force Labor to dump families and children in community, illegal boat arrival in  Geraldton

 E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………………………………………………………

 MORRISON:

 Well I’m joined by Michael Keenan today.  We’re in Melbourne to have a briefing on the Geraldton incident of a number of weeks ago and I’ll ask Michael to make a few comments about that and other border related matters in a minute or so.  But first of all I wanted to provide a response to the government’s announcement today that they will be providing bridging  visas for families who have arrived on boats and in particular they will be taking families and children back into detention centres like Curtin and Wickham Point and places such as these for periods of on average the Minister says of around 120 days.  This week we saw more than 40,000 people, the 40,000th person turn up on an illegal boat in Australia, the  more  than  20,000th  person  turn  up  this  financial  year  alone.   These  record  border  failures  are  the  reason  why  the government has had to make the decision that it has today.  This financial year more than 3,000 children have come on boats  risking  their  lives  this  year.  Last  year  it  was  just  under  2,000.   The  year  before  that  it  was  around  1,000.   The escalation of the number of children coming on boats under this government’s border failures is unprecedented.  They’ve  set the record for the number of children on boats.  We know at the end of February there were around 2,000 children in the  system,  more  than  1,000  of  those  were  actually  in  more  formal  detention  facilities  like  the  ones  the  Minister  has announced today. Now what is striking about that is that in 2010 it was Minister Bowen who said he was going to take all the children out of those facilities and today, as in February, there  were more  children in  those facilities then  than they were  when  Minister  Bowen  made  that  promise  which  has  now  clearly  been  overwhelmed  by  this  government’s  border  protection failures.

 The concerns I have about these arrangements are many. What is clear to me is Labor’s bridging visa policy has already  acted as an incentive for people to get on boats as we saw the incredible increase in arrivals that followed the decision of the government back in 2011.  But what we have also seen is their bridging visa policy is without standards, is without safeguards, is without safeguards where we have had individuals being found in squalid conditions all around the country.  Labor’s bridging visa policy is an all care no responsibility dumping policy of asylum seekers into the community and now that they don’t have the beds available in community detention, they’re now going to do that with women and children and  families as well.  So not just take them into formal detention but when they’re finished with that they will just be dumped  into the community.  Now that will put them potentially at more risk arguably in the community than they arguably are in detention facilities.  The other part of this is migrant resource centres, charitable organisations will be called upon to make up the gap for the shortage of support and services that the government have provided in these cases.  These resources are already overstretched and they’re already overstrained and they will be placed under even more pressure as a result of the government’s decision today to put families and children in particular into this situation.  The last point I’ll make is  this; the government says they’re doing this because they think it will cost less. When the government made its decision to introduce  bridging  visas  for  single  adult  males,  the  total  budget  for  asylum  seeker  management  in  this  country  for  the Department of Immigration was $1.2 billion.  The following year, this year, after that policy was introduced; it’s $2.5 billion.   What Labor doesn’t understand is if you want to stop the cost you have to stop the boats.  And if you don’t have policies  that achieve that then these are the sorts of diabolical outcomes that result from Labor’s border protection  failures and  Australia simply cannot afford three more years of Labor’s border failures.  I’ll ask Michael to make some comments.

 KEENAN:

 Thanks Scott and as Scott said I’m here for a briefing with himself and the Leader of the Opposition about the boat that arrived  in  Geraldton  harbour.   Now  I  had  the  opportunity  two  weeks  ago  to  visit  Geraldton  with  the  Leader  of  the Opposition so we do know a little about what happened and we’ve been seeking a further briefing from the government  before that and we’ve been continuing to seek it to get the detail today.  Whilst we’re after the nuts and bolts today, we do  know  the reason  this is happening; that a  boat could  sail  undetected into  Geraldton Harbour, that  boats are  essentially now just bumping into Cocos Island, that boats are coming very close to Darwin and the mainland of the north west of West  Australia  and  that  is  because  we  are  faced  at  the  moment  with  an  unprecedented  rate  of  illegal  boat  arrivals courtesy of Labor’s failed border protection policies.  So far this financial year we’ve had over 20,000 people arrive here  illegally.  That means within Labor’s enhanced Refugee and Humanitarian Program every single place is going to be taken up by somebody who came illegally by boat.  But what I think is lost sometimes just by the sheer scale of what’s going on 

 is  how  this  is  deteriorating   significantly  since  April  which  was  the  worst  month  on  record  for  illegal  boat  arrivals,  over 3,300 people. In the first week of May we’ve had over 1,000 people arrive illegally on boats so this problem has been very

 significant, this problem has been very bad for Australia but the point now is it is continuing to get worse week by week, month by month  and  the consequences for that are  borne by hardworking  men and women  in Customs, the Australian Federal Police, in particular border protection command who are forced to work on a scale that’s been unprecedented in  their  history  and  of  course  the  consequences  for  that  are  taking  their  toll  on  the  personnel  within  border  protection command  but  also  on  the  fleet  of  boats  they  use  which  is  literally  cracking  up  under  the  pressure  of  the  enhanced operational tempo that results from having to deal with this flood of illegal boats.  So we’re looking forward to getting the  details about how a boat managed to sail into Geraldton Harbour today, about how that boat was apparently detected by people drinking coffee at the Dome Cafe but we all know the macro reason why this is happening and that is because Labor have completely lost control over our borders and they have no plans to change their policies to alter it.

 MORRISON:

 Any questions?

 QUESTION:

 Under  the  current  arrangement  proposed  by  Labor,  people  being  released  into  the  community  on  these  bridging  visas, they’re not allowed to work.  Would that be something you would allow?

 MORRISON:

 No the Coalition’s policy is all those who have received bridging visas from the Labor government if we’re elected later this  year, they won’t receive work rights.  But they will be required to engage in mutual obligation programs, work for the dole and things of that nature.  In addition, we would have the appropriate guidelines and protocols that I’ve discussed before  that would apply to those who are on bridging visas, that’s our policy.  We warned the government when they introduced their bridging visa policy in November 2011 that the work rights they attached would act as an incentive.  Both the bridging visas  combined  with  that  certainly  did  that  and  it  continues  in  terms  of  the  policies  of  this  government  to  lead  to  this incredible rate of arrivals.  As I said, 3,000 children plus this year on boats, that is unprecedented and that is a disgrace. 

 QUESTION:

 Do you have access yourself - do you get access to these detention centres to have a look and talk to some of the people there?

 MORRISON:

 Michael and I have been to many if not most  -

 QUESTION:

 And what have the people told you, why are they there? 

 MORRISON:

 Well it’s for the government to actually tell you why they keep some in there - sorry?

 QUESTION: Why have they got on a boat to come here?

 MORRISON:

 Well the reasons are mixed and varied and that’s what’s determined through the interview process.  There are 10.4 million refugees in the world today and they can all tell you their stories.  At the end of the day the Australian government has to make a sovereign decision about how people are taken into our refugee and humanitarian program.  Now the Coalition does  not  support  that  decision  being  made  by  people  smugglers  and  people  risking  their  lives  on  boats.   We  are  100 percent opposed to that.

 QUESTION:

 You say these people are being dumped into communities.  Those that are genuine refugees, what do you plan on doing with them?

 MORRISON:

 Those who are found to be refugees at the end of their processing under a Coalition government would be eligible for a temporary protection visa.  A temporary protection visa, no permanent visa, no citizenship but a temporary protection visa.

 QUESTION:

 Would they be allowed to work?

 MORRISON:

 On a temporary protection visa at the end of their processing when they are found to be a refugee yes but not before.

 QUESTION:

 The Government also claimed today that the Coalition sorry the Opposition has upset regional neighbours, do you have a response to that?

 MORRISON:

 I’d like you to explain how we did that?

 QUESTION:

 They said by your approach to handling this issue you’ve upset a few like Indonesia and -

 MORRISON:

 The government has more excuses than you can poke a stick at for why they do nothing on our borders.  The Coalition’s  policies are not theories, they’re facts.  They are history.  They are things that have been implemented and implemented successfully and maintaining excellent relationships with our regional partners.  We’re committed to having a constructive  partnership with our region and putting in place a deterrence framework that assists those countries as much as it assists Australia and the way you go about that is not the megaphone diplomacy of this government.  It doesn’t go by abolishing  the live cattle trade and denying Indonesia a food source, with a slap in the face, or announcing East Timor processing centres  without  talking  to  the  Joint  Chair  of  the  Bali  Process.   That’s  how  this  government  does  business.   A  Coalition   government  will  work  constructively  with  Indonesia  and  the  other  countries  in  the  region  to  put  deterrence  back  in  the system as opposed to what this government has pursued.

 QUESTION:

 Would you follow the recommendations of the Houston Panel Report?  

 MORRISON: Well look we have our policies that we believe in. The vast majority of those Houston measures have been implemented and the one measure that the government continually crows about, the Malaysian people swap, they haven’t implemented  the Houston Panel’s recommendations on that.  That policy still  stands foul of the Houston Panel Recommendations, it does not have the protections in place that the Houston Panel recommended and the government knows they’ll never be  able to achieve them.  Minister Bowen told me himself well before the Houston Panel the Malaysian government would never agree to legally binding protections or to waive the 800 cap.  The 800 cap would see Malaysia exhausted in the first week of May.  Thank you.

 Ends
