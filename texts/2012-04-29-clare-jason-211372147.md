 ANOTHER BOAT BUT TONY ABBOTT STILL SAYS NO   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said the latest asylum seeker boat arrival was more proof of the  consequences of the Coalition’s failure to act in the national interest on border protection.   

 This is the 24th boat since Tony Abbott said no to offshore processing.   

 “Mr Abbott used a speech this week to again confirm that he is putting his own political  interests ahead of the national interest by standing in the way of offshore processing,” Mr  Bowen said.   

 “If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he should stop the cheap and simple  quotes and work with the Government to implement offshore processing instead of blocking  it.”   

 Mr Clare said Mr Abbott agreed that offshore processing was the most effective way to stop  people making a dangerous journey but was standing in the way for his own political  purposes.    

 “It’s time for Tony Abbott to stop saying no and pass our legislation to allow offshore  processing in Malaysia and Nauru,” Mr Clare said.
