 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  HON ALEXANDER DOWNER, MP   

 

 TRANSCRIPTION: PROOF COPY E & OE   

 

 DATE: November 16 2003  TITLE:   Doorstop  -  Adelaide  

 

 Downer: First of all I think what has been extremely important from the point of view of  the Australian public’s understanding of where the Labor Party is going, has been the two  interviews this morning with Kevin Rudd and with Carmen Lawrence.  On the 20th of March  this year, Mr Crean said to the National Press Club, that Australia should withdraw its troops  from Iraq.  Mr Rudd is now saying that Australia should be increasing the number of troops  we have in Iraq.  This is an extraordinary thing for the Labor Party - where its leader thinks  that we should have no troops in Iraq, the Opposition Spokesman on Foreign Affairs, who has  just been to Iraq, thinks we should be sending extra troops there to provide training, and for  troops also to provide those people with protection.  Which is a complete backflip from  Labor’s earlier position.  When the war started, Labor opposed sending any troops to Iraq.   That was not a position we agreed with, but that was a respectable position.  Now Mr Rudd  says that Iraq is still a war zone, and that we should be sending more troops.  I have to say I  don’t think the public will understand what the Labor Party stands for, or what the Labor  Party is talking about.  The second thing I would say is that Dr Lawrence, having been now  elected the President of the Australian Labor Party, makes it perfectly clear that she, from the  position of President of the Party - not a backbencher anymore, but President of the Party, has  decided that she’ll campaign to dismantle the whole of our border protection policy.  And  basically at the end of the day, the Labor Party isn’t committed to a strong border protection  policy, and Dr Lawrence is trying to water down what’s left of the Labor Party policy.  So  you have a Labor Party totally confused over the issue of Iraq, contradicting itself.  And you  have a Labor Party on border protection, where it basically wants to walk away from a policy  that has proved to be extraordinarily effective.  Tough - true - but extraordinarily effective  over the last two years, with just two boats reaching Australian shores in that period of time.  I  think this is a Labor Party that’s lost all credibility.  An Opposition that has to restructure  itself somehow, think through its positions and try to develop proper policies which have  some coherence to the rather mish-mash of nonsense we’re getting at the moment.   

 Journalist: Wasn’t Kevin Rudd in fact suggesting police go to Iraq to train Iraqis?   

 Downer: Police and military trainers - he’s suggesting both.  He’s suggesting that there  be an increase in Australia’s military presence, of course including police.   

 Journalist:  …(inaudible)…you’re opposed to Labor’s idea?   

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 1

 

 Downer: It’s not Labor’s idea.  It’s not Labor’s idea.  Labor’s idea is that we should  withdraw all of our troops from Iraq.  That’s been the Labor Party position since the 20th of  March.  Now the Labor Party has decided that - actually, not only should we reverse our  policy on withdrawing troops, we should actually increase our presence there in Iraq.  Now I  think the balance that we have at the moment is good.  We have a commitment there in Iraq.   It’s a sensible commitment and if we change the mix of that commitment at some time in the  future, we’ll do that if that is, we believe, in the best interests of the contribution we can  make.  But what we do, is of course coherent and consistent.  What the Labor Party is doing is  I think being extraordinarily opportunistic with an important issue of war and peace here.   And I don’t think that does this country credit, that the main opposition party is so totally  confused and so utterly opportunistic.   

 Journalist: He also suggested that the Prime Minister goes to Iraq and see things for  himself.  Would you support that?   

 Downer: Mr Rudd no doubt if the Prime Minister did go to Iraq, would complain about  all the additional security that would have to be devoted to protecting Mr Howard, and would  put out press releases about the cost of Mr Howard making an overseas trip.  The Labor Party  on the one hand says its outrageous that the Prime Minister goes overseas and spends so much  money.  But on the other hand we have Mr Rudd calling for the Prime Minister to make yet  another overseas trip.  Now, again it’s a typical example of the puerile opportunism that’s  nowadays coming out of the Crean-led Australian Labor Party.  And it’s not good enough for  the main opposition party in Australia.   

 Journalist: How do you assess the situation in Iraq at the moment, (inaudible)?   

 Downer: I think the situation is difficult in Baghdad and in what’s sometimes called the  Sunni Triangle.  And I regret very much the news today of the downing of a further  helicopter, which in coming down apparently ran into another helicopter.  But, I make this  point about the situation in Iraq - the Americans and those that are contributing in Iraq,  including us, have got to see it through, and make sure in the best interests of the Iraqi people  and broader global security, that the vast majority of Iraqis are able to live in a peaceful and  democratic country.  They’ve put up with a great deal over the last three decades.  Everything  from the United Nations sanctions to the complete brutality of Saddam Hussein and his  passion for war, having declared war on two of his neighbours, and some two million people  have been killed in wars and internal conflict as a result of Saddam Hussein’s activities.  So  they’re looking for a peaceful outcome.  And we’ve got to stay the course rather than giving  in to Saddam Hussein loyalists, Baathist loyalists and some of their fellow travellers.  I was in  the Netherlands two days ago and I met with the Dutch Prime Minister there.  And the  Netherlands has about 1,100 troops in Iraq.  And they’re doing a six-monthly review and they  are determined to keep their troops there.  The Dutch are absolutely determined to see this  through.  And I emphasised that I hoped the Prime Minister would remain strong in his  commitment to the Iraqi people, and the Dutch Prime Minister was very strong in that  commitment.  That’s the sort of admirable strength that we look for from the international  community.   

 Journalist: So is progress being made in the security situation do you think?   

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 2

 

 Downer: It is in some parts of the country.  It depends where you go.  Overall, in some  parts of the country the situation is of course very much improved.  In the Baghdad - Sunni  Triangle area around Baghdad, and Baghdad itself, the situation is still very difficult, there’s  no question of that.   

 Journalist: ..withdrawal of the Coalition (inaudible)  Administration,   

 Downer: Coalition Provisional Administration.   

 Journalist: What’s the situation there?  What’s the latest there?   

 Downer: I hope that that can be withdrawn as soon as possible, but not so soon as to  leave Iraq in a state of anarchy.  It can be withdrawn when an Iraqi provisional government is  established.  That might be possible to do that over the course of next year.  And I would hope  very much that would be possible through 2004.  There are some suggestions it might be  possible to do that by the middle of 2004, but we need to wait and see, it’s still a work in  progress.  But it depends a little bit on the Iraqis themselves and how quickly they themselves  want to move.  But I think that’s a reasonable aspiration.   

 Journalist:  How  mindful are you of, obviously the situation in the last Gulf War where it  was (inaudible) in some quarters that the Iraqi people were in a way left in the lurch by the  withdrawal.  Is that a concern?   

 Downer: Yes.  That’s a very good question.  I think both the Kurds in the north and  some of the Shia in the south, felt - and I’m not saying this is necessarily my view - but they  felt that they were very much let down by the Coalition after the first Gulf War.  The Iraqi  people overwhelmingly support the toppling of Saddam Hussein.  There is very little support  for the insurgency that’s taking place there, largely dominated by Baathist elements, by  Saddam Hussein loyalists, but with some foreign terrorists coming in to supplement the  efforts.  The Iraqi people are overwhelmingly opposed to that, and overwhelmingly welcome  the change in their circumstances.  So, we owe it to the Iraqis to make sure that we don’t  suddenly up stumps and walk away.   

 Journalist: What’s the latest on those Kurdish boat people who were returned back, and it  now appears that the Indonesians are say that they didn’t want them back?  Is it just a  stalemate?   

 Downer: No it’s not.  The people themselves, as I understand it, are in the custody of the  Indonesian immigration authorities and are being spoken to by the International Organisation  of Migration and UNHCR officials - certainly by the International Organisation of Migration,  and I think UNHCR officials.  So their situation is being processed, as one would hope it  would be.  I think the co-operation we’ve had with Indonesia on this issue has been excellent.   We informed the Indonesians of what we were proposing to do.  They made sure that police  were in position to care for the people when they arrived back at Yamdena Island.  We  worked with the Indonesians to get the International Organisation of Migration down to  Yamdena Island so they could also be involved in the process.  And the Indonesians have  done a good job so far.  We’re going to have to wait and see in the end what happens to them.   But we’ve been happy with the way the Indonesians have handled this, and it has been an 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 3

 

 example of good co-operation.  This, to put it into some context, this is a further example of  the constructive role Indonesia has been playing.  They have intercepted around 4,000,  slightly under 4,000 possible illegal immigrants who would have otherwise come to Australia  in the last two and a half or three years.  So, I think the Indonesians are doing a good job.  But  Indonesia’s a very big country and people smugglers are still active there.  And the  Indonesians and us are absolutely determined to stop the people smugglers.  I know Dr  Lawrence’s policy is to put out the welcome mat for the people smugglers, to say - look, you  can get people to Australia if Labor becomes the government because they’re not tough on  border security.  I think the Indonesians and us have done a very good job, particularly over  the last two years, where we’ve only had, as you know, two boats which have actually arrived  onto the Australian coastline.   

 Journalist: Why can’t the people smugglers be brought here and (inaudible)?   

 Downer: They’re not within our jurisdiction.  They’re within Indonesian jurisdiction.   The Indonesian Parliament, the Indonesian Government has drafted legislation to create the  offence of people smuggling (inaudible) hasn’t passed through the Parliament yet to the best  of my knowledge, so that’s obviously a restriction.  But the Indonesians have been doing their  best.  And look, we would have had large numbers of illegal migrants coming courtesy of  people smuggling over the last few years if it hadn’t been for two things - one, the very  strong measures we’ve taken.  So we send out a message to people smugglers that Australia’s  closed for business.  And some of them have been going around saying that.  But secondly the  Indonesians have been doing a very good job, as the fact that they’ve managed to deal with  around slightly under 4,000 people demonstrated.   

 Journalist: Do you feel that you misled the Australian public over concerns that these  Kurds didn’t apply for refugee …?   

 Downer: I absolutely misled no-one.  I think this is a very good example of the  transparent processes of government.  We passed on information as it became available to us.   I passed on information that became available to me on the Saturday or Sunday, when I had  the doorstop, and when I saw the Turks claiming otherwise I asked for that to be investigated.   When we got further information Amanda Vanstone (I was overseas at the time) passed that  on.  Exactly what the government should do.  And I think it is preposterous and deeply  dishonest for people to suggest that somehow there was any attempt by the government to  mislead anybody.  There has been no attempt to mislead anybody over this boat.  You see,  this again comes back to the Labor Party - the party that basically wants to pull down the  barriers for the stopping of people smuggling.  It’s the party that’s going around verballing  people and accusing people of being dishonest, when people have been perfectly transparent  and perfectly honest.  I think that’s a very very poor opposition we have at the moment, led by  an extremely weak and directionless man.   

 Journalist:  Inaudible.  

 

 Downer: Sounds extremely like a political stunt to me.  I would say of the Labor Party -  look get off the stunts.  Get off the stunts where you are sending messages the whole time out  to the people smugglers - oh no, the government is too tough on people smuggling.  That’s  the undercurrent of all of these measures.  The Northern Territory Attorney-General, a Labor

 member of the Northern Territory Assembly, is just part of a broader Labor Party gang, which  is (inaudible) sending a message to people smugglers that if Labor becomes the national  government in Australia, then Australia will be open for business.  I don’t care whether our  policy is tough, or it’s controversial.  I’ll tell you what our policy is - it’s effective.  And we  have the strength to implement an effective policy.  We’ll put up with the criticisms of the  political left in Australia, particularly the Labor Party.  We’ll put up with their opportunistic  comments, their sniping, their dishonest allegations.  We’ll put up with all of that because our  policy works.  It’s been extraordinarily effective.  And I think rightly is well supported by the  Australian people, because the Australian people welcome migrants.  The Australian people  are happy for us to have refugees, but the Australian people don’t want immigration chaos.   And I’ve told you already I’ve been in the Netherlands, and they have just tightened up their  policies in order to deal with the issue of illegal migration.  And that’s what is happening all  over Europe.  But what is happening in Australia is that our opposition and its fellow  travellers are out there saying we should weaken the policy.  So Europe is tightening up and  Australia has an opposition that wants to weaken the policy.  What we want as a government  is to have the strength to pursue effective policies and that’s what we’ve done.   

 Journalist: The Baktiari children have this morning made an emotional plea to be reunited  with their mother.  What’s the Government’s position?   

 Downer:  I haven’t seen that.  I couldn’t comment.  You would have to take that up with  Amanda Vanstone.  I just don’t know about that - it doesn’t fall within my portfolio.   

 Journalist: On a separate issue, a journalist from Melbourne arrived in LA for an  interview and had an (inaudible) visa and was interrogated and strip searched (inaudible)?   What’s your reaction?   

 Downer: I would have to know more about it, sorry.  I would have to know more about  the situation.  It’s not common, but there are occasions when people don’t get in to the United  States.  We have a travel advisory which people should read, and they should always read our  travel advisories.  And the travel advisories do explain what the requirements are for entering  the United States.  They’ve obviously, particularly sine 9-11, toughened up very much their  entry requirements.  I couldn’t comment because I don’t the circumstances of this particular 

 case.   

 Journalist: Are you concerned by that sort of treatment?   

 Downer: I don’t know enough about it to be able to express a view, but I would have to  know more about the situation.
