  Australia to provide $5.8 million to assist conflict victims in Africa 

  I am pleased to announce the Australian Government will provide $5.8 million towards the  international relief operation in Sudan and to assist refugees in Kenya. 

  Through our international aid agency AusAID, we will provide $3 million through the World  Food Programme (WFP) for food relief to Darfur in Sudan. 

  The worsening violence in Darfur has forced many to flee to displaced persons camps. Our  funding will help wF7J to continue feeding nearly three million people. 

  An additional $2.8 million will be provided through WFP to help feed 250,000 Sudanese and  Somali refugees living in Kenyan refugee camps. 

  Families are relying on food aid to survive as the world’s largest ongoing relief operation  continues in Sudan. 

  The additional support for WFP’s operation in Darfur will bring Australia’s assistance to  Sudan since May 2004 to $55.6 million. 

  Australia will continue to closely monitor the situation in Sudan.
