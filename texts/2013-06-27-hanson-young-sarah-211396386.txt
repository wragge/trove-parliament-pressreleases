 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Thursday, 27th June 2013   

 Greens introduce bill to care for  unaccompanied refugee children   

 The Greens will introduce a bill into the Senate today that would see guardianship of  unaccompanied refugee children at last taken from the Immigration Minister, who is responsible  for their harmful detention in Australia and offshore, and given to a new independent body.   

 “It’s terrible that this government is dumping unaccompanied children in detention and leaving  them there without an adequate guardian,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator  Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Holding a dual role as these children’s guardian and jailer, it is clear that the Immigration  Minister is so conflicted that he can’t be trusted with the role of carer.   

 “The Minister currently has guardianship over 670 unaccompanied children.   

 “We need to decide, as a nation, whether we want to care for vulnerable children who have no  one to look after them or to punish them and lock them in detention.   

 “This bill will remain on the notice paper until after the upcoming election and I call on the next  government to work with the Greens in the Senate to pass this essential legislation.   

 “The approach outlined in this bill is backed by children’s experts including the Australian  Human Rights Commission, the United Nations and was recommended by a Senate inquiry just  last year.”   

 The Greens’ bill would establish an independent office of Guardian for Unaccompanied Children,  which would; 

 - Advocate for the best interests of unaccompanied minors, including advocating against  their detention and ensuring appropriate care, education and support  - Consult with other agencies and services   - Report directly to Parliament  - Monitor and review laws, policies and practices which impact on unaccompanied 

 minors
