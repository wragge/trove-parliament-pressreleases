 Australian Assistance for East Timorese Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons in Indonesia

 I am pleased to announce Australia will contribute to two international appeals to assist with internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Indonesia and refugees from East Timor.

 Australia is deeply concerned about the 1.3 million people whose lives have been severely affected by communal conflict in parts of Indonesia. Many of these conflicts are the result of uneven economic development and require complex solutions in dealing with the consequences of local unrest. The ability of the Indonesian Government to support large numbers of internally displaced persons is severely limited by tight budgetary constraints.

 The package I am announcing today will provide $8.5 million through various UN Agencies and non-government organizations to help vulnerable groups among internally displaced peoples, with particular emphasis on assistance for women and children. The assistance package will include food aid, support for recovery activities in Maluku, education assistance for children of internally displaced persons, and school-based community reconciliation activities.

 Australia will also contribute $6.6 million to assist the Indonesian Government and the United Nations to find lasting solutions for up to 80,000 East Timorese still living in refugee camps in West Timor. Activities will include an ongoing information campaign to inform East Timorese refugees on conditions in East Timor, funding to help offset lost pension entitlements of former Indonesian Government employees willing to return, and an enhanced repatriation package including transport and food aid on return.
