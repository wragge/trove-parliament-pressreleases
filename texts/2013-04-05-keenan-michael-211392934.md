 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling PEOPLE SMUGGLERS’ TWICE DAILY BOAT  SERVICE April 05, 2013

 The arrival of two more illegal boats, with a total of over 100 people on board, comes as people smugglers run a twice  daily service to Australia under Julia Gillard’s failed policies, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott  Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “Julia Gillard’s chaotic border policies have reached new lows with people smugglers now running a twice daily service  with an average of more than 100 people arriving every day this month,” Mr Morrison said.

 “Last month’s record of over 2,500 people arriving illegally by boat already looks under threat and these latest arrivals will  put even more pressure on the Budget.

 “The Budget is still more than five weeks away and at the current rate of arrivals, an extra 3,500 people could arrive by  illegal boat, meaning more blow outs on our borders that already stand at $6.6 billion.

 “The current Budget for 2012/13 assumed just 12,000 arrivals. As of today more than 16,000 and that number could  exceed 20,000 by the end of June,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “The latest two interceptions are the 70th and 71st boats to be successfully smuggled across our borders  this year - that’s more boat arrivals already this year than in the whole of 2011.

 “Five days into the month of April and there have already been 8 boats and a total of 472 passengers - already more than  the monthly total of arrivals that Labor has budgeted for. 

 “The boats are continuing to arrive amidst revelations that over 13,000 asylum seekers are still waiting to undergo ASIO  security checks, with many having already been released into the community due to the huge pressure placed on the  detention network. 

 “Labor’s failure to stop this crisis of their own making has left us with an overflowing detention network, a $6 billion dollar  budget blow-out and an overstretched and under resourced Border Protection Command.

 “We need a return to a Coalition Government that will put an end to the people smuggling trade and restore the Australian  people’s faith in our immigration system,” Mr Keenan said.
