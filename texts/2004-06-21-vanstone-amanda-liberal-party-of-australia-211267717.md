 Australia's Proud Contribution to World Refugees

 VPS 86/2004

 Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today that World Refugee Day provided an ideal opportunity to  reiterate Australia's efforts in resettling more than 620,000 refugees and displaced people since World War Two. 

 'Australia has a long and proud history of resettling people who have genuine fear of persecution or discrimination in their  homeland,' Senator Vanstone said.

 'Our refugee program is one of the three largest dedicated resettlement programs in the world and in the past 10 years alone  Australia has resettled more than 100,000 people under this program.

 'Following World War 2, in the period 1947 to 1954, Australia resettled 170,000 displaced people mainly from Eastern  Europe. Resettlement of people fleeing from this area continued until the mid 1970s.

 'During the 70s, the focus of resettlement activity was broadened to include Chileans following the overthrow of the Allende  government in 1973 and people from the countries of Indo-China after 1975.

 'The 1990s saw the global focus move from South East Asia to Europe and the Middle East. The focus of our program is  currently Africa.

 'The focus of the Humanitarian Program will continue to change to meet changing international circumstances. However,  regardless of the international situation, Australia will continue to extend its welcome to those most in need. 

 'Earlier this year I announced an increase in Australia's Humanitarian Program. 

 'The Humanitarian Program has been set at 12 000 new places per annum for the past seven years. From 2004-05 this figure  will increase to 13 000 places and will include a 50 percent increase in the refugee category up from 4000 to 6000 places.

 'These places target those most in need of resettlement, people who are unable to return to their home country in conditions of  safety and dignity.

 'Australians should be proud of the fact that we have helped so many people, from so many places, rebuild their lives and find  a positive future for themselves and their families in Australia.

 'These people have also made an important contribution to the growth of multiculturalism and Australia's diversity in a free  land.'
