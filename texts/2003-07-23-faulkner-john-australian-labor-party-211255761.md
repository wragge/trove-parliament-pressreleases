 Senator John Faulkner  

 Shadow Special Minister of State and Home Affairs  Address to the Australian Fabian Society   Trades Hall, Carlton South, Victoria  23 July 2003 

 

 “A Certain Maritime Incident” - the aftermath   

 Introduction   

 In February 2002 the Labor Party, with the agreement of the minor parties in  the Senate, established a Senate Select Committee to examine fully the  children overboard incident. We wanted this inquiry, called the Certain  Maritime Incident Committee or CMI Committee, to uncover the truth about  the children overboard lie - the how, when and why of the Government’s  deceit.    

 While the CMI Committee enabled us to investigate the children overboard lie,  it also allowed us to scrutinise many aspects of the Howard Government’s  asylum seeker policy.    

 Today, because of the work of the CMI Committee - especially the work of  my colleagues Jacinta Collins and Peter Cook, we know a great deal more  about the Government’s response to asylum seekers than otherwise would be  the case. David Marr who co-authored Dark Victory believes that if it were not  for the CMI Committee most of this information would not have been  revealed to public scrutiny until 30 years after the event1. The exhaustive  cross-examination of witnesses would not have taken place.   

 The response to boat people or asylum seekers was the main focus of the  Howard Government in the lead up to the last federal election. The  Government’s strategy was based on politicising the asylum seeker issue for  electoral advantage. It wasn’t just the Tampa episode, or the bald faced lies  about children being thrown overboard, it was a systematic campaign to  engender public fear about asylum seekers and the need to protect our  borders against them at all costs.    

 But, what has interested me most of all about the Howard Government’s  asylum seeker policy - is the largely unknown policy to deter and disrupt  people smugglers and asylum seekers in Indonesia - the so called disruption  programme.    

 Tonight I want to focus on the disruption programme - the most clandestine  part of the Howard Government’s people smuggling policy. Very substantial  resources in the Australian Embassy in Jakarta have been used to support this

 policy and yet, we still know little about the programme. What we do know  raises serious questions that warrant serious answers.    

 CMI Committee - expansion of the terms of reference   

 It may surprise you to know that it was the Liberal Senators on the CMI  Committee who wanted to expand the Committees’ terms of reference so that  all aspects of the Government’s anti-people smuggling policy could be  examined. Originally the CMI Committee was only going to look at the  children overboard episode.    

 Labor agreed to their proposal. The Liberals thought this expansion would be  politically beneficial. They thought they could expose the behaviour of  desperate asylum seekers and “dehumanise” them. How wrong they were. I  believe this was a real political own goal because it gave us a capacity to raise  questions regarding the Tampa, SIEVX and the Government’s disruption  policy.    

 SIEVX   

 While the Government has claimed that Operation Relex (which aims to deter  asylum seeker vessels approaching Australia through constant sea and air  surveillance between Australia and Indonesia) had a significant impact on  deterring asylum seekers from taking risky voyages to Australia by boat - I’m  sure the SIEVX disaster also had a great impact.    

 The people smuggling vessel, now referred to as SIEVX, was organised by  people smuggler Abu Quassey. On the 19th October 2001, a day after SIEVX  set sail for Australia, the vessel suddenly sank. Three hundred and fifty three  people, including 142 women and 146 children, drowned2. After a night in the  water, two fishing boats rescued just 44 survivors from SIEVX.   

 The news that SIEVX had sunk killing around 350 passengers received  worldwide coverage. This coverage sent a clear message of the high risks of  such a voyage.    

 Much has been written about the SIEVX disaster since that time. The CMI  Committee investigated why the Australian Defence Force, who were  surveilling the area where SIEVX sank, by air and by sea, did not sight the  vessel.    

 Even the question of where SIEVX sank has been extraordinarily difficult to  nail down. Let’s examine the evidentiary record.

 Two pieces of evidence support claims SIEVX sank in Indonesian waters:    

 1. The Defence Department Operation Gaberdine/Op Relex report dated  23 October 2001 stated SIEVX “is suspected to have sunk inside ID TS  [Indonesian Territorial Seas]”; and 

 2. Defence Head of Staff Brigadier Millen at the Australian Embassy in  Jakarta phoned through to Canberra on the 23rd October that SIEVX  “sunk in Indonesian territorial seas”.   

 Four pieces of evidence support claims SIEVX sank in International waters:   

 1. The People Smuggling taskforce notes from the 23 October 2001 state  “Vessel likely to have been in international waters south of Java”;  2. A DFAT Cable dated 23 October 2001 indicates “The exact position of  the vessel at the time of sinking is unknown but it is judged as no 

 further south than 8 degrees south latitude on a direct line from  Sunda Strait to Christmas Is”;  3. A DIMA Intelligence Note dated 23 October 2001 states “At about  1400 hours on Friday [19 October], when approximately 60 Nautical 

 Miles south of the Sunda Strait, the boat began taking water and  finally capsized and sank at about 1500 hours”; and  4. A report from the Harbourmaster’s office at Sundu Kelapa in North  Jakarta dated 24 October 2001 indicates that the fishing boats 

 rescued the survivors from SIEVX in international waters.    

 Given this evidence how could John Howard have claimed during the election  campaign that SIEVX “sank…in Indonesian waters, not in Australian waters. It  sunk in Indonesian waters and apparently that is our fault”3.   

 As far as the Australian Defence Force is concerned I am sure it would be in  their interest to end the public debate over Operation Relex’s surveillance at  the time of SIEVX’s sinking. And the best way to do that is to have as much  information on the public record as possible about the ADF’s operations.    

 I note the ADF worked assiduously to cooperate with the CMI Committee -  even when the Government and Defence Minister Robert Hill were  deliberately obstructive.   

 That said, and I want to make this clear, we have seen no evidence to  support claims that the Australian Defence Force ignored the plight of those  onboard SIEVX. And without any evidence I will draw no such conclusions.    

 But Labor Senators will not shirk from seeking answers to questions on these  issues. We have not done so in the past and we will certainly not do so if  further questions arise.

 Regardless, I do believe the circumstances surrounding the departure from  Indonesia of SIEVX warrant further and closer investigation.    

 SIEVX survivors themselves have provided information about their voyage  that raises serious concern.    

 Before SIEVX departed it was very low in the water and horribly overcrowded,  carrying four times the number of passengers a vessel of its size should  carry4. About 30 Indonesian police were present. They beat some of the  passengers and forced asylum seekers to board at gunpoint. The police  appeared to be actively involved in the people smuggling operation5.   

 SIEVX survivor Issam Ismail’s account is disturbing:    

 “The Indonesian Police were there. They were carrying automatic  guns. They were so comfortable. They were the ones who gave the  signals with their torches. Turning on the torch was a signal to send  out people. Turning off the torch meant stop. That was how it was  done. We saw them with our own eyes. They had weapons we had  never seen before. The latest brands”.6     

 It only took minutes for SIEVX to sink. Bahram Khan, from Jalalabad in  Afghanistan, said “The hull sprang a hole. The mechanic could not fix it and  the boat sank”.7   

 On the 25 October 2001 Prime Minister Howard was reported to be seeking  more information about whether the reports that Indonesian security  personnel forced asylum seekers onto SIEVX at gunpoint were true8. Since  then the Prime Minister has not made public what information, if any, he  received about the situation surrounding the departure of SIEVX.     

 SIEVX was not the only people smuggling vessel to get a send off from  Indonesian authorities.      

 As journalist Lindsay Murdoch in the Sydney Morning Herald reported in 2001,  “boats [from Indonesia] carrying hundreds of people have sunk, drowning all  aboard…Some survivors say Indonesian authorities have, at times, helped  push boats out to sea knowing they are not seaworthy”9.

 These boats include the KM Palapa which sank heading for the Australian  coast. Those on board the KM Palapa were rescued by the Tampa, the  Norwegian cargo ship. Passengers on the KM Palapa last year told a court  case in Perth that the Indonesian National Police were involved in the people  smuggling operation that organised the departure of their vessel from  Indonesia10.    

 Disruption   

 But there is an untold story of the Howard Government’s anti-people  smuggling policy - the disruption programme - the policy to deter and disrupt  people smugglers and asylum seekers from reaching Australia by boat from  Indonesia.    

 Last year I was able to explore the Government’s disruption policy through  the CMI Committee and at Senate Estimate hearings.   

 The people smuggling disruption programme can take a number of forms. For  example, through Australian officials informing people in Indonesia of the  dangers and risks associated with people smuggling, and the penalties they  might face.   

 I have no problem with this at all - but there was a more active element.    

 The Australian Federal Police explained last year, in broad terms, that the  primary objective of disruption is to:  “... prevent the departure of the vessel in the first instance, to deter or  dissuade passengers from actually boarding a vessel”.   

 The Department of Immigration goes further, indicating that disruption  involves the “interception at the actual point of attempting to continue their  journey, either by sea or air11.   

 Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty informed the CMI  Committee that once the Indonesians are tasked to disrupt then the AFP must  leave it in their hands “as to how best they do it”12.   

 AFP witnesses at the CMI Committee could not categorically rule out whether,  as a result of the people smuggling disruption program:   

  Ã  fuel suppliers had been encouraged not to supply fuel to people  smuggling vessels;   Ã  food had not been provided to people smuggling vessels;

    6 

  Ã  sugar had been put in the fuel tank of a people smuggling vessel, or  that;  Ã  sand was put in the engine of a vessel13.    

  But what is deeply concerning about the disruption program is that there  appear to be no accountability mechanisms - nothing to ensure that  Australia’s disruption policy does not lead to illegal or life threatening events,  either directly or indirectly.    

  We still do not know if disruption extends to physical interference with  vessels, nor do we know what consideration has been given to questions of  maritime safety.   

  Last year AFP informant Kevin Enniss, who admitted to taking money from  asylum seekers, also, according to Channel Nine’s Sunday programme,  bragged that he had paid Indonesian locals to scuttle people smuggling boats  with passengers onboard on four or five occasions. Mr Enniss claimed that  boats were sunk close to land so everyone got off safely14. Mr Enniss has  since denied involvement in sabotaging vessels in Indonesia15.   

  We do know a number of Australian agencies are involved in the People  Smuggling Disruption Programme. Along with the Australian Federal Police -  the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the Australian Secret  Intelligence Service (ASIS) and the Department of Immigration and  Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) all have a role.    

  Slowly but surely, details about Government funding and resources to support  the disruption programme in Indonesia are coming to light.    

  Specifically in relation to ASIS, Dark Victory reports one Canberra source  claimed that the Abu Quassey boat (or  SIEVX) was a target of ASIS -  Australia’s Foreign Intelligence Service - which by this stage had been  instructed by the Australian Government to disrupt people smuggling  operations in Indonesia16.

  A specific protocol between the Australian Federal Police and the  Indonesian National Police to target people smuggling syndicates  operating out of Indonesia;  Two Immigration positions at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta  created to primarily work on people smuggling matters;   Two AFP agents working out of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta and  reporting back to the people smuggling taskforce in Canberra on  disruption activities.17, and;  An Inter-Agency Co-ordination Group on People Smuggling at the  Australian Embassy in Jakarta involving the Ambassador and Foreign  Affairs, Immigration, Australian Federal Police and Defence  representatives. We know that disruption activities are a key focus of  this group.18   

  Minister’s knowledge of disruption?    

  Last year I began asking questions about Immigration Minister Philip  Ruddock’s trip to Jakarta in June 2001 but received little information from any  of the departments involved.    

  According to Dark Victory, when Mr Ruddock met with the Inter-Agency  People Smuggling Group on the 13 June 2001 at the Australian Embassy in  Jakarta, he raised the issue of piracy, and why pirates were not targeting  asylum seeker vessels.    

  Dark Victory sources claim that some present at the meeting thought Mr  Ruddock might be “thinking of some covert action involving pirates”. AFP  officer Leigh Dixon expressed frustration at Mr Ruddock’s line of questioning  and eventually cut him off saying he was unaware of the actions of pirates19.    

  Asked for a response to these allegations Mr Ruddock appeared to confirm  the conversation about pirates to the authors of Dark Victory David Marr and  Marian Wilkinson when he stated and I quote:   

  “There had been a great deal of public comment on that topic around  the time of several meetings I had during visits to Indonesia”20.    

  Mr Ruddock also provided Marr and Wilkinson with a copy of an article dated  19th July 2001 about the issue of piracy.    

  However this article explains little as it simply indicates that piracy was a  growing problem in the region, and that pirates primarily target cargo ships  not people smuggling vessels. I note the article was published a month after

  Mr Ruddock’s visit to the Australian Embassy in Jakarta - so it sheds no light  on why he would have raised the issue of piracy at the Embassy meeting.   

  In fact a search for media articles about the issue of piracy before Mr  Ruddock’s visit to Jakarta in June 2001 just draws a blank.    

  It is unclear why Mr Ruddock raised the issue of piracy at the Jakarta meeting  - it is clearly time for Mr Ruddock to explain himself.    

  According one of Wilkinson and Marr’s sources, who attended the same  meeting, Mr Ruddock also asked whether people smuggler boats could be  stopped by physically interfering with them. Mr Ruddock allegedly asked in a  joking tone ‘well could we interfere with the boats?’ Apparently in response  Federal Agent Dixon reminded Mr Ruddock of obligations under Australian  law. The conversation ended when Ruddock laughed the matter off and said  it was just a concept in the air21.    

  Mr Ruddock has not said whether the issue of sabotage was raised at this  meeting. Mr Ruddock has told David Marr and Marian Wilkinson; “I have no  formal recollection of any of those discussions which I am prepared to  discuss”22. Again, Mr Ruddock should come clean and say what he knows, or  knew, about any covert operations involving people smuggling vessels in  Indonesia.    

  Since the publication of Dark Victory Commissioner Keelty has confirmed that  AFP Officer Leigh Dixon, who was present at the June 2001 meeting,  discussed this matter with his superiors23. Commissioner Keelty has told a  Senate Committee that when he heard about the June meeting in Jakarta  involving Mr Ruddock he “expressed concern”24.    

  Let me say I have serious concerns about what took place at that meeting on  13 June 2001 at our embassy in Jakarta. I can assure you we will continue to  investigate what transpired at the meeting and what resulted from it.   

  In September 2001 the Indonesian Government cancelled the protocol on  people smuggling between the Australian Federal Police and the Indonesian  National Police. We still don’t know why the protocol was cancelled. I have  been informed by highly placed sources that the cancellation was at least in  part due to the Indonesian Government’s concerns about the disruption  programme.

  Despite the cancellation of the protocol, the Australian Federal Police and  their Indonesian counterparts agreed that disruption activities could continue,  on a case by case arrangement25.    

  From documents tabled at the CMI Committee it is clear that such activities  did continue after the protocol was cancelled. According to the Government’s  People Smuggling Task Force notes on the 12 October, just a week before  SIEVX sank, the taskforce discussed ways of “beefing up” disruption activity26  in Indonesia. According to Commissioner Keelty this probably was an  “operational call along the lines of: ‘The departure of the vessel is imminent;  we’d better be doing everything we can possibly do’”27 to stop the vessel.   

  What I want to know about the disruption program in Indonesia is what  precisely Australian or Indonesian authorities were doing in order to disrupt  vessels? What activities were acceptable or sanctioned; what were not?  Where were the checks? What were the accountability measures? How can  we be satisfied lives were not put at risk?   

  It is all very well for Australian authorities to assure us that everything done  in Indonesia to disrupt people smuggling vessels was legal. But given that no  accountability mechanisms appeared to be in place - how can we be sure?   

  I believe the only way we can be certain that nothing illegal or inappropriate  has occurred under the auspices of the disruption program is through a full  and independent judicial inquiry. I have consistently called for such an inquiry  to be established. The CMI Committee in its final report also called for such  an inquiry. Its establishment remains a high priority.   

  Australian Government focus - after 11 September 2001     

  While the Howard Government was beefing up its disruption programme in  Indonesia, the world was beginning to focus on the very real threat of  terrorism after the attacks in America on September 11.     

  September 11 was more than just a wake up call to the nations of South East  Asia. It became clear very quickly that al Qaeda was active in our region. In  December 2001 the Singapore Government’s Internal Security Department  arrested and detained 13 members of the al Qaeda-affiliated group Jemaah  Islamiah who were planning to bomb a number of sites in Singapore possibly  including the United States and Israeli Embassies and the Australian High  Commission.    

  The Singapore High Commissioner Ashok Mirpuri, in a letter to the Financial  Review in April 2002 indicated “only the blind would have missed the

  increased religiosity and radicalism of Islam” in South East Asia and even his  Government had been surprised to find that “jihad terrorism” could win  converts in Singapore28.    

  Australia’s intelligence effort in Jakarta   

  It is interesting to note according to Dark Victory, that while intelligence  chiefs in Canberra after September 11 switched their focus and priority to the  terrorist threat at home and abroad, Australia’s intelligence effort in Jakarta  remained strongly focused on people smuggling. This was despite the  warnings the United States Embassy in Jakarta gave to the Australian  Embassy about the activities of al Qaeda in Indonesia29.    

  Marian Wilkinson has claimed that there is a serious question mark over  whether the Government gave the al-Qaeda threat in Indonesia the attention  it demanded before the Bali bombings. An intelligence expert even told  Wilkinson “Those of us who believed the threat was there were called  alarmists and pessimists, but we called ourselves realists”30.    

  Research fellow at the Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence  at St Andrews University in Scotland, Rohan Gunaratna, has expressed similar  concerns:   

  “Despite a dozen Australian citizens and residents having participated  in JI and Al Qaeda training camps from Mindanao in the Philippines to  Afghanistan, the Government’s assessments and operational agencies  did not believe that the threat was ‘significant’ until the Bali bombings  happened”31.    

  Howard Government’s response to September 11   

  So there is an issue here, because, although the Howard Government  announced a number of counter terrorism initiatives after September 11  Australia’s focus in Indonesia appears to have remained well and truly on the  electorally sensitive issue of people smuggling.    

  Well, could more have been done in the fight against terrorism in our region?   

  Let’s look at the record. Let’s compare the initiatives the Government has  taken in our region on people smuggling to those it has taken in the fight  against terrorism, particularly after September 11.

  â¢ In 2000 the Howard Government signed a specific protocol under the  existing MOU with Indonesia to “target people smuggling syndicates  operating out of Indonesia”.  

  â¢ In 2002 Australia signed a Memorandum of Understanding with  Indonesia to counter terrorism.  Ã  In February 2002 and in April 2003 Australia and Indonesia co-chaired  a Regional Ministerial Conference on People Smuggling, Trafficking in 

  Persons and Related Transnational Crime. In two to three years time  there will be another regional conference on people smuggling.  Ã  In March 2003 Alexander Downer announced that the Howard  Government would organise in the next year an ASEAN regional 

  workshop on managing the consequences of a terrorist attack as well  as arranging with the Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia  Pacific a regional conference on security issues including terrorism.  However to date the Australian Government has not organised a  regional conference specifically focused on fighting terrorism - despite  Labor’s calls for one.   â¢ 

  â¢ 

  

  In early 2002 Australia created the new position of Ambassador for  People Smuggling “to promote a coherent and effective international  approach to combating people smuggling, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region”.   In early 2003, almost six months after the Bali Bombings, the  Government created the new position of an Ambassador for Counter-Terrorism. Last weekend it was announced that the Counter-Terrorism  Ambassador Nick Warner, who had only been in the job for a few  months, would now lead the Australian intervention force in the  Solomons. What does this mean for Mr Warner’s role as Ambassador  for Counter-Terrorism?     

  Don’t forget that the Howard Government has tried to link the terrorism and  asylum seeker issues.     

  During the last election campaign the Howard Government made the false  claim that asylum seekers arriving on boats might be terrorists.   

  It was the then Defence Minister Peter Reith who first made this outrageous  claim in a blaze of publicity - without any evidence to support it at all.     

  In the final week of the 2001 election campaign John Howard told the public  and I quote:    

  “I mean you have to be able to say that there is a possibility that some  people having links with organisations that we don’t want in this  country might use the path of an asylum seeker in order to get here”32.

  Again, there was no truth to this claim. As ASIO Director Dennis Richardson  indicated last year, none of the illegal immigrants arriving in Australia by boat  to date had “received an adverse security assessment in terms of posing a  direct or indirect threat to Australia’s security”33. Richardson debunked the  idea at a conference in Hobart in May 2002 when he said:   

  “Why would people use the asylum seeker stream when they know  they will be subject to mandatory detention?”34   

  The Government’s claims that asylum seekers might be terrorists were really  low rent politics from a low rent Government. What else would you expect  from the same Government who were directing the Defence Department  during the 2001 election not to take “personalising or humanising images” of  asylum seekers35. Put simply, suggesting asylum seekers might be terrorists  was just another way to fudge the facts and debase the political process right  at the most sensitive time of the electoral cycle.    

  Conclusion   

  When another asylum seeker boat arrived off the West Australian Coast a  couple of weeks ago with about 50 Vietnamese people onboard seeking  asylum - John Howard indicated that he was prepared to spend whatever  money it took to deter boatpeople from arriving on the Australian mainland36.    

  Well, already an awful lot of taxpayer’s dollars have been spent. But have  there been other costs?   

  What has been the cost of the Howard Government’s disruption programme  in Indonesia - not just the financial cost?    

  I said recently in Parliament and I have no reason to change my view:   

  “The issue of sabotage of people smugglers' vessels has been  canvassed by the AFP informant Kevin Enniss. I ask these questions:  was Enniss involved in the sabotage of vessels? Were others involved  in the sabotage of vessels? Do Australian ministers, officials or  agencies have knowledge of such activities? And what about the vessel  now known as SIEVX, part of the people-smuggling operation of the  notorious people smuggler Abu Quassey? That vessel set sail on 18  October 2001 and sank on 19 October 2001, drowning 353 people,  including 142 women and 146 children. Were disruption activities  directed against Abu Quassey? Did these involve SIEVX?

  Ladies and Gentleman, I hope you agree that although this issue may not be  popular; although these matters may not win many votes; a serious  Opposition cannot resile from pursuing them and holding the Howard  Government and its Ministers accountable for their decisions and their  actions.
