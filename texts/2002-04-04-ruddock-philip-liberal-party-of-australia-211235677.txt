 PREFERRED SITE FOR NEW DETENTION FACILITY IN SE QUEENSLAND

 The  Minister  for  Immigration  and  Multicultural  and  Indigenous  Affairs,  Philip  Ruddock, announced today that a site at Pinkenba was the preferred location for the new Immigration Detention Centre in south east Queensland.

 “Following  a  comprehensive  search by my Department  of  available  Commonwealth  land,  a portion  of  the  Meeandah  Army  Stores  site  on  Sugarmill  Road  has  been  selected  as  the preferred site for the new Immigration Detention Centre,” Mr Ruddock said.

 The  focus  for  the  planned  facility  is  the  Queensland  compliance  caseload,  covering  visa overstayers,  those  found  working  in  breach  of  their  visa  conditions  and  unauthorised  air arrivals.   It  is  not  envisaged  that  it  will  house  boat  arrivals  from  interstate.   The  centre  will initially  provide  200  beds  with  core  services  capacity  to  enable  expansion,  if  required,  in future years.

 “The new centre will enable these people to be held in a purpose designed and built facility rather than the Arthur Gorrie prison, the city watchhouse, local motels - as is currently the case for women and children - or transferred interstate,” Mr Ruddock said.

 “A  purpose  built  immigration  facility  will  also  provide  a  far  more  cost-effective  method  of managing unlawful non-citizens in Queensland.

 “While  a  preferred  site  for  the  facility  has  been  identified,  my  Department  will  continue  to examine  other  options  that  may  also  be  available.   This  will  include  discussions  with  a number  of  municipal  authorities  outside  Brisbane,  following  expressions  of  interest  in  the development of a detention facility in their area,” Mr Ruddock said.

 A  final  decision  on  the  location  of  the  facility  will  be  taken,  following  the  completion  of community  consultation  processes.   The  timetable  for  construction  of  the  facility  will  be established following a final decision on the site, and the consideration by the Government of detailed costs estimates.

 Immigration  detention  is  administrative  in  nature  and  is  not,  in  any  way,  designed  for  the purposes of punishment.  A full range of services will be provided at the facilities to ensure the proper care and protection of women and children. The residents will also be encouraged to be responsible for their own personal care and self management.

 The  Minister  announced  on  3  April  2002  the  selection  of  a  number  of  Australia’s  leading architectural  firms  which  will  participate  in  a  design  competition  for  new  immigrations detention facilities.

 The final designs will include a medium level security perimeter.

 “This project will advance the quality and style of detention facilities in Australia while at the same  time  maintaining  the  appropriate  standard  of  care  already  provided  for  people  in immigration detention,” Mr Ruddock said.
