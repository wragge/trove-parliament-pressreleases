 The Federal Coalition has learned nothing from its past mistakes judging by its canvassing of Temporary 

 Protection Visas under another name, according to Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young. 

 Senator Hanson-Young, Greens spokesperson for Immigration and Human Rights is visiting Christmas Island to 

 observe conditions for asylum seekers. She says the Greens would never support the re-introduction of temporary 

 visas which would leave genuine refugees with the threat of return to war-torn homelands hanging over their 

 heads.  

 "We know that the use of Temporary Protection Visas was extremely damaging to refugees,'' Senator Hanson-Young said. 

 "Grantin



 g only temporary protection status to people who have already proved their need for protection condemns 

 them to limbo and the imminent threat of a return to persecution.''  

 "You can't put a timeframe on these threats - we know that under TPVs some people were returned to their 

 homelands such as Afghanistan and were subsequently killed. 

 "This proposal is just a throwback to the failed policies of the Howard Government and I call on the rational voices 

 in the Coalition party room to ensure this proposal is left where it belongs, as a relic of Australia‘s political past.'' 

 Indonesia's role in monitoring and processing for asylum seekers raises questions for Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, 

 Senator Hanson-Young says. 

 "It's not good enough for Mr Rudd to ask the Indonesians to push the boats back, ‘' she said. 

 "The Prime Minister should pick up the phone and urge his Indonesian counterpart to sign the United Nations 

 Refugee Convention.'' 

 The Greens believe Australia should be showing leadership and bringing its regional neighbours together to help 

 process these people before they jump on leaky boats. 

 "We need a regional refugee program that guarantees humane and fair treatment and rights for asylum seekers 

 under international laws,'' Senator Hanson-Young said.
