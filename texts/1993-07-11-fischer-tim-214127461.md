 REPRIEVE URGED FOR AUSSIE MINE-HUNTERS The Federal Government should grant an 11th hour reprieve for the  Australian peace-keeping operation in Pakistan, the Federal  Leader of the National Party, Tim Fischer, urged today.

 Mr Fischer said the withdrawal of the Australian force, about to  take effect, was a symptom of the "forgotten crisis" of 

 Afghanistan.

 "Most Australians are probably not aware that there are diggers  working on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, carrying out lifeÂ­ saving training," he said from Peshawar.

 The force comprises a 10-man team on a six-month rotation which  trains refugees from the Afghan war in identification and  disabling of mines, plus three technical advisers on a 12-month  rotation.

 They are based in Peshawar, but often conduct training within  Afghanistan.

 "The current training team is scheduled to leave within weeks and  I understand will not be replaced," Mr Fischer said.

 "This is despite the fact that this is a life-saving task, and  from all accounts the Australians have been doing a wonderful job  and a job that still needs to be done." I

 Mr Fischer said there were still an estimated two million  refugees from the Afghan war of the early 1980s in Pakistan alone  - unable to return home because of the devastation of their  homeland, including an estimated 10 million unexploded mines.

 "The Afghans are becoming the forgotten people of the aid  industry as world attention turns to later* disasters like Bosnia  and Somalia," Mr Fischer said.

 "I understand how that happens, but it will be a great pity if  Australia proceeds with its premature withdrawal of these  peacekeepers, and forgets the Afghans too."

 Mr Fischer added that he supported fully comments by the Shadow  Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Hill, that the Australian  contingent had been a particularly successful, small but  effective, UN peacekeeping operation.
