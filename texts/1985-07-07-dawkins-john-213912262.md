 REFORM OF YOUTH INCOME SUPPORT

 In a speech to the Youth Forum in Bathurst today, the   Minister for Trade and Minister Assisting the Prime   Minister for Youth Affairs, John Dawkins, set out the case   for reform of youth income support arrangements. He drew   attention to Australia's need for an educated and skilled   workforce if it is to be competitive in international  

 trade, and said that education allowances should be at   least as high as unemployment benefit to remove the   present financial incentive for young people to leave   education and training.

 Mr Dawkins was also critical of what he said was   Australia's failure to adapt programs like unemployment   benefit to changed economic and social conditions. He   pointed out that our income support response to  

 large-scale unemployment had simply been to increase   social security outlays on which there was no public   return. The unemployment benefit system was never   designed to handle mass, long-term unemployment. It was   designed to provide bridging income for workers   temporarily between jobs in a full employment economy.

 "We still live in the lucky country, but the luck is   running out", Mr Dawkins said. "The standard of living we   have come to expect as our right is built on our ability   to sell our products abroad. The international demand for  

 our main exports - minerals and agricultural products - is   depressed and likely to remain so. We will therefore have   to rely more and more on export of our manufactures and   services, products whose success or failure depends mainly   on the trained intellect and skill of those who conceive,   design, manufacture and market them. The alternative is  

 starkly, a decline in our standard of living".

 2 .

 In Mr Dawkins view the answer lay in financially   e n c o uraging young people to undertake activities like   education and training, which enhance long-term employment   and earning prospects, increase the productive potential   and our economy, and offer promise of reducing long-term  

 income inequalities. He pointed out that the $120m paid   last year in unemployment benefits to 16 and 17 year olds,   who w ould better have been continuing in education or   training, was of benefit to them but no long-term benefit  

 to the nation. This was in part a failure of the   education system to reorder its priorities in such a way   as to make the curriculum relevant to young people who   were looking for preparation for work rather than for   higher education.

 . THAT A C T I V IT I E S  WHICH HELP THE GENERAL WELFARE

 STRONGLY AFFECTED BY PARENTAL AND PEER ATTITUDES;

 . SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS -  THE DISADVANTAGED OFTEN 

 FEEL THAT EDUCATION IS SOMEHOW NOT FOR THEM;

 TO THESE COULD BE ADDED: SEX; INTELLECTUAL A B I L I T Y ;

 ETHNIC O R IG IN ; PLACE OF RESIDENCE AND EMPLOYMENT 

 PROSPECTS.

 THAT 16 AND 17 YEAR OLDS WHO HAD NEVER HELD A JOB COULD 

 DECIDE NOT TO CONTINUE IN EDUCATION OR TRAINING AND STILL 

 RECEIVE INCOME SUPPORT.

 I  QUOTE THEIR REPORT:

 " A u s t r a l i a  i s  u n i q u e  among th e OECD c o u n t r i e s  i n  

 a l l o w in g  v i r t u a l l y  u n r e s t r i c t e d  ac c e s s  to 

 u n e m p lo y m e n t  b e n e f i t s  for youth  as young  as 16 FOR as

 LONG AS THEY ARE UNEMPLOYED", THEY SAID. "VIRTUALLY 

 ALL OTHER COUNTRIES REQUIRE SOME PRIOR EMPLOYMENT 

 EXPERIENCE. RESTRICT THE PERIOD OF BENEFITS, OR AFTER 

 A PERIOD OF TIME IMPOSE EDUCATION OR TRAINING 

 REQUIREMENTS AS A CONDITION FOR FURTHER 

 E L I G I B I L I T Y " .  UNQUOTE.

 I MAKE TWO OBSERVATIONS ON T H IS . THE FIRST IS THAT THE  UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT SYSTEM WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO HANDLE 

 MASS, LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT. IT WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE 

 BRIDGING INCOME FOR WORKERS TEMPORARILY BETWEEN JOBS IN A 

 FULL. EMPLOYMENT ECONOMY. MY SECOND OBSERVATION RELATES TO 

 THE FIRST. WE HAVE FAILED TO ADAPT PROGRAMS LIKE 

 UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT TO CHANGED ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL 

 CONDITIONS. OUR INCOME SUPPORT RESPONSE TO LARGE-SCALE 

 UNEMPLOYMENT HAS SIMPLY BEEN TO INCREASE SOCIAL SECURITY 

 OUTLAYS ON WHICH THERE IS NO PUBLIC RETURN. THE $ 1 2 0 m 

 PAID IN UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT TO 16 AND 17 YEAR OLDS IN 

 1984 HAS BEEN OF BENEFIT TO THE INDIVIDUAL RECIPIENTS BUT 

 OF NO LONG-TERM BENEFIT TO THE NATION. SHOULD WE NOT 

 INSTEAD BE ENCOURAGING A CTIV ITY  LIKE EDUCATION AND 

 TRAINING WHICH ENHANCE LONG-TERM EMPLOYMENT AND EARNING 

 PROSPECTS, INCREASE THE PRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL OF OUR

 8

 ECONOMY, AND OFFER SOME PROMISE OF REDUCING LONG-TERM 

 INCOME IN E Q U A L IT IE S ?  T H IS  IS  THE APPROACH URGED ON THE

 Go v e r n m e n t  by b o th the OECD and  the K i r b y  Co m m i t t e e  of 

 En q u i r y  i n t o  L abour  Ma r k e t  P r o g r a m s .

 Why am I c o n c e r n e d , as was OECD, to see  more  young  p e o p l e

 STAY ON TO THE END OF SECONDARY SCHOOLING OR ITS 

 EQUIVALENT IN TH E T A F E  SYSTEM? I T  IS NOT TO REDUCE THE 

 UNEMPLOYMENT S T A T IS T IC S . AS THE OPPOSITION SOMETIMES 

 SUGGESTS. I T  IS NOT SOLELY BECAUSE I  BELIEVE THAT 

 EDUCATION IS INTRINSICALLY GOOD FOR BOTH THE INDIVIDUAL 

 AND THE COMMUNITY. ALTHOUGH I  DO. I T  IS . AS I  SUGGESTED 

 AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS SPEECH. BECAUSE I  HAVE A CARE 

 ABOUT MY OWN OLD AGE AND. LESS SELFISHLY. THE FUTURE OF MY 

 COUNTRY.

 I t WILL HELP ME TO EXPLAIN MY CONCERN IF I  PUT ON MY OTHER  

 HAT AS MINISTER FOR TRADE. ALL TOO OFTEN, I T  SEEMS TO ME,  

 THE YOUTH INCOME SUPPORT DEBATE IS CONDUCTED IN A VACUUM,  

 AS IF  I T  IS AN INTELLECTUAL EXERCISE WHICH BEARS NO  

 RELATIONSHIP TO THE FUTURE CAPACITY OF AUSTRALIA TO EARN  

 ITS WAY IN THE WORLD.

 WE S T ILL  LIVE IN THE LUCKY COUNTRY, BUT THE LUCK IS 

 RUNNING OUT. THE STANDARD OF LIVING WE" HAVE COME TO 

 EXPECT AS OUR RIGHT IS BUILT ON OUR A B IL IT Y  TO SELL OUR

 PRODUCTS ABROAD. THE INTERNATIONAL DEMAND FOR OUR MAIN 

 EXPORTS -  MINERALS AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS -  IS

 9

 DEPRESSED AND L IK E L Y  TO REMAIN SO. WE WILL THEREFORE HAVE 

 TO RELY MORE AND MORE ON EXPORT OF OUR MANUFACTURES AND 

 SERVICES. PRODUCTS. WHOSE SUCCESS OR FAILURE DEPENDS MAINLY 

 ON THE TRAINED INTELLECT AND S KILL OF THOSE WHO CONCEIVE. 

 DESIGN. MANUFACTURE AND MARKET THEM. THE ALTERNATIVE I S .  

 STARKLY. A DECLINE IN  OUR STANDARD OF L I V I N G .

 I F  ALL THIS SEEMS REMOTE FROM WHETHER YOU DECIDE TO 

 COMPLETE SECONDARY SCHOOL OR A COURSE OF VOCATIONAL 

 T R A IN IN G . OR NOT. LET ME ASSURE YOU THAT THE CONNECTION IS 

 A VERY CLOSE ONE. THERE WAS A T IM E . NOT SO LONG AGO. WHEN

 SOPHISTICATED AND SKILLED WORKFORCE IN OUR PART OF THE

 FALLEN SINCE THEN : WHETHER THAT IS TRUE OR NOT. I T  IS NOT 

 PARTICULARLY RELEVANT. WHAT IS RELEVANT IS THAT THE 

 COUNTRIES OF OUR REGION HAVE BEEN EDUCATING AND TRAINING 

 THEIR WORKFORCES AT SPECTACULAR RATES, SO THAT OUR 

 COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IN THIS FIELD HAS BEEN GREATLY 

 ERODED AND IN SOME CASES HAS ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED.

 On l y a c o n c e r t e d  e f f o r t  to e x p l o i t  to the f u l l  our

 NATIONAL INTELLECTUAL RESOURCES HOLDS OUT ANY PROSPECT 

 THAT WE MIGHT REDRESS THE BALANCE. WE CAN NO LONGER

 OF THEIR POTENTIAL. A GOVERNMENT WOULD BE DERELICT IN ITS

 DUTY I F  I T  DENIED ANY YOUNG PERSON SUCH OPPORTUNITY. JUST

 BACKGROUND PAPER

 YOUTH INCOME SUPPORT - THE NEED FOR REFORM

 There have been few issues on which Government has spent· so  much time over the past year as youth income support. While  there is no doubt about the agreement on the need for change,  the reasons for that change and the appropriate form that 

 change should take are far from agreed. This in part is an  indication of the vacuum in which the debate on youth income  support has been undertaken. ..

 It is time to widen that debate and to fill the vacuum. We  need to consider the longer term interests of our young  people so as to avoid the current position of social  dependence, the waste of their abilities and the alienation 

 of so many of them. We need to connect the types of income  support we make available to young people and their longer  term potential to make a productive contribution to our  society.

 CURRENT POSITION

 There is no doubt about the deficiencies in current youth  income support arrangements. With 37 different payments for  which young people could be eligible, it is extremely .  difficult for young people or their parents to know, not only  what is available to them, but what it is in their interests 

 to apply for. .

 The complexities and anomalies in the allowance structure are  best illustrated at TAFE where there are both secondary and  tertiary courses, a distinction which is becoming  increasingly blurred.· Counsellors are spending more and more 

 time assisting students to find their way through the  allowance maze to determine, for example, whether it is  Transition Allowance, TEAS, SAS, ASEAS, Pre-apprenticeships  Allowance or even unemployment benefit for which a student  might be eligible. And there will be some students not 

 eligible for any of these payments such as a secondary  student wishing to do the equivalent of year 10 or a student  without parental support.

 Even with the three most important payments, UB, TEAS and SAS  there are many major differences in conditions attached to  them, putting aside for the moment the differences in rates  of payment which tend to favour UB. For example: UB and TEAS are paid direct to young people but SAS is paid to 

 parents; UB is paid fortnightly, TEAS monthly and SAS once a  term; UB is taxable but TEAS and SAS are not; SAS and TEAS  students, if they come from a pensioner/beneficiary family,  attract the additional pension/benefit paid for children but

 - 2-

 the young unemployed do not; there is a parental income test   on TEAS and on SAS but not on UB and there is a personal   income test on UB and TEAS but not on S A S ; a n d , finally TEAS   is the only one of these payments with a living away from   home rate.

 ISSUES

 it is no wonder that the Government wants to rationalise and   simplify the very different conditions under which young   people of a similar age currently receive paym e n t s . But   current arrangements are not only complex; they leave gaps  

 in support and also are not at all conducive to participation   in education and training.

 Over the past y e a r , youth income support arrangements have   been placed under intensive s c r u t i n y , which has clarified   differences in point of view on the relative priority which   should be accorded to removing disincentives, reducing  

 complexity, obtaining greater adequacy and equity. Not all   have agreed with the assertion of the OECD Review Team, which   recently reviewed our youth policies, that the most important   income support concern is with the incentive effects of   current arran g e m e n t s .

 Some of the specific threshold issues which government has   debated at some length have included:

 . What should be the relativities· between the level of UB   and educational allowances - should education allowances   exceed levels of UB (as the OECD would suggest), equal   the level of UB or lie somewhat below the level of UB?

 . How much should those living away from home receive   compared to those living with their parents?

 . What should happen to personal and parental income   tests? Should we move toward greater uniformity as   between schemes or is there a strong case for treating,   say the unemployed, quite differently from students? '

 . How should special needs groups be treated, particularly   young people from pensioner/beneficiary families? Should they attract a higher total level of payment than   other young people as is the current position?

 . Given limited funds, how should rates be rationalised?

 These are hard decisions for a government conscious of its   limited budgetary resources. And debate about these issues   reflects that fact. But the debate also reflects two other   factors: lack of adequate knowledge about the effects that any changed arrangements might have on education   participation a n d , more fundamentally, a lack of clarity   about the ultimate objectives of any reform. These two

 issues are dealt with in turn.

 INCENTIVES AND DISINCENTIVES

 Many factors are known to affect decisions as to whether a

 young person remains in or returns to education. Studies suggest the importance of such factors as parental a t t i t u d e s ,family income and socio-economic status, returns to education and labour force participation as well as the availability of education/training places and the quality of

 courses.

 There is no solid evidence about the relative importance of   these factors, especially of the importance of financial   factors and, in particular, the extent to which income   support measures may be discouraging young people from   pursuing education. What evidence is. available suggests that   young people from low income families are more responsive to  

 financial incentives than are other groups in their choice   between types of activity and hence these disadvantaged young   people are most likely to respond to a reordering of   incentives. And, most importantly, given our wider youth   policy objectives, they are also the group of young people â   

 likely to gain most benefit from education in so far as   education will provide the opportunity for greater socio­ economic equality.

 The OECD Team, in its review of Australia's income support   arrangements, expressed this point somewhat differently. Its view was that unless education and training were made   more attractive than unemployment then some disadvantaged-   young people may never get the education and training they  

 need to break out of an employment cycle "alternating between   low paying jobs for unskilled workers and unemployment."

 Despite some uncertainty on how important income support is   in decisions to participate in education, two points of   relevance to the Commonwealth government need to be borne in   mind: first, income support payments alongside the provision

 of places, are a direct and important way in which the   Commonwealth, as distinct from the States, can influence '

 education participation and second, the direction of   disincentives within the current system of Commonwealth ~   payments is easy to identify - there is an immediate   financial disincentive to continue in secondary education or,,   particularly from age 18, to pursue higher education.

 One way in which the Commonwealth could assist young people   in pursuing their goals is to provide much easier access to   services than are currently available. Several recent   reports have drawn attention to the difficulties young people   face in gaining access to government and other services and,   this in itself could well mean, through lack of knowledge   about alternatives available, a lower rate of participation

 in education and training than might otherwise be the case.  

 O BJECTIVES OF REFORM

 This raises the more fundamental question which seems to have   been the missing part of the debate so far - what is the '  

 ultimate objective of providing young people with income   support? In addressing this question, we must assume that   income support sits along side and complements other youth   policies including a range of education and training   opportunities.

 Australia has been fortunate in having the OECD, Mr Kirby and   Professor Karmel thoroughly examine the needs of our young   people in a broad economic and social context. Professor   K a r m e l 1s Committee on the Quality of Education in Australia  

 did not. deal directly with income support issues but the   Committee did isolate out as a priority the need for raising   p a r t i cipation in years 11 and 12 by disadvantaged groups.   Professor Karmel has therefore reinforced earlier studies on  

 the importance of this m a t t e r .

 The view of the OECD R eview-Team and the Kirby Inquiry is   that any reform of youth income support arrangements, should,   alongside other important components of. a comprehensive   approach to youth n e e d s , attempt to enhance the long term   employment and earnings prospects of young people and le a d ,   not only to an improvement in the general level of education  

 and skills of the labour force but also lead to greater   income equality in the longer term and greater national   prosperity.

 The OECD and Kirby considered that the current conditions "for   receipt of unemployment benefit act as a barrier against   improving a young person's long term prospects. They argued   for a shift in emphasis away from passive 1 income support   o n l y 1 types of assistance such as UB, toward training,   education and employment programs which include income  

 support. If this were to o c c u r , young people from poor   families would not have their employment, education and   training choices dep e n d e n t , as they are at the moment, on   short term financial considerations.

 The OECD and Kirby perspective promotes simultaneously   efficiency and equity objectives. Efficiency is promoted if   young people are more productively engaged. There are   several reasons why it is urgent to raise the productivity of  

 young p e o p l e :

 . There has been a sharp decline in the demand for teenage   labour over the past d e c a d e . Full-time jobs available   to 15-17 year olds fell by a quarter between 1981 and   1984 and the younger the job seeker the more devastating   the decline. There is unlikely to be an immediate

 reversal in the trend away from full-time job  opportunities for teenagers.

 . The likelihood of becoming and remaining unemployed is  significantly higher among young people who do not  complete year 12. A recent ABS survey showed that, of  those contacted within 12 months of leaving school and  who were in the labour force, the unemployment rate was 

 23% for those not completing year 12 but 12% for those  who did. The Bureau of Labour Market Research, in the  first phase of its longitudinal study of the young  unemployed, has found that higher levels of education  are associated with shorter durations of unemployment 

 and that there is a reasonably strong impact of  education on labour force experience.

 . Young people excluded from education and work and who  become welfare clients at an early age are likely to  become long term dependants on the welfare system. As  far as possible we must avoid the problem of  perpetuation of poverty from one generation to another  because of the relationship between schooling and 

 unemployment and poverty.

 To pursue the goal of efficiency through youth policies,  including obtaining the appropriate financial incentives, is  also to pursue the goal of equity. It is the most  disadvantaged who are likely to benefit from a reorientation 

 of incentives and the removal of the access barriers many  young people currently face in their attempt to pursue  worthwhile activities.

 The OECD argued that, with these goals in mind, Australia  should consider making eligibility for unemployment benefit  beyond a certain period of unemployment, dependent upon a  young person enrolling in education or training. Further 

 education and training, on its own, may not guarantee jobs in  the short term but long term employability would be enhanced.  Of course, education and training places need to be available  for such an approach to work.

 Important connections can be drawn between economic  management and youth policies. Australia is now at a stage  in its development process where it will have to become less  inward-directed and look out to export markets, particularly 

 to produce knowledge-intensive goods and services. We  presently maintain a comparative advantage in this area, at  least compared with our near neighbours. The Prime Minister,  last year while in Japan, had this to say about the means to 

 improve economic performance:

 "Increasingly it is recognised that an expanding,  export oriented manufacturing and service sector  provides the basic means whereby employment growth

 - 6-

 and satisfying career opportunities for our growing   population - especially for our youth - will be   p r o v i d e d " (3/2/84)

 If we wish to avoid being out-competed in the future by our   near neighbours for a wide range of goods and s e r v i c e s , we   have no choice but to do all we can to build on our current   comparative advantage. To do so requires immediate effort to   upgrade the skill level of our workforce a n d , in particular  

 of our young people who may otherwise remain unemployed and   disadvantaged in the labour market.

 So far we have been slow to adapt our youth policies   generally and our complementary income support policies in   particular to changed economic and social conditions. We   have been more concerned to provide short term palliatives  

 and ad hoc changes not necessarily consistent with broader   social and economic objectives.

 We have a choice. We can take the least-cost option which is   basically to do nothing and to leave unemployed young people   on benefit. This is the least-cost option only in the   shorter term be c a u s e , as the full-time teenage labour market  

 collapses further for structural reasons, unemployment   duration will rise and so will welfare payments. In the   longer term economic inequalities will also increase.

 The alternative, of placing income support firmly within a   wider framework of youth policies designed to enhance the   longer term employment and earnings capacity of young people,   is considerably more expensive in the short term. It will  

 necessarily involve some additional expenditure on income . -  support measures to cover those currently in need without   adequate su p p o r t . More significantly, it will involve .   increased expenditure on the quality and quantity of  

 education and training to ensure that young people wanting to   pursue more than passive forms of activity have a range of   opportunities from which to choose in accord with their   abilities and inclinations.

 There is some slack within the education sector in so far as   schools could be used after hours and we must examine ways of   increasing utilisation of existing educational resources   rather than simply adding to them. We must also explore   efficient and equitable means of recouping expenditure on   education from those who are its beneficiaries and can afford  

 to p a y . But there still remains the fundamental problem that   additional resources are required to pursue our broad   economic and social goals for young people. Given budgetary   constraints currently faced by Government, we have ahead the   difficult task of sorting out our priorities.

 CONCLUSION

 In summary the main ingredients in a reformed youth income   support structure should include the following:

 F i r s t , arrangements should be such that no young person who   wishes to participate in education or training is prevented   from doing so for financial reasons.

 S e c o n d , rates and conditions of financial support should not   discriminate in favour of any particular type or level of   education or training. In practical terms this means raising   the level of financial assistance available to eligible  

 students to at least the level of unemployment benefit.

 Third, a reformed scheme of income support should ensure that   young people in greatest need, such as those without parental   support are adequately provided for.

 F o u r t h , in th,e longer term, an incr.esse in the range of   education and training opportunites should ensure that income   support for the young unemployed is no longer required.
