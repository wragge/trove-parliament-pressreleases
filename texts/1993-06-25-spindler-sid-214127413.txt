 25 June 1993 93/273

 Australia’s Day of Shame

 The refusal by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to even consider  whether the 48 Cambodian asylum seekers should be allowed to stay on  humanitarian grounds is a shameful denial of the obligation for those in power to  apply commonly accepted standards of decency and humanity, according to the  Australian Democrats.

 "It ranks with the Government's legislation to deny natural justice and bias as  grounds of appeal against unfavourable refugee status decisions as a substantive  denial of the Convention of Civil and Political Rights which Australia has helped  sign into international law," Democrat Spokesperson for Law and Justice and Ethnic  Affairs, Senator Sid Spindler said today. '

 "The Minister is obviously wrong when he says that asylum seekers enjoy equal  rights before Australian courts - the legislation limiting grounds of appeal, bitterly  opposed by the Australian Democrats and Independents' but passed with Coalition  support, confirms that the Australian Government is prepared to deliberately create  inequality in our legal system to gain its misguided ends.

 "The Minister should welcome the avenue Mr Justice Wilcox has opened for him.and  use the discretion he has to find a humane solution for these 48 people before they  are sent back to the killing field of their war torn country," Senator Spindler  concluded.
