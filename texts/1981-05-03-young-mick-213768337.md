 PRESS RELEASE FROM MICK YOUNG, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION

 AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS jO

 "IF IT WORKS SELL IT IF IT DOESN’T GIVE IT TO THE STATES"____________

 I always thought of Mr Fraser as a shrewd politician. But I am sure  that he has just committed a political "hara-kiri" with the "Review  of Commonwealth Functions".

 Mr Fraser wants smaller Government., and he'll achieve it by making  the States bigger Governmentâ. .

 Basically, two main themes run through Fraser'  s "  last will and testament".   Firstly, sell anything that's profitable to private enterprise and   secondly whatever is difficult to manage is given to the states. Why   do we need then a Federal Government, if they wash their hands from all   responsibility.

 The area of immigration and ethnic affairs is one of the most severely   hit of all departments. The "initiatives" of Mr Fraser run to two   whole pages in the summary of the Rep o r t . Few other Departments are   dealt with in more than one p a g e .

 The translating services provided by the Department will be "sold" .to   private agencies and charges will be introduced for these services. Even the telephone interpreter service's hours of operation will be   reduced - services which have only recently been introduced to many   hospitals and put on the front cover of telephone books. Indeed the  

 accrediting authority for translation and interpreters will have to   become self supporting.

 The Commonwealth has abdicated its ^ responsibility in the area of the   Adult Migrant and Refugeee Education. It will be given to the States   and to non-government bodies. No doubt the State will be furious given   that they have no say whatsoever about the number or the selection  

 of immigrants and refugees coming to Australia. Rather than rationalising   this service this move will further confuse who is really responsible   for the teaching of english to newly arrived immigrants.

 The national groups directory perhaps the only useful document produced   by the department, which have allowed various groups to get in touch   with each other will be abolished. No doubt Mr Fraser will keep a   spare copy for the mailing list of Liberal propaganda.

 Newly arrived immigrants and refugeess will be charged for the   recognition of their professional qualifications following this Report.

 The granting of Australian citizenship, an area where there are already   delays of at least six months will be further "streamlined" as the   Report puts it.

 While the Fraser Government is committed to the recruitment "of more   and more immigrants the number of overseas based staff will be reduced   and one can cnly conclude that recruitment of immigrants will be   given also to private employers and enterprise, if profitable.
