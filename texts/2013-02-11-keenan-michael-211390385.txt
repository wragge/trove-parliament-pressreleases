 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling RECORD START TO YEAR FOR ILLEGAL  ARRIVALS CONTINUES February 11, 2013

 More people have arrived by illegal boat so far in 2013 than the start of any other year on record, as the latest illegal boat arrived with 55 people on board, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “More  than  900  people  have  arrived  since  January  1.  This  is  the  biggest  start  of  a  year  for  illegal  boats  on  record  and follows a record calendar year of boat arrivals in 2012 of 17,270 people,” Mr Morrison said.

 “Even in the middle of the dangerous monsoon season Labor’s failed border protection policies are proving an irresistible  lure for people smugglers who are continuing to send record numbers of people to Australia on illegal boats.

 “Labor’s record breaking run of failure on our borders continues and every day Julia Gillard just cements her reputation as the worst steward of our borders of any Prime Minister in our history. 

 “These record arrivals make a mockery of Labor’s recently released asylum budget update which claims they will stop the boats and slash spending by $2 billion, despite failing to implement the full suite of Coalition policies necessary to actually stop illegal arrivals,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “This latest boat arrival comes as the Department of Immigration has revealed today in Senate Estimates that  Labor  has  been  presenting  a  Budget  based  on  the  farce  that  they  have  stopped  the  boats  - despite  illegal  boat   arrivals already at record numbers this financial year.

 “The Labor Party has wasted $6.5 billion of taxpayer money trying to fix this problem of their own making.

 “This wasted money could have been spent on improving hospitals, education and relieving the burden of cost of living on families.

 “Instead  under  this  Government  the  boats  will  continue  to  come  and  the  Australian  people  will  continue  to  pay  back Labor’s debt for many years to come,” Mr Keenan said.
