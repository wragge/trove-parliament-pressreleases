  and 

  Ministfir for Justice 

  The 30th Australian Legal Convention 

  19 September 1997 

  “WORKING WITH GOVERNMENT’‘’ 

  Introduction 

  Mr Chairman, Your Honours, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. 

  Thank you for inviting me to address this the 30th Biennial Austrdian Legal 

  Convention. 

  I welcome the opportunity to address you today on the relationship of the public 

  and private sectors - working with government in relation to legal! services and 

  the legal system. 

  As a barrister fonnerly practising in the private sector and now a:, a Minister in 

  the public sector, I have lived on both sides of the fence. 

  2 

  Interdependence between the public and private sectors 

  Under a modem democratic system of government, there is a high degree of 

  natural interdependence between the public and the private sectors. 

  In the past this natural interdependence was often not recognised, as it was 

  disguised by a rigid demarcation between the two sectors. 

  What was public was public and what was private was private. 

  This demarcation was often not helpful. c 

  All Governments should aspire, in the performance of their functicins, to what 

  can be described as “the three Es”. 

  These are efficiency, that is the optimal use of public resources; effectiveness, 

  that is ensuring that the proper goals of the function are achieved; m d  equity, 

  that is ensuring fairness in terms of the achievements themselves and in the 

  manner of their achievement. 

  In recent times, and certainly under this Government, the interdepimdence 

  between the public and the private sectors to which I have referred has become 

  exposed. 

  This has led and will continue to lead to a natural blumng of the previously rigid 

  distinction between the two sectors. 

  I believe that this is a positive development, which will lead to a beneficial 

  exchange of ideas and the adoption of best practices across both sectors. 

  The Role of Government in the Legal System 

  I propose to refer to a few examples of sectoral interdependence in relation to 

  legal services and the functioning of government.

  In each of the areas to which I will refer I suggest that the degree of 

  interdependence between the two sectors can be seen to have grown in recent 

  years. 

  It can also be seen that the separation of the roles of the two sector,; in the 

  performance of government functions in the legal system has either already 

  broken down or is beginning to break down. 

  This development has, of course, substantial implications for the private 

  profession and its relationship with government. s. 

  It impacts positively on the ability of the profession to influence the direction of 

  reform of the legal system, and, conversely, on the profession’s responsibility to 

  take account of considerations above and beyond its own interests - that is, if its 

  participation in these processes is to prosper and grow. 

  Government Legal Services 

  Perhaps the most obvious roles for the Government in the legal system involve 

  protecting the Commonwealth’s own legal and related interests. 

  These include protecting the revenue, properly maintaining and sustaining 

  public resources, and promoting the legislative intentions of the Il’arliament. 

  The purchasing of legal services for these purposes provides an e ccellent 

  example of the kind of interdependence and blurring of roles between the public 

  and private sectors that I have in mind. 

  In recent years, as you know, the private legal profession has pro,vided more and 

  more legal services to Government. 

  An important development in my portfolio over the last twelve months has been 

  the decision to introduce more competition into the provision of I.egal services to 

  the Comnionwealth and to corporatise the Australian Governmer it Solicitor. 

  s u o  lFj 

  4 

  These changes are consistent with the overall approach of the Government in 

  opening up service provision Government activities to private sectci r 

  participation, wherever appropriate. 

  Earlier this year I announced that the Attorney-General’s Legal Pmctice was to 

  be restructured as a statutory authority to be known as the Australiim 

  Government Solicitor. 

  In addition, and most importantly, the Legal Practice’s monopoly cln 

  Commonwealth court litigation is to be progressively opened up to competition 

  and, with very limited exceptions, fully open to competition from I July 1998. 

  The split of the Australian Government Solicitor from the Attorney-General’s 

  Department will, as far as possible; ensure transparency and competitive 

  neutrality in the delivery of legal services to the Commonwealth. 

  Increased competition in government legal services is designed to improve their 

  quality and enable savings to be made in legal costs. _. 

  Already, most of the Commonwealth’s legal services are open to 1)rivate 

  competition. 

  About 20% of the Commonwealth’s legal work is carried out by private lawyers. 

  Much of this work is carried out jointly or in cooperation between the Australian 

  Government Solicitor and private lawyers. 

  In particular, the bar is briefed extensively by the AGS to appear jor the 

  Commonwealth. 

  However, the interaction between the AGS and the private profesljion goes 

  beyond this in some areas. 

  For example, the AGS and private legal firms have in a few cases submitted 

  joint tenders for Commonwealth legal work, including in the tender for the 

  provision of legal services in the sale of Australian National. 

  Cooperation has occurred, in some cases through joint delivery 0 1 ’  legal services 

  to complete particular projects. 

  900 IpJ 

  5 

  In these cases, the AGS might subcontract part of the job to a private firm with 

  expertise in a particular area. 

  This type of arrangement was used in Phase 1 of the sale of federal airports. 

  The AGS will continue in the future to look at using partnering mangements to 

  assist in the effective delivery of legal services to clients. 

  Other cooperative arrangements include the joint outposting of coi, insel from the 

  AGS and private f m s  to client Departments and agencies. 

  Allowing private law firms the opportunity to compete for litigation work will 

  open up, as far as is appropriate, the remainder of legal work of the 

  Commonwealth to private competition. 

  These changes came about following a review of the Attorney-General’s Legal 

  Practice whch was completed earlier ths year. 

  They follow the commitment made in the Government’s Law and. Justice Policy, 

  announced prior to the last election. 

  In particular, the Policy foreshadowed an examination of the possibilities for 

  Departments to use private legal resources for litigation. 

  rn 

  Our policy also recognised the overriding public interest in ensunng that certain 

  areas, fundamental to the operations of government, should be reserved for the 

  Government’s in-house legal adviser. 

  Cabinet, Constitutional and national security work will therefore remain tied to 

  the Government. 

  The changes now underway are being implemented consistently .with the 

  ovemding public interest in ensuring proper coordination and qu8dity in the 

  conduct of all the Commonwealth’s legal affairs. 

  This is an important part of my responsibilities as First Law 0ffii;er. 

  LOO 

  6 

  The legislation to establish the Australian Government Solicitor as a separate 

  statutory authority is currently being drafted and I hope it will be introduced in 

  the current Parliamentary sittings. 

  This legislation will also enable me to issue Legal Services Directions which 

  will provide mandatory rules to govern the delivery of legal servicw to the 

  Commonwealth, in particular, litigation services. 

  These directions will deal with a range of matters designed to protect the 

  broader Government interests that can arise in this field. 

  It has been recognised by successive governments, and indeed by the courts 

  themselves, that the Commonwealth should conduct its litigation a s  a “model 

  litigant”. 

  This places a particular onus on the Commonwealth as a party to 11 tigation to 

  conduct itself fairly and maintain the highest standards of probity. 

  It requires that the Commonwealth act expeditiously and not use ir s financial 

  strength to disadvantage other parties. 

  It requires that legal costs be kept to a minimum, for example, by not requiring 

  another party to prove a matter which the Commonwealth knows 110 be true. 

  It also requires the Commonwealth not to contest liability if the dispute is really 

  about quantum. 

  800 

  Compliance with the model litigant principle will be required by the Legal 

  Services Directions. 

  This will ensure that all Commonwealth clients and their legal adjisers, whether 

  private or government, have a legal obligation to act in accordance with the 

  highest standards. 

  It will also be necessary to ensure appropriate coordination when. whole of 

  Government interests arise in the delivery of legal services. 

  7 

  For example, litigation conducted by one Commonwealth agency can have a 

  major impact for the Government as a whole if it settles a legal issiie of general 

  application. 

  The Legal Services Directions will establish reporting mechanismsl to ensure 

  that litigation of this kind is identified and subject to appropriate coordination. 

  The Office of Legal Services Coordination has been established within my 

  Department to assist me in carrying out my First Law Officer functions and, in 

  particular, to assist me in the preparation and implementation of the Legal 

  Services Directions. 

  The Office will perform an important liaison role with the private sector, as well 

  as with Commonwealth Departments and agencies, in ensuring thzlt appropriate 

  standards are maintained. 

  I envisage that the OEice of Legal Services Coordination will conjult closely  with affected parties, including the private profession, before it m&es 

  recommendations to me on the final content of the Legal Services Directions.  * 

  The GovernmentlCitizen Relationship - Merits Review 

  Another example of the multi-faceted role of the Government in tile legal 

  system relates to the important question of the relationship betwecn the 

  Government and citizens in our democratic society. 

  A very important aspect of this involves the panoply of rnechani,cms that h 

  been created or improved over the last twenty to thirty years to piotect citizens 

  rights. 

  This falls under the rubric of administrative law. 

  It goes without saying that the private legal profession plays a fuiidamental role 

  in advising and, where appropriate, representing the citizen in 

  of these rights.

  This is an area in which we must constantly seek ways of improvin;: these 

  mechanisms, by for example making them more cost effective, accr,:ssible and 

  user friendly, and by adjustments to the private/public sector intehice. 

  The profession must play an important part in this. 

  In this regard, most of you will be aware that the Government has been moving 

  towards reform of the system under which citizens can get a decision by the 

  Commonwealth Government which effect them reviewed on their inerits, in the 

  context of the “Better Decisions” report of the Administrative Rev t ew,Council. 

  I announced, on 20 March 1997, that the Government has decided, in principle, 

  to amalgamate the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Social Security 

  Appeals Tribunal, the Veterans’ Review Board, the Immigration R,eview 

  Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal, as recommended by the 

  Administrative Review Council. 

  An interdepartmental committee is developing proposals to impler nent the  . amalgamation. 

  0 1 0  @ 

  Although the Government has not yet made final decisions about liow the 

  agreed amalgamation will be implemented, I can assure you that when details of 

  the reform of the merits review system are finally determined, the,j will in no 

  way compromise the independence of the system. 

  In general, the Government will be looking for ways in which the merits review 

  processes can be streamlined and improved. 

  We certainly want a merits review system that returns to its roots of informality 

  and accessibility - one that is, more cost effective and user friendly. 

  But the Government is committed to retaining a genuinely extern.ii1 form of 

  independent review -

  Dispute Prevention and Resolution - provision of infrastructurie 

  The Government naturally has a very substantial role to play in acliieving one of 

  the foremost aims of the legal system, namely to both prevent and resolve 

  disputes in a way that is acceptable in a civilised society. 

  The Government’s main role in this concerns the provision of infrrtstructure - a 

  term which, in this context, I use in its widest possible sense. 

  The infrastructure supporting the legal system ranges from the aprropriate 

  legislative and policy framework to the provision of physical resources. 

  Again, in more recent years Governments have increasingly recognised the 

  interdependence between the public and the private sector in designing and 

  constructing an appropriate infrastructure. 

  In particular, there has been increasing involvement by, and consultation with, 

  the private sector, and the community at large, in the variety of mexhanisms 

  established by Government to open up the policy development process to fresh 

  breezes. 

  The private legal profession naturally plays a very important role in these 

  mechanisms and the Government is particularly grateful for the v,iluable work 

  that many members of the legal profession do in giving up their time to be 

  involved in many of these mechanisms - whether it be through thi: specialist 

  sections of law societies and the Law Council of Australia, or in tlirect 

  involvement in Government advisory bodies. 

  It is no longer enough for bureaucrats or law reform bodies to develop proposals 

  for new legislation that is debated and passed by Parliament witbut substantial 

  consultation with those affected and interested. 

  The community rightly expects a much more consultative approach to the 

  formulation of the laws which affect i t .

  10 

  Not only that, but properly conducted, balanced consultation actually makes for 

  better policy and more effective legislation. 

  That consultation takes many forms. 

  You will all be familiar with the release of discussion papers dealing with 

  various refom proposals released by Ministers or government departments to 

  gauge community views prior to the development of new legislatioln. 

  Indeed my Department has recently released a discussion paper “7he Delivery 

  of Primary Dispute Resolution Services in Family Law ” on which comment is 

  invited by 28 November 1997. 

  T h ~ s  is a vitally important area in which I think we can achieve some 

  worthwhile improvements. 

  Input from the legal profession will, of course, be essential to a balanced 

  perspective. 

  The issue of copyright reform also looms large on the consultative horizon.  With the Internet putting individuals within reach of vast electronic storehouses 

  of copyright material from their homes, the community as a whole has an 

  increasing interest in the extent of copyright protection. 

  Accordingly, the Government has recently released the discussion paper, 

  “Copyright Reform and the Digital Agenda ” examining the all important issue 

  of more effective protection of copyright protection on the Internet and other 

  communications networks. 

  This is available in hardcopy and on the websites of both my Dep,xtment 

  (Window On The Law) and the Department of Communications Zind the Arts. 

  z r o  @ 

  The release of exposure drafts of proposed legislation is also a usli:ful 

  consultative mechanism. 

  C T O  

  These drafts enable a detailed examination of the proposed legislative regime to 

  ensure not only that the policy is acceptable to the community but i:hat the 

  provisions themselves are fully effective and unlikely to have unintended 

  consequences which might create difficulty. 

  These mechanisms are supplemented by the examination of a greal; deal of 

  legislation before the Parliament by multi-party Committees whicl L also invite 

  public comment and publish reports drawing on those views in orcier to 

  recommend to the Senate whether any changes need to be made.  a. 

  The legal profession has been an active participant in many of these processes 

  and has made a valuable contribution to shaping national legislation. 

  I urge it to continue this input.  In recent years there has also been an increasing tendency to creak specialist 

  advisory bodies to assist government in policy formulation. 

  Some advisory bodies are established by statute and are given a dc:fined role by 

  Parliament. 

  Others are set up on an ad hoc basis by administrative decision. 

  Members of advisory bodies are mostly part-time and are frequently appointed 

  by government on the basis of their personal capacity to contribu1,e to the work 

  of the body. 

  In such cases the members do not represent their organisations or employers. 

  This enables them to present their personal views without being answerable to 

  an external organisation or a constituency. 

  They provide independent, expert advice to government in an iiwreasingly 

  specialised and complex social environment; and open up channe:ls of 

  communication between government and the public. 

  12 

  In other cases, of course, members of advisory bodies can be specif i d l y  

  representative of particular organisations or interest groups, precise,ly because 

  the Government wants to facilitate input from them, so as to have easier access  to their views. 

  Some of the statutory advisory bodies within my portfolio are: the 

  Administrative Review Council, the Australian Law Reform Commission, the 

  Criminology Research Council and the Family Law Council. 

  Non-statutory advisory bodies include: the Bankruptcy Reform Consultative 

  Forum, the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board, the Copyrigâ¬ it Law 

  Review Committee, the Electronic Commerce Expert Group, the Federal Costs 

  Advisory Committee and the National Alternative Dispute Resolu1,ion Advisory 

  Council. 

  The work of these bodies will be known to many people here today, because 

  members of the legal profession have been prominent on a number- of them over 

  the years. 

  Advisory bodies generally complement the work of government d’1:partments by 

  extending the range of advice available to Ministers. 

  Their membership is able to offer a range of expertise, not generally available 

  within a government department so that an in-depth study requirir!.g a multi- 

  disciplinary approach can be undertaken. 

  Alternatively they can frequently provide a quick and “representa~;ive” view 

  more easily than government departments with their limited resouirces. 

  I particularly want to bring to your attention the newest advisory hody in my  portfolio. 

  In early July I announced the establishment of an Electronic Commerce Expert 

  Group to examine whether there is a need for legislation to support the 

  regulation of electronic commerce transactions. 

  It is to report to me in March next year.

  The group will consider this issue within the framework of internalional 

  standards and will report to me on the form and scope of the appropriate 

  arrangements for regulation, if any, of electronic commerce. 

  My Department is chairing the group, whose members include experts in 

  electronic commerce from business, legal, industry and governmei it sectors. 

  The group will play a pivotal role in bringing a wealth of experienlze to assist  government in shaping its legal policy response to the challenges presented by 

  electronic commerce. * 

  In developing options, the expert group have to take into account the need to 

  ensure certainty in the market place and in contract dealings and alther 

  commercial transactions, to minimise the regulatory burden on business and 

  government, and keep litigation and costs to a minimum. 

  Regard will be had to the need to resolve the legal uncertainties which are often 

  cited as an impediment to the adoption of EC, and the appropriate means of 

  updating the law to take account of technological change. 

  Any proposed legislation should be uniform and should conform with existing 

  international standards and uniform rules. 

  While on the subject of the legal problems presented by new information 

  technologies, I'd like to digress very briefly and mention one or two other 

  relevant forums in which my Department is taking a leading role in these issues. 

  A Deputy Secretary of my Department chaired an OECD group of experts 

  which prepared a set of guidelines on cryptography policy. 

  The group was set up following a joint AustraliadOECD conference in 

  February, 1996 in Canberra on 'Security, Privacy and Intellectiial Property 

  Protection in the Global Iri?formation Jnfrastructure. 

  14 

  After an intensive series of discussions in 1996 the Guidelines weri: released by 

  the OECD in March this year. 

  Further work on security and privacy protection in the global infor nation 

  infrastructure is being carried out by an OECD group chaired by the same 

  Deputy Secretary. 

  In addition, an APEC working group is examining authentication issues under 

  the leadership of an officer of my Department. 

  It would be hard to find a task that better exemplifies the desirabibity of co- 

  operation between the public and private sectors than grappling wjith the legal 

  implications of the new information technologies. 

  In an area so vital to Australian business and the economy, it is only through 

  such co-operation that we will achieve an efficient, effective and equitable 

  approach. 

  Making Better Treaties 

  Another important aspect of the legal system for which the Goveriiment is 

  responsible involves ensuring as far as possible that the public international law 

  environment is conducive to Australia’s national interests. 

  This is also an area in which the Government has “opened the wir Idows” to let in 

  fresh air. 

  As some of you may be aware, the consultative processes in the area of treaty- 

  making have been vastly transformed in recent times. 

  The Government has moved quickly to enhance participation of t!he Parliament, 

  the State and Territories and the wider community in the treaty processes.

  In a paper for a 1995 conference on ‘Treaty-Making and Australia’ - subtitled 

  ‘Globalisation and Sovereignty’ - I referred to the fact that g1obalir;ation of 

  economic activity and the need for international security arrangements render 

  Australia’s participation in the making and implementation of treaties 

  inevitable. 

  Put simply, the growing phenomenon of globalisation accentuated the need for 

  improved domestic treaty processes. 

  Prior to this Government, within Australia there was inadequate kfonnation .* and 

  consultation on treaties and the level of involvement of the Parliament was 

  minimal. 

  It was only through more accessible information, improved consul1 tation and the 

  greater involvement of the Parliament that Australia has been able to take full 

  advantage of globalisation and treaty-malung. 

  The introduction of these improvements by the Government meanis that we 

  come to the table better prepared and more able to take advantage of the benefits 

  to be gained though participation in the international process. 

  For example: 

  There are opportunities available through the World Trade Organ isation 

  accession processes to gain better market access for Australian 1e;;al services in 

  those countries seeking to become a party to the WTO. 

  Through the International Legal Services Advisory Council, chai:i-ed by Sir 

  Laurence Street, information on Australian law firms seeking access to those 

  markets is fed to those negotiating on behalf of Australia. 

  Negotiators are also informed of trade barriers in place affecting that access. 

  In the absence of the involvement of Australian law firms, an op1)ortunity for 

  them and Australia arising out of the WTO treaty process would be lost.

  16 

  Furthermore, as I noted in the paper I have referred to on the topic ofTreaties 

  and the Parliamentary Process3, given the increasing influence of treaties over 

  matters of concern to the Australian people, the previous constraints on the 

  participation of Parliament amounted to a gap in the democratic process. 

  1 will not dwell in detail on the important reforms that have been m,ade to the  involvement of Parliament in the treaty process other than to say that they 

  appear to be working well.4 

  However, I would like to draw your attention to the avenues which are available 

  to the legal profession, and the general public, for greater involvenient-in the 

  process. 

  Information on treaties and their negotiation now is much more wiljely 

  available. 

  A list of multilateral treaties under negotiation is supplied regularlyy to the States 

  and Territories and the Parliament and is published in the Department of Foreign 

  Affairs and Trade's Treaties Library at the Austlii Internet site.5 

  This list contains contact areas within Government Departments fiom which 

  more information can be obtained about those treaty negotiations. 

  A National Interest Analysis which examines the costs and benefits to Australia 

  of becoming a party to each treaty is tabled in the Parliament. 

  These NIAs and the texts of the treaties tabled in the Parliament are also 

  available to the public through the Internet site just mentioned. 

  Consultation with stakeholders on treaties is one of the key concerns of the 

  Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.

  Government Departments involved in the negotiation of a treaty sbould consult 

  the States and Territories as well as those groups with a particular interest in the 

  subject matter of the treaty. 

  They will continue to be roundly criticised by the Joint Standing Committee if 

  they don't. 

  Indeed, the Committee itself provides an opportunity for those whlo wish to have 

  a say about the treaties being considered by it to do so. 

  Finally I should note that the States and Territories have a special interest in the 

  treaty process. 

  There are a number of mechanisms in addition to the day-to-day contact 

  between Commonwealth, State and Territory authorities for involving the States 

  and Territories in the treaty process.6 

  As noted earlier, they are provided with quarterly information abciut treaty 

  negotiations . 

  Also, the Commonwealth/State Standing Committee on Treaties meets at least 

  twice a year to discuss treaty issues of concern to the States and Territories in 

  more detail. 

  Furthermore, the last meeting of the Council of Australian Governments - 

  COAG - established a Treaties Council consisting of the Prime hclinister, the 

  Premiers and the Chief Ministers. 

  The Council, which normally would meet the same time as COA113, will 

  consider treaties of particular sensitivity and importance to the States. 

  As well, State and Territory representatives are included in Australian 

  delegations involved in the negotiation of treaties and reporting 1: nder treaties.

  18 

  Indeed, other key interests groups have also been given the opportunity to be 

  involved in the negotiation of treaties. 

  For example, industry and environmental Non Government Organj sations 

  participated in the Australian delegations which negotiated some OC the more 

  recent environment conventions. 

  My purpose in raising these opportunities for information and consultation on 

  treaties is twofold. 

  The first is to let you know that they are there.  The second is to urge you to use them.  .. 

  In this way, you can assist Australia to obtain the benefits of globailisation. 

  Access to the Legal System 

  Of course, the Government also has a significant role to play in ensuring that all 

  those who need access to the system have it to the degree appropniate, regardless 

  of their means. 

  -_ 

  m 

  .. This is also an area in which the interdependence between the pukilic and the  private sectors could not be more starkly exemplified. 

  In this context, I want to talk specifically about the Government’s legal aid 

  reforms and how these will meet the community’s demands for affordable and 

  accessible justice. 

  This Government and the community share concerns that the justiice system is 

  increasingly out of the reach of many Australians. 

  People want a more accessible system. 

  They want a faster system. 

  They want a cheaper system. 

  And they want a system they can understand. 

  These concerns cannot be addressed by simply throwing more money at the 

  problems.

  The solution, or rather the matrix of solutions to these problems must closely 

  involve both the public and private sectors, including the legal prolression. 

  There needs to be much broader reform across the justice system a s  a whole. 

  There is a need, for example, to ensure that time is not wasted in litigation in 

  both criminal and civil law matters. 

  Along with ongoing reforms in the way that trial processes are managed is a 

  need for a justice system which concentrates on preventative meawres rather 

  than costly litigation. 

  There needs to be a greater commitment to innovative approaches in providing 

  assistance and the Federal Government has moved swiftly to promote 

  alternative dispute resolution services in the community. 

  In future, Commonwealth legal aid funding will be used to deliven- 

  Commonwealth stated priorities such as child representation, parenting plans 

  and injunctions relating to family violence, among other things. 

  The use of legal aid funding to meet Commonwealth stated priorillies will ensure rn  that scarce legal aid resources are used to safeguard access to just1.ce. 

  This will be achieved by a number of measures designed to maxiInise 

  accountability of legal aid funds and ensure financial discipline iri expenditure 

  of the legal aid dollar. 

  The reforms will mean more people will have access to legal aid l’or 

  Commonwealth stated priorities than a select few with costly casm 

  The reforms will encourage greater management expertise on the boards of legal 

  aid commissions who will need to demonstrate efficiency througli competition 

  with other service providers. 

  Increasingly, commissions will compete with the private profession for work 

  from both Commonwealth and State governments. 

  In making the public sector more accountable the longer term vision is to 

  promote contestability for the more efficient and equitable delivery of legal aid.

  Clearly, this is yet another area in which the distinction between this public and 

  private sectors will therefore continue to become less significant. 

  In the immediate future the focus for rationalising the legal aid doli.ar will 

  involve better case management through the early identification of expensive 

  cases and cost controls through fee ceilings for family and Commonwealth 

  criminal law matters. 

  Matters of Commonwealth priority will need to be resolved within a fund 

  ceiling. 

  Public and private service providers will need to work towards providing better 

  legal aid services at more reasonable cost, as part of the continuing quest for 

  efficiency, effectiveness and equity. 

  .- 

  In the longer term, the three Es to which I referred earlier, may drive the need 

  for greater provision of legal aid services through innovative medianisms such 

  as franchsing and tendering. 

  In this regard, I note that the South Australian Government recent:/y invited a 

  lump sum tender for legal representation of defendants in the Garibaldi trial. 

  The invitation stated that it was in the public interest that the defendants stand 

  trial at reasonable cost to the taxpayer. 

  Some commissions are already in the process of piloting and evaluating 

  franchising schemes. 

  In Britain the Legal Aid Board has now franchised nearly 2000 la,w firms to 

  deliver quality assured legal services. 

  The Legal Aid Board has earmarked extensive legal aid funds for the 

  operational expansion of franchising in 1997-98. 

  The driving force behind this expansion, as in Australia, is the identified need to 

  control costs while continuing to improve the quality of services ;wailable to the 

  community .

  Under the new legal aid arrangements between the Commonwealtli and State 

  and Territory Governments the government responsible for passing a law will be 

  responsible for administering and funding legal aid under that law. 

  As I have said the Commonwealth will be able to ensure that the funds it 

  provides are used for matters of Commonwealth priority corning lmder 

  Commonwealth law. 

  To this end the Commonwealth is pursuing better financial and st;,ttistical 

  reporting by legal aid bodies to ensure that its funds are being use11 to achieve 

  the outcomes required. 

  These combined mechanisms will lead to more cost-effective, accountable and 

  equitable delivery of legal aid to the community. 

  The Commonwealth’s focus will continue to be reasonable access to justice for 

  the disadvantaged. 

  Reasonable access, however, should not assist in cases beyond a :,tage where 

  many Austrahan taxpayers would not continue to risk their own f nancial 

  resources. 

  It must be recognised that legal aid is a service funded by Australian taxpayers. 

  Many people who are above the means test threshold for legal aicl have their 

  own access to justice constrained because of limited financial rescxtrces. 

  Just as the ordinary prudent self-funding litigant must be wary of his or her legal 

  expenses, so too must the Government be mindful of its legal aid bills. 

  Just as the ordinary person would not risk his or her funds in expemsive 

  proceedings of dubious benefit, neither will limited legal aid funds be put at risk 

  in such proceedings. 

  This is a vital reform which will address the access inequity iden.i:ified by the 

  previous distribution of extensive legal aid funds over a relatively small 

  percentage of cases.

  The Commonwealth’s reform of the legal aid system has many objectives. 

  At the forefront is the commitment to ensure that legal aid is availalile for more 

  people with legal problems coming within areas of Commonwealth priorities. 

  The reforms I have outlined today take as given that the legal profession will 

  continue working with government to ensure positive outcomes foI the legal aid 

  system. 

  They answer the community’s call for affordable and accessible justice. 

  The anticipated outcomes of the reforms to legal aid go hand in ha,nd with - the 

  broader demand which this Government is tackling for more accountable use of 

  public funds and the delivery of better quality services to the Austi:alian 

  community. 

  Conclusion 

  In closing, I think it is important to recognise that the trends to wliich I have 

  been referring are not likely to be reversed in the foreseeable future. 

  Indeed, I have no doubt that the interdependence between the puâ¬ilic and private 

  sectors, the blurring of the distinctions between them and the invtolvement of the 

  private sector in the functions of government will continue to dewlop and 

  m+ 

  increase in the future. 

  This is not something to be feared by those in either sector, but ti3 be welcomed. 

  It will bring clear benefits to all. 

  Those of us in Government will benefit from the fresh ideas andl informed 

  perspectives that the private sector brings to our deliberations. 

  In the private sector, business operations can only be improved and facilitated 

  by better policy and infrastructure. 

  23 

  Finally, to the community at large, which will benefit by the resulting increased 

  incidence of the three Es in the performance of government functions - greater 

  efficiency, heightened effectiveness and increased equity. 

  I know the private legal profession will continue to take advantage of the  opportunities that currently exist and which will open up even mor 2 in the 

  future, to interact and cooperate with Government to these ends.
