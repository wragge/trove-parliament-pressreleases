 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling Over 25,000 arrivals under the Gillard Labor  Government December 24, 2012

 The latest two boat arrivals, carrying a total of 125 people, brings the total number of illegal arrivals under the Gillard  Government to over 25,000 people, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “One of the main excuses Julia Gillard had for outing former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was his failure to protect  Australia’s borders - given that over 25,000 people on more than 400 boats have arrived under her leadership, then by  her own measure she has categorically failed to restore any control to Australia’s borders and stop the boats from coming,  Mr Keenan said.

 “This year alone over 17,000 people have arrived on our shores illegally by boat, yet Labor refuse to implement the  proven border protection policies of the former Coalition Government but instead leave our Border Protection Service to  ferry asylum boats at an unprecedented rate.    

 “The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service has been spread so thin that merchant vessels, Australian Navy  ships and Customs vessels are being used as water taxis because our patrol vessels are so overworked and rundown  that they are literally cracking under the pressure.

 “We have already seen this week what happens when you do not adequately resource the agencies responsible for  protecting our borders - it leaves them vulnerable to penetration from criminal syndicates, including people smugglers.

 “If Labor continue to slash funding and personnel from the frontline agencies tasked with the job of cleaning up the crisis  at our borders, then the situation will continue to go from bad to worse.

 “It is time this Prime Minister and the Labor Government apologized to the Australian people for the chaos they have  created at our borders and the billions of tax payer dollars they have wasted on a problem that had already been solved  when they came to power,” Mr Keenan said.
