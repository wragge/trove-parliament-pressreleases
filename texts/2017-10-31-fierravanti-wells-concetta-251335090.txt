 MINISTER FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE PACIFIC 

 SENATOR THE HON. CONCETTA FIERRAVANTI - WELLS 

 The Sydney Institute: Security and Australia in the Pacific 

 31 October 2017 

 

 E&OE… 

 

 Thank you for joining us this evening. 

 

 It’s a great pleasure to be here to address you this evening and 

 discuss the work that we do through our foreign aid program, and 

 how that contributes to the security, stability and prosperity of our 

 region.  

 

 As Minister for International Development and the Pacific, I 

 certainly have a lot of area to cover.  

 

 The Pacific, of course, is a highly strategic part of our foreign 

 policy, with this government “stepping up” our engagement with 

 our nearest neighbours. 

 

 2 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 We might have the biggest house in the street but we also have a 

 massive backyard.  

 

 The Pacific Ocean is the largest in the world and covers just over 

 165 million square kilometres and covers 30% of the earth’s 

 surface. 

 

 It is almost half of the Earth’s water surface and it is larger than all 

 the land masses put together! 

 

 Within the vastness of the Pacific Ocean there are 22 unique small 

 island countries and territories and a population of only 16 million 

 people. 

 

 Our region includes 7 of the 10 most disaster prone countries in 

 the world. 

 

 Since 2005, more than 700,000 people worldwide have been killed 

 in natural disasters and 23 million have been rendered homeless. 

 

 Now, the impact of natural disasters across our region is greater 

 because many of the Indo-Pacific countries are particularly 

 vulnerable. 

 

 3 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 In fact 85% of global deaths- for all causes- between 1980 and 

 2009 happened in the Indo-Pacific, even though its countries only 

 make up 61% of our entire population. 

 

 I have made 24 trips into the Pacific as Minister. 

 

 I have seen first-hand the many challenges that we face in helping 

 to ensure our goals of security, stability and prosperity for the 

 region are advanced.  

 

 Our Defence White Paper makes it very clear that security, 

 stability and prosperity of our region are second only to the 

 defence of Australia. 

 

 Everything we do comes back to these central goals.   

 

 Stable political and economically sound countries in our region 

 are absolutely essential for Australia’s peace and prosperity. 

 

 We spend 90% of our overseas development assistance (ODA) or 

 foreign aid in the old parlance, in the Indo-Pacific region, 

 complementing our diplomatic, trade and defence efforts. 

 

 ODA constitutes about $4 billion of DFAT’s $5 billion budget. 

 4 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 

 More than a third of Australia’s development spending is in the 

 Pacific. 

 

 Ultimately, failed states in the region will end up costing the 

 Australian taxpayer far more than the targeted and effective 

 deployment of foreign aid. 

 

 We have made a conscious decision to refocus our efforts closer to 

 home.  

 

 And tonight, I will outline why that focus is so important but also 

 how vital it is to take the Australian public with us. 

 

 It is not always easy for the public to see where all of our 

 investments go or what impact that they have.  

 

 Both the Government and the non-government sector have to 

 work hard to promote our work, both at home and abroad. 

 

 When I became Minister I started to post my activities and so I 

 used get nasty little comments about why we’re wasting money 

 overseas when we have people in need in Australia. 

 

 5 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 When I started referencing my posts to security, stability and 

 prosperity, the trolls stopped! 

 

 This of course, reflects the changing political paradigm. 

 

 Various political figures here in Australia do question why we 

 spend Australian taxpayer’s money overseas helping countries 

 when it could be better spent at home, or not spent at all.   

 

 This is my reality, especially in the Senate, and one which is likely 

 to remain for some years to come. 

 

 Now, The 2017 Lowy Institute Poll showed that 3 out of 4 

 Australians feel that the Government spends either too much or 

 about the right amount on overseas aid.   

 

 Resea



 rch conducted by the ANU shows that 80% of the aid 

 community seeks more spending on ODA compared to only 10% 

 of the broader Australian public. 

 

 But, ODA comes from hardworking Australians.  The Turnbull 

 Government is ensuring that we deliver strategically targeted aid 

 while still being fiscally responsible, because we do understand 

 the need for budget repair. 

 6 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 

 Our opponents, Labor’s overseas aid credentials are mixed at best.  

 Penny Wong lauds the British government spending on ODA aid 

 at 0.7% of gross national income (GNI). 

 

 In Australia, this would mean a spend of about $43 billion over 

 the forward estimates. 

 

 So, now for us it’s not just about what we do, but why we are 

 actually doing it,  but more importantly, what is the direct benefit 

 to Australia. 

 

 Now, The Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and 

 Development (OECD), it’s Development Assistance Committee 

 (DAC) defines what ODA covers.  A recent change in definition 

 means that certain security and in-country refugee spending can 

 also be included. 

 

 In short, you know and I’ve said this repeatedly since I’ve been 

 Minister, ODA is not charity: it is overseas development 

 assistance. It helps countries and communities to develop and to 

 help themselves. 

 

 7 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 As a middle power, we remain a consistent international donor. 

 We are the 13th largest donor in the OECD by volume. 

 

 Currently there is a wide variance in donor countries application 

 of the DAC definitions.  

 

 Now



 , we do not include spending on such things as security, like 

 the 



 United Kingdom does when it does calculate its ODA.  In 

 addi



 tion, Australia has settlement services spending which is 

 separate to our ODA. 

 

 So therefore, it is not appropriate to directly compare our level of 

 aid spending with other donors like the United Kingdom. 

 

 As I have said, 90% of our aid is spent in our region, the Indo-Pacific and a third of this is actually in the Pacific. 

 

 There are plenty of players internationally that deal with the Indo-Pacific component…of the Indo-Asia component of Indo-Pacific, 

 but the Pacific is very much our backyard. It’s the area which we 

 support most and our allies have historically looked to us to 

 continue this support of our Pacific family. 

 

 8 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 Australia’s ODA includes both bilateral and multilateral 

 contributions, including with the World Bank and the Asian 

 Development Bank.  Both will be scaling up their concessional 

 finance to the Pacific in coming years, to support opportunities. 

 

 I signed a Tripartite Commitment on Development in the Pacific 

 with the Banks last year to increase collaboration and help the 

 Bank increase its staff and operational resources in the Pacific. 

 

 We are already seeing the fruits of this collaboration - as our 

 inve



 stments scale up and the impact of those investments are 

 actually seen.  Although we engage internationally to support our 

 region, a lot of the heavy lifting still remains with us. 

 

 Of course, the United Nations and its various entities are key 

 players in the international humanitarian and aid space.  Australia 

 supports the UN system but recognises the challenges it faces and 

 the need for reform. 

 

 Accordingly, we welcome the UN Secretary General Antonio 

 Guterres’ plans to reform the United Nations to make it more 

 efficient and accountable.  

 

 9 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 Our development policy called, Australian aid: promoting 

 prosperity, reducing poverty, enhancing stability, and our Making 

 Performance Count: enhancing the accountability and 

 effectiveness of Australian aid, have introduced key shifts in our 

 ai



 d program.  

 

 These reforms have built on the work we’ve done in the past, but 

 now effectively promote economic growth and reducing poverty 

 and one that projects and protects our broader interests in the 

 Indo-Pacific region.   

 

 It is a program that has ensured a stronger focus on performance, 

 on results and above all on value-for-money. 

 

 Against this background, what we’ve done is entered into aid 

 investment plans with governments, which set out mutually agreed 

 priorities for aid programs in those countries. 

 

 I just wanted just to share some initiatives in the Pacific. 

 

 As part of our $1 billion commitment under the Paris Agreement, 

 we are actually providing practical assistance in the Pacific, $300 

 million over 4 years to deal with climate events and also disaster 

 resilience support in the Pacific. 

 10 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 

 And, what we’re doing is basically spending predominately on 

 building resilience in country and across the region. Also, as part 

 of that, on our humanitarian partnerships to prepare countries to 

 manage their risk and also both at the community levels and 

 across the region. 

 

 Over the last 5 years, Australia has Co-Chaired the Green Climate 

 Fund where we have promoted vulnerability to climate events and 

 the opportunity for climate investments. 

 

 So, with our support, we have assisted the Pacific to access the 

 Fund and champion the region. Our championing has resulted in 

 about $360 million being approved for project funding for the 

 Pacific to date, which represents about 11% of the Fund’s current 

 portfolio



 . 

 

 We have increased our humanitarian and our emergency budget to 

 ensure that the gains that the communities are making, including 

 in the Pacific, in the good times are retained, but also to help them 

 recover quickly when the hard times hit. 

 

 Globally, there is one security threat to Australians that has no 

 regard for borders - and that of course is disease. 

 11 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 

 We announced and we have given details recently of a new $300 

 million Health Security Initiative for the Indo-Pacific Region over 

 5 years. This represents the largest health and medical research 

 commitment ever made under our aid program. 

 

 Pandemics pose one of the most dangerous threats to Australians, 

 so therefore this is one of our most significant initiatives to 

 safeguard our regional security. 

 

 And, of course, with 10 million movements of Australians outside 

 of 



 Australia every year we can appreciate why disease picked up 

 overseas can easily come back to Australia. 

 

 But, of course the world has changed—and our aid program is 

 changing



  also.  

 

 M



 any developing countries today are growing rapidly, and so the 

 aid component is an increasingly smaller proportion of 

 development finance.  

 

 As I said, the purpose of our aid program is to promote our 

 national interests by contributing to sustainable economic growth 

 and poverty reduction.  

 12 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 

 Our projects contribute to economic growth, stability and 

 prosperity in these countries which in turn contributes to the 

 stability and security of our region and in turn, Australia. 

 

 It’s important that we remember the long history that we share 

 with our region and with our neighbours.  

 

 For example, later this week I will be travelling to Papua New 

 Guinea to commemorate the re-capture of Kokoda 75 years ago.  

 

 While distant theatres of war such as Gallipoli, the Somme and 

 Beersheba, as we’re seeing today, have gained prominence in the 

 Australian psyche, it is those lesser known battles like Milne Bay, 

 like the Coral Sea, like Guadalcanal that well and truly cement our 

 deep and longstanding relationships in the Pacific. 

 

 These were the battles that protected our northern front, which had 

 they been lost, would have changed our history.  They helped to 

 shape the democracy and the way of life that we enjoy today. 

 

 75 years ago during the Battle of Guadalcanal we lost Australia’s 

 largest-ever ship, HMAS Canberra when she put herself in the line 

 of fire to protect American forces- American Marines and allied 

 13 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 landings on the Solomon Islands.  She rests at the bottom of a sea 

 aptl



 y named Iron Bottom Sound.   

 

 On shore, there are memorials, but at sea, there is only a watery 

 grave.  I recently commemorated this battle off Savo Island along 

 with some veterans and the families of the 84 men who lost their 

 lives as the Canberra went down.   

 

 It was a poignant reminder as we watched the wreaths and the 84 

 crosses that had been made by Australian schoolchildren thrown 

 overboard as we watched from HMAS Success.  

 

 Our coa



 st watchers and scouts sent early warnings of Japanese 

 advances in the Pacific, which enabled Allied forces to defend 

 hard won territory.  It was wonderful when I was in Honiara to 

 meet an 110-year old former scout who had worked with 

 Austra



 lians who proudly accepted a medal in recognition of his 

 efforts. 

 

 In Nauru, I have been told I am the first Minister to tackle what’s 

 called the “bomber walk” to see the Japanese bunkers and walk 

 right up this very steep hill to see the remains of a B-52 Bomber 

 which was shot



  down on a bombing mission - most of which still 

 re



 mains at this highest point of Nauru.  

 14 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 

 Nauru and Kiribati today, they still have the Australian dollar as 

 their currencies, of course as former Australian protectorates. 

 

 These events remind us how pivotal the Pacific Islands were in 

 our shared military history and how deep those connections go.   

 

 Our neighbours suffered greatly.  We shared their suffering and 

 we still respond to their security needs. 

 

 This was most obvious when Australia led the Regional 

 Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI).   

 

 RAMSI was a wonderful example of how, under the auspices of 

 the Biketawa Declaration of 2000, the smallest and the largest 

 countries of the Pacific family came together to help the people of 

 the Solomon Islands in operation “Helpem Fren”. 

 

 Yes, we were the biggest contributor financially, but the RAMSI 

 model was built on consultation and respect and collaboration 

 between our combined military, police and diplomatic forces.   

 

 During the closing session of RAMSI, Solomon Island Prime 

 Minister Sogavare addressed me across the room and he said:  

 15 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 “RAMSI showed us that you are not just the biggest house on 

 the block…but you are a real partner, a real member of our 

 Pacific family”.  

 

 It was a touching moment, and it proved to me that these bonds 

 are crucial, they are historic, and they will ensure that we are 

 better equipped to respond in times of crisis.  

 

 When we talk about security in the Pacific today, I call it small ‘s’ 

 security. It’s not just about old challenges, but it’s about new 

 challenges like transnational crime, illegal unreported and 

 unregulated fishing, it’s about drug trafficking, it’s about irregular 

 people movements, health risks and climate related events.  

 

 La



 st month I accompanied Prime Minister Turnbull to the Pacific 

 Islands Forum Leaders’ meeting in Samoa where discussions 

 focused on maritime domain awareness, managing our oceans and 

 improving security cooperation. 

 

 We remain committed to enhancing the maritime security of our 

 Pacific neighbours.  Our Pacific Patrol Boats program has played 

 a vital role in maritime surveillance and enforcement operations, 

 such as combating illegal fishing and transnational crime. 

 

 16 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 Which is why from 2018, the Pacific Maritime Security Program 

 will build on the success of our Patrol Boat program and invest $2 

 billion in providing replacement vessels to 12 countries, along 

 with aerial surveillance capability and enhanced coordination. 

 

 The Pacific Maritime Security Program will complement the 

 efforts we are making in partnerships with organisations such as 

 the Forum Fisheries Agency and the Pacific Transnational Crime 

 Network, to strengthen regional information sharing and response 

 coordination. 

 

 The Australian Federal Police is also at the forefront of police-led 

 diplomacy.  AFP international relationships - built around 

 concerns we share with our partners on terrorism, child 

 exploitation, the flow of drugs, money and guns - are an important 

 part 



 of Australia’s broader diplomatic efforts and help to stabilise 

 and build resilience in our bilateral and our regional relationships.  

 

 With Australian support, the Pacific Transnational Crime Network 

 in particular has significantly improved understanding of the 

 emerging transnational crime in the region and delivered 

 operational successes. 

 

 17 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 This has included a recent detection and arrest of transnational 

 ATM skimming syndicate operating across the Pacific and the 

 interception of record-breaking hauls of drugs headed for 

 Australia. 

 

 Just in the last 3 months or so, 2 major hauls of over 2 tonnes of 

 drugs have been seized by French authorities in and around New 

 Caledonia. 

 

 Those drugs were headed for Australia. 

 

 Late last year, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, working with 

 the Pacific Islands Forum, reported that global criminal activity is 

 now fully integrated in the Pacific. 

 

 The sheer vastness of the Pacific Ocean makes Pacific Islands 

 countries an ideal hiding place, and ideal transit point for drug 

 runners and organised criminals that are targeting the Australian 

 market. 

 

 So, stability and security in the Pacific can only be achieved by us 

 working 



 together. 

 

 18 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 That is why at the last Pacific Islands Forum Meeting, Pacific 

 Islands leaders agreed to commence work on a new regional 

 security declaration, Biketawa Plus. 

 

 Aus



 tralia has strong interests in a more integrated approach to 

 regional security, by working with national and regional law 

 enforcement organisations to improve the region’s ability to 

 identify, evaluate and respond to specific security issues. 

 

 This includes the Pacific Islands Law Officers Network, which we 

 have supported to put in place the necessary legislative and legal 

 policy arrangements to prosecute illegal activity in the Pacific 

 

 We are working with partners to implement the Niue Treaty 

 Subsidiary Agreement, which provides the necessary legal 

 framework for strengthening cooperative fisheries surveillance 

 and enforcement capacities. 

 

 Maritime surveillance and security is crucial to our ability to fight 

 transnational crime, but also to protect vital marine resources in 

 the Pacific. 

 

 19 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 No one country and no one entity can meet the challenges of 

 maritime security and transnational crime on their own, especially 

 not in a place like the Pacific. 

 

 We support the Forum Fisheries Agencies and the Regional 

 Fisheries Surveillance Centre to collect and disseminate 

 information on fishing and vessel movements. 

 

 By assisting our Pacific Island neighbours with surveillance, we 

 are helping them to protect their fish stocks and develop their own 

 fish industries. 

 

 During my last visit to Kiribati earlier this year, I was able to see 

 the remarkable results that this surveillance work has had upon the 

 local tuna industry. 

 

 Indeed, for Kiribati with an enormous EZ, its ability to develop its 

 fishing resources and process seafood products for the export 

 market have been significantly assisted by the disruption of illegal, 

 unreporte



 d and unregulated fishing. 

 

 That’s why exchanging data on fisheries and combating illegal 

 maritime, marine and transnational crime is so important. 

 

 20 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 Currently, nations and regional organisations hold a lot of this 

 information which needs to be shared and needs to be shared more 

 extensively. 

 

 We need a better coordinated approach to collecting and using 

 information, and the goal must be for all Pacific organisations and 

 national agencies to share the information and to operate as one. 

 

 Our maritime cooperation not only helps to protect these vast 

 maritime resources, but it enhances our regional security, but more 

 importantly for us it helps to protect our own borders and our own 

 Australian community, especially those travelling in the region. 

 

 Of course, the Pacific provides unique challenges in tackling- as I 

 said 7 of the 10 most disaster prone countries are actually in our 

 region- so, climate events, natural disasters impact on security and 

 stabi



 lity. 

 

 Now, many of you would be aware of the extraordinary work that 

 goes into humanitarian responses and we saw it with Tropical 

 Cyclone Pam and Winston, respectively in Vanuatu and Fiji. 

 

 21 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 But we are doing more than responding.  We are helping our 

 neighbours to prepare for, to respond and to recover from disasters 

 themselves.   

 

 This includes the capacity building of organisations and disaster 

 management authorities, so that countries can better manage the 

 risks. 

 

 Last year, Pacific leaders endorsed the ‘Framework for Resilient 

 Development in the Pacific’, basically to strengthen regional 

 disaste



 r and risk management co-operation through a mechanism 

 that guides more coherent regional and international assistance. 

 

 There is strong evidence that upfront investment in resilience can 

 save significant costs after the disasters occur.  Every $1 that is 

 invested in preparing for a disaster actually saves $15 in response 

 and recovery costs in the aftermath of the disaster. 

 

 By investing in local disaster response capabilities, and helping 

 countries to build that resilience to the impacts of climate events, 

 we can reduce the impact for the future.   

 

 All 



 over the Pacific, National Disaster Management Offices are 

 benefitting from investments. 

 22 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 

 Also, the positioning of advisers in those offices means that we 

 can supplement that country’s ability to coordinate their response 

 efforts. 

 

 With early warning, better coordination, we can help reduce the 

 impact of disasters, and of course further assisting and maintaining 

 prosperity and security in the region. 

 

 Over the years we have not only responded to major significant 

 crises and those of course have included the extraordinary efforts 

 of our Australian Defence Forces, which have added considerably 

 to the value of our response contribution. 

 

 Just recently, we saw in Vanuatu, Manaro volcano- one of the 

 most dangerous in the world- threatened to erupt and so we helped 

 the Vanuatu Government to evacuate 11,000 residents, also with 

 delivery of food, tents and clean drinking water through HMAS 

 Choules. 

 

 Now one of the things that’s also important in the Pacific is debt 

 sustainability. This is a significant concern which threatens the 

 economic stability countries have worked hard to maintain. 

 

 23 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 Burdensome debt can divert scarce public resources from more 

 immediate needs such as health and education. 

 

 It is essential for partners and donors to work together to ensure 

 the sustainable management of existing public debt and to ensure 

 future debt is economically productive. 

 

 Now, concessional loans - such as those that are given through the 

 World Bank and the ADB - can make credit significantly more 

 aff



 ordable for Pacific Island countries, providing important 

 economic opportunities. 

 

 In addition, this affords the opportunity for the World Bank and 

 the ADB to have visibility of the existing loan books of these 

 countries and assess the viability and sustainability of repaying 

 those loans. 

 

 We all want to avoid the reputational risk of supporting programs, 

 projects or investments that fail or leave an unwanted legacy. 

 

 We support initiatives in the region that basically have 

 infrastructure which is economically productive infrastructure. In 

 other words, there’s no point building something if it’s not going 

 24 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 to give you some sort of economic value, and so therefore we very 

 much push for economically productive infrastructure to be built.   

 

 Now, one of the other important factors of our ODA is gender 

 empowerment.   

 

 At the heart of this is a goal of 80% of our aid aimed at improving 

 gender balances in government, in bureaucracies, as well as 

 helping empower women through entrepreneurship, land 

 ownership and financial security.  In 2015-16 we achieved 78% of 

 our target. 

 

 Pacific women have one of the lowest rates of formal political 

 representation in government in the world, just over 6% compared 

 to a global average of 21%. 

 

 But we know that when we empower a woman, we empower her 

 family, we empower her community, and in turn, we empower her 

 nation. 

 

 Our flagship program in the Pacific, Pacific Women Shaping 

 Pacific Development which is a 10-year $320 million initiative, 

 has given us some great results. 

 

 25 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 Everywhere I travel around the Pacific, I’ve met with women who 

 have benefitted from the assistance that we have given them. It’s 

 improved their lives, it’s improved the lives of their families and 

 we know that if we empower women we help to eliminate the high 

 levels of domestic violence which exist in the Pacific, regrettably. 

 

 The Pacific has some of the highest levels of domestic violence in 

 the world. 

 

 Of course, if we do help women, as I said, we help them to 

 contribute economically to their county and in turn to the stability 

 of their country. 

 

 Coupled with the changes of the global political paradigm there 

 have been also some significant changes in the architecture of aid 

 delivery - all of this of course is driving us and driving a need for 

 closer collabora



 tion. 

 

 The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 

 Sustainable Development Goals, the 17 goals provide a roadmap 

 for 



 development efforts and those development goals are well and 

 truly aligned with our foreign aid, security, development and trade 

 interests especially in promoting regional stability and security.  

 

 26 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 It also helps us to advocate for a greater focus on economic 

 growth and development in our region and to promote gender, 

 governance and improving tax systems issues.  

 

 Aus



 tralia is a founding member of the Pacific Islands Forum and 

 we are active and we use the Pacific Islands Forum as a political 

 framework to foster better cooperation and security in the region. 

 

 We work with other agencies, as I have mentioned, the Fisheries 

 Forum Agency (FFA), our Pacific Community (SPC) which is a 

 partnership between Australia and the Pacific community, and 

 also the Secretariat of Pacific Regional Environment Program 

 (SPREP) which is basically focused on environmental issues. 

 

 We have proven to be an effective, an integral member of the 

 Pacific family. 

 

 In that spirit of regional cooperation, we are “Stepping Up” our 

 engagement -   regional economic growth also drives regional 

 security. 

 

 We are proud of our Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic 

 Relations - PACER Plus - which we and 13 other Forum 

 members c



 oncluded in April this year.   

 27 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 

 This is a landmark trade and development agreement.  

 

 Like other FTAs, it liberalises flows in goods, services and 

 investments between the Parties - but PACER Plus is unique and 

 diffe



 rent to other trade agreements because it has development at 

 its core. 

 

 We are committed to increasing a broader trade related 

 development assistance with 20% what we term Aid for Trade in 

 recognition of the importance of fostering economic opportunities.  

 

 Our Labour Mobility Arrangements is truly a different feature and 

 an 



 important feature of PACER Plus. 

 

 At the recent Pacific Islands Forum meeting, we reaffirmed our 

 commitment to step up our engagement by signing a series of 

 MOU’s including enhanced labour mobility programs with 

 countries like Kiribati, Nauru and Tuvalu.  

 

 We also have signed some bilateral security partnerships with 

 countries and we have entered into MOUs to bolster health 

 security by providing support on supply and pricing of 

 pharmaceuticals.   

 28 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 

 We are exploring other avenues of purchasing and procurement 

 arrangements. 

 

 As I travel across the region, I am always warmly thanked- people 

 thank 



 me, they stop me and they thank me and say please thank 

 the Australian people for the transparency and the generosity of 

 our aid. 

 

 We have a good name in the region because we’ve helped our 

 friends, especially in their hour of need and most especially 

 following Tropical Cyclones Pam and Winston. 

 

 But the genuineness of our motivation to help the people of the 

 Pacific is seen most especially in the wonderful work that our 

 volunteers do.  

 

 In 



 all of our programs, as we “step up” we have been assisted by 

 an amazing army of Australian volunteers; helping to build 

 capacity in our region. 

 

 Over the next year over 900 volunteers will travel to the Indo-Pacific area to work, to train and to assist communities. 

 

 29 

 Wednesday, 1 November 2017 5:38 PM  

 So, by the end of this year, I hope to have travelled to almost 

 every Pacific Islands Forum country - some I’ve been to more 

 than 



 once as you can appreciate that makes me a very frequent 

 flyer!  

 

 I’ve racked up thousands and thousands and thousands of air 

 miles, but this experience has cemented for me the value of the 

 work that we do. 

 

 There are signs of new prosperity and security in the Pacific as 

 well as tremendous opportunities that are being afforded through 

 labour mobility and trade potential. 

 

 Through our ODA we are building our soft power in the region; 

 our closer partnerships and our greater understanding as we face 

 the global challenges together. 

 

 The Pacific is vitally important to Australia and Australia is just as 

 important to our Pacific neighbours - going back through our 

 shared 



 military history to our on-going security arrangements 

 today

 Our step-up engagement is a true validation and testament that our 

 aid is working and placing Australia as a central and valued 

 partner within our Pacific family. 

 

 Our history has shown us as we’ve worked together in the past to 

 defend our region so too we will now, working together, be able to 

 face our common security challenges. 

 

 So, can I thank you for your kind attention and for inviting me 

 here this evening.
