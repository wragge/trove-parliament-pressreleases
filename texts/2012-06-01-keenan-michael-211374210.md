 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling GOVERNMENT EXCUSES CONTINUE WITH  EVERY NEW BOAT ARRIVAL June 01, 2012

 The arrival of the first illegal boat in June follows almost 1,200 people arriving in May and has been greeted with the same tired  excuses  from  Labor,  Shadow  Minister  for  Immigration  and  Citizenship,  Scott  Morrison  and  Shadow  Minister  for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "Despite  almost  4,500  people  having  arrived  on  57  boats  in  the  last  six  months,  the  Prime  Minister  ended  another Parliamentary week refusing to bring on a vote on her Malaysia people swap legislation," Mr Morrison said. 

 "If the Prime Minister was serious about her Malaysian people swap she would have called Greens leader and coalition partner Christine Milne into her office demanding backing for her legislation as a matter of confidence. Once again she refused to do so," he said. 

 "The Malaysian people swap is nothing more than an excuse from Labor to do nothing as every boat arrives. This is a Government of excuses not action, when it comes to border protection. 

 "Rather  than  stopping  boats  with  the  proven  border  protection  policies  of  the  Coalition,  Labor  greets  them  with  more excuses," Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr Keenan said: "The arrival of the 45th boat for 2012 has seen almost 3,500 people arrive illegally by boat this year and reinforced that Labor has quite simply given up on border protection. 

 "We  are  already  on  track  to  have  another  consecutive  record  breaking  month,  with  boat  arrivals  showing  no  signs  of slowing down as the people smugglers continue to make millions off Labor’s soft border protection policies. 

 "Creating  the  crisis  at  our  borders  and  then  ignoring  it  whilst  seeking  to  blame  others  is  not  governing  - it  is  a  direct   attempt to avoid the responsibility of the Commonwealth to protect Australia’s borders. 

 "The only things that are guaranteed under this Labor Government are more boat arrivals and more budget blow outs," Mr  Keenan said.
