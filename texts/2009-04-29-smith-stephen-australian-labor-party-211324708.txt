 The Hon Stephen Smith MP  AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS 

 29 April 2009 

 Additional Humanitarian Assistance for Sri Lanka 

 Australia will commit an additional $4.5 million in humanitarian assistance for civilians  caught up in the conflict in northern Sri Lanka.  This assistance will provide urgent support  including medical supplies, shelter, water and sanitation. 

 The support will be delivered through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  ($1.5 million), the International Organization for Migration ($1.5 million), International  Committee of the Red Cross ($1.0 million) and RED R Australia, an Australian NGO which 

 supports UNICEF in the delivery of water, sanitation, and shelter ($0.5 million). 

 The $4.5 million package is additional to the $9 million in humanitarian support and food aid  Australia has allocated to Sri Lanka since December last year. 

 Australia restates its view that the safety and protection of civilians must be the absolute  priority for all sides engaged in fighting in northern Sri Lanka.   

 Australia has consistently made clear its deep concern about the humanitarian situation in  northern Sri Lanka and agrees with the Secretary General that the UN humanitarian team in  Sri Lanka should be given full access to the conflict zone to assess the full extent of the  civilian situation in the area.
