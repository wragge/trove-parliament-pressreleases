 JENNY MACKLIN 

 SPEECH TO AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE FOR HEALTH, EDUCATION 

 & DEVELOPMENT ABROAD (APHEDA) ANNUAL DINNER 

 

 21 SEPTEMBER 2005 

 E&OE; CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY 

 

 1 

 Thank you for that introduction.   

 It's a very great pleasure to be here tonight.   

 It’s been 21 years since “Australian People for Health, Education and 

 Development Abroad” - APHEDA - was created as the overseas aid 

 agency of the Australian Council of Trade Unions.  APHEDA was - and 

 still is - unions and unionists helping working men and women who are 

 denied industrial and civil rights and suffering poverty, unemployment, 

 violence and war.  

 It is ironic that we celebrate twenty one years of APHEDA at a time when 

 the rights of working people here in Australia are under such savage 

 attack.  John Howard’s workplace changes will strip awards, trash unfair 

 dismissal protection, take away the powers of the independent Industrial 

 Relations Commission and keep unions out of workplaces.  

 These blows to workplace rights are staggering.  When they seem 

 overwhelming, we should think of the work of APHEDA.  I think of 

 APHEDA’s projects assisting refugees on the Thai-Burma border, people 

 fleeing a regime where trade unions are suppressed, and forced labour, 

 slave labour and child labour is common.  Here in Australia, we can still 

 speak, protest, rally and vote without fear of retribution.  And I encourage 

 all of you to do just that, to join and support the ACTU campaign to 

 protect your rights at work.      

 I also encourage you to support working men and women around the 

 world who face truly overwhelming odds in their struggle for dignity in 

 work and in life.  APHEDA stands side by side with these people, thanks 

 to your support.

 APHEDA does some fantastic work around the world.  Tonight, the focus 

 is on East Timor - Timor Leste. Timor Leste is one of the countries 

 around the world where APHEDA works with local communities to build 

 their economic security and strength.   

 Wherever APHEDA stretches out the hand of solidarity to the working 

 men and women of the world, I know you are guided by the values that 

 we all here tonight share.   

 We know that real aid is not charity, doled out by a munificent west to an 

 ever-grateful Third World.  We know that aid is justice and partnership, 

 and its aim is self-reliance.  

 Partnership between nations, partnership between communities and 

 organisations, partnership between people.   When it comes to 

 international aid, at its fundamental level, governments are really only 

 intermediaries: mechanisms through which the people of one country 

 reach out to help the people of another.  

 Labor welcomes the government’s recent announcement of an increase to 

 the aid budget.  But the announced increase still leaves Australia falling 

 well short of the contribution made by most other developed nations.  

 And remember this government’s record of mean and tricky sleights of 

 hand with the aid budget - using the aid budget to pay for the cost of 

 keeping asylum seekers on Nauru comes to mind.  

 Labor believes that the government should commit, as circumstances 

 permit, to achieving 0.5 per cent of Gross National Income for 

 development assistance.  This is what most other developed countries do, 

 and Australia should do no less.

 Tonight, as we sit down to our meal, more than a billion people in the 

 world are living in extreme poverty.  Extreme poverty is an economic 

 term - it means living on less than one dollar a day. But ‘extreme 

 poverty’ also has a less technical meaning. Our billion brothers and 

 sisters who live in extreme poverty are hungry - all the time.  They have 

 no health care, no sanitation, no clean drinking water. Many have no roof, 

 no shoes, no bed, no blanket.  Forget about school for their children.  

 Extreme poverty kills 8 million people each year.  Twenty thousand 

 people died today because they were poor.  They died in hospitals that 

 have no medicines, in beds that have no mosquito nets, in houses with no 

 clean drinking water.  They died because ten years of starvation left them 

 unable to get over a common cold. They died of preventable illnesses like 

 measles or of treatable illnesses like gastroenteritis.  Many died of AIDS.  

 These people do not need the leaders of wealthy nations to lecture their 

 governments about free trade and the open market.  They do not need 

 those same leaders to lecture the UN about bureaucratic inefficiency and 

 waste.  Yet that is what we have seen from John Howard in this past 

 week.   

 John Howard, who presided over Kids-Not-Overboard.  John Howard, 

 whose election-year tactic is to fling a bucket of cash at every marginal 

 seat he can find.  John Howard, whose government has spent almost a 

 billion dollars of taxpayer’s money on campaign advertising since 1996.  

 John Howard, whose Ministerial Code of Conduct was recently sighted 

 on EBAY advertised as “Mint Condition - never used.”  You would think 

 he’d have choked on his words in New York last week when he started 

 talking about good governance as a precondition for continued aid!  

 4 

 But that is John Howard’s record on international affairs - and on 

 domestic affairs as well!  He has always put his own ideological 

 obsessions ahead of everything.  His government will destroy student 

 services because they’re provided by an organisation called a ‘union’.  

 The Howard Government poured nineteen million dollars into the Cole 

 Royal Commission witch-hunt against construction unions.  They’re 

 flogging off Telstra against overwhelming community opposition.  This 

 government has starved public health and public education of funding 

 while pouring tax dollars into the private system because of their 

 obsession with private provision of every service, no matter how 

 inappropriate.  

 We see the same approach from John Howard as he talks down the UN 

 and undermines the multilateral Millennium Goals in New York.       

 Labor knows that partnership through multilateral organisations such as 

 the UN is essential.  Global cooperation is required to tackle global 

 problems.  

 We know as well that economic development can't be built on economic 

 exploitation.   We know that civil and political rights can't flourish 

 without labour and industrial rights.  And as the quagmire in Iraq shows, 

 democracy can only flourish as a native plant in each nation.  

 That’s why organisations like APHEDA are so important.  APHEDA's 

 work in community building and capacity building tills the soil for 

 democracy to flourish.  

 For example, in Timor Leste, APHEDA - of course - supports trade 

 unions developing industrial standards and negotiating rights.  But 

 5 

 APHEDA also supports community radio, overcoming literacy issues to 

 communicate news and current affairs to the people of Timor Leste  in 

 their own language of Tetum.  

 Timor Leste has an NGO forum called FONGTIL, which is an 

 association of over 270 human rights, environmental and development 

 organisations.  APHEDA supported FONGTIL in its District Outreach 

 program from November 2001 to November 2004. This program 

 coordinated meetings throughout Timor Leste’s districts, with the 

 information gathered through these meetings conveyed to Dili. This vital 

 bridge between Dili and the districts helped a broad range of national and 

 international organisations work with communities throughout Timor 

 Leste rather than judging the country’s needs from the capital only.   

 The APHEDA-supported Knua Buka Hatene Vocational Training Centre 

 has trained 3,554 people in skills like carpentry, literacy, civic education 

 and plough making. And I'm delighted that 65% of trainees are women, 

 which is particularly important since almost two thirds of adult women in 

 Timor Leste have never attended any school. The training centre also 

 trains trainers, and 55% of those are women.   

 And this is what you would expect from APHEDA, from a union-centred 

 and union-founded organisation.  Unionists know the conditions and 

 security of the working people at the bottom of the ladder and 

 fundamental to the health of any economy.  And we know that in most 

 economies, women take the brunt of insecurity and uncertainty.  No 

 economy and no society can thrive unless the most disadvantaged have 

 basic economic independence and dignity.  

 6 

 One more thing about the Knua Buka Hatene Centre.  It has become a 

 venue for events and forums that build the civil society of Timor LestÃ© - 

 forums on 'truth and reconciliation', national constitution, land reform, 

 women's development, environment and media regulations.   

 We see at KBH the twin imperatives of a strong community, hand in 

 hand: economic and working rights go with civil and political rights.   

 These imperatives are, and have to be, close to the heart of the labour 

 movement and the Labor Party.  We were founded by those seeking 

 dignity and fairness in work.  We have always understood that civil 

 society and individual liberty can only exist in a nation that affords its 

 citizens the means to live with decency and security.   

 And the Labor Party understands that there is a broader security agenda in 

 international aid.  We know there is no national security in pulling up the 

 drawbridge on Fortress Australia while invading other countries. National 

 and international security depends on fostering democracy around the 

 world, not foisting ideology on other nations at the point of a gun.   

 For all these reasons, APHEDA reaches out to our working brothers and 

 sisters around the world.  Your support makes their work possible.  And I 

 know that you will continue to support APHEDA, and through 

 APHEDA, our friends and our neighbours everywhere.  

 Because as working men and women have always known, we stand tall, 

 when we stand together.
