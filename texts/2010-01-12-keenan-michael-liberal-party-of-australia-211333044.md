 RUDD GOVERNMENT CONFESSES TO NATIONAL SECURITY BREACH 

 Mr Michael Keenan MP  

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs 

 Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans admitted the Government chartered an aircraft to 

 knowingly bring four asylum seekers deemed to be a threat to national security from Indonesia to Australia.  

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs Michael Keenan said this is an outrageous breach of national security.  

 “It is the Government’s responsibility to protect our borders - not only have they failed to protect our borders, they 

 knowingly brought people deemed to be a national security threat from a third country into Australia,” said Mr 

 Keenan.  

 “They have betrayed the trust of the Australian people, and threatened the integrity of our border protection 

 system.”  

 “The Rudd Government must explain why they would act in such a reckless manner with regard to a national 

 security matter.”
