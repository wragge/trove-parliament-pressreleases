  ASIO’S ANNUAL REPORT 

  The need to prevent terrorism at the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games   was the main focus of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation’s work in   1999-2000.   ASIO’s close work with other Commonwealth agencies, New South Wales Police and 

  overseas liaison partners to forewarn of potential threats helped to ensure the safety   and security of the Games, making them the best ever.   ASIO’s annual report, tabled in the Parliament today, shows AS10 was also required   to respond to several emerging national security trends in 1999-2000. 

  One issue was the significant increase in illegal arrivals requiring security   assessments.   Another issue was ASIO’s close work with other Commonwealth agencies on   strategies to protect the National Information Infrastructure. The NII is the national 

  electronic network telecommunications, banking and finance, transport and   distribution, energy and utilities, information services and other critical government   services, including defence and emergency services, within which information is   stored, processed and transported. AS10 assessed the threat to specific Government   computer systems and issued security intelligence reports on computer attack trends.   The 2000-20011 Budget included an extra $2 million to Further address protection of   the NII, including $600,000 to ASK). 

  The annual report shows that, excluding illegal arrivals and Olympicspecific work,   ASIO’s security checking for visa is,sue and permanent residence increased by 37 per   cent on the previous year. On AS10 advice, three visa applicants were refused entry   to Australia on espionage or foreign interference grounds, and a fourth applicant on 

  grounds relating to politically motivated violence..   AS10 issued 12,471 personnel security assessments for people who require access to   national security classified material or secure places - a 9.5 percent increase on the   previous year. 

  It made l,346 threat assessments relating to the likelihood of politically motivated   violence - a 52 per cent increase. About 25 per cent of the threat assessments related   to the Olympics.   Now that the Sydney 2000 Games are over, AS10 will focus on preparations for the 

  security of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Brisbane next year.   ASIO’s annual report will be available on its website at: www.asio.gov.au.
