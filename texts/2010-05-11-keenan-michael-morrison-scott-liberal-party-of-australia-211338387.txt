 Border blowouts to blow Budget as two more boats arrive

 11/05/10

 The arrival of two more boats today will contribute to further blowouts in budgeted spending for offshore detention in 2009/10, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “The blow out on our borders will blow a hole in this year’s budget and those that follow,” Mr Morrison said.

 “Already the Government has had to ask for an additional $130 million this year, on top of the $125 million originally budgeted for offshore processing on Christmas Island,” he said.

 “These additional funds were required to meet the increased demand, with a revised estimate of 1,400 arrivals, caused by the failure of their border protection and immigration policies.

 “We have now had more than three times that number of people arrive. In 2009/10 there have been 98 illegal boat arrivals carrying 4,585 people.

 “As a result we expect to see further blow outs in the costs for the current year and across the forward estimates in the hundreds of millions of dollars, when the budget figures are released on Tuesday night.

 “In addition to the cost blow outs on Christmas Island, the costs for onshore detention are also expected to increase, as detainees are moved off Christmas Island to detention centres and motels around the country.

 “Incredibly the Rudd Government projected savings in onshore detention costs of more than $25 million back in February. Now with the increase in the onshore detention population and the reopening of the Curtin Detention Centre these costs will spiral upwards,” he said.

 Mr Keenan said: “Tomorrow the government will announce hundreds of millions of dollars in additional funding for border protection, every dollar of which will be wasted unless they address the heart of this problem.

 “Increasing funding to Border Protection Command will only increase the quality of the taxi service this government is operating for people smugglers.

 “If the Rudd Government wants to stop the boats from coming it needs to fix its broken policy, not throw more money at it,” he said.
