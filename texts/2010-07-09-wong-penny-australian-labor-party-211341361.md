 Senator the Hon. Penny Wong  Minister for Climate Change, Energy  Efficiency and Water  Doorstop interview: Green Loans, Green Start, asylum  seekers, climate change policy 

 

 Adelaide  9 July 2010  PW 151/10  

 WONG: Thanks very much for being here. It’s great to be here to launch the Adelaide Solar  City Key Link Industrial Estate Project, one of eight projects under the Solar City Program  here in Adelaide, a great example of the way in which businesses can do their bit for the  climate. They can do their bit to reduce their energy use, to increase their use of clean energy  and to reduce their use of water. These are really important projects. 

 One of the last pieces of legislation we passed through the parliament in the last session was  the Renewable Energy Target. That will increase by four times the amount of renewable  energy we use in this country. That will drive investment into the big projects as well as well  as to household projects. We also need action from the ground up, not just from action from  the top down but action from the ground up. And here today we are seeing what a responsible  business with a range of partners can do to do their bit for the climate. So I congratulate all  those involved in this. This is a great project and I am very pleased to be here to announce it 

 and happy to take questions. 

 JOURNALIST: Senator speaking of green initiatives, the disaster of the Green Loans, is it  time now for Peter Garrett to go? 

 WONG: Oh look, Peter Garrett did what he had should have done which was to act on  concerns. One of the reports I released yesterday, was one of the reports that Peter Garrett  initiated because of his concerns about the program, so he did the right thing. Yesterday what  I did was what I said I would do, that is to act on the problems that have been identified in the  reports. I released a new design of the program that took into account the findings of the  report. We knew that there were problems and we acted on them. 

 JOURNALIST: But did you, that didn’t quite answer the question, does he have your  confidence? 

 WONG: Absolutely and I think there many aspects of the report where you see that Peter  was regrettably not briefed when he should have been about these issues. 

 JOURNALIST: But he is the Minister responsible surely? 

 WONG: And he acted in accordance with the advice given to him. He also acted to ensure  that he initiated these reports to find out what was going wrong. That’s enabled me to do  what I have had to do to improve the program. We’re phasing it out and we’re going to have  a new program, a Green Start Program, which will be delivered more robustly, that’s taken  into account the findings of these reports. 

 JOURNALIST: But even so we are talking about a waste of money and talking about a new  program that is superseding the old one. 

 WONG: Well Mike... 

 JOURNALIST: Surely that must mean that there was a flaw with the old one or it wasn’t  properly run and that goes back to the Minister. 

 WONG: Well Mike, I don’t think anybody in this Government is hiding the fact there were  problems with these programs. We have been absolutely transparent, when I took over this  program in March of this year I gave a statement to the Senate where I said there are  problems here. I laid out what we would do in relation to those problems. We fixed a number 

 of them, I also said I would wait for these reports to be finalised. When I took over this  program in March I gave a statement to the Senate, where I made clear the problems, we’ve  done a range of things to fix some of those problems. I also said that when these reports were  provided we would look at them and we would act. And that’s what we’ve done. 

 JOURNALIST: You don’t deny there are problems, you say the Minister wasn’t briefed  properly so is it the Department’s fault then should other people get the sack? 

 WONG: In terms of the reports they speak for themselves and they identify a range of  problems, I don’t shy away from those. In fact I have looked at them very carefully and have  taken that into account and the re-design that I have announced yesterday. We will also 

 consult with stakeholders on the final guidelines and the final details of those programmes  because we do want to make sure we listen to their views about these issues. In terms of any  investigation as I have said today and yesterday I am not in a position to give any information  about any current or future investigations because that might prejudice the outcome but the  Department has made certain statements about this and I refer you to that. 

 JOURNALIST: So this isn’t an embarrassment to the Government? 

 WONG: This is a set of problems that we have moved to address, and we have done what I  said would do which is to face up to the problems, look at them carefully to fix them and in  this case, to change the way this program is delivered, because we understand what problems  there have been. 

 JOURNALIST: Still with Peter Garrett, in that portfolio? 

 WONG: Well actually I have responsibility for this program now... 

 JOURNALIST: His portfolio... 

 WONG: Well actually I have responsibility for this program now that’s why I made the  announcement yesterday. 

 JOURNALIST: In the run up to the election, one that is going be centred around more than  ever, the environment, the Government’s performance over the past couple of years on  environment issues have been somewhat lacking. Are you expecting there will be a bigger  than ever swing to voters towards the Greens? 

 WONG: I know this will be a hard fought election and I know that it will also be a choice  between Julia Gillard who understands that climate change is real and wants to do something  about it and understands we need to reduce our pollution, and Tony Abbott who seems to  believe as recently as yesterday that carbon dioxide isn’t a problem. That will be the choice  that voters face. We were elected with a very large agenda. And we would, I’d acknowledge  that there have been some setbacks in relation to that. 

 Let’s remember what we have achieved. This Government has put more solar panels on roofs  than any Government in Australian history. We supported more Australians getting solar hot  water. We passed legislation through the Australian Senate which will ensure we quadruple,  we increase by four times the amount of renewable energy like the sort you see today and we  are supporting these sorts of projects on the ground so that good companies can do their bit  for the environment. These are important achievements and they are achievements which  were never in place under the previous government. In relation to the problems, where there 

 have been problems, we’ve been absolutely upfront and yesterday I was very transparent  about those problems. We released all three reports. We’ve tabled them in the Senate because  I wanted to be very clear with the Australian people and the Parliament about the problems  that were in the program and what we were doing to fix them. 

 JOURNALIST: Senator, what in your view, in your personal view, what’s the most humane  way, in your view of dealing with asylum seekers? 

 WONG: Look, I think Julia Gillard has made a very clear point, one that I hope Australians  will listen to which is this, that we have to remove the incentive for people to travel. She’s  also articulated, I think, very clearly that Tony Abbott’s response on this is nothing more than  a hollow slogan. 

 JOURNALIST: What’s your view? 

 WONG: My view is Julia’s view. That we should ensure we remove the incentive to travel. I  think exploring with other countries, a regional processing centre that is endorsed by the  UNHCR is a sensible way to go because it does remove the incentive to travel. It is not in  anybody’s interests for there to be an incentive for people to get on leaky boats. But this is  not a debate that is furthered by the sort of rhetoric that we see from Mr. Abbott. He’s not  telling the truth on this issue and he should be held to account for the fact he is not telling the  truth. 

 JOURNALIST: (inaudible) 

 WONG: (laughs) We can do an interview later if you want another time. 

 JOURNALIST: Ms. Gillard hasn’t been clear about where these people will be taken. She  was saying East Timor, now she’s denying it. 

 WONG: Look, I think I’d say to people go back to the speech. It was quite clear she was  saying this is what we would like to do. She made very clear this is not a short term fix. This  is a long term proposition. And she said she’d be in dialogue with various countries in the  region about how we would approach this. Building on the work that’s already been done. So  I think, I’d remind people what she actually said. 

 JOURNALIST: But why then would she single out East Timor for a mention in the speech? 

 WONG: Well as I said, go back to what the Prime Minister said. She was very clear in her  speech about the status of these discussions. And she was upfront that there was no short-term quick fix to this which is where Tony Abbott is not being upfront with the Australian  people. 

 JOURNALIST: So you don’t think she’s shown any sort of Prime Ministerial naivetÃ© in the  way she’s dealt with this, handled this? Not jumped the gun? 

 WONG: No, absolutely not. I think the Prime Minister has spoken the truth about the  difficulty of this problem. She’s spoken the truth about the way in which the Opposition is  approaching it. She’s been upfront with the Australian people that there isn’t a quick fix. And  she’s laid out a range of strategies to deal with it. 

 JOURNALIST: (inaudible) Are we still on track for 21/28 August? 

 WONG: I’m sorry? 

 JOURNALIST: Are we still on track for a 21/28 August? 

 WONG: (laughs) I think you’d better ask someone else that. 

 JOURNALIST: She’s expected to release the new climate change policy over the next few  days. How much of a role have you had in developing it? 

 WONG: Well I’m the Minister for Climate Change so obviously I have a role in climate  change policy. I’m not going to engage in this sort of speculation we’ve seen in the media,  I’ll just say this. We understand that if you want to deal with climate change, you have to  reduce pollution. And our policies will be about reducing pollution. We have to use less  energy and we’ve got to use more clean energy and we’ll be focussed on that. 

 JOURNALIST: Senator, one more quick question on asylum seekers. There was a letter in  The Australian today. I can’t remember the name of the gentleman but he was reasonably  recently arrived in Australia as an immigrant. The rhetoric that Julia Gillard has used in the  last few days, at the very least, do you think that it may show some confusion to the  electorate that she doesn’t know what she’s doing? 

 WONG: No I don’t. 

 JOURNALIST: That she’s not making policy on the run? 

 WONG: I don’t agree the premise of the question. And I again say this. Julia Gillard, the  Prime Minister has been upfront with the Australian people about this problem. She said, 

 what we have to do is look at a long term, sustainable solution that removes the incentive for  people to travel. She’s also made clear the reasons why Tony Abbott’s slogans on this are  nothing more than words. 

 JOURNALIST: But East Timor hasn’t been co-operating with this? 

 WONG: I think that there’s been a lot written about this. There’s also been a lot discussed  obviously between Australia and East Timor, as the Prime Minister said. This is something  we will be discussing with parties in our region, she’s been upfront about that. 

 JOURNALIST: What other solutions is she looking for? 

 WONG: Well I’d refer you back to the Prime Minister’s speech. 

 JOURNALIST: Would you rule out an interim carbon price before 2012? 

 WONG: I think the Prime Minister on television recently made clear that the position in  terms of the deferral of the CPRS stands. But obviously we have more to say about climate  change policy. We will be focussed on how we ensure this country moves towards a low  pollution economy. We reduce our pollution over the years. That’s what we need to do. 

 JOURNALIST: So will there be an interim price? 

 WONG: As I said, I’m not going to engage in speculation but I’d refer you to what the Prime  Minister said. She made clear on television recently that the position in relation to the deferral  of the CPRS stands. 

 JOURNALIST: Just one more question, are you considering stricter rules for new power  stations? 

 WONG: I’m not going to engage in any speculation about Labor’s climate policies. Again,  what I say is unlike Tony Abbott, we recognise climate change is real. We don’t think carbon  dioxide isn’t a problem. We don’t think it’s okay to simply increase pollution. And we’ll  focus on that.
