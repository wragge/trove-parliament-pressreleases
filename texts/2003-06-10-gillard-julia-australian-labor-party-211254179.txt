 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 Minister Ruddock  

 Bends under pressure but needs to bend further   

 I welcome Minister Ruddock’s belated decision to grant visas to some 397 East Timorese  people living in Australia, but it does not go far enough.   

 I am in Darwin today, a city that is home to a substantial community of East Timorese people  who have lived in fear of being forcibly returned to East Timor.    

 Given Minister Ruddock has made highly negative references to these people in the past,  including accusing them of ‘having secreted themselves in the community’, I welcome the  decision, although it is long overdue.    

 In Parliament last week, the Minister stated that the majority of the representations he  received on behalf of the East Timorese were from Labor Members of Parliament.  Labor  believes that without this pressure and strong advocacy from the Northern Territory and  Victorian Governments and many community groups, the Minister may not have granted  these visas.   

 While the granting of these visas is a great relief for 397 East Timorese people, the fate of  more than 1,000 other East Timorese applicants remains unknown.  These people continue to  live in fear and uncertainty, not knowing if they will be required to leave Australia.   

 Labor will continue to press to have its amendment to the Migration Act adopted to enable the  creation of a special visa class for the East Timorese. Such a course is not only the most  compassionate, it is the most cost effective to the Australian taxpayer sparing the cost of each  claim being separately processed by the Department of Immigration, the Refugee Review  Tribunal and the Minister for Immigration.     

 Once again, I call on the Government to join me in passing Labor’s amendment.      

 It is no surprise Minister Ruddock’s sudden and unexpected rush of compassion came at a  time when he was under pressure from Labor about the ‘cash for visas’ scandal.  Minister  Ruddock would have looked absurd if he had not engaged in an act of generosity to the East  Timorese, given the public exposure of dubious cases in which visas have been granted.
