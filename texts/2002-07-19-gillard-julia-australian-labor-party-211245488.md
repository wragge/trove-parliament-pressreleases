 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 BAKHTIYARI BOYS PROVE WOOMERA IS NO PLACE FOR CHILDREN

 Today, Minister Ruddock is publicly claiming that Mr Bakhtiyari, the father of the boys who sought asylum at the British Consulate in Melbourne yesterday, does not have a valid refugee claim.  In making this claim, Minister Ruddock is seeking to disguise the true issue.

 The real issue is not the merits of Mr Bakhtiyari’s claim for refugee status, but how Alandad and Matazir been treated in Australia.  These boys, who are only 12 and 13, have been held in the Woomera detention centre and witnessed riots, suicides, hunger strikes and other forms of self harm.  Indeed, the boys have been so disturbed by their experiences they have resorted to hunger striking and self harm themselves.

 Whatever view one holds about the appropriate way of dealing with asylum seekers, children are the innocent ones swept up in a situation beyond their control.  All children have a right to a proper education, love, security and a happy childhood.

 Since January this year, Labor has been calling on the Howard Government to get the children out from behind the razor wire by: â¢ Putting unaccompanied minors into foster care; and â¢ By building on the current alternate detention trial in which women and children

 are living in ordinary style housing under supervision.  Labor believes this model could be used for housing family groups and that children living in such arrangements could go to ordinary schools.

 Labor also renews its call for the closure of Woomera.  No-one should be held in such a facility, especially when the much better $40 million Baxter facility lies idle.

 The Howard Government’s refusal to get the children out and to close Woomera is driven by belligerence and political game playing.  Children should not suffer because the Howard Government prefers belligerence and playing politics with asylum seeker issues, to finding long term comprehensive solutions.
