 JOINT TRANSCRIPT   THE HON JOE HOCKEY MP  SHADOW TREASURER    

 THE HON ANDREW ROBB MP 

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR FINANCE, DEREGULATION   AND DEBT REDUCTION    

 

 PRESS CONFERENCE  MELBOURNE  TUESDAY, 13 AUGUST 2013 

 

 E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………    

 JOE HOCKEY    

 I am here with Andrew Robb to provide some comment in relation to PEFO for 2013. There  are a number of revelations, and there are a number of confirmations in relation to this  document. The first revelation is that barely a month ago, Kevin Rudd said to the Australian  people that the carbon tax has been terminated. The fact is that the terminator is alive and  well. The carbon tax in just eleven days has increased by nearly a quarter of a billion dollars  in revenue. This is a further slug on families, and a further slug on business.     

 The Government is still forecasting that the carbon tax will rise to $38 a tonne. It illustrates  the volatility associated with the carbon tax. The fact that in eleven days the revenue assumed  from the carbon tax is increasing by nearly a quarter of a billion dollars proves that Kevin  Rudd did not tell the truth to the Australian people when he said that the carbon tax had been  terminated.     

 Secondly, it is now clear that the cost of Labor’s failed border protection policies will amount  to around $15 billion. This is an extraordinary revelation. The fact that the Treasury and the  Department of Finance have gone to significant lengths to try and quantify the risk scenarios  associated with the failed border protection policy says everything about the inherent risks in  the Budget.     

 The third key revelation is that there is significant commentary in the document about the  downside risks to the Budget. These need to be carefully considered by the Coalition. The  downside risks are exceptional. As the PEFO identifies in page two, the crisis in the Euro  area remains unresolved; markets are anxious about the unwinding of US monetary policy; 

 there is lingering uncertainty about the sustainability of Japan’s recovery; and markets are  concerned about financial developments in China.     

 These are some of the risks; but overwhelmingly, the greatest risk is obviously the re-election  of a bad Labor Government. There have also been a number of confirmations in this  document: growth will be slower under Labor; unemployment will be higher under Labor;  unemployment is expected to go towards 800,000 Australians without a job; unemployment  is expected to grow to 6.25% by the middle of next year.     

 Secondly, and in stark terms, the nation’s credit card limit has been exposed as being broken  by Christmas. The fact of the matter is, page sixteen of PEFO in the second last paragraph,  identifies that the debt limit will need to be increased before the end of this year, as the  Government’s debt increases beyond the $300 billion limit that Labor last legislated through  the Parliament. This means that debt will rise to $370 billion - heading towards $400 billion  - within 3 years.     

 The third major confirmation is that the deterioration in the Budget bottom line has been  confirmed. But, as I say, there is significant commentary about the downside risks associated  with the current Budget forecasts. The fact of the matter is that it is only the Coalition that is  going to repair the Budget. It is only the Coalition that is going to get the economy back on  track.     

 We will carefully consider a lot of the detail in this document. The fact that the carbon tax  has increased by nearly a quarter of a billion dollars in eleven days. The mining tax has  increased by an estimated $400 million in just eleven days, despite that fact that Rio Tinto  and Yancoal actually got refunds on the mining tax as announced by them recently. There is  also tremendous uncertainty and a lack of clarity in PEFO about $1.2 billion of education  funding associated with Gonski. It remains unclear whether Western Australia, Queensland,  and the Northern Territory are going to be penalised to the tune of $1.2 billion for not signing  up with the Government to the Gonski plan, by the time the election was called. That is a  significant potential hole in the PEFO document. I will ask Andrew Robb to say a few words  about this and a few other issues, and then we will come to questions.    

 ANDREW ROBB:    

 Well thanks very much Joe, I would just like to add two points: one about business and  consumer confidence, and the second one about costings of Labor policies. Firstly, on the  question of business and consumer confidence, clearly the Budget emergency that has been  confirmed in this Treasury statement today will simply compound the collapse that we have  seen in recent weeks of business and consumer confidence. If you look today at the National  Australia [Bank] Monthly Business Survey, what they have shown is that business conditions  remain at a four year low, while confidence has slumped to an eight month low in the last  four weeks. That is despite the dollar falling off by some 15%, and despite the lower interest  rates. We are seeing business confidence collapsing further from what were already low  levels. In a similar way, if you look at the Roy Morgan consumer confidence, last week they  took a sounding after the Economic Statement that was put out some ten days ago, and they  found that consumer confidence has plunged to its lowest level in 12 months. So we have got  both consumer and business confidence collapsing, and it is little wonder, with other things  such as the irresponsible and negative comments of Mr Rudd that the mining boom is over,  with an emergency Budget confirmed, with blow-outs in debt to well over $300 billion, with  the $3 billion a week collapse the Budget bottom line - all of these things are eating away 

 dramatically at business and consumer confidence. And it is adding further to the six years of  uncertainty and chaos and poison within the ranks of the Labor Party and the lack of direction  and the instability. All of these things are front of mind of people who just want to get on  with their lives but at the moment are fearful. That is why they are saving so much money.  They are paying off the plastic, the mortgage; they are not spending. That is why retail is on  its knees and so is business confidence; they are not investing. That means that there is no  growth. Growth is now going back to quite low levels in the economy, and it means, as Joe  said, that we are heading towards 800,000 Australians without a job. All of these things are a  function of the last six years. The second point and final point I would like to make, is that  given Labor's track record of being utter failures at predicting and confirming their future  spending and their future Budget commitments, their debt levels, and all of the rest of it that  we have seen and become used to over the last six years, it is all there, writ large, in this  Treasury statement today. Given that record, the community needs to know from Mr Rudd  just when will they see his costings. I would just say to you, if you go to the Treasury's  election costings website and you click on ‘Labor’, what you will see is a blank page. Here is  a Government, a party, that has been lecturing us for literally months about the Charter of  Budget Honesty, and they are not complying with it. They have a blank page as of today.  What is their program for the next three years? What are they going to do? What policies  have they got in prospect? What we have seen is a history with these statements, of a build-up  of debt, of deficits and all the rest, but not one policy. So Mr Rudd, your job, is to detail  costings and how you are going to fund them. And when you've done that, you can stop  lecturing us. You can start to lecture us on that issue. Thanks   

 REPORTER:    

 Mr Hockey, do you trust the PEFO figures and will they be forming the basis for your  costings?    

 JOE HOCKEY:    

 These are the final set of official figures presented by the Government prior to the election.  We have always said PEFO would be the point from which we would consider the  Government's numbers. I make two points. It was the Government that amended the Charter  of Budget Honesty, to say that you could either use the Treasury, or the Parliamentary Budget  Office. We have been using the Parliamentary Budget Office. We are still waiting on the  Parliamentary Budget Office to come back to us with numbers as a result of the  Government's economic update recently. But, it was the Government that changed the rules  and said either you use the Treasury or the Parliamentary Budget Office. We have chosen to  use the Parliamentary Budget Office, and we are. But, as Andrew has said, the Government  itself isn't using either the Parliamentary Budget Office or the Treasury. They have got no  policies and no costings for the next three years. Let me say emphatically, that Kevin Rudd  cannot talk about the past and he can't pay for his future. That has revealed today. 

 REPORTER:    

 Can you say whether you trust these figures?    

 JOE HOCKEY:    

 I have to start with these figures These are the figures that are presented by the Government.  But, I am also mindful of the downside risks that are identified in the document itself. 

 

 REPORTER:    

 So will your costings be based on these figures?    

 JOE HOCKEY:    

 Our costings are based on the best available information from the Parliamentary Budget  Office, these figures, and a range of other sources.    

 REPORTER:    

 When will we see the release of your costings, now that this PEFO statement has been  released? When might we see those costing and will you give us a guarantee, here today, that  you will release them at least a week out from the election itself - that is, by the end of this  month?    

 JOE HOCKEY:    

 I do not run to your timetables, Tony, I am sorry. But, we are going to go through things  methodically, carefully, prudently, and we will consider all the information available. We  have already put numbers out there. Let's be fair dinkum. We have already put out there that  we are cutting the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation. We have already said that  we are going to reduce the humanitarian intake for refugees from 20,000 to 13,750, at a  saving of around $1.3 billion. We have already said that we are not going to spend $180,000  doing an ergonomic study on the chairs for the Department of Human Services. So we have  already put numbers out there. When it comes to this document, we will be careful, and  methodical.    

 REPORTER:     

 So your position is that Labor should start to immediately release their costings, but when it  comes to your costings, it is some time in the future?    

 JOE HOCKEY:     

 No, the issue for Labor is that Labor hasn't even submitted costings to the Treasury.     

 REPORTER:     

 Well they were Government of the day…    

 JOE HOCKEY:    

 No, I am sorry, the Labor Party has not even submitted policies to the Treasury for costing.  We have. We have submitted over 200 initiatives to the Parliamentary Budget Office for  costing. They are coming back, and a number of them still haven't come back after the last  economic update from the Government. It is the Parliamentary Budget Office, which was set  up by the Parliament and by the Labor party and there is the independent agency to do these  sorts of costings. They still haven't come back to us. I might add, these numbers have  changed in eleven days. So if I had of put out two days ago numbers on the basis of the 

 carbon tax presented eleven days ago, it would be different again, because the number on the  carbon tax has deteriorated by nearly a quarter of a billion dollars.     

 REPORTER:    

 You make the argument for not stating the cost of policy at any given time - tax goes up and  down.    

 JOE HOCKEY:     

 Because this is the final document.    

 REPORTER:     

 Are you saying you won't be releasing your costings until you have got every single thing  back from the PBO?     

 JOE HOCKEY:     

 We are saying we are will take a prudent and responsible approach.     

 REPORTER:     

 Well what is the relevance then of how far the PBO’s through…    

 JOE HOCKEY:     

 Because we’re going to present final figures from the Parliamentary Budget Office.    

 REPORTER:     

 So you won't present it until you have them all, is that right?     

 JOE HOCKEY:     

 That may well be the case. It depends on the timing of the Parliamentary Budget Office, and  that has out of our control.     

 REPORTER:     

 On the question of timing, will it be …[inaudible]…    

 JOE HOCKEY:     

 You will get good time. Labor delivered their costings the day before the election in 2007,  and 2010. We will do better than the day before the election.     

 REPORTER:     

 Can you define what the phrase good time actually means?    

 JOE HOCKEY:     

 People will have a terrific opportunity to have a look at all of our numbers and the details in  them.     

 REPORTER:     

 Can I ask you a question on another matter?    

 JOE HOCKEY:    

 Of course.    

 REPORTER:    

 Mr Pyne said last night on Q&A that during the course of an Abbott Government there would  be no change to the GST. When he was pressed on that matter, whether it was the first term  of the Abbott Government or an Abbott Government into the future, he was a little, evasive.  What did you understand him to mean and would you exclude any possibility of an increase  in the GST during the first term of an Abbott Government or any future term of an Abbott  Government?    

 JOE HOCKEY:     

 It is going to strike you as a little odd, but I didn't see Q&A last night - I had other things on -  so I can't pass comment on what someone else said. There will be no change to the GST full  stop. Anything else?    

 REPORTER:     

 It is part of the review… there seems to be confusion in the Coalition ranks…    

 JOE HOCKEY:     

 No, there is none. There will be no change to the GST, full stop.    

 REPORTER:     

 Will the GST be part of the review?    

 JOE HOCKEY:     

 There will be no change to the GST full stop.    

 REPORTER:     

 Will the GST be part of the review?    

 JOE HOCKEY:    

 I am just saying again, there will be no change to the GST, full stop.  

 

 REPORTER:     

 Will it be reviewed?    

 JOE HOCKEY:     

 Full stop. Anything else?    

 ANDREW ROBB:     

 I just wanted to say, to get back to your earlier point about the expectation of the Government  complying with the Charter of Budget Honesty. The Budget has basically collapsed over the  last ten weeks. It coincides with a time when Mr Rudd has taken over. What is he going to do  if he does get Government again in a few weeks’ time? What is he going to do for the next  three years to deal with that collapse that we have seen in the Budget circumstance? We have  heard nothing. If you think back to the debate the other night, not one policy did he talk about  other than in the most general sort of skills, education, you know, just a bunch of words he  threw out there, but not a policy, not a single policy. They have got a responsibility to  demonstrate what is their action plan? We’ve got a fifty-two page document out there, and we  will - we will be presenting a whole raft of initiatives and the costings, fully funded; is the  Government going to do the same? There has been no pressure on them to front up and  comply with the charter of budget honesty.    

 JOE HOCKEY:     

 Thank you very much.
