 Mentors rewarded for community contribution 

 27/07/2004

 The Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Kay Patterson today congratulated  participants on their achievements in Tasmania's popular Learning Partnerships/Stepping  Forward project.

 Senator Patterson presented certificates to participants who had helped make the  mentoring/training program such a success, including program coordinator Jenny Gee.

 "The project helped to train and motivate local community volunteers who could facilitate  community projects and in turn give something back to their community," Senator Patterson  said.

 "The training organised by Jenny Gee and volunteer, Nettie Burr, included communication,  public speaking, the Australian legal system, project planning and funding submissions,  among other useful tools, from stress management to meeting procedures.

 "The training was delivered to various groups including refugees, community and youth  groups, Country Women's Association members and other members of action groups and  associations. With new skills, these groups have since been able to plan for and complete  local projects while some individuals are now in employment or are undertaking further  training.

 "This program joins the other 188 mentoring and leadership programs which have been  funded under the Australian Government's Stronger Families and Communities Strategy.

 "The Stronger Families and Community Strategy aims to increase the capacity of  communities to undertake and complete community initiatives for themselves, rather than  relying on external assistance - and here in Tasmania we have an excellent example of this.

 "Through programs such as the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy, the Australian  Government continues to show its commitment to strengthening communities, especially in  regional and Indigenous areas, and empowering them to develop local responses to local  issues," Senator Patterson said.
