 WORLDWIDE ASYLUM FIGURES REVEAL RUDD'S BOAT SPIN 

 Mr Scott Morrison MP  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today that official figures from the 

 UNHCRâ€™s monthly data on asylum trends recording the number of asylum applications, has exposed as spin 

 Kevin Rudds claim that the massive increase in illegal boat arrivals is all due to global push factors.  

 Figures released by the UNHCR show that in the nine months to September last year, worldwide asylum 

 applications in 44 key industrialised countries rose by only 5%, while they increased by more than 25% in 

 Australia, Mr Morrison said.  

 This hardly seems like a global push factor responsible for an increase in illegal boat arrivals to Australia from 

 just 1 boat and 14 people in the nine months to September 2008, to 29 boats and more than 1,500 people during 

 the same period in 2009, he said.  

 While figures for asylum applications for the full year are not yet available for all other countries to December, in 

 Australia there was an increase of 30%.  

 In the first nine months of 2009, there were 4,369 applications in Australia, comparedto 3,457 in 2008, an 

 increase of 26%. In the last three months a further 1,805 applications were lodged.  

 During these last three months of 2009 another 32 boats illegally arrived carrying more than 1,250 people. In the 

 first six weeks of 2010 we have had almost 700 people arrive in 12 boats. It took almost six months to reach this 

 level of arrivals in 2008.  

 These figures expose the Governments constant blame of international forces for their problems as just another 

 excuse to do nothing.  

 There have always been push factors, but Australia has not always been a soft touch for people smugglers. It 

 took the Rudd Government to achieve that.  

 This is just another example of Kevin Rudd trying to blame forces outside his control for his own policy failures 

 and weak decisions, as occurred with the Oceanic Viking.  

 This is out of control. It requires action, not more bunk beds and tents, to stop the boats. It takes a resolve that 

 the Rudd Government lacks. Their heart is just not in it.  

 Kevin Rudd promised a tough border protection policy. As revealed in Senate Estimates last week he even 

 thought his policies would result in just 200 people arriving illegally this financial year when he put his budget 

 together.  

 That figure was revised up to 1,400 last November, when 1,000 people had already showed up. But with the last 

 boat arriving on Saturday, there have now been more than 2,600 people arriving illegally this year by boat.  

 The cost for the first underestimate was $132 million. The cost of the rest is; how long is a piece of string? Mr 

 Morrison said.
