 1996-97 HUMANITARIAN PROGRAM

 Australia's 1996-97 Humanitarian Program will consist o f a total o f 12,000 offshore places and 2,000 onshore places, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock,  announced today.

 "This includes the 2,000 offshore places already brought forward or borrowed from the Program  by the former Government and compares with the original Program of 13,000 offshore places for  1995-96," Mr Ruddock said.

 "In its election commitments, the Government stated it would maintain a separate Humanitarian  Program and not reduce the refugee component of that Program. We have delivered on that  commitment because we take our international obligations very seriously."

 The Humanitarian ProgrSm will have three components:

 â¢ Refugee: for people who meet the United Nations Convention definition of a refugee -  3,335 places have been allocated, in addition to the 665 places brought forward and  already taken (a total o f 4,000); â¢ Special Humanitarian Program: for people who have suffered discrimination or other 

 violations o f their human rights but are not refugees - 2,133 places have been allocated  in addition to the 667 places already taken; (a total o f 2,800) and, â¢ Special Assistance Category: for those in vulnerable positions overseas and who have  close links with Australia - 4,532 places have been allocated, in addition to the 668 places 

 already taken, (a total o f 5,200)

 The Refugee and Special Humanitarian categories remain unchanged from the original 1995-96  levels, after taking into account the bring forward. The reduction o f 1,000 places in the net level  is in the Special Assistance Category, reflecting an easing o f conflicts and tension in areas o f the 

 world addressed by this category.

 "Priority in the Humanitarian Program will continue to be given to the regions o f the former  Yugoslavia, the Middle East and Africa," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Those in the greatest need will be assisted. Our priorities take close account o f the needs for  humanitarian resettlement identified by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and  communities within Australia."

 "I have recently reviewed the Special Assistance Category and have begun considering the  detailed allocation of places, based on the international situation and community support."

 The 2,000 places allocated onshore will provide for the estimated number of people granted  permanent residence as a result o f meeting the United Nations' refugee criteria in Australia. Should on-shore grants exceed 2,000, the excess will be absorbed into the offshore program, so  that humanitarian resettlement services can properly meet needs.

 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  ON THE 1996-97 HUMANITARIAN PROGRAM 1. Have we kept our commitments  on the  1996-97 H umanitarian  P rogram ?

 The answer is yes!

 Commitment: "The Refugee and Humanitarian  Program will be maintained as a separate  program."

 Outcome: The Refugee and Humanitarian Program for 1996-97 is being maintained as a  separate program. â  Commitment honoured.

 Commitment: "The refugee component of the  Program will not be reduced."

 Outcome: Refugees make up just one

 component o f the Humanitarian Program. In  1995-96, they comprised 4,000 offshore places.  In 1996-97, they will again comprise 4,000  offshore places, although some have already  been taken. â  Commitment honoured.

 (The 1996-97 Humanitarian Program has a total of 12,000 off-shore places allocated. It includes 2,000  places brought forward or borrowed from the 1996­ 97 Program by the former Government. The 2,000  places have already been taken, but belong to 1996­ 97. Within the 2,000 places are 665 set aside for  refugees.

 This accords with statements by the former Labor  Minister on 27 November 1995 before Senate  Estimates. When questioned about the possible size  of next year's program, he said "You will have a  (1996-97 Humanitarian) program of 13,000, o f  which 11,000 will be processed through 1996-97..."

 Using this same argument, the 1996-97 Refugee  component of the Humanitarian Program is 4,000, of  which 3,333 will be processed through 1996-97.)

 Commitment: "The efficiency and equity of  Special Assistance Categories will be reviewed."

 Outcome: The efficiency and equity of the practice o f establishing ad hoc SACs has been  reviewed by the Minister to ensure the legitimate  claims other humanitarian applicants are not  unfairly disadvantaged. The composition of the  new SAC categories will be released shortly.

 â  Commitment honoured.

 2. H ow  does the 1996-97 offshore 

 Humanitarian Program compare with THE PREVIOUS YEAR?

 The 1996-97 offshore Humanitarian Program in  total, has 1,000 fewer places than the 1995-96  Program. '

 The reduction has occurred in the Special  Assistance Category and reflects the easing in  conflicts and tensions addressed by this 

 category.

 The 1995-96 Humanitarian Program was set at 13.000 places by the former Government. The  1996-97 offshore Humanitarian Program has 12.000 places, o f which 2,000 have already been  taken, because of the "bring forward" by the  former Labour Government.

 (see Senate Estimates above)

 3. WHO IS A REFUGEE?

 The United Nations Convention defines a  refugee as:

 â¢ People who have fled their country of 

 nationality or their usual country of 

 residence; and

 â¢ are unable or unwilling to return or to seek  the protection of that country because o f a  well-founded fear o f persecution for  reasons o f race, religion, nationality, 

 membership of a particular social group or  political opinion.

 Refugees are just one component o f Australia's  Humanitarian Program. It is wrong to talk about  the Humanitarian Program as being all refugees.

 Many people misuse the terminology refugee to  refer to anyone in a vulnerable position either in  Australia or overseas. This devalues the 

 seriousness o f the plight o f refugees around the  world.  I
