 Greens’ immigration spokesperson - Senator Sarah Hanson-Young   

 Monday, 28 April, 2014   

 Statement from Senator Sarah Hanson-Young in response to tonight’s Four Corners report on the  Manus Island attacks;    

  “Aspirations for safety aren’t good enough when you’re playing with people’s lives,” the Greens’  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “Manus Island is a powder keg, waiting to go off for a second time, and it must be closed down now.    

 “The Australian Government cannot continue to pretend that they don't know how toxic and  inhumane the Manus Island camp is.    

 “It’s only cruelty that’s keeping people locked up in the Manus Island detention camp. There’s no  moral justification for forcing such fear and suffering onto refugees.    

 “The Manus Island camp is untenable. How many more people need to be hurt before all sides of  politics realise it must be closed?    

 “Scott Morrison’s ‘aspirations’ weren’t good enough to keep Reza Barati safe in February and they  still aren’t good enough now.     

 “The Abbott Government is hiding behind its internal review and refusing to come clean with the  Australian people about what really happened that night. The public deserves better and the  refugees and staff on Manus Island deserve safety.”    

 

 Thank you
