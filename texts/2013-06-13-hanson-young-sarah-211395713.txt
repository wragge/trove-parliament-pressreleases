 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Thursday, 13th June 2013   

 ASIO assessed family’s release shows need for  rigorous review   

 A review process for adverse ASIO assessments must be put in law after a second family was  released from indefinite detention, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “I am so relieved this loving and caring family has finally been released and that their nightmare  has now ended,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said   

 “This is further proof of why we need periodic reviews of ASIO assessments set in law, as well as  a merits review process where refugees are given a right of reply.    

 “This government’s brutal bureaucracy has held a family in detention, under 24 hour watch, for  almost 4 years and now we find out it was unwarranted.   

 “The children have suffered so much and they will never get those years back. The youngest  child was born into Australian detention almost three years ago and is only now seeing freedom  for the first time.   

 “I have been visiting the Rahavan family over the past 3 years and each time I saw them it  became increasingly clear that their mental health was suffering.   

 “The system knowingly broke them every single day and we can't risk this happening again.   

 “The law needs to change to ensure a proper, fair process that will guarantee no more children  or their families will be subjected to this wrongful and devastating trauma.”
