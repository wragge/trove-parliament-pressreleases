 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Thursday 24 April, 2014 

 Guards assaulting refugee children not acceptable 

 Reports today that children are being verbally and physically assaulted by local security staff at  the Nauru Detention Centre are extremely concerning and must be addressed immediately, the  Australian Greens have said. 

 “The Government has a responsibility to provide care and protection to these children and they  have neglected that responsibility today”, the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young said.  

 “The Department must investigate these incidents immediately. An internal investigation  undertaken by the very organisation allegedly responsible for the attacks is simply not good  enough.  

 “We know that indefinite detention has serious mental health implications for children and now  there is mounting evidence that these children aren’t even safe at the hands of the very people  responsible for looking after them.  

 “The Abbott Government cannot ensure the safety of these vulnerable children when they are  locked up on a remote island prison.  

 “They must be brought to Australia immediately where they can live in a safe environment, free  from threat.”
