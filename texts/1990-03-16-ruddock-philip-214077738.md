 MIGRATION CHALLENGE UNWORTHY

 The Prime Minister's desperate attempts to reopen the Immigration  debate and create fear in Ethnic Comunities will fail.

 In relation to each of the areas identified by him, sound and  substantial reasons exist for the decisions taken by the  Opposition.

 First, reduced expenditure in Immigration Department Administration  involves no reduction in Settlement or Ethnic Affairs programs.

 Second, the changes to Social Security arrangements for migration  are important to the maintenance of equity between sponsored  migrants and to ensure justice also to Australian taxpayers.

 Third, the extension of the qualifying period for citizenship will  place a proper emphasis on the importance of Australian citizenship  and constitute no real hardship.

 So far as Labor's limited spending initiatives are concerned they  fail to address the principal complaints about inadequate funding  for Adult Migrant Education for the teaching of English, arbitrary  restrictions on admission to community language programs and  refusal to fund organisations like the Refugee Advice and Caseworks  Service - for assisting those with concerns arising from arbitrary  and unconscionable Migration Regulations.

 While the Prime Minister has had a special Ethnic Affairs Policy  launch it offers no real hope for those who have been disadvantaged  by Labor's failure to administer fairly and equalitably the  Immigration Program.

 It also fails to address the real concerns experienced by Ethnic  Communities in seeking funding support for Ethnic Affairs projects.
