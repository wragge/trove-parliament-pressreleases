 42 BOATS BUT ABBOTT’S DESTRUCTIVE NEGATIVITY IS  UNWAVERING   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare MP, today called on Tony Abbott to work with the Government to  implement offshore processing as another boat was intercepted overnight.   

 Mr Bowen said the 42nd boat since the Coalition refused to negotiate a compromise - even  rejecting Nauru - showed that the arrivals were continuing to increase, as predicted.   

 “I have said it before and Iâll say it again - boats will continue to come for as long as Tony  Abbott and Scott Morrison put their political interests ahead of the national interest,” Mr  Bowen said.   

 “Tony Abbottâs destructive negativity knows no bounds. But until the Coalition is prepared to  allow offshore processing to occur, the Australian people can only conclude that he prefers  to see more boats arrive, because itâs in Mr Abbottâs political interests.”   

 Mr Clare said it was time for Mr Abbott to act in the national interest and stop saying ânoâ to  Nauru and Malaysia.   

 “Working together we can help stop people dying at sea. We can pass legislation that is in  the Parliament right now to introduce offshore processing,” Mr Clare said.   

 “If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must get out of the way, stop saying  ânoâ and pass this legislation to allow asylum seekers to be processed offshore.”
