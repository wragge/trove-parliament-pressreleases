 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 05/250 SUNDAY 15 MAY 2005   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT  AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS IMMIGRATION SPOKESPERSON TIME TO SEE THE TRUTH  VANSTONE RESIGNATION WON'T SOLVE MAIN PROBLEMS The Australian Democrats say resignations from the Immigration Minister, Senator Vanstone, or the Secretary of her Department, would do little to solve the massive problems at the core of the migration laws and how they are administered. Democrats' Deputy Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, says there will be more stories of major incompetence and unnecessary suffering emerging over coming weeks and months, and only a Royal Commission will get the bottom of the problems of this key area of public policy  Speaking before departing for his third visit to the asylum seekers imprisoned on Nauru, Senator Bartlett said changing Ministers won't change the fact that hiding and distorting the truth had been a core part of this Government's attitude towards immigration issues for a long time, and that culture of dishonesty has infected much of the Department.   "Locking people away out of sight on Nauru is a perfect symbol of how this Government tries to hide and ignore the facts." Prime Minister Howard said this morning "until I have evidence of bad administration or systemic failure, I am not going to do other than support the departmentâ€¦" (Channel Ten Meet the Press) "There is already ample evidence of appalling administration and a huge failure in duty of care from this Department and its Minister that has come out through Senate Inquiries, Court judgements, and Inquiries by the Human Rights Commission. The Prime Minister's comment is just typical of this Government's unacceptable habit of ignoring facts that they don't like." "This Minister has not even visited Nauru once to see the reality of her Government's laws and policies.   I doubt she has met with any of the detainees on Christmas Island either. It is time for her to get out from behind her desk and see the personal results of her Department's activities. "The Palmer inquiry may well produce valuable insights, but it will not give anything like a complete picture because of its narrow focus and limited powers." This issue goes beyond asylum seekers and refugees. The actions of the Immigration Department affect the lives of millions of people each year and is a crucial component of our social and economic future. A failure to act with a Royal Commission will be detrimental to our nation's future, as well as directly and unfairly harm the lives of many." Media contact: Senator Andrew Bartlett - 0418 743 789
