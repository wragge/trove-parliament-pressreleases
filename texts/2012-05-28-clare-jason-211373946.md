 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 28 May 2012 

 

 ANOTHER BOAT, ANOTHER ‘NO’ FROM TONY ABBOTT   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare MP, today said the latest boat arrival was more evidence that unless  Tony Abbott acted in the national interest to implement offshore processing, the boats  would continue to arrive.   

 Today’s boat is the 38th since Mr Abbott and the Coalition chose relentless negativity over  working with the Government in the national interest.   

 “With the announcement of the Malaysia Arrangement last year, we saw boat arrival  numbers drop. We are now in a very different situation,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “If the Coalition is truly concerned about continued boat arrivals, it should get out of the  way and allow the government of the day to implement its border protection policies.”   

 Mr Clare said a genuine deterrent such as the Malaysia Arrangement was needed to prevent  people from risking their lives at sea to get to Australia.    

 “Working together we can help stop people dying at sea. We can pass legislation to  introduce offshore processing,” Mr Clare said.   

 “If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must stop saying no and pass our  legislation to allow asylum seekers to be processed offshore in Malaysia and Nauru.”
