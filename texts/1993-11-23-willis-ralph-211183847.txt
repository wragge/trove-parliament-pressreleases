 STATEMENT OF COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS - NOVEMBER 1993

 MINISTER FOR FINANCE THE HONOURABLE RALPH WILLIS, MP

 The statement of Commonwealth Government financial transactions for November 1993 is now available.

 MONTH OF NOVEMBER 1993 ANALYSIS

 â¢ A deficit of $624m was recorded in November 1993 compared to a deficit of $1 912m in October 1993 and a deficit of $2 607m in November 1992.

 Outlays of $7 606m were recorded in November 1993 compared to $8 119m in October 1993 and $8 257m in November 1992. Outlays in November 1993 were reduced by the receipts from asset sales, mainly the Commonwealth Bank Secondary Share Offer.

 Revenue of $6 983m was recorded in November 1993 compared to $6 207m in October 1993 and $5 650m in November 1992.

 YEAR TO DATE ANAL PSIS

 Table 1 provides a comparison of outlays and revenue up to November 1993 with the same period in the previous year. Budgeted annual growth figures for 1993-94 are included.

 â¢ A cumulative deficit of $5 498m was recorded in November 1993 compared to $4 874m in October 1993 and $8 672m in November 1992;

 â¢ Cumulative outlays of $45 989m were recorded in November 1993 compared to $38 382m in October 1993 and $45 173m in November 1992; and

 â¢ Cumulative revenue of $40 491 m was recorded in November 1993 compared to $33 508m in October 1993 and $36 501m in November 1992.

 CHART ANALYSIS

 Chart i presents the cumulative monthly balance and shows that in November the cumulative deficit increased. Chart 2 presents the cumulative monthly pattern of outlays and shows that in November 1993 cumulative outlays were below the pro-rated Budget estimate. Outlays in the month of November were also below the monthly average of the Budget estimate. Chart 3 presents the cumulative monthly pattern of revenue and shows that cumulative revenue was below the pro-rated Budget estimate. Revenue in the month of November 1993 was also below the monthly average of

 the Budget estimate.

 Charts 1, 2 and 3 also show the variability of the cumulative balance, outlays and revenue. These charts indicate that the outcome for outlays, revenue and balance to November 1993 cannot be extrapolated to

 estimate the outcome for 1993-94.

 COMPONENTS OF THE BALANCE

 The overseas deficit for November 1993 year to date was $851m, while the domestic deficit was $4 647m. Major components of the overseas deficit are provided in Table 2.

 A TTACHMENTS

 A summary of outlays by function and revenue is presented at Attachment A and a summary of outlays by economic type is presented at Attachment B.

 Attachment C provides a new presentation of outlays and revenue trends, through Charts 4 and 5 which show monthly outlays and revenue as a percentage of the total

 COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY MICAH

 for the year. It is intended, subject to any further

 comment from users, that these charts replace the current version of Charts 2 and 3 starting from the January release.

 OUTLA YS

 Analysis by Function

 In the following paragraphs, items are identified where the year to date (YTD) growth (actual outlays this year compared to the same period last year) significantly differs (in % and $ terms) from the budgeted growth for the full year (as published in the Budget). This method

 minimises the impact of seasonal variation on the analysis.

 Attachment A provides a summary of outlays by function and highlights significant differences in YTD growth in relation to budgeted growth for the year as a whole (shown here in brackets). Such differences are due to:

 timing factors;

 â¢ seasonal influences (the expected seasonal pattern affecting the timing of budgeted growth and changes in the seasonal pattern affecting YTD growth); and

 â¢ activity changes.

 Defence (-7.1%). The variation is due to the timing of equipment purchases and redundancies, the repayment by the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) of $60m for DHA advances and delays in payments of employer superannuation contributions to the Retirement Benefits Office for civilian personnel. These reductions have been

 partially offset by accelerated outlays on buildings and works.

 Education (1.5%). Higher outlays mainly reflect earlier capital payments to Government Schools, recurrent payments to Non-Government Schools and TAFE recurrent payments. These higher outlays were partially offset by lower payments to higher educational

 institutions, lower growth in ABSTUDY and Migrant Education outlays and the delayed implementation of the Schools Joint Program and Open Learning Initiative. Policy changes to AUSTUDY in the 1993-94 Budget will begin having an effect from I January 1994.

 Health (-0.9%). This result reflects lower than expected spending on Veterans and Dependants medical services due to processing delays and the uneven spending patterns of the General Practice Reform Program. These

 have been partially offset by higher than anticipated outlays on both Medical Benefits and Pharmaceutical Benefits.

 Social Securi ty and Welfare (4.3%). Mainly reflects the increases in outlays for Age Pension and Disability Support Pension, as a result of larger than projected client numbers, and irregular payments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. These have been partially offset by decreased outlays in the Aged Persons' Hostels and Sole Parent Pension.

 (c) A fall in the line shows that revenue for that month was below the monthly average.

 (d) The revenue profiles underlying this chart are subject to much greater vari ation than outlays from one year to the next, especially where there are changes to payment arrangements. It is therefore invalid to project a likely outcome for revenue an the basis of

 previous years . profiles.

 Housing and Community Amenities nec (-9.2%).

 Mainly reflects new cash management procedures introduced under the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement (CSHA) where funds are actually paid to the States when they are required for construction and maintenance.

 Transport and Communication (36.8%). Mainly reflects that certain offsetting receipts from GBEs in the Aviation and Communication areas are not expected until later in the financial year.

 Industry Assistance and Development (-13.2%). Mainly reflects slow uptake of assistance in the printing and pharmaceutical sectors and the impact of lower wool tax collections on wool industry assistance.

 Labour and Employment (22.8%). Higher outlays on Vocational and Industry Training reflect commitments from last financial year and an increase in Additional Grant payments in the Entry Level Training Program. Higher outlays on Labour Market Assistance to Jobseekers & Industry reflect commitments from last financial year and an increase in Labour Market Program activities in the early part of the financial year.

 Foreign Affairs and Overseas Aid ( -7.5%). Mainly reflects the timing of payments of various programs such as refugee relief and emergency aid.

 Administrative Services (- 1.8%). Mainly reflects irregular outlays on estate management, FBI receipts from on-budget departments and agencies (which are classified as offsets to outlays) and payments on Customs' capital projects.

 Assistance to Oilier Governments (-24.2%). Mainly reflects higher sinking fund receipts (which are classified as offsets to outlays) and lower outlays on Financial Assistance Grants to the States reflecting variations in the timing of payments.

 Public Debt Interest (-13.6%). Mainly reflects uneven timing of transactions throughout the year, particularly the receipt of premiums (which are classified as offsets to outlays).

 Analysis by Economic Type

 Attachment B presents the impact of outlays on different sectors in the economy, in a format consistent with the ABS Government Finance Statistics, and highlights significant divergence from budgeted outlays growth

 (shown here in brackets) which is calculated on the same basis as the functional analysis:

 lower current outlays on goods and services (-5.1%) mainly reflecting lower outlays on Defence equipment and Defence personnel and retirement payments;

 â¢ lower interest payments (-13.4%) mainly reflecting uneven timing of transactions throughout the year, particularly the receipt of premiums;

 â¢ higher outlays on subsidies (4.8%) mainly reflecting higher outlays on industry assistance through wage subsidies for Jobseekers;

 â¢ higher personal benefit payments (4.5%) mainly reflecting higher outlays on Additional Family Payments, Basic Family Payments, Age Pensions and â¢ Allowances;

 â¢ .lower grants to the Commonwealth non-budget sector (-3.4%) mainly reflecting lower outlays on Higher Education grants to the Australian National University and the University of Canberra;

 higher current grants to State governments (3.1%) mainly reflecting variations in the timing of Financial Assistance Grants to the States; and

 â¢ higher capital grants to State governments (20.3%) mainly reflecting earlier capital payments to Government Schools.

 REVENUE

 Total revenue collections in November 1993 were $6 983m, 23.6% above collections in November 1992. Total collections in the first five months of 1993-94 were $40 491m, 10.9% above collections in the corresponding period last year.

 Gross PAYE collections (including the Medicare levy) in the five months to November 1993 were $20 030m, up 5.9% on collections in the same period last year. This strengthening reflects growth in wages and employment

 in the past year and the increased rate of the Medicare levy from I July 1993.

 Gross collections from non-PAYE (other) individuals (including the Medicare levy) in five months to end-November 1993 were $1 471m, down 3.6% on collections in the same period last year. This mainly reflects lower quarterly provisional tax payments.

 Gross collections under the prescribed payments system (including the Medicare levy) in the five months to end-November 1993 totalled $788m, up 12.2% on collections in the same period last year. This is in line with strengthening in dwelling investment.

 Total individual income tax refunds (including the Medicare levy) in the five months to end-November 1993 were $4 851 m, down 6.6% on refunds in the same period last year. This is consistent with the factors outlined in Budget Statement 4, namely the replacement of tax concessions for superannuation contributions made by supported employees with an income-tested rebate, and ATO initiatives to improve compliance by taxpayers who claim work-related expenses.

 Collections of company tax for the five months to end-November 1993 were $6 046m, up 7.2% on collections in the same period last year. This in part

 reflects strong initial payments from June and September

 balancing companies.

 Superannuation tax collections during the first five months of 1993-94 were $569m, down 21.1% on collections in the corresponding period last year. This partly results from life offices transferring liability to the company tax head of revenue.

 Withholding tax collections were $368m in the five months to end-November 1993, up 9.3% on collections in the same period last year. This reflects the introduction of the royalty withholding tax on 1 July

 1993 partly offset by lower collections of other withholding taxes.

 Petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) collections were $642m in the first five months of 1993-94, down 6.4% on collections in the first five months of 1992-93. This is consistent with the expected decrease in production volumes and higher deductions for capital expenditure by oil producers as outlined in Budget Statement 4.

 Fringe benefits tax (FBT) collections in the five months to end-November 1993 were $567m, down 5.1% on collections in the same period last year. This reflects a higher rate of refunds and a decline in the number of FBT taxpayers.

 Total sales tax collections during the five months to end-November 1993 were $4 217m, 10.1% above collections for the same period last year. This reflects a strengthening in private consumption expenditure and the increase in the wholesale sales tax rate announced in the 1993-94 Budget.

 Total excise duty collections during the five months to end-November 1993 were $4 343m, 12.2% above collections in the same period last year. This partly reflects growth in demand for excisable products in the past year and higher excise rates introduced in the Budget.

 Collections of customs duty on imports amounted to $1 348m, 5.1% below collections for the same period last year. This is consistent with the forecast fall in customs duty, as outlined in Budget Statement 4, as a result of tariff rate reductions.

 Collections of other taxes, fees and fines were $509m in the first five months of 1993-94, 4.5% below collections in the same period last year.

 Non-tax revenue collections in the first five months of 1993-94 were $4 444m, 52.2% above collections in the same period last year. This largely reflects higher dividend payments from Telstra, the Reserve Bank and the Royal Australian Mint and higher collections from petroleum royalties, partly offset by lower interest revenue.
