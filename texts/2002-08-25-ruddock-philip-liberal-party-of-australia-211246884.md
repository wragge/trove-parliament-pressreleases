 12 MONTHS ON - AUSTRALIA BALANCES CONTROL WITH COMPASSION

 Australia's  strong  action  in  standing  up  to  people  smugglers  has  started  to  earn some dividends, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today.

 The Government’s action in relation to the asylum seekers on the Tampa was firmly based on a desire to ensure that the asylum system protected those at greatest risk and was not abused by those seeking migration outcomes.

 “It was becoming increasingly clear that people were paying criminal gangs to access Australia  and  gain  a  migration  outcome  to  which  they  were  not  entitled  ahead  of those in much greater need.

 “In  relation  to  those  on  the  Tampa,  it  should  not  be  forgotten  that  the  Tampa’s captain  received  authority  from  Indonesia  to  proceed  to  its  port  of  Merak  to disembark the passengers.  However, the rescued asylum seekers put the captain of the  Tampa  under  duress  and  forced  him  to  turn  around  and  head  to  Christmas Island.

 “The  Government’s  actions  in  refusing  to  disembark  the  rescued  asylum  seekers were entirely justifiable and consistent with international law. These people were not in  danger  of  persecution  in  Indonesia  and  they  by-passed  several  countries  where they could have sought protection.

 “There is no right at international law for an individual to enter the territory of a State of which that individual is not a national, nor does international law give refugees any right to choose the country in which they will be protected from persecution. The only obligation that the Convention imposes upon Australia as a signatory state is not to return refugees to a country where they will be persecuted.  Australia does not return refugees to face persecution.

 “The  Government  determined  that  we  would  no  longer  allow  people  smugglers  to decide Australia’s migration program and smash the international protection system,” Mr Ruddock said.

 Mr  Ruddock  said  the  laws  passed  to  regain  control  of  our  refugee  and  migration program had the support of the Labor Party in Parliament.
