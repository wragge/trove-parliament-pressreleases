 MEDIA RELEASE 

 22 February 2012 

 BOATS DOUBLE SINCE TONY ABBOTT’S SAID ‘NO’   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home Affairs,  Jason Clare MP have called on Tony Abbott to put aside his negativity and vote for offshore  processing as more asylum seekers risk dangerous boat journeys to Australia.   

 Two more boats carrying more than 90 asylum seekers each were intercepted overnight - the  eighth and ninth boat arrivals since Tony Abbott ended talks with the Government and rejected  offshore processing.   

 In the five months before Tony Abbott said ânoâ to our legislation in September 23 boats and  1398 asylum seekers arrived. In the five months since Tony Abbott said ânoâ in September 45  boats and 3465 people arrived.   

 Mr Bowen said the number of boats had almost doubled and the number of asylum seekers more  than doubled since Mr Abbott chose to oppose the Governmentâs legislation to implement the  Malaysia Arrangement last September.   

 “We know that the boats slowed following the announcement of the Malaysia Arrangement, but  the numbers continue to rise following Tony Abbottâs rejection of an offshore processing regime -  including his own policy of a processing centre on Nauru,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “Enough is enough. Australians expect Mr Abbott to work with the Government to stop people  risking their lives at sea.”   

 “Tony Abbott says he wants to stop the boats, but he is not willing to do what it takes to make  this happen - itâs all talk and no action.”   

 The Government has consistently warned that without a real deterrent for these dangerous  journeys to Australia, the boats would keep coming.   

 Mr Clare said the boats would keep coming while Tony Abbott said 'no'.   

 “If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must stop saying 'no' and pass our  legislation to allow asylum seekers to be processed off-shore in Malaysia and Nauru,” Mr Clare  said.  Media Contacts: Bill Kyriakopoulos 0400 510 802 (Bowen)
