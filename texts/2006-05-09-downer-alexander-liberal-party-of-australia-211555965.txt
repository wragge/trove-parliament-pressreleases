 MEDIA RELEASE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER FA042  /  AA0617         9  May  2006  

 

 A MORE EFFECTIVE AID PROGRAMME   

 I  am pleased  to  announce  that  Australia  will  provide an estimated $2.946 billion in Official  Development  Assistance  (ODA)  in  2006-07,  an  increase  of  $455  million  over  the  2005-06   Budget figure ($2.491 billion). This represents a real increase of 9.0 per cent over the 2005-06  expected  outcome  of  $2.641  billion,  or  a  15.5  per  cent  increase  budget  to  budget.  It  is  the   sixth successive budget where the Government has delivered real growth in ODA. Australia’s 

 ODA/GNI  ratio  is  estimated  at  0.30  per  cent  for  2006-07  and  Australia  is  one  of  only  six   donor  countries  to  show  consecutive  real  increases  in  ODA  between  2001  and  2005   (excluding debt relief).   

 An Aid White Paper: Australian Aid: Promoting Growth and Stability   

 2006-07 will be a watershed year for Australia’s overseas aid programme. The White Paper:  Australian Aid: Promoting Growth and Stability, which I launched in April, outlines how the  Government  will  approach  the  goal  of  doubling  Australia’s  annual  aid  expenditure  to  about   $4 billion by 2010, as announced by the Prime Minister in September 2005.   

 The  White  Paper  focuses  on  four  key  themes:  accelerating  economic  growth,  fostering   functioning  and  effective  states,  investing  in  people,  and  promoting  regional  stability  and   cooperation.  The  Government  will  also  emphasise  three  overarching  principles  for  the  aid   programme:  firstly,  a  greater  commitment  to  gender  equality  across  all  aspects  of  the  aid   programme; secondly, a closer partnership with recipient countries through the greater use of  local systems and processes; and finally, the untying of Australian aid to enhance competition  and value for money.   

 Enhanced aid effectiveness  The  Government  is  committed  to  increasing  further  the  effectiveness  of  the  aid  programme   and  ensuring  that  additional  aid  dollars  are  spent  effectively.  The  medium-term  goal  of  a   significant increase in Australian overseas aid is contingent on the effective performance of  partner  governments  and  institutions  and  reduced  corruption  in  recipient  countries.  The   Government  will  publish  an  Annual  Review  of  Development  Effectiveness,  the  first  to  be   produced  later  this  year,  to  provide  a  practical  link  between  increased  resources  and  aid   effectiveness.   

 The  effectiveness  of  the  aid  programme  will  be  strengthened  through  four  interlinked   strategies:  strengthening  its  performance  orientation,  combating  corruption,  strengthening   Australia’s  engagement  with  the  Asia-Pacific  region,  and  working  in  partnership  with   regional governments and other donors.   

 Combating corruption  Addressing  corruption  is  a  prominent  theme  in  the  aid  programme  and  will  become  a  more   explicit  consideration  when  designing  and  implementing  aid  activities.  AusAID  will   increasingly  work  with  other  Australian  Government  agencies  and  through  regional  and   global initiatives to help fight corruption. Australia will support Papua New Guinea’s (PNG)

 own  efforts  to  combat  corruption,  such  as  through  the  Enhanced  Cooperation  Programme   (ECP).  In  Asia,  alongside  other  APEC  countries,  Australia  has  committed  $3  million  over   three years to support regional anti-corruption initiatives.   

 Major new initiatives for 2006-07  For  2006-07,  major  initiatives  to  be  implemented  include  a  significantly  expanded   scholarships programme: Australian Scholarships, additional debt relief for heavily indebted  poor countries, and strengthening pandemic preparedness. The aid programme will maintain  its focus on PNG and Indonesia, as well as other parts of the Pacific, and East Asia.   

 The coming year will involve significant planning and development of key initiatives outlined  in the White Paper, with implementation to occur from 2007 onwards. Principal among these  are  the  Infrastructure  for  Growth  initiative;  the  Australia-Pacific  Technical  College;  the  development  of  performance  incentives  for  partner  countries;  and  major  initiatives  on   Delivering  Better  Health,  particularly  for  women  and  children,  and  Delivering  Better   Education.   

 A significantly expanded Australian scholarships programme  The  Australian  Government  will  provide  nearly  $1.4  billion  over  the  next  five  years  in   support of tertiary education across the region through an enhanced scholarships programme.  The  package  is  to  be  known  as  Australian Scholarships  and  includes  an  additional   $442.5 million of new funding (including aid programme funding of $257 million). This will  more than double the number of education awards over five years. The awards will be granted  to over 19,000 students from developing countries to study and conduct research in Australia.  Australian Scholarships  will  bring  existing  scholarship  programmes  from  the  Australian   Department  of  Education,  Science  and  Training  (DEST)  and  AusAID  together  under  one   umbrella.  It  will  also  include  a new category of scholarship: Australian Leadership Awards,  focused on developing future leaders in the region.   

 A substantial contribution to debt relief  In 2006-07, Australia will provide a substantial contribution of $136.2 million to finance its  share  of  multilateral  debt  relief  for  the  world’s  poorest  countries,  as  announced  by  the  G8   Finance Ministers in June 2005. The funding will enable full upfront payment of Australia’s  contribution for an initial 10 year period from 2006-07 to 2015-16. Australian support to the  Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) will allow the World Bank to provide 100 per cent  debt  relief  to  eligible  countries  that  qualify  under  the  Heavily  Indebted  Poor  Countries   (HIPC) Initiative.   

 On  the  signing  of  a  bilateral  agreement  with  Iraq  following  the  Paris  Club  agreement  of   November 2004, Australia, in line with other aid donors, will recognise debt relief to Iraq of  $334  million  in  2006-07  in  addition  to  $334  million  in  2005-06.  Final  recognition  of  the   balance of Iraq debt relief will occur in later years. 

 Strengthened pandemic preparedness in our region  Pandemic  and  infectious  diseases  such  as  Avian  Influenza  threaten  the  stability  and  growth   prospects  of  our  neighbours.  As  announced  at  the  APEC  meeting  in  November   2005,   Australia  will  take  a  proactive  approach  to  address  the  threat  of  pandemics  and  Avian   Influenza in the region. Australia has committed $100 million over four years to this effort. In  2006-07, $38.6 million of this funding will assist partner countries prepare for outbreaks, and  support  relevant  international  organisations  to  provide  a  coordinated  response  to  pandemic   threats in our region.   

 

 

 

 Country and Regional Programmes   

 Improving development outcomes in PNG and the Pacific  Total  ODA  to  PNG  in  2006-07  will  be  $332.2  million.  Australian  support  to  PNG  will  be   guided  by  a  new  country  strategy  which  focuses  on  sustainable  economic  growth  and   productivity, governance and nation building, stability and service delivery, and HIV/AIDS.  Australia is developing a performance-based partnership with PNG that is underpinned by the  new  country  strategy  and  performance  framework.  The  revised  ECP  will  have  a  clear   anti-corruption  focus  and  will  assist  law  and  justice,  support  economic  and  public  sector   reform, and enhance border and transport security. The aid programme is supporting PNG’s  National Action Plan for HIV/AIDS and will boost measures to address related gender issues.   

 In  2006-07,  ODA  to  the  rest  of  the  Pacific  will  total  $434.4  million,  with  a  focus  on   Melanesian Countries including Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Australia will promote greater  economic  prosperity  in  the  Pacific.  The  Pacific  2020  report,  to  be  released  in  May  2006,   provides  policy  options  in  nine  key  areas  to  stimulate  economic  growth.  Planning  for  the   Pacific  Land  Mobilisation  programme,  a  key  White  Paper  initiative,  will  be  progressed  in   2006-07  for  early  implementation.  In  its  initial  stages,  the  programme  will  survey  and   disseminate information on innovative land tenure practices and, where there is clear demand  for it, support innovations and improvements in land tenure arrangements. Australia will also  support  the  implementation  of  recommendations  from  the  Pacific  Plan  including  enhanced   regional  audit  arrangements,  establishing  a  regional  Ombudsman’s  office  and  upgrading   statistical systems. 

 

 In  2006-07  work  will  commence  on  the  establishment  of  the  

 Australia-Pacific Technical College  in  the  Pacific  region  in  order  to  deliver  Australian-standard qualifications, boost skill levels in the region and improve employment opportunities  for youth. Training will be initially drawn from health care and personal services, hospitality  and tourism, and the automotive, construction and electrical trades.   

 In  Solomon  Islands,  assistance  will  total  $223  million  for  2006-07  and  will  be  guided  by  a   new  transitional  country  strategy.  The  Machinery  of  Government  Programme  will  stimulate   public  sector  and  financial  management  reforms  and  demand  for  better  governance.   Assistance to the law and justice sector will be enhanced. In Vanuatu, we will commence a  new governance initiative, along with a new police and capacity building programme. Total  ODA  will  increase  to  $34.7  million.  Funding  for  Pacific  Regional  programmes  will  total   $73.5  million  and  will  support  pandemic  preparedness,  HIV/AIDS  initiatives  and   environment programmes.   

 Fostering growth and development in East Asia  Priorities  in  East  Asia  include  accelerating  economic  growth  and  managing  transnational   threats through regional programmes and fora such as ASEAN and APEC. There will be an  increased focus on the Mekong subregion, such as through support to the Asian Development  Bank’s  Greater  Mekong  Sub-region  Initiative.  Key  bilateral  partners  in  the  region  are   Indonesia,  Vietnam  and  the  Philippines.  Total  ODA  to  the  East  Asia  Region  will  be   $713.4 million in 2006-07.   

 

 

 Australia  is  committed  to  a  long-term  development  partnership  with  Indonesia.  The  aid  

 

 

 programme  will  work  to  strengthen  economic  and  public  sector  management,  build   democratic  institutions  and  improve  the  quality  of  service  delivery.  ODA  to  Indonesia  for   2006-07  will  total  $344.3  million  including  the  Australia-Indonesia  Partnership  for   Reconstruction  and  Development  (AIPRD).  Key  priorities  for  the  AIPRD  will  include  

 education, road infrastructure and government partnerships.   

 Total ODA to the Philippines will increase to $68.8 million and will be used to promote more  effective  economic  governance,  fiscal  policy  reform,  private  sector  growth,  and  improved   security  and  stability.  Particular  emphasis  will  be  placed  on  building  peace  and  supporting   education in the southern Philippines.   

 The  aid  programme  will  support  Vietnam’s  Five  Year  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan.   Australia will increasingly work through Vietnamese Government systems and will prioritise  rural  and  agricultural  development.  Total  ODA  to  Vietnam  in  2006-07  will  increase  to   $81.5 million.   

 South Asia and Pakistan  Development assistance to South Asia will increase to $124.3 million in 2006-07, reflecting  a significant increase in ODA to Pakistan to $17 million. Australia will also develop a larger  and more diverse regional programme in South Asia, increasing funding to $12.5 million in  2006-07. 

 Engagement  with  Pakistan  has  been  strengthened  following  the  October  2005  South  Asian   earthquake, with the aid programme providing $38 million in emergency relief assistance. In  addition, Australia has committed $40 million over three years for reconstruction assistance.  The bulk of this will be used for re-building education and health facilities. 

 Aid to Africa  Australia  will  continue  to  have  a  niche  role  in  Africa  and  total  assistance  will  increase  to   $82.1  million  in  2006-07.  Development  programmes  will  be  largely  delivered  through   multilateral and UN agencies. Australia will build on its strong humanitarian record in Africa,  funding HIV/AIDS prevention and care and providing support for vulnerable children.   

 Middle East and Central Asia  In  2006-07,  ODA  to  the  Palestinian  Territories  and  for  refugee  support  will  increase  to   $16.2 million. Australia will continue to work with the UN Relief and Works Agency and  NGOs to support delivery of essential services, development of local capacity, and activities  that reduce the vulnerability of Palestinians to poverty and conflict. 

 The  Government  is  providing  a  further  $22.5  million  to  Iraq  in  2006-07  as  part  of  its   reconstruction  programme.  Total  reconstruction  assistance  to  Iraq  since  2003  is  over   $170 million. Australia’s assistance will support Iraq’s transition to an open, market-based  economy. The aid programme will continue to focus on supporting strengthened governance  and building institutional capacity in key ministries and in niche areas where Australia has  particular expertise. 

 Australia will increase ODA to Afghanistan to an estimated $33.9 million in 2006-07. This is  part of an indicative Government commitment of $150 million over five years to support  Afghan nation-building efforts. Priorities will include supporting the delivery of essential  services through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, and democracy and capacity  building
