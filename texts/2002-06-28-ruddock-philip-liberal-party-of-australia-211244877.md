 Criminal Actions by Refugee Group Results in Woomera Escapes MPS 58/2002

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today that he was appalled and dismayed at criminal actions resulting in the breakout of rejected asylum seekers at the Woomera immigration detention facility.

 The Minister said a refugee supporter group claiming responsibility had committed serious criminal acts in helping the 35 people to escape last night.

 South Australian Police responded quickly with four escapees recaptured at Coober Pedy and one other recaptured in Woomera township.

 "This was not a spontaneous outpouring of support - it appears to have been a planned criminal activity," the Minister said.

 "Let's be clear, all of these people have been found not to be refugees by my department and in all but two cases that decision has been affirmed by the RRT.

 "Their claims have been carefully tested and all but two of these people have received a final answer on their merit claims and have taken these actions because it is not the answer they wanted."

 The Minister said 12 of the group had previously escaped and one had attempted escape.

 The group, all males, comprised 28 claimed Afghans, six Iranians and one Iraqi. The group included three minors.

 The incident occurred just before midnight last night. Information at this stage suggests that the perpetrators drove vehicles up to the perimeter fence of the centre where they assisted detainees to escape by throwing blankets over razor wire and providing cutting implements.

 The Minister said he would ask that the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in their investigations to particularly focus on a group that the ABC reported had claimed responsibility for the escapes in an email message.

 Mr Ruddock said he would ask the AFP to focus on tracking the perpetrators through messages sent to the ABC crowing about this criminal action.

 "The Government vows to use the full force of the law against the perpetrators of this crime. Aiding, abetting and harbouring escaped detainees are very serious offences that carry penalties of up to ten years jail.

 "These failed asylum seekers face up to five years in jail for their escape."

 118 people at the centre claim they are still not eating. Two male detainees have placed a single stitch in their lips.

 Prior to the escapes there were 215 people in the Woomera centre. Only seven of these people are awaiting a primary decision on their application for asylum.

 Eighteen are seeking review of a negative decision with the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT), six have had decisions from the RRT, 85 have claims before the courts and 99 are awaiting removal.                                                             28 June 2002
