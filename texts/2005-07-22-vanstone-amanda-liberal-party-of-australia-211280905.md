 Refugee and Humanitarian Program - Government Delivers on Helping  Those Most in Need 

 VPS 090/2005

 Minister for Immigration, Amanda Vanstone, announced today that the Government had fully delivered on its increased Refugee and Humanitarian  Program for 2004-05 by granting more than 13 100 visas.

 ‘This demonstrates the Government’s strong and continuing commitment to providing new lives for refugees and those in humanitarian need under  the Refugee and Humanitarian Program,’ the Minister said.

 ‘Ninety two percent, or 12 096 visas, were granted offshore in 2004-05, ensuring that the majority of our efforts target those in the greatest need of  resettlement, as determined by the United Nation’s High Commissioner for Refugees. This represents the largest offshore program since 1995-96.

 ‘The 50 per cent increase in the refugee component of the Program, from 4000 to 6000 places was fully delivered by the end of June. Most notable  was our ability to exceed our target of providing places in the Women at Risk program with 15.3 per cent of refugee places being granted in this  category - providing vital protection to vulnerable women and their families.

 ‘Australians can be justifiably proud that they support a Program that delivers resettlement to some of the world’s most vulnerable people, at a cost  of approximately $500 million per year.

 ‘The majority, about 70 per cent, of the offshore visas have been granted to people from Africa.

 ‘As I announced in May, the Government has reaffirmed its commitment to the increased Refugee and Humanitarian Program by continuing the  program at 13 000 new places for 2005-06 (6000 refugees and 7000 Special Humanitarian Program and protection visas).’
