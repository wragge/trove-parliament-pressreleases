 Senator Kay Patterson Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

 Joint Media Release with ACT Chief Minister Gary Humphries MLA 27 November 2000

 ACT Signs Agreement on Interpreting Services The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Kay Patterson, and the ACT Chief Minister, Gary Humphries, have signed an agreement which forges a closer relationship on interpreting services as part of the inaugural ACT Interpreting and Translating Awareness Day.

 The Interpreting and Translating Awareness Day consists of a series of workshops showing ACT Government employees how to best utilise interpreters to communicate with their non-English-speaking clients.

 The Memorandum of Understanding signed today formalises the interpreting arrangements that the Translating and Interpreting Service (TIS) - part of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) - and the ACT Government already have in place.

 "The agreement that we are signing today sets some very high and indeed impressive standards for the provision of interpreting services by the Commonwealth's Translating and Interpreting Service," Mr Humphries said.

 Senator Patterson said that since 1998, TIS had provided some 23,000 interpreting services to members of the ACT community through ACT Government agencies. This comprised 14,000 telephone interpreting tasks and 9,000 on-site interpreting visits.

 "We are keen to continuously improve the translating and interpreting service so that our 6,000 potential customers who cannot speak English are provided with the best possible opportunities to gain access to our services," Mr Humphries said.

 "TIS showed itself to be a world class service during the Olympic and Paralympic Games," Senator Patterson said. "TIS answered 92 per cent of all telephone calls within 30 seconds during the Games and supported SOCOG with over 1,500 interpreting services for Olympic Family members.

 "This world class service is the quality standard that TIS will be providing for the ACT Government. To ensure TIS continues to provide the highest standard of service possible, DIMA will spend $2 million on new telephone and computer technology in 2000-2001.

 TIS is a key migrant and refugee settlement program which annually performs around 190,000 telephone interpreting tasks, 75,000 face-to-face interpreting visits and 19,000 document translation tasks for government and non-government agencies to help them communicate with their clients.
