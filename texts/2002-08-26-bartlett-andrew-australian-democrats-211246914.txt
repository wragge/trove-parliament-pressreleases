 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 26 August 2002  MEDIA RELEASE 02/416

 AUSTRALIA ACKNOWLEDGES A DAY OF SHAME

 The Australian Democrats said that the Tampa episode should be remembered not only for the events of a year ago, but for the long-term consequences of a policy which refuses to allow people to set foot on Australian soil prior to their determination of refugee status.

 Australian Democrats Immigration spokesperson, Senator Bartlett said “ It was a disgrace then and it is a disgrace now.”

 “This government deliberately turned its back on Australia’s international obligations and took us down the most divisive and dangerous path in our history.  

 “For the first time in history the defence forces were used to execute government policy that was deliberately manipulated during an election period. The very nature of this policy ensured that the Navy kept vessels that were only 'marginally seaworthy' in the water.  It involved the Navy in a life and death game of brinkmanship with desperate people in leaky boats. It was in this arena that the dishonest and deliberate misrepresentation of events surrounding the SIEV 4 and the tragedy of the SIEV X were played out.

 “We now have a well know regime whereby thousands of refugees including children, are deprived of permanent status, held indefinitely in detention or on remote islands, torn apart from their families and unable to access basic settlement programs and services.  We have hundreds of accounts of the disintegration of the mental and physical health of refugees because of extended periods of detention and separation.

 “The government ignores any criticism no matter where it comes from.  Instead the Minister continues to vilify refugees and to use them to send a message to the electorate regardless of the personal damage this treatment is causing.

 “There is no doubt that these tragic circumstances came about because of the fear campaign run during an election. 

 “Australians must continue to fight to reverse the trail of human destruction which the Coalition’s policies continue to unleash,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
