 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 Government poised to send child to detention in  Nauru 

 Senator Nettle, 25th May 2006   

 Greens Immigration Spokesperson Senator Kerry Nettle has warned that any move to  send the Afghani family who has arrived on Thursday Island seeking asylum to Nauru  would represent the reintroduction of the policy of locking up children and be a  betrayal of the deal done with Coalition backbenchers last year to end this cruel  practice.    

 "The Immigration Department's stated intention to send this family of asylum seekers  to Nauru will put a 9 year old boy in detention and be a clear breach of Australia's  obligations under the UN Refugee Convention," Senator Nettle said.    

 "Australia can and should process their claims on the mainland whilst allowing then  to live in the community in the meantime.    

 "Afghanistan continues to be a very dangerous place where earlier this week at least  16 civilians were killed in Coalition bombing raids and an Australian soldier was  injured this week.  

 

 "To send this family to Nauru will bring further shame on Australia, cost the taxpayer  millions of dollars and only succeed in bringing more pain to this desperate family.    

 "The Minister must explain why it is in Australia's interest to pursue this bizarre and  cruel policy."
