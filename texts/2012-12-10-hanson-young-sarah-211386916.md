 MEDIA RELEASE

 Australia’s rights and wrongs highlighted on  Human Rights Day   

 Human rights groups in Australia are making themselves heard every day to the betterment of our  society, but the Australian Government needs to follow their lead if real change is to be achieved,  the Australian Greens said today.   

 “International Human Rights Day gives us all a chance to recognise the efforts of people around  Australia who work tirelessly to defend the rights of the less powerful,” the Greens’ Human Rights  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Today we recognise the work of people who are speaking up for the rights of Indigenous  Australians, caring for our disadvantaged youth, fighting for a safer and fairer world or campaigning  for the humane treatment of refugees.   

 “I welcome the recognition of the work of refugee activist Kon Karapanagiotidis OAM, who  established the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, and call on the Government to acknowledge its own  failings in the same area.   

 “Labor and Liberals’ race to the bottom is overshadowing the good work of people like Mr  Karapanagiotidis who is fighting for refugees’ rights while the Government dumps hundreds of  people, including families and children, in island prisons.   

 “The last ten years have seen significant wins and disappointing losses in the fight for the recognition  of human rights in Australia and it is important to remember that the moral test of any society is  how it treats its most vulnerable members.   

 “The inspiring work of many Australians who will be recognised today attests to the fact that we, as  a nation, have both a lot to be proud of and a long way to go.”
