 MANPOWER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES: AFFECTING MIGRANT AND  REFUGEE YOUTH TO BE REVIEWED

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,

 Mr John Hodges, today announced that a review of the  Commonwealth's manpower and training programs will be 

 undertaken to assess the extent to which they meet the  needs of migrant and refugee youth.

 The Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs has been  requested to carry out the review. It is an independent  Commonwealth statutory.authority which has among its  functions a major role in providing advice to the Common­

 wealth Government:on multicultural matters. .

 Mr Hodges said that the request for the study by the 

 Institute had been proposed by the Minister for Employment 

 and Industrial Relations, Mr Macphee, whose Department  administers the manpower and training schemes.

 "No date has yet been fixed.for the conclusion of the study, 

 but it is hoped that some findings may be available by 

 April;for consideration in the 1983-84 Budget context," .   Mr Hodges said.

 "The importance of such a study was highlighted by the 

 Institute's recent report, the Evaluation of Post-Arrival 

 Programs.and Services, which noted that the proportion of -  

 migrants participating in Commonwealth manpower and training  programs appeared to be very low, and identified youth 

 unemployment as an area of special concern."
