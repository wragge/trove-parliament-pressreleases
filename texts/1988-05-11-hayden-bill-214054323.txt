 Aid for A nti Piracy Program  in  Thailand

 Australia would make a contribution of $220 000 to the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Anti Piracy Program, for its operations  in 1988/89 in the Gulf of Thailand, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and  Trade, Mr Bill Hayden,M.P., announced today.

 Australia has been a major contributor to the Anti Piracy Program since it  began in 1982, providing funds totalling $1,906 million.

 Mr Hayden said the program was an important component of Australia's  overall assistance for Indo-Chinese refugees.

 The success of the program has been demonstrated by the decline in the  percentage of boats being attacked by pirates. This figure fell from 13 to 8  per cent in 1987 even though the number of boats arriving in Thailand rose  from 400 to 930 over the same period.

 The numbers of people arriving in Thailand rose dramatically in 1987 to  10 313, up from 4 392 in 1986.

 "The Anti Piracy program has helped to reduce the level of pirate attacks  and enabled the UNHCR to fulfil its protection responsibilities towards  Vietnamese seeking asylum," Mr Hayden said.

 An international review of the program's activities in 1987, with Australian  participation, recommended that it be extended for a further three years.

 Australia's response to the plight of refugees in Indo-China is part of the  Government's humanitarian aid program managed by the Australian  International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).
