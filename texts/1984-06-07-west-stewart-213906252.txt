 $75,950 IN GRANTS FOR MIGRANT SELF-HELP PROJECTS

 Project grants totalling $75,950 to 24 ethnic and community  organisations throughout Australia were announced today by the  Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affiars, Mr Stewart West.

 The grants are made under the Migrant Project Subsidy Scheme,  which provides once-only subsidies of up to $10,000 for projects  in the field of migrant welfare.

 The latest grants bring to 58 the total number of proejct grants  awarded in 1983/84, which are worth a total of $200,000.

 "A number of the applications I have just approved are for  innovative projects in^ areas of special need such as the migrant  aged, youth and isolated women", Mr West said.

 "These Projects have the potential to help ethnic communities  develop self-help programs, and improve migrants' access to  welfare services.

 "I am also pleased that a number of smaller and more recently  established communities have been assisted.  It is important  that a Scheme such as this is able to benefit groups which are  less likely to attract funding under other grant schemes", Mr West said.

 Attached is a list of the approved grants.
