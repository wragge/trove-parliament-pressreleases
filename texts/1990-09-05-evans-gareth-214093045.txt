 Australia provides $250,000 to assist in repatriating people stranded in M iddle Eastern countries

 Australia will provide $250,000 to assist in repatriating people stranded in  Middle Eastern countries, primarily in Jordan, the Minister for Foreign  Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, announced today.

 The funds will be channelled through the International Organisation of  Migration (IOM), and are additional to the $250,000 provided last week to  the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to assist refugees as  they cross the border into Jordan.

 "IOM is working to provide accelerated departure mechanisms, including  transport ships and charter aircraft, for the safe repatriation of foreign  nationals," Senator Evans said.

 "As the days pass, more and more refugees leave Iraq for neighbouring  countries. Stranded people face increasingly crowded and difficult  conditions."

 "An assessment team in Amman reports that citizens of Bangladesh, Sri  Lanka, Philippines and Pakistan are in greatest need of urgent repatriation,"  Senator Evans said. "It is appropriate for Australia to offer help to citizens  from our region during this especially difficult time."

 Australian emergency assistance to those stranded in Middle Eastern  countries is part of the Australian aid program, administered by the  Australian International Development Assistance Bureau.
