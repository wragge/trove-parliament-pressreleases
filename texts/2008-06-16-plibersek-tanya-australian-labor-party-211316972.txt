 Media Release 

 Government announces $2.1 million in grants to boost women's leadership and  advocacy 

 16/06/2008 

 The Australian Government is committed to developing and supporting women's leadership in  every aspect of Australian society.    

 Twenty-two national women's non-government organisations will share in $2.1 million in grant  funding as part of this year's Women's Leadership and Development Programme (WLDP).   

 The grant recipients, announced at the National Women's Secretariats Meeting at Broken Hill  today, will each receive up to $100,000.    

 Proposals were selected on their ability to:  

 â¢ promote women's social inclusion;   â¢ build women's capacity to take on greater leadership responsibilities;   â¢ build the capacity of women's non-government organisations to represent the views of their  members and contribute to the development of public policy and service delivery.  

 

 The Government is building a stronger and more dynamic program of engagement with women's  representative organisations to ensure women's perspectives and needs influence the  development of policies and programs in all areas of government, business and the community  sector.   

 Today's announcement builds on the Government's commitment to boost women's leadership and  advocacy and I congratulate each of the recipients for the outstanding work that they do.    

 Delivering on an election commitment, the Government will host a National Rural Women's Summit  in Canberra from June 26-28.    

 This Summit will identify and discuss the scope of issues affecting rural women and their  communities and consider recommendations to address these issues.   

 Following the Summit, the Government will consider options to strengthen the capacity of rural  women to participate in policy debate affecting their communities.
