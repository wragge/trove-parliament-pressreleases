 GOVERNMENT KICKS INTO PUBLIC APPEALS FOR RWANDA

 Minister for Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney, announced today that $1.75 million  o f the latest $6.5 million aid package for Rwanda would be distributed equally among the  seven public appeals currently raising funds for emergency relief efforts in Rwanda and border  regions.

 "The unprecedented humanitarian needs demand an urgent response from the Australian  Government. Australians have a tradition o f responding very generously to people in  desperate need and once again "compassion fatigue" has been proved a myth," M r Bilney said.

 "Australian non-government agencies have reacted quickly and effectively to the crisis in  Rwanda and I commend them for their motivation in raising such substantial amounts for the  refugees o f Rwanda.

 "I am pleased to announce that the Government will continue to support their efforts with  extra funds for their appeals. Each o f the following seven major aid organisations involved in  Rwanda relief operations will be given $250,000 from the $1.75 million for their public  appeals: Care Australia, Community Aid Abroad, Austcare, The UNICEF Committee of 

 Australia, World Vision Australia, The Australian Red Cross Society and Australian Catholic  Relief," M r Bilney said.

 The Minister said he was currently considering proposals for funding other specific relief  activities and would announce his decision on these proposals in the near future.

 Mr Bilney made the announcement at the opening o f a new Rwanda Information and Media  Liaison Centre in AIDAB's head office at 62 Northboume Ave, Canberra.
