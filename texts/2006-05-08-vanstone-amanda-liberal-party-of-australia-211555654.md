 Unauthorised Boat Arrival 

 8 May 2006 

 Three Indonesians from Papua province remain in detention after they were located at Boigu  Island in the Torres Strait, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone,  said today. 

 ‘The three men, who had travelled on a small unpowered native boat, were intercepted by  immigration officials at Boigu Island on May 6,’ Senator Vanstone said. 

 ‘Early indications are that they arrived from Papua New Guinea after having previously crossed  from the Papua province of Indonesia. 

 ‘They are currently on Horn Island and are in good health.’ 

 As they arrived on an excised place, they are classified as offshore entry people. 

 ‘If they were to seek protection, they will not be processed in Australia and are not entitled to  make any application under the Migration Act,’ Senator Vanstone said. 

 ‘As they arrived from PNG, which is party to the Refugees’ Convention, return options to PNG  first need to be explored. 

 ‘My department is currently working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in  relation to this option,’ the Minister added.
