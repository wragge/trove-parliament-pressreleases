 Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Scott Morrison 

 Illegal boat arrivals at lowest level in five years 

 Friday 3 January 2014 

 The latest weekly report for Operation Sovereign Borders confirms that the December  quarter in 2013 had the lowest number of illegal maritime arrivals to Australia in five years,  Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the Hon Scott Morrison said today. 

 From October to December 2013 there were 17 suspected illegal entry vessels with 901  illegal maritime arrivals. 

 This is the lowest level for these three months since October to December 2008, when there  were six boats with 149 illegal maritime arrivals, and it represents an 85% reduction on  arrivals during the same period in 2012 when more than 6,000 people turned up on over 100  boats. 

 In the latest reporting period there were once again no IMAs transferred to immigration  authorities from SIEVs. 

 In total throughout 2013 there were 300 suspected illegal entry vessels with 20,587 illegal  maritime arrivals - 92% of these arrivals turned up under the previous government prior to  the 7 September election. 

 The boats have not yet stopped, but they are stopping.  

 The right policies on our borders are now in the right hands and are consistently getting the  right results. 

 The Coalition Government has been able to sustain a more than 80% reduction in arrivals,  despite the difficult situation with Indonesia and weather conditions that have favoured the  smugglers. 

 Weather conditions have been favourable for voyages for the entire period including all of  December. 

 It took a Coalition Government that has consistently believed in strong border protection  policies to restore the full suite of Howard Government policies that were abolished by Labor  and the Greens that unleashed the chaos, cost and tragedy that plagued Labor's time in  government. 

 By contrast, Labor were dragged kicking and screaming to restore offshore processing and  the $1.2 billion funding black hole they left behind for Nauru and Manus Island exposed  Labor as just trying to fake it until they made it prior to the election.  

 Labor's decision to team up with the Greens after the election to unsuccessfully force the  Abbott Government to grant permanent visas to boat arrivals, by disallowing temporary  protection visas, shows Labor have learned nothing.
