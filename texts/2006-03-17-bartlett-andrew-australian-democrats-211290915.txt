 SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT  AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS DEPUTY LEADER  DEMOCRATS AGRICULTURE SPOKESPERSON 

 AWB DENIAL OF THE OBVIOUS SIGNALS A CRISIS IN OUR DEMOCRACY  The continuing revelations showing widespread knowledge about Iraqi oil-for-food kickbacks are  symptomatic of a much larger problem that is seriously harming our democracy, Democrat Deputy  Leader, Andrew Bartlett said today. 

 “Given the evidence that has come forward showing how much Government agencies, bureaucrats  and intelligence officials knew over such a long period, it is simply not possible that Ministers or  indeed the Prime Minister could have remained ignorant.” 

 “However, what is possible is that the Government may have ensured that it did not ‘officially’ know.    Former Defence Department Secretary Paul Barratt has described how advice received ‘informally’  could not only then be ignored if it was unfavourable, but could also be publicly denied to have ever  been provided.” 

 “This is not just a game of ‘gotcha’ or a search for a smoking gun.  These practices are widespread  and they are a serious breach of trust that corrupts our whole democracy.” 

 “Three parliamentary inquiries have looked into the matter of advice given by staff to Ministers.  They  revealed a pattern of behaviour in which advice that did not suit the politics of a situation or  contrasted in some way with the Government’s opinion was not only ignored but often also denied to  have been provided.” 

 “The regional rorts inquiry uncovered the fact that the Deputy Prime Minister’s office demanded the  re-writing of departmental advice because it did not suit the Government’s view.  The children  overboard inquiry showed that the Government ignored advice that children were not thrown  overboard because it was not written advice.” 

 “As recently as two weeks ago, the Prime Minister was still ignoring the evidence on children  overboard, claiming that refugees sank their own boat.  Denying the evidence or trying to diffuse one  falsehood by adding a new one does not make something the truth.” 

 “For democracy to function there must be open communication between the Government and the  public service and the Government and the people.”    

 “At best this is dishonesty at worst it is corruption.  Our democracy cannot survive in anything but  name unless these entrenched practices are overturned,” Senator Bartlett said.
