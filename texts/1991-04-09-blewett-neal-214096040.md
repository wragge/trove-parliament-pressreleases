 Australia will provide 500,000 dollars to the International  Committee for the Red Cross and 500,000 dollars to the UN for  emergency assistance to Kurdish refugees from the conflict in  Iraq, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Neal  Blewett, announced today.

 "The plight of Kurdish refugees fleeing Iraq to Iran and Turkey  is of grave concern," Dr Blewett said.

 "This is a major human tragedy affecting the lives of thousands  of men, women and children which demands an international  response," he said.

 This contribution to assist Kurdish refugees follows an earlier  contribution of one million dollars each to the International  Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Office of the United  Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator (UNDRO) to provide 

 assistance to the victims of the Gulf crisis, including  refugees.

 Australia has now contributed a total of six million dollars in  humanitarian aid to the region. These funds have been provided  to a range of organisations, including NGOs and the Palestinian  relief organisation, UNRWA.

 This latest Australian emergency relief package is part of the  Government's overseas development assistance program  administered by the Australian International Development  Assistance Bureau, AIDAB.
