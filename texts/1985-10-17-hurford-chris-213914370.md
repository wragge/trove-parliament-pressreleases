 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION   A N D  ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 CAMBODIAN FAMILY REUNION .

 Cambodians demonstrating outside Parliament today have been   concerned about the safety of r e l a t i v e s  l i v i n g  i l l e g a l l y  in  

 Khao-1-Dang refugee camp on the Thai-Cambodian border .

 My o f f i c e  has contacted Thailand and been advised t hat  the  

 i l l e g a l s  in Khao-I-Dang are in no danger.

 There is no suggestion t hat  i l l e g a l s  face death i f  detected by  

 the Thai a u t h o r i t i e s .

 Al l  t hat  such persons face i s ret urn to an evacuation s i t e  inside   Thailand which is under the care and prot ect i on of the United  

 Nations Border R e l i e f  Organisation ( UNBRO) and other

 - i nt er nat i onal  agencies.

 I have expressed before my deep sympathy f o r  the p l i g h t  of  

 Cambodian-born Aust ral i ans who are separated from t h e i r  immediate   fami 1i e s .

 As I announced in a press rel ease on 25 September 1985, we are   about to commence migration processing of Cambodians in camps on   the Thai-Cambodian border. .

 I have also i nst ruct ed my Department to explore the p o s s i b i l i t y   of special arrangements f or  f ami l y mi grati on from withi n  

 Cambodia.

 I t  is my obj ect i ve t hat  Cambodian-born Aust r al i ans,  as f a r  as  

 possi bl e,  have the same r i g ht s as other Aust r al i ans to be  

 reuni ted in t hi s country with t h e i r  f a m i l i e s .

 Pri or commitments prevented me meeting with a del egat i on of the   Cambodians t oday. .

 Nevertheless I have arranged an appointment f o r  them with a  

 senior s t a f f  member tomorrow. .
