 MEDIA RELEASE

 Senator Chris Evans Labor Senator for Western Australia Shadow Minister for Defence

  7 May 2002

 DEFENCE BUDGET COVER-UP

 The Government is deliberately avoiding scrutiny of its Defence funding in the lead up to next week’s Budget.

 “The Minister for Defence has refused to answer key questions over the cost of current Defence operations and what savings have been implemented to offset them,” said Senator Chris Evans, Defence Shadow Minister.

 “Answers to these questions have been locked in the Minister’s office and are now five weeks overdue

 “Without this information it is impossible to assess the adequacy of funding for Defence or the efficient management of its funds.

 “The Government is deliberately avoiding scrutiny and accountability on its Defence spending.

 “John Howard obviously has something to hide.  Having misled the public over Defence spending during the election the Government is trying to pull another swindle over Defence funding in 2002-03.

 “Reports today raise further issues, including the fact that Defence appears to be holding more than $310 million in cash during the year it was not purchasing enough ammunition and a stop was put on routine repairs and maintenance, even on the purchase of pens and paper.

 “It is unacceptable that the lives of our troops are being put at risk because of a shortage of ammunition in a year when Defence has $310 million in the bank.

 “During the election the Treasurer and Prime Minister repeatedly, and falsely, told the public the cost of deployment to the Middle East and the operation to deter unauthorised boat arrivals would be absorbed by Defence.

 “Less than a month after the election the new Minister for Defence was briefing journalists on the funding pressure Defence was under.

 “Three months after the election the Government admitted it would be providing $340 million in additional funding to Defence this year for those operations.

 “It appears that the Government was willing to mislead the public over the cost and impact of those operations during the campaign.

 “At the last Senate Estimates hearing the Minister for Defence refused to provide details on the full cost of the operations, the savings implemented in Defence to offset those costs and on what the $340 million would be used for.

 ”The answers to those questions were due over 5 weeks ago.  To date not one response has been provided.

 “Robert Hill’s promise to bring openness and transparency to the portfolio is proving to be hollow rhetoric, with the Minister willing to step in and gag Defence just like his predecessor, Peter Reith.

 “During the Senate Estimates hearing Defence confirmed that have detailed information on the costs of the deployments and operations.”

 The Minister for Defence should immediately answer the following questions:

 1. What is the full cost of the deployment to the Middle East and the operation to deter unauthorised boat arrivals?

 2. Was the Government aware of those costs during the election?

 3. What savings were implemented to offset the majority of those costs?

 4. Why is Defence being allowed to amass over $310 million in cash this year, while it fails to buy enough ammunition for troops?

 5. Why did the Government provide Defence with an additional $340 million for the operations when $255 million of this funding was not used and was just invested by Defence?
