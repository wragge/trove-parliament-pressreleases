 MEDIA RELEASE   

 MINISTER LIGHTS UP THE HIGHWAY... AGAIN   

 The Immigration Minister today confirmed that he would not immediately revoke the visas of 3  asylum seekers who had lied to a coronial inquest and who took part in a plan to sabotage the SIEV  36.   

 Immigration Minister Chris Evans today in question time, in response to a question from Senator  Gary Humphries, the Shadow Parliamentary Secretary representing the Shadow Minister for  Immigration and Citizenship in the Senate, conceded that he will continue to refuse to cancel visas of  people who lied, under oath, in the Northern Territory coronial inquest.   

 “The Minister’s decision sends an unfortunate signal to people smugglers that acts of sabotage and  perjury do not disqualify people from entry to Australia,” Senator Humphries said today.   

 “Squibbing this opportunity to send a tough signal to the people smugglers shows that this  government is more focused on spin and talk rather than making tough decisions.   

 “Quite clearly, s501 of the Migration Act gives the Minister the power to revoke such powers, yet he  is too gutless to do so.   

 “Kevin Rudd and Chris Evans are more interested in protecting themselves from accountability than  in making decisions and taking responsibility for the total farce that their borders protection policies  have become. 

 

 “This Government are the best friends that people smugglers have ever had,” Senator Humphries  concluded.
