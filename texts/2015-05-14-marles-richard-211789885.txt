 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 

 MEDIA RELEASE    

 CONCERNS GROW OVER THE ABBOTT GOVERNMENTâ€™S SECRET CAMBODIA  DEAL    

 

 Labor is aware of reports that four asylum seekers are currently in Darwin awaiting  transfer to Cambodia.     

 It is disappointing the Abbott Government refuses to provide any detail to the  Australian community on the circumstances surrounding this.    

 If the arrangement to resettle refugees from Nauru to Cambodia is such a good  arrangement why is the Abbott Government being so secretive about it?    

 It is completely unacceptable that the Immigration Minister continues to keep the  Australian public in the dark about his deal with Cambodia.    

 Labor is calling on Mr Dutton to provide further detail about what safeguards will be in  place to ensure the safety of any people resettled.
