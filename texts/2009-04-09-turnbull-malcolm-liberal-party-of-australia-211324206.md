 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 Today’s tragic increase in unemployment, which is the largest monthly increase since 1991,  underlines the fact that Kevin Rudd’s economic policies have failed. He said in December that his  cash splash would create 75,000 jobs. Since that time we have seen unemployment increase by well  over 130,000. We’ve seen unemployment in one month, nationally, go to 5.7 per cent and in this  state, in New South Wales, it has risen by a full one per cent. New South Wales’ economy is in  reverse and it demonstrates that the reckless economic policies of the Rudd Government are not  delivering jobs, they’re not delivering economic growth. Our economy is going backwards and  unemployment is rising.    

 The big difference between Kevin Rudd and the Coalition is that we are genuinely focussed on jobs.  Louise Markus and I have been here today talking with the local community, with business leaders,  small business people, representatives of local government about jobs. Around Australia we are  committed to promoting employment, and above all with our six point plan to support small business  and employment in small business, we are focussed on providing the support, the cash flow, the  energy that small business deserves to keep people in work and create more jobs. That is the big  difference between us and the Labor Party.    

 Labor is running this country into tens and tens of billions of dollars of debt. Not a day goes by  without some new extravagance, ill thought out, not thought through at all, un-costed. We’ve seen  $23 billion given away in cash handouts since December. It was said that it was going to promote  employment and create jobs, well it’s created nothing except an enormous debt that we will spend  many years, high taxes and high interest rates, paying off.

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Turnbull, what’s your response to the estimate by the Government that figures, that  unemployment would rise to 5.5 per cent by June, now that numbers, today’s figures exceeded that?   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 Well it demonstrates that the Government does not know where the economy is going. The  Government’s unemployment estimates have been way out. The unemployment is already above  where they said it would be by June and of course they made those estimates only in February, so it’s  not so long ago that they made those new estimates. They have been running up tens of billions of  dollars of debt on policies which are simply not effective. They are not creating jobs. Unemployment  is rising and rising rapidly. They are not supporting economic growth. The economy is going  backwards. Labor’s economic management has failed. We have the tragic trifecta which we always  get from Labor governments - more debt, more unemployment, more strikes.    

 QUESTION:   

 Some say that without the stimulus package that job rates would be worse. What do you say to that?   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 You’ve only got to look at Labor’s own estimates. When Labor announced its stimulus package back  in February it showed estimates of unemployment which were substantially lower then where we are  today already. So the fact is Labor set out its own economic plan and its plan has already been shown  to have failed.   

 QUESTION:   

 The Government’s also predicted last month that unemployment would reach seven per cent by June  next year. What’s your thoughts on that, they’ll stick to that number?   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 The Government itself is walking away from that estimate of seven per cent by June next year.  We’re already at 5.7. I think the reality is that unless the Government changes its economic policy,  stops running us into deeper and deeper debt on measures which are not creating jobs and not  supporting the economy, then unemployment will be well above seven per cent.    

 Now it’s not too late for the Government to change its mind and for the Government to get real and  recognise that what this country needs is carefully targeted measures, such as those we’ve proposed,  which will support small business, jobs, enterprise, employment; do all of those things that people  expect a well managed government to do, instead of the reckless spending we’re seeing from Mr  Rudd. So many dollars spent, so much debt incurred and no jobs created, only jobs lost.   

 QUESTION:   

 What will the Coalition be looking at doing to rebuild that surplus?   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:

 What this country needs is a government that has got a head for figures. At the moment we have a  Prime Minister with a head for headlines. Only the other day he announced that he was going to  spend $43 billion on a broadband network. But he acknowledges they don’t know whether it will  cost that much or more. They don’t have a business plan. They don’t know how many customers it  will have. They don’t know what prices people will have to pay. They’ve just reached out into the air  and plucked a big number out and said; that’s what they’re going to spend.    

 In December they sent out $10 billion in a cash splash. This month they’re sending out $13 billion.  They said those big numbers would create jobs - they’ve clearly created none - jobs are being lost.  The fact is we need a government, and we will have a government after the next election when I’m  Prime Minister, that will manage this country prudently, carefully, ensuring that every dollar of  taxpayers’ money is spent wisely and that we get the maximum bang for the taxpayer’s buck.    

 What we have at the moment is a Government with no head for figures and only a head for  headlines.    

 QUESTION:   

 On another issue, reports today show that another refugee boat cruised into Christmas Island  undetected, what’s your response to that?   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 We are very concerned at the rising levels of unlawful entries, of people smuggling. This is a most  pernicious trade, it’s a terrible trade. We don’t know how many people die in the attempt. It’s a trade  in human lives. Now the Government has changed our immigration rules in a way that we believe,  and I think it’s clear now, has sent a signal that Australia has become a softer touch or a soft touch  for illegal immigration, for people smuggling. This is a very dangerous development and we are very  concerned that the Government has been sending the wrong signals.   

 QUESTION:   

 On another issue, are you surprised that Joel Fitzgibbon today admitted that he hasn’t spoken to the  Prime Minister about the trips he received to China?   

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 I’m astonished. The Prime Minister is back in Australia. Well he didn’t have any excuse when he  was overseas obviously. It is incredible that we have all of these serious concerns about the  competence, the integrity of the Defence Minister, and the Prime Minister hasn’t taken the time to  speak to him. What does the Prime Minister think his job is if it isn’t to ensure that all of his senior  Ministers are discharging their duties competently and honestly. There are very real question marks  over Joel Fitzgibbon and the fact that the Prime Minister has not spoken to him shows that the Prime  Minister is neglecting the real issues in his hunt for headlines.   

 QUESTION:   

 On another issue, Royal North Shore Hospital’s been told to take down all Christian symbols from  its hospital Chapel. What’s your thoughts on that?

 MALCOLM TURNBULL:   

 Well this is unbelievable, this is political correctness gone mad. That decision should be reversed.    

 Thank you very much.
