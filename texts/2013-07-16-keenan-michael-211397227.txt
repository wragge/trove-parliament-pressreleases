 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling KEVIN 767 ARRIVES AS RUDD ON TRACK  TO SMASH GILLARD’S ILLEGAL ARRIVAL  RECORD July 16, 2013

 Two more illegal boats, with a total of 145 people on board including the latest, Kevin 767, come as Kevin Rudd is set to  smash Julia Gillard’s record for the biggest month for illegal boats on record, Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “Boat Kevin 767 has arrived as Labor’s border chaos just gets worse under Kevin Rudd. Two weeks into June and already  more than 2,100 people have arrived on illegal boats as arrivals head towards an unprecedented 4,000 for the month,” Mr  Morrison said.

 “Photo-ops, flying around on planes and having lots of talk is no substitute for implementing policies on our side of the  border to stop the boats. Kevin Rudd has point blank refused to implement these policies.

 “Three more years of Kevin Rudd means three more years of cost, chaos and tragedy on our borders and at current rates  of arrivals, over 100,000 more people arriving on boats in a further three year Labor term,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “Over 2,000 people on 23 boats have arrived illegally on Australia’s shores in the first two weeks of this  financial year alone.

 “An average of more than one hundred people has arrived illegally by boat every day since Kevin Rudd took over the  Prime Ministership.

 “No amount of talk can hide the fact that the people smuggling business is thriving thanks to Rudd’s decision to abolish  the proven border protection policies of the Howard Government.

 “As a result of his decision we have a Border Protection Command that is under resourced and overstretched, an  immigration detention network that is overflowing and billions of dollars of wasted tax payer money.

 “Kevin Rudd has no plan to stop the boats - Australia cannot afford another three years of Labor’s border protection  failures,” Mr Keenan said.
