 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - PARLIAMENT HOUSE,  CANBERRA,  THURSDAY, 19 FEBRUARY 2004   

 

 SUBJECT: Cost of detention on Manus Island   

 

 SMITH: Over night we see the Government’s so called ‘Pacific Solution’ go from  the extraordinary to the ridiculous.     

 In the Melbourne Age today we see Minister Vanstone confirming that Aladdin Sisalem,  the lone asylum seeker on Manus Island, has been given the run of the island.  Amanda  Vanstone’s saying it’s a responsibility of the Papua New Guinea Government.     

 If he’s been given the run of the island and it’s the responsibility of the Papua New  Guinea Government, why don’t we simply close the Manus Island Detention Centre and  pay his hotel bills.     

 We’ve seen in the last week confirmed at Senate Estimates that the cost of keeping  Aladdin Sisalem in Manus Island for the last six months has been $1.3 million.  The cost  of keeping the detention centre going in Manus Island for the last six months has been  $4.3 million.     

 The cost of keeping one person at Manus Island for the last six months has been the  equivalent of 50,000 GP Bulkbilled consultations or 2,000 senior Australians being on  the Age Pension for the same period.   

 We also saw at Senate Estimate the Government confirm that $170 million has been  spent on Manus Island and Nauru to date, with $470 million confirmed in the forward  estimates.     

 So we now have the Pacific Solution going from the extraordinary to the ridiculous.  The  Government should end the Pacific Solution and as I’ve said before, as soon as they say  they will end the Pacific Solution, we will respond favourably and positively to whatever  transitional arrangements they might suggest.   

 JOURNALIST: Senator Vanstone argues that the detention centre is being kept  open to be basically to be on standby.  What do you make of that sort of excuse?   

 

 SMITH: The argument that it’s there as a deterrent or there on standby is frankly a  complete nonsense.  We note that the boats have stopped, because firstly, Saddam  Hussein who was once a tyrant in Iraq is now a prisoner of war, the Taliban have  effectively been banished from many or most regions of Afghanistan.  That’s why the  boats have stopped coming.     

 As well, the boats have stopped coming, because after doing nothing for four or five year,  the Government finally sat down with our neighbours, in particular Indonesia, and  entered into agreements so far as secondary movements and people smuggling are  concerned.     

 I don’t think that the good folk in the coffee shops of Kabul or Istanbul are sitting there  saying we’re not proposing to come to Australia because there’s a lone fellow on Manus  Island.   

 JOURNALIST: How many are in Christmas Island at the moment?   

 SMITH: Christmas Island there are 50, at Nauru there are 277.   

 JOURNALIST: And it’s defensible to spend what ever is being spent there for 50  but not Nauru?   

 SMITH: As we have made clear, we will close Manus Island and Nauru.  We  would end the Pacific Solution.  We’ve also made it clear that we believe there is a role  for Christmas Island so far as detention and processing is concerned.  We would have  detention and processing facilities on Christmas Island.  I’m proposing in due course to  visit Christmas Island, to inspect the facilities there and to make a judgement about what  further facilities, if any, are required.   

 JOURNALIST: This guy on Manus island, what would Labor do with him?   

 SMITH: As is often the case with individuals who are left alone on Manus Island,  his position is not uncomplicated.  He claims refugee status on the basis of being a  Palestinian.  There is a dispute as to whether he is ultimately the responsibility of the  Australian Government and the Australian people, or the Papua New Guinea people.     

 He has a case running in the Federal Court as we speak, so he may well ultimately be  determined by the Federal Court.     

 The Minister, as I say, overnight has said that he is the responsibility of the Papua New  Guinea Government.  So far as his detention is concerned, rather than him currently being  detained at the Manus Island detention centre, Minister Vanstone has said overnight the  Papua New Guinea Government is happy for him to have the run of the island.  She  regards it as their responsibility.     

 So why we don’t close the detention centre, save the millions of dollars that’s currently  costing the Australian taxpayer and make a modest contribution to paying his hotel bills.     

 End
