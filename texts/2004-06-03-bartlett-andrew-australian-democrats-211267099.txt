 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/445 THURSDAY 3 JUNE 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS AND SPOKESPERSON FOR IMMIGRATION  Democrats Call On Gov't to Show Mercy to Iraqi Asylum Seekers The Australian Democrats are once again calling for the Government to grant freedom to all Iraqi asylum seekers who are currently languishing in immigration detention and for the thousands of refugees who are currently on temporary protection visas. Democrats Leader Senator Andrew Bartlett, who has twice visited detainees on Nauru, said Iraqi refugees who are currently watching the deterioration in Iraq are becoming increasingly anxious about their situation and for their families who remain in Iraq. There are currently approximately 400 Iraqis in Brisbane at the moment, many of whom remain on temporary protection visas. “They live in a state of limbo, unsure of their future, and unable to get on with their lives. “I urge the Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone, to grant them permanent protection visas. “As for the Iraqi’s held in detention on Nauru and in Baxter, these people cannot be sent back to their homeland but should not be kept locked up indefinitely because their country has become unsafe. "The situation in Iraq is not something which the Iraqi asylum seekers have control over.  The detainees are not criminals and they don't deserve to stay locked up in extreme isolation.   “Those on Nauru have already been detained for over two and a half years, those in Baxter for up to five years.  It could be that long again before Iraq is safe and secure and they should not have to stay locked up in the meantime". The Democrats once again voice their fierce opposition to Australia’s Immigration detention policy which is inhumane and in serious breach of UN conventions that Australia is a signatory to.
