 It is estimated that there  are more than 370,000 per­ sons 16 years of age and  over who are residentially  qualified (more than 3 years  residence in Australia) to  apply for the grant of  Australian citizenship but  have not done so at 31  October 1978, (the latest 

 date for which this in­ formation is available).  As  outlined below more than 90.000 Italians, nearly 50.000 Yugoslavs and Greeks 

 have not applied for Austral­ ian citizenship. C o u n t r y N u m b e r

 ”IN OTHER WORDS” From: MICK YOUNG m . p . Shadow M inister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs

 No.6. 1-7 June 1981. Journalists,   broadcasters and other individuals  should feel free to reproduce any  article. An acknowledgement is not  necessary,but would be appreciated.

 EdLtonlal

 The Government's bungling continues in Canberra as we witness  a series of extraordinary Liberal Party meetings to sort  out the numerous bugs in the Government's legislative program.  Without doubt the session which commenced in February has  been the most unproductive for many, many years. We now an­

 ticipate a "mad" rush of legislation over the next 4 or 5  days to conclude this Parliamentary sitting. The two air­ line arrangement, the Peacock affair, the Premiers Conference  fiasco, the threat by the Government Whip over the pre-selec­

 tion of the Member- for Wilmot, Mr Burr, have turned the Parl­ iament and the process of Government into a complete shambles.

 One of the side effects of these events, which for the most  part is completely overlooked, is the utter demoralisation  that has taken place amongst public servants. The Government  over the years led by the Prime Minister, continued their  attack on the Public Service and now, of course, they will be  expecting the senior members of the Service to be working 

 long hours, 7 days a week in order to extricate them from  their own bungling.

 The reward for the Public Servants for such loyalty to duty  will undoubtedly be a fresh attack on them by the Government  in the Budget Session. The 'work hard for promotion'  ethic

 which applied for so many years in the Public Service has  been completely destroyed by this Government's policy on  staff ceilings and opting out of traditional Government  responsibilities.

 PhilosopheAA o$ the Goa Lamp Ftiench By-eJLection Sign During the French elections,  the French Communist Party  took an extremely aggressive 

 attitude on nuclear energy.

 Although some people are  shocked by the Socialist vic­ tory, there were 8 by-electio­ ns held between November 1980

 They called opponents of nuc- and January 1981. The Social-lear energy 'philosophers of  the gas lamp'  and declared  that "French uranium is the  best in the world".

 in Cyprus. Their role is the  civil policing of the island  of Cyprus together with Brit­ ish, Canadian and Danish Army  personnel.

 The cost of maintaining the  20 man contingent in Cyprus  in 1979-80 has cost nearly  half a million dollars (or 

 to be precise, $491,019).

 More than 2,700 persons are  recorded as having arrived by  air in Australia between Nov­ ember 1979 and October 1980  without a visa although they

 I had dinner with the High  Commissioner from Cyprus, Mr  Moushoutas and his wife this  week. The High Commissioner 

 has just had China added to  his list of accreditations.

 Because of "defects" in the  Migration Act, no action was  taken against thase airlines.

 The Act is now amended and  since 1 July 1980, "infor­ mation has been laid against  one carrier" according to the  Minister for Immigration.

 eral's Department. A repres­ entative of the U.N.H.C.R.  also attends the meetings in  an advisory capacity.

 The the end of January 1980  the D.O.O.R.S. Committee  processed 588 cases of "Indo  Chinese Direct Boat Arrivals"  Of those 528 were approved 

 for refugee status and 60  rejected. The 60 cases not  approved for refugee status  have been granted resident 

 status on humanitarian grou­ nds.

 Ethnic Schooli

 According to the recently  released "Review of Multi­ cultural and Migrant Educ­ ation" by the Australian  Institute of Multicultural  Affairs, ethnic schools  have grown considerably over 

 the last 5 years.  Their  present enrolment stands at  97,500.

 The Review recommends that  for an interim period of 2  years a per capita grant of  $30 per pupil should be made 

 available to approved ethnic  school authorities.

 Age di&thibution ofa immigftyntA

 I thought that some of the mere  statistically minded people  might like to know the age  distribution of immigrants 

 settling in Australia. In 1979  some 9% of all arrivals were  in the 0 - 4  age category, 18% in 5 - 14, 29% in 15 - 24, 

 23% in 25 - 34, 10% in 35 - 44, 

 8% in 45 - 64 and 3% in the 

 65 age group. *

 Therefore the argument that  some people try to push that  immigrants become a burden  on our social security system  doesn't seem to hold up given 

 that 70% of all arrivals are  capable of entering the work­ force while an additional 27%  (the children) are potentially 

 capable of entering the work­ force.

 Ttaliayi pcnAionA in AuAtJualia According to official statis­ tics from Italy some 9094 pen­ sions are paid by Italian  authorities in Australia for  a total value of some A$14.5  million.

 Under the portability prov­ isions Australia is paying  some 2,400 pensions each year  in Italy.

 continue to increase bec­ ause of a more relaxed entry  policy."

 Personally, I believe this to  be of major importance in our  relations with those count­ ries .

 The Govennment "backtnack&" People throughout Australia  will be pleased to know that  a major decision taken by 

 the Razor Gang has been rev­ ersed. The Canberra merry-  go-round is not to be sold. The Australian economy will  be saved!

 I also have a feeling that  when the House rises next  week, certain other dec­ isions such as the sale 

 of Government factories  in Coburg and Bendigo will  be reversed and they are not  decisions trtiich the Government  will hand out too many press 

 releases about,

 Many O^ences Againtt The  Migration Act.

 According to the Annual Report  of the Australian Federal  Police in 1979-80, one of  the highest number of off­

 ences were those reported  against the Migration Act.

 There were 1,723 offences re­ ported (an increase of 16%  compared to the previous  year).  This was second only  to stealing 1,868 (+1%), and  more than double of offences

 against the Commonwealth Elec­ toral Act 540 (+ 26%) on tra­ ffic offences 456 (+ 37%).

 A tnip to Rhoduia

 In the Prime Minister’s am­ azing statement to send Minis­ ters and backbenchers over­ seas to deliver invitations 

 to the Commonwealth Heads of  Government meeting, he includ­ ed the name of the Member for  Bradfield, David Miles Conn­ olly, HP. It is to be hoped  that Mr Fraser does not send  Mr Connolly to Zimbabwe as  before independence, Mr Conn­

 olly, in defiance of a United  Nations declaration, was a  guest of the former Ian Smith 

 regime in Rhodesia.

 Italy and Greece Ignored Although the largest non-  English speaking groups in  Australia are from Italy and  Greece, the International Ed­ ucation Branch of the Depart­ ment of Education had no con­

 tact with these countries in  1979-80.

 The International Branch be­ sides advising the Department  of Foreign Affairs on partic­ ipation in education at the  international level also ad­ ministers schemes of academic 

 awards and exchanges between  Australia and other countries.

 Last year the International-  Branch advised on educational  aspects with countries such .

 A new balance o& powe/i

 As the next session of Parl­ iament will be the first in  which the Government will not  have a majority in both  Houses, it should prove to be 

 the most interesting. Firstly,  we will have to wait and see  whether the Democrats who  will have the balance of power According to the Review the Dep-  have common policy on import- artment has acknowledged the

 need for a revised Teachers  Manual and although a consid­ erable amount of money and time  went into the existing ones,  

 they are going to "reorganise  them".

 erials, the Institute comm­ issioned Professor Kaplan froiiz  the University of Southern  California and Professor Poole  from Macquarie University.

 Professor Kaplan said that "the  text seems uncertain whether  it is going to be a schol­ arly treatise on testing or  a simple set of guidelines for  classroom teachers; consequent­ ly, it is neither".

 The recently released "Rev­ iew of On-Arrival Education  Program" by the Institute of  Multicultural Affairs is a 

 glaring indictment of the  Education Branch of the Dep­ artment of Immigration and  Ethnic. Affairs.

 In reading the Review, one  gets the. impression that  'there is a complete disarray  and lack of co-ordination in

 and Ethnic Affairs.

 under strong criticism, A few  quotes will suffice to illus­ trate this point.

 "The States frequently thought  that there was no consult­ ation and discussion, Committ­ ees have been used by D.I.E.A.  as simply a. means of informing  them of program changes".

 "The DIEA has been unable to  develop a system of data coll­ ection based on individual  student records".

 "Administrative decision-mak­ ing was too centralised in the  Central Office of D.I.E.A.

 5,

 (and) Departmental control  extended to very minor matt­ ers".

 "Regional D.I.E.A. offices  have lacked sufficient and '   suitably qualified staff".

 The Review is not very fav­ ourable about the financial  arrangements between the D.I.  E.A. and the States es­ pecially in the area of  allocating funds for the  education of newly arr­ ived immigrants.

 Language, programmes ^or  Refugee Children

 Education authorities have  received $2.7 million from  the Contingency Fund in 1980  to organise special language 

 programs for 6,000 children.

 The program enabled 235  teachers and teacher aids  to be employed in 1980 be­ cause most of the funds were  spent in staff salaries.

 Each newly arrived refugee  child 4s entitled to up to  six months assistance under  the contingency program.

 $11.6 million &or A£ri.can  re\{ugees.

 At the beginning of april this  year some $560 m. was pledged  by 44 donor countries for the  assistance of refugees in  Africa.

 Australia was the ninth larg­

 est contributor with $11.6 m.

 The U.S.A. contributed $285  milliont  the E.E.C $68 mil,  Germany $34.5 mil, Japan  $33mil, Saudi Arabia $30 mil, 

 Canada $18.8 mil, Italy  $17 mil, U.K. $13.8 mil, New  Zealand $187,000, even Cyprus  gave $3,000.

 Migrant and multicultural  education

 The Migrant education prog­ ram of the Schools Comm­ ission in 1980 has received  $3 million. An additional  $1.5 million was provided for  multicultural education.

 The money was given to the  Multicultural Education Prog­ ram, to the Curriculum Dev­ elopment Centre and the Ed­

 ucation Research and Devel­ opment Committee.

 These funds were provided to  the Schools Commission under  the Galbally Report's rec­ ommendations. The question  of course is what will happen 

 to these programs when the  Galbally money has dried up?

 V.O.O.R.S. Committee.

 country as refugees (includ­ ing the "boat people" from  Vietnam).

 Fund raiding or Mitterand I was interested to read in  the aftermath of the French  elections in which the Social  ist Party had the great vic­ tory under the leadership of  Francois Mitterand, that  among the people that Mitt­ erand had- on his staff was  a chap called Andre Rousselet  who specialised in fund-rais­

 ing among left wing business­ men.

 I was wondering how long it  would be before the Labor  Party would require such a  person in Australia.

 And What’Î» That?

 The 1979-80 Report of the  Commissioner for Community  Relations contains a curious  statement on page 99. It  states that: "The solution  to the white problems lies  with the white governments 

 and white bureaucracies; the  answer to black problems lies  with the power that oppressed  the Aborigines in the first 

 place."

 I might report them to A1  Grassby.

 Liberals Resign

 The resignations of John  Mason and Dick Hamer as the  respective leaders of the  Liberal Party in Australia's 

 two largest States, combined  with tue bungling that has  been going on in Canberra,

 reflects the vacuum that the  Liberal Party in Australia is  operating as far as policies?  are concerned. The destab­ ilising impact of these resig­ nations must be of great con­

 cern to the Prime Minister.

 The pressures that were built  up within the various State  branches to bring about the  resignations are also a good 

 sign of the tactics that will  have to be adopted by the  opponents of Malcolm Fraser in  Canberra. I have not changed  my mind from the prediction I  made two issues ago that Mal­

 colm Fraser will not lead the  Liberal Party to the 1983 el­ ections. He may think he is  indispensable but as Ben Chif- 

 ley once said, "the cemetery  is full of indispensable peop­ le".

 Nearly 10,000 foreign .students

 In 1980 some 9,155 foreign  students in Australia, mostly  coming from Malaysia, Hong  Kong, Indonesia, Thailand and 

 Singapore, were enrolled in a  variety of courses at all educ­ ational levels.

 Of these, 133 were referred to  the Department of Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs with the  advice that their stay in Aus­

 tralia was no longer justified  on educational grounds.

 According to the Department of  Education's "Annual Report  1980" "the total number of over­ seas students in Australia will
