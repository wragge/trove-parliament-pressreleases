 TONY ABBOTT:     

 It’s great to be here at Julie Bishop’s office. I want to thank Julie for hosting me at this marvellous gathering  and I want to thank her for the opportunity to talk to a very influential group of Western Australian business  people. Obviously, it’s absolutely critical that we do what we can to reduce the cost of living pressures on  families, on households. That’s why I am so keen - as well as getting rid of unnecessary taxes like the  carbon tax - to introduce a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme and to try to ensure that the families of  Australia have a child care system which reflects the economic realities that the modern Australian family  faces.    

 Once upon a time, we had a nine to five economy and in those days an eight to six child care system coped  pretty well. These days we have a 24/7 economy and that’s why we need to have a child care system that  better reflects that reality. Families come in all shapes and sizes. Jobs come in all different shapes and sizes.  So our child care system has to come in all different shapes and sizes if it’s to cater for the modern  Australian workforce; if it’s to cater for the modern family and the modern woman.    

 Just a couple of other subjects that I want to touch on. Look, this is a government which has totally lost  control of our borders. If you can’t control our borders, you can’t run the country. The government today is  boasting that some 18 people have been sent to Manus Island. Well, what about the 30,000-plus illegal boat  arrivals who have come to this great big island since this government changed the policy that’s working? It’s  just not good enough that this government thinks it’s an achievement to send just 18 people to Manus, when  you’ve got 2,000 people coming every month and the number is growing every day.    

 Finally, we’ve got evidence today that not only is this government bad for private health insurance, it’s bad  for Medicare, too. It really is disgraceful that a cash-strapped government which is spending money hand  over fist on things that shouldn’t be happening like border protection blowouts, now lacks the money to  ensure decent cancer treatment for people who are seriously ill. Now, if we had responsible economic  management, if we had competent and trustworthy government, there would be far less pressure on the

 Budget and we wouldn’t need the kind of cuts we’re now seeing in cancer treatment right around our  country.    

 I’m going to ask Julie Bishop to say a few words and then I’ll take some questions.    

 JULIE BISHOP:    

 I want to thank Tony Abbott for coming to my electorate office today. Tony is a frequent and welcome  visitor to Western Australia and there were a number of women in my electorate who wanted to meet Tony.  They are female community leaders, women business operators, and they wanted to meet with the Leader of  the Opposition to discuss issues with him so I’m delighted that Tony has been able to visit my electorate  office and meet so many business women, business leaders in Western Australia.     

 They have been telling me for some time that this government is making it harder to run a small business in  this state not easier; that the burden of regulation, the additional taxes, is making it harder for people to take  the risks to grow businesses that create the wealth and the job opportunities for all Western Australians, but  not only is this government incompetent, it is also dishonest and I understand that today, Ralph Blewitt - the  former union official who has admitted to taking part in a massive fraud perpetrated by the Prime Minister’s  former boyfriend Bruce Wilson against the Australian Workers’ Union - is in Australia and is prepared to  make a statement to the police confessing to his role in this massive fraud. I understand that Ralph Blewitt  wants to clear his conscience and tell the police what actually occurred when hundreds of thousands of  dollars of union funds went missing via the work of Bruce Wilson and Mr Blewitt. If Mr Blewitt is prepared  to clear the air and tell the Australian people about his role in this fraud, so should Prime Minister Julia  Gillard honestly and directly answer legitimate questions about what she knew and her involvement in this  massive fraud. This goes to not only the Prime Minister’s professional and ethical conduct at the time, but it  goes to her integrity and her honesty today as I believe her answers at press conferences have been less than  honest and have misled the Australian people about her true involvement. This is the opportunity for the  Prime Minister to admit to the Australian people what role she had to play in what turned out to be a  massive fraud perpetrated against the AWU.     

 QUESTION:    

 So are you saying that the Prime Minister is hiding something?    

 JULIE BISHOP:    

 The Prime Minister has been less than honest in her answers to legitimate questions asked by not only the  press but questions asked in the Parliament. She’s not answered questions that - if she’d done nothing wrong  - she should have found easy to answer. The Prime Minister insists she’s done nothing wrong; then she  should be happy to answer legitimate questions about her role.     

 QUESTION:    

 Are you alleging that she’s misled Parliament?    

 JULIE BISHOP:    

 I’m alleging that she’s been less than honest with answers that she has given to the press and the answers  that she has given in Parliament will be the subject of further scrutiny next week.    

 QUESTION:    

 In what forum would you call on the Prime Minister to answer these questions and would the Opposition  take any moves to call her in Parliament to make a statement?

 JULIE BISHOP:    

 The Prime Minister should give a full explanation to the Parliament. We’ve been calling on her for some  time to give a full and frank explanation to the Parliament and I can assure the Prime Minister there will be  an opportunity next week for her to answer legitimate questions about her role in what turned out to be a  massive fraud against the AWU.    

 QUESTION:    

 Would you be prepared to talk to Mr Blewitt about what he knows now that he’s in Australia?    

 JULIE BISHOP:    

 I understand Mr Blewitt has lawyers acting for him and that he has agreed to give a statement to the police. I  believe we should allow Mr Blewitt to get legal advice and then to make statements to the police, because of  course this has the potential to incriminate him, but he’s prepared to come back to Australia and tell what he  knows about this massive fraud. Clearly it’s been weighing on his conscience. I call on the Prime Minister to  likewise make a full statement to the Australian Parliament about what she knows in relation to this matter  and indeed answer the questions that I asked her in the Parliament. That would be a very good start.    

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, you must welcome this development with the AWU?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, I do think it’s important for people to be upfront and open about these events and, as Julie has said,  the Prime Minister has been stonewalling consistently on this. Now, I think the Australian people want to  give the Prime Minister the benefit of the doubt, but we’ve got to hear her side of the story before we can do  that and at the moment all we get is consistent stonewalling and that’s why there is this impression that she  has been less than frank, less than candid, less than open with the people and it’s feeding in to the sleaze  factor that surrounds the Labor Party more generally.     

 We’re seeing shocking revelations coming out of the ICAC hearings in New South Wales - and that’s not  just me speaking, that’s Kevin Rudd speaking, who said on Q&A earlier in the week that the whole future of  the Labor Party could depend on cleaning these matters up - and let’s never forget that the Sussex Street  machine which gave us Eddie Obeid, which gave us Ian MacDonald, which gave us the stinking patronage  culture that really did sour things in New South Wales under the former Labor government there; that same  Sussex Street machine was the source of the political assassination of Kevin Rudd and it is now sustaining  the current government in Canberra. So, I can understand why a lot of decent honest Labor people want their  own party to clean up its act.    

 QUESTION:    

 You are visiting one of the big mining states. Today, Rob Oakeshott has called on the mining tax as  unsustainable and that he believes it should be tinkered with. Short of scrapping the tax which you’ve  assured the Australian public you’ll do if you took government, is there any room for negotiation in your  eyes? Will the Coalition come to any room for negotiation on the mining tax so it will bring revenue in and  become sustainable?    

 TONY ABBOTT:

 This is a bad tax. Full stop. End of story. It’s a bad tax. The last thing you should do if you want to boost the  general economy is slug the strongest part of the economy. You don’t speed up the slow lane by slowing  down the fast lane. It was always a bad idea. It always will be a bad idea and that’s why we’re not going to  change it, we’re going to scrap it.     

 But it’s interesting that you should raise Mr Oakeshott, because Mr Oakeshott has never seen a tax that he  didn’t want to increase and I invite Rob to go and talk candidly to the people of his electorate about his plans  to increase the GST, about his plans to increase the mining tax and he should then explain to the people of  his electorate why it is that he is still propping up a government which is so incompetent that it has  introduced a new tax which hasn’t actually raised any revenue. Now, really, it takes a special kind of  political genius to bring in a confidence and investment destroying new tax that doesn’t actually raise any  revenue. Why is Rob Oakeshott propping up these people?     

 QUESTION:    

 Mr Abbott, do you not support the transfers to Manus Island?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I’m all in favour of vigorous offshore processing but if it’s going to work, it’s got to involve all of the people  who are coming illegally to this country, not just a handful. Eighteen people in Manus Island, that is a tiny  handful of the 2,000-plus that are coming every month now. This government doesn’t have its heart in it and  for this government to say "oh, look at the 18 that have gone to Manus" when you’ve got 2,000 plus coming  every month demonstrates that they just don’t get it.    

 QUESTION:    

 Are you concerned about Amnesty’s assessment of the conditions on Nauru as completely unacceptable?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I’m confident that any overseas processing centres or detention centres which the Australian Government is  helping to supervise would be run fairly and humanely. But I also have to say that people who come illegally  to this country can’t expect to be treated like they’re staying in a four star or five star hotel. The people who  have come illegally to this country need to know that they are breaking our laws, that they are, if I may say  so, taking advantage, unfair advantage, of our decency as a people. There need to be consequences for  people who do the wrong thing and that’s what rigorous offshore processing is all about.    

 QUESTION:    

 How are they breaking the law?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 It is illegal to come to Australia without papers, without proper documentation, without adhering to the  normal requirements that we expect of people coming to this country.    

 QUESTION:    

 Towing the boats back failed bitterly. It caused fires, sinking of boats. What makes you think that won’t  happen here?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 5 

 

 It has been done before, it can be done again.    

 QUESTION:    

 They abandoned it, though, because of the danger and loss of lives.    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 It happened successfully under the Howard Government. What’s been successfully done before, can  successfully be done again and I think it comes very ill of the current government to suggest that the Navy is  less professional today than it was a decade ago. If the Navy was sufficiently professional to do these things  a decade ago, it is more than sufficiently professional to do it again.    

 QUESTION:    

 They didn’t tow boats, though?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Boats were turned around. They were successfully turned around.    

 QUESTION:    

 Should Mr Blewitt be immune from prosecution over what he’s prepared to testify?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, that’s a matter for the police and for the prosecuting authorities.    

 QUESTION:    

 The front page of the Financial Review today has a call from business leaders for a rethink of the  relationship between business and government. If you were Prime Minister what would you be doing to  reset that relationship?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I have already announced that there will be a Prime Minister’s Business Advisory Council that will be  headed up by Maurice Newman, the former boss of Deutsche Bank here in Australia and the former head of  the Australian Stock Exchange as well as being a former chairman of the ABC. It is very important that  there should be regular, candid and full dialogue between business and the government; not because  government’s job is to do whatever business wants, but because government’s job is to ensure that business  has a climate in which it can prosper because we won’t have more jobs, we won’t have higher wages, we  won’t have better-off families unless we have successful competitive businesses and that’s what the next  Coalition government is determined to ensure.     

 Thank you.
