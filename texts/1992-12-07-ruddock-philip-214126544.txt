 LAY OFF THE MESSENGERS -  ITS THE GOVERNMENT THATâ€™S FAILED

 Minister Gerry Hand should accept that his 3-year failure to address the  refugee crisis and to contain the ambit of judicial review has brought about  the present crisis in immigration policy.

 He should lay off individual judges, the legal profession and voluntary  agencies. Their criticisms of government policy are a symptom, not the cause  and they cannot be held as scapegoats for the fact that over 400 asylum  seekers have been held in detention, many for in excess of three years.

 They cannot be held responsible for the fact that we have more than 70,000  illegal entrants. They cannot be held responsible for the fact that we have  more than 20,000 unresolved asylum claims. They cannot be held responsible  for the more than 20,000 people from the Peoples Republic of China in  Australia on special 4-year temporary entry permits whose residency status 

 remains unresolved.

 The Minister's arguments should be mounted from first principles, and not  related to individuals.

 It is the Government of the day which is responsible for determining who  shall and shall not enter Australia for permanent settlement, not the courts,  which have merely a judicial function to interpret the law.

 Proper criticism of the courts would be of their creative law-making role in  the immigration area. The extension of the ambit of a limited ministerial  discretion in S.6(a)l(e) of the Migration Act 1958, to assist those  demonstrating strong and compelling compassionate or humanitarian need  to remain in Australia by the courts, was the root cause for so many people  entering Australia in expectation that they would achieve permanent  residency.

 The Parliament anticipated that only several hundred people would be  captured by this regulation. However the court's interpretation meant that  a torrent of over 14,000 applicants were received in 1989-90. The Act was  subsequently amended, but not before the proverbial horse had bolted.

 Likewise creative law making in relation to refugee entry, which was always  seen as properly the role for Parliament and the administration, always had  the potential for abuse.

 The Coalition has warned, counselled and advised the Government to make  fundamental changes in each of these areas to specify clearly the law and to  circumscribe judicial law making in this area of policy.

 It is now only 3 years later that such legislation is before the Parliament.

 It is the Government that is to blame, not the actions of those who counsel,  advise and deliberate on the basis of the law that the government has left  in place.
