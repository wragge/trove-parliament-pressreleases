  OFFICE OF THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

  

 TRANSCRIPTION: PROOF COPY E&OE

  

 DATE: 24 MARCH 1999

  

 VENUE: PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA

  

  TITLE: KOSOVO & GREENPEACE ACTIVISTS

  

  MR DOWNER:

  

 CAN I MAKE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE NATO DECISION TO 
AUTHORISE AIR STRIKES AGAINST PRESIDENT MILOSEVIC’S FORCES. THE AUSTRALIAN 
GOVERNMENT REGRETS VERY MUCH THAT PRESIDENT MILOSEVIC’S FURTHER INTRANSIGENCE 
HAS BROUGHT ABOUT AN AUTHORIZATION BY NATO OF AIR STRIKES. THE AUSTRALIAN 
GOVERNMENT NEVERTHELESS GIVES OUR SUPPORT TO THE NATO ACTION WE UNDERSTAND 
THE NEED FOR THIS ACTION.

 THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS TRAGIC SITUATION LIES 
SQUARELY WITH MR MILOSEVIC AND WITH HIS GOVERNMENT AND HIS FORCES. AT 
EVERY STAGE THEY HAVE SIMPLY THWARTED PEACE EFFORTS. THEY HAVE REJECTED 
THE RAMBOUILLET PEACE ACCORD. THEY VIOLATED THE OCTOBER AGREEMENT WITH 
ATROCITIES AGAINST KOSOVO CIVILIANS. THEY HAVE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
SOME 20,000 REFUGEES AND 200,000 DISPLACED PERSONS. WE VERY MUCH HOPE 
AND WOULD URGE PRESIDENT MILOSEVIC AT THIS LAST MINUTE TO SIGN UP TO 
THE RAMBOUILLET ACCORD, TO CHANGE HIS POSITION VERY SUBSTANTIALLY BECAUSE 
OTHERWISE AND THIS IS PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT THE NATO AIR ATTACKS WILL 
TAKE PLACE.

  

  QUESTION:

  

 PRESUMABLY NO AUSTRALIAN INVOLVEMENT AT ALL IN THIS?

  

  MR DOWNER:

  

 WE HAVE NO MILITARY INVOLVEMENT. WE ARE PROVIDING 
OUR DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT. WE ARE PROVIDING VERY STRONG DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT 
FOR THE NATO ACTION. THERE ARE NO AUSTRALIAN FORCES INVOLVED ALTHOUGH 
THERE MAY BE A VERY SMALL NUMBER, WE ARE TALKING OF LESS THAN 10, AUSTRALIANS 
WHO ARE SECONDED TO AMERICAN AND BRITISH UNITS WHO POTENTIALLY COULD 
BE INVOLVED IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THEM 
BEING INVOLVED. ALL AUSTRALIANS IN YUGOSLAVIA HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT 
THEY SHOULD LEAVE. THERE ARE SOMETHING LIKE 5,000 AUSTRALIANS IN YUGOSLAVIA. 
MANY OF THEM ARE DUAL NATIONALS, MANY OF THEM HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT 
THEY DON’T WANT TO LEAVE BUT WE HAVE ADVISED THEM TO LEAVE AS YOU 
KNOW WE HAVE MOVED OUR DIPLOMATIC STAFF OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND WE HAVE 
DONE THAT IN A PATTERN WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH JUST ABOUT ALL OTHER 
EMBASSIES IN BELGRADE.

  

  QUESTION:

  

 DO YOU EXPECT THE AIR STRIKES TO IN AUDIBLE ?

  

  MR DOWNER:

  

 WELL IF IT COMES TO AIR STRIKES, AND AS TRAGIC AS 
THAT WOULD BE, PRESIDENT MILOSEVIC WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM AND 
THOSE AIR STRIKES WILL NEED TO BE EFFECTIVE. ONE OF THE DEFINITIONS 
OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS WILL BE THE SUBSEQUENT CAPACITY OF PRESIDENT 
MILOSEVIC TO CONTINUE TO USE FORCES IN THE WAY HE HAS BEEN USING AGAINST 
THE KOSOVO PEOPLE. IF THESE STRIKES ARE EFFECTIVE THEN HIS FORCES WILL 
BE SUFFICIENTLY DEGRADED, BUT THEY WON’T BE ABLE TO MOUNT THE SORT 
OF OPERATION THAT THEY HAVE BEEN MOUNTING IN KOSOVO.

  

  QUESTION:

  

 HOW EFFECTIVE THOUGH IS CRUISE MISSILE DIPLOMACY BEEN 
GIVEN THE EFFECTS IN IRAQ AND IRAN AND AFGHANISTAN, WHAT DOES IT DO 
OTHER THAN GIVE THE WEST SOME LOW COST OPTIONS?

  

  MR DOWNER:

  

 WELL I WOULDN’T PUT IT AS LOW COST OPTIONS. I THINK 
BY THE WAY THERE ARE VERY SUBSTANTIAL RISKS INVOLVED IN THIS PARTICULAR 
EXERCISE. THERE ISN’T ANY DOUBT THAT THE SERBIAN DEFENCE FORCE HAS 
A MUCH BETTER ANTI AIRCRAFT CAPABILITY THAN IRAQ HAD. I WOULD ALSO SAY 
THAT THESE SORTS OF EXERCISES CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN THE CASE OF IRAQ THE 
IRAQI MILITARY WHERE SUBSTANTIALLY WEAKENED AND SO WAS THEIR CAPACITY 
TO DEVELOP WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE EFFECTIVE 
TARGETING AND AN EFFECTIVE OPERATION COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE 
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SERBIAN ARMY AND ITS CAPACITY TO UNDERTAKE THE 
SORT OF OPERATIONS ITS BEEN RECENTLY UNDERTAKING IN KOSOVO. SO, THESE 
SORT OF OPERATIONS CAN BE SUCCESSFUL AT THE END OF THE DAY NATO HAS 
LAID DOWN CONDITIONS TO PRESIDENT MILOSEVIC. HE HAS SO FAR FAILED TO 
MEET THOSE CONDITIONS. NATO CAN’T SIMPLY TAKE THE POSITION THAT IT 
WILL WALK AWAY FROM THE THREATS THAT IT HAS MADE. I MEAN ONE THING IN 
ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT, IS WHAT 
ARE THE ALTERNATIVES? HOW ATTRACTIVE WOULD IT BE FOR NATO TO TURN ITS 
BACK ON WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN KOSOVO. AND WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPLICATIONS 
FOR THE REST OF THE BALKANS IF NATO SIMPLY TOOK THE VIEW THAT SHOULDN’T 
TAKE STRONG ACTION IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE? SO THEY WERE LEFT WITH 
NO ALTERNATIVE AND IF IT DOES COME TO THAT WE HOPE THAT THEY WILL BE 
EFFECTIVE.

  

  QUESTION:

  

 ON ANOTHER ISSUE, AUSTRALIAN GREENPEACE PROTESTERS 
WHO ARE BEING DETAINED IN JAPAN HAVE ASKED AUSTRALIA FOR SOME ASSISTANCE, 
HAVE YOU OFFERED THEM ANY ASSISTANCE AND DO YOU INTEND TO?

  

  MR DOWNER:

  

  OUR EMBASSY IN TOKYO WILL OFFER THESE PEOPLE TH E USUAL CONSULAR 
ASSISTANCE THAT WE WOULD OFFER TO ANY OTHER AUSTRALIAN IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES. 
ANY AUSTRALIANS WHO ARE DETAINED WE OFFER CONSULAR ASSISTANCE TO. JUST 
BECAUSE THEIR MEMBERS OF GREENPEACE DOESN’T MEAN THAT THEY GET ANY 
PRIVILEGED ASSISTANCE.

  

  QUESTION:

  

 THEY HAVEN’T BEEN CHARGED YET, IS IT APPROPRIATE 
THAT THEY BE DETAINED SINCE THURSDAY?

  

  MR DOWNER:

  

 WELL, I’M NOT SURE OF THE PRECISE DETAILS OF THE 
OPERATION OF JAPANESE LAW. BUT AS I SAID THEY WOULD OF COURSE BE ACCORDED 
ALL CONSULAR ASSISTANCE THAT ANY AUSTRALIAN IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD 
RECEIVE. THEY WON’T GET PRIVILEGED ASSISTANCE BECAUSE THEY ARE MEMBERS 
OF GREENPEACE AND ARE ENTHUSIASTIC SPEAKERS IN THE MEDIA. ON THE OTHER 
HAND THEY WON’T GET LESSER CONSULAR ASSISTANCE EITHER. THEY WILL GET 
THE NORMAL ASSISTANCE THAT ANY AUSTRALIAN WOULD GET.
