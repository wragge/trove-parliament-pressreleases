 Fingers Crossed, Let’s Hope it Never Happens:  Campbell’s Climate Change Policy   

 The Environment Minister, Ian Campbell, has revealed his Government’s  approach to climate change - “let’s hope it never happens”.   

 Labor has proposed a comprehensive plan to work with our drowning Pacific  neighbours to combat climate change, including establishing an international  coalition to accept climate change refugees.   

 Ian Campbell responded by crossing his fingers, and hoping for the best: “Saying  that we’re going to evacuate them is very premature.  Let’s hope it never  happens.”   

 Climate change is real, and it’s hurting our Pacific neighbours now.  PNG citizens  on the Carteret Islands have become the world’s first climate change refugees.  Tuvalu is expected to be uninhabitable because of rising seas levels over the  coming decade.   

 Tuvalu has twice called for help from the Howard Government, and it’s twice  been rejected.  Now we know why.  The Government has taken the gamble that  things won’t get too bad for our Pacific neighbours. 

 

 The Howard Government will go into next week’s Asia Pacific Climate Pact  meeting without any credibility on climate change.  It’s said no to the Kyoto  Protocol, it’s said no to greenhouse emissions trading, it’s said no to increasing  the mandatory renewable energy target, it’s said no to helping our drowning  Pacific neighbours.   

 Meetings such as the Asia Pacific Climate Pact are positive, but limited. The  Howard Government has crossed its fingers that the Pact will transfer clean  technology without any targets, timetables, strategies or price signals.    

 This stand is in contrast to Pact members Japan, China, South Korea and India  who have all ratified the Kyoto Protocol. In the developed world only Australia  and the US remain on the outside looking in. 

 

 In truth the Howard Government has just crossed its fingers, and hoped that  climate change will go away.   

 The Howard Government is frozen in time while the world warms around it.  It  has left Australia unprepared for the dramatic challenges that climate change will  bring.
