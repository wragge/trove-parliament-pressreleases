  Another 352 arrivals land on our shores -

  Time for the Government to get real about border 
control an  d security

  

  “The Government is faced with the largest number of people to ever 
reach our shores on a single boat, and there are no facilities available 
to house them,” Duncan Kerr, Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs, 
said today.

  

  “Once again, a foreig n vessel has sailed into Australian 
waters. This latest arrival, a ferry from Indonesia carrying 352 people, 
was only two kilometres from Ashmore Reef when it was spotted.

  

 “As if it is not disturbing enough to know that 
boats continue to enter out territorial waters at will, consider this 
- the boat was detected by pure chance alone. Coastwatch, our dedicated 
coastal surveillance agency, had no idea that there was an illegal vessel 
anywhere in the region.

  

 “HMAS Dubbo, while carrying out the duties of destroying 
another illegal vessel, happened to come across the ferry.

  

 “Time and time again, the Opposition has pointed 
out the inadequacies of our current border control arrangements. And 
yet the Government refuses to acknowledge the obvious need for a review 
of the whole situation. How many times does the Opposition have to call 
on the Government to consider establishing an Australian Coastguard 
before they will finally take some action?

  

 “This latest boatload of people also intensifies 
the flip side of our lack of border security. There have been so many 
illegal arrivals recently that there is literally nowhere to house these 
people.

  

 “The Port Hedland detention centre has already had 
its capacity increased from 700 to 785 detainees. With no room at the 
centre, detainees are hanging from the rafters. The situation is no 
better at Curtin military base.

  

 “The consequence of this chronic overcrowding is 
that the 352 new arrivals are going to be put up in a tent city. The 
possible ramifications of attempting to house 352 people in tents are 
enough to make anyone shudder. The Government is going to place these 
people, most of whom are Muslim, in a situation where there will be 
little privacy, minimal hygiene and marginal shelter.

  

 ‘There are two pregnant women in this group, one 
who is in labour. The gaps in our coastal security are opening up opportunities 
for organised crime to exploit the misery of people desperate for a 
better life. The key to solving the problem is fixing our border security, 
not ignoring the humanitarian circumstances of those taking desperate 
measures to arrive. Australians would expect that pregnant women are 
treated with decency. However, it appears that the resources needed 
to do this are becoming more and more stretched.

  

 “The Government must face up to the inadequacies 
of its approach to border control and illegal immigration. It is not 
good enough that boats sail almost all the way to our shores. It is 
not good enough that we now face a serious security issue with overcrowding 
in our detention centres.

  

 “It is time for the Government to take serious action.”
