  Care needs to be taken when comparing monthly or cumulative data across years, and to full year estimates, since factors such as the introduction of The New Tax System and the accrual framework, and the timing of  payments and policy decisions can have a large impact on fiscal aggregates from one year to the next and on year to date outcomes.

  FISCAL OUTCOMES UNDERLYING CASH BALANCE

  The  main  components  of  the  underlying  cash  balance  are  cash  from  operations  and  movements  in  the  net investment in non-financial assets.

  The underlying cash balance for the year to date 31 March 2002 was a deficit of $8,785 million. While this was a $1,179  million  decrease  on  the  February  2002  position,  it  is  on  track  to  achieve  the  underlying  cash  deficit  of $1,193 million as announced in the 2002-03 Budget. The decline in the underlying cash balance is largely due to lower  taxation  collections  for  companies  and  individuals  in  the  month  of  March,  consistent  with  the  seasonal trend of lower collections in the month immediately preceding the quarterly Business Activity Statements.

  The underlying cash balance as at the end of March 2002 is lower than a pro-rata of the revised Budget estimate (which equals a deficit of $895 million).  The main factors contributing to the difference are:

  â¢ significantly  lower  cash  receipts  as  the  majority  of  taxation  receipts  are  received  in  the  final  months  of  the financial year and the majority of refunds are paid in the first half of the financial year; and

  â¢ higher  grant  payments  due  to  payments  in  relation  to  a  number  of  education  grants  that  are  made  at  the commencement of the academic year;

  Partially offset by

  â¢ lower goods and services payments relating to Australia's bilateral aid programme due to a variety of factors including delays in contract payments, claims processing and receipt of invoices;

  â¢ lower personal benefit payments due to the timing of fortnightly cash payments;

  â¢ lower  personal  benefits  payments  due  to  seasonal  demand  for  the  Pharmaceutical  Benefits  Scheme  and Medicare Benefits;

  â¢ lower  grant  payments  due  to  a  slower  rate  of  submission  of  requests  and  subsequent  assessment  of  health grants including for population health, blood products and transfusion services, medical research and home and community care;

  â¢ lower grant payments in relation to National Highway and Roads of National Importance Programme and the Roads to Recovery Programme;

  â¢ lower grant payments partly due to fewer than anticipated claims for the First Home Owners Scheme in the month of March; and

  â¢ lower  suppliers  payments  reflecting  seasonal  patterns  in  Defence  purchasing  and  lower  purchases  earlier  in the financial year while Defence prepared for newly emerging operations.

  Investing  cash  receipts  are  also  lower  than  a  pro-rata  of  the  revised  Budget  estimate  reflecting  that  the  sale  of some non-financial assets are still to occur later in the financial year.  This is partially offset by the lower level of purchases of property, plant and equipment.

  FISCAL BALANCE

  The fiscal balance for the year to date 31 March 2002 was  a deficit of $7,950 million, a $2,301 million decrease since  February  2002.  However  this  is  consistent  with  an  estimated  fiscal  balance  deficit  of  $3,045  million  as announced in the 2002-03 Budget.  The main components of the fiscal balance are the GFS net operating balance, which  was  a  deficit  of  $8,389  million,  and  negative  net  capital  investment  of  $439  million  for  the  year  to  date 31 March 2002 (refer to the Reconciliation of AAS31 Operating Result to Fiscal Balance for further detail).

  FINANCIAL OUTCOMES

  OPERATING RESULT

  The operating result for the year to date 31 March 2002 was a deficit of $7,320 million, a $2,417 million decrease since February 2002. However this is consistent with an estimated operating loss of $3,661 million as announced in  the  2002-03  Budget.  The  position  largely  reflects  the  seasonal  trend  of  lower  taxation  revenue  in  the  month immediately preceding the quarterly Business Activity Statements.

  REVENUES

  Total revenue for the year to date 31 March 2002 was $117,678 million, comprising $105,546 million in taxation revenue and $12,132 million in non-tax revenue.

  The  main  components  in  taxation  revenue  were  PAYG(W)  ($58,998  million,  including  residual  payments  of $41  million  and  $17  million  from  the  now  discontinued  PAYE  and  Prescribed  Payments  Systems  respectively), companies ($19,383 million) and excise duty ($14,678 million), and individuals refunds which reduced net revenue by ($9,591 million).

  The introduction of The New Tax System affects both the timing and quantity of taxation revenue received by the Commonwealth compared to previous years.

  EXPENSES

  Total expenses for the year to date 31 March 2002 were $124,997 million, which is 3 per cent below a pro-rata of the revised Budget estimate of $129,045 million.  Expenses for the year to date are not always directly comparable to full year estimates due to seasonal effects on Commonwealth administered expenses.

  Factors affecting expenses are outlined below (including their impact by function):

  â¢ lower employee expenses relating to a difference between budget and actual nominal interest calculations and the  timing  of  actuarial  revaluation  recognition  in  relation  to  the  civilian  superannuation  schemes.  (These employee expenses are in the General Public Services and Nominal Superannuation Interest functions).

  â¢ lower suppliers expenses reflecting seasonal patterns in Defence purchasing and lower purchases earlier in the financial year while Defence prepared for newly emerging operations. The rate of expenditure is expected to increase  markedly  in  the  remainder  of  the  year.   (These  expenses  are  primarily  included  in  the  Defence function).

  â¢ lower  depreciation  expenses  for  Defence  which  are  expected  to  increase  once  stocktakes  and  asset revaluations occur towards the end of the year.  (These expenses are included in the Defence function).

  â¢ lower expenses relating to the corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric Authority as this is not expected to occur until later in the financial year.  (These expenses are in the Fuel and Energy function).

  â¢ lower grant expenses:

  â’ in  relation  to  National  Highway  and  Roads  of  National  Importance  Programme  and  the  Roads  to Recovery  Programme  largely  due  to  grants  being  recorded  as  prepayments  until  further  milestones  are attained  or  projects  are  completed.  (These  grant  expenses  are  in  the  Transport  and  Communication function).

  â’ due to the slower rate of submission of requests and subsequent assessment of health grants including for population health, blood products and transfusion services, medical research and home and community care.  (These grant expenses are in the Health and Social Security and Welfare functions).

  â’ as negotiations relating to Australia’s contribution to the International Development Association (IDA) and other international health and refugee organisations are yet to be concluded.  (These grant expenses are in the General Public Services function).

  â’ partly due to fewer  claims  for  the First  Home Owners  Scheme grants  in the month of  March.  (These grant expenses are in the General Purpose Inter-Government Transactions function).

  â¢ lower  personal  benefits  expenses  due  to  seasonal  demand  for  the  Pharmaceutical  Benefits  Scheme  and Medicare Benefits. (These personal benefits are in the Health function).

  31 May 2002 Contact: Office of the Minister for Finance and Administration (02) 6277 7400

  4

  Offset by:

  â¢ higher suppliers expenses relating to the Special Employee Entitlements Scheme for Ansett employees.  Most of the claims expected under this scheme have already been made.  (These suppliers expenses are in the Other Economic Affairs function).

  â¢ higher  grant  expenses  for  schools  (Government  and  Non-Government),  higher  education  and  vocational education  training  as  the  funding  is  recognised  on  a  calendar  year  basis.   (The  grant  expenses  are  in  the General Public Services and the Education functions).

  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

  The net asset balance within the General Government sector has weakened from a negative net asset position of $46,305 million at 30 June 2001 to a negative net asset position of $47,779 million at 31 March 2002. This was primarily the result of a reduction in investments.

  NOTES:

  With  the  introduction  of  Business  Activity  Statements  and  Instalment  Activity  Statements  last  financial  year, taxpayers provide information on payments associated with several types of tax when lodging the statement and paying the aggregate net tax amount. Thus, while total tax collections are known with certainty at the end of each month, the distribution across the relevant heads of revenue cannot be finalised until all statements are received and  processed.   The  outcomes  for  some  revenue  items  provided  in  this  statement  are  thus  estimates,  in accordance  with  the  best  judgement  of  the  Taxation  Commissioner,  and  subject  to  revision.  The  taxation revenue  items  not  affected  are:  Other  withholding  tax,  Petroleum  Resource  Rent  Tax,  Excise  duty,  Customs duty, Other Taxes and Individuals Refunds.

  The sum of the revenue accrued in the month and the revisions to prior periods equals the revenue reported in the Statement of Revenue and Expenses.

  All taxation items in these notes are reported on an AAS31 basis.

  In regard to GST revenue, AAS31 and other relevant accounting standards would suggest the gross amount of GST be included in the Commonwealth’s Financial Statements. However, the clear policy intent of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations is that the GST is a State tax collected by the Commonwealth in an agency capacity. Therefore, accrued GST revenues and associated payments to the States and Territories are not disclosed in these statements.
