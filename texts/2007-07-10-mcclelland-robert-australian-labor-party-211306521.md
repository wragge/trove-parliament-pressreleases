 ROBERT MCCLELLAND MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS   

 Address to United Nations Youth Association 

 Canberra 

 10 July 2007 

 

 STRENGTHENING UN RELEVANCE & LEGITIMACY  

 IN THE NEW MILLENNIUM 

 

 According to conspiracy theorists you are all plotters.   

 

 In supporting the United Nations you are each seeking to create a world 

 government that will usurp our country’s legislature and indeed our way of life.   

 

 For instance, in her infamous maiden speech, Pauline Hanson described 

 international treaties not as beneficial agreements freely entered into by 

 independent and sovereign nations but as an attempt by outside forces to control 

 our country. 

 

 The reality is, as former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has stated: 

 

 "Sovereign states are the basic and indispensable building blocks of the 

 international system".1   

 

 So clearly some informed debate is necessary.  And that's where you come in. 

 

 While not as far out in the twilight zone as Pauline Hanson and co. a number of 

 conservative politicians find it difficult to hide their disdain for the UN and 

  1

 multilateralism.  For instance, our Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said only a 

 few years ago in this very building: 

 

 "Multilateralism is a synonym for an ineffective and unfocused policy 

 involving internationalism of the lowest common denominator."2

 

 So, again there is a need for fair appraisal of the role of the United Nations. And 

 again that's where you come in. 

 

 Before you here at the National Press Club today as a fair minded, interested 

 and interesting audience, I intend to discuss the strengths of the United Nations, 

 identify some of its weaknesses and to at least flag some constructive 

 developments.   

 

 I will conclude by discussing the role that you can all play in terms of being a 

 bridge between the activities of the United Nations and the Australian community. 

 

 Firstly, let's all take a reality check.   

 

 For those who genuinely believe that the world would be a better place without 

 the United Nations, can I just remind them of the time before the world body was 

 created and point out three things:   

 

 â¢ two world Wars; 

 â¢ a great Depression; and  

 â¢ a devastating pandemic that killed more people than the World War I and 

 World War II put together. 

 

 While there were obviously a number of causes to these devastating events, the 

 lack of sophistication of international infrastructure was certainly a factor in the 

 extent of havoc, destruction and loss those events caused. 

  2

 

 The purpose and role of the United Nations is just as relevant today as it was 

 when it was founded in 1945.   

 

 Rising from the ashes of the destruction and human devastation of the Second 

 World War, the primary objective of the United Nations was to avoid international 

 conflict and to resolve political contests by peaceful means.   

 

 Specifically, its purpose was to bring an end to armed conflict and preserve 

 international peace.  Even at the time of its creation the interconnection between 

 human rights and sustainable development were seen as integral to international 

 security. 

 

 Today, the major challenges that confront each and every citizen on our planet 

 cannot be solved by one country acting alone. This is the case whether we are 

 talking about the threat of international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of 

 mass destruction, finding a global solution to climate change or advancing the 

 Millennium Development Goals to reduce poverty.  

 

 Even if one country wanted to pay all the bills and take all the risks, the reality is 

 that no single government is capable of solving these challenges alone.   

 

 We can also genuinely ask whether the course of the events in Iraq would have 

 been different if the intervention had been endorsed by the International 

 community. Arguably the intervention would have had greater legitimacy and the 

 international community would have had ownership of finding a solution to 

 sectarian tensions before they developed into the bloody civil war. 

 

 As a wise international commentator told the US Congress earlier this year: 

 

  3

 "there must be a global partnership -- public and private, North and South.  

 New global partnerships can help to clear the path to a more peaceful, 

 prosperous and just world in the 21st century."3    

 

 While it has become something of a blood sport for some conservative politicians 

 to criticise the United Nations, the reality is that most of the critics would have to 

 acknowledge that in its 62 years the United Nations has had considerable 

 success.    

 

 In October 2005 five governments presented a Human Security Report.4  The 

 report concluded that the United Nations deserved much of the credit for 

 achieving a dramatic decrease in the number of conflicts and mass killings 

 occurring around the globe.  It noted a significant reduction in the number of 

 battle deaths and a significant number of conflicts now being peacefully resolved.   

 

 Specifically, since the late 1980s there has been an 80 percent decrease in the 

 number of genocides and politicides.  The average numbers killed in armed 

 conflict have decreased 98 percent from 38,000 at the start of the 1950s to an 

 average of 600 in 2002. 

 

 By early this century the number of civilian deaths was down to approximately 

 600 per conflict.  The report also noted that more civil wars have been ended by 

 negotiation in the past 15 years than in the previous two centuries.  

 

 Reinforcing the evidence that the UN deserves much of the credit for these 

 welcome developments is the marked increase in UN activities over the last two 

 decades.  There has been a sixfold increase in the number of preventative 

 diplomacy missions.  We’ve seen an elevenfold increase in the number of UN 

 economic sanctions against regimes and a fourfold increase in UN peacekeeping 

 operations.  Keep in mind these peacekeeping missions continue to grow larger 

 and more complex since those in the Cold War period. 

  4

 

 As Gareth Evans, our former Minister for Foreign Affairs, said in discussing the 

 Human Security Report - even if a great many people don't want to acknowledge 

 it, the best explanation available "is the huge increase in the level of international 

 preventative diplomacy, diplomatic peacemaking, peacekeeping and peace 

 building operations, for the most part authorised by and mounted by the UN, that 

 has occurred since the end of the Cold War."5

 

 But as fair and objective observers you will know the United Nations does not just 

 deal with countries in crisis.  Our current Foreign Minister, Mr Downer, won't be 

 terribly interested in my opinion but he may be interested in the view of 

 Nicholas Burns, the United States Under-Secretary for Political Affairs. Mr Burns, 

 who I met recently in Washington, and is far from a romantic liberal multilateralist 

 has noted: 

 

  "The UN also plays a vital role in addressing great trans-national issues 

 that are at the forefront of today's challenges, such as HIV/AIDS, tsunami 

 relief, literacy, democracy promotion, human rights, trafficking in persons, 

 freedom of the media, civil aviation, trade and economic development, and 

 the protection of refugees to name but a few."6   

 

 Another significant achievement of the United Nations - which I’m sure would be 

 important to all of you - includes environmental protection.  

 

 Evidence suggests the effects of climate change would be even worse today 

 without the combined efforts of the international community in developing the 

 MontrÃ©al protocol which is starting to turn around the effects of ozone depleting 

 CFC chemicals. 

 

  5

 Equally while much more work still needs to be done, the effort of the 

 international community in developing the Kyoto Protocol to reduce carbon 

 emissions into the atmosphere has been a significant achievement.   

 

 While it is regrettable that Australia is one of only two developed nations not to 

 have ratified Kyoto, the good will and constructive effort of the broader 

 international community must be acknowledged. 

 

 The unsung role of the United Nations also includes the promotion of women's 

 rights, providing safe drinking water, eradicating smallpox, pressing for universal 

 immunisation, reducing child mortality rates, fighting parasitic diseases, 

 promoting investment in developing countries, clearing landmines, preventing 

 overfishing, promoting sustainable forestry development, preventing and cleaning 

 up pollution, promoting the rights of consumers, fighting drug abuse, promoting 

 workers rights around the world, promoting improved agricultural techniques, 

 promoting stability and order on the high seas, improving air travel and sea 

 travel, protecting intellectual property, improving global communications, 

 improving education in developing countries, improving literacy for women, 

 safeguarding and preserving historic cultural and agricultural sites and facilitating 

 academic and cultural exchanges.7    

 

 A review of the extensive list of achievements of the United Nations and a 

 recognition of its ongoing relevance supports the view that if we did not have the 

 UN we would have to create it. 

 

 Having recognized the tremendous achievements of the international community 

 through the United Nations it would be insincere not to also recognise the case 

 for continuing reform. 

 

 In an address to the UN General Assembly in September 2003, then Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced the establishment of a high-level panel on 

  6

 Threats, Challenges and Change to consider issues for reform of the UN to make 

 it more effective for the 21st century.  Significantly for Australia, Gareth Evans 

 was selected as one of the 15 members of the panel. 

 

 The panel's report which was released on the 2 December 2004 formed the basis 

 of debate at the 61st Session of the United Nations General Assembly held in 

 September 2005. 

 

 Both sides of Australian politics supported the reforms agreed to by the 

 United Nations. The reforms included; a strong international recommitment to 

 achieving the millennium goals, replacing the discredited Commission on Human 

 Rights with a new Human Rights Council, establishing a Peace Building 

 Commission, endorsing the doctrine of "Responsibility to Protect", establishing a 

 Democracy Fund and implementing a number of technical and administrative 

 reforms. 

 

 Disappointingly little progress was made in respect to reforming the Security 

 Council, the area of non proliferation or in developing a Convention against 

 Terrorism. 

 

 It is all too often the case that an examination of those areas where the United 

 Nations has been ineffective or has achieved a mediocre outcome is due to 

 ‘spoilers’.  That is, those nations which oppose initiatives as a result of their 

 perceived self-interest.   And an examination of those spoilers, in turn, reveals 

 that they are frequently representatives of totalitarian states. 

 

 This is one of the paradoxes of the United Nations.  Both its strength and 

 weakness lies in its universality of membership.  That is, there is no eligibility rule 

 or any selection process.  Whist there are some suspension and expulsion 

 procedures under Articles 5 and 6 of the UN Charter, the voting requirements of 

  7

 two-thirds of the General Assembly and only after recommendation from the 

 Security Council makes suspensions and expulsions extremely difficult.   

 

 All member states have an equal say on the activities of the United Nations.  In 

 respect to universality of membership it has been said: 

 

  "The presence of so many authoritarian regimes in the community of 

 nations should not be taken complacently; it is a serious problem, both for 

 the capacity and even legitimacy of the United Nations, and even more so 

 for the people who live under their repressive rule."8

 

 The rights of people who live in authoritarian regimes should not be overlooked. 

 In short, who do these representatives of the authoritarian regimes represent 

 when they attend deliberations of the United Nations or its constituent parts?  

 

 I would suggest that such representatives represent only the controlling elites of 

 those authoritarian regimes and not the ordinary citizens that reside within the 

 boundaries of the State. 

 

 This is important because the Charter of the United Nations begins with the 

 words “we the peoples" indicating, I would suggest, the international community's 

 primary obligations are not merely to nation states but also to their citizens.  

 

 Not only are we are entitled to ask, we have an obligation to ask, in whose 

 interests are representatives of authoritarian regimes acting?   

 

 It would be naive in the extreme not to recognise that invariably their primary 

 motivation will be to protect the interests of the ruling elite of their country.  It may 

 well be that, in some instances, the interests of the ruling elite will coincide with 

 the interests of its citizens.  But this will not necessarily be the case and, often, 

 those interests will be diametrically opposed. 

  8

 

 The question for the international community therefore becomes: to what extent 

 should representatives of the ruling elites of the authoritarian regimes be 

 permitted to run interference on the pursuit of the broader ideals of the United 

 Nations?   

 

 Obviously, in framing this question in those terms I would suggest a response is 

 necessary. What then is the appropriate response?   

 

 It is often said that politics is the art of the possible.  In that context it is unrealistic 

 to expect that sufficient numbers could be mustered in the General Assembly to 

 support a reduction or restraint on the influence and activities of authoritarian 

 regimes. 

 

 On the other hand, it should not go without recognition that as a result of the 

 global spread of democracy in recent decades, democracies now constitute a 

 majority of United Nations membership.9  In this context it has been asked why 

 have democracies been such an ineffectual voting bloc?  Specifically it’s asked: 

 

  “Why do developing nations allow a few prominent bloc leaders to speak 

 for them all despite their diversity of economic conditions, cultures and 

 interests? Why are some trans-regional blocs in the United Nations far 

 more cohesive than the trans-regional Democratic Bloc? Why do regional 

 blocs all too often shield their most repressive states from frank appraisal 

 by the international community? Why is the Warsaw Pact still intact as a 

 block in the United Nations? Why are near Eastern, South Asian, and East 

 Asian states all part of the same bloc " 10                

 

 Worthy questions I urge you all to consider. 

 

  9

 It has been suggested that complacency, lack of commitment, lack of 

 determination and/or lack of effort on the part of democratic nations is the 

 reason. 

 

 In that context the recent creation of the United Nations Democracy Caucus has 

 been a welcome development.   

 

 The caucus was developed in June 2000 where over 100 governments gathered 

 at the first Community of Democracies meeting in Warsaw. The attending 

 countries pledged to form caucuses at international and regional institutions to 

 support resolutions and other international activities aimed at the promotion of 

 democratic governance.11   

 

 Unlike membership of the United Nations itself, membership of the democracy 

 caucus is only open to countries that are invited to be participants.  The criteria 

 requires: "states which are elected on the basis of competency of multi-party 

 democracy elections and respectful of fundamental human rights."12

 

 The Community of Democracies presents a real opportunity for democracies to 

 develop “a complimentary or catalytic caucus within the United Nations”.  That 

 influence will only occur however through hard work, communication and a belief 

 that outcomes achieved through the United Nations are worth fighting for.   

 

 And once again - that's where you come in. 

 

 One of the most important responsibilities that national governments can perform 

 for the United Nations is educating their people about the body’s roles and 

 functions.  

 

 As the 2001 Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade 

 report stated, this is “not just a question of Australians appreciating the 

  10

 importance of the UN in an abstract sense, but of understanding the work of the 

 UN as an integral part of modern government.” 

 

 In addition to allaying popular fears and misconceptions, an educated population 

 is also better equipped to hold the UN accountable. The Parliamentary 

 Committee states that “the UN needs to be accountable to its constituents in the 

 same way that national governments are and… much more information about the 

 operations of the UN needs to be disseminated.” 

 

 If the Government is serious about commitment to UN reform, it should provide 

 the Australian public with information for them to gauge the UN’s necessity and 

 evaluate the success or failure of its actions. 

 

 Unfortunately, the mechanisms for UN education have been cut back over the 

 last 11 years of the Howard Government. The UN Association of Australia, an 

 organisation that is tasked with the dissemination of information of the United 

 Nations had its funding reduced from $80,000 per year to just $10,000.  

 

 Members of the UN Youth Association who are present would also be aware of 

 the funding cuts to their own organisation.  

 

 The body has gone from receiving $95,000 per annum under a Labor 

 Government to only $500 from the UNAA, forcing it to seek the rest in ad hoc 

 private donations. UNYA performs a number of vital educational roles including 

 running conferences for school students, enabling them to participate in 

 international UN youth events and providing a conduit directly from them to the 

 Australian Mission to the UN in New York.  

 

 It is completely understandable that the 2001 Committee report recommended 

 that both UNYA and the UNAA receive increased funding from the Federal 

 Government. It is a matter of serious embarrassment that this increase has still 

  11

 not taken place six years after the report was released. 

 

 The bottom line is that the Howard Governments at best ambivalent attitude to 

 the United Nations has been extremely short sighted. Our region as much as any 

 other confronts issues such as climate change, assisting potentially failing states, 

 dealing with the threat of terrorism, controlling narcotics and the evils of human 

 trafficking. None of these can be effectively dealt with without assistance and 

 input form the international community.   

 

 Your Association undertakes valuable work in connecting the youth of Australia 

 to the important work of the United Nations. The Howard Government’s cuts to 

 the UNAA should not have occurred - they were due to ideological obsession 

 and cynicism.  

 

 In the coming weeks I will be preparing a submission to our internal policy 

 development unit that those funding cuts should be reversed.  

 

 I am determined to restore the capabilities of UNAA and the UNYA so that they 

 can properly perform the role as Australian based UN educators, constructive 

 evaluators and contributors.
