 Mentally ill Australian locked up in Baxter cells:  Urgent inquiry needed 

 5th Feb 2005 

 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today called for an inquiry into how a  seriously mentally ill Australian permanent resident was locked up in  an isolation cell in an immigration detention centre for over two  months with no medical help.    

 In late November 2004 Cornelia, was presented to police in North  Queensland by local Indigenous people who found her in a psychotic  state with no identification. She has been missing from a Manly  Psychiatric ward since September and had been registered on the  missing persons list.     

 The police on hearing her speak some words of German apparently did  not check missing persons but instead referred her to immigration  officials who had her transferred to Baxter Detention Centre in South  Australia. At Baxter she was locked up in the isolation cells without  access to medical assessment or treatment while her identity was 

 established.    

 Cornelia's family has identified her from media reports concerning her  maltreatment in Baxter. She turns out to be a 39 year old ex Qantas  flight attendant who has been an Australian permanent resident since 

 she was 18 months old.    

 "The public will rightly ask why in Australia we are locking up mentally  ill people in isolation cells, whether they are asylum seekers or as in  this case an Australian," Senator Nettle said.    

 "Cornelia should be moved into psychiatric care immediately along 

 with any other mentally ill detainees in this government's detention  camps.    

 "I will be calling for an inquiry to examine how this staggering case of  mismanagement and abuse was allowed to happen.    

 "How many other seriously mentally ill people are locked up in the  detention centres?     

 "How many missing persons have been wrongfully incarcerated by our  immigration authorities?    

 "The treatment of this poor woman is indicative of a system which  encourages the perception of asylum seekers as lesser human beings  without rights to basic care and consideration."
