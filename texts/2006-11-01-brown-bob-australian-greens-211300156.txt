 Censorship shatters ABC's Glass House 

 Senator Brown, Wednesday, 1 November 2006 

 The ABC's decision to axe popular Australian comedy series "the Glass House" is  censorship, Greens Leader Bob Brown said today. 

 "The Glass House regularly out-rates commercial programs in the same timeslot and  has a dedicated audience of over 700,000 fans. The decision to axe it is purely  political - this is censorship." 

 "This government has consistently made a fool of itself on climate change, on the war  in Iraq and on refugees and for five years Wil Anderson, Corinne Grant and David  Hughes have delighted and entertained us by pointing this out. Now the plug has been  pulled on this high-rating entertainment show - what will be the next show to go at the  ABC?" asked Senator Brown. 

 The decision to cut the program comes the day after Senator Fierravanti-Wells  attacked the ABC in estimates over Corinne Grant's role as the public face of the  ACTU "your rights at work" campaign. 

 "The Howard government has shown that it lacks that most Australian of values - a  self-deprecating sense of humour," Senator Brown said.
