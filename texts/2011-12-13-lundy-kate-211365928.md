 CHRIS BOWEN MP 

 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP   

 SENATOR KATE LUNDY 

 PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY FOR IMMIGRATION  AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS   

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 13 December 2011 

 REVIEWS LEAD TO IMPROVED SETTLEMENT SERVICES   

 Improvements to refugee settlement services are on track following independent scrutiny of  service delivery, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, said today.   

 Mr Bowen and Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Kate  Lundy, today released the Review of Humanitarian Settlement Services (HSS) Performance  Measures and Contract Management. 

 

 Mr Bowen said the Government would accept all the recommendations from the report by  David Richmond AO into the adequacy of the performance measures and framework, as well  as the Immigration Department’s contract management processes.   

 The review by Mr Richmond was commissioned in May after an independent review found  serious issues with service delivery to clients in the Hunter region under the previous  Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS) program.   

 In April this year the Gillard Government replaced the IHSS program with the Humanitarian  Settlement Services (HSS) program and introduced a comprehensive set of changes to  strengthen and improve the settlement framework.   

 “The review by Mr Richmond found that although the HSS is generally well managed,  improvements can be made in certain areas such as contract performance management,  reporting and quality control,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “The Government has accepted the recommendations of the review and I have asked my  department to establish an implementation taskforce to provide regular progress reports.    

 “Work to improve and review settlement services is ongoing and we have already inspected  the standard of more than 400 properties, and as a result, relocated four families to more  appropriate accommodation.”   

 The Review of Humanitarian Settlement Services found that:   â¢ There needed to be more proactive contract management and better reporting;  â¢ Strategies were required to improve performance measures supporting the program;  â¢ Better safeguards were needed on accommodation standards, particularly in stressed urban  housing markets;  â¢ The Quality Assurance framework needed revising, and reporting and dialogue between the  department and service delivery networks needed strengthening; and  â¢ Service providers could improve their relationships with clients ‘on the ground’.   In addition, a forensic audit of Resolve FM’s financial management practices under the IHSS  program commissioned by the Government found that there was no evidence of falsified or  erroneous transactions. 

 

 Senator Lundy said the Government had strengthened humanitarian settlement support  services across Australia and around major regional centres under the HSS Program.    

 “The review supported the improvements to our settlement services introduced by the  Government earlier this year, but highlighted the ongoing management challenges associated  with successful settlement,” Senator Lundy said.   

 “Australia’s settlement services are now more comprehensive and robust than they have been  in the past, but we remain focused on addressing emerging issues to ensure better  settlement outcomes for new arrivals and the Australian community. 

 

 “As a Government we are committed to delivering strong settlement support to help some of  the community’s most vulnerable people start a new life in Australia and become participating  members of the community.    

 “I would like to thank Mr Richmond and others who have provided valuable input into the  review, as well as the professional and committed service providers who deliver settlement  services to newly arrived refugees.”
