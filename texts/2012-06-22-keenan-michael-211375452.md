 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling VESSEL IN DISTRESS June 22, 2012

 Last night the Coalition received news of a capsized vessel in distress in waters north of Christmas Island carrying  approximately 200 people.  This is a very distressing and tragic incident and we offer our heartfelt sympathy for the  asylum seekers involved in this tragedy.

 We are not yet in possession of all the details, but clearly there has been a significant loss of live at sea in a very  treacherous journey from Indonesia to Australia. 

 We are also thinking of our hardworking men and women of Border Protection Command who are helping with this rescue  effort under extreme pressure.

 The Coalition will be seeking a briefing from the Minister for Home Affairs once the operational phase of the rescue is  over.
