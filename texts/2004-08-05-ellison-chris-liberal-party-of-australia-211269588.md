 More bogus Labor claims on Customs 

 

 Claims that all detections of Performance and Image Enhancing Drugs (PIEDs) by Customs related to  elite sports competitors were wrong, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Chris Ellison, said  today.   

 “Senator Mark Bishop has ignored the important fact that nearly one-third (401) of the 1269 detections  of PIEDs in 2002-03 were of image-enhancing substances such as DHEA, which are generally not  linked with sports performance and are often bought over the Internet for their alleged anti-ageing  properties,” Senator Ellison said.   

 “Some 92 per cent of PIED detections in 2002-03 were found in either cargo or postal items, with  Customs not always in a position to know whether a detection - particularly through the mail - relates  to a sporting competitor.   

 “In addition, the detection of a prohibited PIED in the post or in cargo does not necessarily mean that  the addressee imported it.   

 “Attacks on Customs by Senator Bishop are an unjustified slur on a hard-working agency.   

 “As a minimum, all prohibited imports such as PIEDs are seized at the border so they cannot enter the  Australian community.   

  “Any decision by Customs to pursue a prosecution is based on the seriousness of the offence under the  Customs Act, not potential consequences that a competitor might face from sporting bodies.”   

 Senator Ellison outlined a strong record by Customs in referring elite competitors in recent years:   

 â¢ Since 2000, Customs has provided advice from possible importations involving elite  competitors to the Australian Sports Commision (ASC) and the Australian Sports Drug Agency  (ASDA) on 25 occasions, including seven in 2003 alone;   

 â¢ In 2002 and 2003, Customs formally investigated a total of 376 importations of PIEDs;   

 â¢ Of these cases, 76 prosecutions were launched by Customs and 67 convictions resulted.   

 “Customs has a very good record in this area, and works hard to protect Australians from illicit drugs,  illegal arrivals and other threats to our welfare,” Senator Ellison said.   

 “Senator Bishop should take a closer look at the facts before he launches another baseless attack on the  men and women of the Australian Customs Service.”
