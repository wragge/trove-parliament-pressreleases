 Asylum seekers and PNG

 Details Published on Wednesday, 24 July 2013 06:32

 The Coalition will continue to scrutinise all statements and claims of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, particularly with regard to the people smuggling issue where he has  a long track record of failure.

 It is clear that the Papua New Guinea government believes there has been a major shift in the way Australia's $500m foreign aid program will be managed.

 There was no mention of this change in the agreement signed last Friday or at the subsequent press conference. Mr Rudd must reveal:

 the full detail of the proposed new arrangements, including oversight, accountability and governance;

 the full list infrastructure projects that Mr Rudd has promised to fund;

 the amount of additional funding promised to PNG in addition to the current budget;

 any cuts to other countries or programs to fund this increase; and

 whether this arrangement will be extended to other nations that receive Australia's foreign aid.

 Our concerns are with Mr Rudd's behaviour and his failure to be open and honest about what he has promised under this arrangement.
