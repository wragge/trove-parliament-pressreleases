 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON KIM C BEAZLEY MP   

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVIEW , PARLIAMENT HOUSE,   14 AUGUST 2006   

 E & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:      Immigration Legislation; Petrol prices; MacFarlane;  Jetstar/Qantas AWAs; AC Nielsen/Newspoll; Transport Security;   

 BEAZLEY:  I very much welcome Senator Fielding’s statement that he is  going to vote against this appeasement Bill in the Senate when it appears before  the Senate over the next couple of days.  That’s a very welcome development.  I  don’t take anything for granted in this.  The simple fact of the matter is if this Bill  is to be defeated it will require the abstention or the votes against from a number  of Coalition Senators.  And can you imagine the bullying the Coalition Senators  are now being subject to?  And I really hope, in particular that people ease off on  Senator Troeth.  It’s important that this Bill is defeated and it’s important that  pressure is not brought to bear on those Government Senators. 

 

 Now the Prime Minister is about to announce part of Labor’s policy on fuel -  which we welcome of course, as we’ve had a Blueprint out on dealing with petrol  prices and getting ourselves unhitched from Middle East fuel.  So, any step by  the Prime Minister in that direction is welcome.  But there are two things that are  critical and he has not done enough on either of those fronts.  The first is: the  Australian people are entitled in this period of massively rising petrol prices to the  attention on the issue of a decent watchdog.  The Prime Minister must ensure  that the ACCC, both has the powers and the direction, to do proper, hard  monitoring of what the petrol companies are doing.   

 Now, the second thing: we must have a long-term plan to unhitch ourselves from  dependency on Middle East oil.  That requires, of course, a plan for expanding  ethanol and bio-diesel usage.  It requires also a plan to introduce gas to liquid  conversion.  We will not get control of our petrol prices, we will not be able to  advantage ourselves economically until we can unhitch from dependency on  Middle East oil.   

 The third thing I want to talk about is the spread of the Jetstar AWAs to Qantas.  I  don’t want to see an industrial system in this country where mainstream workers  are working for American-style tips.  Now, that’s the sort of thing which is coming  in via the Jetstar AWA and is likely to shift across to Qantas.  This is John  Howard’s legislation now beginning to undermine the economic conditions of  Middle Australia.  The sorts of jobs over the years, which Qantas has provided 

 are the sort of jobs many Australians aspire to.  Good skilled work, interesting  occupation.  But increasingly now, subject to the depredations of the Howard  Government’s AWA system.  Over to you. 

 

 JOURNALIST: We’ve just had a Liberal backbencher come through saying  in comparing the Migration Bill if it’s not passed to almost allowing terrorists to  come into the country.  Is this the type of pressure you’re talking about?   

 BEAZLEY:  Well I haven’t of course heard what that particular individual  had to say but that is rather typical of the bullying that’s been directed towards  Coalition members.  It’s been going on for quite some considerable period of  time, and one of the favourite instruments of the delivery of the bullying message  I’ve got to say is these good doorstops here.  So that sounds to me, though I  haven’t heard that comment obviously as a piece of all of that.   

 JOURNALIST: It was Don Randall.   

 BEAZLEY:  Well what a surprise.  What a surprise that Randall would be  the designated hitter on this thing.  But this has been a pretty unedifying  performance by the Liberal Party on their own, abuse, threats of pre-selection,  actual challenges in relation to pre-selection.  And you’ve had a regular parade of  these characters through the doorstops in the morning making sure that those  warnings are verbalised.     

 JOURNALIST: Is it just anecdotal or do you have actual evidence, for  example, if Senator Troeth had been heavied this weekend?   

 BEAZLEY:  I am not privy to what goes on inside the Liberal Party - I can  only see what you see.  And that is the externalities of it you know, what’s said in  public and what’s hinted at in well sourced media stories - I’d say a lot of  bullying.   

 JOURNALIST: With the LPG conversion, do you think it will help real  battlers, I mean it’s still a fairly upfront cost?   

 BEAZLEY:  What will help real battlers in the immediate is a properly  empowered ACCC.  You’ve got the ACCC running a hard line on the oil  companies, holding them to account, ruthlessly inspecting the way in which  they’re doing their calculations internally before they sell on to the retailers.  These sorts of things, is what’s required if you’re going to help the battlers out.   But I don’t want to run anything down, I mean any bit helps.  I’m glad to see the 

 Prime Minister is actually finally doing something about it.  We’ve been talking  about it for a very long time.   

 JOURNALIST: How much difference would giving the ACCC more teeth  make in terms of price at the pump? 

 

 BEAZLEY:  I think it would be downward pressure.  Obviously there are  other factors involved in price gouging and the rise in the price of oil - I don’t kid  myself about that.  The Australian people think the Government’s not doing  enough about oil prices.  They know that the source of the prices rises starts with  the cost of importing oil, but they nevertheless, sense that the Government is not  doing all it can.  But for the life of me I cannot work out why Costello and Howard  won’t give the ACCC that mandate.  What harm does it do?  The simple fact of  the matter is that the ACCC, with that proper mandate, would at least start to  flatten out some of the excesses in the performance of the oil companies on oil  price rises - and that would be a good thing.     

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, were you embarrassed by your confusion over  Ian MacFarlane and Ian MacFarlane?   

 BEAZLEY:  I expect that Peter Costello will be out there crowing all over  it today, you know, clutching at straws by the straw man - that’s our Peter.  So,  he’ll be out there full of mockery but the truth of the matter is I didn’t lie about  interest rates in the last election, and that’s what they’ve got to live with. 

 

 JOURNALIST: You did get it wrong I mean it was just an innocent mistake,  was it?   

 BEAZLEY:  Of course it was a mistake.  But you know from time to time  you make a mistake.  As I said I expect that Costello will be out there crowing  about it.  What he’s got to answer for is his performance at the last election.   There’s a hell of a difference making a mistake about a bloke, and misleading the  Australian people.   

 JOURNALIST: So someone will be taking a rooster into the House rather  than a chicken?   

 BEAZLEY:  I’ll allow the barnyard analogies to rest with your good self.   

 JOURNALIST: The AC Neilsen poll has Labor in front but your approval  rating has gone back, does that concern you?   

 BEAZLEY:  You know on the doorstep I don’t talk about polls but these  polls will recede and advance.  The one thing I am impressed with is our  continuing contestability despite the circumstances at the moment which would  normally not necessarily be propitious for us.  You know this poll is been taken in  the atmosphere of a substantial security issue.  And that is invariably, an 

 atmosphere which tends to lend support to a Government, lend support to a  Prime Minister.  That’s what happens, which is no bad thing incidentally, when  there’s a national security issue around that the people start to feel a sense of 

 dependence or solidarity with the Government.  So, to remain contestable within  those circumstances I think that’s pretty good.   

 JOURNALIST: Just on that security issue, there’s some concern with  regional airports that don’t have any screening at all. Is that something you would  address?   

 BEAZLEY:  Absolutely.  Look, we need these things.  One: we need a  cop of the beat full-time so Mick Palmer do the job full-time as the Transport  Safety and Security Inspector.  Two: we’ve got to get all the baggage x-rayed in  all the major airports - currently now it’s selectively x-rayed.   

 JOURNALIST: But what about regional airports?   

 BEAZLEY:  The third thing that we need is we need the regional airports  to be security screened.  There’s 145 of them, I think, I can stand corrected,  about a dozen are screened and there’s a question mark over how effectively  that screening is.  But the regional airports were identified by Wheeler as an  obvious source of threat and as far as I can see, very little has been done about  it.  There was a promise by the Transport Minister, the then Transport Minister,  12 months ago that he’d put in the statutes for Mick Palmer as the security  transport investigator and nothing’s emerged.  This is the pattern of this  Government, magnificent spin, out there always with the issues and running  ahead of the issues, but when it comes to implementation, it doesn’t matter what  you’re talking about in implementation - it’s botched and this is botched. 

 

 JOURNALIST: But would a Labor Government pay for that screening at the  regional airports?   

 BEAZLEY:  We would take the view that on all things in relation to  security; be it aviation security; be it security at sea; be it security on the trains  that we would be prepared to accept some share of the responsibility for it.  Yes,  in terms, fiscally.  But we would also expect that those who’d benefit from the  commercial capacities of the aviation system would pay as well.  So, these are  the sorts of considerations.  We would certainly be prepared to be in there to  help.  But the most important thing is we would be there to make absolutely  certain it was done.
