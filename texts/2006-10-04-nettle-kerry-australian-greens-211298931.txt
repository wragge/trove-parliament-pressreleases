 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 

 Last Tampa refugee still has no reply from Department of  Immigration 

 Senator Nettle, Wednesday 4th October, 2006 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle spoke to the last remaining Tampa refugee on Nauru  who told him that he still has not had a reply to his desperate letter sent to the  department one month ago. 

 "I spoke to Mohammed this morning to see if he had received a reply to his letter yet  and he told me that he had not," Senator Nettle said. 

 "The department must do better than to treat Mohammed in this way. He is a refugee  who deserves compassionate treatment not cold bureaucratic indifference. 

 "I call again for John Howard to end this debacle and bring Mohammed Sagar to  Australia.
