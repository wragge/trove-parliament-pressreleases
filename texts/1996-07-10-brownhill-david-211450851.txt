  CHILE- THE FIRST "LATIN TIGER" 

  There are significant and growing opportunities for Australian companies in South American  countries such as Chile but a long-term approach will be necessary to ensure the fulfilment of  that potential. 

  This was one of the main messages in a speech by Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Trade Senator David BrO\\nhill at a seminar titled "Investment Opportunities in Chile" in  Melbourne this morning. 

  Senator Brownhill said that while Australia 's trade policy is focused on the East Asian region  there was also a determination not to neglect other regions, particularly South America. 

  "Indeed, many comparisons have been drawn between the dynamic Chilean economy and the  so-called 'tiger ' economies of East Asia, 'vvith the result that Chile has been labelled 'the first  Latin tiger '," he said. 

  "The government considers the emerging markets in Latin America to be of considerable  significance, as indicated by the recent visit by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for  Trade Tim Fischer. 

  Senator Brownhill said Australia already has a large presence in Chile with $1.3 billion  invested , making it the sixth largest foreign investor. 

  "More than 30 Australian companies now maintain offices in Santiago and this is set to  increase." . 

  "Bilateral trade has also been improving at an encouraging pace and total trade has increased  from $91 million in 1991 to $246 million in 1995 -an increase of 170% over 5 years. 

  "A major component of this increase has been the expansion of Australia's coal exports to  Chile which totalled $68 million in 1995." 

  Senator Brownhill said an added incentive was the fact that Australians and Chileans enjoyed a  good understanding in terms of business culture, partly due to the existence of goodwill  between the two countries after Chilean refugees were accepted in the 1970s and 1980s.
