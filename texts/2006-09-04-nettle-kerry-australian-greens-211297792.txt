 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales 

 

 

 Minister confirms her intention to send persecuted  Burmese to Nauru 

 Senator Nettle, Monday 4th September 2006 

 Immigration Minister Senator Amanda Vanstone confirmed in answer to Senator  Kerry Nettle in question time today that she intends to send the eight Burmese asylum  seekers from the persecuted Rohingya Burmese minority to Nauru out of reach of  Australia's refugee protection law. 

 "The Minister knows that this ethnic minority face terrible persecution in Burma,  including being denied citizenship, forced into slave labour, beaten and imprisoned,  yet remains willing to make a political point at their expense," Senator Nettle said. 

 "The Minister can and should exercise her ministerial power in the public interest to  bring these men to the Australian mainland to have their asylum claims fairly  assessed.  

 "Given;  

 â¢ Burma's appalling human rights record,   â¢ the strong likelihood that these Burmese asylum seekers will be found to be  genuine refugees,   â¢ the fact they have Australian based lawyers who can't be guaranteed access to 

 them in Nauru   â¢ the history of psychological damage experienced by detainees on Nauru and   â¢ it is highly unlikely third country resettlement could be found,  

 it can not be in the public interest for the Minister to do otherwise. 

 "The Rohingya asylum seekers fled first to Malaysia but have come to Australia  because they could not get protection in that country. 

 "The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants Country Report for Malaysia in  2006 has noted that last year 20 Rohingya refugees were deported back to Burma  from Malaysia, confirming the threat these men were under. 

 "To insist on the application of the "pacific solution" policy of sending these asylum  seekers to Nauru is cruel political game playing."
