 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA                          MONDAY 21 NOVEMBER 2005 

 SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT  AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS DEPUTY LEADER 

 FAMILY SEEKING ASYLUM SENT TO CHRISTMAS ISLAND - WHY?   

 The Australian Democrats are extremely concerned about news that a family (including children) of  asylum seekers from West Timor have been flown from Darwin to the Christmas Island immigration  detention centre.  

  Senator Bartlett, spokesperson for immigration, was especially alarmed to learn that children were  still being detained despite the Government's promise that children would only be detained as a last  resort.  

  "We want to know exactly what the cost has been to unnecessarily fly these people over to  Christmas Island and why, seeing that they managed to arrive within the accepted migration zone  and should be processed here," Senator Bartlett said.   

  "The only possible reason this family has been transferred to such a remote location is the very  deliberate intention of the Government to deny these people proper processing of their claims and to  prevent them from accessing adequate legal and other support.  It is also assists the Government to  keep the family away from media attention or public scrutiny."    

  "This is another clear example that the much-lauded 'culture change' within DIMIA is still very patchy  at best."  

 “The fact that we have a situation where numerous fishing boats are getting away with illegal  fishing annually only highlights the fact that the Government's 'border protection' rhetoric is nothing  but an expensive farce and is akin to Minister Vanstone's comments on anti-terror  security measures being a tool to make people feel better rather than something which achieve  anything substantial,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
