 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Greens back UNHCR on call to end Christmas Island uncertainty   

 The Australian Greens have today backed the UNHCR which is concerned about the  uncertain fate of nearly 300 asylum seekers in limbo on Christmas Island since the Gillard  government’s May 7 announcement with the Malaysian government.   

 “After visiting the 270 people held in indefinite detention on Monday and Tuesday it is clear  to me the government should just start assessing their claims with a view to resettling those  found to be in genuine need of protection,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Sen.  Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Forty seven of them are children living in tents and cramped dongas with no access to  schooling.   

 “The Gillard government should listen to what the UNHCR is saying, and inform the asylum  seekers of what will be happening to them.   

 “The deal with Malaysia has not been signed, so we can still walk away from it and honour  our international obligations at the same time as saving taxpayers hundreds millions of  dollars. 

 

 “The government’s plans to use Manus Island in Papua New Guinea are also uncertain now  the country’s foreign minister and major proponent of the deal, Don Polye, has been sacked.   

 “The Gillard government should end off-shore processing, scuttle its planned Asia Pacific  solution, and take the cheaper and humane option of assessing claims on the Australian  mainland.”
