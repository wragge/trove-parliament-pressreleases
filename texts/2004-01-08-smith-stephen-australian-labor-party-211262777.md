 NAURU HUNGER STRIKE 

 

 I welcome the announcement that the Nauru hunger strikers will suspend their hunger  strike from 2 pm Australian Eastern Summer Time today.     

 I note that the decision to suspend the hunger strike is based upon the announcement  of a voluntary medical team’s planned visit to Nauru with the support of the Nauru  Government, together with the decision of the Australian Government to review cases  at the request of the UNHCR based on changed circumstances in certain parts of  Afghanistan.   

 This decision has clearly been helped by the concern expressed by the Nauru  Government, together with the goodwill of the medical professionals involved.    

 Regrettably, the Howard Government has played no role in bringing the matter to this  point.     

 From day one, the Government’s handling of this matter has been appalling.   

 Immigration Minister Vanstone has simply denied responsibility and sought to blame  others for the predicament.  As late as yesterday former Immigration Minister  Ruddock said that it was not a responsibility of the Howard Government.   

 There could have been decisive action by the Government as early as Christmas Eve,  when the first suggestion of difficulties with medical services was made and when the  UNHCR called on the Howard Government to review cases in line with the  UNHCR’s own determination.   

 Regrettably, it was only as late as this week that Minister Vanstone made it clear that  the Government would reluctantly review the cases, while the question of the  adequacy of medical services descended into an unseemly sledging of the Nauru  Government.   

 This sorry circumstance underlines the benefit of Labor’s policy position: that the  Pacific Solution should end, that detainees should be detained by Commonwealth  officers on Commonwealth territory and that there should be sensible accountability  measures like media and independent medical access to detainees.   

 Ends
