 INCREASING ASSISTANCE TO REFUGEES   

 Australia has a proud record of resettling people in humanitarian need and is one of only ten countries with a  formal  established  resettling  program.   A  new  booklet,  Australia’s  Support  for  Humanitarian  Entrants,  has   been designed to assist this settlement process.   

 “Australia  currently  has  the  second  largest  dedicated  humanitarian  resettlement  program  in  the  world,  and  our settlement programs are looked on as an international benchmark,” Member for Wannon, David Hawker,  said.   

 “This  publication  demonstrates  the  Australian  Government’s  strong  commitment  to  Refugees  and   humanitarian entrants by ensuring they have access to the information and services they may need to settle  successfully  in  our  regions.   It  should  prove  invaluable  to  the  Sudanese  resettling  pilot  program  currently   underway in Warrnambool.   

 “The booklet details the services provided to refugees, statistics about client groups receiving these services  and the circumstances that have caused many of these people to leave their home countries.   

 “These services affirm the capacity and dignity of refugee and humanitarian entrants and provide them with  the skills and tools to reach self sufficiency and make their own way along the settlement path as soon as  possible,” he said. 

 

 The provision of these intensive settlement services are an investment that returns enormous benefits for the  refugees as well as for the social, cultural and economic life of Australia.   

 “With an estimated 20 million people who are refugees or of interest to the United Nations Commissioner for  Refugees, it is essential that we are able to offer resettlement to those in most urgent need who have little  prospect of returning to their home countries,” Mr Hawker said.   

  “The  publication  is  an  invaluable  resource  for  service  providers,  volunteers  and  all  people  committed  to   assisting refugees settle in our region.”   

 The publication can be downloaded from the DIMIA website:  www.immi.gov.au/search_for/publications/humanitarian_support_2004/index.htm.
