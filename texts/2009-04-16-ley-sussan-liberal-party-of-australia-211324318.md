 The Hon SUSSAN LEY MP  Federal Member for Farrer  Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs

 MEDIA RELEASE  For immediate release   

 Explosion proves risk and tragedy in people smuggling 

 Today’s explosion on a boat carrying asylum seekers off the coast of Western Australia is a  terrible tragedy but underlines how the insidious practice of people smuggling puts peoples’ lives  at risk, Shadow Minister for Customs and Justice Sussan Ley said. 

 Ms Ley has been in Darwin this week to meet with Australian Customs and Border Protection  Services. The announcement today that three people were killed on the boat that was intercepted  at Ashmore reef yesterday coincided with Ms Ley’s visit. 

  More than 40 other Middle Eastern asylum seekers were injured in the explosion in the engine  room which occurred while the boat was drifting at Ashmore Island before being escorted to  Christmas Island. 

  “I convey my condolences to the families of those that have been killed or injured,” Ms Ley said. 

 “I also pay tribute to the bravery of the men and women who undertake this dangerous work on  our behalf protecting our borders every day.” 

 Ms Ley said this incident demonstrated the inherent dangers in the reprehensible practice of  people-smuggling into Australia. 

 “The dangers exist not only for those on board often unseaworthy or derelict vessels but also for  our service personnel, called upon to intercept or rescue these boats,” she said. 

 “We have repeatedly warned that continued people smuggling into Australia puts people’s lives  at risk and that every effort must be made to ensure it does not continue.” 

 She said the Coalition was able to reduce this trade into Australia to virtually zero and strong  policies were the right way to protect our borders and prevent lives being put at risk. 

 Ms Ley is calling on Mr Rudd and Mr Debus to ensure that an adequate level of funding is  allocated in the upcoming May budget to customs and border protection. 

 “We certainly do not want to see further cuts or forced efficiency dividends similar to last year’s  budget which, I believe, have not enabled customs appropriate resources to adequately patrol  our borders,” she said.
