  The maximum savings of $250m imply that the proposed  measures have been fully effective for two years of migrant  arrivals (since the measures refer to migrants in their  first two years after arrival). With the new policy  applying from soon after the election but only $50m savings  anticipated in year 1, it appears that it will take three  financial years for two full year migrant intakes to be  affected fully by the proposed measures. 

  ASSUMPTIONS USED: 

  Senator Richardson's response to Senator Alston's Question  on Notice of 16 August 1991 (No. 1157) estimated the total  value of social security payments made in 1990-91 to  overseas born clients who have been in Australia two years 

  or less at $399m. 

  Savings identified could be achieved through a combination  of measures: 

  a substantial reduction in the migration intake (as  announced on p 62 of the Overview paper); 

  a rebalancing of the program in favour of s~illed  migrants (again on p 62 of the Overview paper); 

  the maintenance and implied extension of the assurance  of support and bond schemes (p 290 of the Taxation and  Expenditure Reform paper); and 

  a tightening of eligibility criteria for Special  Benefit (as on p 277 of the Taxation and Expenditure  Reform paper). 

  While the above measures potentially could achieve the  savings or more, some factors which would tend to offset the  possible savings are: ~ 

  the higher benefits paid to those who will prove to be  eligible for Special Benefit or remain eligible for  other benefits (refugees and humanitarian entry status  immigrants); 

  any exemption from the new restriction for migrants  from countries, including New Zealand, covered by  reciprocal social security agreements; 

  the relatively large proportion of unemployment and  Special Benefit recipients accounted for by refugees  (who remain eligible for benefits under the proposal);  and 

  any increase in the proportion and number of migrants  eligible for Special Benefit resulting from economic  circumstances. 

  In addition, the Government's bond scheme, by itself, is  estimated to reduce the net cost of social security benefits  by $34m in 1993-94. 

  POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF PROPOSAL: 

  The achievement 6f the proposed savings is likely to be  linked to at least three policy changes: 

  a significant reduction in the migration intake; 

  a substantial shift in the composition of the migrant  intake towards skilled or other categories of migrants  expected not to be a call on social security payments;  and 

  an extension of the assurance of support and bond  schemes.
