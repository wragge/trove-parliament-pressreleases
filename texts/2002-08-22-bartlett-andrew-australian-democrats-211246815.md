 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 22 August 2002  MEDIA RELEASE                          02/414

 

 ALP supports Democrats’ amendment to Child Protection Convention  

 In a welcome show of support for human rights and international conventions, the Labor Party has voted in support of a Democrats’ amendment during debate on the Bill ratifying the Child Protection Convention.  

 Democrats’ Spokesperson for Immigration Senator Andrew Bartlett said, “The amendments reinforce support for Articles of the Convention which state that refugee children and children who are internationally displaced are under the jurisdiction of the state which must take measures to protect those children.  

 “What we have done is ensure that the Senate recognises the policy of mandatory detention for asylum seekers especially children does not work in the best interests of children.  

 “The Democrats are very pleased that the ALP has given its support to a motion condemning mandatory detention of child asylum seekers.  I hope this is a sign of a significant practical shift for the ALP away from supporting the law which allows such long-term detention of children,” Senator Bartlett said.  

  Amendment to the Family Law Amendment (Child Protection Convention) Bill 2002  

 (a) recognises that the Child Protection Convention: (i) stresses the need to improve the protection of children in international situations; (ii) recalls the importance of international cooperation for the protection of

 children;

 (iii) confirms that the best interests of the child are to be a primary consideration; and (iv) reinforces the obligation of Australia to protect refugee and internationally displaced children; (b) and therefore: (i) condemns the practice of mandatory detention of child asylum seekers which

 fails to meet our protection obligations; and (ii) calls upon the Government to detain children only as a measure of last resort, and then only for the shortest appropriate period of time, necessary to conduct

 background health and identity checks.
