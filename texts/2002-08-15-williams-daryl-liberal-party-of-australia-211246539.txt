 Launch of the National Pro Bono Resource Centre

 & Opening of the Pro Bono Workshop

 State Library, Sydney, NSW

 10.00am.

 Subject:  Pro Bono, Bakhtiyaris…………………………………………………………e&oe

 ATTORNEY:

 Thanks for coming out. This is an auspicious day for the legal profession and for the disadvantaged in the community who rely upon lawyers who provide pro bono legal services. We are very pleased to be launching today the Pro Bono Resource Centre which will be run by a partnership led by the Public Interest Advocacy Centre. The establishment of the Resource Centre was a recommendation of the Pro Bono Taskforce which I established following the very successful first National Pro Bono Law Conference in August 2000. The chairman of the taskforce, Professor David Weisbrot, who is also the president of the Australian Law Reform Commission, had a very expert group who put together a set of recommendations which have been adopted by the Government. As a consequence we had this important Centre set up. It’s object will be to promote pro bono, provide information and to provide a means whereby the legal profession institutions involved in pro bono and recipients can work together. The Government has provided $1 million over four years for the promotion of pro bono through the Resource Centre and we’re very pleased that the Resource Centre has been able to identify an expert director in Mr Gordon Renouf who has extensive experience in access to justice and consumer law and law reform and extensive experience with community organisations. This is a very happy day and I’m very pleased that the PIAC and the Public Interest Law Clearing House are running a workshop on pro bono today which is roughly the second anniversary of the holding of the first national conference.

 REPORTER:

 Attorney-General, at a seminar recently on unrepresented litigants, Justice Faulks of the Family Court said that it was a misconception of Government that lawyers should give their time for nothing and this was no basis for Government policy. How would you respond to that?

 ATTORNEY:

 Well, I’ve been at pains before, during and since the National Conference on Pro Bono, to emphasise that it is not Government policy to substitute pro bono for legal assistance through legal aid commissions and community legal organisations. We provide over $120 million to Australian legal aid commissions and we provide over $20 million to some 126 community

 legal organisations. We will continue that funding. We have no intention of reducing it. We do see great advantage in pro bono for people who might fall between the cracks, who don’t qualify for assistance from the legal aid commission and are not able to access community law organisations. Lawyers can provide legal assistance in a variety of ways through pro bono which are not readily available through legal aid commissions or community legal organisations.

 REPORTER:

 Attorney-General, the Bakhtiyari boys, the report tabled in Parliament yesterday,  I mean are they going to be set free into the community?

 ATTORNEY:

 Well let me say a couple of things about that. We’re a little surprised that that report was released. The report was actually requested by the Commonwealth Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. The request was made to the Family and Youth Services Department of the South Australian Government and those reports are normally protected and treated as confidential. So we are a bit surprised that it was released. The other comment I’d make about the report is that, on the instructions of their lawyers, apparently the Bakhtiyari boys did not cooperate with the inquiry and accordingly it may well be that the assessment by the South Australian department was compromised. As far as the future of the boys was concerned, the Government’s interest is to ensure that their best interests are protected. They do represent a flight risk, given their history. They have not been assessed to be refugees and so are subject to the detention policy. The new centre at Baxter is likely to open in a month. It’s possible that they may be moved there but at this stage there’s been no decision made in respect of that. As far as going into the community is concerned, that’s unlikely in the present circumstances, given the risk that the boys seem to represent.

 REPORTER:

 If they are displaying signs of anti-social behaviour according to this report, putting them into another facility such as Baxter surely isn’t going to help them?

 ATTORNEY:

 Well Baxter is a more modern facility and if that is where they are going to be put, and I don’t say it is because no decision has been made, then that would improve their situation.

 REPORTER:

 Doesn’t the report give more weight to the argument that children shouldn’t be kept in detention centres?

 ATTORNEY:

 Well I don’t think anybody wants to see children kept in detention centres but you have to bear in mind that these people came here uninvited, they’re not found to be refugees, they are found not to be refugees, and on that basis they are subject to the normal policy. Where appropriate circumstances apply, families with children can be put in the community. In the case of these boys, it’s not an option.

 REPORTER:

 What about the idea of transferring them to Villawood to be closer to their father?

 ATTORNEY:

 Well Villawood is not actually a suitable facility for this particular case and my advice from the Minister’s office is that it’s not likely that they will be transferred to Villawood.

 REPORTER:

 Just one last question, Oxfam/Community Aid Abroad have also put out a report today - you’re swamped by reports - and they’re saying, they’ve described the Pacific solution as a costly diversion. Saying taxpayers, as you know the figures, $141 million 2001/2002, they’ve called again for the end of mandatory sentencing. Would you agree with that?

 ATTORNEY:

 I don’t know about the report, I haven’t been briefed on it so I can’t make any comment. But I can say that it’s Government policy to maintain the policy of detention. Thank you.
