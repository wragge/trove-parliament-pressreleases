 DOORSTOP INTERVIEW   

 Montefiore Hill, Adelaide   

 1pm 31 January 2005

 Senator Hill: 

 The election in Iraq is obviously a tremendous achievement for the Iraqi people.   The courage that they’ve shown, their determination to take this opportunity  towards freedom and democracy is really an inspiration.  Further more it’s a credit  to all of those who’ve supported them in the most difficult of circumstances, the  countries that have made up the Multi-National Force - some who’ve suffered  greatly, of course the United States has lost over 1400 military personnel alone  apart from contractors.  But never the less this expression of democracy wouldn’t  have been possible without the support of the international force and they should  all receive credit.  Of course from the perspective of an Australian and an Australian  Government Minister, I particularly pay credit to the Australian officials and  military personnel who’ve played their part in assisting the Iraqi people to this stage  in their democratic process.  But above all it’s a victory for the Iraqi people who  have stood up to this very cruel and violent insurgency and have shown that  despite the fact that they run the risk of being killed, their families being  maltreated, they’re never the less going to seize this opportunity. It gives us  confidence that as we go through a challenging year ahead in terms of establishing  their transitional government, drawing up their new constitution and finally  towards the end of this year another election towards full and distinct sovereignty   that they will in fact achieve their goals. 

 Journalist: 

 Minister, now that the election has come, is coming and going, and has seen to go  according to plan, is there any notion now that foreign troops will be out including  our troops. 

 Senator Hill: 

 Well this is primarily up to the Iraqi people through their leadership and whilst  there is no doubt that they wouldn’t wish foreign troops to stay longer than is  necessary, in the same way that this first election wouldn’t have been possible  without the support of the Multi-National Force, is suspect they will say that the  processes that are to follow during the course of this year will still require the  presence of international military support.  They’re building up their own security  capabililties, their own security forces.  It seems that their security forces took the  primary responsibility for guarding polling booths worked well during the last few  days - which is another sign of confidence in their future.  But they will be the first

 to acknowledge that they’ve still got a way to go to have in place a security force  that they are confident can adequately deal with the insurgency. 

 Journalist: 

 The Iraqi Interior Minister has said that the United States troops could be out in 18  months time. Is that an overly optimistic timeframe in your view? 

 Senator Hill: 

 Well the current UN Security Council mandate talks about the need for an  international force to protect the processes during the course of this year up until  the next elections for a sovereign Iraq.  So they’ve taken it that far and no doubt the  Security Council will continue to consider it during the course of the... 

 Journalist: 

 He said US troops should be out in 18 months time. 

 Senator Hill: 

 Yeah I know, but what I’m saying is the Security Council reflecting the view of the  international community as a whole has talked about at least a 12-month timetable  it hasn’t looked beyond the 12 months.  And what I’m saying is that no doubt they  will continue to address that during the course of this year, and really is will  depend on how matters develop on the ground. 

 Journalist: 

 Do you think it is overly optimistic, 18 months for the US? 

 Senator Hill: 

 I don’t think it is overly optimistic to talk in terms of a significant reduction of  forces - about 140,000 or more US forces are there at the moment - and they may  well be able to significantly reduce that number is another 18 months.  It really  depends on the pace of development of Iraq’s own security forces and the process of  its transition to government, the economic reconstruction, the confidence of the  Iraqi people and that will depend on what happens during the course of this year. 

 Journalist: 

 Given that, what do you see as being optimistic for the Australian troops being  there, or realistic? 

 Senator Hill: 

 Well realistically Australian troops will be there for some time.  And I’ve talked  about the key function of building the Iraqi Security Forces.  We are still playing a  part in building the new Iraqi Army and I think there’s going to be a need for that  for some considerable period? 

 Journalist: 

 But is that months or years? 

 Senator Hill: 

 We provide support for our Government officials, they wouldn’t be able to work  there without ADF support, and I think that will be necessary for some time.  The  other sort of functions - the transport functions, medical assistance, air traffic  control - these functions are gradually being assumed by Iraqi authority, and the  sooner they can put in place an Iraqi alternative - whether it be civilian or military -  the better.  So we haven’t put a strict timetable on it, as you know we will stay for

 as long as we believe that there is a need, an important role for Australia to play  and the Iraqi leadership want us to stay. 

 Journalist: 

 Has the success of the election had any impact on that possible timetable? 

 Senator Hill: 

 Well it’s a big step in the right direction, but as I’ve said before, this coming year is  still going to be a very challenging year.  The insurgency won’t be easily defeated,  but hopefully they’ve noted the message that the overwhelming majority of the Iraqi  people not only want democracy and freedom, but further more are prepared to put  their own lives on the line to achieve those goals.  So it’s a big step in the right  direction, but it is still going to be a challenging year for the Iraqi people. 

 Journalist: 

 The big turn out, will it demoralise some of those insurgents or do you think it will  fire them up? 

 Senator Hill: 

 The insurgency is complex.  If you talk about the Jihadists for example, I don’t  think it will make any difference to them because they basically see themselves  fighting a holy war.  If you talk about some of the more extreme elements that were  part of the old Baathist regime, the secret police and the like, they are likely to be  unaffected.  But in terms of those who may have been swept up by the insurgency,  particularly in Sunni areas, and have in some way felt threatened by the democratic  process, I hope that they will note not only the wishes of the Iraqi people - and what  seems to have been quite a strong vote in Baghdad itself - but I also hope, and I do  believe that the new transitional government will take steps to ensure that those  who are concerned by democracy but never the less are not fighters are drawn  within the political process and that they will also see a future for themselves in a  democratic Iraq.  And I think that that will be the political challenge of this year  which will run in parallel to the security challenge. 

 Journalist: 

 You spoke of the task that the Australian Army have to do over there, has their load  been lightened by the decision to shut the embassy and shift it to the green zone? 

 Senator Hill: 

 Not as such, it may vary.  What we’re doing at the moment is assessing the future  role for the Security Detachment.  It will for the time being remain in its current  premises, which is a very secure building, and it will guard and protect Australian  assets.  They will continue to provide safe transport for Australian officials as  they’ve been doing so far.  But in the longer term that will be assessed depending  how long the officials remain out at Presidential Palace North, what will be their  security environment within the green zone and matters of that nature. 

 Journalist: 

 But you expect it will change? 

 Senator Hill: 

 Well it’ll change, the green zone is still not a safe zone.  As you saw in the last few  days the American Embassy was attacked by indirect fire and American lives were  lost.  But there is a lesser chance of a direct attack, as opposed to an indirect  attack when in the green zone, so that might change the role for our security

 detachment and those issues are under consideration at the moment but they will  take some time to... 

 Journalist: 

 Is there scope then for a possible reduction in the number of combat troops being  used in relation to protection purposes given that the embassy is going to be at  Camp Victory which is more secure than the present situation, and then following  that moving to the green zone? 

 Senator Hill: 

 Well Defence have started an assessment of that.  Basically the professionals will  advise what level and what type of force construct is necessary to protect Australian  lives and Australian interests.  Certainly the force that’s been put in place reflects  the Australian officials presence in the existing Embassy, so that might change  when they’re in a new premises in the green zone.  But the transport task I can’t  see significantly changing because they will still need to move around in Baghdad.   So we have about 120 at the moment Defence personnel involved in that security  role, this assessment.... 

 Journalist: 

 About 85 of those are combat troops? 

 Senator Hill: 

 Infantry could be around that figure.  An assessment will be made by the  professionals as to whether that is the correct level to protect Australian lives in the  future in their new occupational circumstances.  But that won’t be decided for some  little time. 

 Journalist: 

 So why change the arrangements for the Embassy at this point, there have been a  number of incidents, why now? 

 Senator Hill: 

 There have been signs as you know that the Embassy may be being specifically  targeted.  There was the bombing outside in particular, and there have been some  firing on the Security Detachment building adjoining the Embassy, but most people  talk of it as one.  There has been some sniper firing at it and there’s been the  occasional rocket or mortar firing, and whilst it’s a very well protected environment  and it’s served its purpose - Australian officials have been well secured by it - never  the less the assessment has been made that a move into the green zone might be  even safer.  We always intended of course to re-establish the Embassy in the green  zone, what’s now being done is an attempt to accelerate that process. 

 Journalist: 

 How long will that transition take? 

 Senator Hill: 

 Well we’re trying to do it as quickly as possible but the decision that’s been taken is  that in the mean time the officials will be protected at Presidential Palace North.  So  in terms of their safety it doesn’t really matter. 

 Journalist: 

 Alexander Downer attacked Kim Beazley for talking about this last week as  scandalous and cutting and running the face of terrorists, how come Labor

 suggesting moving the diplomats to the green zone is cutting and running in the  face of terrorists, and you announcing today or it happening, the Government  deciding it is going to do it is prudent reaction to the realities of life in Baghdad? 

 Senator Hill: 

 Well the Embassy was always being moved into the green zone.  Our problem as  you know has been to get the construction work done because of the security  environment - very difficult to get construction workers in Baghdad at the moment.   But we made a decision some little time ago to move the personnel to Presidential  Palace North and we thought that was a prudent step to take.  I’ve always said we  review the security environment constantly, we take into account what’s being seen  on the ground and what our intelligence people are telling us and so we took that  prudent step.  So I think what Alex was really referring to was whether it was  prudent to be talking about the detail at that time. 

 Journalist: 

 Can give us an update on the condition of the Australian soldiers that were injured  last week and whether they might be repatriated to Darwin? 

 Senator Hill: 

 The two that seemed to be more seriously injured have been transferred to Germany  for further treatment.  A final decision hasn’t been taken as to whether they will be  repatriated to Australia, but generally they are.  If we have had someone injured  that have gone to Germany for further treatment then the next step has been  Australia.  But I understand they are in good condition considering their injuries. 

 Journalist: 

 So it is likely they will come back to Australia? 

 Senator Hill: 

 That is likely.  There was a third soldier who was injured with shrapnel injuries that  originally weren’t assessed as as serious, but on further reflection a decision was  taken to repatriate him to Australia, so he will be returning to Australia without  going to Germany. 

 Journalist: 

 Can I ask you one quick final question, it may be a bit left field, but a Western  Australian organisation project safe.com or what ever it’s called...  they’re involved  in refugee issues and what have you... they’re claiming today that Christmas Island  is likely to become an American base that the Government is spending more money  on it.  Is Christmas Island likely to become an American base? 

 Senator Hill: 

 No. Never heard that suggestion. 

 Journalist: 

 Just quickly, about that incident in Sydney over night... shootings... that is believed  to be linked to the Iraqi elections... 

 Senator Hill: 

 No I haven’t.... 

 Journalist: 

 

 

 6

 The shooting incident in Sydney West overnight, connecting it to tensions within  Iraqis in Australia? 

 Senator Hill: 

 Well I think that all I can say is that Iraqis living in Australia seem to have been  thrilled with the opportunity to express a democratic choice.  I’m glad expatriates  were given that opportunity.  And the history of migration to Australia is that when  people migrate to Australia they leave the ways of their homeland behind in terms  of settling issues through violence, it’s not the Australian way and I would be  amazed if there was any connection. 

 Journalist: 

 Just about that third soldier, why was he not sent to Germany and sent straight  back to Australia? 

 Senator Hill: 

 I assume because he didn’t require the sort of follow up from surgery that the other  two did.  The other two received surgery and the normal process is they go on to  Germany for specialised treatment after that.  His shrapnel wounds, as I  understand it, weren’t regarded as requiring that but never the less it was decided  that for the long term management of those wounds he’d be better off in Australia  and so he will be back soon. 

 Journalist: 

 (Inaudible) 

 Senator Hill: 

 Well there were ten people injured who we say were injured in some way... but it  depends on the definition of injuries, some of them have had a bit of hearing  difficulties and that type of thing, so the last figure I had is that ten were injured  but really only three required ongoing treatment.  Two were in Germany in the  moment, one is on his way back to Australia. 

 Journalist: 

 The other seven... 

 Senator Hill: 

 I think they’re back at work.
