 ADDRESS BY SENATOR GARETHf EVANSJAUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR  FOREIGN AFFAIRS AT OPENING OFTHE^RED HOUlOWSVOUl^DAWON  INTRA-OCULAR FACTORY, ASMARA. ERITREA, 'Î ^ Î ) 20 JANUARY 1994 . 

 -V z cV\ vv v

 This is a joyful day, and an historic day, and I feel privileged, and very grateful to  the Government of Eritrea and the Fred Hollows Foundation, to be able to share  it with you.

 The factory we are opening today stands as a testament to the power of a  determined individual to make a profound impression on the lives and well-being  of others.

 Fred Hollows's contribution began with a commitment at a personal level to try to  help those suffering from blindness and other health problems. He began work  on a small scale in Australia, and then extended that work successively to a 

 number of other countries in different regions - Eritrea, Nepal and Vietnam. Fred  Hollows's work in Eritrea and Asia was far from home. But in its humanity, and  in its response to compelling human needs, it was a natural extension of his  long-standing commitment to improving the sight of Australian Aboriginal people. 

 He was a great Australian of whom his country is truly proud. His dedication to  the common good, his personal courage and sheer determination, and his  capacity for friendship with people from many cultures, were all reflections of a  large and generous spirit of which any country would be proud.

 From his work has grown the Fred Hollows Foundation, an impressive  organisation and a remarkable body of people bringing caring and expertise to  bear on a much wider range of problems. I pay tribute in this regard to Gabi  Hollows, who has carried on her late husband's work as Fred knew she would - 

 with an energy and spirit that would have made him very proud indeed.

 What has been crucial in Fred Hollows's work has been the way in which he at  all stages stimulated the enthusiasm and involvement of others and in particular  local people in the areas in which he has worked. We were deeply moved this

 morning to witness the operation by Dr Desbele in performing the first intra­ ocular implant from the new factory. His skill and commitment, and that of his  colleagues, were enormously impressive.

 We have also seen how the commitment of Fred Hollows to helping people  overcome blindness has stimulated others to do more in other fields. Many  Australian experts have been inspired by Fred's work to make their own  contributions in other fields in Eritrea and elsewhere, especially in health care. 

 In this country, for example, the maxillo-facial dental project is helping to repair  serious injuries, many of them caused by war. Dr Elizabeth Dax of the National  Reference Laboratory in Melbourne is working on a project to help Eritrea  respond to the problem of HIV/AIDS. And an Australian pharmacist is assisting  in developing a national drugs policy for the country.

 In all of these projects, Eritreans themselves are deeply involved. Their own  work will have lasting benefit and help establish them as the leaders in their  fields. They are the pioneers in this work in their own country. And others will  follow them. In relation to the particular project we are honouring today I 

 certainly see the day coming before too long when Eritrea itself will be the  regional centre for training and for selling locally-produced, inexpensive intra­ ocular lenses, restoring sight not only to people in this country, but to others  throughout the region.

 It is of course not only to be present at this opening that 1  am pleased to be  visiting Eritrea - and doing so in your very early days as an independent country. 

 The achievement of that independence, after long and bloody sacrifice by the  Eritrean people, was welcomed around the world. We in Australia were very  conscious of your struggle, and of the courage, determination and pride that  fortified you through so many years of terrible conflict.

 We in Australia were very pleased for you when Eritrea at last gained its  independence. We were also greatly impressed that this was achieved, after so 

 much sacrifice, in a democratic way through a fully free and fair referendum,  endorsed as such by the international community, of the Eritrean people.

 The observers that we sent to the referendum - senior members of the Australian  Parliament, and Australian community leaders - returned to Australia with high  praise for the spirit of commitment to national reconstruction that we ourselves  can see all around us today.

 There is continuing very great interest in Australia in Eritrea's future and we look  forward to developing our relations in a number of practical ways.

 Apart from emergency relief, our development assistance focus on Africa has, I  think appropriately, emphasised those areas in which we have a comparative  advantage. We have special skills, for example, in minerals exploration and  development, in medical and health technology and in dry-land agriculture, all of 

 which I think are of particular importance to Eritrea.

 The construction of this factory is an outstanding example of the contribution  Australians can make in the field of public health. In another field - minerals  exploration - 1  am very happy to have the opportunity during my present visit of  signing a joint Memorandum of Understanding with the Eritrean Government 

 which will involve spending almost half a million dollars in specifically targeted  geological survey work.

 Australia's commitment to the reconstruction of Eritrea is demonstrated through  a substantial increase in our assistance this year to $6 million - at a time when  budgetary pressures have forced us to cut back aid allocations almost  everywhere else in Africa, Australia is helping Eritrea deal with major needs - 

 food, primary health care, agricultural rehabilitation, assistance with returning  refugee programs and the demobilisation of soldiers.

 At least as important as government efforts in building links between our two  peoples are the activities undertaken by Australian institutions (like the  University of New South Wales, which has begun building links with the  University of Asmara) and non-governmental organisations. Some of the major  Australian NGOs operating in Eritrea have been the Food Security Working 

 Group, Austcare, World Vision Australia and UNICEF Australia. Other NGOs  have been active in rural development, especially the

 Australian Council of Churches, Australian Catholic Relief and the International  Womens' Development Agency.

 I should also mention the very great commitment of the Royal College of  Pathologists, the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia and the Australian  Dentists' Association who have worked hard on the ground to develop local skills  in public health, drugs policy and the provision of basic dental services in 

 Eritrea.

 Not the least outstanding example of Australian NGO activity has been the  dedication and sheer hard work of Steve Murphy and Sam Stewart of the  Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief (REDR), and of their colleagues Ian 

 Hickling and Ray Avery, in the construction of this factory.

 Despite the distances that separate us, I am coming to see that Australians and  Eritreans have a lot in common. We are both peoples used to harsh  environments and to having to find practical solutions to the problems that  confront us. We tend to roll our sleeves up, staying cheerful and resourceful in  the face of adversity, and get on with the job.

 Fred Hollows was certainly just such a person. He wasn't content to dwell on  problems, but was driven to seek their solutions. His response to the challenges  he saw in both our countries, was not only a human and a humane one which 

 contributed enormously to alleviation of individual human suffering^ but it has  helped to bring Australians and Eritreans closer together.
