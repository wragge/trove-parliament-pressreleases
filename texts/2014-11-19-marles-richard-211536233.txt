 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 AUSTRALIA MUST NOT SHIRK ITS REGIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES   

 The Abbott Government’s announcement that it will no longer take refugees from  Indonesia after July 1 of this year raises serious questions about the implementation of  Australia’s humanitarian program.   

 Labor will be holding urgent talks with the UNHCR about this change, as well as seeking  a briefing from the Australian Government about what expert advice this decision has  been based upon.   

 There are also significant questions around what dialogue Immigration Minister Scott  Morrison has had with his Indonesian counterpart about this decision.   

 Regional co-operation is critical to having a long-term sustainable solution to the issue  of displaced people in South-East Asia. We simply cannot shirk our regional  responsibility.    

 Labor believes Australia has an obligation to be a generous and humane country and  we need to be working co-operatively with our neighbours to tackle people smuggling.   

 Under Labor,  Australia’s  humanitarian intake was set at 20,000 places - that number  has been slashed by the Abbott Government to 13,750 - against the advice of the  Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers.
