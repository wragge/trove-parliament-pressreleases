 STEVE GEORGANAS MP  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR HINDMARSH   

 MEDIA STATEMENT   

 CROSS PARTY WORKING GROUP ON REFUGEES   

 Today MPs participating in the Cross Party Working Group on Refugees  noted the continuing loss of asylum seeker lives at sea.   

 They agreed that:    

 1. The issue is a complex one in which the protection of human life  should be paramount.   

 2. A durable and humane way forward will be to work with our  neighbours to establish some form of regional architecture for the  assessment and resettlement of refugees.    

 3. The reinvigoration of the Bali Process is a positive development,  including the participation of Canada, as is the development of the  UNHCR's discussion paper, Regional Cooperative Approach to Address  Refugees, Asylum Seekers and Irregular Movement.   

 They committed to:   

 1. Taking further advice from experts in the refugee and asylum seeker  sector with a view to creating a space for agreement on a policy that can  be agreed to by the Parliament.    

 2. To reconvene on Monday 6 August in Melbourne.
