 Michael Organ MP  Greens Member for Cunningham   

 MEDIA RELEASE   11 August 2004   

 

 HOWARD THROWS AWAY THE KEY     

   Prime Minister Howard stunned members of the House of 

 Representatives in question time today when he failed to rule out the  indefinite detention of asylum seekers.    

   In a cold and heartless response to a question from the 

 Australian Greens Member for Cunningham, the Prime Minister refused to  assure the community that no person would be indefinitely detained in  Australia’s immigration prisons.   

   “I was shocked by the Prime Minister’s officious remark 

 that ‘the laws of Australia will be upheld’, not missing a beat to  consider how he would apply the Government’s new found power to detain  people without charge forever.”    

   “It appears the Prime Minister and his Government have no 

 qualms about letting people rot in the hell holes that are Australia’s  immigration prisons,” Mr Organ said.   

   “The Prime Minister’s remark is inconsistent with those of  Minister Vanstone.  At least the Minister has undertaken to review all  long term detention cases. The Prime Minister missed the point and  misses the boat on decency.” 

 

   “When I spoke to 6 year detainee Peter Qasim only this 

 Tuesday I was horrified by the deterioration of his condition.  Detention has severe adverse impacts upon the physical and mental well  being of the men, women and children imprisoned by this Government.”    

   “The Prime Minister must act at once to bring an end to 

 this gross abuse of human rights. The law which is bringing shame upon  this nation must be repealed,” Michael Organ said.
