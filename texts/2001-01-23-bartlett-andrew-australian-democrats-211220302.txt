 Senator Andrew Bartlett Senator for Queensland Australian Democrats spokesperson for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

 Press Release Dated: 23 Jan 2001 Press Release Number: 01/31 Portfolio: Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

 Democrats opposed to Ruddock’s Plans for Detention Centre Crackdowns The Australian Democrats will strongly oppose any Government moves to make it easier to expel asylum seekers and have called on the ALP not to support the Government's attacks on human rights.

 Democrats’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said people should not be given a potential death sentence as punishment for being involved in disturbances in detention centres.

 “Australia has an obligation as a signatory to the Convention Against Torture not to return people to a place where they face a real risk of being tortured or killed,” Senator Bartlett said.

 “The Democrats will not support any moves which will further weaken the human rights of asylum seekers and are very concerned at ALP comments which suggest support for Mr Ruddock's proposals."

 “There are already strong laws in place to deal with those who cause damage to property or people. Giving stronger punishments to asylum seekers than anyone else would set an appalling human rights precedent,” Senator Bartlett said.

 “There would be far fewer problems in centres if there was a six month maximum on detention.

 “People who have already faced great stress and uncertainty are frustrated at spending long periods in overcrowded detention centres while their status is assessed. Crackdowns and the increased use of sedation will make a bad situation worse.

 “Minister Ruddock’s suggestions that sedatives might be more widely used on detainees should be strongly opposed,” Senator Bartlett said.

 “There have already been allegations made about inappropriate use of sedatives and other improper actions by detention centre guards. There must be no increase in the powers of detention centre guards before there has been independent investigation of

 these allegations.

 “No asylum seeker should be locked up in a detention centre for longer than six months, except in exceptional circumstances. Six months is enough time to check that a person is not a health or security risk, even if their application for residency is still being considered.

 “Keeping detainees sedated is not the way to deal with unrest. The Government's mandatory detention policy is not working,” Senator Bartlett said.

 The Democrats have said they will support moves to house women and children in accommodation outside detention centres, a proposal the Government is considering.
