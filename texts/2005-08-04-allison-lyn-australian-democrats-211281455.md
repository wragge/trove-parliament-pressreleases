 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA      (05/388)     THURSDAY 4 AUGUST 2005  SENATOR LYN ALLISON  AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS LEADER   

 MENTAL HEALTH STIGMA WORSENING: INQUIRY HEARS  The National Mental Health Inquiry will today hear of a "state of crisis" in mental health services and how our  treatment of people with a mental illness, along with refugees, is exacerbated by the prejudices of the Federal  Government, said committee chair Senator Lyn Allison. 

 The Australian Democrats Leader said a submission to the Inquiry from the Office of the Public Advocate -  Queensland highlights the culture of suspicion and exclusion existing in Australia in regard to mental illness. 

 The organisation, which provides advocacy for adults with a decision-making disability, writes of a "state of  crisis" in mental health "characterised by the routine inability" of mentally ill people to access services, and of  the "routinely shabby treatment" received by people exiting treatment services.   

 "â€¦the actions of the Commonwealth Government have further eroded the already tenuous position of such  vulnerable groups in our community," the submission states, while also noting, "our treatment of refugees and  our treatment of citizens with mental illness are linked by an encompassing prejudice promoted by the  Commonwealth Government". 

 Senator Allison said the Public Advocate is not alone in the 500-plus submissions received by the committee,  in asserting that the stigma surrounding mental health is getting worse. 

 "Along with the common themes of wide-spread neglect, inadequate services and an immediate need for a  national mental health solution, is the continuing theme that people with a mental illness frequently feel  fragmented from the rest of the community," Senator Allison said. 

 In its submission, Origins Incorporated explores the mental health trauma of people separated by adoption.  The submission details the psychiatric effect of 'adoption surrender' on mothers and the mental health  damage to the adopted child as well as the lack of accountability from state governments. 

 And, Sisters Inside, advocates for the human rights of women in the criminal justice system in Queensland,  assert that "prisons are increasingly becoming the default placement for people with mental disabilities".  

 The hearings will be held in Brisbane today and Cairns tomorrow. More information is available at  http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/committee/mentalhealth_ctte/index.htm
