 Senator Amanda Vanstone  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS 

 More Migrants Settle in Regional Tasmania

 VPS 017/2004

 Launceston, Burnie and Nugent are among the many towns in Tasmania where more and more migrants are choosing to settle.

 But we need to do more and the initiatives I announced today with the Acting Prime Minister, John Anderson, will help to  attract more migrants and refugees to Australia's regional areas. 

 At the last Census, some 5,549 people living in Launceston were born overseas, of whom a majority was born in England and  New Zealand.

 In Burnie, some 1,396 people were born overseas. Of those, a majority was born in England and Scotland.

 In Nugent in the Glamorgan/Spring Bay area, some 352 people were born overseas, a majority of whom were from England  and New Zealand.

 In 2002-2003, some 200 visas were granted to people under State-specific and regional migration initiatives for Tasmania.

 This is more than double the outcome of the 2001-02 financial year. 

 Since 1997-98 some 830 visas have been granted to people who were planning to settle in Tasmania under the various  regional migration programs.

 Visa grants for regional areas are steadily increasing, but more can be done to assist regional Australia to get the people they  want and this is what the measures being announced today aim to do.

 From 1 July, qualified people who want to come to Australia as skilled migrants will be able to obtain a three-year temporary  residence visa if they commit to living and working in regional Australia. After two years they will be able to apply for  permanent residency.

 There is also a new visa for self-funded independent retirees to encourage them to settle in regional areas.

 Under this visa, participating state and territory governments will be able to sponsor self-funded retirees settling in regional  Australia. 

 Self-funded retirees provide an opportunity for Australia to benefit both from their capital investment and the money they  spend while in Australia.
