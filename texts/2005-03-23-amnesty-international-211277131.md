  The impact of  indefinite detention  the case to change australia’s  mandatory detention regime 

  Preliminary report - 23 March 2005 

  ‘...the right to individual liberty is one of the most@ndamental qfhuman rights.  lndejnite detention without trial wholly negates that right for an indeJinite period’  Lord Nicholls, UK House of Lords’ 

  ‘We came to a country we heard has human rights and$eedom. We can ’t believe  what s happening to us.. . . We haven ’t any human rights. We are just like animals.  We do not have a normal llfe like a human. Our feeling is dead. Our thinkmg is dead.  We are very sad about everything. We can ’t smile. ’ 

  Ibrahim Ishreti, asylum seeker 

  Ibrahim Ishreti fled persecution in search of safety in Australia. His hope for freedom  turned into more than four years of detention, bridging visas, bureaucracy and despair  He is among thousands of men, women and children who been held for anywhere  from six days to six years under Australia’s immigration detention regime. 

  Amnesty International’s report Impact of Indejnite Detention addresses how  Australia’s mandatory detention policy leads to the indefinite detention of asylum  seekers and refugees. In doing so, Australia is depriving these people of their right to  liberty, without legal justification or access to an effective alternative. In considering 

  Australia’s international human rights obligations towards asylum seekers and  refugees, it is clear that Australia’s detention policy and its justifications are invalid.

  The report presents the case for change to Australia’s mandatory detention regime,  providing recommendations to the Australian Government which would bring an end  to the indefinite detention of asylum seekers and, in doing so, restore Australia as a  nation that respects the human rights of some of the world’s most vulnerable people. 

  An unlawful practice 

  The indefinite detention without charge or trial of any person, including refugees and  asylum seekers, and without due process of law is prohibited under international  la^.^  Under Australia’s mandatory detention regime, all asylum seekers who arrive without  proper documentation are detained pending assessment of their case. Their detention  will only end if they are granted a visa or removed or deported to another country. 

  Recent decisions of the Australian High Court confirm that under Australia’s  mandatory detention policy an asylum seeker may effectively be condemned to  indefinite detention - a life sentence without charge, trial or access to an effective  remedy. 

  This is a result that neither the Australian people nor its Parliament should accept. 

  The right to seek asylum 

  Hope was never meant to be a life sentence. By coming to Australia to escape the  persecution that forced them to leave their homes, asylum seekers are exercising their  right to seek asylum. 

  Instead, if they arrive without adequate documentation they face mandatory detention.  Their detention can be prolonged if not indefinitely in the absence of any independent  review or any set time limit for their detention. It is untenable that the right to seek  asylum in Australia from human rights abuses in other countries should be met by a 

  system that further violates human rights. 

  The psychologcal impact of indefinite detention is irrefutable. Amnesty International  continues to receive allegations of the physical and mental mistreatment of detainees  held in Australian immigration detention centres. Reports of hunger strikes, suicide  attempts, riots and protests are symptomatic of the complete disempowerment of 

  human beings denied any effective remedy to their arbitrw detention. 

  In January 2005, 545 asylum seekers were detained in Australian immigration  detention centres. This does not include those detained in Australia’s immigration  facilities on N a m  of which there were an additional 54 as at March 2005, including  48 adults and six children. 

  Peter Qasim is Australia’s longest senring immigration detainee. A Kashmiri asylum  seeker, he has been in detention since September 1998. He is defined as a ’stateless 

  See for example, United Nations, Economic and Social Council, Siracusa Principles on thc 1.imitation  and Dcrogation Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1J.N. Doc.  E/CN.4/1985/4, Annex (1985), Principle 70.

  person’ because no country will accept him as their national. Additionally no country  will allow him to reside within their borders. In August 2004, the High Court of  Australia, by a narrow majority, ruled that under Australia’s mandatory detention  legislation it is permissible to detain him for the rest of his life. 

  An arbitrary practice 

  Amnesty International is of the opinion that Australia’s detention policy may be  considered arbitrary as it is not subject to judicial review, it is for an indeterminate  period of time, it is discriminatory and it is without reference to the particular  circumstance of the individual’s case. 

  The UNHCR considers detention to be arbitrary where that detention is not subject to  either administrative or judicial re vie^.^ The U ” C R  is of the view that ‘there should  be prompt, mandatory and periodic review of all detention orders before an  independent and impartial body’. Article 9(4) of the ICCPR provides that: 

  “[alnyone who is deprived of his [sic] liberty by arrest or detention shall be  entitled to take proceedmgs before a court, in order that that court may decide  without delay on the lawfulness of his [sic] detention and order his [sic]  release if the detention is not lawful.” 

  In A v Australia the UN Human kghts Committee upheld A’s submission that there  was no effective review of the grounds for detention of asylum seekers in Australian  courts in breach of Article 9(4) of the ICCPR 

  Indefinite detention 1s a form of arbitrary detention and should be seen within that  context. Amnesty International finds that Australia’s mandatory detention policy  allows for detention that is both indefinite and arbitrary. 

  Although indefinite detention is not the same as arbitrary detention, as concepts they  overlap. Indefinite detention without charge or trial, that is not protected by due  process, will always be arbitrary and therefore in breach of Article 9 of the  International Covenant on Civil and Political kghts. It will be inappropriate, unjust  and lacking in predictability. 

  On the other hand, in order to be arbitrary, detention does not have to be indefinite. In  both respects, the individual’s right to liberty and freedom from arbitrary detention  are violated. 

  A deterrent effect? 

  The Australian Government attests that its mandatory detention policy is intended to  act as a deterrent but denies that it is therefore punitive. Amnesty International  believes this to be an incorrect characterisation of Australia’s detention regime, which  is considered to unjustly penalise asylum seekers and refugees and as such is punitive 

  ’ Executive Conimittce of the IJNIICR, Detention ofAqduni SeekerL\ atidRefugees l h e  Franzenorh, the Problenr atidKeconinietidedPractice, 4 June 1999, CCi49iSCICKP 13, para 16  3 

  in both purpose and e f f e ~ t . ~  As such, it breaches Article 3 1 ( 1 )  of the Refugee  Convention.  “The detention of refirgees and asylum seekers is never an appropriate  solution to their plight. The power to detain must be related to a recognized 

  object or purpose, and there must be a reasonable relationship of  proportionality between the end and the means. Detention as part of a  program o ‘human deterrence’ is unlikely ever to be either legitimate or  humane. ’’ f 

  While the High Court of Australia has found Australia’s mandatory detention regime  not to be punitive, in its considerations the High Court has interpreted the regime  independently of Australia’s international human rights obligations. 

  Aside from the question of whether or not indefinite detention is in itself punitive,  there is considerable evidence which indicates that detention practices regularly  assume a punitive character. Amnesty International continues to receive reports of  human rights abuses in Australian immigration detention centres. Allegations include  the placement of people in isolation as a ‘punishment’ for alleged behaviour or for 

  disobeying the orders of detention centre staff.‘ 

  It is unacceptable that such serious allegations of mistreatment in Australia should be  beyond the reach and scrutiny of the courts. 

  Vulnerable groups 

  A consequence of Australia’s mandatory detention policy is that even the most  vulnerable asylum seekers can be detained indefinitely, regardless of their individual  circumstances. 

  Amnesty International argues that the psychological impact of detention is  compounded when no clear justification is given and when no end is in sight. For  those asylum seekers who have already witnessed or experienced grave human rights  abuses, such as torture, rape or the killing of a loved one, the impact of detention can 

  be devastating.

  Immigration, Gerry Hand, told the House of Represcntativcs:  When introducing the original mandatory detention bill on 5 May 1992, the then Minister for  The Government is determined that a clear signal be sent that migration to Australia may not be  achieved by simply arriving in this country and expecting to be allowed into the community.  On 19 February 2002, the then Minister for Immigration, Multicultural, and Indigenous Affairs, Philip  Ruddock, told the Australian parliament: 

  Late last year, ... we were able to pass certain laws which strengthened our territorial integrity. This  strategy has been successful in deterring potential illegal immigrants from making their way to  Australia.  Most recently, the Immigration Mmister, Senator Amanda Vanstone, in a joint media release with the  Attorney-General the Hon. Philip Ruddock M P  on 13 May 2004 in response to the HRTiOC Report, 

  said that an immigration policy that did not include the detention of children:  . . .would in practice encourage the inclusion of children in people smuggling operations.  Guy S.

  Amnesty International is concerned when any government has the power to detain a  person indefinitely. Such concerns are even more serious when vulnerable groups are  at risk including:  stateless people; 

  children;  family groups; and,  0 ‘Pacific solution’ detainees. 

  The human cost of indefinite detention 

  Amnesty International finds that Australia’s mandatory detention policy, in law and in  practice, violates a number of its human rights obligations under international  instruments include:  0 the International Covenant on Civil and Political kghts: Amnesty 

  International finds that indefinite detention in Australia is arbitrary and  contravenes Article 9 of the ICCPR;  the Convention on the Rights of the Child: Amnesty International concurs  with the findings of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission 

  (HREOC) that the immigration detention of children in Australia breaches the  CRC in a number of respects and found violations of Articles 37(b), 37(d),  3(1), 37(c), 22(1), 6(2), 39, 37(a), 19(1), 24(1), 23(1), 20(1) ofthe CRC; and,  the Refugee Convention: In relation to indefinite detention, Amnesty 

  International finds that Australia’s mandatory detention regime is in violation  of Article 3 1( 1) of the Refugee Convention. This is because the necessity of  detention is not determined on an individual case by case basis and is  disproportionate, given the range of viable alternatives to achieve the same 

  end.

  Amnesty International is not satisfied that the Australian Government has examined  in any meaningful or serious way alternatives to detention as opposed to alternative  forms of detention. 

  The time to act is now 

  This report complements Amnesty International’s 1998 report, A Continuing Shame7.  which condemned Australia’s mandatory detention policy and called upon the  Australian Government to bring its policy in line with its international human rights  obligations. 

  While the High Court of Australia in Al-Kateb has since ruled that indefinite detention  is permissible under Australia’s mandatory detention legislation, the majority did not  consider the lawfulness of the practice in the context of international human rights  standards. The High Court did acknowledge that it was the Parliament of Australia  that passed mandatov detention legislation which has the power to change it.

  Three recent decisions by the UK House of Lords and the US Supreme Court,  countries with which Australia shares legal traditions, have found indefinite detention  without charge or trial to be reviewable by a court and contrary to fundamental legal  principles. 

  As Lord Hoffmann observed in the recent decision of the House of Lords regarding  indefinite detention:  “This is one of the most important cases which the House has had to decide in recent  years. It calls into question the very existence of an ancient liberty of which this 

  country has until now been very proud: freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention.  The power which the Home Secretary seeks to uphold is a power to detain people  indefinitely without charge or trial. Nothing could be more antithetical to the instincts  and traditions of the people of the United Kingdom.” 

  Amnesty International maintains that the High Court could and should have assessed  the validity of Australia’s mandatory detention policy in accordance with its human  rights obligations. 

  Amnesty International calls on the Australian Government to enact new legislation  without delay to amend the mandatory detention policy to prohibit the indefinite  detention of undocumented arrivals. 

  A model for change 

  This report provides recommendations to change Australia’s mandatory detention  policy and to safeguard against indefinite detention. 

  Amnesty International’s recommendations draw on a number of proposals that have  been put to the Australian Government by individual and coalitions of organisations,  including Amnesty International. The recommendations propose the abolition of  detention and, in the interim, measures that will at least mitigate the harm that it 

  causes . 

  As is clear from t h s  report and the international jurisprudence on which it draws,  Australia’s current mandatory detention policy is contrary to international law can  lead to the indefinite detention of asylum seekers. 

  Amnesty International acknowledges recent developments which include an increased  use of bridging visas (including Bridging Visa E), residential housing projects and  alternative places of detention. These developments appear to indicate the Australian  Government’s acknowledgement that its mandatory detention regime is unnecessarily  harsh. However, Amnesty International finds that these developments fail to 

  adequately address the question of indefinite detention. As discussed in Chapter 1 of  this report, Amnesty International maintains that Australia’s mandatory detention of  ‘unlawful non-citizens’ is punitive in both purpose and effect. 

  Recommendations for change 

  Amnesw International recommends that the Australian Government ensure that the  Migration Act is consistent with Australia’s international human rights obligations. 

  6 

  This requires amendments to the mandatory detention provisions of the Migration Act  that will bring an end to the indefinite detention of asylum seekers and refugees in  Australia. Detention should only take place within the strict guidelines established by  the UNHCR. 

  Amnesty International believes that implementation of its recommendations would  enable the Australian Government to strike a balance between the rights and needs of  individual asylum seekers and legitimate concerns to manage migration to Australia. 

  Amnesty International's recommendations are provided in two parts. Part A details  recommendations for an alternate system of immigration detention to replace  Australia's existing mandatoy detention policy. These recommendations build on  some of the recent Government initiated developments that have recognised the need  for alternatives to immigration detention centres. They also build upon 

  recommendations put forward by other organisations including the Refugee Council  of Australia, Justice for Asylum Seekers and A Just Australia. Amnesty International  urges the Government to implement these recommendations to end the indefinite  detention of asylum seekers and refugees in Australia. 

  The recommendations in Part B propose amendments to the current mandatory  detention policy. Amnesty International recommends that at a minimum the  Australian Government act on the recommendations in Part B to reduce the number of  long-term detainees and to better protect their human rights. 

  Implementation of the recommendations contained in Part A requires that the  Australian Government also acts upon the recommendations in Part B. 

  Part A: Recommendations to end indefinite detention 

  1. The Australian Government should immedlately establish a formal review process  to release all those remaining asylum seekers in detention in Australia and on  Nauru by:  0 expediting the grant of permanent protection to those asylum seekers who 

  in light of current information are determined to be refugees (including but  not limited to those Iranians who face persecution having converted to  Christianity). Detainees should be immediately released into the community  pending review; 

  providing bridging visas with rights and entitlements to those estimated 195  asylum seekers in mainland detention whose claims are yet to be  determined. Children and their families should be released into the  community as a matter of priority; and  0 providing a durable solution to stateless detainees as well as other detainees 

  who are determined not to be refugees but would face human rights abuses  if they were returned. This may take the form of complementary protection. 

  In exceptional circumstances, release of existing asylum seeker detainees may be  subject to health, security and identity considerations. 

  2. There should be a presumption against the detention of asylum seekers for all  future unauthorised arrivals. As soon as an unauthorised asylum seeker arrives in 

  7 

  Australia, the asylum seeker should be informed of their rights, including the right  to free and independent legal counsel, and an assessment of their individual  circumstances carried out by a properly trained immigration officer. An asylum  seeker should only be detained if, at the end of the initial individualised 

  assessment, there are:  reasonable concerns as to their identity or the elements of the asylum claim, or  there are reasonable grounds to believe they are attempting to mislead the  authorities or are a threat to national security. 

  The initial assessment should include whether the asylum seeker is a child, in  particular an unaccompanied child, stateless or vulnerable in any other way. The  asylum seeker may be detained for a strictly limited period prescribed by law for  the purposes of conducting these checks and subject to regular review. 

  There should be clear guidelines for all decision makers as to the circumstances in  which an asylum seeker can be considered to be a threat to national security. The  guidelines should provide, inter alia, that where security concerns can be  adequately addressed by imposing reporting requirements, detention should be  considered unnecessary and bridging visas may be granted. 

  3. On arrival to Australia, all asylum seekers should, unless where detention is  deemed to be necessary as set out above, be released into the community on  bridging visas. The bridging visa should provide for the following rights:  permission to work; 

  access to healthcare; 

  0 

  access to the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme; 

  Government funded specialist care based on their individual needs, including  torture and trauma assistance if appropriate; and,  Government funded ongoing casework support, including access to free  independent legal counsel. 

  4. If, as a consequence of the initial assessment, an asylum seeker is detained,  written reasons should be given for the initial decision to detain. There should be  an automatic, prompt, fair and independent review by a court, on a case by case  basis, of the merits and lawfulness of the detention and decision and the need to  continue that detention. If, in accordance with international human rights  standards, detention is found to be unnecessary, unreasonable or disproportionate  in the individual circumstances, the asylum seeker should be released into the  community on a bridging visa. 

  5 .  In all detention decisions, the onus should be on the authorities to show that  detention is necessary, reasonable and proportionate in the individual case. The  authorities should be required to provide details of which alternatives to detention  have been considered and the reasons, if any, why they would not suffice. The 

  simple fact of arriving unauthorised is not a permissible justification for detention. 

  6. There should be the possibility for the asylum seeker to apply at any time for  judicial review of decisions to detain. or not to detain as the case may be. There  should be an automatic periodic judicial review of the need for their detention to 

  8 

  7. 

  8. 

  9. 

  continue. Considerations as per Recommendation 4 (above) should be relied upon  in the determination. 

  Any asylum seekers who are detained in immigration detention centres at any  stage and for any length of time should be in urban and not remote areas, and  provided with appropriate access to education health-care, legal representation and  contact with communities that share their language, culture and religion. 

  If detention is found to be necessary, use of alternative places of detention and  residential housing projects should be considered for all detainees before resorting  to confinement in detention centres. Steps should be taken to ensure that  restrictions imposed in alternative places of detention and residential housing 

  projects are not unreasonable or oppressive. 

  An independent body should be appointed to review the detention centres which  consider the conditions of detention in detention centres, alternative places of  detention and residential housing projects, including surveillance and the use of  isolation. 

  10. Where conditions of release are necessary, any restrictions on movement and  interference with the privacy of asylum seekers held in alternative places of  detention should have to satisfy requirements of necessity, reasonableness, and  proportionality and should be reviewable by a court. 

  1 1 .  These recommendations should apply to all asylum seekers, including those  detained in immigration detention centres in Australia and on N a q  residential  housing projects and alternative places of detention. 

  As noted, implementation of the recommendations contained in Part A requires that  the Australian Government also acts upon the recommendations in Part B below. 

  Part B: Recommendations to amend the current mandatory detention  policy 

  1. 

  2. 

  3 .  

  The Australian Government should introduce legislation to establish and  implement the complementary protection proposal to provide for asylum seekers  who do not meet the strict criteria of the Refugee Convention but nonetheless  require international protection. 

  The Australian Government should treat all refugees without discrimination and  with full respect for their human rights regardless of their immigration status; any  distinctions between those that arrive in Australia under the onshore or the  offshore programmes, those that are documented, and those arriving  undocumented, must satisfy requirements of proportionality, necessity and  proscribed by law. 

  The independent oversight of the treatment of long term detainees in detention  centres should be increased by:  establishing community reference committees at all detention centres;

  restoring the power of HREOC to initiate contact with detainees;  promoting the transparency of the Immigration Detention Advisory Group  which should include regular provision of information to DIMIA and HREOC  on the conditions in immigration detention; 

  allowing greater access to detainees by health professionals, independent  observers and representatives of relevant religions; and,  ensuring that isolation is never be used for detainees who are suffering mental  illness or other serious medical conditions and that the use of isolation and  other conditions of detention should be reviewable by a court.

  If detention is necessary in an individual case, where a family is held in a  residential housing project, male members of those families, particularly fathers,  should also be detained in the RHPs with their families rather than being held  separately. 

  Where conditions of release are necessary or where restrictions on movement and  interference with the privacy of asylum seekers held in alternative places of  detention are considered necessary, such conditions or restrictions should have to  satis@ requirements of necessity, reasonableness, and proportionality and should  be reviewable by a court. 

  Detainees released on bridgmg visas should be accorded reasonable access to  work rights, social assistance, medical care and housing as well as education,  where appropriate. 

  Stateless asylum seekers should either be granted:  a complementary protection visa; or,  a bridging visa with benefits and family reunion rights that allows them to live  in the community in Australia, if necessary until effective protection in another  state can be found. If no such protection can be found withn a limited and  clearly defined period, they should be afforded permanent protection in  Australia. 

  S417 Ministerial Discretion should be available to those detainees who are  ultimately determined at the end of the process not to be refugees but are in fact  stateless. 

  The Australian Government should adopt the recommendations of the HREOC  report, A Last Resort, and Recommendation 2(iii) of the UN Working Group on  Arbitrary Detention Report in order for Australia to comply with its international  obligations under the Convention on the fights of the Child. 

  In relation to unaccompanied children the Australian Government should:  Release any unaccompanied chldren from immigration detention and pass  legislation to ban the practice of placing unaccompanied children in  immigration detention; 

  Create an independent body to ensure accountability in the supervision of  unaccompanied chldren, which would adhere to nationally agreed upon rights-  based guidelines; and, 

  As part of the Minister for Immigration’s obligations to unaccompanied  children, set a reasonable time limit on the processing of their asylum  applications. They should be prioritised over other asylum applications. 

  10. Regarding the ‘Pacific Solution’, the Australian Government should:  immediately grant visas to the remaining detainees on Nauru, which would  permit them to live in Australia until their status is finally determined or it is  announced by the UNHCR that it is safe for them to return to their country of  origin; 

  close Australia’s detention centre on Nauru and publicly commit to not  sending any asylum seekers or refugees who attempt to claim asylum in  Australia in the future to Nauru;  pending release of the detainees on Nauru are released, the Australian 

  Government should ensure that:  o an independent delegation of medical, legal and human rights experts visits  Nauru to assess the camps and the treatment of detainees; and  o those detainees who are considering return to their country of origin have 

  access to translation services, independent legal advice and all relevant up-  to-date country information before making any decision to return.
