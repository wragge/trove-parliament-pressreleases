  Government initiatives expand migrant's

  employment opportunities

  

  MPS 77/98 

  

  The Federal Government's commitment to assisting settl ers from 
other countries has been underscored by a range of recently announced 
initiatives including literacy and numeracy programs, specific language 
strategies, and job placement and employment programs. 

  

 Unveiled in the Federal 
Budget by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth 
Affairs, the new initiatives provide direct benefits to migrants. 

  

 The Minister for Immigration 
and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said the allocation of $12.6 
million over four years for a further 2,200 places under the Job Placement, 
Employment and Training (JPET) program is a key plank of this strategy. 

  

 "This program will 
assist young homeless people, including refugees, overcome problems 
that are preventing them participating successfully at school, training 
or in the employment market. 

  

 "The JPET program 
helps individuals aged between 15-21 who are homeless or at risk of 
becoming homeless, or refugees, overcome drug and alcohol abuse, family 
conflict and abuse, and helps them seek work or re-enter education. 

  

 "The Government 
has also committed an addition $42.6 million to the National Asian Languages 
and Studies in Australian Schools (NALSAS) Strategy. 

  

 "This initiative 
is important in developing an understanding of Asian languages and Asian 
cultures for Australian students. In 1997, approximately half of the 
24,000 students studying another language studied an Asian language".
