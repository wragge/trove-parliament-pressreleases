 TONY ABBOTT:  

 It’s good to be here in Thredbo, good to be here with my colleague Steve Ciobo and also with Senator Guy  Barnett. I’m very grateful to local tourism operators for the insights that they’ve given me into the tourism  industry. Tourism is the largest employer in this part of the Eden-Monaro area. It would be fair to say that  tourist operators feel a bit neglected by the state and federal governments. One of the big issues here,  particularly for this resort, is the cost of electricity. Electricity is one of the biggest costs that the Thredbo  resort faces and of course under Mr Rudd’s great big new tax on everything, should he proceed with it,  electricity prices will just go up and up. So, it was good to get the briefing. Some of the other issues that  were discussed include the difficulties in transition to so-called modern awards, government red tape and  regulation generally - this particular resort is subject to no fewer than 289 pieces of government legislation,  and just to give one example of the kind of costs that can so readily be imposed on people, they’re now  spending $4 million to upgrade their diesel tanks here in the Perisher Valley. This is something which is  costing small business hundreds of millions of dollars in New South Wales. It’s a perfectly reasonable  intention that the state government has to add to the level of environmental protection but it’s not as if we’ve  had a flood of leaks from diesel tanks and yet these are the costs which government can so easily, and often  it seems so casually, impose on businesses large and small.  

 There are a couple of other issues that I wouldn’t mind mentioning. We’ve got more boats coming -  notwithstanding the Government’s recent announcements - and certainly it would seem that people  smugglers’ actions speak much louder than Prime Minister Rudd’s words.  

 We’ve had Julia Gillard talking today about the possibility of parents having to administer NAPLAN tests. It  seems to me that the Deputy Prime Minister has completely lost control of her portfolio if she’s talking  about tests not being administered by professional people.

 Finally we’ve had the Government’s latest announcement on public hospitals. I’m all in favour of doing  what reasonably can be done to improve the performance of public hospitals, but you can’t just keep  throwing money at problems and it seems that Prime Minister Rudd is throwing money at problems in a  transparent attempt to bribe the state governments to sign up to his plan. Now, if it’s a good plan, the states  should not need to be bribed to sign up and the difficulty with just throwing money at emergency  departments is that unless you’ve got more beds, the emergency departments will remain clogged and  waiting times will remain too long and this seems to be typical of a Government which doesn’t really have a  coherent, well thought through plan - it’s just effectively governing by press release.  

 So, I might ask Steve Ciobo to say a few words about today’s briefing.  

 STEVEN CIOBO:  

 Thanks Tony. Can I just say it’s been good today to have the chance to talk to local tourism operators. This  is a region of Australia where one in every two people is employed in the tourism industry. The tourism  industry is doing it very tough under the Rudd Labor Government. We’ve had a record number of new taxes  imposed on the industry and this Government seems to specialise in sending more Australians abroad for  tourism and getting record numbers of boat people into the country - it all seems a bit perverse. So, it’s been  interesting today to learn about the challenges that local tourism operators have. It’s been instrumental as  part of our framework for what we’ll have as part of our tourism policy going forward, and to find out  [inaudible] ways that government policy and how to make sure that this $24 billion tourism export industry,  and of course with tens of billions of dollars of domestic tourism, can continue to grow. The one other key  point I’d stress is that for alpine regions, we’ve got a great opportunity to get more Australians to holiday in  alpine regions in Australia rather than travel abroad to competitive destinations like, for example, New  Zealand. What it takes is some vision, a policy and a little bit of investment by government and we will be  able to deliver a big windfall for local operators like this.  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Ok, any questions? 

 QUESTION: 

 Mr Abbott, on asylum seekers, would you agree that Sri Lanka and particularly Afghanistan are now safe  enough for people to be sent back or if you were in the position that Kevin Rudd is in at the moment, would  you do what he’s done? 

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 I think the problem is that the changes that the Government made almost two years ago have given the  people smugglers a product to sell and that’s the problem. It’s not so much what’s happening in the region,  it’s the fact that the Government has added to the pull factors by effectively dismantling the border  protection policies of the former government. On Friday they belatedly and tacitly admitted that they’d got it  wrong two years ago. Now they’re trying to say you won’t be processed for three months or for six months  but let’s face it, people were waiting months in Christmas Island anyway and I’m not sure that Friday’s  announcement is going to work. Certainly, the people smugglers, I think, will remain in business because  they suspect as I do that this is an election fix, it’s not a solution.

 QUESTION: 

 You’ve just mentioned election fixes, it could be that you’d be the next Prime Minister, possibly, and it  could be that this six month period that the Afghans have got to wait would still be in situ. Would you  change that? Would you keep it? Would you do something else? 

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Well, plainly, what we would introduce, as the Howard Government had and as my predecessor promised, is  some form of temporary protection visa. Now, people who come by boat, if found to be refugees, would be  on temporary protection visas and there would be at least some prospect of sending those people back to  their homeland when those visas expired, provided conditions in their homeland were satisfactory.  

 QUESTION: 

 On the health offer of Kevin Rudd, yesterday I believe or today: as I understand, it relies upon the states  actually agreeing to his total health reform package. What’s your view of that? Is that a bribe or a blackmail? 

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Well, one way or another, he is holding out financial inducements to get the states to sign up to a plan that  they would not otherwise sign up to and if it was a good plan, they should not need to be bribed into it. It’s  only because it’s not a well thought through plan - as Premier Brumby amongst others has made abundantly  clear - that he’s having to offer this extra inducement. Now, you can’t just endlessly throw money at these  problems and if you are going to invest more money in these problems, you’ve got to at least look like  you’ve thought it through, and putting more money into emergency departments without ensuring that there  are beds in the hospitals for people to go into so that the emergency departments can empty doesn’t look like  it’s a well thought through plan.  

 QUESTION: 

 Are you concerned that the Government might release the Henry Tax Review while you’re in the saddle? 

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Well if they do, I will leave the saddle and go to wherever I need to be to comment appropriately on it.  Certainly, Kevin Rudd has been out of Canberra for the last few days and I think he expects to continue to  be out of Canberra. I commend the Prime Minister on the fact that he too is out attempting to listen to  people. I suspect that Kevin Rudd’s opportunities to meet the people are a little bit more choreographed than  the ones I’ve had in caravan parks and pubs over the last few days.  

 QUESTION:  

 Talking about being in the saddle, was that the toughest ride you’ve ever done this morning? 

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Yes. It was the longest, it was the steepest and it was the highest ride that I’ve ever had. I know it’s a ride  that lots of serious cyclists do. I’m only a recreational cyclist, I’m not a serious competitive cyclist and it  was nice to at least experience on this occasion what they’ve been through. It was a tough ride.  

 QUESTION:  

 Did the wildbrumby schnapps save you from hypothermia when you got back?

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Well the wildbrumby schnapps is a good example of creative and innovative Australian industry. I mean,  this is a boutique distillery here in Thredbo and I would say that certainly in this context it was the best  tasting schnapps I’ve ever had and I congratulate them on producing a world-class product.  

 Thank you.
