 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 07 October 2001  MEDIA RELEASE                          01/596

 Democrats: Government’s refugee policies put innocent lives at risk The Australian Democrats are outraged at the Immigration Minister’s suggestions that the asylum seekers, who were reportedly intercepted last night in Australian waters, hurled themselves and their children overboard as some sort of publicity stunt.

 Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Australian Democrats’ spokesperson for Immigration, said “It would appear that Minister Ruddock, the master of propaganda and misinformation, has outdone himself with his reported declarations that the desperate actions of these latest asylum seekers were planned, premeditated and nothing more than media manipulation.

 “The untruths and distortions purported by the Howard Government are coming unstuck, as boatload after boatload of genuinely desperate and despairing people seek sanctuary in Australia,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “The Government’s harsh treatment of asylum seekers is not working - they’re still coming and they’ll continue to keep coming…boatload after boatload. How much money is the Howard Government prepared to spend trying to deny their international responsibilities to asylum seekers?

 “One hundred million dollars…two hundred million dollars?

 “And when will the Australian Navy resume its proper function as a part of Australia’s defence force rather than pushing overcrowded and unseaworthy civilian vessels back out to sea?”

 “The people who come to Australia in these vessels are desperate and despairing - they have sold-up everything, and they will risk everything, even themselves and their children, particularly if it means that one or more of their family might be safe and free in another country.

 “The Howard Government must abandon its Pauline Hanson-style policies - they don’t work, they won’t work. More boatloads are coming, and still the Howard Government offers no real solutions, no real leadership,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “The Democrats will soon be releasing a comprehensive and workable policy on Australia’s response to asylum seekers, which would see Australia pursuing economically sound strategies while maintaining our commitment to the United Nations Refugee and Human Rights Conventions,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
