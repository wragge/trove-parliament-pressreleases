 Snapshot of Youth 2002   

 As one of my first significant duties as Labor’s Shadow Minister for Children  and Youth it gives me great pleasure to present this Report, Snapshot of  Youth 2002, to Simon Crean, the Leader of the Opposition.   

 This Report is the compilation of the results from Labor’s Youth Survey and  the “hands on” work experience and consultations held throughout Youth  week.  The result is a substantial report on the views and thoughts of young  people in Australia.    

 The Report aims to provide Simon Crean, as our Leader, with a snapshot of  the issues, concerns and ideas of young people in 2002.     

 I hope that by providing this information early in our policy review process it  will ensure that the voices of young people are heard, and their ideas  considered as we re-think Labor’s strategies for the coming years.   

 Included in this Report is:   â¢ Labor’s Youth survey results - key interests, worries and  suggestions  â¢ “Voices” of young people through extensive direct quotes  â¢ Feedback from National Youth Week activities  â¢ Feedback from broader consultations with young people  â¢ Areas identified for further policy development work 

 

 I hope this Report is constructive in ensuring young people’s views are heard  by Labor, and by the broader community.  The Report, however, is not an end  in itself.  It helps identify some issues Labor can work on further.  I believe it  will help us develop policies that will be good for young people and provide  some grounding for much more work and consultation with many more young  people, groups, advocacy bodies and experts.       

 The coordination of this project from early this year has been no small task  and my thanks go to all my staff, and Matt Nurse in particular.  The project,  however, could not have succeeded without the work done by many Labor  caucus members across the country over the last few months.  My thanks go  to them all for ensuring this Report is one of breadth and substance (they are  all acknowledged on the front cover of this Report and throughout the text).   

 Above all, thanks to the thousands of young people who filled in the survey,  attended our forums, bought groceries from us, and had a say in the future of  their country.  We need you and your opinions to ensure Governments deliver  the best outcomes and support for young people into the future.

 “It is impossible to narrow down all the concerns of today’s young persons to  3 items, but its welcoming to see an opportunity to voice such concerns.     

 Most young people feel totally alienated from the political process let alone  understand how it actually works - hell I’ve talked to a 35 year old  who  thought globalisation had something to do with basketball (maybe it does?).    

 The point is a lot of us have given up, given up on growing up - because once  we’re old enough to do your job the mess will be so bad, so irreversibly  damaged we might as well take drugs or jump off bridges or shoot our  teachers.   

 All I want is to breathe clean air when I ride my bike to work, instead of  choking on car fumes.    

 I want to eat food free of pesticides and chemicals.     

 I want the police to protect me instead of harassing me and searching me as I  walk down the street.     

 I want to work and earn enough money so its not worth being on the dole.     

 I want a workplace free of slaps to the arse.     

 And one day, when I have a husband, and have children, I hope the damage  is less, so I can teach them to live responsibly.”

 “Some concerns of mine include that of society in general.  The stereotypical  synopsis of teenagers is that we all smoke drugs, go to parties and get  “pissed”, drive fast and noisy cars, try to obtain hand outs from the  government for as long as feasible and expect nothing in return, and that we  have no respect for anyone or anything.    

  In reality the majority of us are nothing like that.  For instance, I have had my  probationary licence for 2 years, and still have a “clean” license, I don’t drink  very often and I would go out of my way to help another individual in need.  All  I ask in this regard is that you treat us with the same dignity and respect that  you would a fellow collaborator.”

 Section 1 - Labor’s Youth Survey 

 Background   

 a. Methodology   

 A survey of young people was conducted by the following group of Labor MPs  and Senators from across the country:      

 NSW  Anthony Albanese MP (Grayndler), Julia Irwin MP (Fowler),   Stephen Martin MP (Cunningham)    

 QLD Senator John Hogg, Con Sciacca MP (Bowman)   

 TAS Sid Sidebottom MP (Braddon)   

 VIC  Ann Corcoran MP (Isaacs), Nicola Roxon MP (Gellibrand),   Kelvin Thomson MP (Wills), Maria Vamvakinou MP (Calwell)   

 WA Sharyn Jackson MP (Hasluck), Kim Wilkie MP (Swan)   

 The surveys were distributed using various methods - direct mail to young  people, web site forums, sessions through schools, clubs, councils and a  huge range of other youth based organisations.   

 You will note from the survey’s format that the questions are open ended.  They are not necessarily politically focussed. The aim was to find out what  young people care about, are interested in and worry about.  It was also  optional for people to inc lude their names, addresses and ages, in order to  provide young people with any anonymity they may have required.     

 

 b. Respondents   

 At the time of the publication of this report 2105 responses had been received  from young people across the country.  Please note that late survey  responses are still being received and are not included in this report.     

 People from as young as 5 to the age of 25 participated in the survey.  The  age group with the highest proportion of respondents were 10 -18 year olds.   It is often more difficult to provide information to young people once they leave  school, which may have had an impact on these age groups.  This is also a  factor that needs to be taken into consideration as Labor develops policies for  the future.   

 Slightly more young women returned the survey than young men at 1106  women compared to 999 men.

 We had respondents from as far and wide as Eastern Perth, regional  Tasmania, inner city Melbourne, and Central Queensland, Inner Western  Melbourne, Inner Northern Melbourne, North western Melbourne, Outer South  Eastern Melbourne, Inner City Brisbane, Regional South Eastern Queensland,  Central Queensland, Western Sydney, Inner Sydney, Eastern Brisbane,  Regional Tasmania, Eastern Perth, Wollongong and surrounds.

 Survey Results 

 

 Main issues in the survey responses   

 

 i. “What are the three things you enjoy doing most?”   

 Overwhelmingly young people identified sport as something they enjoy.  Over  60% of respondents listed sport, plus street sport specifically, as one of their  main three interests.     

 Socialising was second (48%), with music and dancing somewhat behind  (28%).     

 All the other range of interests rated significantly lower than these standout  responses, but still rank highly (from 15% to 5%).  These were computers,  shopping, watching television and movies and families and cooking.   

 The table below sets out the range of issues young people identified as most  enjoyable.  We have included all issues where over 100 people identified it in  their responses - thus ensuring that at least 5% raised this as an item.   

 Favourite pastimes often mentioned (but still only by around 1-3% of  respondents) were: cars, sleeping, animals, traveling, camping  and holidays.

 From the questions to young people about what they enjoy and are interested  in we have quite a clear result across age groups of major interests and  activities capturing the imagination of these young people - sport, socialising,  relaxing.     

 These are past times and interests that clearly don’t show up in more  politically directed surveys.   When we look at the results of the third question  (what worries young people the most) we see a much broader response  across a wider range of issues.   

 It appears we can generalise about young people’s interests much more  across ages and location when it comes to relaxation and enjoyment - but that  the range of pressures, worries and fears are much more varied.

 iii “What are the three things that worry you the most?”   

 School, school work and results rated as the biggest worry for young people.    You will note that even the highest ranking issues in answer to this question is  only 29% of respondents (nowhere near the 60% for sport for the first  question).  Note also that the high number of responses from school aged  children will have significantly affected this result.    

 Families and parents rank next, followed closely by crime and safety, worries  about the future, unemployment, death, money, drugs, war.  Friends, health  and the environment were also significant worries.     

 All the above issues (shown in the table below) rated with more than 5% of  respondents.

 Because of the diverse range of answers on what worries young people most  it is also important to note the smaller, but still significant groups worrying  about other issues.  The second table below includes issues raised by (1-5%)  respondents.     

 You will note that these issues such as roads and road accidents are  repeated in the answers to what young people would do if they were Prime  Minister for the Day.  Answers include bullying, terrorism and dangerous  creatures such as snakes and spiders (predominantly in the younger age  groups) amongst others such as suicide, poverty and asylum seekers.

 iv. “If you were Prime Minister for a day, what would you do?”   

 

 It is in answer to this question that we had the broadest range of suggestions -  some detailed, others brief, some downright cheeky, but all food for thought.     

 It was virtually impossible (as you will see from the nature of the quotes we  have included in the following pages) to tabulate these results.   

 However, there were five issues commonly repeated amongst many of  the responses:  1 remove the GST  2 fix poverty 

 3 increase (or reduce) the number of refugees  4 improve the environment  5 increase education spending     

 To understand the significance of these issues, readers should be aware that  182 responses (nearly 9%) said if they were Prime Minister for the day, they  would abolish the GST.  This may be a surprising result to some, but in other  consultations they point to low wages (or no income) and many of their  activities being taxed  - transport, movies, take away food, sport and books.   Young people feel under financial pressure due to the GST.   

 162 young people would fix poverty (7.6%) - and readers will see from the  quotes the very strong sense of fairness and justice that these people want for  our country.    

 147 respondents indicated an interest in the level of refugee intake into  Australia.  Of these, 94 respondents would increase the number of refugees,  with just over half that (53) who would reduce or expel the refugees.  Clearly  this issue is a topical one but the views are mixed.    

 Just under 5% of responses included a desire to improve the environment and  around the same number to increase education spending. 

 A Snapshot of Youth  Labor’s report to Simon Crean 12 April 2002 

  13 

 

 After the top 5 issues, those mentioned next most regularly included  creating employment, helping the homeless and world peace.   

 Also raised often when asked what they would do if they were Prime Minister  for a day, were:  â¢ consult with the Australian people before doing anything,   â¢ building youth facilities,  

 â¢ increasing welfare,   â¢ getting tough on drugs,   â¢ seek racial equality and   â¢ apologise to the stolen generation.   

 Smaller, but still commonly raised issues were:   â¢ reduce taxes  â¢ reduce refugees  â¢ create skateparks  â¢ ban smoking  â¢ greater war commitment  â¢ reduce MPs entitlements  â¢ increase international aid  â¢ create a republic  â¢ lower the drinking age  â¢ legalise marijuana  â¢ increase animal protection

 Survey Reports from participating MPs 

 

 Sharryn Jackson MP, Federal Labor Member for Hasluck:   

 “The most striking response from the youths surveyed in the Hasluck  Electorate is their growing awareness and concern surrounding the escalation  of war and conflict in the world during the past year.     

 Their apprehension about this situation is reflected in responses to the 'top  three things that worry you the most', where responses such as: 'too much  war', 'nuclear war', 'innocent people getting killed', 'end of the world', and  'flying in planes' were commonplace.     

 Domestically youth have just as many concerns to contend with.  A high  proportion of respondents stated that securing employment and the cost of  going to University were amongst their top concerns .     

 However, despite the very real international and domestic challenges facing  youth today, I am immensely encouraged when I see the passion,  commitment and ingenuity of our youth, in devising solutions to overcome  these problems."   

 Sid Sidebottom, Federal Labor Member for Braddon:   

 “I was pleased that a lot of our responses said they liked where they lived,  wanted more activities and facilities specifically for young people (not an  uncommon response I suspect!) but I was saddened to read so many have  such a low opinion of politics and politicians. Is  this reinforced by adults or by  their direct experience? I suspect many have never really met a politician as  opposed to seeing one (up the front, with the adults, in a suit or formally  dressed) and maybe we should set out to implement an Adopt-a-Pollie  strategy.”   

 Stephen Martin, Federal Labor Member for Cunningham and Shadow  Minister for Trade and Tourism:   

 "We all live in a rapidly changing world, but no group feels the pressure more  than our youth. The responses I've had from young people in Cunningham are  very enthusiastic, intelligent and encouraging. Young people are often  portrayed in stereotypes by the media and sections of the community.  It's  incredibly unfair. My survey responses show young people dedicated to  education, a fair-go, and optimistic about Australia's future".

 Kelvin Thomson, Federal Member for Wills and Shadow Minister for the  Environment and Heritage:   

 “As one might expect, sport, family and TV play a big role in the lives of our  young people. The things that interest them are enormously varied, as are the  things they worry about. While some of their worries seem a little fanciful, like  fear of sharks and snakes, the 10 year old girl who wrote that she worried  about ‘her house burning down again’ did seem to have a point.   

 The answers to the question ‘what would you do if you were Prime Minister for  a day’, were overwhelmingly charitable and about helping others.   

 The most frequent response was ‘I would help the poor’, or ‘I would give more  food to the poor people’. Other common responses were ‘get rid of the GST,  allow the refugees to stay in Australia’, and improve the environment. Several  mentioned drugs and proposed harsher measures to deal with the problem.   

 One young man seemed in little doubt of the capacities of Prime Ministers,  saying if he were PM he would invent cars that fly.   

 Some parents may be relieved to know that not all the answers were quite so  earnest or selfless. One 15 year old Pascoe Vale girl said her main interest  was boys, one 11 year old boy said his main worry was his sister, and one  boy declared that if he were Prime Minister for a day he would take a  limousine to Luna Park, return to his big comfy home, sit down in his big  comfy chair, and sack all the staff.   

 Much as I wish for the young people of Wills that all their dreams come true, it  might be better for all concerned if his particular aspiration remains  unrealised.”   

 Ann Corcoran, Federal Labor Member for Isaacs:   

 “Almost everyone said that their interests and what they enjoy the most are  music, sport and spending time with their family and friends.   

 The things they are worried about include their studies, personal safety  (bullying, crime), terrorism, the environment and phone bills!!   

 The things they'd do if PM for a day, in no particular order, are: create things  for young people to do, do something about the environment, asylum seekers,  the homeless, drugs, GST, bullying, republic, logging.     

 In short, the issues that are of concern to young people are the same issues  that are of concern to older people/the population at large.   

 I was impressed with thoughtfulness displayed by those completing the  surveys.”

 Con Sciacca, Federal Labor Member for Bowman    

 “Young people often feel that they are overlooked in the political process - that  their opinions are not worth knowing and their votes are not worth courting.  I  was pleased that so many young people in my electorate of Bowman took the  time to respond to the Youth Survey, giving me an opportunity to see the very  real concerns they have for the future of our community and their suggestions  for new policy directions particularly in the areas of employment, education  and training.

 Section 2 - Voices of Young People 

  ‘What if I was Prime Minister for a Day?’   

 In order to do justice to many of the young people that responded to the Youth  Survey, their ideas, ambitions and comments about what they would do if they  had Australia’s top job for a day are included below.   

 They are roughly grouped into broad categories.   

 1. Social justice, sense of fairness, helping the poor   

 Make Australia a free country, where all people are treated equally, including  the heads of Australian society.  Male, 17, Mentone, Vic   

 The first thing I would do if I were Prime Minister would be to give money to  the poor, homeless and lonely people.  Also I would ask if I could make some  more bike tracks.  Carla, 11, Pascoe Vale, Vic 

 

 Buy a building for all the poor people to live in, clothes to get dressed in and  food to eat.  Male, 11, Craigieburn, Vic   

 I would donate  money to families that may have a sick or disabled child.  I  would also give money to the poor.  Angeleen, 10, Pasco Vale, Vic   

 I would give money to the schools in Australia to help buy equipment for  teaching and also so they have lots of things to help teach children.  I would  also give money to charity and to the people that have no food, dirty water to  drink and to help put up buildings and doctor’s surgeries and much more. 

 Female, 10, Reservoir, Vic 

 

 Try and make peace with other countries, stop racism.  Stop the war in  Afghanistan.  Stop Sexism.  Use the newest technology to look through all the  jails and test everyone and retrieval people to see if people are innocent.  Female, 11, Coburg, Vic 

 

 I would let the refugees into Australia.  Change the way women are treated.   Help people with drug addictions.  Female, 11, Strathmore, Vic   

 Raise money for the poor people and homeless people so they can have a  home and food, so they can live like everyone else, and have a free, happy  and safe life.  I also would  take off the GST and make costs smaller.  Female, 11, Pascoe Vale, Vic 

 A Snapshot of Youth  Labor’s report to Simon Crean 12 April 2002 

  18 

 

 Find homes for all the homeless.  Rebecca, 15, MaidaVale, WA 

 

 Help charities as much as possible. 

 Matt, 15, Wynyard, Tas 

 

 Give money to help our homeless and disadvantaged people and families.  Emily, 20, Devonport, Tas 

 

 I would give a substantial amount of money to the Housing Commission to  build more homes for younger people.  Anna, 16, Devonport, Tas   

 Listen to the public and help them 

 Elliot, 13, Corrimal, NSW 

 

 Try to come up with ideas to help the refugees as they are not getting benefits  as they should from the human rights such as education etc.  Female, 17, Kananooka, NSW   

 Make people aware of issues that affect the youth of Australia, like suicide,  drug and alcohol abuse etc.  Brooke, 17, Bulli, NSW   

 I would nationalise every public service in Australia, eg schools, public  transport, hospitals and other services which should be free to everyone and  hence create better equality.  Alex, 15, Corrimal, NSW 

 

 I would try to make peace in the world and meet other famous people.  Christopher, 13, North Sunshine, Vic 

 

 I would let the asylum seekers in 

 Male, 18, Maribyrnong Vic 

 

 I would tell the Government to stop giving heroin addicts drugs, which they  think are helping them.  And give them to people who need drugs.  Diabetics  need insulin, which is a must, its not like heroin addicts NEED heroin.   

 Diabetics pay for the insulin and if they don’t have it they could die! Insulin is  extremely expensive and it annoys me that it’s a disease, not something they  want!  Thank you and please help!  Yvonne, 16, Laverton Vic 

 

 I would give everyone a fair shot for their dreams.  I would try to stop racism  and bring the world together.  Female, 15, Roleystone WA 

 A Snapshot of Youth  Labor’s report to Simon Crean 12 April 2002 

  19 

 

 I would put more money into hospitals.  Female, 15, Maddington WA 

 

 There’s not a lot of dramatic changes that can be achieved in a day, but I’d  use the time to talk to politicians and masses. Generally any methods  possible to communicate with society and hopefully enlighten them on the  possibilities of the  future to motivate people to take some initiative and act in  society’s best interests. 

 Melissa, 17, Thornlie, WA 

 

 Redirect Government funding to services that help people and not hinder  youth groups and housing and stuff.  Female, 24, Dulwich Hill, NSW   

 

 “I would help all the poor people and make better schools and hospitals.”  Moshtaq, 19, Flemington Vic 

 

 “Charge the rich people more tax to help out the poor.  Apologise to the  Aboriginals.”  Male, 22, Hoppers Crossing Vic   

 “I would help Australia’s young people who are poor and also help other kids  in other countries.  Donate something for their future.”  Female, 14, Petersham, NSW   

 “I will build a swimming pool and fun place near my house, put the GST down,  make people happy and donate money to the poor.  I will help the Aboriginals  and give them food and give some money to the homeless.”  Anthony, 11, Marrickville, NSW 

 

 

 

 2. Jobs, living standards, cost of living   

 Give everyone a job and a home with some soap.  Male,16, Seaford, Vic 

 

 Raise pay for all teachers and Nurses, pay off the national debt, invest in  sustainable sources of energy (efficient, solar, hydro etc), and encourage  Australians to create import replacements. - all at once!!  Thomas, 17, Beaumaris, Vic  

 

 I would take away the GST and make everything cheaper than it is now  because some poor families right now may not be able to buy some groceries  because they might not be paid enough.  Alex, 11 Pascoe Vale South, Vic 

 

 No more GST, more money for schools

 Male, 10 Pascoe Vale South, Vic 

 

 I would stop pollution.  I would stop drink driving  Female, 11, Keilor, Vic 

 

 If I were Prime Minister for a day I would lower the GST tax and Help Ansett.  Michael, 10, Pascoe Vale, Vic 

 

 Rearrange the Federal Budget to focus on business rather that a conveniently  located slab of road which only makes maintaining roads harder.  Male, 15, South Perth, WA   

 Implement more policies which focus on health and fitness of Australian  People.  Female, 16, Bentley WA   

 Improve the employment situation especially in Tasmania.  Also give kids a  better chance to get the jobs they want eg doctor, teacher, they’re difficult  because of the employment situation.  Stephanie, 15, Somerset, Tas 

 

 Allow students whose parents earn ‘over a certain amount’ to receive youth  allowance and living away from home allowance.  Leah, 17, Burnie, Tas   

 Bring in a kind of allowance for young people who move out of home but do  earn an income, especially a low income of course.  Female, 20, Wynnum, QLD   

 I would abolish/seriously review the current Austudy allowance, personally I  think it stinks, so many abuse the system.  Female, 18, Birkdale, QLD   

 Abolish mandatory detention sentencing for asylum seekers, ratify the Kyoto  Protocol, abolish work for the dole or make the work/training in an employable  field for that person.  Stop the prohibitionist approach to drugs and implement  real life experience.  Youth Education program to prevent drug use. 

 Peter, 24, Birkdale, QLD 

 

 Look at the price of living in today’s world.  All we do is work and pay bills.  I’d  hate to have kids as well.  We would do nothing - we don’t get out much as it  is.  Amanda, 25, Birkdale, QLD 

 

 Restructure Youth A llowance so there would not be so many loopholes for  rich families to ‘make an extra buck’ while honest hard working people, who  are just over the limit (but still don’t have much money) have to live in poverty  to make their way through university.  I would also increase funding for  universities and scrap the current system of university place selection (the Op

 method) as it tends to rank students on the performance of their school rather  than their own academic merit.  Jessica, 18, Wynnum   

 If I were Prime Minister for a day, I would speak with the Hon. Matt  Foley(Minister for Employment Training, Youth and Minister for the Arts) and  Ken Smith (DG) and  develop strategies to lower the cost of undertaking  training (TAFE or RTO) to further my career.  Also I would speak to someone  with regards to the low income youth receive… where as youth are earning  anything from $5 - $8/hr.  We pay the same bills, most of us are on a low  income rate, live out of home and are often struggling to keep up.  Do you  think you could change this and get our knowledge/ experience/ skills  recognised??? 

 Elisha 19, Birkdale, QLD 

 

 Have more permanent positions for young people and do away with casual  positions as they lead you nowhere (and sack the present party)  Jace, 23, Wynnum West, QLD   

 Take off the GST 

 Male, 15, Maidstone, Vic 

 

 Put down the price on pads and tampons! Because women have to buy them  all the time.  And if they’re expensive, women wont buy them no more.  Female, 14, Sunshine Vic   

 I would eliminate the GST as it may be getting too hard for working class  people to buy things and things like milk have gone up when they shouldn’t  have.  Female, 15, St Albans Vic 

 

 Lower ta xes, build some useful things, not like a bell tower.  Male, 16, Canning Vale, WA 

 

 Reduce poverty in Australia and give everyone a job that pays.  Tamara, 16, Canning Vale, WA 

 

 Spend a lot of money fixing up our health system, especially public health and  giving money to suicide prevention that has already been set up.  Natalie, 19, Coopers Plains QLD   

 Try to manufacture more goods in Australia to export and using what we  produce to maintain ourselves.  Ana, 22, Moorooka QLD   

 GST! - remove it, it’s the worst thing for living and surviving.  Improve the  environment, education, health status, 4 working days & 3 day weekend!,  more consideration and assistance for schools, child care centres, out of  hours school care etc. 

 Christina 22 and Zafir 20, Annerley, QLD

 My main concern is unemployment.  We as the youth have to go through 12  years of education in order to accomplish nothing and what I mean by that is,  we leave school with no qualifications and no idea what the real world is like  and then are expected to find  employment.  I am 19 years of age and I can  not attend TAFE to further my education as junior wages barely cover general  living expenses. Centrelink refuses to acknowledge that I am no longer  dependent on my parents and that even if I were dependent on my parents, I  would be unable to claim benefits as I do not “qualify”.  I have goals and  ambitions which I would like to follow though but I can not execute these  dreams due to lack of qualifications and capital. 

 Tanya, age unknown, Coopers Plains, QLD 

 

 No mandatory sentencing 

 Male, 17, Enfield NSW 

 

 I would do something about the 3 things that worry me most (teen suicide,  youth unemployment, places littered with syringes).  Female, 19, Boyne Island QLD   

 Make all doctors bulk bill Medicare and add dentistry to Medicare.  I have  worked in a number of employment/training agencies and believe there is a  great need for assistance with computer and internet access, resume  assistance and free training in basic computer skills for unemployed people.   Although Job Netwo rk/Centrelink are meant to provide this, they either do not  or turn people away because there are not enough resources to go around. 

 Female, 23, Gladstone QLD 

 

 Raise the amount of money single parents receive from the Government and  have more information about having and raising a baby and sex education in  school.  Trish, 19, Bundaberg QLD 

 

 Try to encourage business and large companies to employ school leavers  even if on a job share basis with other staff.  There are too many unemployed  people around which causes problems in the community.  Emma, 21, Gladstone, QLD 

 

 I would have another look at the selection criteria for Youth Allowance.  Lauren, 20, Bundaberg West, QLD 

 

 “I would raise taxes so that University could be free and everyone could have  a good education.”  Female, 10, Canterbury, NSW 

 A Snapshot of Youth  Labor’s report to Simon Crean 12 April 2002 

  23 

 

 “Try to find a way to put more functions into important areas such as  healthcare, medical research, the environment, those in need and so on,  while trying not to put an extra burden on the average Australian.  To be  truthful, I don’t know how I would go about doing it.  I know I would try though  and that is all anyone can possibly expect; that our head of state would do  their best to support the interests of the community.” 

 Justine, 17, Marrickville NSW 

 

 “I would roll back the GST because I think it is unfair for teenagers because  most of us have no income and have to pay more for goods and services and  get no benefits from it.”  Renee, 15, West Sunshine, Vic 

 

 “Create jobs for every unemployed person and remove the GST.”  Tanya, 20, Bundaberg QLD 

 

 “Make Youth Allowance not taxable - it hurts the poor like me.  The GST hurts  enough with out this, thank you.”  Sally, 20, Coopers Plains QLD   

 

 3. Cynicism / Political Engagement   

 Quit 

 Male, 15, Parkdale, Vic 

 

 I doubt that I would want to be Prime Minister at this time due to the corruption  and lies in politics now.  Male, WA   

 Try to look a bit friendlier than your normal PM.  John Howard looks creepy.   I’d try to dress a bit more stylishly.  Female, 15, Tas   

 I would build more skate parks and bike jumps and since I’ve taken John  Howard’s job I would send him to Afghanistan and he would not be allowed to  enter the country.  Male, 11, Broadmeadows, Vic 

 

 If I were Prime Minister for a day I would declare a holiday throughout  Australia.  It would be the best holiday ever.  There would be parades  competitions, prizes, music, food and lots more fun stuff.  Every one could  come from babies to homeless people, from old people to pets! 

 Tim, 10, Male, Pascoe Vale, Vic 

 

 I would go to Afghanistan and give Easter eggs to all the kids so they could  have a good Easter.  Female, 14, Montagu, Tas   

 A Snapshot of Youth  Labor’s report to Simon Crean 12 April 2002 

  24 

 Make Sid (Sidebottom) Deputy 

 Male, 16, Ulverstone, Tas 

 

 Thank the people of the Nation for Voting for me...and I am going to be Prime  Minister one day  (well I hope so!)  Female, 17, Burnie, Tas   

 Talk to the Governor General and tell George W. Bush Australia is not the  53rd State of the US!  Male, 17, Burnie, Tas   

 Call up another Referendum on Australia becoming a Republic.  Male, 18, Alexandra Hills, QLD 

 

 Make sure the local pollies follow up and act on responses to surveys such as  this.  I would also allocate funding for heaps of legal street art sites.  Christian, 23, Birkdale, QLD   

 Remove my shirt, tie, and suit then visit 3 unlikely/ unfamiliar territories of  those who are of an unfamiliar socio-economic level (within my own town/city)  Male, 23. Wynnum West, QLD   

 Get rid of the tax on Tampons and pads.  If having a period was optional (thus  incurring the tax) I sure as hell wouldn’t be having them!  Female, 19, Capalaba, QLD   

 Establish a forum for youths to voice their opinions and concerns.  We often  are ignored and need a political outlet to express the issues we feel are  important.  Jayne, 18, Raby Bay, QLD 

 

 Enforce a policy that Parliament Members are to directly answer the questions  asked during Question Time.  In recent months it appears that members  regularly use up question time by going off on unrelated tangents, by refusing  to answer, or just insulting the other party.  Perhaps enforcement of this policy  would allow more work to be done.  It would also mean that our leaders would  be setting a better example for our youth. 

 Female, 18, Wellington Point, QLD 

 

 I like that you bothered to find out what we (younger people) want to  have/hear because that’s often what we wonder about the Government when  it comes to election time- what is in it for us?  Nadine, 20, Manly, QLD 

 

 Get a better job.  The Prime Minister is up himself.  Put more money into the  scouting association.  Morgan, 13, Seaholme Vic   

 I would think “what the hell am I doing being a Prime Minister”  Female, 14, Braybrook, Vic 

 A Snapshot of Youth  Labor’s report to Simon Crean 12 April 2002 

  25 

 

 Not sure.  I’ll never be in that position.  Male, 16, Thornlie, WA 

 

 I don’t wanna be Prime Minister.  Male, 18, Hurlstone Park NSW 

 

 Say sorry to the Aboriginal population  Male, 17, Croydon, NSW 

 

 I would sack Hollingworth and make sure children come first before anything -  and spend more money on roads.  Female, 19, Bundaberg QLD   

 Take advantage of all of the extras (maybe even go on a holiday somewhere).  Female, 21, Gladstone QLD 

 

 

 

 4. Things to do, activities, sport, socialising   

 I would make more things to do for younger people, as I think there is not a lot  of things in Vic.  Female, 15, Dingley, Vic   

 Set up a Dramatics Arts foundation on the North West coast of Tasmania.  Tarryn, 15, Somerset, Tas 

 

 Give Kingsville Tennis Club a grant for more courts.  Female, 13, Seddon. Vic 

 

 Build a skate park on the beachfront in Williamstown.  Male, 12, Williamstown Vic 

 I would give money to the Illawarra soccer premier league and help to get rid  of drugs.  James, 16, Keiraville, NSW   

 Sell the Olympic Stadium (worth $30 million) and house all the homeless  people.  Also increase Centrelink benefits and get rid of heroin injecting  rooms.    

 I think it should be actual young people speaking their voices in Parliament,  not politicians.  The fact that you are seeking your electorate’s youth’s views  is a step in the right direction as far as I am concerned.   

 Also, there is nothing for young people in the Illawarra to do at a low cost, or  this seems to be the view o f most.  What teenager has $80 to see Silverchair  for example?  The youth centre is a good idea but hasn’t got things on that  most teenagers enjoy.  The circus?  Boring!   

 A Snapshot of Youth  Labor’s report to Simon Crean 12 April 2002 

  26 

 Also, most see it as a place for drugos and losers and I wouldn’t be seen  dead there.  We need stuff to do to keep kids off the streets and away from  drugs and crime.  Kellie, 17, Coniston, NSW 

 

 

 5. Education, futures, environment   

 Cut Down logging in forests and try to make Australia a better place to live in.  Female, 16, Mordialloc, Vic 

 

 Cut down the amount of trees getting cut.  Make a place for druggies to make  a new start in life so they can get over drugs.  I would do something about  people who want to commit suicide, tell them they shouldn’t do it.  I would also  change the hours of school. 

 Female, 16, Seaford, Vic 

 

 I would go to all the different countries in the world and attempt to make  peace with them.  Female, 15, Wilson WA   

 Assess employment issues, hold a youth suicide awareness program and  assess the big issues of suicide.  Also throw a party for the youth of Australia.  Alyce, 15, Ulverstone, Tas   

 The first thing I would do would be to assess the viability of gradually  replacing traditional energy sources (ie fossil fuels) with alternative, renewable  sources of energy.   

 Belinda, 24, Thorneside, QLD 

 I would increase the amount of pay for nurses and nursing students should  get some money or benefits ie uniforms paid for.  As a student, on our  practical assessments at hospitals, we students do as much work as fully  endorsed and registered nurses.  I know that the nursing profession wouldn’t  be the only one with these problems (education for example).   

 Another thing… I would decrease the pay of politicians, no offence, put it  towards over areas that do need money, eg. Nursing.   

 Another thing..  we (uni students) should be able to claim expenses (books  uniforms, stationary) in our taxes.  We are working in our profession, we  should have the right to claim.. Not all of us work in nursing homes, we have  other part time jobs, but when we go o n our practical assessments in  hospitals we are working, working as hard as nurses.  Where are the  benefits? 

 Female, 21, Manly, QLD 

 

 Free breakfast in schools. 

 Male, 17, Ardeer, Vic  

 

 A Snapshot of Youth  Labor’s report to Simon Crean 12 April 2002 

  27 

 I would make it compulsory for every student in Australia who attends high  school to have a lap top computer provided by the school so students could  do their work.  Female, 15, Ardeer, Vic 

 

 I’m not much into politics, so I don’t really follow it.  Yes I do care what  happens, but I’m never one to speak out… so I’ll give it my best shot; I would  make a law for recycling.  Everyone needs to recycle to make this world  cleaner and safer.  Everyone to run their cars on gas - no pollution. 

 Belinda, 17, Huntingdale WA 

 

 I would review the Youth Allowance.  I don’t think the community or the  Government understand how hard it is to go to university, pay for text books,  transport etc on the money you get from Centrelink.  When you are doing a  full on course like myself (occupational therapy), you don’t have the time to  work.  If you do you can only manage a couple of hours.  At the end of the  week you may have about $50 extra after tax.  This for most people is their  transport money.   

 It is especially hard at the beginning of the semester as there is at least 5-7  new textbooks, which mind yo u cost $90+   

 For my course and others such as physiotherapy, dentistry etc, it is  compulsory for us to have injections for TB, polio, Hep A+B etc as we are  health care workers.  We have to pay $70x3 for the Hep A+B injections plus  for a blood test to see if it has been taken.  We get no concession for it  because the Government has stopped bulk billing for it.  Why? We need these  injections plus the blood test before we go out on practicals in hospitals etc,  which we do 2 weeks into semester.  Two weeks notice for this sort of money  is basically impossible so the ones that cant afford it miss out until they can. 

 Hana, 18, Annerley QLD 

 

 Keep Marrickville safe and leave all schools open.  Especially Marrickville  High School.  Sandra, 14, Punchbowl NSW   

 Approach the youth drug problem in regards to rehabilitation  Female 23, Bundaberg QLD 

 

 Concentrate on the Kyoto Protocol in reducing Australia’s gas emissions to a  more acceptable level when compared with our population size.  Female, 19, St Lucia QLD   

 “I would give money to schools that really need it to give them the opportunity  to grow and develop and equal up in education as those snobby posh  schools.  Also develop systems for our troubled youth to help them get back  to ordinary living and not a life of crime.  S how them that there are  alternatives.” 

 Female, 17, Marrickville, NSW

 “Save the environment” 

 Male, 17, Thirroul, NSW   

 “Clean up the streets from layabouts, junkies, graffiti & rubbish.  Emphasise a  clean environment.”  Lauren, 17, West Footscray Vic   

 

 6. Families, support for young people   

 Increase funding to family/community/youth services and attempt to somehow  rectify the massive problem of family dysfunction - counselling, support  networks etc.  Marko, 17, Menton, Vic 

 

 Give counsellors to all schools for a day for free, so children could talk  through their problems without people knowing or having to pay.  Also I would  put on a few concerts with different bands.  Female, 14, Edithvale, Vic 

 Buy a real fast car.  Help Homeless people.  Female, 14 Forest, Tas 

 

 Set up a fairer system that allowed more parents (mother and father) the  opportunity to be at home to raise their children without financial worry.  Female, 24, Alexandra Hills, QLD   

 My son has Down’s syndrome so disability services are a major concern.    Male, 19, Alexandra Hills, QLD 

 

 Set up more drop in centres with free kids entertainment like a pool table,  pinball games, coffee, tea and small snacks, a place to hang out with friends  Charlotte, 23, Cleveland, QLD   

 I’d probably look into organising more activities for young people to do.  Then  maybe there wouldn’t be so many bored teenagers around causing trouble eg  starting fights, road rage etc  Female, 20, Capalaba QLD 

 

 Start an Australian wide band/music program to promote music and help kids  who are discouraged due to lack of emphasis out of school.  Male, 19, Alexandra Hills, QLD   

 I would provide more entertainment and create more industry in rural areas so  they can stay in business and so that country people wouldn’t be forced to  move to the city.  Male, 13, Mt Ousley, NSW

 I would make sure that the police didn’t have the right to be rude to others.  I  think that they think they have the authority to treat us as inferior, dumb and  even like criminals BEFORE they can prove what we have done wrong.   

 Also make some places, or allow areas for people to hang out.  Every place  people spend time with their friends, the police come and kick them out (eg  Southbeach at times).  I would have specific areas that everyone can spend  time at when they want. 

 Female, 16, Unanderra, NSW 

 

 Make public transport free.  It just keeps getting more expensive.  My mum  has to pay so much every week just so we can get to school.  Trudy, 16, Laverton Vic   

 Keep Marrickville High School open.  Female, 16, Marrickville 

 

 Get rid of the GS T.  Have more youth activities to keep youth out of trouble.  Michael, 21, Boyne Island QLD   

 I am a student who has just completed grade 12 last year and have not yet  found a job.  I am however undertaking a Diploma in Children’s Services at  TAFE and am finding it hard to pay the fees.  I strongly feel that ALL students  who are prepared to study should be entitled to receive Youth Allowance, it  should not depend on the parents’ income.   

 I am not entitled to Youth Allowance because my mum and dad are just above  the cut off limit.  It is not just the parents who have to pay for things, it is the  students too.  We have to pay fees, buy food, clothes and the everyday living  essentials.  Just because your parents earn that much, it doesn’t mean that  they can afford to do everything for you.  My parents are struggling now, and  my next TAFE payment is due on 18 March.  I really think it is unfair when I  was at school there was kids only going and mucking up in class just to get  their fortnightly payments.  While others like me worked extremely hard and  we got nothing from the Government. 

 Female, 17, Walkervale-Bundaberg QLD 

 

 I am very interested in helping you to help our community.  And by doing this I  would like to state my feelings on how to help less privileged communities  such as Mount Morgan.   

 You probably know by now what kinds of things are happening in Mount  Morgan.  Such as the lack of water, poor conditions of our roads and the lack  of work and business in our community.  As part of the community this affects  my family and the community itself.  We hope that you will take into  consideration these aspects and help us to resolve these problems.

 7. Safety 

 

 Get security guards on the streets so everyone is safe.  Help poor people.  Make world peace.  Female, 11, Coburg, Vic   

 

 I’d do something about drugs.  I’d try to get rid of them; they’re disgusting.  Rhiannon, 10, Coburg, Vic. 

 

 I would mostly concentrate on road safety.  I would ask all radio stations to not  tell where the speed camera are because that’s causing people to slow down  on that road and speed back up again. It doesn’t really make a different  situation people are still dying with them or not with them. 

 Female, 10, Glenroy, Vic 

 

 Lower the legal driving age for farmers’ sons because with or without a  licence, they will drive.  Tristan, 14, Varley, WA   

 Put all problem juveniles in jail for the day with the hope of perhaps deterring  them of any future crime.  Whilst in jail for the day, I’d pay the jailbirds to scare  the life out o f the juveniles.    Female, 19, Wynnum, QLD 

 

 Driver training- teaching young people better observation skills, enforcing road  position, eg slower cars in the right hand lane on the M1 highway.  Cameron, 22, Wellington Point, QLD   

 Implement a compulsory driver safety course for those who hold a licence.  â¢ Must occur every 3 years  â¢ Must achieve a practical driving test  â¢ Cost to be subsidised by government  â¢ Part of this course should entail that the driver undergo a cycle ride in 

 traffic in preference to a mock situa tion  Male, 19, Birkdale, QLD 

 

 Ban cigarettes, make streets safer for women (gang rapes etc).  Clair, 14, Corrimal, NSW

 Section 3 - National Youth Week Activities and 

 Feedback  

 

 National Youth Week had a different flavour for Labor MPs in 2002.   

 The leader Simon Crean, Youth spokesperson Nicola Ro xon (35) and young  MPs Kirsten Livermore (32, Qld), Christian Zahra (29, Vic), Tanya Plibersek  (32, NSW) and Michelle O’Byrne (34, Tas) all stepped into the shoes of some  of Australia’s young people during the week of April 7th-14th.     

 The philosophy was “If young people won’t come to us - we will go to them.”   

 The media constantly tells us young people aren’t interested in and don’t like  politics - so these Labor MPs went to the places where young people work,  study and relax to try and find out more about their interests and their  expectations of politicians.    

 Attached you will find feedback from the experiences of some of these MPs  and what they learnt from this hands on experience, as well as the diary of  activities they participated in.  Many of the consultations allowed for more  detailed discussions on issues that could only be covered briefly in the survey.   

 As such, the feedback from the Youth week activities in combination with the  survey results, provide a good mix of information for the Labor Party to draw  upon in its future policy development.

  Feedback from National Youth Week activities   

  Nicola Roxon MP, Federal Labor Member for Gellibrand and Shadow  Minister for Children and Youth:    

  Coles Footscray, shift as retail trainee   

  The local management and head office of Coles put together a very  professional and thorough program for me for the day which gave me a great  overview about Coles, the workings of the store, training and so on.  Many of  the management staff were themselves also young (mid/late 20s) and very  proud of their company and enthusiastic about the options ahead of them.   

  After induction and safety training I shadowed one of the retail trainees (on  and off) for the whole shift.  We started on  “facing up” (bringing the stock  forward to make shelves look more tidy) and worked through check out,  marking down meat and bakery items.   

  I learnt a great deal about the store and was struck by how busy it was and  how hard it must be to have enough staff.  The trainees, casuals and part-timers all commented on the wages being pretty low.  For those studying they  seemed to very much appreciate the security of permanent part -time rather  than casual work (an active policy of the company apparently).   

  Handling customers in a busy store was clearly a challenge - some of the  youngest staff seemed to bear the brunt of impatient or rude customers.    

  The day was very practical and was a good grounding for the more detailed  roundtable discussion held on Wednesday with a broader group of trainees -  free from the distractions of the workplace.   

  Young business people consultation   

  Issues raised  â¢ Interest in economics/ business but want social responsibility  â¢ Job security from skills, not from employer - focus on self reliance  (and thus importance for young people to have those skills), no 

  expectation of one job  â¢ Dismissive of old work cultures but interested in some type of  “culture/ image” (impressed by the maverick appeal of Richard 

  Branson).

  Coles Institute consultation forum with retail trainees   

  Very mixed views about the value of their retail traineeships:  â¢ all liked the full-time work  â¢ all concerned about low wages ($6-9 per hour)  â¢ mostly very attracted to the 12 month stable employment the 

  traineeship gives  â¢ many confident of it being first step in career path, quick career  progression of others an incentive  â¢ largely positive about national accreditation and certificates, some 

  unsure about value  â¢ many concerned about employment beyond the traineeship period  â¢ experience and views very dependant on store manager  â¢ transfers within firm can guarantee job, but don’t consider 

  accommodation or transport pressures as a result  â¢ uncertainty after 12 months finishes - would like to know if they  were going to have a permanent job earlier (ie rather than waiting 

  until traineeship is over)  â¢ difficulties in balancing parenting, but like stability of job   

  Other work issues raised:  â¢ morale of other workers, especially casuals, affected if they feel  hours are cut back and trainees area cheaper option  â¢ very aware of the SDA as their union and a place to go for help over 

  obtaining ongoing employment, for harassment and other problems  â¢ permanent part-time (instead of casual) seemed to work well for  those studying  â¢ who to go to if harassed or threatened   

  Other issues discussed  â¢ unfairness of youth allowance, measured by the income of parents  whether or not parents provide support to them  â¢ Centrelink only looks at physical abuse not emotional abuse when 

  measuring if you are forced to live out of home  â¢ Personal safety and sentences for crimes raised - worried about  security and want harsher penalties, victims of crimes live with it for 

  life 

  â¢ Safety on public transport  â¢ Offered drugs everywhere just because young - some friends as  young as 14 trading drugs  â¢ Affect of smoking dope on driving - need for advertisements to 

  show the dangers of doing this.  â¢ Unfamiliar with, but interested in, political parties and how to join

  Kirsten Livermore, Federal Labor Member for Capricornia:   

  Youth Week is actively celebrated in Rockhampton with a range of activities.   It was a highlight of the week to have Simon Crean visit Rockhampton on the  first day of Youth Week 2002 to kick things off.   

  In anticipation of Simon’s visit, Kirsten initiated a project entitled “Voice of  Youth” using her internet website to encourage young people in Central  Queensland to participate in a youth forum.  A temporary feature was  established on her website to allow young people to make submissions  addressing the drain of young people from Central Queensland.   

  Kirsten asked them to submit their thoughts on why young people were  leaving Central Queensland and what could be done to keep them in our  region to pursue their goals.  Those who took the time to make submissions  were invited to participate in a youth forum with Simon.  Kirsten organised the  forum with the interest and support of local schools and youth organizations.   

  The general view of those who responded was that there was insufficient  variety of courses, traineeships and ultimately jobs offered in Central  Queensland and that this necessitated relocating to Brisbane or other centres  to seek their preferred options.     

  Ten young people responded and Simon and Kirsten were impressed with  their willingness to discuss their views articulately and frankly at the forum.   As Kirsten stated in a press release days before the forum: ”Our leaders need  to sit down with young people so they can better understand their concerns  and aspirations.  After all, we govern to ensure a better future for them.”   

  Sample comments from the participants are as follows:   

  Naomi Barnbaum recognises that the grass is not always greener on the other  side of the fence but she understands the lure of experiencing life in the “Big  Smoke”.  The lack of availability and cost of transport in regional centres was  a factor in young people’s decision to leave - if you stay in a regional town it  is difficult to access any of the activities the cities have to offer because of the  cost of travel.  She feels educational and career opportunities will be greater  in bigger cities.  “Central Queensland does not offer a course I am considering  doing.”   

  Nikita Pahl similarly believes that young people leave CQ because of the lack  of opportunities here.  While the university has a variety of subjects she feels  many young people will still have to leave CQ to pursue careers “We as a  community need to make this town appeal to business, larger or small to  locate here.”  Nikita suggests a range of small businesses that may be able to  set up in Rocky as a flow on from the Stanwell magnesium project.  “Another  good investment for CQ could be the opening of a permanent Australian-Singaporean-American military base building on the regular exercises already  conducted in our region.  Nikita is actively involved in youth activities in the  semi-rural town of Gracemere near Rocky.

  Peter Hamilton too believes a lack of courses at the uni and TAFE is a  problem.  “Universities and other training companies have to offer more  interesting courses and be more flexible with young people.”  But he also  acknowledges that leaving town is seen as part of growing up and seeking a  new and independent life in a big city.   

  Brent Richards suggests a survey be conducted in high schools to determine  what higher education courses could be made available.   

  Karissa Sauer and Angela Kelly believe there is a need to fund and support  alternative education models to help young people who don’t fit into the  traditional school system.  This is a way to help young people who have had  many setbacks and who need extra personal support not possible in a  conventional school setting.  They believe many young people would benefit  from more practical hands-on training schemes.   

  Karissa and Angela attend the Full Service School in the coastal town of  Yeppoon which was up until last year funded by the Federal Government.  It  is now struggling to keep its doors open despite the success it has shown in  helping young people get a second chance at an education.  The local council  and State Education Department are doing their best to keep it viable.   

  Young people in Yeppoon - a fast growing but still developing centre with  high unemployment - face several disadvantages such as lack of support  services and the cost of transport into Rockhampton the main source of jobs  and training opportunities.   

  Another view expressed at the forum was the perceived need for greater  interaction between students and workplaces.  Young people need to know  what opportunities exist for them career-wise in the local region and therefore  what skills and qualifications they will need to set their sights on to pursue  those options.  Then they need access to affordable training and education to  gain appropriate experience and qualifications.  Local business and  community leaders need to include young people in their thinking and  planning.   

  Young people need to be included fully in the community and made to feel an  important and integral part of the community.  The young people we spoke to  are full of ideas and energy and just want to be given a voice and a way of  participating in our community.   

  It was identified that young people in regional areas face significant  disadvantage in terms of the cost of living away from home to pursue the  educational course of their choice.  If the course is not offered locally families  are forced to effectively fund two households while students are educated in  the city - additional costs a city family would not necessarily face.  This came  out as a big factor limiting the students’ aspirations.

  There were many complaints about the lack of activities and venues for young  people in our region and the comment was made that the lifestyle and options  available for young people  at the age of 13 and 14 becomes significant when  they are making decisions about their future at the end of school.  It is hard to  turn around a negative impression of the town and expect young people to  decide to stay in a place they’ve spent years wanting to escape.   

  Simon and Kirsten also attended a luncheon at Capricornia Training Company  a local group training company to meet with apprentices and trainees from a  range of occupations including administration, aviation and mechanical.   

  All the trainees/apprentices agreed that from their experiences persistence is  required to get a job.  All of the trainees/apprentices spoke of knocking on  doors all over town, offering to work as volunteers to get a foot in the door and  applying for many jobs and taking many knock backs before succeeding in  getting a position.  It was obvious that they all had very clear goals about  getting employment and also the need for acquiring a formal qualification  despite the financial sacrifice they were making by living on low wages for the  period of their training.   

  One striking similarity in the stories of each apprentice/trainee was the  presence of some key link that led to the breakthrough into employment - a  parent working in the industry, some related volunteer work, work experience,  a personal hobby that led to important contacts, a school-based traineeship to  make the link to employment.  The linking of young people from school into  business or industry is crucial.   

  Other issues included:   

  â¢ Young people not being able to access government assistance to help  them find work because of parents’ income.   

  â¢ Breakdowns in the link up between school assessment and TAFE  recognising those competencies   

  â¢ Living costs for apprentices undertaking block training at TAFE are high -  especially when apprentices have to go to Brisbane (or for rural areas in  CQ from small towns into Rockhampton)  Some are paying rent to  maintain a place at home and then having to pay to live in Brisbane for  weeks on end for training.   

  On Wednesday Kirsten travelled to Longreach for two days.  This was to  further round out her Youth Week experience in a completely different part of  the electorate.  Longreach is in the heart of Outback Queensland.   

  There she spent the morning working as the administrative assistant to the  manager of the Central Western Queensland Remote Area Planning and  Development Board.  The twist to this activity is that Kirsten was temporarily  replacing popular young local woman Jacqui Burrows in the position while  Jacqui was in Brisbane taking part in the State’s Youth Parliament.

   39 

  

  For the rest of the two days Kirsten lived in as a student at the Longreach  Pastoral College.  Students from all over Australia study here for certificate  and diploma courses in pastoral industries.  Kirsten took part in a practical  session teaching students how to get cattle ready for Show from drafting,  breaking in, grooming and leading the cattle - and cleaning out their stalls!   Tomorrow (Thursday) is horse-riding and then a lecture on animal nutrition.   

  Many of the same themes came out in talking to the students in Longreach.   The big one is the recognition that these days you need a qualification “a bit of  paper” to get anywhere.  Also the course must be relevant to where you are  heading and involve lots of hands-on experience.  Many of these students  could be working on properties now but are taking the time out to develop  formally recognised skills.   

  Youth Week in Capricornia gave Kirsten the opportunity to listen to the cross  section of views of young people in significantly different parts of the large  Central Queensland electorate.   

  Michelle O’Byrne, Federal Labor Member for Bass:   

  I consulted with young people in December 1999 where the following issues  were raised: the lack of social and work related options, the generation gap, a  lack of communication to young people, the transition between secondary and  tertiary education, drug rehabilitation/detoxification and education, the  environment, youth suicide, transport, the lack of interest from politicians, the  portrayal of youth in the media, the lack of community organisation that  provide services to young people, unemployment, bureaucracy involved in  accessing services, housing access and the “brain drain”.   

  It is the Tasmanian “brain drain” issue that I concentrated on during National  Youth Week 2002.  Far too many young people in my state feel that they need  to travel to the mainland to access decent jobs and lifestyle.   

  Therefore I spent an afternoon at Student Works.   

  I participated in a program for grade 9 and 10 kids who are deemed at risk of  dropping out which provides them with AVC Level 1 qualifications in  woodwork, metalwork, carpentry etc.   

  They are a good target group as they alternate between attending school one  week the other they are at work.  They experience both worlds and all the  transition issues.   

  The main issues that these people experience are transport (particularly for  regional kids) and access to training locally - otherwise they won't bother   

  It is very interesting that most of these kids actually have a 'dream' about what  their future job options are that require finishing grade ten.  But without 

  A Snapshot of Youth  Labor’s report to Simon Crean 12 April 2002 

   40 

  assistance via these intervention programs they would not complete grade  ten.   

  We too often right off these troublesome students as not having plans or  direction whereas it appears the biggest obstacle is helping them meet the  connector to those plans.   

  When I visited the sports industry forum on Tuesday, young people expressed  the following:   

  â¢ that they previously didn't know the range of industries in the area,   â¢ they didn't know you could get jobs like that in Tassie,   â¢ were surprised that people came here from interstate for jobs,   â¢ realised after hearing people in the industry that things don't always go 

  the way you plan and   â¢ you often find yourself in jobs you hadn't expected (or don't necessarily  like just to keep your hand in).   

  Participants told me that when searching for employment you cannot give up  when faced with knock backs and that it is very important to volunteer!   

  Interestingly most of the individuals who work in the industry got knock back  after knock back, worked in low paid and menial jobs just to be near the  industry and then in each case something happened that got them over the  line into the perfect job they always wanted.   

  Activities with Simon Crean in Launceston involved an information technology  forum.  Activities were taking place at the time of writing the report.

  Kelvin Thomson, Federal Member for Wills and Shadow Minister for the  Environment and Heritage:   

  As part of youth week activities I travelled to Yandoit, a small farming  community just outside of the Victorian central highlands township of  Daylesford to meet a group of Green Corps participants who are undertaking  a range of environmental projects in the area.   

  Local Federal Member Catherine King and I met the group of ten young  women and men at a local “Land for Wildlife” farm where the group are  fencing off highly significant remnant bushland to prevent stock grazing in this  sensitive area.   

  The site is home to a range of threatened plants and animals that will benefit  directly from the work of this enthusiastic and talented group.   

  The group will also be undertaking revegetation and weed control at the site.   As part of the project, they will also be working on a heritage property in  Castlemaine.   

  I discussed the work with the group, what they were learning from the  experience and what their aspirations were once the project was completed.  Discussions included the challenges associated with finding work once the  project was completed, the prospects for employment in the growing  environment industry sector and the state of the environment generally.   

  

  Please note, not all activities or reports were finalised at the  time of preparing this report so have not been included.

  Section 4 - Feedback from other Youth 

  Consultations   

  Naturally, it is not just during Youth Week when Labor MPs talk to young  people.  The following are some selected consultations and feedback included  to complement the issues identified in the survey and during youth week.   

  A good example of this is the Youth Allowance petition presented to Nicola  Roxon shortly after Orientation weeks at Universities this year:   

  a. Youth Allowance Petition   

  “This petition of students at universities in Australia draws the attention of the  House to growing financial pressures on many Australian university students.   Your petitioners are concerned at the fact that the maximum rate of Youth  Allowance is $150.85 per week for students without children.  Your petitioners  are concerned that the current rate of Youth Allowance forces students to  embark on large amounts of part time work that may detract from their ability  to study.  Your petitioners call for Youth Allowance Payments, particularly age  of independence from parents be reviewed.    

  Your petitioners therefore pray that the House review the rate, conditions and  eligibility of the Youth Allowance.”   

  There were 594 signatories to this petition, from a range of places across the  country, such as Coorparoo, Paddington, Newcastle, Armidale, Launceston,  Airport West and Ringwood.     

  

  b. Oxley Youth Forum   

  Reconciliation   

  After identifying the more prominent cultural backgrounds of our local  community, we brainstormed the current methods aimed at breaking down  cultural division and celebrated multiculturalism. Analysing the effectiveness  of these projects, we discussed the concerns of young people in regard to  cultural division and discussed key issues such as reconciliation.   

  What were the problems?  Young people identified a continued division between different cultures. They  expressed their concern about a lack of appreciation and understanding  concerning reconciliation and various cultures. A desire to be more invo lved in  the reconciliation process was identified as well as the want for more  information and education. Young people are concerned about the separation  of cultures and especially the negative stereotypes, stigmas and most  prominent community opinion. 

  A Snapshot of Youth  Labor’s report to Simon Crean 12 April 2002 

   43 

  

  Good things about multiculturalism  Most noted was the incredible diversity of this country. Young people  expressed their interests in other cultures and desire to know more. They  talked about various school projects and activities that helped to breakdown  the barriers between cultures and how incredibly good this was. They spoke  enthusiastically of unity, respect and understanding.   

  Reconciliation  During discussion the concern and confusion, regarding reconciliation was  evident. They expressed their distress about schools becoming a political  playground, and although they wanted education about reconciliation, they  desired unbiased education. Surprisingly, a desire to learn more about  Australian culture and heritage, for all citizens was also voiced as well as the  passion to breakdown social and cultural barriers.   

  In conclusion, it was a difficult topic to discuss and many were wary of other  people’s reactions but the young people warmed to the task and spoke  eagerly as well as openly. At the end of the day they le ft and little more “fired  up” about multiculturalism and the power that they have as individuals and as  the Youth.   

  

  Drug Rehabilitation   

  A difficult topic to discuss but one, which resulted in heated debate and ardent  suggestions. We began by talking about the current strategies in place to help  young people with drug problems such as education programs, police  reinforcement, goal setting and rehabilitation.   

  Effectiveness of current programs  The consensus was that the current strategies are not really wo rking. The  need for variety was identified as we recognised that each person is different.  They discussed the general effectiveness of various school drug strategies  but noted that the problem is still out there in the community and doesn’t  seem to be going awa y. A concern for younger people who seem to be  continually the targeted by drug peddlers was expressed. Finally, a concern  for the apparent last resort strategies rather than takling the problem at the  source was passionately articulated.   

  Our ideas  Firstly, the more real life approach (similar to the alcohol and driving  campaigns) was identified to be very effective. Various suggestions were  made including: 

  - isolating users who are given intensive education , assistance  including rehabilitation and then reintroduced into the community  - harsher punishment for drug peddlers   - uniform drug laws in Australia  - reducing mixed opinions and ideas regarding drugs 

  A Snapshot of Youth  Labor’s report to Simon Crean 12 April 2002 

   44 

  

  Helping young people: Here and Now  So, where to from here?  Lets educate the community and especially parents about drugs  - We need innovative ways to reach young people 

  - Peer education is incredibly effective  - Peer support networks  - Don’t forget smoking and alcohol abuse which is becoming an  increasing and more alarming problem 

  - Family and community communication is vital   

  In conclusion, the six last points the youth of Oxley wanted to leave you with  on the subject of drugs were:   

  Q. How do we help young people with drug problems?   

  1. Increase family and community communication and education  2. Equip young people to help and support other young people already on  drugs  3. Use innovative strategies aimed at younger people  4. The country must work as a team and the government need to be 

  prepared to be involved morally and financially  5. There needs to be more information and education about current  rehabilitation strategies  We need some new ideas which tackle the problem before we get to the last  resort strategies such as rehabilitation and detoxification 

  

  

  c. Launceston Youth Forum 1 March 2002   

  Held at University of Tasmania, Launceston Campus (O Week)   

  Topic of Forum:  “Reinventing Labor for the 21st Century”   

  Questions addressed by the panel included:  â¢ What sort of Australia should the ALP be seeking to create?  What is  the vision?  â¢ What differentiates Labor?  â¢ Who are we appealing to and what do they want?  â¢ Why are young people turned off by politicians?  â¢ How should the Labor Party work?  How should it be reinvented?  â¢ Who should we be collaborating with? Is the party too inward-looking?   

  A Snapshot of Youth  Labor’s report to Simon Crean 12 April 2002 

   45 

  

  This was a forum that provided young people (and those who worked with  young people in local area) with a forum to talk openly about the issues that  mattered to young people in Tasmania today.  Some of the points made  included:   

  â¢ Feeling that during the last campaign the ALP didn’t get its message  out to young people successfully (campaign dominated by negative  messages from the Government) and that it had more to offer than was  readily apparent. 

  â¢ Important that young people are clearly informed of their rights as  citizens, particularly young workers.  Labor could be a strong voice in  this area. 

  â¢ Labor needs to increase its profile in forums where young people are  meeting/communicating, including websites and internet discussion  rooms 

  â¢ Concerns expressed about Labor’s response to environmental matters  in Tasmania (particularly State Labor)  â¢ Positive ideas/initiatives for young people need to be promoted,  example of Northern Youth Shelter Association, built as a joint venture 

  with the community and local government  â¢ Real problems with young people accessing education, housing in local  area.  â¢ Strong feeling that Labor would be seen by young people as a viable 

  alternative if young people were able to participate more in political  process.  â¢ Very passionate audience, wanting to become engaged in positive  change.   

  

  d. Gellibrand Secondary School SRC group 2002.   

  Comments from the student representatives included:   

  There needs to be increased police patrols in the area to protect young  people, particularly at train stations.  Many young people are concerned about  their personal safety.   

  There is not enough information about mixing drugs with other drugs,  particularly mixing drugs and alcohol.   

  Sex education should be covered twice in a student’s curriculum.  Once in  year 10 and there should be a follow up in year 12.  There was a great  concern about the impact of youth pregnancy. An e xample was raised of a 12  year old who had recently given birth.   

  Employment was a major concern of the attendees to this meeting.  Young  people are finding it hard to get a job.    

  A Snapshot of Youth  Labor’s report to Simon Crean 12 April 2002 

   46 

  There was concern about junior rates of pay.  Many attendees felt that junior  rates resulted in people receiving fewer shifts when they got older.   

  There was strong criticism of the Youth Allowance, particularly the age of  independence and the parental means test.   

  The conditions of people seeking asylum in Australia was raised by the group  - especially the educational facilities available to young asylum seekers.   

  Recreational facilities need to be expanded, such as bike tracks and skate  parks.  Young people feel that they need to have space to “hang out”.   

  There are problems with young people entering into contracts, particularly  with mobile phone retailers.    

  There was also cynicism of politicians; “politicians are only nice to people just  before an election” and “This is the first time I can remember a politician really  talking  to people when there isn’t an election on” were some of the comments.   

  e. Footscray Youth Workers- held at the Maribyrnong City  Council Meeting held on 27 Feb 2002   

  Concern was raised about services for young people aged 12-14 year old.   Many people believed that there was a service gap for this age group and the  Federal Government should address this.   

  Access to Centrelink payments by homeless people was raised.  Many  homeless young people do not have sufficient identification for Centrelink to  approve their eligibility.   

  Providing services and programs that were appropriate for young people from  various ethnic communities was an issue of concern.  For example, several  activities presented to young Muslims during Ramadan were not appropriate.   

  Many young people had raised the issue of the high cost of public transport  and the cost of obtaining a public transport concession card for secondary  compared to tertiary students.     

  Also the TAFEs in the area are not granting a concession on their fees to  Youth Allowance recipients that have a “Low Income” health care card.  Only  “Youth Allowance” health care cardholders were getting a concession.      

  Many of the youth workers were interested in finding out whether or not there  was an adequate provision of funding programs for support services in  geographic areas with a high number of at risk youths.  In particular they felt  that the provision of services was not adequate in the western suburbs of  Melbourne.   

  Many East Timorese young people were not able to access tertiary education  because they are Temporary Protection Visa holders.

  Access  by  young  people  to  recreational  facilities  in  the  area  was  raised.   There  was  a  feeling  that  many  young  people  did  not  have  relevant  and   interesting activities after school which created social problems in the area.   

  f. Naomi Ngo, Youth Co-ordinator Vietnamese Community in  Australia/Victoria Chapter.   

  In recent times, young Vietnamese-Australians have been the focus of  sensational, negative media reports about the alleged e xtent of their  involvement in criminal activities.  This has resulted in the stigmatisation of  these young people and the Vietnamese-Australian community.  These  sensational, negative media reports and images have also added to the  existing division, isolation and defensiveness between the  Vietnamese-Australian community and the mainstream community.     

  The Vietnamese Community in Australia/Victoria Chapter (VCA/Vic.), together  with a group of young Vietnamese-Australians and a number of young people  from Southeast Asian backgrounds, have organised and produced a travelling  photographic exhibition displaying positive and realistic images and written  stories of their lives and experiences.  The exhibition showcases  Vietnamese-Australian young people’s talents, contributions and  achievements, as well as depict the courage, determination and struggles  amongst Vietnamese-Australian young people who are experiencing or have  overcome difficult issues in their lives, such as homelessness, incarceration,  drug and alcohol issues.  Overall, the project aims to portray and promote a  positive image of young Vietnamese-Australians and to raise awareness and  understanding around their needs and issues.   

  An example of this is something that a teacher and I have observed duri ng the  project.  When young people were given disposable cameras and 2 weeks to  take photos, most of them experienced difficulties finishing the role of 24 films  in each camera.  Even after they were given extra time to finish the films,  there were a few cameras with unused films.  It seems to me that most of  these young people have limited positive images of themselves and their  lives, which made me feel sad and concerned.  When I look around to  understand why, the images of youth are largely of delinquenc y,  unemployment, uncertainty, confusion and a bleak future.  This is in contrast  with the images of youth in the past, namely the 60s, when they were thought  of and considered themselves as future leaders, capable of changing the  world and making it a better place for all.   

  Images of Young Vietnamese-Australians aims to adopt the medium used by  the media, that is visual images, to provide a realistic portrayal of the  experiences and lives of these young people.  The project attempts to portray  and promote a  positive image of young Vietnamese-Australians and raise  awareness and understanding around their needs and issues.  It also  attempts to address the prejudice and racism that exist in the media and in  the Australian society generally, in order to create a n understanding and fair  society not only for young Vietnamese-Australians and their community but for 

  A Snapshot of Youth  Labor’s report to Simon Crean 12 April 2002

  everyone regardless of their race, class, gender, age and so forth.  I guess  this project is one of many in Australia that is attempting to address racism  and discrimination, particularly towards young people, and your presence  here today is an indication of your support for the goals that we are aiming to  achieve.  I also believe that together in our various roles in the community we  can achieve these goals a lot faster and create a better society and future for  all young people.

  Section 5 - Areas identified for further 

  policy development work   

  The results of this Report will be a significant source of information for all of  the Labor caucus.     

  In particular, I will ensure that Shadow Ministers are aware of the voices of  young people, and the views expressed within their areas.      

  Obviously in the areas of employment, education, environment, sport and  treasury there is some significant feedback.  Further, young people's  commitment to social justice and interest in, for example, helping the poor,  should be borne in mind in our overall determination of priorities.   

  This document will be an important tool, as part of Labor's policy review and  our broader consultation with the community.   

  In addition, I have identified some specific areas for Labor to consider  undertaking further policy development work as a result of this report:   

  1 Labor should reassess the financial pressures on young people  in a range of areas and investigate options for improvement:   

  â¢ Adequacy of Youth allowance and eligibility for it, particularly impact of  tests regarding "independence"  â¢ youth wages (and ensuring trainee wages tie properly to training)   â¢ impact of casualisation and part-time work   â¢ impact of the GST   

  2 Sport and music 

  

  Given the heavy interest in sport, and the identification of the need for further  facilities, Labor needs to investigate a pro-active role in this area.   Labor  should consider young people’s recreational needs, access to public space  and ways for the Commonwealth to support positive recreation facilities.   

  â¢ Labor needs to explore the link between prevention of other anti-social  behaviour later in life and provision of positive recreation activities.   This  should be explored further in combination with our approach to urban  planning, youth health and sport.   

  â¢ In this, we need to include “new” sports such as street sports.  Recently  the Australian Sports Commission released an initiative 1800 Reverse  Street Active, aimed at expanding the numbers of young people involved  in sports commonly kno wn as ‘street sports,’ which include  skateboarding, freestyle BMX, inline skating, inline hockey and inline  speed skating.  Labor could examine a broader commitment to this

  positive move in recognising and supporting the activities of young  Australians.     

  â¢ From our survey it was obvious that many young people are interested in  music/dancing/singing.  In Senate Estimates in February 2002, the  Department of Family and Community Services confirmed that the Battle  of the Bands competition will not receive funding this year.  This was a  successful project for young people, in an area of key interest to them  and its removal of funding is a step backward.  We should consider  committing to re-establishing such a program     

  3 Personal Safety and Driver safety    

  Young people are often identified only as perpetrators of crime, and it is  forgotten that they too are often victims of crime.  Certainly, they are often  vulnerable and concerned about personal safety - in their streets, at school  and on public transport.  In our approach to urban planning, Labor needs to  consider how to include the issue of security for young people.    

  Further, given that the Commonwealth is a major funder of roads and  supporter of the car industry, Labor should consider any better role the  Commonwealth can play at a national level in dealing with driver training and  education.   

  4 Consider commitment to a universal year twelve equivalent for  young people     

  As an option to universal secondary school, look at equivalent commitment to  free education through TAFE or other providers.   Costs of TAFE, varying  access conditions, barriers to entry were raised in consultations.  This is a  policy proposal that could have a great impact on young people’s levels of  training & education.  Further work should be done to look at the interaction  between schools and TAFE and international comparisons - also on cost  implications and potential pick up rates.   

  5 Labor should consider re-examining the traineeship regime   

  â¢ rates of pay  

  â¢ adequacy of training  â¢ the level of recognition of accredited training/ certificates  â¢ commitment to ongoing employment   

  6   Labor should look at better ways for the Commonwealth to provide  more information and support:   

  â¢ In the workplace for young workers, and especially first time workers,  about their rights and responsibilities in relation to their employer and  where to go to get further help.

  â¢ On consumer protection, financial management & debt for young  people.  Particularly impact from purchasing mobile phones, Internet  purchases, credit cards, and difficulty dealing with banks and obtaining  loans with casual jobs.     

  7 Cynicism/ engagement   

  Some Young people clearly have a cynical attitude towards their federal  Government and politicians in general.  Labor will need to think about how the  Opposition and as a future federal government it will engage more with young  people.   

  The National Youth Roundtable, introduced by the Federal Government has  done little to improve the perception that politicians are not interested in  listening to the views of young people.  The need for an effective youth peak  advocacy organisation remains.   

  8 Consider the philosophy of the Triple Bottom Line   

  Young business people (and others) have expressed their complex  commitment to the three imperatives of the economy, society and the  environment.  There is some recognition that all three are interdependent.   Labor could do further work on this issue as it clearly is a philosophy that  blends the multiple interests/ concerns of young people.
