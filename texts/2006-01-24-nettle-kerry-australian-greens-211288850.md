 To show that the Department of Immigration has changed its ways, the Government should allow  access to the West Papuan boat people held on Christmas Island, Greens Senator Kerry Nettle said today.    

 Senator Nettle was addressing a rally outside the Melbourne office of the Department of  Immigration in support of the 43 West Papuan boat people.    

 "It is a week since the West Papuans arrived in Australia, yet the Government is still holding them  incommunicado, Senator Nettle said.    

 "They should not be in detention and they certainly should be allowed to communicate with the  outside world. The Department of Immigrations actions so far indicate that it still puts public  relations before the welfare of its prisoners.    

 "I will go to Christmas Island this weekend and meet with the West Papuans. The Minister of  Immigration and the Department is obligated under the Migration Act to allow me to meet with  the asylum seekers."    

 

 "The invasion and occupation of West Papua has already cost over 100,000 lives. Like East Timor  the Australian Government should shift its policy and support human rights and independence."    

 "The restarting of military training and a new security agreement with Indonesia makes Australia  complicit in the escalating human rights violations in West Papua. Refusing asylum for the West  Papuans would compound this complicity. Senator Nettle said.
