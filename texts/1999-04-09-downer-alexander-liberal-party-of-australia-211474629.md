  TRANSCRIPT of HON ALEXANDER DOWNER MP

  Minister for Foreign Affairs

  

  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, ADELAIDE

  

  9, APRIL, 1999

  

  SUBJECT: KOSOVO. MISSING CARE WORKERS. ALBANIAN REFUGEES. EAST TIMOR

  

  MINISTER:

  

 Look, I just want to say something about Steve Pratt 
and Peter Wallace who are the two Australians who have gone missing 
in Yugoslavia who worked for CARE Australia. We now understand that 
the two Australians are being detained in Yugoslavia by Yugoslav authorities. 
We, in that case, very much want the Yugoslav authorities immediately 
to release the two Australians and to allow them to leave the country. 
There’s a great deal of publicity associated with the three American 
soldiers in Yugoslavia and we hope very much that those three soldiers 
will be released but for us as Australians this is the fate of the two 
Australians who are, we believe, being detained by Yugoslav authorities 
is a matter of equal importance, and indeed, since they’re Australians, 
for us, and we would say personally is one of greater importance. Now, 
yesterday my department on my instructions called in the Yugoslav Ambassador 
and explained to him our continuing concern about the two Australians 
and our request that they should be released. During the latter part 
of yesterday, I decided to send the Australian Ambassador to Belgrade, 
who had been evacuated some time ago from Belgrade, back to Belgrade 
in order for him to make appropriate representations in person to the 
Foreign Ministry and, indeed, to the Foreign Minister himself, and to 
other officials in Yugoslavia demanding that the Australians be released. 
The Ambassador is now back in Belgrade, he got back there safely during 
the course of the night and he will be during today making those appropriate 
representations. We remain very concerned about the two Australians 
who have been, we understand, who are being detained. We want those 
Australians released; these are people who have been doing humanitarian 
work, working with refugees in Kosovo but they have also been working 
with displaced Serbians as well. They are not participants in the political 
affairs of the region and they should be released and allowed to leave 
the country as soon as possible. 1 really wanted to make that point.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Mr Downer, CARE Australia wants to send a delegation 
to Belgrade. Do you support that push?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 I have no problems with CARE Australia sending people 
to Belgrade provided they do so with the Australian Embassy officials. 
We would have been happy for the Ambassador to be accompanied by a CARE 
person but the one person they have there is a British citizen and our 
responsibility’s of course to Australian citizens, not citizens of 
other nations. But we’ll obviously, as an in-principled, we have been 
waiting, as a practice, we’ve been working very closely with CARE 
Australia and we’ll continue to do that.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Yugoslavia’s Deputy Prime Minister says that he’ll 
look into the matter of the Australians being held. Do you trust that 
he will?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 Well, I’ve no reason to believe he won’t. But 
the, look, the point here is that we have been making representations 
to the Yugoslav Government for a good deal of time now. These Australians 
have been detained for over a week and we haven’t heard from them 
and the fact is we have spoken with the Ambassador on a number of occasions, 
our Ambassador has spoken with a large number of officials in Yugoslavia. 
The Deputy Prime Minister himself may have not been aware, as he said, 
of this particular case, but Yugoslav authorities are aware of it. We 
are surprised that there has been no news about these Australians. At 
one stage we reached a point where we just had no idea where they possibly 
could be; today I’m saying that we do understand they are being detained 
by official authorities in Yugoslavia and we want them released.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Is there any word of their condition?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 No, I have no news on their condition.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Why were they arrested, do you know?

  

  MINISTER:

  

  No, we haven’t been given any information by the Yugoslav authoritie s 
on that.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Other countries such as Italy involved in relation, 
countries which have embassies in Belgrade, can there be moves to get 
them involved in helping to get the Australians released?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 Well, we have made, not Italy actually, but we have 
made contact with a number of other countries to assist us. One of the 
countries we’ve turned to is Russia, another is Japan, and the Japanese 
Ambassador, Japan has an Ambassador in Belgrade, so we’ve made representations 
in Tokyo to the Japanese to ask them for assistance as well. We have 
been using other countries, certainly. We’ve tended not, of course, 
to use NATO countries in the present circumstances, you could understand.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Has Mr Lamb made enough representations. If the Deputy 
Prime Minister wasn’t aware though, does that raise questions about 
whether or not Australia has made enough.

  

  MINISTER:

  

 No, I think that raises question about the Yugoslav 
authorities, that doesn’t raise any questions about Australia. I have 
no idea why the Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia didn’t know. I 
don’t know what the Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia knows or doesn’t 
know but I can tell you this, we have made a very large number of representations 
over the last week and obviously Yugoslav authorities are fully aware 
of that. We have not been given any formal information by the Yugoslav 
authorities throughout that period of time; they have simply said that 
they didn’t have information. We now understand the Australians are 
being detained and we want those Australians released.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Can you say where they’re being detained and by 
whom specifically and also how you found out where they are?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 No.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Is the Yugoslav Government in a position to deal effectively 
with this matter at the moment? Can it concentrate on this issue?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 Well, they seem to be able to concentrate on the fate 
of the three American soldiers and so I think they should be able to 
concentrate on the fate of the two Australians as well. I mean, I very 
much hope the three American soldiers are released, so they should be. 
But equally, and as the Australian Foreign Minister, perhaps I should 
say ‘more importantly’, I would like to see the two Australians 
who are not soldiers but are aid workers, I’d like to see the two 
Australians released and these people, I understand, are being detained 
and I want them released.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Is it a high priority, to actually, with respect of 
Australia, for them to actually meet and see these two CARE workers 
for themselves?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 I have no idea. The Australian Ambassador has gone 
back into Belgrade now; he will be seeing during the course of today 
Yugoslav officials; he’ll be making representations rather than on 
the phone, which he’s been doing, he’ll be able to do it in person. 
I very much hope he’ll be seeing the Foreign Minister during the course 
of today or tomorrow and we hope that as a result of sending him back 
into Belgrade with all the associated risks there are for him and the 
other Australian official who’s travelling with him, we hope that 
this will yield a more productive result than the representations we’ve 
made up until now.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Albanian authorities, Albanian community, have met 
with you this morning. How did those talks go and how many refugees 
do you think we can expect here in South Australia?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 I’m not sure how many will be coming to South Australia. 
I mean, Mr Ruddock is making a statement today, I think he’s done 
that already, and at this stage there isn’t any specific planning 
for South Australia but I’d just say I think there is good chance 
that some of the refugees will come to South Australia, as not just 
the Foreign Minister but also as a South Australian MP, I hope some 
of them do come to South Australia; they’d be very welcome in South 
Australia.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 What would be the cost, Mr Downer, of the refugee 
effort for Australia to accommodate them and where would that come from? 
Will it be from the aid budget?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 Well, we’ll have to get some budget supplementation 
for it and which budget it will be channelled through hasn’t been 
worked out yet. It’s a very detailed question, I mean one of the considerations 
is the aid budget but it could be through the Immigration Department’s 
budget. I mean, it shouldn’t really matter. I mean, the money will 
be provided, I think the figure we’re looking at is approximately 
$15m for the whole of the exercise, on top of the $6m that we’re providing 
directly to the United Nations and to non-government organisations. 
So, yes, it’s an expensive business but it’s important for humanitarian...

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 What was the basis of the talks today?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 Well, they wanted first of all to express their appreciation 
of the stance the Australian Government has taken over the NATO attacks. 
They secondly wanted to discuss the refugees. They’re obviously pleased 
that we’re prepared ourselves to take some of the refugees and they 
would like to see a continuation of support from the Australian Government 
for the plight of ethnic Albanians in and out of Kosovo and I’ve obviously 
given them that commitment.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Did they raise concerns?

  

  MINISTER:

  

  They didn’t raise concerns about what the Australian Government 
is doing. They raised some detailed things: they want a tax deduction 
for an Albanian community fund and we’ll look at that, they’re put ting 
in an application. They’d like to see the establishment of an honorary 
consulate in Albania by the Australian Government, I mean, I think that 
would be a possibility. I think we can probably accommodate that if 
we find the right person to act as the honorary consul.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Would the money that Australia is spending to accommodate 
the refugees, could that be better spent providing accommodation for 
them in European countries?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 Well, I think we’re doing a combination of things 
here. We're bringing some refugees to Australia, I think Australians 
would like to feel that we will continue with the tradition of being 
a country which is a refuge for people in particular distress around 
the world, that’s a great Australian tradition and I’m glad we are 
continuing that tradition. But, we are providing a lot of support to 
people like the Red Cross, to CARE, the United Nations High Commission 
for refugees and a number of other countries are supporting them as 
well. So, I think we can do more than one thing. We can achieve a number 
of objectives through the broad policy that we’re pursuing.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Are you suggesting that the release of the two Australians 
should be a higher priority than the soldiers because they are, unlike 
the soldiers, they are humanitarian aid?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 Well, I’m the Australian Foreign Minister so let 
me say that I very much hope that the American soldiers are released. 
But for me, I want to see the two Australians released. These are not 
soldiers, these are aid workers and they are Australian aid workers 
and I think they should be released and they should be released immediately 
and what, I guess, is of concern to me is that I have been advised that 
these people are apparently being detained by Yugoslav authorities. 
So, now that I know that, I want them released.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Mr Downer, on another matter, is there now not an 
urgent need for an international security force in East Timor?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 Well, we don’t really have anything to add to what 
we’ve been saying all along on this, but let me just say in relation 
to the Liquica killings that have taken place on the 6  th  
and possibly on the 7  th  of April. Our Ambassador, Mr McCarthy, 
met with General Wiranto yesterday and he, needless to say, expressed 
his grave concern on behalf of the Australian Government about what 
has happened in Liquica. General Wiranto assured him that there would 
be an independent inquiry into the incident, incident or incidents and 
that indicated this inquiry could be conducted by the International 
Commission for the Red Cross. We obviously welcome an independent inquiry 
of that kind. Furthermore, during the course of today, today or tomorrow, 
officers from the Australian Embassy in Jakarta will be visiting East 
Timor and going to Liquica and we’ll be able to investigate the situation 
ourselves on the ground there as well. Look, an incident like this is 
obviously a tragedy, we are appalled at what has happened. We have said 
on many occasions that we want to see the Indonesian Government and 
the armed forces do more to contribute towards the disarming of the 
paramilitaries, but we call on all parties in East Timor to act with 
restraint. What we want to do is to see the United Nations talks go 
ahead at the end of this month, as they are the official talks that 
have been put off for a week. But the actual Ministerial talks are still 
scheduled for the same day. We hope that as a result of those talks 
there will be agreement on the autonomy package to be put to the people 
of East Timor. We then hope that it will be possible to get some UN 
personnel on the ground to help with confidence building in the lead 
up to and during the process of consultation on whether East Timor becomes 
independent or accepts the autonomy package, and once that question 
is resolved, then there will no doubt be a case for more UN personnel. 
But, at this stage the important thing is that all parties, be they 
the Indonesian Government, the Indonesian military, the paramilitaries, 
the pro-independent guerillas, but all parties act with a great deal 
of restraint. I know there are high risks of violent instances in an 
environment like this, no question of that, but we really do want people 
to act with restraint.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 But, isn’t it possible that as these talks go on 
and independent investigations are underway, that in fact the place 
could blow up very quickly with this new call to arms from Gusmao?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 Well, I hope not, no. Xanana Gusmao has clarified 
his statement and he hasn’t, as he’s pointed out and as I’ve pointed 
out on the ‘7.30 Report’ the other night too, he has said that, 
not a call to arms, it’s a call on the pro-independence people in 
East Timor to protect themselves. But not to go out and launch attacks 
on people, it’s not a call for civil war. As you’ve put it, it’s 
not a call to arms. So, I said a couple of days ago violence begets 
violence, and what we don’t want to see is a continuation of the cycle 
of violence. I know that’s a big ask, I know that’s tough, but I 
think if everybody from the Indonesian Government and ABRI, through 
to the paramilitaries and the guerillas and the pro-independence people 
act with restraint then we can see this through. But, this is an enormously 
difficult process and people here in Australia have to be, have to understand 
the difficulties involved in the process.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Is Australia still committed to putting personnel 
in there for their autonomy ballot or is it too dangerous now?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 Well, the autonomy ballot isn’t today, there is 
a way to go. I mean, we remain with the United Nations committed to 
getting some people on the ground, but we can’t do that until once 
the negotiations in New York later this month are concluded, then after 
that I think the Indonesians will be more willing to have some United 
Nations personnel on the ground. But, I can just tell you this, we have 
officers from the Australian Embassy going into East Timor today and 
tomorrow. We believe that the risks to them are, well there are always 
risks, but we take precautions. But, the situation is such that they 
can go to East Timor. We have an AusAID team going to East Timor in 
a couple of weeks time. We have no plans to change the timing of that 
visit and our Embassy has advised us that the visit should proceed, 
so you know, I think the incidence in Liquica is a very serious one 
and deeply regrettable. But, you know, we hope there isn’t going to 
be a continuation of that sort of activity.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Do you there’s, some analysts are saying that Gusmao 
was actually given the nod from Jakarta to make those comments because 
they are losing some control on the ground in East Timor. Do you think 
there is anything in that?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 Shouldn’t think so. In fact, it sound’s like it’s 
fairly unlikely, not one that I’m aware of, pretty unlikely.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 What, is there an element of brinkmanship, do you 
think, to what he said?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 No, I think he’s responding to concerns expressed 
by a lot of people in East Timor. No, I think there was some confusion 
about what his position actually was, that was because he didn’t make 
the statement directly himself, he used a lawyer to make the statement 
and then he clarified his statement subsequently. So, the statement 
that was originally made came across a little, I think a little as we 
saw it and as l saw and as a number of people saw it, a bit more harshly 
than was intended. But, I mean, I think, you know, what he is saying 
to people is they should be prepared to defend themselves, he’s not 
saying that there’s a call to arms and we should have a sort of war 
in East Timor and resolve the situation that way.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 But, can you just clarify, Portugal is saying that 
it’s time for a UN security force in there. Why does Australia not 
agree?

  

  MINISTER:

  

  I don’t think Portugal is saying exactly that. I must say, I am 
not aware of their exactly, well, they’re not calling for UN peacekeeping 
force. Well, look, I don’t know why there is even a discussion about 
this. If you want to send in  a peacekeeping force you have to 
have a whole range of pre-conditions. You want to send a peacekeeping 
force you have to have, first of all, the country itself where you want 
to send the peacekeeping force willing to receive it, otherwise you 
are going to declare war on them. In this particular case, Indonesia 
doesn’t, at the moment, want a peacekeeping force and would not agree 
to one. Secondly, the UN does not want to send in a peacekeeping force, 
and if there were to be a peacekeeping force it would have to be a UN 
peacekeeping force. Thirdly, there has to be a peace to keep, unless 
you are talking about a completely different proposition, which is sending 
in a military force in order to act as a peace enforcement operation, 
not a peace keeping force. But if you want a peace keeping force you 
have to have a peace to keep and at the moment, that is not the situation 
in East Timor. There are a number of difficult processes to go through. 
So, we hope that despite the outbreaks of violence that there have been, 
that the situation will be sufficiently under control for there not 
to be a need for a peacekeeping force. But, in the end, we will have 
to wait and see. But, we are working very closely with the United Nations, 
we are in constant communications with the UN about this. We have been 
making strong representations to the Indonesian Government, we have 
of course been having discussions with Xanana Gusmao and his people. 
This is an enormously difficult process. Now, there are a lot of people 
in Australia who have very, very strong feelings about this and often 
they are very partisan feelings and I’m not being critical of any 
of those people but, I am making the point that Australia can’t, just 
at the snap of our fingers, fix this problem. If we could fix it with 
a snap of our fingers, we’d have done it long ago. It is a very, very 
difficult problem and it requires great wisdom to manage, and unwise 
decisions made for cheap political reasons are going to cause a worse 
problem that wise and considered decisions with a bit of patience.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Do you think Jakarta can control its forces on the 
ground there and the paramilitary?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 It’s important that they do

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Do you think they can?

  

  MINISTER:

  

 Well, I don’t know about the paramilitary, but they 
control their forces and well, in the case of the Liquica incident which 
is, well, I guess why you asked the question, we look forward to seeing 
the results of the investigation into it. There have been a number of 
allegations made about ABRI involvement that they just stood by and 
didn’t do anything or what they did was inadequate or that they were 
apparently somewhat partisan. But, we look to see what the results of 
the inquiry are and our Ambassador has raised Australia’s concerns 
with General Wiranto himself about that.
