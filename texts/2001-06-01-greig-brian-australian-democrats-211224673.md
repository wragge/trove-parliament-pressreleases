  Australian Bill of Rights 

  urgently needed to address   Australia’s human rights failures 

  Call for debate on the Democrats’ Bill of Rights. 

  Criticism by Amnesty International of Australia’s dismal human rights performance has renewed   Democrats’ calls for the urgent introduction of an Australian Bill of Rights. 

  Democrats Law and Justice spokesperson, Senator Brian Greig, says if the Government is intent on   ignoring United Nations treaties and denigrating United Nations scrutiny, then it must provide   alternative human rights safeguards for Australian citizens. 

  “Amnesty International’s Annual Report, released yesterday, is scathing of Australia’s performance on   refugees and asylum seekers, Aboriginal deaths in custody, mandatory #sentencing laws and Australia’s   withdrawal from United Nations scrutiny,” Senator Greig said. 

  “Australia’s ongoing failure to meet international human rights standards shows the need for   comprehensive domestic human rights legislation.” 

  Amnesty International’s Annual Repon. stated that ‘treaty rights have no legal status in Australia and   cannot be invoked in domestic courts, leaving gaps in Australia s human rights system and impeding   the recognition and applicability of treaty provisions. ’ 

  “It is one of the unfortunate contradictions by the Howard Government that on the one hand, it criticises   references to international human rights standards as a violation of our sovereignty, but then refusl:s to   exercise that sovereignty to give Australia its own enforceable human rights standards,” Senator Cireig   said.
