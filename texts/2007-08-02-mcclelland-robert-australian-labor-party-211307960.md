 ROBERT MCCLELLAND MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS   

 Address to the Foreign Correspondents Association 

 Sydney 

 2 August 2007 

 

 STRENGTHENING THE AUSTRALIA-US ALLIANCE 

 

 The Labor tradition  

 

 Both sides of Australian politics have a history of strong support for the 

 Australia-United States alliance.  It is a relationship between the people of our 

 two countries.   

 

 In that sense it is an article of faith that the relationship is one that transcends 

 party politics. The administrative power of political parties in our two great 

 democracies is transient.  But the relationship between our two people has 

 endured irrespective of which political party holds office. 

 

  In 1968, as Leader of the Opposition, Gough Whitlam said: 

 

 “For Australia the phrase ‘American Alliance’ covers two things. The 

 formal part of the alliance is our mutual obligation under ANZUS, 

 which, as the Labor platform says, is ‘crucial and must continue’. The 

 other and more important part of the alliance is a matter of spirit and 

 attitude.”1

 

  1

 If anyone is in any doubt about the significance of the United States to 

 Australia they need only visit war graves of the thousands upon thousands of 

 United States servicemen who died defending our country. 

 

 In seeking that assistance Labor Prime Minister John Curtin said in the 

 clearest terms in 1941: 

 

 “Without any inhibitions of any kind, I make it clear that Australia looks 

 to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with 

 the United Kingdom.”2

 

 Labor has supported the alliance for over 65 years.  Before, I might add, the 

 Liberal Party even existed. 

 

 The significance of our alliance with the United States was recently reaffirmed 

 by Kevin Rudd in the following terms: 

 

 “Labor believes that the United States alliance is overwhelmingly in 

 Australia’s strategic interests…..  Australia could never replicate by 

 national means the access to global intelligence data we can currently 

 access through the US strategic relationship. The alliance also 

 enhances our strategic interests in the Asia Pacific region in an 

 emerging age of great strategic uncertainty.”3

 

 But more than that, as Whitlam said - and as I will discuss later - the alliance 

 is far deeper than a strategic marriage of convenience.  It is a relationship 

 based on genuine affinity and affection between our two people. 

 

 The alliance as a pillar 

 

 I will focus firstly on the security dimension. The alliance with the 

 United States forms one of the three pillars of Labor’s foreign policy 

 framework.  Kevin Rudd outlined in his recent speech to the Global 

 Foundation that: 

  2

 

 “Labor believes that we should base our foreign policy on three strong 

 pillars - our alliance with the United States, our membership of the 

 United Nations and a policy of comprehensive engagement with the 

 Asia-Pacific region.”4

 

 Those pillars are not separate and distinct they are all important supports 

 upon which our nation’s current and future national security interests rest. 

 

 The  Australia-US  alliance  is  entirely  consistent  with  our  engagement  in  the  

 Asia Pacific region at all levels. From a military perspective the 2000 Defence 

 White Paper outlines: 

 

 “For Australia, continued US engagement will support our defence 

 capabilities and play a critical role in maintaining strategic stability in 

 the region as a whole.”5

 

 I will subsequently say a little more about Australia’s relationship with the 

 United States in terms of our broader political, diplomatic and economic 

 engagement in our region. 

 

 As much as and perhaps more than between any other country, the alliance 

 allows Australia access to extensive US intelligence resources, highly critical 

 and sensitive and military technology, preferred status in military equipment 

 purchasing, access to training courses and invaluable combined exercises.6

 

 From the US perspective a key part of the alliance are the Joint Facilities 

 because of their unique intelligence gathering, arms control and disarmament 

 verification, and early warning functions.7  The joint management and 

 operation of these facilities has its own special benefits. 

 

 Indeed, some argue that hosting these installations, and having been 

 prepared to accept the potential strategic risks, remains one of Australia’s 

 most meaningful contribution to the alliance.8  In his speech to the Lowy 

  3

 Institute in August 2006, Kim Beazley made the point that during the Cold 

 War:  

 

 “The fact that we were a “producer” and not a “consumer” of American 

 security was a major contribution to the western side of the central 

 strategic balance.  In short, the Joint Facilities made us the ally the 

 United States needed.  That should always be our aspiration.”9

 

 In addition to intelligence and military capability our broader interests intersect 

 in our own backyard.  The Asia Pacific region is as vital to US strategic and 

 economic interests as it is to Australia. 

 

 As mentioned, the three pillars of Labor foreign policy do intersect on a 

 number of levels.  For instance, Labor since the Hawke and Keating years 

 has been steadfast in our wish to see the US actively involved in regional 

 dialogue and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region - drawing together 

 Labor’s support for the US and our commitment to comprehensive 

 engagement.   

 

 This view was fundamental to developing the Asia Pacific Economic 

 Cooperation (APEC) forum in 1989.  Since 1993 APEC has been a major 

 contributor to developing a forum for regular discussions between the US 

 President and other regional leaders.   

 

 Labor also supported US membership of other forums such as the ASEAN 

 Regional Forum - inaugurated in 1994 during the Keating Government’s 

 period in office.10  ARF is increasingly taking on more and more responsibility 

 in the area of security of counter terrorism, issues of disaster management as 

 well as human security issues.  ARF is also developing a capability in early 

 dispute resolution. 

 

 The ally the United States needs 

 

  4

 Just as no marriage is successful if one party is perpetually submissive - a 

 relationship between two countries must be based on mutual respect and 

 equality of contribution. 

 

 In that context I would like to make a few comments about the current conflict 

 in Iraq. 

 

 In 1991 the Hawke Government supported military action against Iraq which 

 had been endorsed by the UN Security Council.  Labor did not support the 

 invasion of Iraq in March 2003 because it was not endorsed by the UN 

 Security Council.  As recent history has proven, the UN Security Council was 

 wise in awaiting a final response from weapons inspectors it had appointed 

 before determining further action.11  It is regrettable that the partners of the 

 world’s most famous Texan did not encourage him to hold onto his horses 

 until that final inspection occurred.  

 

 Labor’s 2003 decision not to support the invasion of Iraq has generated 

 considerable debate.  Indeed it has lead to much misinformed comment about  

 a Labor Government’s future commitment to the Australia-US alliance.  

 

 Labor has long argued that Australia should play a positive role as an ally with 

 an independent point of view and preparedness to put forward sensible 

 advice.   

 

 This is done by ensuring that Australia develops its own policy analysis and 

 ideas.   In that way we can most effectively contribute to the alliance dialogue. 

 If necessary, at times, we have an obligation to give considered advice to the 

 US which may be contrary to a prevailing view of the incumbent 

 administration in Washington.  This point is made strongly by Kim Beazley 

 who said:  

 

 “It is vastly more important to be the ally the United States needs than 

 to be the ally any particular American administration might want. 

 Having the self-confidence to be the friend our ally needs is in the long-

  5

 term interest of our security. And ultimately, honest advice on the 

 wisdom of a course of action is what delivers the respect of our friends, 

 because mates talk straight“. 12

 

 It is said a good mate always stands by his mate in a flight.  But a better mate 

 will counsel his mate before he gets into a losing fight.  He will also help him 

 find the way home when the other bloke your mate has stepped in to help is 

 exploiting his assistance and prolonging the conflict.  An Australian Labor 

 Government will be that better mate. 

 

 It is quite likely that the situation in Iraq today would be different if in 2003 

 Prime Minister Howard had spoken up to our close ally, as a mate.  Indeed 

 there is every possibility that the political fortunes of the two men may have 

 been different if words of caution had been issued by our Prime Minister.  

 

 But at the end of the day, as interesting as personal reflection can be, our 

 alliance is not a relationship between two men.  It is an enduring relationship 

 between two people - the people of Australia and the United States.  

 

 Labor’s view of the Iraq conflict is in fact in line with many senior American 

 political figures, from both sides of politics. These leaders have spoken out 

 about the ongoing failure in Iraq and the need to change course.  Conversely 

 Mr Howard’s open ended Iraq policy is now offside with at least 11 US 

 Presidential candidates, some 270 Democrat members of the US Congress, 

 some 23 Republican members of Congress and the vast majority of the 

 citizens of America.  Furthermore, a May US opinion poll showed that the 

 majority of Americans favour a timetable for withdrawal of US troops from 

 Iraq.13

 

 Opinion polls should not determine policy but common sense should.  The 

 vast majority of American’s and Australian’s are down to earth people of 

 common sense. 

 

  6

 Labor is not calling for a precipitous overnight withdrawal and we are certainly 

 not leaving our American mates in the lurch.  What we will do is consult 

 heavily with our allies about withdrawing the 550 Australian combat troops 

 who are currently deployed in the south of Iraq.  That is the Battle Group 

 which has already handed over security control to the Iraqis some 12 months 

 ago.  We will not hesitate to deploy a second troop rotation into mid-2008 if 

 required and we will carefully coordinate the withdrawal of the 550 combat 

 troops with the military planning of our allies. 

 

 Our frigate in the Persian Gulf, our Orion surveillance aircraft, our Hercules 

 transport aircraft and our 110 strong Security Detachment in Baghdad will 

 stay to assist our allies in Iraq.  In addition we will provide economic 

 assistance and expertise in border security.  We will also contribute to 

 vigorous diplomatic efforts to draw the international community - including 

 Arab states to finding a political solution to the diaster that is Iraq. 

 

 In short we will be steadfast mates with eyes always on reality.  Our friendship 

 will focus on solutions not just to symbolism. 

 

 The broader significance of our alliance 

 

 I would now like to focus on the broader significance of our relationship with 

 the United States. Briefly returning to the second part of Gough Whitlam’s 

 statement: “the other and more important part of the alliance” which he 

 described as “spirit and attitude”.14

 

 In February this year US Vice President Dick Cheney addressed an audience 

 in Sydney at which I was present. After acknowledging the Prime Minister - an 

 old friend of his, he then expressed his delight to see another old friend - 

 Kim Beazley.  Both had shared time together as Secretary of Defense and 

 Defence Minister respectively.  

 

 The Vice President went on to say: 

 

  7

 “Your country and mine are filled with people who speak plainly and 

 honestly. And surely that's one of the reasons we're natural friends. 

 When Americans think of Australia, we think of a place with a 

 pioneering spirit much like our own. We think of a country that shares 

 our founding commitments to liberty and to equality, and to our 

 traditions of justice and tolerance. We think, above all, of the character 

 of the Australian people -- self-reliant, practical, and good-hearted”15

 

 It is this strong base of shared spirit and attitude, which will ensure that the 

 relationship can and will endure. It is what our strong relationship allows, and 

 indeed requires.  

 

 Our relationship was recently described by US Ambassador Robert McCallum 

 as “multi-faceted”, "extraordinarily broad" and "extraordinarily deep"16.  This 

 strength and depth Labor believes allows us to move forward from Iraq, and to 

 focus head-on upon the range of other challenges that we share. 

 

 Enhancing the alliance by Australia carrying a greater share of the 

 peace and capacity building responsibilities in the Asia Pacific 

 

 Labor firmly believes that the alliance between Australia and the US can be 

 greatly enhanced by Australia carrying a greater share of the peace and 

 capacity building responsibilities in the Asia Pacific region. 

 

 Our region is a place of risks and many complexities. There are challenges of 

 development, economic growth and international security.  There are difficult 

 questions about how to rebuild fragile and weak states that have suffered 

 conflict, community upheaval and a breakdown in the rule of law.  

 

 The long term intention must obviously be to resolve conflict and to prevent 

 future conflict from occurring. Australians are well aware of the security 

 challenges in our backyard.  We are reminded that we live in a fragile and 

 potentially dangerous neighbourhood by multiple military deployments in East 

  8

 Timor and the Solomon Islands, issues of law and order in PNG, unrest in 

 Tonga and Vanuatu and by last year’s military coup in Fiji.  

 

 Failure to address our regional responsibilities risks placing an enormous 

 burden on our nation.  

 

 The United States is already heavily engaged in our region.  But there is 

 absolutely no doubt they would welcome a greater Australian contribution to 

 building regional security and governance capacity in our own arc of 

 responsibility.  

 

 The work of the United States in our region is outstanding. It is regrettable that 

 the value of that work and its significance for regional stability is so 

 undervalued.  I want to take some time to point out a few facts. 

 

 Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization 

 

 The US has created the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and 

 Stabilization, with the mission statement to:  

 

 “lead, coordinate and institutionalise the US Government civilian 

 capacity to prevent or prepare for post-conflict situations, and to help 

 stabilise and reconstruct societies in transition from conflict or civil 

 strife, so they can reach a sustainable path toward peace, democracy 

 and a market economy.”17

 

 It was my pleasure earlier this year to travel the US, and indeed I visited a 

 number of very impressive agencies and organisations whose task it is to 

 address a range of challenges across the Asia Pacific region. 

 

 Centre for Excellence in Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance  

 

 In relation to disaster relief and issues of human security the Centre for 

 Excellence in Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance (COE) is 

  9

 invaluable.  The centre promotes civil and military cooperation to reduce 

 devastation and human suffering caused by disasters - man made and 

 natural. It does this by developing inter-agency as well as international co-ordination. The Centre provides education, training and research assistance 

 in respect to responding events such as the Asian Tsunami and in working to 

 prevent human security crises such as an outbreak of avian influenza.  

 

 The COE has a network of experienced staff of international humanitarian and 

 peace support operations practitioners. The Centre emphasizes the 

 importance of developing and maintaining a strong international network of 

 skilled people with the deployable capabilities.  

 

 While it is all too common to hear a criticism of the United States for taking 

 unilateral action, a key success of the Centre for Excellence has been its 

 ability to develop relationships with a number of international bodies. 

 Relationships have been established with the United Nations High 

 Commission for Refugees, International Committee of the Red Cross, Centres 

 for Disease Control, East West Centre, the United Nations Department of 

 Peace Keeping Operation, US Aid, the World Health Organisation, ASEAN 

 Committee on Disaster Management, the University of Hawaii and World 

 Vision International.18

 

 The major focus areas of COE are: 

 

 â¢ To undertake stability operations following natural and humanitarian 

 disasters; 

 â¢ To assist in responding to complex emergencies; 

 â¢ To undertake humanitarian assistance; 

 â¢ To undertake disaster relief; 

 â¢ To provide peace support operations following civil disorder; 

 â¢ To provide research and developmental assistance in respect to civil-military response planning; 

  10

 â¢ To assist in developing medical and public health response in respect 

 to national and international challenges including HIV Aids mitigation 

 and possible pandemics. 

 

 The emphasis of COE has been on promoting co-operation between military 

 and state civil defence agencies to develop greater synchronization of 

 planning, training and exercises. 

 

 The COE also conducts analysis of disaster response to focus on lessons 

 learnt and the development of best practices. In particular it provided a 

 dispassionate and helpful analysis of inadequacies in the response of the 

 International community, including United States Agencies to the Asian 

 Tsunami Crisis. 

 

 There are a number of units within the COE. 

 

 The Civil Military Relations Unit which promotes an understanding of the roles 

 and advantages of military and civilian entities cooperating to provide 

 humanitarian assistance in crisis, supporting transitions to stability and 

 providing security support during that phase.   

 

 The Humanitarian Affairs unit provides expertise on the conduct of civilian 

 humanitarian operations.  It has access to an extended network of experience 

 humanitarian practitioners around the globe. It focuses on developing 

 education and training resources available to the international humanitarian 

 community. 

 

 The COE also has a specific Pacific Disaster Management Information 

 Network which produces a number of information products covering natural 

 and man made disasters including those arising from conflicts and 

 humanitarian emergencies particularly in the Asia Pacific region.  

 

  11

 The Medical and Public Health Unit of COE focuses on developing innovative 

 ways to support the medical planning activities in meeting complex medical 

 challenges.  

 

 Joint Interagency Task Force West (JIATF-W) 

 

 Up to 90 percent of the world’s methamphetamine seizures and two thirds of 

 the world’s methamphetamine abusers are found in the Asia Pacific region. In 

 fact criminal organisations in China and India are among the world’s top 10 

 chemical producing nations and produce the majority of the world’s ephedrine. 

 The opium trade of Afghanistan is estimated by the United Nations to be in 

 the vicinity of US$3.2 billion annually. 

 

 Trans-national criminal organisations are powerful and exploit weak security 

 environments.  In turn those criminal groups undermine stability of countries in 

 our region. 

 

 It is an understatement to say that counter narcotics strategies are vitally 

 important for our regional security. 

 

 In that context I have now visited the JIATF-West on two separate occasions. 

 The mission of JIATF-W is to conduct activities to detect, disrupt and 

 dismantle drug related translational threats in Asia and the Pacific. 

 

 The reference to Interagency includes; the US Navy, Navy Reserve, FBI, 

 United States Coast Guard, United States Army, United States Air Force, 

 United States Air Force Reserve, United States Marines, United States 

 Marine Reserves. 

 

 In short JIATF-W has access to and co-ordinates the activities of the all of 

 substantial United States military, policing and intelligence agencies. 

 

 The goals of JAITF-W are to: 

 â¢ Reduce drug flow throughout South East Asia and the Pacific; 

  12

 â¢ Disrupt and dismantle major drug trafficking organizations; 

 â¢ Strengthen the law enforcement institutions of partner nations 

 threatened by illegal drugs; and 

 â¢ Reduce support the drug trafficking provides to terrorist organizations; 

 

 JAITF-W operates a number of counter-narcotics missions, and training and 

 infrastructure programmes with a number of regional partners including the 

 Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Vietnam. 

 

 Given the agencies involved and the tremendous importance of the work of 

 JIATF-W, I was therefore very disappointed to learn that a representative of 

 the Australian Federal Police has not been posted to the Agency. I was 

 informed that an AFP Representative would be most welcome. I do 

 understand however that a representative of the Australian Customs Service 

 will be based with JIATF-W later this year. 

 

 By working more closely with the JIATF-W we are more likely to overcome our 

 joint challenges including:  

 â¢ Transforming organisational structures that hinder cooperation; 

 â¢ Overcoming competition and distrust amongst agencies; and 

 â¢ Eliminating cracks and seams that provide safe haven for international 

 criminal syndicates. 

 

 Labor is determined to support the important role of JIATF-W and will 

 permanently place an AFP representative to assist the work of the Agency.  A 

 permanent AFP representative will facilitate even closer co-ordination with the 

 work of the Agency and Australian law enforcement Agencies. 

 

 East-West Centre  

 

 The East West Centre was created by the United States Congress to: 

 

  13

 ”To contribute to a peaceful, prosperous and just Asia Pacific 

 community by serving as a vigorous hub for cooperative research, 

 education, and dialogue on critical issues of common concern the Asia 

 Pacific region.” 

 

 The East West Centre plays an important role in strengthening regional 

 cooperation by advising, promoting and supporting regional institutions - 

 government and non-government.  It offers a number of general and specialist 

 education programmes as well as providing a number of scholarships to 

 potential leaders in the Asia Pacific region. 

 

 The East West Centre also engages in conflict management and mediation.  

 The Centre provides training and fellowship opportunities, and works to 

 improve understanding of the origins and course of conflicts and the means to 

 avoid, manage, and peacefully resolve them. 

 

 The Asia Pacific Leadership Program operates by inviting young leaders and 

 potential leaders from the Asia Pacific region to undertake course work at the 

 Centre.  The course work includes a leadership program that focuses on 

 instructing students as to how to build networks within their own communities 

 to maximize their effectiveness. 

 

 The East West Centre also undertakes a number of exchanges and 

 conferences including regular seminars including for overseas journalists. 

 

 Asia-Pacific Centre for Security Studies 

 

 The Asia Pacific Centre for Security Studies was established as a US 

 Department of Defense Regional Study, Conference and Research Centre. 

 Despite its close connection with the United States military I have sat in on 

 round table discussions indicating that staff members had complete academic 

 freedom and did not hesitate to contribute a wide range of views.  

 

  14

 The Centre has the goal of developing cooperative strategy and maintaining a 

 positive security relationship with nations from the Asia Pacific region.  

 

 The focus of the Centre is on academic non-war fighting analysis, discussion 

 and training.  Forty-five Asia Pacific regional governments have been - and 

 continue to be - involved in the programs of the Centre. 

 

 Programmes of the APCSS focus on the inter-relationship between military, 

 economic, political and diplomatic policies and participants relevant to 

 regional security issues.   

 

 The Centre also undertakes a number of regional events and has been able 

 to conduct roundtable workshops to find solutions to complex issues including 

 in some circumstances recommending restructuring of government agencies. 

 I was advised that a number of countries have acted in whole or in part on 

 recommendations of the APCSS. 

 

 Again it was suggested to me that an Australian would be most welcome as a 

 permanent member of staff.  It was suggested that not only would that person 

 be able to provide particular expertise from Australia’s perspective but would 

 also share in the expertise contributed by other countries.  It was also 

 suggested that that person would have an excellent opportunity to develop 

 networks with senior representatives of other countries who have and will 

 continue to have a vital role in security in our region.  

 

 Again, Labor will provide a permanent military staff officer to the APCSS to 

 work more closely with the United States in the important work of security 

 capacity building in our region. 

 

 Global Peace Operations Initiative  

 

 Another very positive influence in the region is the Global Peace Operations 

 Initiative. The issue was discussed at length during my visit to US Pacific 

 Command and indeed during meetings in Washington.  

  15

 

 The Global Peace Operations Initiative includes a fund established by the 

 United States Congress to assist in the training of peace keepers around the 

 globe. The initiative aims to develop the capacity of various militaries around 

 the world to undertake peace keeping and stability operations.19   

 

 The ADF Liaison Officer with the US State Department recently submitted to 

 the United States Department of State that more advanced militaries such as 

 Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore and others would be able to 

 significantly value add to the program by offering their expertise to train 

 militaries in other less resourced nations. 

 

 The Global Peace Operations Initiative unquestionably has significant 

 potential benefit for Australia and our region. 

 

 Conclusion 

 

 It is clear that the US plays a vital role in the Asia Pacific. The examples I 

 have given demonstrate the extensive commitment that our American friends 

 have to our region.  

 

 In this century, which some refer to as the ‘Asian Century’, is vital that we  

 work closely with the United States to ensure strong institutions and 

 frameworks to face our mutual challenges. These challenges include 

 managing the economic and military rise of both China and India, the 

 challenges of fragile and failing states, and the fight against international 

 terrorism. 

 

 I have previously put forward the idea of an Asia Pacific Centre for Civil-Military Cooperation which would work to develop joint doctrine and training 

 between Australian Government departments, NGOs and the private sector. It 

 would also provide an opportunity for participants from regional partners to 

 learn governance skills and become a hub for academic discussion and policy 

 development.  

  16

 

 This Centre would work closely with the United States agencies and institutes 

 that I have referred to. Jointly we would work to partner institutions in the Asia 

 Pacific region to enhance the sold network of governance and peace building 

 training across our region. Indeed, the Australian Centre would also be a 

 welcome addition to the infrastructure needed for our effective contribution to 

 the Global Peace Operations Initiative.  

 

 I have also announced that a Labor Government will take a proposal to the 

 next Trilateral Strategic Dialogue with our Japanese and American partners to 

 commission a Trilateral Climate Change and National Security Assessment. 

 

 The Assessment would identify the major regional security threats raised by 

 global warming. Security agencies from all three countries would participate 

 and the initiative would involve close consultation with countries in the region 

 most exposed to the security risks of global warming. 

 

 Labor is committed to working more closely with those United States 

 institutions that are vital to our region. This will include permanently basing a 

 permanent AFP representative to help the JIATF-W fight the narcotics trade: a 

 trade that funds terrorist organisations in our region.  Labor will also include 

 placing a permanent military staff officer with the APCSS. 

 

 Far from downgrading the Australia-United States alliance a future Labor 

 Government will work more closely with the United States in the vitally 

 important work that they do in our region.  

 

 By doing so we will add greater value to achieving our combined objectives.
