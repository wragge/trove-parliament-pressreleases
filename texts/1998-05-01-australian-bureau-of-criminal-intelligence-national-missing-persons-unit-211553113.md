  Improved Procedures for Finding Australians Missing Overseas

  

  A new approach to locating Australians  who go missing overseas 
has been developed to help simplify investigation procedures, better 
coordinate authorities and provide greater support to missing persons' 
families and friends.

  

 The Australian Bureau 
of Criminal Intelligence’s National Missing Persons Unit (NMPU) has 
been instrumental in developing the new procedures in conjunction with 
the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and the Australian 
Federal Police (AFP).

  

 To mark the initiative, 
a brochure outlining the new procedures and advice for the families 
of people who are missing overseas will be launched at   11am on Monday 4 May in the Treaties Room, ground floor, DFAT.

  

 Director of the Australian 
Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, Mr John Ure, said the new procedures 
will ensure that both government and non-government resources are available 
to help resolve cases involving Australians who go missing overseas.

  

 “The National Missing 
Persons Unit, DFAT and the AFP have combined their expertise to ensure 
there is a more efficient, united and streamlined approach to dealing 
with this particularly complex area of missing persons investigation,” 
Mr Ure explained.

  

 “The resources of 
all agencies involved in the search for missing people, including the 
Red Cross, Salvation Army and International Social Service, will, where 
necessary, be available to locate a person and determine if they are 
safe and well.”

  

 As part of the new 
investigation procedures, each agency will have specific duties:

  

  Department of  Foreign Affairs and Trade

 Will be responsible 
for conducting preliminary inquiries to determine that there are genuine 
concerns for the safety and welfare of the person reported missing. 
DFAT will also contact Australian diplomatic missions where consular 
staff will begin inquiries with the local authorities.

  

  Australian Federal Police

 The Australian Federal 
Police National Response Centre will coordinate police investigations, 
both here and overseas. AFP will be responsible for helping the family 
or friends of the missing person complete a missing persons report that 
will provide investigators with the necessary information to start a 
search.

  

  National Missing Persons Unit :

 Will provide support 
services to all agencies involved in an investigation..

 These services will 
include promoting cases via the Internet and, where necessary, contacting 
non-government agencies such as the Australian Red Cross International 
Tracing and Refugee Services, the Salvation Army Family Tracing Service 
and the International Social Service for assistance.

  

 Head of Consular Services 
at DFAT, Mr John Oliver, said during 1996-1997, 1200 Australian citizens 
were reported missing overseas. There are currently 18 cases that remain 
unresolved.

  

 “Anyone planning 
to travel overseas should always assess the safety risks of the country 
or region they intend to visit,” Mr Oliver advised. “If, for work 
reasons, a person has to travel to a country where there is military, 
political or civil unrest they should take every precaution to ensure 
their personal safety and welfare. Going into such areas can be dangerous 
for tourists and they should seek DFAT’s advice before doing so.”

  

 Director of AFP’s 
International Division, Federal Agent David Schramm, reinforced the 
importance of staying in contact with family, friends or business colleagues 
when travelling abroad.

  

 “Leaving a detailed 
itinerary with someone at home and keeping in regular contact with family 
and friends should be part of any travel arrangements,” he said.

  

 “The missing person’s 
last contact, proposed destination, and identity of travelling companions 
are just some of the details investigators will need to start a comprehensive 
search.”

  

  Anyone with   genuine  concerns for the safety and welfare of an Australian 
citizen overseas, should contact the Consular Operations Section of 
the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on 1300 555 135 from anywhere 
in Australia for the cost of a local call.
