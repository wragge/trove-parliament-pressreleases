 Combating People Smugglers And Strengthening Australia's Border Protection Kim Beazley - Leader of the Opposition

 Media Statement - 16 October 2001

 Labor will put in place a real plan to combat people smugglers and strengthen our maritime border protection. Australians want long-term solutions which last and work - and which stop the boats carrying illegal immigrants coming.

 Only Labor has a real plan to try to protect Australia from the tide of illegal immigrants. This is based on two key planks:

 An Australian Coast Guard. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» A comprehensive plan to crack down on the people smugglers and send the illegal immigrants back to Indonesia for proper refugee processing by the United Nations. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Record numbers of illegal immigrants have come to Australia under the Howard Government. In the past ten years, 13,500 illegal immigrants have arrived - but of these 11,000 have arrived during the term of the Howard Government.

 In the last three years, in particular, there has been a substantial increase. John Howard only chose to act after the skyrocketing arrivals under his Government - and then on the eve of an election. MV Tampa was the 213th boat to arrive on his watch.

 Labor doesn't oppose doing something about this problem. But what's John Howard's solution? To throw millions of dollars at the problem to get through the election and gain perceived political advantage. He is deploying a significant proportion of the Navy to the north at great expense, when it should be preparing for its true role of war-fighting at this time of international crisis. He is spending millions of dollars to pay Nauru and Papua New Guinea and who-knows wherever else to take illegal immigrants and process them.

 John Howard's policy is ad hoc. It is temporary. It is not a long-term solution. It is tricky because it won't last beyond the election. John Howard may say, "at least I'm having a go". But the boats keep coming,

 one after another.

 There has to be a better way to achieve the same objectives - and there is. The details of Labor's initiatives are included in the attachment to this press release.

 The Coast Guard will be on the beat every day of the year - not just before an election. Labor first announced this initiative in January 2000 and in detail on 6 October 2001 as part of Labor's National Security policy. Further details are provided in the attachment to this press release.

 Today's announcement focuses on the other arm of this strategy. Australia can only stop the flood of boats by fixing our relationship with Indonesia. A real solution must be found in Jakarta. It won't be found in Nauru or PNG or our other Pacific neighbours.

 Labor will pursue the issue of people smuggling with the highest levels of the Indonesian Government.

 Within 10 days of Labor forming a new Government, I will send the new Foreign Minister and other Ministers to Jakarta for intensive discussions with the Indonesia Government on a plan for proper refugee processing. And I will make Jakarta my first overseas destination as Prime Minister. I will work with the Indonesian President to put in place a real solution to this problem.

 Australia needs to have a good relationship with Indonesia. We are neighbours in democracy as well as neighbours in geography. I'm committed to a good relationship. It is in our national interest. Equally, I am sure Indonesia understands that fixing the problem of people smuggling in a joint way is vital to building a new, whole-hearted and cooperative relationship.

 Moreover, it is in Indonesia's interests to pursue the people smugglers because they are invariably involved in other organised criminal activities in that country, bringing suffering to communities in Indonesia.

 Of course, not all of our interests and views are ever going to coincide identically. I have no doubt that Australia as an ally of the United States and Indonesia as the world's largest Muslim nation will have a different view of the methods to be pursued in the fight against global terrorism, without differing in our fundamental opposition to mass terror as a weapon.

 This doesn't mean we cannot advance common interests which relate to our neighbourhood. That is why we can and should get on with the fight against the people smugglers.

 Labor will pursue a comprehensive bilateral agreement to extend cooperation against people smuggling. We will press for Indonesian agreement to accept the return of vessels and people who are trying to use Indonesian territory as a jumping off point to illegally enter Australia. At the same time Australia must be prepared to do more to assist Indonesia deal with this national security, law enforcement and humanitarian challenge.

 Labor will offer more support to Indonesia to crack down on the people smuggling networks in that country. Labor will provide increased support to the UN agency which processes refugees in the Indonesian camps. We'll accept our fair share of genuine refugees within John Howard's overall refugee programme - but not one more. And we'll tackle the problem regionally with all the countries which are used as transit points for the movement of asylum seekers and illegal migrants to Australia. Without the active cooperation of these countries, boatloads of illegal immigrants will continue to head for Australia's shores.

 Labor in the past put such plans in place to deal with the problems of refugees from the end of the Vietnam War (known as the Comprehensive Plan of Action) and refugees from China in the 1990s. These plans worked, they were orderly, they were cost-effective. We've done it before and we will do it again.

 Labor's approach will cost a lot less than the huge sum John Howard is currently spending.

 We cannot afford to ignore this problem, or skate through from one election to the next. Uncontrolled migration and movements of refugees have increased dramatically over the past decade. This is a global problem, and it's growing. It is estimated that there are some 23 million displaced persons seeking refuge globally.

 A wide range of factors are responsible including regional conflicts, persecution of minorities and civil unrest, rising levels of poverty and environmental degradation in source countries. These problems are increasing. The numbers of displaced people are likely to grow further as a consequence of a global economic downturn and the likelihood of protracted conflict and unrest in regions such as the Middle East and South Asia. We have to anticipate these long-term trends with long-term plans.

 People smuggling is a highly lucrative and relatively low-risk endeavour for transnational criminal networks. People smuggling networks are likely to be linked with other aspects of international crime including drug trafficking, money laundering, fraud, illicit arms shipments and official corruption. These networks have to be taken on and destroyed.

 Labor supports the overall aim of the Government in stemming the flow of illegal immigrants. But it is the detail of how it is going about that aim which raises concerns.

 Australia needs a plan to combat people smugglers and to strengthen our borders - a real plan which works over the long-term, not a plan for the election.

 Combating People Smugglers And Strengthening Australia's Border Protection: Labor's Initiatives

 Establishing a Coast Guard

 As announced as part of Labor's National Security policy on 6 October, Labor will establish the Australian Coast Guard, on station 52 weeks a year, to act as a maritime police force and a coastal defence force in times of war or national emergency. Labor will spend more than $895 million over four years on the Coast Guard. That involves consolidating the disparate coastal surveillance arrangements which currently exist into one powerful agency and one central budget.

 This powerful new agency will allow the Navy to be used for its real purpose of naval operations. That is what the Navy is trained and equipped for.

 In peacetime, the Coast Guard will be vital in deterring people smugglers in a sustainable and cost-effective way. In addition to tackling people smuggling, the Coast Guard will counter quarantine breaches, illegal fishing, drugs and arms smuggling, search and rescue, and covert landings on our coastline.

 To ensure comprehensive coverage of our maritime approaches, Labor will ensure that the Coast Guard is fully integrated into our national intelligence and surveillance network so that we have a better national picture of our sea borders, drawn from all of our sensors and systems. In particular, Labor will ensure that the new Defence Headquarters (Australian Theatre) and other key defence headquarters develop close intelligence and surveillance links with the new Coast Guard, and exchange data on a comprehensive and real-time basis.

 The Coast Guard will come within the new portfolio of Home Affairs. In times of war or declared emergency, the Coast Guard will transfer to the Department of Defence and come under military command, acting as the fourth arm of the Australian Defence Force (ADF). This arrangement is tried and tested overseas, as in the United States where the US Coast Guard is an agency of the Department of Transportation in peacetime, but is transferred to the Department of the Navy in wartime.

 There will be a very close relationship between the Coast Guard and the Navy. Coast Guard personnel will be trained to enable their ready transfer to military operations. In peacetime, there will be extensive cross-postings between the Navy and the Coast Guard to provide military operational training for Coast Guard personnel, and basic command, seamanship and navigational training for Navy personnel.

 In this way, the Coast Guard will free the Navy to get on with its core task of training and preparing for the military defence of Australia and undertaking military operations. The Navy's warships are designed and equipped for war fighting. Their crews are trained for that role, not as maritime police intercepting rickety old wooden boats. Using the Navy for basic, on-going policing is expensive and unnecessary.

 In peacetime, the Coast Guard patrol boat force will undertake the national coastal surveillance and response function, combining the existing military and civil maritime protection assets. In wartime or declared defence emergency, the Coast Guard will beef up the Navy. Under Defence command, the Coast Guard patrol boat force will assist the ADF in coastal and inshore defence operations, port security and operations in support of sea-borne special forces and regional surveillance units. In this way, Coast Guard units will be a military auxiliary to the Navy and the ADF in general. Far from taking away from the Navy's resources, a Coast Guard configured along these lines will enhance Navy resources.

 As previously announced, the Coast Guard's patrol boat force will be based on the existing capital acquisition budget for the replacement Fremantle-class patrol boat. These Patrol Boats are almost 25 years old and are nearing the end of their working life. This project presents a unique opportunity to purchase a fleet of purpose-built Coast Guard patrol boats. It will allow for a significant upgrading of our coastal patrol fleet within the current acquisition budget, due to the civil police standards to which these vessels will be built.

 Finally, Labor's Coast Guard initiatives will not affect the level of resources recently announced for Customs and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service in relation to border security measures at airports, for air cargo, at seaports (including sea cargo containers), at mail exchanges and for enhanced quarantine public awareness programmes.

 Cost: Previously announced.

 Joint Action by Australia and Indonesia

 Labor will pursue the issue of people smuggling with the highest levels of the Indonesian Government.

 We will do so in the context of our wholehearted commitment to build a new mutually beneficial relationship with the new Indonesia.

 Within 10 days of the formation of a Labor Government, the new Foreign Minister and other Ministers will travel to Jakarta for discussions with the Indonesian Government. This will be necessary preparation for a visit to Jakarta by the new Prime Minister very early in the life of a new Government.

 Labor will pursue a comprehensive agreement with Indonesia to extend bilateral cooperation against people smuggling. We will press for Indonesian agreement to accept the return of vessels and people who are trying to use Indonesian territory as a jumping off point to illegally enter Australia. At the same time we must be prepared to do much more to assist Indonesia deal with this national security, law enforcement and humanitarian challenge.

 Labor will provide increased technical support for Indonesian law enforcement authorities to disrupt people-smuggling operations and other transnational criminal activity including drug and arms smuggling. We will also provide additional assistance to Indonesia in the area of maritime surveillance. This will enhance the security of both Indonesia and Australia. Joint action by Australia and Indonesia to crack down on illegal people smuggling and other transnational criminal activities is in our common interest.

 Cost: Additional technical support for Indonesian law enforcement and maritime surveillance will be $10 million over 4 years.

 Support for UN High Commissioner for Refugees Operations in Indonesia

 For our part, Australia must put a greater effort into encouraging the international community to find homes for those people in Indonesia who have been assessed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to be genuine refugees. We'll accept our fair share of genuine refugees within John Howard's overall refugee programme.

 Any long-term solution to the problems of people smuggling also depends, in part, on assisting other countries to overcome their serious economic and social problems. As part of Australia's overseas development programs, Labor will make targeted aid contributions and settlement support to countries of first asylum. This will help reduce the number of people who illegally make their way to Australia.

 Labor will further increase Australia's humanitarian contributions to assist the UNHCR in processing the claims of Afghani, Iraqi and other nationals in Indonesia.

 Cost: Increased support for UNHCR refugee processing in Indonesia will be $11 million over 4 years.

 Building a Framework for Regional Cooperation to Combat People Smuggling

 Efforts to combat people smuggling must be pursued on a regional basis. Labor will appoint a Special Australian Representative to promote regional action against people smugglers issues. The appointment of a senior Australian official to this full-time role, together with the establishment of an anti-people smuggling unit within the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio, will provide a strong focus for Australia's efforts to improve regional cooperation.

 Labor will put the issue of people smuggling firmly on the agenda in Australia's regional security

 dialogues - bilaterally and at the ASEAN Regional Security Forum (ARF). The ARF has in recent years expanded the scope of its dialogue to cover transnational crime issues including drug trafficking, arms smuggling and piracy. Greater attention must be given to people-smuggling and refugee issues with the involvement of relevant experts across the region.

 The Special Representative will explore the potential for convening a regional summit focussed on the question of combating people smugglers. A regional summit involving heads of government, foreign ministers, and ministers responsible for immigration and law enforcement, together with UNHCR, other UN agencies and relevant experts would provide a valuable forum to develop a comprehensive framework for cooperation against people smugglers.

 Indonesian support for such a conference would be very important. Australia should be prepared to fund such a conference and related meetings of technical experts in 2002-2003.

 Cost: Funding for the Special Representative and the anti-people smuggling unit will be $3.5 million over 4 years. Funding for a Regional Summit on People Smuggling will be $1 million in 2002-2003 (including preparatory work).

 Strengthened Diplomatic Presence in the Middle East and South Asia

 Timely action against people smuggling requires both an improved national capacity to assess relevant developments in distant regions where Australia's diplomatic representation is limited, and effective intelligence collection, especially in relation to clandestine people smuggling networks.

 A Labor Government will improve the capacity of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Immigration and other agencies, to assess developments overseas relevant to the unauthorised movement of people to Australia. This will be supported by the allocation of additional resources to Australian diplomatic posts in the Middle East and South Asia.

 Cost: Additional funding for a strengthened diplomatic presence in the Middle East and South Asia will be $5 million over 4 years.

 Enhanced Intelligence Operations Against People Smuggling Networks

 Labor will boost the capacity of Australia's intelligence agencies to collect and assess intelligence relating to clandestine people smuggling networks. Labor will further employ relevant agencies under the provisions of the Intelligence Services Act 2001 to undertake operations which actively disrupt people smuggling networks. Further details will not be disclosed on the grounds of national security.

 Cost: Increased intelligence funding will be $5 million over 4 years.

 Strengthened Immigration Security Checking

 As part our comprehensive strategy to combat people smuggling, Labor will introduce a range of measures to strengthen Australia's vigilance and illegal immigration detection capabilities in overseas posts, and especially in targeted countries.

 As announced in Labor's National Security policy on 6 October, Labor will strengthen the checking of visa applications and review visa regulations and criteria for excluding persons with known or suspected

 criminal records. Immigration data and warning notifications will be more stringently crosschecked with security and criminal intelligence information.

 To deal with the problem of illegal immigration and related national security and law enforcement issues, including drug trafficking and terrorism, Labor will enhance the effectiveness of Australia's border controls by:

 Placing additional immigration compliance officers in selected overseas immigration posts to combat document and identity fraud - this measure will expand particularly Australia's network of compliance officers in the Middle East and Asia;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Expanding the Immigration Department's airport liaison capacity in strategic airports that act as gateways to Australia; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Providing technical assistance to local airport officers in targeted countries so that they can better detect forged documents. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Cost: Previously announced.

 Enhanced Police Cooperation Against People Smuggling Networks

 In combating the transnational criminal groups who orchestrate people smuggling operations, Labor will ensure that federal law enforcement agencies have the capacity to engage globally and play a significant role in enhancing law enforcement cooperation in our region.

 The most successful approach in combating transnational criminal networks such as those involved in people smuggling is to target the high level members of groups, with the aim of disrupting and dismantling the overall operation. Since operations work across national borders, this approach requires international and regional coordination between law enforcement agencies.

 International law enforcement cooperation is essential to combat people smuggling. More active engagement in international policing networks will give Australia greater opportunities to develop compatible laws and formal arrangements for information exchange with other countries.

 Labor will substantially increase the Australian Federal Police Law Enforcement Cooperation Program to carry out international criminal intelligence gathering and policing initiatives. Currently, 33 AFP Agents are stationed in 21 countries, as part of the Law Enforcement Cooperation Program. This includes one officer in Jakarta, one temporary position in Kuala Lumpur and one position in Islamabad with an emphasis on people smuggling issues.

 Under Labor, extra AFP liaison officers will be stationed in regions where there are significant source countries for people smugglers. As ninety percent of unauthorised arrivals using people smugglers during the last two years have come from Iraq and Afghanistan, particular attention will be paid to increasing AFP presence in the Middle East.

 Labor will also increase funding for cooperation with regional police. The AFP will be able to build upon the existing 5 task forces which it has set up with Indonesia.

 Cost: Previously announced.

 International Legal Cooperation Against People Smuggling

 Efforts to combat people smuggling will also be supported by an active Australian approach to international legal cooperation. Labor will ratify the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime, and will sign and ratify the Protocols.

 Australia is a signatory to the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime, but the Howard Government has not ratified the Treaty. Nor has it signed the two Protocols to the Convention: the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants, which deals with the problem of organised criminal groups involved in people smuggling; and the Protocol against Trafficking in Persons, dealing with organised criminal slavery.

 Labor will take a leading role in developing an international approach under the Convention to mutual legal assistance, extradition, law-enforcement cooperation, technical assistance and training, so that State Parties will be able to rely on one another in investigating, prosecuting and punishing crimes committed by transnational organised criminal groups.

 Currently, even if there is sufficient evidence for the AFP to issue an Australian arrest warrant against organisers overseas, there are often difficulties extraditing these individuals to Australia for prosecution. One of these difficulties is that mutual assistance and extradition procedures only apply where both countries involved have corresponding domestic offences. Labor will encourage other countries to enact their own domestic laws against people smuggling, terrorism and other serious criminal activity.

 Border Protection Legislation

 Finally, there has been much debate about the border protection laws of this nation. Labor's position on this issue has been clear and consistent. Yesterday (Monday 15 October), in order to fulfil the commitment I made during the Leaders' Debate on Sunday 14 October, I published on the ALP web site both versions of the Border Protection Bill and my parliamentary speeches on the Bills.

 Labor supports strong border protection legislation. If elected, Labor will retain the Border Protection Bill in the form that was passed by Parliament this year. Labor supported that Bill in the national interest, and we will retain it in the national interest.

 Here is the summary of the facts surrounding the first and second Border Protection Bills.

 The Government's first Border Protection Bill 2001 was introduced by the Government into the House of Representatives at 6.40 p.m. on Wednesday 29 August 2001. Labor supported the purpose of the Bill - to provide for the proper protection of Australia's borders. But Labor couldn't support the Bill itself, as first drafted, because it was rushed and it contained a lot of mistakes.

 For example, there was no requirement in the first Bill that powers could only be used against boats that had entered Australian waters unlawfully. As drafted, the bill would have allowed government officials to board boats competing in the Sydney to Hobart yacht race and tow them into international waters. It would even have allowed government officials to tow ordinary Australians on pleasure craft out to sea -without any legal recourse. The first Bill would not have prevented people from being returned to sinking boats.

 It also contained unprecedented immunity provisions - wider even than those applying to federal police in the line of duty and members of our defence forces responding in terrorist emergency situations. What's more, the original Bill operated "in spite of any other law" - setting aside the usual protections offered by Australia's criminal and civil laws.

 Even the government's Chief Legal Officer, Attorney-General Daryl Williams, later admitted that the Bill would have to be read subject to the Constitution - in other words, it might not have worked because it might have been unlawful.

 Right from the start, Labor refused to be rushed into the passage of bad law. Labor understood that its decision not to pass the law would be unpopular - but it was a decision that was taken in the national interest.

 Two weeks later, the Government came back with a second Bill. The new Bill was called the Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001. The new Border Protection Bill was similar to the original Bill in name alone. The Government had ridiculed Labor's opposition to the original Bill. But the new Bill picked up every single one of Labor's objections.

 The new Bill contained specific provisions to authorise the action that was taken with respect to the Tampa, as called for by Labor. Rather than setting aside all other laws, the new Bill built on the existing well-established legal framework for the treatment of vessels established in the Customs Act and Migration Act. The new Bill contained a specific provision that people could only be returned to a ship if it was safe to do so. The new Bill contained clear protection for officers acting with authority. The protection was the same given to Commonwealth officers in other security roles. And the new Bill preserved the power of the High Court to review government action - as required by our Constitution.

 Labor stood firm on its objections to the original Bill because we won't pass bad law. But Labor agreed to pass the new Bill when it fixed all of the problems in the original Bill. Labor's position on border protection legislation was consistent and principled, right from day one. If anyone changed positions on the Bill, it was the Government.

 Finally, Labor's Coast Guard initiatives will not affect the level of resources recently announced for Customs and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service in relation to border security measures at airports, for air cargo, at seaports (including sea cargo containers), at mail exchanges and for enhanced quarantine public awareness programmes.

 Cost: Previously announced.

 Joint Action by Australia and Indonesia

 Labor will pursue the issue of people smuggling with the highest levels of the Indonesian Government. We will do so in the context of our wholehearted commitment to build a new mutually beneficial relationship with the new Indonesia.

 Within 10 days of the formation of a Labor Government, the new Foreign Minister and other Ministers will travel to Jakarta for discussions with the Indonesian Government. This will be necessary preparation for a visit to Jakarta by the new Prime Minister very early in the life of a new Government.

 Labor will pursue a comprehensive agreement with Indonesia to extend bilateral cooperation against people smuggling. We will press for Indonesian agreement to accept the return of vessels and people who are trying to use Indonesian territory as a jumping off point to illegally enter Australia. At the same time we must be prepared to do much more to assist Indonesia deal with this national security, law enforcement and humanitarian challenge.

 Labor will provide increased technical support for Indonesian law enforcement authorities to disrupt people-smuggling operations and other transnational criminal activity including drug and arms smuggling. We will also provide additional assistance to Indonesia in the area of maritime surveillance. This will enhance the security of both Indonesia and Australia. Joint action by Australia and Indonesia to crack down on illegal people smuggling and other transnational criminal activities is in our common interest.

 Cost: Additional technical support for Indonesian law enforcement and maritime surveillance will be $10 million over 4 years.

 Support for UN High Commissioner for Refugees Operations in Indonesia

 For our part, Australia must put a greater effort into encouraging the international community to find homes for those people in Indonesia who have been assessed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to be genuine refugees. We'll accept our fair share of genuine refugees within John Howard's overall refugee programme.

 Any long-term solution to the problems of people smuggling also depends, in part, on assisting other countries to overcome their serious economic and social problems. As part of Australia's overseas development programs, Labor will make targeted aid contributions and settlement support to countries of first asylum. This will help reduce the number of people who illegally make their way to Australia.

 Labor will further increase Australia's humanitarian contributions to assist the UNHCR in processing the claims of Afghani, Iraqi and other nationals in Indonesia.

 Cost: Increased support for UNHCR refugee processing in Indonesia will be $11 million over 4 years.

 Building a Framework for Regional Cooperation to Combat People Smuggling

 Efforts to combat people smuggling must be pursued on a regional basis. Labor will appoint a Special Australian Representative to promote regional action against people smugglers issues. The appointment of a senior Australian official to this full-time role, together with the establishment of an anti-people smuggling unit within the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio, will provide a strong focus for Australia's efforts to improve regional cooperation.

 Labor will put the issue of people smuggling firmly on the agenda in Australia's regional security dialogues - bilaterally and at the ASEAN Regional Security Forum (ARF). The ARF has in recent years expanded the scope of its dialogue to cover transnational crime issues including drug trafficking, arms smuggling and piracy. Greater attention must be given to people-smuggling and refugee issues with the involvement of relevant experts across the region.

 The Special Representative will explore the potential for convening a regional summit focussed on the question of combating people smugglers. A regional summit involving heads of government, foreign ministers, and ministers responsible for immigration and law enforcement, together with UNHCR, other UN agencies and relevant experts would provide a valuable forum to develop a comprehensive framework for cooperation against people smugglers.

 Indonesian support for such a conference would be very important. Australia should be prepared to fund such a conference and related meetings of technical experts in 2002-2003.

 Cost: Funding for the Special Representative and the anti-people smuggling unit will be $3.5 million over 4 years. Funding for a Regional Summit on People Smuggling will be $1 million in 2002-2003 (including preparatory work).

 Strengthened Diplomatic Presence in the Middle East and South Asia

 Timely action against people smuggling requires both an improved national capacity to assess relevant developments in distant regions where Australia's diplomatic representation is limited, and effective intelligence collection, especially in relation to clandestine people smuggling networks.

 A Labor Government will improve the capacity of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Immigration and other agencies, to assess developments overseas relevant to the unauthorised movement of people to Australia. This will be supported by the allocation of additional resources to Australian diplomatic posts in the Middle East and South Asia.

 Cost: Additional funding for a strengthened diplomatic presence in the Middle East and South Asia will be $5 million over 4 years.

 Enhanced Intelligence Operations Against People Smuggling Networks

 Labor will boost the capacity of Australia's intelligence agencies to collect and assess intelligence relating to clandestine people smuggling networks. Labor will further employ relevant agencies under the provisions of the Intelligence Services Act 2001 to undertake operations which actively disrupt people smuggling networks. Further details will not be disclosed on the grounds of national security.

 Cost: Increased intelligence funding will be $5 million over 4 years.

 Strengthened Immigration Security Checking

 As part our comprehensive strategy to combat people smuggling, Labor will introduce a range of measures to strengthen Australia's vigilance and illegal immigration detection capabilities in overseas posts, and especially in targeted countries.

 As announced in Labor's National Security policy on 6 October, Labor will strengthen the checking of visa applications and review visa regulations and criteria for excluding persons with known or suspected criminal records. Immigration data and warning notifications will be more stringently crosschecked with security and criminal intelligence information.

 To deal with the problem of illegal immigration and related national security and law enforcement issues, including drug trafficking and terrorism, Labor will enhance the effectiveness of Australia's border controls by:

 Placing additional immigration compliance officers in selected overseas immigration posts to combat document and identity fraud - this measure will expand particularly Australia's network of compliance officers in the Middle East and Asia;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Expanding the Immigration Department's airport liaison capacity in strategic airports that act as gateways to Australia; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Providing technical assistance to local airport officers in targeted countries so that they can better detect forged documents. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Cost: Previously announced.

 Enhanced Police Cooperation Against People Smuggling Networks

 In combating the transnational criminal groups who orchestrate people smuggling operations, Labor will ensure that federal law enforcement agencies have the capacity to engage globally and play a significant role in enhancing law enforcement cooperation in our region.

 The most successful approach in combating transnational criminal networks such as those involved in people smuggling is to target the high level members of groups, with the aim of disrupting and dismantling the overall operation. Since operations work across national borders, this approach requires international and regional coordination between law enforcement agencies.

 International law enforcement cooperation is essential to combat people smuggling. More active engagement in international policing networks will give Australia greater opportunities to develop compatible laws and formal arrangements for information exchange with other countries.

 Labor will substantially increase the Australian Federal Police Law Enforcement Cooperation Program to carry out international criminal intelligence gathering and policing initiatives. Currently, 33 AFP Agents are stationed in 21 countries, as part of the Law Enforcement Cooperation Program. This includes one officer in Jakarta, one temporary position in Kuala Lumpur and one position in Islamabad with an emphasis on people smuggling issues.

 Under Labor, extra AFP liaison officers will be stationed in regions where there are significant source countries for people smugglers. As ninety percent of unauthorised arrivals using people smugglers during the last two years have come from Iraq and Afghanistan, particular attention will be paid to increasing AFP presence in the Middle East.

 Labor will also increase funding for cooperation with regional police. The AFP will be able to build upon the existing 5 task forces which it has set up with Indonesia.

 Cost: Previously announced.

 International Legal Cooperation Against People Smuggling

 Efforts to combat people smuggling will also be supported by an active Australian approach to international legal cooperation. Labor will ratify the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime, and will sign and ratify the Protocols.

 Australia is a signatory to the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime, but the Howard Government has not ratified the Treaty. Nor has it signed the two Protocols to the Convention: the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants, which deals with the problem of organised criminal groups involved in people smuggling; and the Protocol against Trafficking in Persons, dealing with organised criminal slavery.

 Labor will take a leading role in developing an international approach under the Convention to mutual legal assistance, extradition, law-enforcement cooperation, technical assistance and training, so that State Parties will be able to rely on one another in investigating, prosecuting and punishing crimes committed by transnational organised criminal groups.

 Currently, even if there is sufficient evidence for the AFP to issue an Australian arrest warrant against organisers overseas, there are often difficulties extraditing these individuals to Australia for prosecution. One of these difficulties is that mutual assistance and extradition procedures only apply where both countries involved have corresponding domestic offences. Labor will encourage other countries to enact their own domestic laws against people smuggling, terrorism and other serious criminal activity.

 Border Protection Legislation

 Finally, there has been much debate about the border protection laws of this nation. Labor's position on this issue has been clear and consistent. Yesterday (Monday 15 October), in order to fulfil the commitment I made during the Leaders' Debate on Sunday 14 October, I published on the ALP web site both versions of the Border Protection Bill and my parliamentary speeches on the Bills.

 Labor supports strong border protection legislation. If elected, Labor will retain the Border Protection Bill in the form that was passed by Parliament this year. Labor supported that Bill in the national interest, and we will retain it in the national interest.

 Here is the summary of the facts surrounding the first and second Border Protection Bills.

 The Government's first Border Protection Bill 2001 was introduced by the Government into the House of Representatives at 6.40 p.m. on Wednesday 29 August 2001. Labor supported the purpose of the Bill - to provide for the proper protection of Australia's borders. But Labor couldn't support the Bill itself, as first drafted, because it was rushed and it contained a lot of mistakes.

 For example, there was no requirement in the first Bill that powers could only be used against boats that had entered Australian waters unlawfully. As drafted, the bill would have allowed government officials to board boats competing in the Sydney to Hobart yacht race and tow them into international waters. It would even have allowed government officials to tow ordinary Australians on pleasure craft out to sea -without any legal recourse. The first Bill would not have prevented people from being returned to sinking boats.

 It also contained unprecedented immunity provisions - wider even than those applying to federal police in the line of duty and members of our defence forces responding in terrorist emergency situations. What's more, the original Bill operated "in spite of any other law" - setting aside the usual protections offered by Australia's criminal and civil laws.

 Even the government's Chief Legal Officer, Attorney-General Daryl Williams, later admitted that the Bill would have to be read subject to the Constitution - in other words, it might not have worked because it might have been unlawful.

 Right from the start, Labor refused to be rushed into the passage of bad law. Labor understood that its decision not to pass the law would be unpopular - but it was a decision that was taken in the national interest.

 Two weeks later, the Government came back with a second Bill. The new Bill was called the Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Bill 2001. The new Border Protection Bill was similar to the original Bill in name alone. The Government had ridiculed Labor's opposition to the original Bill. But the new Bill picked up every single one of Labor's objections.

 The new Bill contained specific provisions to authorise the action that was taken with respect to the Tampa, as called for by Labor. Rather than setting aside all other laws, the new Bill built on the existing well-established legal framework for the treatment of vessels established in the Customs Act and Migration Act. The new Bill contained a specific provision that people could only be returned to a ship if it was safe to do so. The new Bill contained clear protection for officers acting with authority. The protection was the same given to Commonwealth officers in other security roles. And the new Bill preserved the power of the High Court to review government action - as required by our Constitution.

 Labor stood firm on its objections to the original Bill because we won't pass bad law. But Labor agreed to pass the new Bill when it fixed all of the problems in the original Bill. Labor's position on border protection legislation was consistent and principled, right from day one. If anyone changed positions on the Bill, it was the Government.

 (1) Funding announced in Labor's National Security Policy. The Coast Guard's budget will be composed of all funds currently spent across Commonwealth portfolios on the coastal surveillance and response function (this is estimated to be a minimum of $220 million a year, but government budget papers do not allow for a precise calculation). In addition, Labor will provide $15 million in 2001-02 and 2002-03 to cover start-up administrative and establishment costs. International strategic analysis standards would classify this expenditure as "defence related", as occurs in relation to coast guard expenditure around the world.

 (2) This programme is additional to the secret intelligence measures announced in Labor's National Security Policy. The cost of those related measures was $7 million over 4 years.

 (3) Funding announced in Labor's National Security Policy. The cost of Labor's immigration security measures will be $12.4 million over 4 years.

 (4) Funding announced in Labor's National Security Policy. Additional funding for an increased AFP international capacity will be $14 million over 4 years.
