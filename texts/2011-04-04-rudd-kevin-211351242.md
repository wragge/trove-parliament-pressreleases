 AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT CONDEMNS VIOLENCE IN CÃTE D’IVOIRE   

 

 The Australian Government is gravely concerned about the deteriorating security situation  in CÃ´te d’Ivoire.  

 Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd condemns in the strongest terms all acts of intimidation,  incitement and human rights abuses, and calls for those responsible for acts of violence to  be held accountable for their actions.  

 “The Australian Government is appalled by human rights abuses and recent loss of life in  CÃ´te d’Ivoire. It is imperative that all parties bring an end to this violence,” said Mr Rudd.    

 "The significant loss of life in DuÃ©kouÃ© over recent days is particularly shocking.”  

 The Australian Government strongly supports United Nations Security Council Resolution  1975 of 30 March, calling for all parties to respect the will of the people as expressed  through the election of Alassane Ouattara as President, and imposing travel and financial  sanctions on Laurent Gbagbo and some of his associates.  

 “Laurent Gbagbo needs to step aside immediately,” said Mr Rudd.  

 The Australian Government has provided $2 million to the UNHCR to support Ivorian  refugees in Liberia, and a further $3 million to the United Nations Emergency Humanitarian  Plan in response to the crisis.
