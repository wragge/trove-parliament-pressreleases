 Minister for Development Cooperation · Minister tor Pacific Island Attains  Gordon Bilney MP

 Two RAAF C130 Hercules aircraft loaded with urgently needed relief supplies have arrived in  Kigali in one o f the first aid deliveries to the Rwandan capital.

 Minister for Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney, said the planes landed on schedule  early Sunday evening (Australian time) with over $600,000 worth o f emergency supplies  including:

 â¢ water purification equipment capable o f producing 7500 litres o f clean water per hour â¢  essential medical supplies such as vitamin A and multivitamins, anti-malarial drugs and  antibiotics

 â¢  4 tonnes o f high energy biscuits .

 â¢ nearly 3000 water containers . :

 â¢  rope and rolls o f plastic sheeting to provide immediate shelter â¢ Codan radios to help with food distribution, and ,

 â¢  blankets and solar powered lanterns. â 

 M r Bilney said the bulk o f the supplies landed in Kigali would be used in and around the  capital by UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, to care for the large numbers o f  unaccompanied children.

 The w ater purification equipment will meet an immediate and urgent need for clean water.  This, along with the provision o f health and sanitation facilities, is essential for the safe return  o f refugees and displaced people.

 "The arrival o f these supplies in Kigali is very timely. Australia is one o f the first countries to  airlift relief into the Rwandan capital and the first to arrive with water purification equipment.

 "International relief agencies agree that the key to averting further disaster in Rwanda is  greater concentration o f relief efforts on Kigali in central Rwanda.

 "We want to encourage refugees to return to their homes and reduce the pressure on others to  leave the country", M r Bilney said.
