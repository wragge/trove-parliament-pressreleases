 Government Tackles Illegal Arrivals Head On MPS 047/2000 - Budget Media Release 2

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today announced that a $47.6 million package of measures would be implemented by his portfolio over four years as a part of the Government's campaign to tackle illegal arrivals in Australia head on.

 By boosting Australia's overseas compliance and airport operations, as well as supporting countries of first asylum and helping transit countries combat people smuggling, the Government was taking a holistic approach to a global problem, Mr Ruddock said.

 "The Government is targeting the transit routes of illegal entrants, and supporting the development of technical and physical assistance to border control agencies in transit countries to help them combat people smuggling."

 He said the Government was also providing funds to boost the integrity of Australia's migration and temporary entry arrangements by addressing people smuggling and immigration fraud at the source.

 "An additional $12.4 million will be allocated over four years to place immigration compliance officers at Australia's posts initially in Islamabad, Belgrade, Moscow, Amman, Tehran, Suva and Cairo to combat document and identity fraud and people smuggling," Mr Ruddock said.

 "This will expand Australia's network of compliance officers already based throughout the Middle East and Asia.

 "As well, $3.1 million over four years will be spent on placing airline liaison officers in airports known to be key transit routes for unauthorised arrivals.

 "These officers advise airlines on the acceptability of passengers and documentation, as

 well as provide training to airline staff in identifying false passports and other fraudulent documents."

 In addition to strengthening Australia's border protection operations offshore, the Government is focusing on supporting countries of first asylum to deal with the pressures of large numbers of people seeking asylum.

 "The Government is also providing an additional $5.3 million over four years to speed up offshore humanitarian processing to combat the false perception that unauthorised arrival is the only realistic way to engage Australia's protection," Mr Ruddock said.

 This approach includes allocating more resources to work with host governments and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to shorten the time taken on checks associated with protection visa assessments.

 "This is an important step in reducing the number of people arriving on our shores illegally." The Government is also stepping up its diplomatic efforts, building a coordinated international approach to develop a long-term solution for Afghan and Iraqi refugees.

 "To this end, the Government will provide my Department with over $5 million each year for targeted aid contributions and resettlement support.

 "The Government will also provide $2 million in 2000-01 to develop a pilot program for the use of targeted reintegration assistance for unauthorised arrivals returned to their home country.

 "The pilot will provide assistance to countries that accept the return of unauthorised arrivals," Mr Ruddock said.

 Budget Fact Sheet 1

 Government Acts to Stop Illegal Arrivals Additional resources of $64.7 million over four years, announced in the 2000-2001 Budget for measures to further combat the number of people entering the country illegally, build on a range of initiatives already being implemented by the Government.

 The Budget initiatives include a range of domestic and international measures that recognises people smuggling as a global problem that needs a coordinated international approach.

 Importantly, the measures also recognise the importance of addressing the social and economic problems faced by the countries from where most illegal entrants originate.

 2000-2001 Budget initiatives

 The 2000-2001 Budget initiatives to be introduced by the Immigration and Multicultural Affairs portfolio include:

 an additional $12.4 million over four years for the placement of additional immigration compliance officers, initially in Islamabad, Belgrade, Moscow, Amman, Tehran, Suva and Cairo, to combat document and identity fraud and people smuggling.

 $3.1 million over four years for the expansion of DIMA's capacity to place airline liaison officers at strategic transit points on routes to Australia; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 $2 million in 2000-01 to develop a pilot program for the use of targeted reintegration âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 assistance for unauthorised arrivals returned to their home country. The pilot will provide assistance to countries that accept the return of unauthorised arrivals; an additional $5.3 million over four years to speed up humanitarian processing, and the allocation of more offshore resources to work with host governments and the UNHCR to shorten the time taken for checks associated with protection visa assessments;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 the provision of over $5 million per year for targeted aid contributions and resettlement support to build a coordinated international approach to a long-term solution for Afghan and Iraqi refugees, including:

 the development, in conjunction with transit countries, of a package of technical cooperation; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 seeking the agreement of first-asylum and key transit countries to prevent further dispersal of displaced people who require effective protection until repatriation or other solutions become available;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 encouraging the development of a program for the processing of claims of asylum in first-asylum and transit countries by the UNHCR for Afghan and Iraqi asylum seekers; and

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 improving arrangements for the removal from Australia of people whose claims to protection have been unsuccessful. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 DIMA, in conjunction with the Australian Agency for International Development, (AUSAID) the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Customs Service, will develop, in cooperation with transit countries, a package of technical and physical assistance to border control agencies, including:

 the establishment of a new border management cooperation program worth $4 million over four years to strengthen the capacities of government agencies to combat people smuggling;

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 implementing specialised training programs; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» expanding the material and technical assistance provided to law enforcement agencies. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 Previous initiatives

 The Government is determined to strengthen Australia's response to people who arrive in Australia illegally. In recent months it has:

 improved Coastwatch, Customs and Navy capabilities to detect pursue, intercept and search boats carrying unauthorised arrivals; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 prosecuted smugglers and seized, sold or destroyed their boats; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» introduced harsh penalties of up to 20 years' jail and fines of up to $220,000; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿» developed an Overseas Information Campaign aimed at stopping illegal air and boat arrivals; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 introduced three-year temporary protection or short-term safe haven visas for illegal entrants; âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 one effect is that they cannot sponsor their families or access many of the benefits available to lawful arrivals; and âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 moved to stop people who already have effective protection overseas from gaining protection in Australia. âï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 The Government considers these and other initiatives are essential if governments are to stop this illegal movement of people which is expected to cost Australia around $300 million in 1999-2000.
