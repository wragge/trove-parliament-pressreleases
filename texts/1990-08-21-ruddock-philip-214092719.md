 IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 1990-91 FEDERAL BUDGET

 The Opposition expected that in Immigration additional resources  for administration would be required this year.

 This is a result of poor decisions taken during the course of  last financial year. One in particular was the granting of  temporary residency to Chinese Students on the basis outlined by  the Prime Minister.

 This has lead to processing demands which have had to be  accommodated within this Budget. The really expensive services  are however in social security, Medicare, education and training.

 Substantial budget savings would have occurred if case-by-case  determination had been implemented.

 All commentators agreed, the Prime Minister had promised  permanent temporary entry to PRC Nationals in Australia  pre-Tiananmen Square.

 This makes the Minister's Statement that PRC Nationals are  "temporary residents pending future consideration of conditions  in their homeland" somewhat perplexing.

 Is the Minister in the process of re-interpreting the Prime  Minister's decision again?

 What guarantee do the students have that at the end of four years  they will not now be sent back?

 In the compliance area we still have only a 150 staff planning  level to ensure measures to cope with record levels of illegal  immigration are implemented. This is only a marginal improvement  on the average of two officers per departmental office for  compliance work now in place.

 Most of the funds for this extension of compliance work comes  from increased fees from overseas students.

 Notwithstanding the collection of funds for enforcement work,  little if any action against non complying PRC students  post-Tiananmen Square has been reported.

 P.T.O

 In the area of refugee determination it is clear more resources  were required because of the increased numbers of people seeking  access to asylum. A 500% increase is of alarming proportions. A  clear picture of why this is occurring is needed.

 The Minister's simplistic retort that it flows from increased  numbers of visitors and students does not properly address the  underlying problems.  These arise from a flawed scheme of legal  reform which denied access to other forms of relief such a  grant-of-residence status on humanitarian grounds.

 Regrettably the extra funds for processing are at the expense of  overseas refugee and humanitarian places. This is exemplified  in the appropriation reduction from $5.7M to $2.9M for refugee  humanitarian and asserted movements.

 In future, excuses for increased illegal immigration will be  limited as computer acquisition to deal with movement supervision  must be complete.  Computer acquisition capital cost is down from  $2.9M spent last year to $795 000 for this year.
