 IMMIGRATION MINISTER WILL NOT INTERVENE FURTHER IN BOAT  PEOPLE DEPARTURE ISSUE

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, made it clear today that he would  not intervene in the process by which 37 Cambodian boat ,  

 people are required to leave Australia, following rejection  of their refugee claims.

 While he would, of course,  take cognisance of any Court  judgements, Mr Hand said he had no intention of undertaking  any other course of action.

 "It is my firm view that the proper processes of refugee  assessment have been followed throughout," he said. "The  people concerned have been given every opportunity to  present their cases, with natural justice provisions 

 scrupulously observed at every step.

 "I would remind critics that the decisions were taken on the  recommendation of a properly-constituted review body which  comprises representatives of the Attorney-General1s  Department,  the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the  Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs and the Refugee Council of Australia. An observer 

 from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees also  participates in the review process.

 "While the motives of those who are demanding my  intervention may be worthy, the bodies involved must  understand that I will not interfere where a comprehensive  and fair system of refugee determination and review is in  place, and where I am not aware of any grounds to suggest 

 that the system or the outcome in these cases has been  defective in any way.

 "I look forward with interest to the deliberations of the  Federal Court on the matter."
