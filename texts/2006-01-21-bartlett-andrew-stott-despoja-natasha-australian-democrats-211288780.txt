 WEST PAPUA SHOOTINGS   

 The Australian Democrats today expressed their great concern at reports four West Papuans have been shot  by the Indonesian military, TNI, in Paniai.   

 "These reports are particularly disturbing given the West Papuans involved apparently are from the same area  as those who are now detained at Christmas Island," Democrats' Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Senator  Natasha Stott Despoja said. 

 

 "This latest violence highlights the ongoing human rights abuses in that region. The Australian Government  has a role to play in ensuring the safety of these people, both those who are now within our borders and those  who are still in West Papua fearing for their lives."   

 Last year, Senator Stott Despoja spoke at the launch of "Genocide in West Papua? The role of the Indonesian  state apparatus and a current needs assessment of the Papuan people", which she labelled a 'damning  indictment of inaction'. 

 

 "The situation in West Papua requires determined and immediate action by the international community,"  Senator Stott Despoja said.   

 Democrats' Immigration Spokesperson Senator Andrew Bartlett said that due to increasing Indonesian  boarder control between West Papua and PNG, the asylum seekers detained at Christmas Island were left  with little choice but to leave the way they did.   

 "It is imperative that the public spotlight remains on the West Papuans so that any ‘political sensitivities’  regarding Indonesia do not get in the way of justice.  This will be a difficult task given the transfer of the  asylum seeker to Christmas Island - at great public expense - where it is extremely difficult to access legal  assistance or to get media coverage," Senator Bartlett said. 

 

 "I have visited the existing facilities on Christmas Island twice, along with visits to all mainland centres.   Facilities available on Christmas Island are inadequate when compared with mainland centres.   

 "Australia has a disappointing historical record in dealing with asylums seekers from West Papua. Any claims  raised by the 43 asylum seekers need to be assessed on merit not coloured by Australia's relationship with  Indonesia," Senator Bartlett said.
