 LABOR’S PLANS FOR NAURU IMMIGRATION CENTRE NOT THOUGHT  THROUGH   

 

 

 “The Rudd Labor Government’s plans to shut the immigration detention centre  in Nauru show that they have again failed to think through the effect of their  policies and the impact they will have on Australia’s international relations,” 

 The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Andrew Robb AO MP, said  today.   

 “The closure of this centre and the impact it will have on unauthorised  migration has not been thought through and the new Labor Government has  failed to discuss the closure with the Government of Nauru,” said the Shadow  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, senator the Hon. Chris Ellison.    

 “This follows Labor’s failure to speak with the Japanese Prime Minister prior to  announcing that ships and planes would be dispatched to monitor whaling,”  said Mr Robb.   

 “The dismantling of the centres on Nauru and Manus Island sends a clear  message to people smugglers that Australia is relaxing border control on  unauthorised boat arrivals,” said Senator Ellison.
