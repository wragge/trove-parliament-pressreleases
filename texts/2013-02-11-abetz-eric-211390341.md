 MEDIA RELEASE    

 SENATOR THE HON. ERIC ABETZ   Leader of the Opposition in the Senate   Shadow Minister for Employment & Workplace Relations   Liberal Senator for Tasmania 

 

 

 11th February 2013   

 Taxpayers slugged $440,000 a month for empty detention centre   

 It’s been revealed during Senate Estimates that Labor spent more than $440,000 a  month to maintain an empty detention centre in Tasmania after it was closed and  Labor promised not to re-open it.   

 “The revelations that it’s cost taxpayers more than $4 million dollars to maintain the  empty Pontville Detention Centre in Tasmania is yet another gross example of Labor  wasting taxpayers’ money,” Senator Abetz said today.   

 “This waste however is only magnified by the revelation today that the Department  has now finally bought the assets at the Pontville Detention Centre for $280,000  which is less than a month’s rent.”   

 “This is the cost of Labor’s policy bungling on a truly epic scale,” Senator Abetz said.   

 “We also learned today that taxpayers are forking out $120,000 a week to have the  Antarctic Division’s A319 on standby sitting on the tarmac waiting to transport  asylum seekers around the country.”   

 “Kerry Packer once famously said that an Alan Bond only comes along once in a  lifetime, obviously he never came across Labor’s Border Protection Policy,” Senator  Abetz said.
