 DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT: AMBASSADOR TO TURKEY   

 Mr Peter Doyle is to be Australia’s new Ambassador to Turkey.  Mr Doyle will replace Jean  Dunn  who  has  been  Ambassador  since  August  2004  and  is  expected  to  take  up  his   appointment in September 2007.   

 Turkey  is  a  strategically  important  country,  located  where  Europe,  Central  Asia  and  the   Middle  East  meet.   Australia’s  long  relationship  with  Turkey  has  grown  rapidly  in  recent   years  and  now  encompasses  enhanced  cooperation  on  trade,  agriculture  and  defence,  joint   projects  to  conserve  the  Anzac  area  in  Gallipoli,  and  a  Work  and  Holiday  Arrangement  for   young  Turkish  and  Australian  citizens.   Turkish  families  have  contributed  to  Australia’s   cultural and economic developments since the late 1960s when many chose to make Australia  their home.     

 The  shared  experience  of  the  Gallipoli  campaign  in  1915  has  become  a  cornerstone  of  the   relationship.  Gallipoli was a defining moment that forged Australia’s national identity, but it  was also a historic event in the development of modern Turkey.  It has created, over time, an  enduring  bond  of  friendship  between  the  two  countries.   The  Australian  Government   gratefully  aknowledges  the  generous  assistance  of  successive  Turkish  Governments  in   making possible the commemmoration at Gallipoli attended by many Australians each year.   

 Economically, Turkey is a growing market for Australia and two-way trade has the potential  to expand beyond the $826 million achieved in 2006.  Turkey and Australia share a common  stance on combating terrorism and people smuggling.  Like Australia, Turkey is committed to  achieving  peace  and  security  in  Afghanistan,  and  has  twice  led  NATO’s  International  

 Security  Assistance  Force  (ISAF).   The  importance  of  the  bilateral  relationship  has  been   underscored  by  frequent  high-level  visits,  including  prime  ministerial  visits  in  2005,  the   Governor-General’s visit in April 2006 and my own visit earlier this year.   

 Mr  Doyle  is  currently  Deputy  Head  of  Mission  in  Kuala  Lumpur  and  was  Deputy  Head  of   Mission in Dhaka from 1997 to 2000.  In Canberra, Mr Doyle has held a range of positions  including Director, People Smuggling, Refugee and Immigration Section from 2001 to 2003 

 and  Executive  Officer  in  the  Corporate  Planning  Section  in  2001.   He  has  also  worked  on   South and South-East Asia issues.   

 Educated at the University of Queensland, Mr Doyle holds Bachelor of Law and Bachelor of  Arts (Honours) degrees.  Mr Doyle is married with two children.
