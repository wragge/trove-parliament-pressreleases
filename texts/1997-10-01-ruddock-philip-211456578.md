  $1.9m funding boost for SA settlement services  "The Government has demonstrated its commitment to regional Australia with community grants  commencing today to organisations which serve regional, rural and remote communities" the Minister  for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today. 

  The successful South Australian organisations who help migrants and humanitarian entrants to settle  in Australia, were announced by the Minister on 28 August as a $1 192 000 package of awards under  the Community Settlement Services (CSS) Scheme and the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement  Strategy. 

  "The funding is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to helping migrants and refugees  settle quickly into their new community, including people outside the major metropolitan areas," said  Mr Ruddock. 

  "The new grant arrangements focus on meeting community needs while at the same time ensuring the  Government and community receive value for money." 

  Mr Ruddock said South Australia had received 40 awards which included funding for 12 projects  around the State. 

  "Around 25 per cent of the awards have gone to organisations serving regional, rural and remote  communities, such as the Coober Pedy Multicultural Community Forum, the community group  COMSERVE Riverland in Berri and the Migrant and Ethnic Communities Centre in Whyalla," said  Mr Ruddock. 

  "Many of these projects involve advising new arrivals where they can obtain information that will  make their settlement in Australia easier. 

  "In particular , many of the rural grants will enable groups to provide direct assistance to new arrivals,  while other grants are aimed at ensuring people know where to go for the right advice and guidance." 

  The Minister said the money would help fund: 

   " information and referral services for recent arrivals, particularly from small and emerging  communities and in rural South Australia;   " specific service provision and case management for refugees and other humanitarian entrants   " support for high-need groups such as humanitarian entrants; and   " support services for young people, women and elderly migrants.  "This package of funding reflects the Government's commitment to providing services which help  migrants and humanitarian entrants settle in their new country and quickly become contributing  members of our community," said Mr Ruddock.
