 MEDIA RELEASE

 ALEXANDER DOWNER - THE SOUNDS OF SILLINESS

 It would be useful for all concerned if Alexander Downer began to regard the Foreign Policy debate in this country as a debate about real policy alternatives - and not just a puerile game as reflected in his most recent release.

 The DFAT Portfolio Budget Papers have become increasingly opaque on the question of the precise composition of Australia’s aid budget. This is also the view of aid professionals. Nonetheless two important trends have emerged:

 1. A halving of the direct budgetary assistance to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees from $14 million per annum to $7 million (See page 66 of the Australian Overseas Aid Programme 2002 - 2003; and

 2. A $34.9 million decline in Australia’s contribution to multi-lateral aid organisations.

 The collapse in Australia’s overall multilateral aid commitment by $34.9 million reflects the increasing contempt for which Foreign Minister Downer and Prime Minister Howard hold for the UN.

 Funding for UN agencies has decreased by 42 % in real terms under the Howard Government.

 If the Australian Government is serious about resolving the long term problem of asylum seekers, it must deal with the problem at source. And a central part of dealing with the problem at source lies in providing a proper funding commitment to the UNHCR - particularly its operations in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

 For the period (1995 - 2002 ) Australia was already third from the bottom of the list of fifteen major voluntary donors to the UNHCR.

 The Government’s response to this reduction from $14 million to $7 million per annum this year for dedicated funding for the UNHCR is that the UNHCR will now be able to also make application for “pool funding” of an additional $15 million which the Government has set aside for other multi-lateral agencies.

 The problem is that this $15 million is available to the UNHCR, the IOM, ICRC and The United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Our understanding is that the UNHCR has absolutely no guarantee that it will receive any particular portion of this $15 million pool.

 It also places the UNHCR in the invidious position of having to satisfy an Australian Government application process in order to obtain funding - in other words, place pressure on the UNHCR to make it compliant with the wishes of the Australian Government.

 The contempt which Foreign Minister Downer demonstrated to the recent UNDP meeting at Monterrey is further reflection of the Government’s disdain.

 At Monterrey, European States set a target of 3.09 % of GNI for aid commitments by the year 2006. The US and Canada also stated their intention to increase their aid commitment. So did Japan. Australia was virtually isolated among OECD countries in not doing so.

 Australia’s aid to GNP ratio reached a high point of 0.47% under the previous Australian Labor Government. Under the Howard Government, it has collapsed from 0.32% of GNP to 0.25% of GNP today.

 Neither our commitment to the UNHCR nor our commitment to aid in general are records which this country can be proud of.

 Ends 15 May 2002
