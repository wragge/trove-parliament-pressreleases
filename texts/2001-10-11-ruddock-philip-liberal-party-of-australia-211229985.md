 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS

 BEAZLEY DUCKS ILLEGALS SOLUTION

 Kim Beazley this morning ducked the question as to his support for the latest boat load of illegal immigrants being sent to PNG.

 When asked 'Are you in support of that” (sending them to PNG) Kim Beazley spent 227 words saying nothing.

 He would not or could not answer the direct question.

 He claims he has a two prong policy.

 Firstly he says 'That requires negotiation with the Indonesians to return to the sorts of positions we had when Labor was in office.'

 Labor never had an agreement with the Indonesians to return illegal, non-Indonesian nationals.

 Indonesia always has, and continues to accept, the return of its own nationals

 This is not unusual. Most countries will accept back their own nationals when they are properly documented.

 However the Coalition Government continues to work closely with the Indonesian government on interception and will continue to negotiate on returns of illegal non-nationals.

 Kim Beazley has also said he will assist the UNHCR with processing in Indonesia.

 The Coalition Government already does that. We initiated the Regional Cooperation Agreement with Indonesia, the UNHCR and IOM to process and resettle interdicted asylum seekers on their way to Australia.

 He further says that after being properly processed as genuine refugees by the UNHCR in Indonesia, Australia will take its fair share to resettle.

 This is already Coalition policy. It was the Coalition that instituted the process outlined above and 40 refugees have already been accepted for resettlement in Australia.

 The second prong of his policy is a Coastguard.

 The current arrangements with Coastwatch, which incorporates naval assets, already intercepts 98.6% of illegal boats. The rest are located when they reach the mainland.

 We already have our coastline patrolled 365 days a year.

 On the question of illegals, Kim Beazley has nothing to offer except an expensive $2billion bureaucracy that even he admits won’t solve the problem.

 “A Coast Guard is not a resolution to this problem,” (Kim Beazley, Media Conference, Parliament House, August 30, 2001)

 The Coalition has implemented a comprehensive, integrated strategy that includes international diplomacy, effective action at disrupting people smuggling rings and interdiction in countries of transit.

 Ours is a long-term strategy that will ensure the security of our borders, and maintain the integrity of our migration and humanitarian programs.

 The fact is that Kim Beazley is not tough on illegal immigrants. He has repeatedly refused to rule out that he won’t amend or repeal the legislative package put through Parliament last month to protect our borders.

 He is quite prepared to walk both sides of the street and his refusal to answer whether or not the latest boat load of illegal entrants should land in PNG or not is the most recent example.

 The question for Mr Beazley is: if he is in office, would intercepted illegals be landed in mainland Australia?

 Kim Beazley’s stance on illegals shows he hasn’t got the courage to take the hard decisions.

 In uncertain times, people need the certainty of decisive leadership, something that Kim Beazley clearly lacks.
