 FEDERAL LABOR LEADER  KEVIN RUDD MP   

 TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT DOORSTOP WITH STEPHEN SMITH, SHADOW  MINISTER FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING, AINSLIE PRIMARY SCHOOL,  CANBERRA, 13 SEPTEMBER 2007   

 E & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:   Education  Revolution; Leadership; Iraq Troop  Withdrawal       

 RUDD:  It’s good to be here with Andrew Barr, the ACT Education  Minister; Stephen Smith, the Shadow Minister for Education here at the Ainslie  Primary school here in the ACT.  It’s good to see dedicated teaching  professionals at work.  The reason Stephen and I are here today is to talk about  the absolute importance of lifting school retention rates.  Labor is committed to  lifting year 12 equivalent retention rates to 90 per cent by 2020.  At present  nationwide our retention rate level has stagnated at 75.  Here in the ACT of  course it’s much better, something in the vicinity of 88.  But what we need to see  is a much better performance nationwide.     

 People ask why is that necessary.  When it comes to improving and increasing  our retention rates it is the best predictor of whether a young person will enter  into full time work or full time further training after school.  In fact one of the  reasons that we have a real problem now with the number of 16-24 year olds not  in full time work or full time study is that our retention rates have stagnated.  In  fact, the stunning statistic today when there is a genuine skills shortage is that of  16-24 year olds we now have some 530,000 nationwide not in full time work or  full time study.  That is a very bad statistic for the nation.  It’s a bad statistic for  those individuals.  It’s a bad statistic for the economy and that’s why we need an  Education Revolution.   

 One of the pillars of Labor’s Education Revolution is to set a goal for the nation to  lift our year 12 retention rates to 90 per cent by 2020.  It’s part of my goal and my  plan for Australia’s future to make this country into the best educated nation in  the world.  We’ve got to lift our vision, we’ve got to lift our sights and take where  we are and make it much, much better.  How we perform with our skills in the  future will shape where we end up in the competitive race of nations.     

 Of course, none of that happens overnight.  It requires national policy leadership  and that’s what Stephen and I have been providing this year under the banner of  an Education Revolution.  One of the best ways that you can predict whether a  young person is going to do well through their school years is what, pre-literacy 

 and pre-numeracy, they are exposed to at the early childhood education level.   What’s Labor’s plan there?  $450 million to ensure that every four year old across  the country has decent access to early childhood education - pre-literacy, pre-numeracy play-based learning.     

 Another pillar of Labor’s Education Revolution is what do we do with that large  number of young people who drop out of the school system through secondary  school.  And that’s the crisis that we have in vocational education and training.   That’s why Labor again has a plan to build state of the art trades training centres  in 2650 secondary schools right across the nation - government, non-government - so that we can take that large number of our young people, boys  and girls, and provide for them a clear pathway and career alternative when it  comes the traditional trades and the non-traditional trades.     

 Of course, the Education Eevolution impacts on TAFE and impacts on  universities as well, but also our plan for a national curriculum and that’s why we  have already indicated what we’ll be doing by way of the establishment of a  national curriculum board.  The overarching goal is this and my plan for Australia  is this: to make this country into the best educated nation in the world and it’s  part of that to lift our retention rates to 90 per cent by the year 2020 as one of the  best predictive ways ahead.   

 Happy to take your questions.   

 JOURNALIST: Are you happy that John Howard has spelled out his  retirement plan?   

 RUDD:  I think that Mr Howard now has a short term fix for the  Liberal Party but no long term plan for the country.  For us we represent a clear,  decisive alternative for the future.  The Liberals are now in disarray.  The Liberals  now have lost their way.   

 JOURNALIST: The Prime Minister has outlined his succession plan. Can  you now say who would proceed you if the proverbial bus (inaudible)?   

 RUDD:  Well, I don’t think Mr Howard’s been talking about proverbial  buses.  Mr Howard’s been talking about another arrangement with Mr Costello of  the type that we had previously discussed, namely the one which was supposed  to have been executed I think during the second term of the Howard  Government.  So, Mr Howard’s plan goes to his intentions completely exclusive  of accidents, illness and other externalities.     

 My commitment is clear.  If I’m elected by the Australian people, I will serve a  three year term.  Mr Howard’s commitment is that he will serve some of it and  then maybe hand over to Mr Costello.  Well, I’ll let others draw their own  conclusions about whether that arrangement will hold up any more than the 

 previous one did which was supposed to have been implemented some time  before the end of the second term.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Rudd are you a lightweight economic illiterate backed by  a gaggle of trade union leaders, as Peter Costello has said, and could you also  tell us how your team matches up with (inaudible)?   

 RUDD:  I think evidence of the fact that the Liberals are desperate is  evidenced by Mr Costello and Mr Howard going the negative.  My challenge to  those two is where are their plans for the country’s future?  We’ve outlined an  Education Revolution.  We’ve outlined our plans for the national hospital system.   We’ve outlined our plans for infrastructure through Infrastructure Australia, the  building Australia fund, and broadband.  We’ve outlined our plans in detail for the  workplace; we’ve outlined our plans on housing affordability and cost of living.   We have a plan for Australia’s future.  Because the Liberals, on the eve of an  election, are desperate and have a short term fix for the Liberal party leadership  but not a long term plan for the country, they throw the switch to negative.   

 On the question of the team that you raised, Matt.  Mr Howard is in the position of  having more than half his Cabinet not wanting him as leader.  That’s what Mr  Howard’s team has said.  I lead a united team and we have, all year together  including with Stephen here, been putting out a positive plan for the country’s  future, across the whole of government - education, hospitals and health, ending  the blame game between Canberra and the states, dealing with the housing  affordability crisis, also tackling the real problems of Mr Howard’s and  prospectively Mr Costello’s even more extreme form of Work Choices as well as  the underlying question of how we would set this country up for long term  economic growth beyond the resources boom.  We have a plan.  The team and I  have been working on it all year.  Mr Howard and Mr Costello, on election eve,  do not have one.  That’s why they are flipping the switch to negative.   

 JOURNALIST: (inaudible) succession plan.  Do you think voters should be  believing, do you think, this won’t go as you say?   

 RUDD:  Well the Liberals have a short term fix for the Liberal Party  but no long term plan for the nation and the Australian people will make up their  mind.  Can I say this though?  We represent a clear and decisive choice for the  future, as opposed to the Liberals who are now disunited, desperate and in  disarray and, frankly, have now lost their way.   

 JOURNALIST: Does Julia Gillard have a handbag full of knives and  (inaudible) stumble, and which of your Ministers do you think would be ready to  resume the leadership?   

 RUDD:  Can I say one of the great things about our great and  glorious Party is that we’ve resolved these matters a long, long time ago.  The 

 interesting thing about the Liberal Party is, not withstanding what was said last  night, these matters are far from resolved, and I think anyone watching this  knows that.  But the Australian people will make up their mind.   

 JOURNAKLIST: Do you think Peter Costello’s position on industrial relations  would be even more hardline than John Howard’s and that, therefore, people  should expect that a Costello prime ministership would see a hardening of the  laws?   

 RUDD:  Well, Mr Costello is clearly committed to an industrial  relations system where there is only one condition and that is a minimum wage  and where everything else is up for negotiation.  That’s Mr Costello’s brave new  world.  I think the Australian public and working families will reach their own  conclusion when it comes to Work Choices, out of the frying pain and into the  fire, when it comes to Mr Costello’s brave new industrial relations world.   

 JOURNALIST: Are you going to be shoe-in now at the election now a vote  for Howard is a vote for Costello?   

 RUDD:  I have said from day one, and I haven’t changed until today  and I’m not changing, it’s that this will be a very tight election because the full  fury of the Liberals negative campaign against us on interest rates, on unions, on  experience is only just getting going and what we know that the Liberals are very  good at is running negative fear campaigns.  They’re very good; they’re very  experienced at it.  They have a PhD in it.  And so, that is yet to happen.  We  know, from times past, that that’s effective.  So, if you want the reason why I say  this election will be very, very tight is because the Liberals negative smear  campaign which they’re at again today, has still to unfold with the full barrage of  Liberal paid advertising.   

 JOURNALIST: (inaudible) and preschool literacy, is it really going to be able  to lift retention rates (inaudible).  I mean, don’t we need something more concrete  than (inaudible)?   

 RUDD: Well, so far in our Eduction Revolution, and I’ll turn to 

 Stephen on this to answer you comprehensively, we have released many, many  chapters of our Eduction Revolution.  Today I’ve referred to just three of them.   But this has been a solid, continuing project for us all year with a clear- cut goal  for the nation, a clear-cut plan for the nation which is for the long- term, not a  short-term fix for the party, a long-term plan for the nation which is how do we  make Australia into the best educated country in the world.  Stephen, do you  want to go through the rest of the plan?   

 SMITH: Yes.  Thanks, Kevin.  I’m struggling a bit today so I’m not  sure how long I’ll get through.   

 All of the evidence tells us, internationally and in Australia, that if we make an  investment in early childhood we can massively improve education outcomes.   That particularly applies to kids who come from disadvantaged or lower  socioeconomic or battling or dysfunctional families.  And that was why the first  Education Revolution, formal commitment, we released was nearly half million  dollar program in early childhood education.   

 We also made it clear through our literacy and numeracy action plan that we’ve  got to make sure that in primary schools we get the basics right, that we have  lots of attention on literacy, numeracy, the basic skills, the basic building blocks.     

 And we’ve also made it clear that we see a greater investment in our primary  schools as being important and essential.     

 So far as our effort to improve secondary school retention rates, one of the great  tragedies about 11 long years of complacency and neglect by the Howard  Government is that when Labor was last in office we substantially increased  secondary school retention rates, unfortunately under the Howard Government  they’ve effectively stagnated at 75 per cent.     

 Again, all of the studies, all of the international and domestic research tells us  that if you finish secondary school, if you complete secondary school, you  effectively double your chance of going on for a further qualification, whether it’s  apprenticeship, vocational training or university, and you double your chance of  remaining in gainful employment for all of your adult working life.  And we think if  we make the investments early on, back that up in primary schools, make sure  that there is a much greater emphasis on the vocational and training schemes for  our trades training proposals which will be open to the 1.5 million secondary  students who go to our 2650 secondary schools, and that’s contrasted with the  less than 10,000 graduates the Government says will come from their so-called  Australian Technical Colleges, of which there are less than 30 scattered around  the country.     

 So, that is a significant narrative about trying to improve our educational  outcomes.  We’ve announced, as Kevin has indicated, a $2.5 billion trades  training centre program, half a billion dollars for early childhood investment, a  national literacy and numeracy action plan, and as we’ve made clear, there’ll be  more to come in the days and weeks ahead.   

 JOURNALIST: Just on refugees, Mr Rudd, 72 of 83 Sri Lankan asylum  seeks who were picked up in February have been assessed as refugees.  The  Government doesn’t want to settle them in Australia.  Why not?  Do you think  they should be allowed to come to Australia?   

 RUDD: I haven’t seen a detailed brief on this.  I know they’re in 

 Nauru.  Our policy on Nauru is that Nauru has been a huge waste of taxpayers’ 

 money and the Pacific Solution has been a huge waste of taxpayers’ money.   Remember, Mr Howard said in the 2001 election not one of these people, to use  his terms, will set foot in Australia.  Well a hell of a lot more of them since then  have.  Our policy is clear-cut when it comes to the use of Christmas Island for  processing and then to resort to the normal measures available under the  Convention for resettlement.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Rudd, would Julia Gillard make a good leader of the  Labor Party?   

 RUDD: I like your persistence with this line of questioning.  Can I  just say on our side of politics, we put ourselves to the Australia people as a  team united under a leader with a plan for the nation’s future.  Mr Howard now  stands at the head of a team, half of whom have said they don’t want him, and  with no plan for the future.  That’s the alternative.   

 JOURNALIST: I’m just a little confused about your position on withdrawal  of troops from Iraq.  Are you proposing to have them withdrawn by the middle of  next year or to commence the withdrawal by the middle of next year, and has  your position in any way changed since your meeting with George Bush?   

 RUDD: It hasn’t changed one bit.  The language I used to 

 describe our position to Mr Bush is identical to that which I used in Washington  and identical to that which I used with Vice-President Cheney here in Sydney  some six months or so ago.  And that is that if we are elected to form the next  government of Australia, when it comes to the future of our combat forces that  we would see the conclusion of that rotation that the troops would then be  engaged in, on the assumption that the rotation has from the end of the year to  run.  We’ve said consistently that we would renew that rotation, which has a  further six months to run and at that point the combat force would be withdrawn.   Now, what we’ve said is that we would negotiate that phased withdrawal within  that framework with the Iraqis and the Americans and our language on that has  not changed one bit.  That’s the position.
