 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER  THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, NORTH QUEENSLAND   

 

 E&OE………………………………………………………………………………………..   

 Well, I’d like to welcome you to beautiful Green Island.  It is a very very pleasant  environmental interlude and I’d like to thank the resort management for the courtesy of  allowing us to make this very important announcement.  There is no part of the iconic  Australian environment that’s better known, more revered, more loved and more deserving of  support and protection than the Great Barrier Reef and I’m very proud of the creation of the  Great Barrier Reef Marine Park by the Government and all the many things we have done to  provide protection for the Great Barrier Reef and its environs and I know that successive  generations of Australians will always regard the Reef, and looking at it and the millions who  visit it, as one of the most attractive parts of the Australian environment and something that is  deserving of the unqualified support and protection of whoever might form the Federal  Government.     

 I’m here today, in particular, to announce, that if the Government is re-elected on the 9th of  October, it will provide $100 million over a period of four years for a new national  programme.  That new national programme will be called the Commonwealth Environment  Research Facilities programme and its aim will be to support world-class environmental  research.  Australia, as many of you know, faces a number of significant environmental  challenges.  At the top of that list, of course, is the great conservation challenge of our age  and that is water, but there is also the allied challenge of desertification, irrigation, bushfires,  weed management, the Antarctic, greenhouse and environmental biotechnology.     

 We are fortunate in this country that we have some of the best environmental researchers in  the world and the Commonwealth Environmental Research Facilities that I’m announcing the  establishment of today will create national research hubs for Australia’s best environmental  researchers.  Some $40 million of the Fund, $40 million out of the $100 million, will be  committed from 2006 for a period of four years for a Marine and Tropical Sciences Research  Facility to support vital research relating to the Great Barrier Reef and Australia’s tropical  rainforests.  This facility will be located at a Tropical Sciences and Innovation Precinct at the  James Cook University.  The remaining $60 million will be allocated nationally on a  competitive tender basis.  We need to ensure that Australia’s unique environment is properly

 understood and that we are in a position to meet the stretch to that environment in an effective  and a sustainable way.  This national programme will support environmental research that  does not qualify for assistance under other government programmes.  So what we are doing,  we are adding capacity and value to the environmental research effort in this country.  It will  only fund proposals that have a strong public good focus and that can demonstrate a strong  public good outcome.  It will provide support for research that requires high levels of  collaboration and input from several disciplines.  It will encourage research in areas of special  strength or need, including in the national research priority an environmentally sustainable  Australia.   

 The CERF will facilitate stronger synergies and the creation of a set of national research  hubs.  It will build critical mass in areas of Australia’s research strength and national research  priorities.  Funding for this new programme is in addition to the $5.3 billion the Government  has previously committed to Backing Australia’s Ability.  So this is an add-on, it’s a new  programme, it’s in addition to the resources that have already been committed.  And it does  add a further element to the very strong environmental record of this Government.  I am very  proud of what the Liberal and National Parties have done in their own name and in their own  right.  We do not seek surrogate approval or surrogate identification when it comes to our  environmental achievements.  We do not seek the approval of others to proclaim the value of  what we have done to the environment.  It speaks for itself - the Natural Heritage Trust, the  massive commitment to water quality and salinity, the very historic measures we’ve taken to  protect the Great Barrier Reef, the announcement that I have made today, the $2 billion  National Water Fund, which is designed to tackle over the years ahead, one of the great  environmental challenges of our age, the commitment - and I know that commitment will be  met - to meet the Kyoto target given to Australia without taking on obligations that are going  to do damage to Australia’s competitiveness and to Australia’s industry.  It is an environment  record that I am very proud of, it’s an environment record that has tackled in a practical way  the environmental challenges. And finally, could I pay particular tribute to both Warren  Entsch and Peter Lindsay, the Members for Leichhardt and Herbert, who have campaigned  very strongly on many of the issues that are covered by my announcement and particularly  the importance of protecting the Great Barrier Reef and particularly the importance of  investing adequately in environmental research and marine sciences.  I believe that today’s  announcement will be widely welcomed in north Queensland because it will be seen as  another practical demonstration of the Government’s commitment to caring for Australia’s  environment.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 No, that happened as a result of the normal processes of the allocation of that programme, but  what we are doing here goes far and beyond what would have happened if those programmes  had been funded.  And the other thing I should mention is that this announcement today will  be of enormous benefit to the tourist industry as well because we see partnerships, we see  synergies, we see co-operation and collaboration and complementarity between the care of  the environment and, of course, the tourist industry.   

 JOURNALIST:

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, that will be a matter for the people who are actually running the programme.  I mean,  we’re going to establish this facility at James Cook University and there’s $40 million set  aside for that in relation to the Great Barrier Reef and marine scientists.  Now that is a lot of  money, it’s a very big commitment and I have no doubt that there’ll be a great demand for  talented scientists.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Howard, the Indonesian Ambassador has said today that he left the meeting with Mr  Downer and other ambassadors with clear understanding that the Government’s policy about  pre-emption was not [inaudible].  How do you explain that…?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, I haven’t seen that announcement, that statement, and until I have I won’t comment.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Will you rule out launching pre-emptive strikes without first talking to the countries  involved?    

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Look, I would always collaborate and operate in collaboration with neighbouring countries.   But what I have said, and I repeat and I repeat unapologetically, that if it were necessary to  stop an attack on Australia and there were no alternative, I would act in the manner I have  said.  And any Prime Minister having an understanding of his ultimate duty to the security of  this country would say the same thing.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible] country though…?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 We would always co-operate and we would always collaborate, but what I have said if there  was no alternative, that is the action we would take.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 And that includes countries in South East Asia?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Of course it does.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Does that mean that you will work outside the…? 

  3

 

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 My first responsibility is to defend Australia.  Now, I don’t think this is likely to happen but  this idea that the defence of Australia is something that is negotiable in the forums of the  United Nations is a doctrine I will never accept.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Is the only way…?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 The first responsibility of any Prime Minister is the defence of this country.  No, I don’t  expect any of this to arise but I don’t want any Australian to be in any doubt as to where I  stand on the issue.  And I think sensible people will understand it and they will agree with me  and they’ll know exactly what I’m saying.  And none of it is directed against our friends in  the region.  You talk as if it’s directed against Indonesia or Malaysia.  It’s not.  It’s directed  against terrorists and those terrorists are the enemies of Indonesia, they are the enemies of  Singapore, they are the enemies of Australia.  And what I am saying is that if there were no  alternative, and that was the answer I gave way back in December of 2002, I would take that  action.  And the idea that you would have to go through the processes of the United Nations  to act to defend your own country is not a notion I accept.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Howard the suggestion today is the Government has been running two messages, one  message publicly for the domestic audience and one message privately to the governments in  South East Asia. What do you say?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, there’s no difference in the messages we’re running and there is no incompatibility.  I  mean, we continue to co-operate with our friends and our neighbours and there’s absolutely  no argument about that. But it still remains the case that in the very unlikely event that there  were no alternative other than to act in the manner I’ve described, we would act in that  manner.  But I don’t expect the issue to arise.  But if you ask me the question I’m not going to  avoid it, I’m giving you the answer.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Why hasn’t pre-emptive action been taken against say terrorist camps in the Philippines?    

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Because there’s been no evidence that they’re about to mount an attack on Australia.  I was  asked it in the context of a possible attack on Australia.  I wasn’t talking about just, you  know, mounting a unilateral pre-emptive strike against a terrorist camp - I wasn’t talking  about that, and don’t suggest I was.  What I was asked back in December of 2002 was about  an attack on Australia not an attack on somebody else, an attack on Australia, and what I’m  saying as Prime Minister - if I thought there were going to be an attack on Australia and there 

  4

 were no alternatives other than to act as I have said to stop it, I would not hesitate to act.  And  I cannot understand why Mr Latham can’t give the same answer.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 … Alexander Downer says that [inaudible] failed states [inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 That’s right.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 It’s not about any hostility to those other… the countries that you have mentioned.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Howard, the Independent MP [inaudible] Tony Windsor has suggested that somebody  within the Liberal camp has offered him…   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Has he actually said the Liberal camp?   

 JOURNALIST:   

 He suggested that somebody…   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 No, no, hang on, has he said that?   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Well, he’s suggested that somebody with the authority of the government has suggested to  him…   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Are you going off his quote last night?   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Who could…   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, I… can I… 

  5

 

 JOURNALIST:   

 Who would have been in the position to offer him…?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, nobody, nobody.     

 JOURNALIST:   

 Can you guarantee…?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, what I can guarantee you is that nobody has done that with my knowledge, my  authority, my approval, I have not done it, Mr Downer’s not done it, Mr Anderson’s not done  it.  And if Mr Windsor has something to say, instead of slurring my party, instead of smearing  the Coalition, which he’s doing, he should name who the person was.  It is not fair of him to  make a generalised smear, clearly suggesting it’s our side of politics.  When asked, he says -  oh, no, I know it’s not the Prime Minister.  Well, of course, it’s not.  Now, if he’s got  something he should come out with it, otherwise I would dismiss this as an election stunt by  him and he said it was two months ago, well if it was so serious, why didn’t he report it to the  authorities two months ago?   

 JOURNALIST:   

 What was your view…?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, I would condemn it unreservedly, of course, it would be absolutely wrong and improper  and perhaps illegal and it would never happen as far as I’m concerned, and it hasn’t happened  as far as I’m concerned.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Have you made inquiries, Mr Howard?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 I have made inquiries and I’ve been able to discover no evidence of it. But I can’t, you know,  if you’ve got some clown who I know nothing about running around purporting to represent  this or that interest, I can’t be responsible for that.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Howard, there’s a Newspoll out today, is the Liberal Party underdog?   

 

 

 

  6

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, I think what the Newspoll demonstrates is what I have said all along.  And that is that  this is going to be a very tough election and what it also demonstrates is that the big issue  people have got to focus on is who is better able to manage the Australian economy?  There is  a prospect of a change of government.  Labor can win this election and people must therefore  contemplate the consequences to the Australian economy, its strength, its health, its vitality if  Labor were to win the election.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Do you accept that Labor’s education policy, which is basically lower fees for university  students and their schools policy, which favours they say the majority… do you accept that a  lot of Australians would find that more popular than the Government’s?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Matt, I don’t know what the various influences are that play into opinion polls, I guess we  only find that out on election day.  I regard their schools policy as a cheap appeal to class  division and the politics of envy. I have encountered a lot of people who are by no means rich  or elite who are very critical of the policy.  It is a thin end of the wedge policy, you’ve got 67  schools today, how many will you have in a year’s time on the hit list?  The hit list will get  bigger, it certainly won’t get smaller.  Could I also make an observation on economic policy,  I saw in The Australian this morning that Dr Emerson is not going to make any more  speeches about the Labor Party’s industrial relations policy.  Well, I am.  I will fill the gap  that Mr Emerson or Dr Emerson is leaving.  I think the Australian people should know more  about Labor’s industrial relations policy because Labor's industrial relations policy will, if  implemented, will drive up unemployment and put upward pressure on interest rates.  That is  why he doesn’t want to talk about it and it’s precisely because he doesn’t want to talk about  his policy that I will be talking about his policy, starting with an address I’ll be making to the  Chamber of Commerce in Townsville later today, because Labor’s industrial relations policy  is the dagger at the throat of Australia’s economic prosperity if there were to be a change of  government on the 9th of October.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Howard, does that mean you think Rankin’s up for grabs?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, I think any seat is up for grabs, what I... the significant thing is he’s trying to hide  Labor’s industrial relations policy because he knows it’s a dog and he knows that it’s a policy  that will do them a great deal of damage if it’s further explained and I welcome the  opportunity to fill the void.  I mean, we’ve got to have truth in this campaign.  We want the  policies out, we want people to understand what they’re really about and Labor’s industrial  policy will do damage to the economy, it will drive up unemployment, it will put upward  pressure on interest rates and I think it deserves an airing.  It should be brought out into the  broad sunlight; he should even come to Green Island and explain it to people.

 JOURNALIST:   

 Prime Minister, just regarding the Greens, if their policies are so kooky and wacky why have  you preferenced them above Labor in some seats?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, the question of the allocation of preferences is a matter the party organisation  determines.  But, as you know, Liberal preferences don’t really get distributed… except in  very very rare circumstances. And, in any event, I think the Labor Party has some rather  strange policies as well.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Howard, there’s been some suggestions that some prominent Liberal MP [inaudible].  What do you say to people in seats like Tony Abbott’s seat and traditional Liberal seats who  might be thinking of drifting away from the Government because of social policy,  environment, refugees.  What do you say to them?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, I would say to them that we have a very strong environmental policy.  I would say in  relation to border protection that the proof of the policy is in the success that we’ve had in  stopping illegal immigration.  The boats have stopped, we’ve only have one reach the  Australian mainland since December 2001 and as far as the environment is concerned, we  have a very strong record on environmental policies.  And the final thing I would say to them  is that economic security and prosperity cannot be taken for granted.  You cannot assume that  if there’s a change of Government the high company profits, the low interest rates, the job  security, the recognition that we have given to the role of the medical profession in relation to  Medicare, you can’t assume for a moment that is going to continue. I don’t take any seat for  granted, I’m not one of those people who misunderstands the essentially detribalised  character of Australian politics…   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Are you worried about…?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 I worry about every seat.  I am a born person… you know, I’m one of these people who sort  of worries, you never sort of take anything for granted, Karen.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Prime Minister, one of your election pamphlets put out by Scott Morrison suggests,  essentially suggests that Labor would be beholden to the Greens if Labor won.  There’s no  evidence of that.   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, yes, well, yes, well what if Labor wins control of some seats on Green preferences and  there is a balance of power held by an Independent... supposing Organ hangs on in 

  8

 Cunningham or supposing the Greens were to win an inter-city seat.  I’m not saying they’re  likely to but it’s possible.  The Labor Party clearly thought it was possible, that’s why they  went flat out to recruit Peter Garrett.  You see, the Labor Party has pawned itself to the  Greens in order to get their preferences.  I would like to know what deals have been made  over the environment between Mr Latham and Senator Brown.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 You don’t seriously suggest that Latham if he won, if he became Prime Minister, would deal  with Brown on some of the Greens’ more provocative...    

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 I wouldn’t rule it out, I wouldn’t rule it out.  I mean, he apparently believes that the arbiter of  good policy in this country, environment policy, is Senator Brown.  This idea that before you  announce an environment policy you’ve got to get a tick from Senator Brown is not a policy  that I support.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible] give you a big tick.   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 I’m not seeking his approval.  I can live without Senator Brown’s approval, whereas Mr  Latham can’t.  You see, as soon as...I beg your pardon?   

 JOURNALIST:   

 You have for many years.   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Exactly, good point, Matt.  Very good, I’ll bring you along more often.  But, I mean, I simply  make the point that when, on Saturday, when Brown made the announcement about how they  were going to preference Labor in so many areas, which was entirely predictable, the  response of Mr Latham was to say, oh, well, that’s what I expected, I was a good boy and I  went to Tasmania and looked at the rainforests with Senator Brown, as if Senator Brown is  the arbiter of good environmental policy.  I mean, the Australian people are the arbiters of  good environmental policy and it’s possible to regard the Greens as having some irrational,  kooky policies and be a strong environmentalist and that is my position.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 A lot of Australian voters see Senator Brown as an arbiter of environmental policy.   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, the voters are entitled to make whatever judgment... I’m telling you the judgment I  make and my party makes and my party stands in its own right on its environmental record.   We don’t crave the approval of minor parties, we don’t go crawling to minor parties for  approval.  If they want to express approval, that’s their right but we’re not going to adjust a 

  9

 policy to get the approval of the Greens.  I’m after people giving their number one vote to the  Liberal Party on the basis of our practical proven track record on the environment.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Howard, how concerned are you about the beheading of the American hostage?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, the beheading of anybody is a terrible, brutal, obscene act.  It’s a demonstration of the  sort of people we’re dealing with.  They have no compassion.  They have no morality.  They  are acting outside the boundaries of civilised behaviour.  Their brutal action is, yet again, a  reminder that you cannot bargain with or negotiate with terrorists.  It’s a reminder of the sort  of people we’re dealing with and we have to be strong and resolute and not act in a way or  send any signals which indicate that if the pressure is applied we’ll buckle or we’ll cut and  run.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Howard, a few of us [inaudible], how did you go?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 I was fine.  Keep your eye on the horizon, so I’m told.  I’m told that is the secret.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Is that the secret for the election as well?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Yes, look ahead, Jindalee.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Have you got into the PM’s ear about gay marriages?   

 ENTSCH:   

 Oh, the PM’s very much aware of the view.  I mean, this is one of the great things about  being a member of this Party and being a member of this Government, we can actually stand  up there and we can have a view and we don’t get ostracised by the Party, I don’t get dragged  into the Prime Minister’s Office and say, you’ve got to change your view, and this is one of  the reasons why I’ve been so very strongly supportive of the Prime Minister and this  Government.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible] starting to change his mind?   

 

 

  10

 ENTSCH:   

 Well, I don’t think so.  I don’t think so.   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 And I’ve got no chance of changing his mind.     

 ENTSCH:   

 And you know, this is one of the great...   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 I won’t even try.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Me?   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible] said this morning [inaudible] back the underdog.   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 But, hang on, I thought he was backing Port Adelaide.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 But he’s now backing Brisbane, is he?   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, that’s having two bob each way, isn’t it?  I’ll just see who finally emerges.  I feel sort  of, my loyalties have sort of run loose because my team got eliminated from the NRL by one  point and I’ll just see who shapes up.  I think there’s a lot of sentimental support in the rugby  league for North Queensland.  I don’t think there’s much doubt about that but they’ll have a  tough opponent, I guess, if they get there, in either Eastern Suburbs or Canterbury.   

  11

  12

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, I certainly don’t want to get marooned out here with you lot.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Yeah, we went to Hamilton Island straight after the 1987 election and we...   

 JOURNALIST:   

 To celebrate?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 In 1987? No, I felt somehow or other we should come to Queensland and exorcise something  or other.  Okay, see you later.
