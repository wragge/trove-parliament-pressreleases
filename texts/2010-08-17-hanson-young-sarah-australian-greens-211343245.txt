 We Can't Trust Our Leaders To Protect Kids - So  Let's Get Someone Who Will

 A Commonwealth Commissioner for Children and Young People is needed now to give the protection 

 Australia's leaders seem incapable of providing, according to Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young. 

 

 Senator Hanson-Young, Greens spokesperson on Youth, Immigration and Human Rights, says the 

 presence of nearly 700 children in detention is an example of an Australian political culture that is not 

 watching out for young people enough. 

 

 "The mark of any Prime Minister - or potential Prime Minister - is that they will look after the most 

 vulnerable in the community, and children are amongst the most vulnerable in any community," Senator 

 Hanson-Young said. 

 

 "Yet reports on the Leonora detention centre in Western Australia - where children are being held - suggest 

 conditions are even worse than the notorious centres at Baxter and Port Hedland. 

 

 "The problem is that we can't trust either Tony Abbott or Julia Gillard to protect kids, and we can't trust 

 them to keep them out of detention. 

 

 "That's why the Greens will bring on a bill to establish a Commonwealth Commissioner for Children and 

 Young People in the new parliament." 

 

 The Commissioner would tackle serious problems such as child abuse, neglect, poor education, poverty, 

 youth homelessness and social disadvantage. The Commissioner would provide a voice for young  people, 

 a means of communication with Government, and a simple avenue for complaint for ill-treatment. 

 

 "Whether it is children in child care or state care, in the education system, the juvenile justice system, 

 immigration detention or the homeless, whether they are in big cities, small towns or outback  communities, 

 all young people deserve to have someone looking out for their interests. 

 

 "The Greens will stand up for children's rights - the question is why won't Labor or the Coalition?"
