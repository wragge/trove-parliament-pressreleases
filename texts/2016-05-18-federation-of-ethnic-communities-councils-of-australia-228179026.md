 Appeal for all political parties to engage in a respectful, informed and  reasonable debate on refugee issues   

 18 MAY 2016  The Federation of Ethnic Communities’ Councils of Australia (FECCA), as the peak national body  representing Australians from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds, urges all  political parties to engage in a respectful, informed and reasonable debate on refugee issues,  and ensure that the discourse does not marginalise this vulnerable group. 

 This appeal is particularly relevant in view of the comments made by the Minister for  Immigration and Border Protection Peter Dutton, relating an increase of the refugee intake  resulting in ‘illiterate and innumerate’ refugees taking Australia jobs. 

 FECCA Chairperson Joe Caputo said, “At FECCA we are calling for the discussion to be brought  within the bounds of acceptable discourse.  We are concerned that the current tone could incite  division among communities in this very sensitive area.” 

 “Historically, refugees have contributed to the social, cultural and economic fabric of the  country, with Australia greatly benefiting from this unique composition.” 

 Data from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship on the economic, social and civic  contributions of first and second generation humanitarian entrants indicates that humanitarian  entrants are the most entrepreneurial in Australia. 

 Humanitarian entrants tend to work several jobs in their first few years in Australia in order to  finance their own business.  They display greater entrepreneurial qualities compared to other  migrant groups, with a higher than average proportion engaging in small and medium business  enterprises. 

 Australian society is also enriched from a successful humanitarian programme via a number of  non-economic contributions, such as mitigating our ageing local population, enhancing 

 Australia’s cultural and linguistic diversity, providing volunteering and social care roles and  contributing to the development of rural and regional areas. 

 With growing global needs for refugee resettlement, FECCA reiterates our call for Australia to  stand by our moral and international obligations and provide refugee resettlement, as well as  ensure and contribute to protecting peace and security globally.
