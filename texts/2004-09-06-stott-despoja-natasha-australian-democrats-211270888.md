 First Time Voters Kit Launched 85000 WA Young People Eligible

 The Australian Democrats today urged first time voters across the country to have their say at  the ballot box by enrolling to vote before the rolls close tomorrow.

 Senator Natasha Stott Despoja said first time voters would play a key role in the outcome of the  upcoming Federal election.

 "There are about 85,000 young people in Western Australia who will be eligible to vote for the  first time on October 9," Senator Stott Despoja said.

 "The aim of our First Time Voters Kit is twofold. It aims to both encourage young voters to enrol  to vote, and help to demystify our electoral system."

 The kit contains an Electoral Enrolment form, an explanation of our preferential voting system,  and some information on Democrats policies.

 "Young people are a powerful political force and it is important they know how the electoral  system works and how they can ensure their vote reflects their voting intentions," Senator Stott  Despoja said.

 "Every vote is important and votes are never wasted if cast correctly. Marginal seats in  particular are often decided by only a handful of votes."

 Senator Stott Despoja said it was not just young people, but also new Australian citizens,  including former refugees and migrants, who needed to enrol to vote. 

 "Many people may not realise they only have til tomorrow night to ensure they are on the  electoral roll," Senator Stott Despoja said.

 The First Time Voters Kit will be distributed by Democrat candidates.
