  VPS 105/2004 

  The Government's success in securing Australia's borders has meant that our humanitarian  program is helping more of those most in need of resettlement in Australia, Minister for  Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone said today. 

  '13 851 humanitarian visas were granted in 2003-04, the largest number in eight years,' the  Minister said. 

  'The most pleasing aspect of this increased intake was that we were able to help more people  escape refugee situations in places like Sudan, with eighty five per cent of the program  coming from offshore. 

  'Australia has granted 14 442 humanitarian visas to Sudanese in the last ten years, almost  10 000 of these in the last two years. 

  'The Government has been able to increase its long term commitment to dealing with refugee  situation because our border control policies have put a stop to unauthorised boat arrivals. 

  'Australia works closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in  determining resettlement priorities. Our commitment to helping people escape often  horrendous conditions in Africa will continue this year.' 

  'It is not a widely know fact that Australia has such a generous Refugee and Humanitarian  program. I n  fact, Australia will spend, across Government, about $2 billion over the next four  years on this Program. 

  'It is the first time for some years that the program has been fully utilised, with no carry  over.'
