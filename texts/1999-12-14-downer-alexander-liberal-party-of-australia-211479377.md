  AUSTRALIA PROVIDES HEALTH 
ASSISTANCE    
TO REFUGEES IN WEST TIMOR

  Australia will provide $3 
million to meet the emergency health needs of up to 140,000 East Timorese 
peop  le still isolated in refugee camps in West Timor. 

  The Government is deeply concerned at reports that 
over 150 people, mostly children, have recently died in the Tuapukan 
camp. The World Health Organisation has warned that contaminated ground 
water sources and unhygienic conditions have contributed to the deteriorating 
health situation. Outbreaks of malaria and dengue fever are also anticipated, 
with the onset of the wet season. 

  East Timorese refugees are at grave risk of dying 
from preventable diseases. This Australian humanitarian assistance will 
assist local health authorities and international agencies to contain 
current health problems and prevent outbreaks in the future. 

  To address the immediate health problems, Australia 
will commit $760,000 to assist UNICEF with the deployment of mobile 
health units, which will provide basic health care and immunisation 
programs in the camps. The World Health Organisation (WHO) will also 
conduct a malaria control program in the environs of the camps with 
an Australian grant of $640,000. 

  To help prevent further outbreaks of communicable 
diseases, Australia will provide $400,000 for water and sanitation programs 
initiated by non-government organisations. These funds will supplement 
our previous commitment for relief assistance programs through these 
agencies. 

  In order to ensure that the health situation in the 
camps and surrounds is adequately monitored in the future, WHO will 
develop a health surveillance and epidemic response capacity with local 
health authorities, funded by $1.2 million, provided under the Australian 
Government's overseas aid programme. 

  Many of these interventions will have longer-term 
benefits for West Timorese communities as well as addressing the immediate 
needs of displaced East Timorese. This funding is part of Australia's 
overall commitment of $37 million in humanitarian assistance to the 
people of East Timor.
