 Bartlett Finishes Fast, Continues Fight For Justice

 Queensland Senator Andrew Bartlett has finished the fast he began last week in support of the  asylum seekers in Baxter, handing over to other Australians who will go without food in support  of the detainees plight.

 Senator Bartlett ended his fast at a protest outside the Immigration Department offices in  Brisbane. Speaking at the protest, he said he was pleased that the imprisoned asylum seekers  have felt supported by this action and pledged to continue to work with thousands of other  Australians in ensuring justice is done.

 "I encourage detainees to conclude their own hunger strike, knowing that some of their many  supporters in the Australian community will carry that small part of their ongoing burden for  them. The asylum seekers have already suffered enormous damage to their health from being  locked up for so many years by the Government. I dont want them risking more harm to their  well-being."

 "As usually happens when it is criticised, the Government resorted to personal attacks, with the  Immigration Minister, Senator Vanstone, attacking my protest as 'silly' and sending a bad  message. 

 "I believe it is the Government who is guilty of sending a bad message by keeping innocent  people locked up for years. Our country was once known across the globe as a defender of  human rights, now we're an abuser of them."

 The people taking over fasting from Senator Bartlett will be part of an ongoing rolling strike into  the New Year, with each person going without food for a maximum of three days. Doctors have  agreed to provide medical advice and supervision if necessary. 

 Senator Bartlett said he believed his protest had served its purpose of drawing greater attention  to the suffering and plight faced by the many detainees still imprisoned in Baxter, Christmas  Island and Nauru by the Australian Government.

 "It shouldnt need actions like this to draw attention to such disgraceful abuses of our rights and  freedoms. However, after battling hard all year with limited success to get action and attention  on the trauma being inflicted on these people, the fact is that this action has generated far more  attention on the issue. I have received well over a hundred messages of support, from people  all over the world. 

 "The task remains to build greater public understanding of the massive harm being done to  innocent people."
