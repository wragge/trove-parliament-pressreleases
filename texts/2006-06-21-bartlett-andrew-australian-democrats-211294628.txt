 Message to lib backbenchers: don't forget changes must apply to EXISTING  REFUGEE laws

 Queensland Democrat Senator Andrew Bartlett has urged Liberal backbenchers negotiating on the new  anti-refugee law to ensure any improvements apply to all people sent to Nauru, not just those who make  it to the mainland.   

 "A fact which has been lost in the current debate is that the problems in the new legislation are no  different to those that exist under the current law, which already enables asylum seekers who land on  excised islands to be sent to Nauru," Senator Bartlett said.   

 "If the Liberal rebels gain improvements to the new law, it must also apply to the existing law."   

 "The Labor Party, who supported the legislation in 2001 allowing asylum seekers to be sent to Nauru,  must also commit to reversing their stand. It is hypocritical to attack the Government's new legislation  without recognising that the existing law is equally flawed."   

 Senator Bartlett, who is the only Senator to have visited Nauru to meet with refugees, said a key test  would be whether the two Iraqi men still stuck on the island could get an independent review of their  rejection by ASIO.   

 "If those two men were in Australia, they would be able to seek a review from the Administrative Appeals  Tribunal of their rejection by ASIO. Instead, they have been stuck on Nauru for four and a half years with  literally nowhere to go and not even know the reasons for their rejection."   

 "The Liberal backbenchers are in a position to ensure no one who is sent to the island in the future is put  in the same situation."
