 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH   

 22 December 2011   

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   DOORSTOP INTERVIEW,   SYDNEY 

 

 Subjects: The government’s failed border protection policies.    

 E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I think it’s great that the Labor Party have finally woken up to the fact that we really do need Nauru if we  are going to stop the boats.    

 We don’t just need Nauru, we also need temporary protection visas and the option of turning boats around  where it is safe to do so.   

 It’s good that the Prime Minister has finally, after four long difficult years, woken up to this. I just wish that  she hadn’t been so stubborn that it has taken 14,000 illegal arrivals to stumble finally upon this truth that we  do need Nauru. Now that the Labor Party has woken up to this they don’t so much need to talk to me, they  need to pick up the phone to the President of Nauru and get Nauru going as quickly as possible. That would  send the strongest possible message to the people smugglers.    

 QUESTION:    

 Do you believe that recent tragedy has actually changed the Government’s mind?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 I think there’s no doubt that this latest tragedy has galvanised opinion but it’s not the first and as long as the  boats continue coming it won’t be the last. That’s why we need Nauru, we need temporary protection visas  and we need the option of turning boats around where it is safe to do so and thank God that the Prime  Minister is finally woken up to this. It’s just a tragedy that it’s taken 14,000 illegal arrivals for the Prime  Minister to finally see sense.    

 QUESTION:    

 The Government said that it’s willing to negotiate with you on the Nauru issue if you will be considering  Malaysia. Will you be considering Malaysia as an option?

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, the first thing the Prime Minister needs to do is not pick up the phone to me, pick up the phone to the  President of Nauru and once you’ve got Nauru going, we don’t need Malaysia.    

 QUESTION:    

 So, you won’t consider the Malaysia option at all?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, as I said, once Nauru is going and Nauru is capable of getting up and running in just a few weeks,  Scott Morrison and I visited Nauru a few months ago. We saw the facilities. It won’t take much to get that  camp reopened. Once Nauru is up and running, you don’t need Malaysia.    

 QUESTION:    

 From the reports I’ve seen this morning, it looks like Chris Bowen wants to be on the front line of these  negotiations. Are you prepared to negotiate with him or only the Prime Minister?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, I am happy to talk, provided they put a proposal in writing but I do think something as serious as this,  the Prime Minister should break her holidays as she broke her holidays last December when we also had a  boat tragedy, I think she should break her holidays again this December but her priority shouldn’t be picking  up the phone to me now that she’s finally accepted that they need Nauru, she should be picking up the phone  to the President of Nauru and let’s get Nauru open as quickly as possible. Nothing could send a stronger  signal to the people smugglers that the game is up than getting Nauru open.    

 QUESTION:    

 Sorry, and just wanted to know, double confirming, Malaysia is just not an option?    

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Well, if you’ve got Nauru, you don’t need Malaysia.    

 Ok? Thank you.
