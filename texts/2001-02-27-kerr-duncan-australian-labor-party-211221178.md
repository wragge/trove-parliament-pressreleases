 Flood Report Reveals More Policy-Rot Duncan Kerr - Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs

 Media Statement - 27 February 2001

 'The recommendations in the Flood Report into immigration detention procedures reveal more of the policy-rot at the heart of the Howard government,' Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Population, Duncan Kerr, said today.

 'Notwithstanding the particularly narrow focus of the Flood inquiry, its recommendations point to a broad range of problems with the privatised management of detention facilities for asylum seekers.

 'Some of the problems relate directly to the management practices of Australasian Correctional Management (ACM), a subsidiary of American company Wackenhut Corrections Corporation. These are problems with conditions of detention, training and support of nursing and other staff, and liaison with the Department of Immigration and relevant police and welfare authorities.

 'More broadly, the Flood recommendations reveal a fundamental shortcoming of the Howard government's approach to making policy. They reveal more of the undesirable human and economic consequences of this government's blind - and outmoded - faith in the market. Despite these consequences, this government continues to insist that the market will determine who will provide core services, and how they will be provided,' Mr Kerr said.

 'Minister Ruddock will no doubt scramble to be seen to be implementing changes that encourage ACM to lift its game. This may or may not produce some improvement in the standard of service provided. But it will not solve the underlying problem.

 'That problem is the Howard government's ideological obsession with privatisation, and its accompanying refusal to accept its responsibility to ensure core services are provided to an appropriate standard.'
