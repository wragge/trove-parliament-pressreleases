 2001-02 Migration Program outcomes By the Hon Philip Ruddock MP, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs

 [Skilled Migration] [Family Stream] [Effects of Migration Program] [Conference Proceedings] [Humanitarian Program] [Updated website]

 Today I take great pleasure in making two announcements that underline the very positive contribution that migration is making to this nation.

 Skilled Migration

 Firstly I would like to discuss the 2001-2002 Migration Program.

 The program over the past year not only met the target of 85,000 places but was able to make full use of the 8,000 place Skill Stream contingency reserve.

 This brought the program to a total of 93,080, making it the largest in a decade and the most highly skilled ever.

 It contains the largest skill stream on record - at 53,520 or about 58 per cent of the program, this is two and a half times larger than the Skill Stream of ten year's ago.

 In other words, 53,520 highly skilled and educated young people and their families chose to make Australia their home in 2001-02, bringing with them their energy, their knowledge, their experience and their children.

 We are going to be a better and stronger country for their decision to come and join us.

 Family Stream

 The Family Stream has also grown in 2001-02 - at 38,090 it is the largest in five years and demonstrates our continuing commitment to close family reunion.

 In per capita terms, Australia now has a greater level of net overseas migration than any other comparable country.

 The importance of this is underscored by the fact that, on current projections, immigration will be the only thing preventing our population from going into decline in about 30 years time.

 It's also heartening that migration is making a contribution to regional Australia - in 2001-02 we issued a record 4,136 regional and State-specific migration visas. This brings the total to around 17,000 since 1996-97.

 Current initiatives to strengthen and extend the regional focus of the migration program should see this contribution continue to increase.

 Effects of Migration Program

 The implications are clear.

 Immigration is playing a major role in ensuring that we have a sustainable population in the future and a viable and highly skilled labour force.

 The world-beating levels of productivity Australia has achieved in recent years are in no small measure related to the highly skilled migrants coming here.

 Both the Commonwealth and State budgets are benefiting.

 We grow and mature as a nation by welcoming people who are young, have good English skills and who have the talents, qualifications and overseas links that we need to compete in an increasingly global environment.

 Conference Proceedings

 This brings me to my second announcement today.

 In May this year, my Department organised a highly successful conference, aptly named Migration: Benefiting Australia.

 Today I am pleased to launch the proceedings of this conference. I urge you to avail yourselves of a copy and to take a look at what the top Australian and international researchers are telling us about migration to Australia today.

 Let me give you a very brief flavour.

 Chris Richardson of Access Economics told the conference that if we want to be a high-wage, high-income economy down the track, we need to compete vigorously in the international market for skilled workers.

 Professor John Salt of London University emphasised that human resource skills are now regarded as national economic resources for which countries are increasingly competing.

 Ross Garnaut said that skilled and educated migrants tend to raise the incomes of less skilled Australian workers, and compared this with the negative impact of mass unskilled migration to the USA.

 Sue Richardson of the National Institute of Labour Studies told the conference that migrants are overwhelmingly happy with their choice to migrate to Australia, when interviewed six months after arrival.

 Dr Alexander Cassella, an international refugee expert based in Switzerland, gave the conference the benefit of his considerable experience by examining the causes of the rapid increase in the movement of legal and illegal migrants, asylum seekers and refugees and the challenges this presents to countries like Australia.

 Professors Peter McDonald and Steve Dowrick spoke about the demographic and economic challenges that lie ahead for Australia and Professor Graeme Hugo rounded the conference off by presenting his work in progress on the motivations and aspirations of skilled Australians overseas.

 Perhaps Professor Salt best summed up Australia's situation when he said that we have long been ahead of the game in migration research and that we have the most informed migration policy in the world.

 Ladies and gentlemen, I think that both the outcomes of the 2001-02 Migration Program and the proceedings of this conference confirm Professor Salt's estimation.

 Humanitarian Program

 I would also like to take this opportunity to announce that 12,349 visas were granted under the 2001-02 Humanitarian Program.

 Of these, 4,160 were offshore refugee places, 4,258 Special Humanitarian Program places, 3,885 onshore places for permanent protection visas and temporary protection visas, 40 Special Assistance Category places and six temporary humanitarian concern visas.

 During the past decade, the focus of the offshore component of the Humanitarian Program has shifted from South-East Asia, Central America and Europe (predominantly the former Yugoslavia), to Africa, the Middle East and South-West Asia, reflecting changing humanitarian need around the world.

 Against the background of high numbers of illegal boat arrivals, the Australian Parliament passed a series of new laws in September 2001 designed to strengthen Australia's territorial integrity and to reduce incentives for people to make hazardous voyages to Australian territories.

 The effectiveness of these laws in deterring further boat arrivals allowed the re-allocation of places to the offshore component in 2001-02, and as a result, 466 more people in need (a total of 8,458) were granted visas for resettlement that year compared with the year before (a total of 7,992). We expect this trend to continue in 2002-03.

 Updated website

 I am also launching my updated website today.

 It is important for people to have the correct facts about immigration. There has been much misinformation circulated about immigration issues.

 The new look website allows users to quickly access the latest issues and breaking news on immigration, multicultural affairs and indigenous matters and will help people form their own opinions.

 The new categories of information and the media centre allow users to find quickly the information they seek.
