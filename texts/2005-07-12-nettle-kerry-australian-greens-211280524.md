 Senator Kerry Nettle  Senator for New South Wales 

 

 Senator Nettle to visit Afghanis and Iraqis 

 on Nauru 

 12th Jul 2005 

 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle has called on the government to recognise the  refugee status of the remaining asylum seekers left stranded on Nauru and  bring them to Australia.   

 Senator Nettle will visit the mostly Afghani and Iraqi asylum seekers on  Nauru next week and hopes to meet with Nauruan government  representatives to discuss the future of the detention camp.   

 "Whilst the government considers Afghanistan and Iraq to be war zones  worthy of Australian troop deployment they have not accepted that Afghani  and Iraqi asylum seekers on Nauru cannot return home.   

 "There are eleven Afghanis and sixteen Iraqis kept in limbo on Nauru. If the  government was serious about pursuing a more compassionate direction  regarding immigration then the first item on their agenda would be to close  the camp and bring the asylum seekers to Australia.   

 "The asylum seekers left on Nauru have been stranded there for almost four  years whilst the majority of their fellows who were incarcerated there have  been accepted as genuine refugees.   

 "As Greens spokesperson on Immigration I believe it's important to visit all  the detention centres operated by the Australian government including the  camp on Nauru. It is appalling that the Minister has not shown a similar  commitment.   

 There are currently 32 people left on Nauru most of whom are Afghani and  Iraqi, two Iranians, 2 Bangladeshis and 1 Pakistani.
