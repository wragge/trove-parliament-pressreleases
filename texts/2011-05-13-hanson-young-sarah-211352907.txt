 New report condemns Australia’s immigration policies: Greens 

 A new report by Amnesty International is scathing about Australia’s treatment of refugees and asylum  seekers, the Australian Greens said today. 

 Amnesty officials say Australia should be showing leadership in its treatment of vulnerable people  seeking protection, instead of a piecemeal approach to a regional problem, as illustrated by the human  swap deal with Malaysia announced last weekend. 

 “The Amnesty International report shows that Australia’s refugee and asylum seeker policy was a  ‘piecemeal’ approach in 2010,” the Greens’ immigration and human rights spokesperson, Sen. Sarah  Hanson-Young, said today. 

 “The report calls for Australia to stand up and show the region how to defend the rights of people  fleeing violence and conflict, a stance the Australian Greens have long-demonstrated while the major  parties have used asylum seekers as political footballs. 

 The report highlights the consequences of refoulement -returning a person against their will to the  country from which they fled. 

 It stated: “Three Sri Lankan asylum-seekers who had been forcibly returned to Sri Lanka from  Australia were subsequently arrested and tortured.” 

 “The Australian government is intent on finalising an agreement to send 800 asylum seekers to  Malaysia in exchange for 4,000 assessed refugees, even though Malaysia has a shocking record on  forcibly returning people, is not a signatory to the Refugee Convention, and wants a say in the 800  people it will take,” Sen. Hanson-Young said. 

 “I dread to think what will be in Amnesty International’s report card on Australia next year, should  the Malaysian human swap proceed. 

 “There’s still time for the government to stop the swap which was condemned this week by the  Australian Senate in a Greens’ motion and will be debated in the House of Representatives during the  next sitting.”
