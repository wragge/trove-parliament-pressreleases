 A New Life for Refugees - Minister Launches School Kit 

 VPS 076/2005

 Australia’s role in helping refugees and people in need of humanitarian assistance has been highlighted in a new resource for  Australian Primary Schools, launched today in Adelaide.

 Minister for Immigration, Amanda Vanstone, said the booklet outlines the many ways in which Australia responds to refugees  and others who arrive under Australia’s Humanitarian Program.

 ‘By the end of this month Australia will have granted 13 000 visas to refugees and others who arrived under the 2004-05  Humanitarian Program,’ the Minister said.

 ‘Many people are surprised to know that Australia ranks consistently as one of the top three countries resettling refugees every  year.

 ‘Australia provides some of the best settlement services in the world to refugees and humanitarian entrants. It is important for  teachers and students to understand the contribution we make as a citizen of the world.’

 The Minister released A new life for refugees - Australia’s Humanitarian Program at Bellevue Heights Primary School today,  to coincide with the celebration of World Refugee Day on Monday, 20 June. 

 The kit tells the story of refugee resettlement in Australia. It shows how the Australian community is playing a leading role in  international efforts to resettle people from the world’s most troubled nations.

 ‘The kit includes a DVD which explains why people flee their homelands, how we help them and features stories from  refugees and classroom activities for the students,’ the Minister said.

 ‘Public schools around Australia provide an important service in helping children of new arrivals settle into Australia through  New Arrivals Programs. Some private schools have similar programs but the majority of new arrivals attend public schools.  These schools do an excellent job in assisting young new arrivals and I pay tribute to them.’

 Copies of the booklet and DVD will be distributed to primary schools across Australia.
