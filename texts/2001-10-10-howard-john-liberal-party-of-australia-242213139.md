  PRIME MINISTER 

  ARRANGEMENT WITH PAPUA NEW GUINEA TO PROCESS  UNAUTHORISED ARRIVALS 

  I announce that we have reached agreement today with the Government of Papua New Guinea  to establish a centre to process unauthorised boat arrivals. 

  Papua New Guinea has agreed to establish a processing centre to assist Australia in combating  people smuggling and illegal migration in the Asia-Pacific region. 

  The new centre will provide a visible deterrent to people smugglers, and continues Australia’s  commitment to discouraging unauthorised arrivals. 

  The arrangement will ensure that Australia continues to meet its international obligations,  including ensuring that any claims for asylum are properly considered. 

  Australia will bear the costs of Papua New Guinea’s involvement in the exercise. 

  I would like to take the opportunity to express my Government’s thanks to the Government of  Papua New Guinea for their willingness to provide humanitarian assistance, and for their  support in combating people smuggling. Their support, together with support already being  provided by the Government of Nauru, are important in our efforts to prevent illegal  migration in our region. 

  The unauthorised arrivals rescued by the HMAS Adelaide will be disembarked and held on  Christmas Island temporarily, until they can be transferred to the new processing centre in  Papua New Guinea.
