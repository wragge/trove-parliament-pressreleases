 AUSTRALIAN GREENS MEDIA RELEASE   

 Thursday, 11 April 2013   

 Guarantee right to seek asylum   

 Sarah Hanson-Young   

 The Australian Government must ensure all refugees, including those who arrived in Geraldton  this week, have access to legal advice detailing their right to seek asylum before their screening  interview, the Australian Greens said today.   

 “Making an example of people and scoring political points off of them is more important to this  government than properly investigating their claims for protection,” the Greens immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “No matter how much political pressure this government is under to look tough on refugees, it  is wrong to deny people due process under the law.   

 “Any attempt to cut corners and deny them a fair go risks violating their rights and putting them  in further danger.   

 “All previous evidence shows that when men, women and children come here by boat it is  usually out of an act of desperation to flee abuse.   

 “These screening interviews are the difference between life and death for some people and for  them to be carried out behind closed doors, with no accountability or record of what takes  place, is not good enough.   

 “I call on the government to open up its screening process to legal scrutiny and independent  review.   

 “If there is nothing to hide, than that shouldn’t be a problem, but if there is something to hide I  fear for the thousand people who have already been forcibly returned.”
