 Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade E and OE

 From Dubai via telephone hook-up to Parliament House, Canberra - 12 September 2002

 Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile

 Press conference Dubai, 12 September

 MARK VAILE: Good afternoon everybody, how is everybody?

 REPORTERS: Good, thanks.

 MARK VAILE: Okay, I'll just run through a bit of a brief outline of the trip we've just undertaken to Iran with the Ninth Joint Ministerial Commission that I co-chaired with the Minister for Agriculture from Iran. 

 We had a delegation of 54 Australian representatives representing 34 companies, across a very, very diverse range and [indistinct], from obviously the agriculture interests, Brendan Stewart, the Chairman of AWB Limited representing the Wheat Board, through to a number of hi-tech companies.  Companies Newell and Gas Industry, Woodside, Santos, BHP and companies like Oceanus, a tourism-based organisation that's one of the world's largest - or biggest - developers of aquariums across the world.

 So a very, very interesting and broad base of enthusiasm, I suppose, for Australian businesses looking at the opportunities that are going to be coming forward in Iran.

 Some of the outcomes we've agreed to move to the next stage of the bilateral relationship by beginning negotiations on an investment protection and promotion agreement, and the first round of talks will take place on that in the first half of 2003. 

 But given that the Iranian Government has made some significant moves in terms of reforming and reviewing its foreign investment laws, we see it as time to put some structure around the bilateral relationship to encourage more two-way investment, particularly giving comfort to companies like BHP and Woodside, who have been active in the region for some time and are very keen to become involved in the developing oil and gas industries in Iran.

 Of course a lot of the focus, historically, in the relationship between Australia and Iran has been in the agriculture sector.  Of course we've got a very large wheat trade with Iran, it's a very important market. 

 Whilst we were there, we received re-confirmation of the latest order for 530,000 tons of Australian wheat, which takes this year's sales, year to date, to 1.8 million tons.  The Chairman of AWB Limited, Brendan Stewart, has indicated from the meetings that he has had that he's quite positive that there will be further orders through the year.  So this is good news for Australia's wheat farmers as they face, in many parts of Australia, a fairly severe drought that this very important market is holding firm for us, and growing.

 Of course, in the science and technology area, we had representatives from CSIRO travelling with us and they've reached an agreement with their Iranian counterparts to establish a new Iranian minerals research centre worth $145 million.  They've been working on this project for some time, and it's going to come to fruition.  And a lot of the technology that has been developed in Australia will be able to be applied in Iran.

 Of course, as I mentioned, the tourism operator Oceanus indicated to us that they've made significant progress in forward planning and developing a large commercial tourist attraction-type aquarium in Tehran.

 The other interesting aspect is the growth in educational services between the higher education institutions in Australia and Iran, and the students coming out from there.  The Curtin University has announced an agreement, or an MOU, that it's undertaken with the National Iran Oil Company to conduct a post-graduate program of courses each year.  Next year I think they're going to open about 40 places for post-graduate courses relevant to the petroleum sector, in the university in conjunction with the National Iranian Oil Company.

 So as you can see, it's been certainly a very interesting last three days.  It's been very productive in a commercial sense.  I had the opportunity of meeting a range of Iranian ministers, from the Agriculture Minister who co-chaired the JMC with me, to the Industry Minister, Minerals and Resources, the Petroleum Minister.  I also met with President Khatami the other evening, and also the Chair of the Expediency Council, former President Rafsanjani.  And they were certainly very, very interesting meetings and obviously covered a broad range of subjects.

 I'll stop there, and am happy to answer any questions.

 QUESTION: Tim Colebatch Mr Vaile.  Can't help asking - September 11 in Iran, were there any commemorations at all of the anniversary?

 MARK VAILE: Oh we, the, we were busy in our, the JMC process with our meetings and concluding the communiquÃ©, but certainly in each one of the meetings - in the discussion and the dialogue that took place -both sides recognised the significance of the event of 12 months ago, the effect that it's had on the world, and we both agreed that it, we have got to do everything in our power to ensure it doesn't happen again.

 Of course, you know, the Iranian side were, very early in their comments last year on September 11, to criticise international terrorism.

 QUESTION: Was there much discussion of it in the media?

 MARK VAILE: Oh well you know the media there it was just the same as everywhere else in the world.  It was quite full of it as far as, you know, the lead up to September 11 th, but sort of on the day I think it was just the same as anywhere else in the world.  I mean there were obviously recognition of that, there was recognition in the media, but everybody was also getting on with their daily lives.

 QUESTION: Minister, Mark Davis, would you say that, I mean just from your discussions that you know the possibility of military conflict in the Middle East, what impact could that have on Australia's trading relationships with countries like Iran?

 MARK VAILE: Obviously there's concern throughout the region with regard to stability at this time.  I think that particularly our good trading relationship with the Gulf States, with the UAE, and Saudi Arabia and certainly with Iran are as solid as ever.  There is no question about any changes in those trading relationships.  In fact with these meetings that we've conducted this week I see that we're expanding and developing a relationship far beyond that of a straight buyer and seller into an area of two-way investment flows and technology transfers which is a, quite a mature relationship.

 And I think that, well the other point that I should make is that in each one of the meetings, that I participated in with senior Ministers and the President, I clearly outlined Australia's position as far as Iraq is concerned, as far as the current situation in our requirement I suppose you'd put it for the UN to act on its resolutions from the Security Council, and certainly there was agreement on that - that the UN should act.

 Underneath that there is a concern in the region in terms of stability.  At the moment Iran is accommodating you know many hundreds of thousands of refugees from Afghanistan.  They have a concern that that may also be the case from Iraq.  They are putting significant amounts of money - I think some 600 million US dollars - in aid funding into Afghanistan to assist with the development of the government that has taken, or in situ there since the war against terrorism.

 And so those concerns are real and they were open and frank about that, just as I was open and frank about Australia's position in terms of Iraq, Australia's position in terms of giving the United Nations to act on their resolutions as far as Iraq is concerned.  But they certainly also share our concerns with regard to the existence of weapons of mass destruction.

 QUESTION: Minister, Louise Yaxley from ABC.  Did the fact that the US had referred to Iran as part of the axis of evil come up in these discussions at all?

 MARK VAILE: No it wasn't raised once, and certainly not by President Khatami.

 QUESTION: How important is it for, in your view, to be boosting trade with Iran, given the threat that trade with Iraq will be cut - wheat sales in particular but possibly other trade - because of the current issues?

 MARK VAILE: Well obviously all the markets that Australian commercial enterprises export into are terribly important.  For us to continue to see economic growth in Australia we need to see continued growth in terms of our exports, and so we need to strengthen and broaden the markets that we're already operating within and find new markets across the world, and that's been our agenda for a number of years and certainly remains so now, and so it is important that where we can expand and deepen our relationship with existing customers and trading partners like Iran we should do it.  We should also continue to look for new markets like we have done recently in Libya and other parts of the world.

 QUESTION: Ray Brindle from Dow Jones here Minister.  Just wondering about the depth of anti-US sentiment in your travels there - particularly in Iran?

 MARK VAILE: I was sort of surprised at the lack of visible sensitivities towards the US.  I mean it, it wasn't all that evident at all.  Obviously there is still a vacant Embassy complex in Tehran, but in terms of dealing with people on the street, the average Iranian in different walks of life, and even senior Ministers, there wasn't that anti-US sentiment in any of the dialogues.

 QUESTION: Was there, and you got a general understanding that people would be prepared to support UN resolutions regarding Iraq?

 MARK VAILE: Well I think that in focussing on the issue, of course it was raised because Iraq is right next door and it is a significant issue of security in the region in stability, and a lot of the people that I was talking about the issue to were focussing on the future - how the region is going to manage any changed circumstance in the future - and they reflect on history and they, they're very very anxious about that, but also they recognise and agree with our view that the UN - it is the UN's responsibility now to take some action.

 QUESTION: Was President Khatami particularly concerned about having a major war at his - the possibility of a major war on his doorstep?

 MARK VAILE: Well I mean they're concerned about the stability issue, they're concerned about the overall issue of global terrorism.  They support the view of the international community that we've gotta do everything in our power to rid the world of international terrorism, and they've certainly made that clear. 

 But the issue with regard to stability in Iraq is of concern to them.  Just bear in mind that they - and they acknowledge that they have been recipriants [phonetic] during the Iran Iraq war - of the use of chemical weapons against them.

 QUESTION: Shane Wright here Minister.  You mentioned the AWB saying they're going to sign off on 530 000 extra tonne …

 MARK VAILE: Well they've already - sorry Shane I'll just clarify that - they've already done that, I mean that order's in.  We, because of the circumstances in, with wheat trade in the region, we were sure, we wanted to be sure to have a you know a reconfirmation on that as well as prospect as we're looking to the future, and they are confident that there will be further orders later on in the year.

 QUESTION: Yeah I just want to take up on it, the, you would have heard some of the figures coming back from ABARE this week in terms of the grain figures.  Have you got a feel from AWB just how likely they are to be able to fill some of these orders?

 MARK VAILE: Oh I think they're quite confident that they're going to be able to fill them, and certainly that's, you know, their commercial activity they need to run themselves in terms of looking after their important trading partners, their important customers.

 Yes I have seen the ABARE forecasts and you put that together with a lower level of a harvest in the US and Canada because of similar circumstances, and it is, it's going to mean there is going to be a shortage of grain on the international market.

 But, you know, that's a circumstances that the AWB I'm sure will be able to manage.

 QUESTION: Are you confident though in terms of a general trading front for Australia the impact of the drought, have you got a feel for how much it might bite into our primary industry sales for instance?

 MARK VAILE: Well if we haven't got 22 million tons of wheat to sell and we've only got 13, 14 or 15 million tons of wheat to sell then it is obviously going to have an impact and we need to be prepared for that, and it's just something that given the broad base of our export effort is always you know a prospective circumstance on the horizon.  If you have difficult climatic conditions that cause a lesser production level, then it is going to have an effect on export figures.

 QUESTION: Tim Colebatch, just following on from that Minister, would 1.8 million tonnes would that make Iraq, Iran likely to become our largest customer - particularly if sales to Iraq are in, under a cloud?

 MARK VAILE: Yeah I think that there's a, there's a couple of countries - and I'm not sure exactly where the figures stand with Indonesia at the moment but they're certainly up in that area as well, and Pakistan - but yes it does it makes Iran one of the largest customers as far as our wheat sales are concerned.

 QUESTION: Right.  Moving on to thction and promotion agreement you mentioned, how much mining investment do we actually have there at the moment and what are the things we're bidding for?

 MARK VAILE: There's been a lot of preliminary exploration work done.  I'm not sure on how much that has cost.  I know that BHP have invested significant amounts of money in some of the exploration they've done, but a number of companies are on the verge of participating in the oil and gas sector.  I know that Woodside, Santos and BHP have all taken away tender documents for the next round of bids that are going to take place, and they had lengthy discussions with the officials in the Iranian Government on that side of things.

 There are other companies that are interested in getting quite close I think to joint venture partnerships developing a zinc mine in Iran, and certainly the Iranian Government is very anxious to develop and expand their mining sector.

 You know by world standards it is not all that well advanced in terms of development, and of course the attractiveness of Australia is that we've been at the leading edge of developing new technology in mining -particularly with regard to the application of software where I think probably about 60% of the software used in mining across the world has been developed in Australia.

 QUESTION: Minister, Mark Davis again.  Can I just ask has, have any of the people you've met - either Iran or in the Emirates - raised Australia's close alliance with the US with you as an issue for them, a problem at all, or something that could affect relations …

 MARK VAILE: Oh it's not, it's recognised, yes it's recognised Mark but it's not raised as a problem in so far as saying well you know why are you so close to the US.  But the thing is that we make no bones about the fact that we take a very independent view on these issues and it just so happens that it is closely aligned in terms of the US position with regard to terrorism ane the situation with Iraq as far as the weapons of mass destruction are concerned.

 I mean I read the clips this morning, and the Prime Minister makes a very good point.  I mean it should not, and we won't have, it said that it is the US that is in the dock on this issue.  You know the UN Security Council resolutions are applied to Iraq, Iraq is the country that is not complying with them, so therefore it is a very simple matter to resolve and lower the temperature on this issue - and that is for Iraq to allow the weapons inspectors back in.

 Now you know I've continually made it very clear Australia's position as far as this is concerned and that we are going to, as a part of the UN general assembly this week, and the Prime Minister will be making an address on Friday, put Australia's position that we expect the UN to act on its resolutions.

 QUESTION: Minister, Louise Yaxley, did Iran or any of the other, or anyone in the Emirates raise Israel's failure to comply with UN obligations?

 MARK VAILE: No not directly.  I mean there was comment about the circumstance in the Middle East with regard to Israel and Palestine and of course the, all the Arab countries stand behind the position that the Arab League has taken in that regard, but no it wasn't raised directly with me no.

 QUESTION: Just on, you said that you also had high-tech people there on the business delegation.  Can you tell us something about what they were looking at in Iran?

 MARK VAILE: Government e-business fundamentally.  A company called - Mark Croxford should well have a book there - it's Vecien - Vecien - and they've got you know wireless technology that they use with smart cards and particularly with regard to development of you know an e-based business system with government.  Australia leads the world in terms of our application of that in government activities, and I know that Dr Peter Solomons is the guys name from Vecien and he was, spent a couple of days in advance of us, arriving here in the UAE talking to senior government Ministers in Dubai and also in Iran, and I think that he was going to strike with some success.

 But if the, if Mark Croxford can get the delegation book out, it gives a background on that company.

 UNIDENTIFIED: We're just waking him up from his chair now.

   [laughter]

 I have it in my hand Minister.

 MARK VAILE: Okay, one last question, cause I'm going to have to go and catch a plane guys.

 QUESTION: No chance of car industry access into Iran, was that discussed at all?

 MARK VAILE: Yeah it's, it's an interesting circumstance.  It's been a closed market and it's one that we should be looking at getting into.  We had a representative from the Toyota Motor Company with us, and he was talking to senior people in that area in Tehran.  Obviously they watched with interest the stunning success of Toyota and Holden in the Gulf States, in UAE, and Saudi.  Certainly there are European manufacturers at present in Iran.

 There's been State owned car company that built a vehicle that's very much like a Hillman Hunter, but as they open up their economy and as consumers look at buying better products and products from outside, I'm sure there's going to be a fantastic opportunity for Australian auto exporters - given that the infrastructure as far as roads and transport was concerned in and around Tehran was quite impressive, and you know you've got a city there of 12 million people - a population of 60 million people in Iran - and I'm sure that we could very easily replicate the success that we've had in the Gulf States.

 Okay, thanks everybody, I must go.  We'll see you when we get back to Australia.

 END
