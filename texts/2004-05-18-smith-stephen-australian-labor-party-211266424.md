 Stephen Smith MP 

 Member for Perth 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration 

 to the 

 MIGRATION INSTITUTE OF AUSTRALIA 

 Western Australian Branch 

 WA State Conference 

 The Old Swan Brewery 

 Perth 

 Tuesday 18 May 2004 

 Thank you Lance (Lance Fee, President, Migration Institute of Australia WA Branch) 

 To your National President Ms Laurette Chao, Len Holt, National Vice President, your 

 Western Australia members and other interstate guests, in particular John Young, your 

 Victorian President. 

 Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today at your WA State Conference. 

 Late yesterday I had the opportunity to meet with your National and State Presidents to 

 discuss issues of interest to your industry. 

 Today I want to outline Labor’s approach to a number of issues, including our approach 

 to refugee and humanitarian issues, the importance of crafting out for our nation a 

 population policy, together with our approach to your industry, in particular through our 

 attitude to the recently enacted Migration Agents Integrity Act. 

 Over the past few years the public policy, media and political debate on immigration in 

 Australia has focused almost exclusively on the unauthorised arrival, primarily by boat, 

 of people seeking asylum and protection from Australia under the Refugee Convention.   

 Since March 1996, 221 boats have arrived in Australian territory without authority.  A 

 total of 11,696 people came on these boats.   During this Parliament, that is, since the end 

 of 2001, only 4 boats have come.  In September 2002 a boat with 65 people landed on 

 Cocos Island.  In July 2003 a boat carrying 53 Vietnamese practically docked in Port 

 Hedland.  Then there was the boat that was returned to Indonesia after landing at Melville 

 Island late last year, and there was the boat that landed with 15 people at Ashmore Reef a 

 couple of months ago. 

 Most of the recent arrivals have been returned to their country of origin, although the 

 Vietnamese who came close to landing at Port Hedland remain in immigration detention 

 on Christmas Island.  Of those who came prior to the election in 2001, many have 

 remained in Australia either on Temporary Protection Visas or have been granted 

 Permanent Protection.  

 The people who have either been granted Permanent Protection or Temporary Protection 

 have been accounted for within Australia’s Humanitarian Migration program.  This 

 program comprises both offshore resettlement and onshore protection.  Onshore 

 protection is for those people who arrive in Australia either unauthorised or on a 

 temporary basis but in an authorised manner, and who subsequently claim Australia’s 

 protection.

 *This figure includes 5 900 Safe Haven visas, comprising 4000 grants to Kosovars offshore and 1900 grants 

 to the East Timorese onshore. 

 During 2003-2004 Australia’s Humanitarian Program (onshore and off shore) saw just 

 over 12,500 people settling in Australia.  Our total Migration (non-humanitarian) 

 program for the same period saw 108,070 others also settling in Australia permanently.  

 So over 120,000 were granted some form of permanent residency in Australia last 

 financial year.  This has been the fairly consistent level of migration for the past few 

 years. 

 Labor’s basic principles and approach on refugee and humanitarian issues are found in 

 Labor’s National Platform, entitled: Immigration: A Link to Australia’s Future Growth 

 (Chapter 7 - Human Rights and Equal Opportunity for All). 

 These principles and framework approach include: 

 Labor will administer a fair and flexible refugee and humanitarian program.  While 

 acknowledging that Australia has one of the world's most generous humanitarian 

 programs, Labor will ensure that unforeseen world events that necessitate special 

 responses can be accommodated.  Labor will examine immigration intake consistent with 

 a population policy for nation building and will work with regions seeking population 

 growth to find options to assist additional immigration.  Labor will ensure that 

 Australia's non-refoulement obligations under international law are met. 

 Labor's refugee and asylum seeker policy will be in accordance with the following 

 principles:  

 â¢ that Australia should comply with the letter and the spirit of the obligations 

 Australia has voluntarily assumed by signing the Refugee Convention and other 

 relevant international instruments;  

 â¢ that a Labor Government should seek to lead world debate on the new 

 agreements and understandings required to ensure that the Convention and the 

 international protection system function effectively over the long term, including 

 encouraging countries in our region to become signatories to the existing Refugee 

 Convention;  

 â¢ that a Labor Government should develop further multilateral solutions, 

 recognising the importance of regional neighbours, with the aim of eradicating 

 people smuggling, deterring secondary movement and enabling genuine refugees 

 to access processing and appropriate settlement outcomes;  

 â¢ that Australia should seek to eradicate people smuggling, which is an organised 

 criminal activity that costs lives, by effective law enforcement as well as relevant 

 international agreements;  

 â¢ that, as a matter of fairness, Australia should seek to assist the world's most 

 vulnerable whether those persons are within or beyond our immediate line of 

 sight;  

 â¢ that Australia should take its fair share of refugees for resettlement and 

 contribute a fair share to international aid efforts and to UNHCR to alleviate the 

 pressing humanitarian needs of displaced persons;  

 â¢ that asylum claims made in Australia should be assessed in a manner which is 

 both fast and affords procedural fairness, with those found to have genuine claims 

 and not able to be resettled in other Refugee Convention signatory countries 

 provided with appropriate settlement outcomes and services, while those without 

 genuine refugee or humanitarian claims are quickly returned;  

 â¢ that mandatory detention be used for the proper administrative purposes of 

 ensuring the health, identity and security checking of all unauthorised arrivals, 

 enabling the expediting of processing and ensuring that those whose claims have 

 failed are locatable and available for removal from Australia;  

 â¢ that the conditions of detention be humane and appropriate to the needs of asylum 

 seekers, with appropriate arrangements made to meet the needs of 

 unaccompanied children and family groups; and  

 â¢ that the length and conditions of detention be subject to review and that detention 

 centres be managed by the public sector. 

 At our recent National Conference, this platform was underpinned by a Conference 

 Resolution, entitled: The implementation of Labor’s refugee and asylum seeker policy in 

 Government 

 The Resolution is as follows: 

 Labor believes in an orderly immigration system, a system based on the rule of law, a 

 system of integrity which the Australian people will have confidence and trust in. 

 For the Australian people to have confidence in the administration of our immigration 

 system, it must be built upon rigorous procedures and processes, which protect our 

 national interest and our national borders. 

 We must also treat individuals fairly and with dignity.  To treat individuals fairly requires 

 that they are dealt with in a speedy and efficient manner, where decisions are based on 

 fair procedures and subject to appropriate review. 

 Protecting our national interest and our national borders requires zero tolerance for 

 people smugglers, who will be subject to harsher penalties to deter their activities and 

 stop unauthorised boat arrivals. 

 It is also in our national interest to conduct ourselves as a good international citizen, to 

 do our fair share for those who are subject to persecution and who need protection. 

 Labor in Government will ensure that our borders are secure and that the processing and 

 detention of asylum seekers is fair. 

 In Government, Labor will: 

 1. Protecting our borders 

 (i) Create an Australian Coastguard 

 (ii) Implement harsh penalties for people smugglers, including life 

 sentences for the worst of the people smugglers 

 (iii) Effect strong international and regional arrangements to deter 

 secondary movements of asylum seekers 

 (iv) Continue the excision of Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands 

 and Ashmore Reef from Australia’s migration zone 

 (v) Introduce a Foreign Worker ID Card to crack down on illegal workers 

 and protect Australian jobs and conditions, with tough new penalties 

 for employers who knowingly hire illegal foreign workers 

 2.  Mandatory  Detention 

 (vi) Maintain mandatory detention as an essential part of Labor’s 

 approach 

 (vii) Provide open hostel style supervised accommodation for those with 

 prima facie claims who are not a health, security or absconding risk 

 (viii) Remove children from detention centres and care for unaccompanied 

 children through foster or community care arrangements, with 

 children and their family members (subject to health and security 

 risks) in open hostel style supervised accommodation. 

 (ix) Return detention centres to the public sector, with centres managed by 

 Commonwealth Officers 

 (x) Provide access to detention centres for the media and independent 

 medical professionals 

 (xi) Create an independent Inspector General of Detention to monitor 

 detention conditions and to deal with complaints 

 3.  Better Processing  

 (xii) End the so called “Pacific Solution”, with its huge cost to Australian 

 taxpayers 

 (xiii) Determine 90% of claims within 90 days 

 (xiv) Provide an independent review of those claims not determined in 90 

 days, with a goal of processing all claims within twelve months 

 (xv) Process claims quickly through a new Refugee Determination 

 Tribunal, with appeals to Federal Magistrates 

 (xvi) Provide a processing and detention facility on Christmas Island  

 4. Temporary Protection Visas 

 (xvii)  Maintain  a  Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) system for unauthorised 

 arrivals with a one-off TPV period of two years, after which, if 

 ongoing protection is still required, provide permanent protection  

 (xviii) Immediately upon coming to office, conduct a review of the 

 circumstances of each existing TPV holder of two years or more 

 duration, giving priority to those who have been on a TPV for the 

 longest period.  Where a TPV holder has been in the community 

 longer than two years, if ongoing protection is required, provide 

 permanent protection 

 If ongoing protection is no longer required, offer permanent residence 

 to a TPV holder who passes a rigorous public interest test where it is 

 found the person is the sort of person who Australia would otherwise 

 select for a migration program - someone who has made, and can 

 continue to make, economic , social, community and family 

 contributions beneficial to the Australian community, particularly 

 within rural or regional Australia. 

 (xix) Enable TPV holders to access English language training and 

 employment assistance in addition to existing services 

 (xx) Ensure asylum seekers and refugees in the Australian community have, 

 either through Commonwealth, State or community based services, 

 appropriate health, income and settlement support, as well as alleviate 

 the financial and organisational burden currently borne by the States, 

 Territories, welfare and volunteer organisations 

 Labor’s Minister for Immigration will report to the first National Conference after the 

 election of a Labor Government on the progress of the implementation of Labor’s refugee 

 and asylum seeker policy. 

 Today I propose to focus on four aspects of this Platform and Resolution: Children in 

 Detention, the so called ‘Pacific Solution’, better decision making and review 

 arrangements and Temporary Protection Visas (TPV’s). 

 Last week we saw the long awaited release of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity 

 Commission’s (HREOC) National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention: A 

 Last Resort? 

 The HREOC report into Children in Detention is an indictment of the Howard 

 Government’s children in immigration detention policy and an indictment of its 

 administration of that policy.   

 The Government has presided over a bad period here.  The Government should simply 

 acknowledge that its policy and administration has been a mistake and set the system up 

 for the future so that this cannot happen again. 

 If the Government does not do this, on coming to office Labor will. 

 Labor has had the absolute commitment since 2002 that immigration detention centres 

 are no place for children.   

 I again call on the Howard Government to remove all children from these facilities, and 

 note that the HREOC report again highlights the capacity of the Minister to release a 

 child from immigration detention at any time. 

 HREOC has condemned the Government for presiding over an immigration detention 

 regime where the welfare, safety and health of a child is not the primary concern.   

 HREOC has underlined the common sense view that the long term immigration detention 

 of children is not in the best interests of children or in the public interest. 

 The Report found that there were inadequate guidelines in dealing with children in 

 detention facilities between the Government and the private manager of the centres, 

 Australasian Correctional Management (ACM). 

 This underlines Labor’s point that the management of immigration detention centres 

 should not be privatised or outsourced to overseas countries, international corporations or 

 private companies, but should be a matter for Commonwealth officers on Commonwealth 

 Territory. 

 The Commission also found that due to the lack of procedural guidance and suitable 

 resources, children were often placed at risk including during times of violence.  

 Other findings highlight the inadequacy of facilities and resources for children with 

 disabilities.  One case cited in the Report is of a child severely disabled with cerebral 

 palsy who was not placed in alternative detention while the case for asylum was assessed 

 over a 3 year period. 

 Labor agrees with the HREOC recommendation that the Minister for Immigration should 

 not be the guardian of an unaccompanied child in immigration detention.   

 Labor has a commitment to establish a Federal Children’s Commissioner and believes the 

 guardianship of an unaccompanied child seeking asylum in Australia would be an ideal 

 role for the Children’s Commissioner. 

 Labor will now consider all the findings and recommendations of the Commission’s 

 Report in detail with a view to changing the system so that this cannot happen again. 

 Labor’s absolute commitment to remove children from detention has essentially been 

 based on the common sense view that detaining children in immigration detention for 

 long periods of time can’t be in their best interests and it’s certainly not in the public 

 interest. 

 One of the practical problems that we find at the moment is the Government’s absolute 

 refusal to countenance the removal of men from immigration detention centres to the 

 Residential Housing Projects, whether they are 18 or 28 and single, or a 58 year old bloke 

 with a wife and 3 kids.   

 I believe it’s possible to make sensible judgements, to exercise discretion wisely, that go 

 to risk of absconding and security risks, where we can see families, including men, 

 housed in the Residential Housing Projects, of which I am a strong supporter.  

 So I don’t see that issue, which I note the Minister uses as an ongoing excuse, as standing 

 in the way of way of our absolute commitment of ensuring we don’t have children 

 detained in immigration detention for lengthy periods of time. 

 Senator Vanstone and John Howard both say that if children are released from detention 

 it will simply send the wrong message to people smugglers, and will not longer act as a 

 deterrent. 

 The Commission discounts that and I discount that.   

 The reason that the boats have stopped coming is not because in the coffee shops of 

 Baghdad or Kabul that they see a lone person on Manus Island or people in Nauru or 

 children detained in Australian immigration detention centres.   

 They have stopped coming because after three or fours years of neglect, the Howard 

 Government finally got round to entering into an agreement with Indonesia to stop the 

 boats coming.  Saddam Hussein used to be a tyrant in Iraq, now he’s a prisoner of war.  

 The Taliban have been removed from parts of Afghanistan.  These are the fundamental 

 causes which have stopped the boats from coming. 

 And so the damning indictment that the Commission goes through, which the 

 Government now seeks to wash its hands of responsibility for, stands there as an 

 historical indictment of Minister Ruddock.  It will also stand there as an historical 

 indictment of Minister Vanstone if she does nothing about it.   

 Labor also shares HREOC’s concern that despite the extensive consideration of mainland 

 immigration detention facilities, the conditions and facilities for children in Nauru remain 

 unscrutinised.   

 There are approximately 80 children in immigration detention in Nauru.  This is more 

 than the total of all other detention centres put together. 

 Yet the Howard Government continues its on going denial of Commonwealth 

 responsibility for the so called ‘Pacific Solution’.  It would not allow HREOC to include 

 Nauru in their investigation. 

 The Government cannot continue to deny responsibility for Australia’s immigration 

 detention centres in Nauru and Manus Island.   

 Labor on the other hand remains committed to ending the so called ‘Pacific Solution’. 

 Labor welcomes the weekend decision by the Government to grant refugee status to 92 

 Afghan asylum seekers on Nauru on the basis of changed circumstances in Afghanistan. 

 The Government has now made decisions over the last few days in respect of 103 

 Afghans in Nauru.  92 have been assessed as refugees.   

 The Government needs to indicate the status of the remaining 77 Afghan detainees in 

 Nauru. 

 As the numbers of detainees on Nauru are about to rapidly decline, Labor again calls on 

 the Howard Government to end the costly ‘Pacific Solution’. 

 The Government also needs to indicate what is the status of the 50 or so Iraqi detainees 

 on Nauru.  This is particularly the case as the Government recently announced that, given 

 the ongoing difficulties in Iraq, it would recommence the assessment of Iraqi Temporary 

 Protection Visa holders seeking further protection from Australia. 

 Labor has repeatedly said that the Howard Government should end the ‘Pacific Solution’.  

 In doing so, Labor has indicated it will respond positively to whatever transitional 

 arrangements the Government sensibly wants to put in place to effect this.   

 Transitional measures include where further processing might occur.  This could be, for 

 example, at Christmas Island or on the mainland on a transitional basis. 

 Transitional measures also include what to do with failed asylum seekers in respect of 

 whom it is not yet safe to return to their country of origin.  This could, for example, 

 include a move to Christmas Island, mainland Australia on a transitional basis pending 

 further developments in the country of origin, or a third party nation state. 

 I note that Minister Vanstone, in announcing the granting of refugee status to these 92 

 Afghans, has again repeated the following claim: 

 “Australia has made it clear all along that it will take its fair share of refugees needing 

 resettlement from the offshore processing centres and this announcement confirms the 

 Australian Government’s commitment to that”. 

 This is a far cry from the mantra of the Howard Government seeking re-election in 2001 

 that not one of these people would set foot on Australian soil. 

 Prior to these recent announcements, nearly 400 asylum seekers originally placed on 

 Nauru and Manus Island had been resettled in Australia. 

 Recently we have seen the UNHCR afford refugee status to 10 Afghans, and now the 

 Australian Government has afforded refugee status to more than 90.  On this basis, the 

 vast majority of the remaining Afghans could be expected to be afforded refugee status. 

 On the Government’s own admission, most of these will be resettled in Australia. 

 That would see more than 500 originally placed on Nauru and Manus Island resettled in 

 Australia. 

 On that basis, there is no reason in principle why the remaining detainees on Nauru could 

 not be brought to Australia on a transitional basis. 

 The Howard Government should be open and upfront about what is now occurring.   

 The Government wants to have its cake and eat it too here, to slip children and detainees 

 on Nauru out the backdoor and say to some sections of the Australian community: “don’t 

 worry, the numbers are coming down”, while at the same time saying to the rest of 

 Australia that kids will stay in detention and the ‘Pacific Solution’ will stay because they 

 act as a deterrent to unauthorised arrivals. 

 Rather than trying to let people in through the backdoor, the Government should tell the 

 Australian people that this is the beginning of the end for the Pacific Solution.  

 Now is also the time to set the system up for the future.   

 Labor will review the current asylum seekers' appeal mechanism to ensure that its 

 decision making and operation is both cost efficient, fair and consistent.  While the rights 

 of asylum seekers to seek judicial review must be maintained, it is important that a 

 streamlined and more formal system of appeal is instituted to provide a better filter and 

 alleviate the higher courts' immigration caseload burden. 

 Labor agrees that our Courts are burdened with a significant amount of immigration 

 cases.  The Government has made several attempts to ease this burden through legislative 

 changes and the introduction of privative clauses.  Labor believes that before one gets to 

 a judicial review of an administrative decision or a Ministerial delegate's decision in the 

 migration area, it is important to focus on the original decision and the merits review.  

 Currently we have a system where the Minister's delegate will make an original decision, 

 which is subject to appeal to the Refugee Review Tribunal.  

 I have made it clear that it seems to me that there is a want of confidence, firstly, in the 

 initial decision-making process and, secondly, in the Refugee Review Tribunal's review. 

 There is also clearly a need to attend to the backlog of judicial reviews that we find in the 

 courts at the moment.  

 That is why Labor have adopted an approach of saying that, firstly, we believe the 

 Refugee Review Tribunal should be abolished and replaced with what we describe as the 

 Refugee Status Determination Tribunal and, secondly, appeals from that tribunal should 

 go to the Federal Magistrates Service, essentially by way of a one-stop shop. So you 

 would have an effective review by the Refugee Status Determination Tribunal and then a 

 one-stop approach as far as appeals are concerned. 

 Let me take those in a logical order. I have become increasingly concerned about the 

 quality of original decisions made by the Ministerial delegates in the asylum seeker area.  

 I think one way in which the quality of those decisions can be improved is by making 

 sure the individual asylum seeker is fully aware of the procedures which attend an 

 application for refugee status under the Refugee Convention, which is why I have 

 indicated that I believe a system of case managing individual asylum seekers will actually 

 assist the quality of the original decision, will assist the efficiency of merits and judicial 

 review and will also, if in the event the outcome is refugee status and settlement in 

 Australia, assist settlement here.  

 If the outcome is rejection of refugee status and a requirement to return to country of 

 origin, it will make the prospects of voluntary return to country of origin better. I 

 envisage a model where individual asylum seekers would be case managed through the 

 process from day one. 

 There are a number of possibilities as to who might do that case management. I think on 

 its face it is clear that it could not or should not be done by a DIMIA officer; there is a 

 clear conflict of interest there. It could in theory be done by another Commonwealth 

 officer, such as an officer of the Attorney-General's Department. It could be done by an 

 officer of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. My own view is that, 

 on balance, it is probably best done by non-government organisations. We have a range 

 of organisations in Australia whose officers have become very experienced in refugee 

 and migration settlement matters. The Red Cross is one example; the Uniting Church 

 another.  

 My view is that it would actually assist the quality of original decision-making processes 

 and improve the efficiency and quality of merits and subsequent review if case 

 management along these lines were effected from day one. That would include ensuring 

 necessary translators, access to legal advice, access to information about welfare of 

 family and the like. 

 The second area which we believe needs to be improved is the merits review process.  

 My own assessment is that there is an ongoing lack of confidence in the Refugee Review 

 Tribunal. If there is an ongoing lack of confidence in an administrative body or a merits 

 review body then there is a danger that the superior courts, the courts of review, will seek 

 to rectify that problem at source rather than focusing on what they should be focusing on: 

 a review which goes to error of law, want of jurisdiction or breach of natural justice. 

 Our approach is to abolish the Refugee Review Tribunal and replace it with the Refugee 

 Status Determination Tribunal. That would be chaired by a person who is legally 

 qualified. There would be a panel of three, with two community members or community 

 representatives effectively on either side of the legally qualified chairperson. My 

 aspiration or ambition would be to have as the legally qualified person a recently retired 

 state supreme or federal court judge. This would ensure confidence in the tribunal.  

 Insofar as the community members are concerned, in the usual way we would be looking 

 to the appointment of publicly spirited individuals, people who want to make their 

 contribution to public policy. I have described people who seek appointment or who are 

 appropriate to appointment to a range of Commonwealth bodies as right-thinking 

 members of the community who are publicly spirited and publicly motivated. I do not see 

 any limitation on the community representatives, other than fulfilling that general 

 categorisation. In my view, there is no need for necessary experience in this particular 

 area. That occurs in the course of appointments to government panels or boards every day 

 of the week. 

 From the Refugee Status Determination Tribunal so comprised we envisage an appeal to 

 the Federal Magistrates Court on the basis of that effecting a fast, efficient and speedy 

 outcome. I have to acknowledge—and I am quite happy to acknowledge, as I have done 

 privately and publicly in different contexts—that that suggested approach has not 

 necessarily been met with universal acclamation. I have received a range of 

 representations from lawyers or people interested in this area, saying that a preferable 

 approach would be to continue to pursue appeals to the Federal Court and that the focus 

 should be on court based procedures of leave, written applications and written 

 submissions—sensible, court based, timely procedures to ensure that there is an 

 efficiency of review and a removal of the current backlog. 

 Whilst our preference is to pursue the Federal Magistrates Court option, I have indicated 

 that, because I am open to sensible and positive suggestions in this area, I am happy to 

 parallel track, in a sense. In addition to working on that approach of improving the 

 quality of the original decision by a ministerial delegate, improving the standing and the 

 quality of the merits review through the Refugee Status Determination Tribunal and then 

 having a one-stop shop appeal to the magistrates, I have been looking at and exploring, in 

 consultation with interested people in this area, some sensible procedures which would 

 see speedy appeals to the Federal Court. 

 

 The Attorney-General has recently announced a new process for dealing with 

 immigration cases, including the appointment of additional Federal Magistrates, but he 

 still refuses to release the full Migration Litigation Review Report undertaken last year 

 upon which he bases these changes. 

 

 The Attorney’s ongoing secrecy creates a concern that the devil will be in the detail of 

 this proposed changes. 

 

 I have previously indicated that we are prepared to look at sensible and balanced 

 improvements to the processing of immigration cases. 

 It may well be that the Government is adopting part of Labor’s policy in respect of the 

 use of Federal Magistrates. 

 Labor will also support steps to prevent vexatious and totally unmeritorious claims being 

 lodged by unscrupulous lawyers - but will want to look closely at the terms of these 

 provisions.  We will want to be satisfied that these provisions do not penalise the vast 

 majority of lawyers who act appropriately in the advice they give, even if a case might 

 ultimately fail. 

 Let me turn now to TPV’s: 

 Labor recognises that the Refugee Convention has always envisaged that the protection 

 of the Convention might not be required on an ongoing basis. 

 Accordingly, Labor will maintain a Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) system for 

 unauthorised arrivals. Labor will introduce a one-off TPV period of two years, after 

 which, consistent with the Convention, if ongoing protection is still required, permanent 

 protection will be provided. 

 There are currently 8,000 to 9,000 TPV holders in the Australian community.   

 They came as unauthorised arrivals on John Howard’s watch.   He said they were 

 refugees, and said they could live in the Australian community, which they are now 

 doing, some of them already up to 3 or 4 years. 

 John Howard has also allowed these families to live and work in the Australian 

 community without any certainty of where their future will be. Labor’s policy change to a 

 two year one-off TPV will end the uncertainty. 

 Labor will ensure that in addition to existing services, TPV holders have access to 

 English language training and employment assistance. Labor will also ensure appropriate 

 settlement support and alleviate the financial and organisational burden borne by the 

 States, Territories, welfare and volunteer organisations. 

 While our Refugee and Humanitarian program has dominated proceedings in the recent 

 past, it is less than 10% of Australia’s annual migration intake.  So we should also focus 

 on the larger canvas of population policy. 

 In the year 2002-2003 Australia’s non humanitarian migration program saw over 108,000 

 people settle in Australia.  Over 40,000 people entered via the Family migration program, 

 while over 66,000 entered through the Skilled migration program.  The Department of 

 Immigration has planned for a similar level of migration for 2003-2004. 

 Australia’s annual migration intake has varied over the years but the focus of the entry 

 criteria have evolved to reflect the needs of the nation.  That is why today we see over 

 60% of Australia’s annual migration intake is in the skilled migration stream.  And there 

 is more than one good reason for this. 

 Late last year, the Productivity Commission reported that in 2001-2002 there were 

 110,358 permanent arrivals to Australia.  Of these, 82,168 came under the Migration 

 program, 6,732 under the Humanitarian Program, and 21,458 were citizens of New 

 Zealand.  This is consistent with Australia’s regular migration programs.  The 

 Productivity Commission also highlighted the 48,241 Australians or permanent residents 

 who left Australia.   

 Classified as Permanent Departures, nearly 50,000 Australians or permanent residents 

 said when they left the country in 2001-2002, that they consider their departure 

 permanent.  To be fair to those of the 50,000 who will still call Australia home, DIMIA 

 classifies a permanent departure as some one who is leaving Australia for more than 12 

 months.  Many Australians have travelled abroad for at least that period for education, 

 business and tourism purposes and the like, which we have only ever considered a short 

 term absence from home. 

 But in the context of Australia’s migration program, it is essential to consider that while 

 Australia may have some 110,000 people settle here every year, we have nearly 50,000 

 people leave. 

 The point the Productivity Commission was making is that in order to get a real sense of 

 Australia’s migration program, the annual net permanent migration of Australia also 

 needs to include Permanent Departures. 

 If we go back to the 2001-2002 figures, 110,000 people arrived to live permanently in 

 Australia and 48,000 left Australia permanently.  So Australia’s net permanent migration 

 for 2001-2002 was just over 62,000. 

 So who are the 50,000 people who choose to leave Australia permanently each year and 

 what can we do to counter this phenomenon? 

 When people talk about the ‘brain drain’ from Australia, they are talking about these near 

 50,000 people who leave Australia permanently each year.  It is estimated that over one 

 million Australians are living on a permanent or long term basis overseas.  These people 

 are likely to be young, highly educated and skilled, and earning high incomes overseas.   

 We are considered a nation of migrants, but our migration levels over the past century 

 have peaked and troughed according to the political and economic trends of the time.   

 In 1993 Australia’s net permanent migration fell to an intake of only 34,800 people.  

 Australia’s economic downturn saw the Government of the day significantly reducing the 

 annual migration level, which was a stark reduction from the peak of 172,794 in 1988. 

 History shows that Australia’s approach to migration has been adapted to national and 

 international needs.  Adapted for national reasons when economic depression or recession 

 has struck.   

 We also regard ourselves as a good international citizen, as a nation that has taken its fair 

 share of refugees in times of international crisis.  From the post war refugee crisis of the 

 1950s to the boatpeople of Vietnam in the 1970s, we have shared the load.  Similarly, our 

 Humanitarian migration program has changed in recent years to reflect the shifting 

 refugee population from traditionally Europe, then Asia, and now to Africa for those who 

 need our protection under the Refugee Convention. 

 In line with regional priorities as recommended by UNHCR, priority since 2001 has been 

 given to the resettlement of people from Africa, the Middle East and South West Asia.  

 Of the 11,600 offshore visas granted to people as part of Australia’s 2001-2002 

 Humanitarian Migration Program, 47% were from Africa, 37% were from the Middle 

 East and South West Asia, and 10% from Europe.  This should be considered a 

 meaningful change given that the 1998-99 off shore Humanitarian Migration Program 

 was effectively the reverse, with the majority of refugees coming from Europe. 

 Australia’s migration program needs to bear in mind the long term problem that we now 

 face of an ageing population.   

 An increase in Australia’s annual migration intake is of itself not the solution to the 

 population problem we now face.  Our population cannot be kept young on the basis of 

 the migration intake.  The problem is that immigrants, like the rest of the population, get 

 older. 

 As in all areas of social policy, Labor has a comprehensive approach to population and 

 migration.  Its framework can be found primarily in the ALP Platform.  While not 

 gaining the same attention as other areas in Labor’s migration policy such as our 

 approach to asylum seekers and refugees, our population policy was rigorously 

 considered at our National Conference early this year.   

 I detail the outcome below: 

 Labor will ensure immigration levels are set within the framework of a population policy 

 fashioned in Australia's interest and consistent with international and humanitarian 

 commitments.   The system of setting immigration targets year by year without any 

 underlying rationale or long-term policy framework has contributed to declining public 

 confidence in the program.  Moving to long-term planning will achieve greater stability 

 and confidence. 

 Labor is committed to maintaining a non-discriminatory immigration policy.  Labor 

 recognises the economic and social contribution that has been made by immigrants and 

 refugees throughout our nation's history.  Labor regards Australia's diversity as a source 

 of national strength and nation building and will consistently oppose those who seek to 

 poison Australia's social cohesion by fostering extremism, hatred or ethnic division. 

 Our basic principles on population policy are found in our National Platform, entitled: 

 Labor’s New Approach to Population Policy (Chapter 10 - Nation Building). 

 The achievement of Australia's economic and social goals, and our international 

 objectives, requires government to consult widely to develop an integrated population 

 policy commanding widespread community support. 

 Labor recognises the need to plan for a sustainable population and in government will 

 develop a formal national population policy. 

 A population policy will allow Australia to decide as a community the long-term 

 sustainable population we want rather than allowing population issues to be a incidental 

 by-product of ad hoc, political decisions about annual immigration levels.  

 Labor will focus on population policy as a whole, rather than just immigration, enabling 

 the community to think in a long-term and constructive way about issues which otherwise 

 stand to divide us. 

 The development of a population policy will involve consideration not just of 

 Immigration but also of elements as diverse as desirable rates of economic growth;  

 Resource constraints; environmental management; internal migration; urban form 

 industry and regional development policy; and the fertility and mortality of Australia's  

 current population.  This will involve drawing in all stakeholders, including the States, 

 local government, farmers, ethnic communities, industry, environmentalists, Indigenous 

 Australians and the tourist industry. 

 A national population policy need not specify a precise fixed numerical outcome for a 

 projected date in the future. At a minimum, however, it will identify a range within which 

 year to year policy making will operate, and a process for updating and modifying 

 planning objectives as new demographic, environmental and social factors are identified.  

 Labor will establish, as a matter of priority, a new Office of Population to advise on a 

 range of desirable population options, and ways of achieving them. 

 The National Population Policy will be adopted by the Council of Australian 

 Governments (COAG) and will be implemented through a series of strategies agreed  

 between State and Federal Government to:  

 â¢ address the age imbalance that is emerging as the post war generation 

 approaches retirement;  

 â¢ relieve the pressure on families and restore incentives to raise children in our 

 community;  

 â¢ ensure population growth is drawn to the regions and the attraction of new skills 

 results in regional development opportunities;  

 â¢ adopt planning strategies which will curb urban sprawl and provide for liveable 

 cities in the future;  

 â¢ implement a national approach to infrastructure planning to provide for the needs 

 of a growing population;  

 â¢ plan for growth that is environmentally sustainable by reducing per capita use of 

 water, energy and other natural resources and ecosystems.  

 â¢ strengthen our economy in a sustainable fashion by encouraging young migrants 

 to choose this country as a place to settle. 

 Labor considers a good population policy a balance between the common good of the 

 population and the long term needs of the nation.  

 Australia has always based its growth and to a large part its economic success on 

 immigration. 

 Our population grew almost exponentionaly from 1900 onwards but from a very low base 

 with perhaps a 40 year plus doubling time.  Any quick glance at the current statistics will 

 show that growth has now levelled off and while it is higher than some European 

 countries, it is soon expected to fall below replacement rate to about 1.67 children per 

 woman.   

 Once the effect of the baby boom (which temporarily increased the number of women of 

 child bearing age) wears off at about 2030, then our population will decline without net 

 migration. 

 This means that migration will have a number a real impact on our national economy. 

 To my mind, the greatest justification for immigration in terms of a positive economic 

 benefit to a country like Australia is the significant impact it has on our total GDP. 

 The domestic benefits from immigration have always been sold on the basis that it 

 promotes demand for housing and domestic goods household goods and job growth flows 

 accordingly.  I am sure that this is true to a degree.  It is also the case that second 

 generation immigrants are those who have the most to gain. 

 We should not overlook the indirect gains from diversity which introduce new techniques 

 and ideas into our culture and industry either - they can also have real long term 

 economic benefits.  I am sure that the economic benefits to the service and hospitality 

 industries, cafÃ© society and like are real and significant. 

 But in the long term, the real justification for immigration may well come from the way 

 in which it serves to boost our total GDP and thereby enhance our domestic base for 

 export opportunities and our credibility as a nation state. 

 Like all population and migration strategies of the past, we need to consider our long 

 term population objectives and develop a structured program to suit. 

 The Government has been wary of rasing the population debate, but Labor has not. 

 We think that current immigration levels are about right. But Labor wants to put the 

 immigration program on a sustainable long-term basis by devising a population policy for 

 Australia.  

 This will be our goal in government and that means a sharp distinction from John 

 Howard.  

 We intend to get the long-term canvas right. Getting it right doesn't mean setting a 

 population target by 2050 or any other date. It means getting away from a short-term 

 reactive focus.  

 Labor will have a whole-of-government approach. We see immigration as a powerful 

 addition to our economic and social horsepower but we need to integrate the program 

 with our other needs.  

 Labor will create an Office of Population Policy and an Infrastructure Council. One aim 

 will be to encourage a greater number of migrants to locate into regional Australia where 

 there is already demand for more migrants.  

 There is an absolute commitment within Labor to this idea of more migrants in the 

 regions.  

 To address this issue, we need to recognise that some areas are more capable of absorbing 

 an increase in population than others. 

 In October 2003, the Chifley Research Centre prepared the report Immigration and the 

 Regions: Taking regional Australia seriously.   

 The report concluded that Australia is facing the prospect of a population decline for the 

 first time since European settlement, and one key element to this decline is the loss of 

 population in regional Australia.   

 The Report highlights the following:  

 Right now regional Australia is at a crossroads.  The globalisation process has brought a 

 new focus on the role and potential of regions, but at the same time it has challenged the 

 vitality and prosperity of many regional areas.  Policies are needed that can maximise 

 potential while reducing problems.  In short, there is a need to seek to reduce regional 

 inequality and enhance all-round prosperity. 

 The Report and recommendations has come under some criticism.  No one disputes that 

 some of the recommendations, such the adoption of a binding 45% minimum regional 

 share in new migration, can be considered radical.  And there is an obvious concern that 

 if existing regional migration schemes do not keep people in the regions, why should new 

 ideas. 

 We can’t however ignore the debate.  And the reason for this is we can no longer ignore 

 the call for help from regional Australia.  The reality of our population distribution is that 

 rural and regional towns are dying. 

 Most of Australia's population is concentrated in two widely separated coastal regions. 

 By far the largest of these, in terms of area and population, lies in the south-east and east. 

 The smaller of the two regions is in the south-west of the continent. In both coastal 

 regions the population is concentrated in urban centres, particularly the state and territory 

 capital cities. 

 Australia's population density at June 2001 was 2.5 people per square kilometre. 

 Some areas of Australia have experienced significant population decline in recent years. 

 While some of the population declines have occurred in established suburbs within 

 capital cities and major urban centres, the fastest population decline has occurred in rural 

 areas. Most of this decline has been caused by net migration loss. Such population loss is 

 associated with technological, social and economic changes and industry restructuring in 

 local economies. 

 The statistics tell us regional Australia is declining, but we only need the anecdotal 

 evidence to know there is a problem.  Currently there are 8,900 asylum seekers living in 

 our community on Temporary Protection Visas.  A significant number of these people 

 have sought and found work in regional Australia.  The Howard Government has to make 

 a decision on the long term future of up to 7,000 of these TPV holders.   

 To date four Federal Coalition Members of Parliament have voiced their support of 

 allowing these people to remain in Australia.  Three, Kay Hull, Member for Riverina 

 (NSW), John Forrest, Member for Mallee (VIC), and Patrick Secker, Member for Barker 

 (SA), represent regional electorates and want the TPV holders currently in their 

 community to stay. 

 There is nothing altruistic about this support from these Coalition members.  Their 

 support is founded on basic principles of the economic sustainability of their electorates.  

 Each of the three electorates has significant primary producer industries which employs 

 seasonal workers.  In blunt terms, these areas need workers.  Humanitarianism doesn’t 

 necessarily come into it, it’s the reality of a declining working population in regional 

 Australia. 

 So through the Migration Program how do we counter an overall declining population, 

 while helping regional Australia specifically? 

 The Chifley Report recommended in part the following in order to achieve this: 

 â¢ Increased spending of government funds on regional infrastructure and industry 

 assistance in order to promote job creation and therefore make regional Australia 

 more attractive to employers, which will then attract migrants 

 â¢ Greater linkage between the issue of migration visas and the applicant saying they 

 will live in regional Australia 

 â¢ Better incentives to attract migrants with lower skills to commit to settlement in 

 regional Australia, and 

 â¢ Stronger definitions and enforcement of regional settlement programs - regional 

 means regional. 

 No one underestimates the difficulty of achieving any of this, which is why I have made 

 it clear that the Chifley Report’s 45% target has not been adopted as a Labor target.  

 What is stressed is that to make progress this can only be an all of Government approach. 

 Finally, let me move to some comments on your own part in all of this. 

 Firstly, I’ve been asked to comment on the Migration Agents Integrity Bill that was 

 passed recently by the Parliament.  As you know, representatives of your industry had 

 lengthy discussions with my Shadow Ministerial colleague Laurie Ferguson about this 

 legislation.  From those discussions you would know that Labor has maintained a 

 position that voluntary self-regulation alone of the migration advice industry by itself is 

 not enough. 

 The Legislation as it stands now is of course different from what was originally proposed 

 last year.  Nearly 50 amendments were made to the Bill and Labor is satisfied Migration 

 Agents Registration Authority (MARA) and Migration Industry of Australia (MIA) are 

 now much better placed to ensure professional and ethical standards are met. 

 Labor’s primary concern has been the protection of the consumer and the integrity of the 

 migration process. 

 I acknowledge that the outcome of the Integrity Measures Bill was not entirely to MIA’s 

 satisfaction. A number of those provisions are yet to commence operation, as they first 

 need regulations to be in place.  Labor will take a close interest in how things progress on 

 that front. 

 We were pleased that the Government took up our suggestion that professional indemnity 

 insurance be made mandatory. The Government has released a discussion paper on 

 technical issues surrounding this, canvassing issues such as minimum cover levels.  The 

 whole question of adequate and affordable insurance cover for professionals and funded 

 non-government organisations is a major issue in its own right, as the discussion paper 

 acknowledges. 

 We are happy in the first instance to see what the feedback is from the field, noting that 

 MIA already has negotiated a policy for its members. 

 Labor is concerned at the Government's delay in addressing the issue of overseas agents. 

 The Government has promised a discussion paper on this. We do not underestimate the 

 complexities involved in this issue, and the challenges it will present to MARA as the 

 industry regulator.   

 We have been concerned for sometime that MARA was unable to promptly publish 

 sanctions decisions, through no fault of its own. The Integrity Measures legislation 

 changes this, with our support, and we look forward to more information being available 

 on the MARA website, including a listing of agents who have surrendered or not renewed 

 their registration.  

 Laurie Ferguson pointed out in his second reading speech in March this year that there is 

 now “..greater transparency for MARA decisions. In future, MARA will be required to 

 publish details of sanction decisions `as soon as possible' so that people are aware of 

 what is happening in regard to practitioners. It will also be required to separately 

 publish the names of all agents who cease to be registered, voluntarily or otherwise”. 

 We are also encouraged by MARA's efforts to raise the bar to new entrants through a 

 compulsory course of study and entrance examination and impose tougher conditions on 

 suspended agents, including continuous professional education. 

 As I indicated at the outset, late yesterday I had the chance to meet with your State and 

 National Presidents to discuss these and other issues.  The point was made to me about 

 the Government’s recent lack of consultation on changed visa arrangements in particular 

 the skilled visa category.  I understand the need to ensure timely consultation with the 

 industry to enable effective implementation of new or changed arrangements.  I 

 undertook yesterday, as I do now, to bear this in mind as we move to Government. 

 As well, concern was expressed to me about the industry’s view that the changed 

 business migration arrangements will see a stark decline in business migration to 

 Australia.  This anecdotal view seems borne out by the statistics published in The 

 Australian today.  I believe that business migration should continue to be an important 

 part of our migrant intake and would accordingly review the current arrangements on 

 coming to office.  Whether this would see a return to past arrangements is of course 

 entirely problematic and a separate question but the apparent pending failure of the 

 Government’s current arrangements certainly warrant a serious review in office. 

 Returning to the Migration Integrity measures, I believe that in the end all of these things 

 will not only add to the professionalism of your industry, it will also make its 

 contribution to a migration system of rigour, one that individual applicants and the 

 community can have confidence in. 

 Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.  I trust the remainder of your 

 Conference is a success.
