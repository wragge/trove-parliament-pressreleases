 Democrats call for abolishment of TPVs

 Democrats Deputy Leader and spokesperson on Immigration, Senator Bartlett has rolled out the third  Private Senator's bill in his series of Migration Amendment bills which seeks to repeal the introduction of  Temporary Protection Visas (TPV).   

 "The introduction of the TPV is an example of a policy deliberately designed to cause hardship and  suffering."    

 "Not only does it restrict access to settlement assistance and other social services, it also prevents  family reunion which creates a perverse incentive for wives and children to enter Australia in an  unauthorised way."   

 "It was not a deterrent to asylum seekers coming to Australia as the Government proclaimed it to be, in  fact it was directly responsible for a massive increase in the proportion of women and children  undertaking the dangerous journey to travel to Australia."    

 "The sinking of the SIEV-X on 19th October, 2001 is the most tragic example of the legacy of TPVs, with  women and children being the vast majority of those who drowned, some of whose fathers and  husbands were already in Australia."   

 "The Democrats were fundamentally opposed to the introduction of the TPV in 1999 and were appalled  when it was pushed through the Senate with the support of the Labor Party."   

 "It is now time for TPVs to be abolished. We call on all parties to support this move to do so," concluded  Senator Bartlett.
