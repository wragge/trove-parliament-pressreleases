 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  HON ALEXANDER DOWNER, MP   

 

 TRANSCRIPTION: PROOF COPY E & OE   

 DATE:  11am  Dec  31th 2002  VENUE: Doorstop Adelaide Electorate Office  TITLE:   Zimbabwe/World Cup cricket 

 

 MINISTER  DOWNER:  I  just  want  to  say  something  more  about  Zimbabwe   and  the  prospects  of  the  six  World  Cup  cricket  matches  going  ahead  there   during the early part of next year. 

 I last night spoke with the British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, and we had a  long  discussion  about  the  question  of  international  matches  taking  place  in   Zimbabwe. 

 Both the British and the Australian Governments agree that it will be regrettable  if these matches are to proceed in Zimbabwe.  It will be a propaganda victory  for President Mugabe, the President of Zimbabwe. 

 One  of  the  issues  which  is  germane  to  this  is  that  President  Mugabe  is  the   chairman  of  the  Zimbabwe  Cricket  Board  and  for  a  reward  such  as  this  to  be   presented to President Mugabe would be indeed a propaganda win for President  Mugabe. 

 We,  as  Australia,  we  will  be  taking  diplomatic  initiative  to  speak  to  all  of  the   governments of teams which participate in the World Cup and we’ll be urging  them  to  communicate  with  the  International  Cricket  Council  suggesting  to  the   International Cricket Council that it review its decision to allow the matches to  go ahead in Zimbabwe. 

 I don’t have any anticipation of how successful or not this will be.  I think there  will be some countries that will be happy to do that and frankly there’ll probably  be  some  countries  that  will  not  want  to  do  that  and  that  of  course  is  a  matter   entirely for them. 

 But we do want to communicate our views to other members of the international  community  which  are  participating  in  the  World  Cup  cricket  tournament  next  

 

 

 year,  and  we  appreciate  very  much  the  support  that  has  been  given  to  our   initiative  by  the  British  government  and  I  know  that  they  will  follow  in  our   wake enthusiastically and I’m sure as the next few wear on we’ll find that there  is some support.  

 There’ll be some opposition to this as well as we know from our experience in  the  Commonwealth  in  dealing  with  the  question  of  Zimbabwe.    I  mean  we   know  that  there  are  some  countries  that  have  been  opposed  to  action  against   Zimbabwe;  some  have  supported  it.     It’s  been  very  hard,  in  fact  it’s  been   impossible internationally to get a consensus on the issue of Zimbabwe. 

 We  accept  that,  but  nevertheless  I  think  we  should  make  an  effort  to  try  to   encourage  as  many  countries  as  possible  to  lobby  the  International  Cricket   Council and suggest to the International Cricket Council that they’re going to be  moved to another African country. 

 And finally, let me say - I mean the irony of all of this is that there are only two  World  Cup  games  that,  as  I  understand,  is  going  to  be  played  in  Kenya,  and   there are supposed to be six that will be played in Zimbabwe.    

 Now Kenya has just had a free, fair and democratic election where the winner of  the  election  was  actually  from  the  opposition  party  to  the  governing  party  and   this is an example set to Zimbabwe of what can happen.   A country can have  free and fair elections and there can be a peaceful transfer of power and Kenya  is  a  fellow  African  nation  of  Zimbabwe  and  I  think  here  we  have  a  situation   where  only  two  games  are  being  played  in  Kenya  and  six  are  being  played  in   Zimbabwe.     

 I’m not saying that the six should all be transferred to Kenya - I don’t think that  really  is  a  matter  we’d  want  to  get  into  where  they  would  be  transferred  to   would  absolutely  be  a  matter  for  the  International  Cricket  Council  and  indeed   the ultimate decision here isn’t going to rest with government, it’s going to rest  with the Cricket Council, but if we can get more countries to support us - and  I’m pleased to say the British have already been very responsive and I’m sure  others will be too - we can at least apply more pressure to the Council. 

 QUESTION: Is the ICC being a bit belligerent about this? 

 MINISTER DOWNER: Look, they’re  not  being  belligerent.   They  are  in  a   difficult  position.    I  must  say  I’m,  you  know,  understanding  of  the  problems   that sports administrators confront.   I mean they clearly don’t feel they should 

 

 be  making  decisions  the  whole  time  on  the  basis  of  political  judgements  and   there are all sorts of political judgements you could make in relation to almost  any country in the world, and they shouldn’t be getting into that, but where there  is  an  extreme  situation,  as  we  find  in  the  case  of  Zimbabwe  I  think  it’s   appropriate that governments put a view to the ICC and I think the ICC, being  reasonable  people,  and  they’ve  always  been  that,  they’ll  be  interested  in  our   views and we hope that they’ll reconsider.    

  They may or they may not.   I mean, frankly I think it’s as likely that they  won’t reconsider as it is that they will.  But anyway I’d hope that they’d listen to  those governments that we can round up in support of our view and I’m pleased  from my conversation with Jack Straw last night that the British Government is  being very supportive and I hope others will be as well. 

 QUESTION: And what sort of pressure are you likely to be able to put on  the … 

 MINISTER  DOWNER:  Well  I  don’t  think  we  want  to  put  too  much  pressure   on them, we just want to express a view to them.  I mean, look, there’s a limit in  any case in extremis of what sort of pressure you could place on pressure you  could place on - I mean this is a presentation of an important view to a perfectly  civilised  organisation,  the  ICC,  and  the  International  Cricket  Council  will   ultimately  make  their  own  decisions,  but,  you  know,  our  government,  the   British government, other governments, we are entitled to a view.   We have a  view about this. 

 I  think  it  is  particularly  ironic  that  President  Mugabe  is  the  Chairman  of  the   Zimbabwe  Cricket  Board.   I  mean,  you  know,  not  only  is  he  a  very  bad   president  of  a  very  nice  country,  but  he’s  also  the  chairman  of  that  country’s   cricket  board  and  in  those  circumstances  I  think  it  would  be  inappropriate  for   the games to go ahead in his country. 

 QUESTION:  The  ICC  said  it  wants  to  keep  politics  out  of  sport,  politics   out of cricket.  Isn’t that a fair comment? 

 MINISTER  DOWNER:  Yes  it  is  a  fair  comment  in  the  main.    I  mean   obviously they can’t be wrestling with every single political issue that comes up  in every country where cricket is played.   

 I mean it doesn’t matter which country, cricketing country, you reflect on there  are always political issues in those countries, even in, you know, Britain, or in 

 

 New  Zealand,  I  mean,  there  are  always  political  issues,  and  typically  cricket   administrators  won’t  want  to  become  involved  in  those  issues  and  sports   administrators  generally  don’t  want  to  and  shouldn’t.   But  there  are   circumstances which we could only describe as extreme circumstances. 

 There  were  boycotts,  sports  boycotts  of  South  Africa  during  the  Apartheid   years.   Why?  Because at the end of the day people felt that Apartheid was so  reprehensible as to merit some sanctions of that kind. 

 In the case of Zimbabwe we have a President who’s stolen an election, who has  trashed  democratic  institutions  and  has  done  worse  than  that.   He’s  a  man   through  his  policies  has  destroyed  the  agricultural  foundations  of  the  country   and left half the population suffering from food shortages and malnutrition. 

 Zimbabwe is running out of oil.  It doesn’t produce its own oil, but running out  of oil supplies because it doesn’t have the foreign exchange to pay for them, and  President Mugabe has reduced the Zimbabwean economy to an appalling state,  and  given  the  consequences  for  the  people  of  Zimbabwe  of  the  policies  of   President  Mugabe  and  his  undemocratic  approach  to  power,  in  those   circumstances  I  think  it  would  be  very  beneficial  if  the  International  sports   community did make a strong statement. 

 QUESTION:  You  say  that  it  would  be  a  propaganda   [indistinct]  given   Australia has been leading [indistinct] would it be a propaganda win for you to  have [indistinct]? 

 MINISTER  DOWNER:  No,  well  I  mean  I  don’t  think  we  need  a  propaganda   win.  I mean our government and Australia, you know, we stand or fall on our  democratic  principles.   Everybody  knows  in  this  country  we’ve  got  to  an   election in whatever - two, two and a half years’ time - as part of the political  cycle,  and  there’s  no  challenge  to  our  democratic  institutions  and  our   democratic  processes,  and  to  freedom  of  speech  and  public  debate  in  this   country, and we’re not looking for any propaganda wins to try to shore up our  system or anything like that.   We’re just looking for - we’re not looking for a  win  really,  we’re  just  looking  for  a  strong  statement  of  principles  here  and  an   international community which can say, look, enough is enough in Zimbabwe.    President  Mugabe’s  behaviour  just  goes  beyond  the  point  that  anybody,  any   reasonable person would regard as acceptable. 

 I  mean  it’s  not  even  debatable,  it’s  just  completely  unacceptable.     There  are   arguments we have with a lot of countries a lot of the time, but I mean usually  these arguments are entirely debatable, but in the case of President Mugabe he’s 

 

 just gone that one step too far and I’m afraid his behaviour, his performance, is  quite  unacceptable.   It  does  not  meet  the  norms  of  the  Commonwealth,  it   doesn’t  meet  the  norms  of  the  international  community,  and  I  think  a  very   strong statement needs to be made. 

 QUESTION:  Wouldn’t  it  set  a  dangerous  precedent  though  if  the   cricketers didn’t go …? 

 MINISTER  DOWNER:  I  don’t  think  it  sets  a  dangerous  precedent.   I  mean   there  are  precedents  already  where  sports  events  have  been  moved  from   countries  which  have  just  gone  too  far,  and  the  best  example  of  that  is  the   Apartheid South Africa. 

 I mean, you know, that was debated in Australia very much, very fiercely at the  time,  the  sports  boycotts  against  South  Africa,  but  in  the  end  countries  like   Australia,  New  Zealand,  Britain,  in  the  end  they  decided  that  those  kinds  of   boycotts probably were worthwhile and I think they did help to contribute to the  collapse of Apartheid.  There were a lot of other factors, by the way, that did,  but  they  helped  and  I  think  in  this  case  we  very  much  hope  that  the  smart   sanctions we and a number of other countries have introduced and a strong stand  on some of these issues which get to the heart of people like sports, it will help  to get rid of President Mugabe’s regime. 

 QUESTION: What other countries …? 

 MINISTER  DOWNER:  Well  I’ve  indicated  that  Britain  will.    I’d  hope  that   New Zealand would.  I’d be confident that New Zealand would.   And I think - I  don’t want to get into too long a list - I think though that we should  be able to  get two or three others beyond that, but we’ll just have to wait and see. 

 QUESTION: On an another issue [indistinct]… 

 MINISTER DOWNER: Well I think the trouble with this campaign to set fire  to  detention  centres  apparently  being  conducted  by  detainees  is  completely   counter-productive. 

 You have a situation - let’s just try to understand what the facts are here - in the  detention  centres  within  Australia  there  are  now  only  four  detainees  who   haven’t  had  a  primary  decision  made  on  their  refugee  application.     In  other   words, all but four have been found not to be refugees and the vast majority of  them  have  not  only  had  their  primary  determination  by  the  Department  of  

 

 Immigration,  and  those  primary  determinations  have  rejected  their  refugee   applications,  that  they’ve  been  the  courts  and  exhausted  all  of  the  legal   processes  available  in  Australia  and  have  been  found  by  the  courts,  by  the   Refugee  Review  Tribunal,  by  the  Department  of  Immigration,  not  to  be   refugees. 

 So  here  are  people  who  are  in  Australia  illegally.   They  have  broken  our  law,   they have circumvented, endeavoured to circumvent our immigration laws, and  they have refused when found not to be refugees to return to their own countries  which they should do.  They should immediately return to their own countries.   They insist on staying in Australia.  They’ll remain in the detention centres until  they  leave  where  they’ve  been  found  not  to  be  refugees  and  exhausted  all   possibilities, which most of them have, and to then turn around and commit acts  of  violence,  which  are  totally  against  the  grain  in  this  country,  and  to  break   Australian law, it just hardens people’s attitudes in Australia. 

 I mean there is no excuse for this intolerable behaviour. 

 QUESTION: Given that situation it’s likely we’re going to see more copy  cat  fires.   I  mean  this  is  just  maybe  the  first  in  series  of  fires  if  they’ve  got   nowhere else to go or nothing else to do. 

 MINISTER  DOWNER:  No,  but  look,  these  are  people  who  have  applies  for   refugee status in Australia and have been found not to be refugees in all cases  except four.   In four cases the applications haven’t been fully processed by the  Department,  but  in  all  of  the  other  cases  they  have  at  least  had  a  primary   determination and in most cases they have exhausted all of the legal appeals that  are available in Australia, and that is in most cases. 

 So in these circumstances these are people who are not found to be, who have  been  found  not  to  be  refugees,  these  are  people  who  have  been  found  to  be   illegal  migrants.   They’ve  been  endeavouring  to  get  into  our  country  illegally,   and when people try to come to our country illegally we ask them to leave.    

 We do like migrants coming to Australia.  We welcome migrants in our country.   We certainly accept refugees when they’re genuine refugees, but if people try to  come  illegally  well  that’s  something  we  discourage  and  for  them  then  to  turn   around and set fire to the detention centre it only compounds their problems. 

 QUESTION:  Mr  Downer,  you’ve  described  it  as  a  campaign,  you’re   saying it’s been planned and … 

 

 MINISTER DOWNER: No, I’m not sure [indistinct].   I was really answering a  question as to whether it were a copy cat campaign was put to me.   You know,  I’m  not  aware  of  all  the  details  of  how  it’s  been  managed,  but  I  mean  a   reasonable person could be excused for coming to the conclusion that this isn’t a  coincidence, that these fires have broken out in several detention centres over a  period of two days. 

 QUESTION: Of the four, which … 

 MINISTER  DOWNER:  No  I  don’t  know  the  answer  to  that.   No,  I  can’t  tell   you.   Nor can I tell whether they’re all in the one, and I’m not accusing those  four people of having been responsible for the fires.  They couldn’t possibly be  responsible for all the fires. 

 

 QUESTION:  Given  that  situation  then  is  it  possible  we  need  to  look  at    [indistinct] … more rapidly so that they can be …? 

 MINISTER DOWNER: Well, I mean, you know, they, we have only so many  courts in Australia, a very high percentage of cases before the Federal Court are  cases where people are appealing against decisions made by the Department of  Immigration and the Refugee Review Tribunal, but I mean, you know, there are  legal  processes  people  can  follow,  but  you  know,  one  has  to  follow  them.   I   mean  we’re  not  -  should  we  give  precedence  to  illegal  migrants’  appeals  over   the  normal  course  of  legal  work  that  courts  have  to  deal  with  for  Australians   here in Australia.   I think the answer is that it would be done in the normal way,  not set up something new just to accelerate one particular legal issue. 

 QUESTION:  Just  on  North  Korea,  what’s  the  latest  (have  the  inspectors   left)…? 

 MINISTER  DOWNER:  Oh  I  haven’t  heard  that  they’ve  actually  left  yet.   I   think that they’re expected to leave today, today or tomorrow.   Again, I mean I  can  only  repeat  what  we’ve  said  all  along.    We  are  very  concerned  about  the   situation in North Korea, about the decision by the North Korean government to  expel  the  inspectors,  to  reopen  the  Yongbyon  nuclear  facility  which  is  a   plutonium producing facility.    

 It does raise the stakes very substantially of security in north-east Asia and we  hope  that  the  diplomatic  measures  that  are  being  taken  by  the  international  

 

 community  will  help  to  persuade  the  North  Korean  government  that  there’s   nothing to be gained from pursuing the policy they’re pursuing. 

 There is no gains for North Korea in pursuing this policy.  There’s no sympathy  for them.   I appreciate the stand taken by Russia because Russia and China are  of particular importance here given their historic links with North Korea, but the  Russians and the Chinese have made it clear they want the North Koreans to get  back into the mainstream of the international community.   

 We appreciate the position that those two governments are taking and I think all  of  us,  particularly  in  the  region  but  also  the  United  States  as  well  and  Russia   have to work as hard as we can to continue to persuade the North Koreans that  there’s nothing to be gained pursuing the policies they’re pursuing, but we’ll  

 just have to see how things evolve.   I mean we’ll have to take this step by step,  week by week, month by month. 

 QUESTION: Mr Downer, how long would Australia when it pursues this  diplomacy [indistinct] and would it be  [indistinct] 

 MINISTER  DOWNER:  Well  I  don’t  think  we  should,  you  know  -  how  I   answer that question determines where our diplomacy is at, and so my answer to  that  question  is  that  we  take  this  step  by  step  and  I  very  much  hope  that  the   approach we’re taking now will be sufficient, and that is a policy of so called no  rewards, that is that North Korea will not be rewarded for bad behaviour.  The  opportunities  it  has  of  building  its  economy,  of  getting  more  foreign  aid,   developing trade opportunities.  They are [indistinct] for as long as it continues  to pursue the sort of security policy that it’s pursuing in defiance of international  norms,  in  breach  of  its  obligations  under  the  Nuclear  Non-proliferation  Treaty   almost certainly.   

 There’s  nothing  to  be  gained  for  North  Korea  in  doing  this.   I  hope  they’ll   realise  that  and  recognise  this  is  the  wrong  approach,  and  anything  over  and   above that, well, you know, we’ll just have to wait and see. 

 QUESTION:  Dr  Clezy  [inaudible],  the  South  Australian  doctor  who   managed to escape that shooting at all …? 

 MINISTER DOWNER: Yes, some  of  our  diplomats  have  -  we  have  been   looking  into  it,  yeah.    There  were  two  Australian  doctors  who  were  in  the   hospital  at  the  time  when  the  terrorist  attack  took  place  and  the  American  

 

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 9

 doctors  were  killed.   The  understanding  we  have  from  a  phone  conversation   with one of the doctors is that, one of the Australian doctors, is that the terrorists  specifically  targeted  the  Americans  there.   Obviously  a  very  frightening   experience  and  I  understand  the  two  Australian  doctors  are  going  to  return  to   Australia very soon.   I can understand that.   ENDS
