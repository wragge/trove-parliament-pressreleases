 Australia's Humanitarian Programme Helps Women at Risk 

 25 July 2006 

 In the last financial year nearly 1000 vulnerable women and children found refuge in  Australia through our Humanitarian Programme - with 995 refugees entering on Women at  Risk visas.  

 The annual target for Women at Risk is set nominally at 10 percent of the refugee intake.  Last year’s outcome came in at 16.5 percent - the largest since the category was  introduced in 1989.  

 “I’m very pleased we have far exceeded our target for assisting vulnerable women and  children,” Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, said.  

 “We know that women and children are the most vulnerable refugee group. They can be  discriminated against, threatened and abused and they often have no means of protecting  themselves and their children.  

 Last year was a very successful year for Australia’s Humanitarian Programme, with 14,122  visas granted - the highest number under this Coalition Government.  

 The humanitarian component catered for 8100 and the refugee component 6022. Overseas  applications accounted for 12,758 and 1364 to those granted onshore protection.  

 “ Australia is committed to resettling refugees in the most vulnerable situations, especially  those who have spent periods in refugee camps,” Senator Vanstone said.  

 “The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has determined that they  are those most in need of resettlement. We can all be proud that we have offered them a  chance to rebuild their lives.  

 “Since the Coalition Government came to power, well over 120,000 refugees and  humanitarian entrants have been resettled in Australia.”  

 Australia ’s Humanitarian Programme mainly comprises people from Africa, the Middle East  and South and South-east Asia. In 2005-06, 1118 visas were granted to Burmese people  from the Thai-Burma border, Malaysia and India.  

 “We remain in the top three resettlement countries in the world. We can all be very proud of  this achievement,” Senator Vanstone said.  

 The Government announced in May that Australia’s Humanitarian Programme for 2006-07  would include 13,000 new places.
