 MEDIA RELEASE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER  

 FA079           20  July  2006  

 

 DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT - AMBASSADOR FOR COUNTER-TERRORISM   

 I announce today the appointment of Mr Mike Smith as Australia’s Ambassador for Counter-Terrorism.  He will replace Mr Les Luck, who has been Ambassador since August 2003.   Mr Smith takes up his position immediately. 

 

 The position of the Ambassador for Counter-Terrorism reflects the continuing high priority  the Government attaches to fighting terrorism at home and in our region.  It has also enhanced  the wide range of bilateral, regional and multilateral measures already taken by the  Government since the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States.     

 As part of the 2006/07 budget, the Government has provided an additional $92.6 million  dollars over the next four years to boost Australia’s capacity to work with regional partners to  combat the continuing and evolving threat of terrorism.     

 The Ambassador for Counter-Terrorism is responsible for the development and  implementation of Australia’s international counter-terrorism policy.  The Ambassador has a  key role in ensuring a coherent and effective approach to Australia’s counter-terrorism  cooperation with both regional and extra-regional partners.  This entails identifying needs and  opportunities for practical action to counter the terrorist threat and maximising Australia’s  capacity to respond to these internationally.     

 As Chair of the Government’s International CT Coordination Group, the Ambassador for  Counter-Terrorism will work closely with an array of Australian agencies to ensure that  Australia’s considerable national capacities are brought to bear against our offshore  vulnerabilities.     

 Mr Smith was most recently Australia’s Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the  United Nations in Geneva.  Prior to taking up this position in April 2002, Mr Smith served as  Chief of Staff, Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (1998 - 2002).   

 Mr Smith has held a number of overseas positions including Ambassador to Egypt (1995-98),  Minister (Political), Australian Embassy,Washington (1993-95), Ambassador to Algeria  (1989-91) and Counsellor, Australian Permanent Mission to the UN, Geneva (1986-89).  In  Canberra he has served in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as Legal Adviser and  Assistant Secretary, Refugees, Immigration and Asylum (1991-93) and as Head of the  Multilateral and Humanitarian Legal Section (1984-86).      

 Mr Smith was born in Adelaide in 1949.  He speaks Arabic and French.  He holds a Bachelor  of Laws degree from Adelaide University and is married with two adult children.
