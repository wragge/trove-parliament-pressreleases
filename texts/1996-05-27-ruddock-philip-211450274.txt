 GOVERNMENT ACTS ON UNAUTHORISED BOAT ARRIVALS

 The Government has taken firm action in the past fortnight to remove 357 boat people  who have no claims on Australia's international obligations the Minister for Immigration  and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock announced today.

 "Between the 5th and the 10th of May there were four unauthorised boat arrivals on  Christmas Island, carrying a total of 244 people. On the morning of 26 May, the last of  those arrivals were returned to China," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Over the past two weeks, a further 113 people have been repatriated to China, under  the Memorandum of Understanding signed with China, in January last year."

 "This Government takes its international humanitarian obligations very seriously.  However, none of the recent returnees engaged those obligations and as required  under the Migration Act, they were removed as soon as practicable."

 "The returns are a clear illustration of this Government's determination to ensure that  the integrity of our borders is not compromised by those attempting illegal  immigration."

 The Minister recognised the co-operation of the Government of the Peoples' Republic  of China in the return of these people, to their homes.

 "Regional co-operation on matters relating to illegal immigration is essential in  addressinq what is. an issue facinq manv countries worldwide."

 "If people have no authority to come to Australia, and do not engage our protection  obligations, they are not welcome and will not be allowed to remain," Mr Ruddock said.
