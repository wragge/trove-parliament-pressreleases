 Gary Hardgrave MP   Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs 

   Media Release H73/2003 - 27 May 2003

 

 Refugees to Help Build Sustainable Regional Communities

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, today launched the  report on the Review of Settlement Services for Migrants and Humanitarian Entrants which  recommended that refugees arriving in Australia be encouraged to settle in regional  Australia in order to address the demand for less skilled labour in regional economies and to  help humanitarian entrants achieve early employment.

 "The settlement of refugees in regional Australia will be enhanced through improvements to  the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs' (DIMIA) planning of  settlement services, including the development of a stronger regional needs-based planning  framework, supported by better data and increased community consultation," Mr Hardgrave  said.

 "Managed effectively and supported with the right services, this strategy will help to build  sustainable regional communities."

 The review also recommends that funding levels for community grants should reflect better  the cost of delivering work programs in rural and regional areas. 

 In addition, it recommends that DIMIA broaden the eligibility for grants to encourage more  innovative and flexible service delivery arrangements that make better use of existing  infrastructure, particularly in regional areas.

 The Minister thanked the many community organisations, individuals and government  agencies that contributed to the review through written submissions and participation in  consultations. 

 He also thanked those who commented on DIMIA's June 2002 exposure paper, Supporting  Settlement in Rural, Regional and Remote Australia. 

 "The initiatives proposed by the review will assist in the continued development of our  regional communities. They will enhance settlement services in rural and regional Australia  and help migrants and humanitarian entrants share in the wealth of this nation and the  opportunities this country presents," said Mr Hardgrave.
