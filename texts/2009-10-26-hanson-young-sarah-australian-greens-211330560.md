 Sarah Hanson-Young   Lift Your Game Senators - It's Time For A Proper  Debate   Media Release | Spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young

 in Human Rights & Justice Detention Centres Immigration Refugees   

 Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young has called on the Senate to lift the standard of debate on asylum seekers in 

 Federal Parliament and avoid a repeat of the ugly language used in the past week. 

 Senator Hanson-Young, Green spokesperson on Immigration and Human Rights, will introduce a motion in the 

 Senate today (Monday) acknowledging the role of Senators as community leaders and their responsibility to 

 conduct debate in a respectful and accurate manner.  

 "For the past week we have watched our political leaders and other members of the House of Representatives 

 discuss this important issue,'' Senator Hanson-Young said. 

 "Sadly, many have produced an unacceptably low standard of debate, with slurs and untruths about asylum 

 seekers hurled across the chamber and across the airwaves. The Senate can do better.'' 

 "Australians have moved past the dark days of the Tampa and most people understand the need for compassion 

 and rational thinking when dealing with the needs of those asking for our help and protection. 

 "Attempts to claim political mileage from dog whistling fear and hatred will not sit well in the stomachs of 

 Australians who are thankful the days of children born and locked in desert prisons are over.'' 

 In the past week, we h



 ave seen our Prime Minister refer to asylum seekers as "illegals,'' a Northern Territory MP 

 describe them as "scum'', and Liberal Federal MP Wilson Tuckey even insinuate that they are terrorists. 

 "Offensive and provocative language and name calling are not helpful when we are trying to debate a politically 

 difficult issue,'' Senator Hanson-Young said. 

 "We need some maturity from our leaders as we seek out new and lasting solutions to the problem of worldwide 

 people movement. 

 "It is a problem that is not going away - let's agree to clearly state our cases about Australia's response but 

 without sinking to the sort of debate we have seen in the last week.''
