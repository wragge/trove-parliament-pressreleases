 More Boats As Coalition Negativity Continues   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said the latest asylum seeker boat arrivals are further proof of the  consequences of the Coalition’s failure to act in the national interest on border protection.   

 The asylum seeker boats, carrying 99 and 156 passengers, are the 17th and 18th boats since  Tony Abbott refused to cooperate with the Government to prevent people from risking their  lives on dangerous boat journeys to Australia.    

 “While the obstructionist Coalition tries to deflect the blame for these boat arrivals, we all  know that what people smugglers are really taking advantage of is Tony Abbott’s negativity  - his addiction to saying no,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he should stop the cheap and simple  quotes and work with the Government to implement offshore processing instead of blocking  it.”   

 Mr Clare said Mr Abbott agreed that offshore processing was the most effective way to stop  people making a dangerous journey but was standing in the way for his own political  purposes.    

 “It’s time for the Coalition to stop standing in the way of the Malaysian Agreement,” Mr  Clare said.   

 “It’s time for Tony Abbott to stop saying no and pass our legislation to allow offshore  processing in Malaysia and Nauru.”
