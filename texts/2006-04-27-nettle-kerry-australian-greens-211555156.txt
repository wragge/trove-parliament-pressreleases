 Senator Kerry Nettle  Senator for New South Wales 

 

 Over 20 years of detention for group of 27  wrongfully detained individuals   

 Senator Nettle, 27th April 2006 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today has called on all parties to support The Australian  Greens policy for the end the mandatory detention of asylum seekers in light of further  news of mistaken detention of 27 individuals by the Department of Immigration. 

 In an answer to a question on notice from Senator Nettle the department yesterday  released details of the extra 27 wrongfully detained individuals which came to light  during Senate Estimates in February this year. 

 "The Immigration compliance system is dangerously damaged. This latest list of 27  mistakenly detained individuals makes it 249 cases that have come to light since the  Cornelia Rau scandal broke the silence in 2005," Senator Nettle said. 

 "Since last June the Ombudsman has only been able to report on one of 247 cases of  mistaken detention. The Minister should provide more resources to speed this urgent  process up. 

 "I asked the Minister what resources have been provided to the Ombudsman back in  February but have not yet received and answer. 

 "The Immigration compliance system in this country is being exposed as a disaster area.  The public needs to have its confidence in this system restored which will not happen  whilst these horror stories are left undealt with. 

 "One man in this latest list was wrongly detained for nearly a year then released and  subsequently mistakenly detained for another three years - that is simply appalling."
