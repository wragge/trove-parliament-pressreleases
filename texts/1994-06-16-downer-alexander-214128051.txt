 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  ALEXANDER DOWNER MP  GEORGE ST, SYDNEY

 Topics: Labor Party Special Interest Groups, Multicultural!sm. Constitution, Immigration

 E & OE

 Downer: Firstly in relation to Gary Johns. Mr Johns has made it  clear that the Labor Party is a Party of special interest groups  and is out of touch with mainstream Australia.

 A Minister - a Minister in the Keating Government - has come out  directly and attacked the Prime Minister and his policies as  being policies for special interest groups, not policies for  mainstream Australia.  Mr Johns is right. Mr Johns is saying what 

 I'm saying. The Liberal Party is the Party of mainstream 

 Australia. Labor is only interested in deals for special interest  groups.

 Mr Johns is the second Minister in the last few days to come out  and attack his own Government to show divisions within the Labor  Party - to show that the present Government is beginning to come  apart at the seams in the face of a very different political  environment.

 We had Duncan Kerr criticising the Government's privatisation  program, now we have Gary Johns coming out and attacking the  Labor Party for being a Government of special interest groups,  not a government for all Australians.

 Jrnlst: Mr Downer, what can the Coalition do to draw support  from voters from the Asian region away from the ALP?

 Downer:  Well, first of all, the Coalition Is unambiguously  committed to a non-discriminatory immigration policy. We will  never support a disci,iminatory immigration policy.

 The Coalition supports a multicultural Australia. It supports  cultural diversity in Australia and we will, well I have today,  have been reinforcing those points at my lunch with leaders of  the Chinese community.

 Jrnlst: How will you turn around, though, that trend of support  towards the ALP?

 Downer: Australians of Asian origin,  I think,  will increasingly  recognise that it was Coalition governments that broke down the  White Australia Policy. It was Coalition governments that  welcomed Indo-Chinese refugees in the face of criticism and  opposition from the Labor Party.

 It, was the Fraser Government that advanced the notion of  multicultural ism and we remain committed to multicultural ism and  we remain totally committed to a non-discriminatory immigration  policy. ,

 The other thing I'd say is simply this. The Asian communities  in Australia are entrepreneurial, dynamic,  nation-building  people.  They make an immense contribution to this country. They  are. people who are naturally entrepreneurial.  They are people  whose philosophy of life is much more in line with the philosophy  of the Liberal Party than the philosophy of the Labor Party.

 Jrnlst:  Wouldn’t your stand on the republic and on the monarchy  though, alienate Asians?

 Downer: Look, so many Asians came to Australia to find political  stability. The reason that the Indo-Chinese refugees came to  Australia was to seek stability and security. Our constitution  has given us stability and security and the last thing that 

 migrants who have come to Australia in the last 30 or 40 years  want to see is a constitutional upheaval in this country.   Symbols are one thing but stability and security in a political  sense, that is everything to people who have come to this country 

 to find security.

 Jrnlst: Mr Downer, Mr Keating says that the Australian 

 constitution was the brainchild of the British Foreign Office so  that they could keep an eye on Australian politics. What's your  reaction?

 Downer: Mr Keating doesn't know anything about the history of  Australia. The Australian constitution was conceived by  Australians.  It was negotiated amongst Australians.  It was  approved by the voters of Australia, by the people of Australia 

 and it is an Australian document.

 The British Foreign Office didn't write the Australian 

 constitution.  The founding fathers of Australia wrote the  Australian constitution. It is a unique constitution. It is  uniquely conceived and It is a national document voted on by the  Australian people, approved by the Australian people.

 The Australian constitution is unambiguously an Australian  constitution.

 Jrnlst: ... (Inaudible) ...

 Downer: Well Mr Keating hasn't passed a history test since he's  been Prime Minister. He's a man who distorts and invents history  in order to try to make a political point.

 The political point he wants to make is that it's about time we  tore apart our constitution and had a great national upheaval  over constitutiona1 reform.

 Well my message is a simple one. It is about time we returned  this country to a bit of stability and a bit of commonsense.

 We've built on the strengths of our constitution and we made sure  that our government focused on getting people back to work, on  reducing foreign debt and creating greater security for families  because that's what Australians want. Not a Prime Minister 

 raging around like a bull in a china shop trying to rewrite the  Australian constitution.

 Jrnlst: Mr Downer, despite, what you say about the natural  constituency of the Liberal Party being people from the Asian  region, and the Coalition's initiatives in the past for those  people, the trend still is towards the ALP.

 What are you doing .. (inaudible) .. to address that?

 Downer: Well look I don't for a minute doubt that we have not  done as well with the Aslan vote over the last decade as we 

 should have done. I'm not walking away from that. I'm the first  to admit that. I'm making a point though that philosophically,  the Liberal Party is much more the Party for Asian Australians  than the Labor Party.

 The Liberal Party is a Party of entrepreunership, the Party of  incentives, the Party that gives the individuals the opportunity  to build up their own lives, create businesses and create  prosperity.

 The Labor Party is all about things which many people in the  Asian community would find, in my view, quite unpalatable.

 I mean, w e ’ve got Mr Johns today, Mr Johns is saying that the  Labor Party has become the Party of special interest groups, but  it's ignored mainstream Australia. He's dead right. He's dead  right. And I would have thought that all Australians would take  note of what the Special Minister of State has said about his own  government.

 Jrnlst: Mr Downer, ... (inaudible) ... immigration policy is  going to be?

 Downer: Sorry?

 Jrnlst:  Your immigration policy?

 Downer: Well, we're unambiguously going to have a non- 

 discriminatory immigration policy, and clearly, we will have an  immigration program.  There's no guestion of that.

 You need to remember I ’m the son of an Immigration Minister who  brought a large number of migrants to this country from all over  the world. I'm very proud of what Liberal governments have done  in the years gone by to bring migrants to Australia. To give  those people a safe refuge in many cases and we will continue to  carry on those traditions.

 Jrnlst:  Why have you downgraded the immigration portfolio?

 Downer:  I haven’t actually because the portfolio of 

 Multicultural Affairs is my responsibility and Senator Short is  the Shadow Minister assisting me on Multicultural Affairs.

 So, in relation to Multicultural Affairs, 1 have upgraded the  portfolio and upgraded the responsibility for Multicultural  Affairs from a Shadow Minister to the Leader of the Party.

 Now that is a reflection of the view that I have which is that  the Coalition, whatever mistakes w e ’ve made in the past,  whatever  problems we've had in the past,  we must put all of that behind  us, make a fresh start and that means a fresh start with the  ethnic communities in Australia. And I ’m getting underway to do 

 that.

 Jrnlst: Mr Downer,  what do you say to criticisms that while your  father was a visionary, your views are too narrow?

 Downer: I would assume that was the view of a couple of 

 academics who I've never heard of and 1 doubt that I'm ever  likely to hear of again. I reckon I would know my father a.damn  sight better than a couple of academics.

 Jrnlst:  Mr Downer, there’s a perception in ethnic communities  though, that you have sidelined immigration affairs by taking Mr  Short from ... â   .

 Downer: ... Well it's a false perception because I'm not 

 sidelining immigration.  Immigration means a-lot'  to me as an  issue and it’s meant a lot to my family over the years. It's  always meant a lot to me and I will always give a great priority  to immigration and multicultural affairs. "

 And if people have said I have downgraded multicuitural affairs,  in particular, the answer to that is there" might be a perception  but it’s wrong. What is true is I've upgraded it and given 

 myself that responsibility. "

 Jrnlst: ... a vote buying exercise by both Parties. What do you  think of that? .

 Downer: I don't think multiculturalism should be a vote buying  exercise.  I think multiculturalism should be about diversity  within one nation. And J can tell you I celebrate the diversity  that we have in Australia. Long may it last and long may this 

 country become an increasingly diverse country under one set of  laws.
