 Topic/s: 500th illegal boat arrival under Labor 

 Michael Keenan

 Today marks another very grim milestone in the tragedy of Labor’s border protection failures since they came to office.  The arrival of the 500th illegal boat, bringing over 29,000 people to Australia is an indication to the extent of Labor’s failure  on this issue. The most galling part of this is that none of this needed to have happened, apart from the fact that the Labor  Party thought they could change the robust system of border protection that they inherited from the previous government  that had stopped people smuggling. It was those decisions that were taken in 2008 that reinvigorated people smuggling  and led to this flood of illegal arrivals that we are seeing at the moment. In the last week alone, in just one week, we have  seen 15 boats arrive illegally in Australia. That is an average of two a day. If you put that into context, in the last six years  of the Howard Government, we had 18 boats arrive illegally, which was on average three  boats arrive a year. During that  time whenever a boat arrived illegally in Australia, Julia Gillard said that that was a significant policy failure. She has  presided over, as Prime Minister, more illegal boat arrivals then everybody else combined in history. She has presided  over the complete collapse of the government’s control over who comes to our country. This litany of failure has come at  an enormous cost to the Australian tax payer, to the safety of the people who are smuggled down here and to the integrity  of our immigration system. On average a boat that arrives illegally here in Australia costs the Australian tax payers $12  million. So if you are getting 15 boats arriving in one week you are talking about another $180 million cost to the tax payer.  Of course it is all the tragedy that is encouraged by the fact that people think that this is a way that they can come here to  Australia and the lives that have been lost attempting what is still remains to be a very perilous journey. The Labor Party’s  failure on this issue is complete. They are now the problem. People smugglers have tested them time and time again and  time and time again they have blinked. That is why, while they remain in office, people smugglers will remain in charge  over who comes to Australia.

 Journalist

 The political climate around the world has changed a lot since now and the time that you are referring to, do you think that  this can solely be attributed to policy?

 Michael Keenan 

 It absolutely has. That used to be a Labor Party excuse to say that the international climate had changed but that is just  not the case. Afghanistan was occurring during those Howard years and so was that vicious civil war in Sri Lanka. It is not  the international environment that changed it is Australia’s policies. The decisions that were made in Canberra led to this  flood of illegal arrivals. The international climate around us has been volatile for many decades. It wasn’t that that led to  this influx of illegal arrivals. It was the decisions the Labor Party took to abolish the tough but necessary measures the  Howard Government had put in place to stop people smugglers. 

 Journalist

 We do have offshore processing now though and I guess it remains to be seen whether that will make a dent?

 Michael Keenan

 We would like the return to offshore processing on Nauru and Manus Island to work but there is no evidence that it is at  the moment. It really needs to be done in conjunction with the full suite of measures that the Howard Government used.  That is a return to temporary protection visas, which is vitally important because the product the people smugglers are  selling is permanent residence to Australia, and we also need to turn the boats back around when it is safe to do so. Julia  Gillard used to support this policy. It used to be the Labor Party’s policy but they  haven’t had the courage or the resolve to  implement it in government but that again is a very important measure that the Howard Government used to show people  smugglers that they were deadly serious about stopping them. 

 Journalist

 So is that the answer then to just go back to the policies of a decade ago?

 Absolutely. The reason we are in this mess is because those policies were changed. If those policies weren’t changed  then we wouldn’t have had this reinvigorated people smuggling trade. You can see that as soon as the policies were  changed in August of 2008, boats had stopped coming prior to that, in September of 2008 the people smugglers went  back into business. It was these policies that really provided the impetus for people smuggling to start again and it was  because those policies were abolished that has led to this situation and if they weren’t abolished then we wouldn’t be in it.

 Journalist

 You are making it sound like temporary protection visas are the crucial factor as opposed to the move to Nauru? Tony  Abbott spent a long time urging the Government to resurrect the Nauru solution, so are you now suggesting that that was  only a small piece of the puzzle and really the big part is the temporary protection visas policy?

 Michael Keenan

 Offshore processing is very important and it remains so but we always talked about a suite of measures that needed to be  embraced. Offshore processing is a vitally important part of that but it needs to be done in conjunction with temporary  protection visas and it needs to be done in conjunction with turning the boats back around when it is safe for us to do so. It  was a suite of policies that worked to stop people smuggling and we are not going to get the same results if we are going  to take a half hearted approach to it where we only embrace parts of that suite of policies. We need to embrace all of it  and if we embrace all of it then that would show the people smugglers that we are serious about regaining control over  who comes to Australia.

 Journalist

 You said that the product that the people smugglers are selling is residency in Australia. I mean many of these people are  genuine refugees, so really they deserve permanent residency in Australia if they can make it here. So really what they  are selling is passage to Australia isn’t it? So a change in policy in terms of visas, these people are still going to get  asylum if they’re genuine asylum seekers, so a change in visa policy isn’t going to stop unscrupulous people in Indonesia  from selling a ticket to Australia is it?

 Michael Keenan

 What they are selling is permanent residence in Australia. We will obviously continue to protect people, as is our  international obligation. What we say with temporary protection visas is that we will provided protection to you as long as  you need it but if conditions within your homeland change, and obviously Sri Lanka is a very good example of this,  then  we would expect you to return home. So we are obligated to protect people and we should protect people when they need  that protection but it is not necessarily a permanent state, being a refugee, and when things change and they do we think  it is appropriate that you return home. If we were to implement that policy then it undermines what the people smugglers  are selling because they are selling out in the international community that they can get you permanent residence to  Australia and that is why temporary protection visas are so important.
