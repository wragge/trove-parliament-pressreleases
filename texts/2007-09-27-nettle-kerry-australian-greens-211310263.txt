 Excision of Australian territory from migration zone must  end 

 27th Sep 07 

 

 

 

 Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today called for the excision of Australian  territory from the migration zone to end as it contravenes Australia’s  responsibilities under the Refugee Convention.   

 "Revelations that the government returned five West Papuan asylum seekers to  PNG after holding them for a month contravenes our responsibilities under the  Refugee Convention," said Senator Nettle.   

 "Clearly these asylum seekers did not feel they had adequate protection in Papua  New Guinea and sought protection here. It is appalling that the government did  not assess their cases fairly and instead just sent them back to PNG.   

 "The excision of Australian territory from the Migration Zone is a ‘smoke a  mirrors trick’ that in now way lessens our obligations under the Refugee  convention.    

 "The Labor Party should commit to overturning the excision if it wins  government.   

 "By turning a blind eye to the plight of West Papua and refugees, Australia is  appeasing Indonesia and betraying the Papuans who helped our forces in World  War Two.
