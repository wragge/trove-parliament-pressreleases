 High Court judgement confirms Greens view of  Temporary Protection Visas 

 Senator Nettle, 15th November 2006  Australian Greens spokesperson on Immigration, Senator Kerry Nettle said that  today's High Court decisions confirm The Greens concerns with the Temporary  Protection Visa system.    

 "This decision confirms the power of the government under their harsh Temporary  Protection Visa scheme to deport people who have been recognised as refugees and  are trying to make new lives in Australia," Senator Nettle said.    

 "The Temporary Protection Visa system is cruel and must be scrapped.    

 "This government has always seen the issue of refugee protection as a legal issue, The  Greens recognise that it is a moral issue.    

 "Once a person who has fled their home is recognised as a refugee in Australia, The  Greens believe they should be allowed to start a new life on a permanent visa.    

 "Returning refugees to their home countries is fraught with danger. The recent report  by the Edmund Rice Centre on returned asylum seekers indicates that many face  renewed persecution and even death on return.    

 "The Greens agree with Justice Kirby's assessment that Australian law should support  international treaties, not undermine them.    

 "The Greens call again on the government and opposition to scrap their support for  the cruel Temporary Protection Visa scheme."
