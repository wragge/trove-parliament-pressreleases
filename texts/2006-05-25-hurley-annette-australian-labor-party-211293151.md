 'World Class' Services But No Way To Measure  Them! 

 Media Statement - 25th May 2006 

 It was revealed this week by DIMA officials in the Legal and Constitutional Senate Estimates  Committee that there is currently no way to accurately measure the Governments refugee  settlement services - a service that has been referred to as being world class by the  Government.   

 It clearly states in the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS) contract, written by  the Government, that Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and performance standards are  considered to be achieved if seventy five percent of entrants are satisfied   

 When DIMA officials were questioned on this by the ALPs Shadow Minister for Citizenship and  Multicultural Affairs, Sen. Annette Hurley, it was stated that DIMA does not have a  comprehensive method which clearly quantifies if 75% of clients are satisfied.   

 In the Estimates Committee Senator Hurley stated It amazes me that you have set out a KPI  but have no way to measure it. As a result of this a DIMA official said that she would consult  with her contract managers about the anomaly!   

 It was also revealed that DIMA does not survey its IHSS clients to assess whether 75% of them  are satisfied. This comes after the capability of one service provider to deliver its contractual  obligations has been seriously questioned.   

 On conclusion of the Estimates session Senator Hurley stated that it defies belief that, in a  contract which stipulates a provider must receive seventy five percent client satisfaction, the  Government has no plan to measure it.   

 The Australian National Audit Office has already criticised DIMAs management of its Detention  Centres contract* but the Department does not appear to have heeded that message in its  refugee settlement contract, she said.
