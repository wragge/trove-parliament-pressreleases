  Additional English training for refugees and humanitarian  entrants  Humanitarian entrants will benefit from additional and more flexible English language learning  arrangements as a result of extra funding for the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP), Philip  Ruddock, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs said today. 

  "English is the single most important skill for successful settlement in Australia," Mr Ruddock said. 

  "The $17.7 million of additional funding over four years will greatly increase the capacity of  humanitarian entrants to acquire basic English skills. The new funding will be in addition to the $91  million allocated to AMEP in this fmancial year. 

  "Today's announcement fulfills a pre election commitment of the Government and reflects the  Government's commitment to providing effective English language tuition to our refugee and  humanitarian entrants. 

  "Most of the additional funding will be directed at refugee and humanitarian entrants with special  learning needs. 

  "Special programs will be delivered for this client group in community settings in conjunction with  other local service providers and professionals. The programs will be delivered as a preparation for  the allocated tuition provided through AMEP. 

  "They will develop participants' skills in learning English and will enable them to more effectively  participate in formal learning arrangements." 

  "Around $500000 will be used to expand the role ofthe Home Tutor Scheme. This will enable the  Scheme to further support community agencies providing informal English as a Second Language  tuition. Support will include; training for volunteer tutors, providing access to resources and advising  on curriculum and other teaching issues. 

  "This new role for the Home Tutor Scheme will contribute to strengthening links between mainstream  and community-based providers of English as a Second Language. 

  "These initiatives are expected to be implemented early in the 1997/98 financial year."
