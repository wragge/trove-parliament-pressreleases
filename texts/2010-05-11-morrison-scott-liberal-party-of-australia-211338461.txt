 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship    Media Release 

 

 Welcome to Kevin and Wayne's asylum hotel 

 Tuesday 11th May 2010 

 The Rudd Government’s decision to spend $1.2 million to house 79 asylum seekers in a 4 

 star hotel in Brisbane is the consequence of their own failed border protection policies, 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today.  

 

 “The fact that asylum seekers have to be put in hotel accommodation in the Treasurer’s 

 Brisbane electorate, where it costs $179 a night, is what happens when there is no room left 

 on Christmas Island,” Mr Morrison said.  

 

 “Since Kevin Rudd started rolling back the strong border protection regime he inherited from 

 the Coalition, 122 boats have arrived carrying 5,624 people. Just yesterday we had two 

 more boats arrive, talking the annual total to 54. At the same time last year only twelve boats 

 had arrived,” he said.  

 

 “When the Coalition was faced with a surge in arrivals a decade ago, we also had to put 

 people up in motel accommodation. However, the difference is the Coalition Government did 

 something about stopping the boats. Under Kevin Rudd, the boats just keep coming, at great 

 risk to human life and at extraordinary expense to the Australian taxpayer.  

 

 “The Coalition’s policies in Government led to an average of three boats per year in our last 

 six years in Government. Under Kevin Rudd we have three boats arriving on average every 

 week. That is why we have people staying at taxpayer’s expense in hotels in the Treasurer’s 

 own electorate in Brisbane for at least six months.  

 

 “In Opposition the Treasurer opposed asylum seekers being sent to his electorate. Now In 

 Government he is putting them up there in hotels. It is another example of how this 

 Government said one thing in Opposition and has done another in Government.  

 

 “The cost of hotels is just one of the numerous expenses that are blowing out under Kevin 

 Rudd’s failed immigration and border protection policies, expected to be in the hundreds of 

 millions when announced later tonight.  

 

 “Kevin Rudd is chasing his tail on the spiralling costs of his failed asylum policies. As his own 

 policies continue to drive the demand for people to get on the boats, the costs to taxpayers 

 of coping with the surge in boat arrivals, continues to rise,” Mr Morrison said.
