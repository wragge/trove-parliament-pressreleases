 THE HON LUKE HARTSUYKER MP  Assistant Minister for Employment  Deputy Leader of The House  Federal Member for Cowper 

 

 Media Release 

 

 15 May 2015   

 Labor has no plan for youth unemployment   

 Assistant Minister for Employment Luke Hartsuyker said the Leader of the  Opposition failed to outline any plan to tackle youth unemployment in his Budget in  Reply speech last night.   

 “In what was supposed to be Labor’s year of ideas, the Leader of the Opposition did  not outline a single new idea to help young job seekers,” Mr Hartsuyker said.    

 “Last night we heard the Leader of the Opposition talk up big unfunded visions of the  future while at the same time failing to outline any practical measures to help young  job seekers here and now.   

 “Only the Coalition Government has a fully funded plan to help grow the economy  and create more jobs.   

 “The Growing Jobs and Small Business package announced in Tuesday’s Budget  will give small business more confidence to invest and grow their business and  employ more staff.   

 “It is the Abbott Government that has the plan to take the pressure off small  businesses through tax cuts, immediately deductable asset write offs and slashing  red tape. All of these changes will help build business confidence and create more  opportunities for job seekers.   

 “The Government also understands that some young job seekers need extra help to  get a foot in the door with an employer.   

 “That’s why the Government is investing $330 million in a Youth Employment  Strategy to help those young job seekers most at risk of long term unemployment.     

 “This includes the Transition to Work programme and new intensive support for  young job seekers most at risk, such as those with a mental illness.   

 “The Government’s new National Work Experience Programme will also help more  young job seekers get the sort of practical experience they need in a workplace so  they can show a potential employer that they are keen and willing to work.   

 “Our changes to wage subsidy arrangements will also help employers with the  upfront costs of hiring and training new staff.   

 “The changes announced in the Budget build on the Government’s existing support  for young job seekers including the Job Commitment Bonus, Relocation Assistance  and the new $6.8 billion jobactive employment service.    

 “Labor has no plan for youth unemployment. It is time they stopped the hoax, the  mirage and the smokescreen. If Bill Shorten was genuine in wanting to work  constructively with the Government then he would get on board with the 

 Government’s plan to help job seekers move from welfare into work,” Mr Hartsuyker  said.
