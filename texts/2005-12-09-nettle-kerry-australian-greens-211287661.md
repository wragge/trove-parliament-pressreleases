 Mandatory detention the real culprit  in Solon scandal   

 8.12.05 

 

 Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle welcomed the findings and  recommendations of the Senate Inquiry into the deportation of Vivian Solon  but said more fundamental reforms were necessary to stop such a scandal  happening again.   

 "While we have a system of mandatory detention, another Vivian Solon or  Cornelia Rau could happen.  Abolishing mandatory detention is the most  important step in reforming the Immigration Department," said Senator  Nettle.   

 "I met Vivian on her return to Sydney and was struck by her sad eyes. This  report is not just about bureaucratic incompetence, but about a human being  who was treated dreadfully by the Howard Government.   

 "Her story should be a warning to us all that human rights and human  welfare should always be the priority, regardless of a person's visa status.   

 "While The Greens agree with the recommendations contained in this report,  our additional comments urge legislative changes to ensure judicial oversight  of the Immigration Departments detention and deportation activities.   

 "The potentially unlawful detention of up to 220 other people still under  investigation by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, make it clear that the  Government's policy of mandatory detention is the real culprit."
