 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 

 Global trend on asylum applications defy Labor's border protection spin 

 Wednesday 24th March 2010 

 The release of new figures on global asylum applications by the UNHCR shows that 

 Australia is defying global trends, exposing Labor’s claims that push factors are responsible 

 for the surge in illegal boat arrivals as just more spin, Shadow Minister for Immigration and 

 citizenship, Scott Morrison said today. 

 

 “The UNHCR figures show that in 2009, Australia experienced a 29% increase in asylum 

 applications compared to a global average of 0%,” Mr Morrison said. 

 

 “Australia’s rate of growth in asylum applications was greater than in Germany, France, 

 USA, Canada, Italy, Spain, The Netherlands, Norway and the UK, where in many cases 

 asylum applications declined,” he said. 

 

 “Australia and the UK share seven of the top ten source countries for asylum applications, 

 namely Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and China. Yet in 2009 the 

 UK had a 5% decline, while Australia had a 29% increase. 

 

 “The Rudd Government has also made much of push factors from Sri Lanka. Yet in 2009 

 there was only a 4% increase globally in asylum applications from Sri Lankans. 

 

 “While the UNHCR figures show that globally there has been an increase in applications 

 from Afghans, this has been offset by even larger declines, in volume terms, in applications 

 by Iraqis.  

 

 “In Australia’s case we experienced an increase in applications from both Iraqis and 

 Afghans, despite the fact that neither source country is in our region. In the UK, applications 

 from Afghans declined during 2009. 

 

 “Under the Rudd Government’s policies Australia has become a destination of choice, acting 

 as a magnet for asylum seekers, who have turned up on 96 boats  since Mr Rudd started  

 rolling back the strong border protection regime. 

 

 “Today’s figures demonstrate that Mr Rudd cannot sustain his spin that boat arrivals in 

 Australia are driven by global push factors.  

 

 “Mr Rudd cannot spin the boats away. He must end his border protection denial and take 

 direct action to address the pull factors he has created which have resulted in 96 boats and 

 more than 4,300 people arriving by boat on his watch,” Mr Morrison said.
