 Green Funds Plundered to Build Island Detention Centre

 Environment spending cut $211m with 119 staff to go to fund Christmas Island detention centre.

 The unheralded $211 m cut in spending on Australia’s environment this financial year will almost exactly fund the huge detention centre (cost $219m) for refugees on Christmas Island, Greens Senator Bob Brown said today. There will be 119 jobs lost in the environment departments.

 “This involves a monumental backflip by the Prime Minister Mr Howard in his key election promise to fight the salinity devastating Australia’s rural areas. To rub salt into the environment cutbacks he has slashed $169 m out of the National Action Plan on Salinity over the next 4 years,” Senator Brown said.

 “And with Australia having become the world’s worst greenhouse gas polluter, Mr Howard has cut spending on greenhouse abatement by 50 percent this year and a total of $289 m over 4 years.

 “In an environmental absurdity, the government is putting $77m more into its diesel fuel rebate while spending $2.5 m to study why Australians are not converting to more environment-friendly fuels.

 “The $1m cut in funding for Tasmania’s World Heritage Wilderness is irresponsible and underscores the weakness of Dr Kemp’s environment ministry.

 “The $4.5 m allocated to this vast wilderness area is in stark contrast to the $10.5 m going to the Sydney Harbour National Park, part of which is in Mr Howard’s electorate of Bennelong and Mr Tony Abbott’s electorate of Warringah,” Senator Brown said.

 Environment cuts include: â 119 public servants taken from environment departments â $169.2M over four years from the National Action Plan on Salinity â $67.7M from the biodiversity budget not spent 2001/2

 â $289M slashed from Greenhouse gas abatement programs over 4 years (2001/2 - 2004/5) â $1M cut to World Heritage funding for Tasmania
