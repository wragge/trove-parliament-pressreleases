 Gary Hardgrave MP   Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs 

   Media Release H1/2003 - 16 January 2003

 

 Ruddock Breaks Record as Longest-Serving Immigration Minister

 Minister Ruddock will today set a new benchmark - as the longest-serving Immigration  Minister in Australia's history.

 The record of 2501 days was previously held by Harold Holt - Immigration Minister for three  consecutive Menzies Ministries from 19/12/49 to 24/10/56. 

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs Gary Hardgrave, congratulated Mr  Ruddock on his outstanding achievement.

 'There is no doubt that Philip Ruddock is the finest Immigration Minister this country has  ever had and his place in history is assured,' Mr Hardgrave said.

 'Minister Ruddock has overseen significant reforms to the migration program which have  delivered economic, social, and cultural dividends to the nation.'

 'He has faced enormous challenges to maintain Australia's border sovereignty during a  difficult time of unprecedented numbers of illegal arrivals to our shores.'

 'He is a very compassionate man who has a strong sense of justice and who has fought for  greater international cooperation to enable the protection system to deliver better outcomes  for genuine refugees.'

 'He has dedicated a great deal of time throughout his parliamentary career to Australia's  multicultural community and is the architect of many of the nation-building policies that unite  us today - his contribution spanning almost 3 decades.'

 'He is known as the Father of the House, being the longest serving MP, and later this year  will mark the 30th anniversary of his election to the Australian Federal Parliament.'

 'It is important to acknowledge the contribution also made to public life by his wife Heather  Ruddock, who has been a strong, supportive presence for over 30 years.'

 Mr Hardgrave said that in contrast to the stability provided by the Government, since Mr  Ruddock became Minister on 11 March 1996, there have been four Labor Shadow Ministers.  (Duncan Kerr (20/3/96 - 26/8/97); Martin Ferguson (26/8/97 - 20/10/98; Con Sciacca  (20/10/98 - 22/11/00); and Julia Gillard (25/11/01 - current). In the 13 years of the Hawke  and Keating Governments, there were seven Immigration Ministers.

 'I am sure many Australians will join me in congratulating him on his remarkable  achievement and I look forward to working with him for many years to come,' Mr Hardgrave  said.
