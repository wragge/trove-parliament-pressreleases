  FINAL VERSION

  SPEECH at LAUNCH OF GP’S MANUAL ON REFUGEE 
HEALTH AND GENERAL PRACTICE

  

  DR MICHAEL WOOLDRIDGE, MINISTER FOR HEALTH AND FAMILY SERVICES

  

  20 AUGUST 1998

  

  Dr  Vladmir Vizec, [Pron. VI-SEK] Father Peter Hosking [Chairperson, 
VFST], Councillor Sara Coward,   Mayor Maribyrnong City , Paris Aristotle, [Director, VFST] distinguished 
guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  

 I am delighted to join you here tonight and to launch 
this manual on Refugee Health and General Practice.

  

 I’m glad Vladmir mentioned that I was the Member 
for Chisholm, as well as the Minister for Health.

  

 The electorate of Chisholm I represent is well named 
after one of the great figures of Australian history. In fact, Caroline 
Chisholm was known by her contemporaries in mid-l9th century Australia 
as the “emigrants friend”.

  

 This well deserved title - one that is even inscribed 
on her tombstone - was earned from her work in the early nineteenth 
century when Caroline Chisholm used to go down to the wharves of Sydney 
and welcome newly arrived migrants to Australia. She even set up a series 
of houses in which migrants, far from their old homeland, could settle 
into their new one.

  

 It’s a tradition of welcome and hospitality that 
is not only alive and well in my electorate near here in which some 
one in four people were born overseas but is evident in this kit which 
has been prepared to help provide full and proper medical care to Australia’s 
newest arrivals.

  

 Since the Second World War Australia has welcomed 
some 600,000 people as refugees and of them, the Foundation for the 
Survivors of Torture estimates that as many as 150,000 people in our 
community have endured the horror of torture.

  

  

 So I could hardly be more delighted to join you tonight 
to launch this manual that will not only mean that many people whose 
lives are still profoundly affected by the trauma and suffering caused 
by torture will find medical care that suits them.

  

 This booklet also represents the best of the Australian 
tradition of welcome and hospitality to migrants that Caroline Chisholm 
represents and shows that it is alive and well in our community. This 
manual then is a sign of great hope that Australia is still a place 
of compassion. I say that because recently, the voices of a strident 
few and in particular the views of   Pauline Hanson’s One Nation Party  have come to the fore in 
Australia.

  

 Those views have reached new depths with the recently 
launched immigration policy in which the spurious claim is made that 
Australia’s refugee policies should be changed and that, at best, 
Australia should only be a temporary haven for refugees before they 
are sent back again when “things get better”. Those views are deeply 
flawed and dangerous.

  

 As Paris and any other counsellors at the Victorian 
Foundation for the Survivors of Torture and many of the GPs here will 
testify, creating uncertainty and insecurity as these views undoubtedly 
do is one of the most dangerous ways to add to the harm that torturers 
do.

  

 It is even well documented that in pursuing domination, 
regimes that practise torture deliberately set out to create a climate 
of fear and chronic alarm by removing any sense of safety or control 
from those they seek to oppress.

  

 The views and policies of One Nation would only continue 
the suffering of refugees who have been tortured and could well complete 
the insidious work that torture began.

  

 Moreover, the views of One Nation on refugees in particular 
and immigration in general are views I not only reject but they are 
views that the overwhelming majority of Australians repudiate and reject.

  

 Australia must and will remain true to its traditions 
of welcoming people who have fled to this country fearing persecution 
in their original homeland.

  

 We must not and will not turn our backs on those who 
come here for refuge.

  

  To do so would be to betray our moral obligation as a community and 
to betray that great Australian tradition of helping out those in need.

  

  It would also mean turning our back on the best o f our own 
history and overlooking the wonderful contribution migrants have made 
to the development of this country.

  

  Refugees in particular and migrants to Australia have overwhelmingly 
brought with them a commitment to make their new home a better place 
and to make what Australians value turn into reality. Australians hold 
as sacred values such as working hard, family  life and caring 
for those in genuine need.

  

 Many of those migrants and refugees have made enormously 
important contributions to Australian society in building up these basic 
values and in making Australia a community that is all the stronger 
for its diversity.

  

 Think, for instance, how much the richer Australia 
is for having an eminent medical scientist such as Gus Nossal. A world-class 
microbiologist, Gus came to Australia in 1939, at the age of seven, 
leaving behind his native Austria and the oppression of Nazism to come 
here.

  

 The ludicrous logic of One Nation’s policies would 
be that Gus should have been sent back to Austria

  

 The truth is that we need Gus both for his world class 
medical research that has directly saved lives and improved the health 
of countless people.

  

 We also need him for his humanity — shown by his 
vital contribution to ensuring the healing of that most long-standing 
rift in Australia, that between indigenous Australians and those of 
us who have migrated here in the last 210 years.

  

 It’s no coincidence that Gus Nossal is today the 
Deputy Chair of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation.

  

 To adopt One Nation’s policies would mean Australia 
would be turning our back on thousands of Gus Nossals and also on our 
proud record in welcoming refugees like him to this country.

  

 In 1945, when the US and Britain, were turning away 
Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, it was Australia, that then offered 
those people a home. In the 1970s, Australia welcomed proportionately 
more people from war torn Vietnam and from the killing fields of Cambodia 
than any other country in the world.

  

 We did it because it was the Australian thing to do: 
to stand by people when they were down and needed a hand and to help 
out your neighbour when in need. It’s an achievement of which we should 
be and are rightly proud. And it’s an achievement that lives on in 
a simple and practical way in this manual that is being launched tonight.

  

 This booklet is no panacea for human suffering. But 
in setting out in great detail ways GP can provide better medical care 
to refugees who’ve come to Australia, it expresses the compassion 
of a community that is committed to ensuring that Australia becomes 
their new home and the welcome of a community that is indebted to those 
who have fled here.

  

 It’s a manual, therefore, that shows that the tradition 
of compassion and welcome that Caroline Chisholm is remembered for is 
alive and well.

  

 To me, it is a manual of hope. The very thing that 
those who torture seek to destroy most is a persons sense of hope. They 
seek to put in its place anxiety and fear, and a pervasive sense that 
the world is threatening and dangerous.

  

 This booklet restores hope for it is ultimately based 
on the conviction that with skilled help the torturers work can be overcome 
and, in its place, with the right care, the resilience and courage of 
those who come here as refugees can overcome the worst that torturers 
subject their victims to.

  

 Healing is a slow but sure process and I'd like to 
congratulate and thank all those who put this manual together especially 
those who work at the Victorian Foundation of the Survivors of Torture 
and the doctors of the Western Division of General Practice who have 
taken the lead in preparing it.

  

 Already, I’m told, there’s been interest from 
other medical practitioners across Australia and from overseas. That’s 
a fresh and confirming sign that Australia can still hold its head high 
in the international community and that Australians can still be assured 
that we are a community which is still true to our values and the best 
of our traditions. It is a very great credit to the Western Melbourne 
Division of General Practice.

  

 But, finally, I’d like to especially acknowledge 
tonight those people in this hall who came to Australia as refugees 
and migrants.

  

  My father was a migrant and he also impressed on me that migrating 
to another country is at the best of times difficult. He had the advantage 
of marrying an Australian born citizen and having Mum’s family here 
to make him feel welcome and also he spoke En glish as his first 
language.

  

 The other day I told him a story about another function 
I spoke at last year when I was launching a new scheme whereby migrant 
and refugee families can gain help with child care.

  

 At this launch, a choir was assembled who sang the 
song “We are Australian”. It was as moving an experience as the 
WYPIN [  Western 
Young People's Independent Performance ] performance that we had 
earlier tonight.

  

  The choir comprised children from Afghanistan, Chile, Vietnam, Bosnia 
and Ethiopia- in oth er words, from virtually all the continents 
of the world - and even one child who had arrived in Australia from 
China just weeks before.

  

 It was wonderful to hear the words sung, “We come 
from far away...we come from all distant lands...I am, you are, we are 
Australian.” It was a great effort even just to learn the words, let 
alone sing them with such spirit. Yet perhaps the most remarkable aspect 
of that choir was that some of the children were refugees to Australia 
who have been tortured.

  

 Ironically, that song is regarded as   One Nation’s  theme song. Yet the truth is it’s only when 
everyone is accepted in this community, it’s only when everyone -whether 
they are one of the descendants of Australia’s original inhabitants 
or the son of migrant like me or a newly arrived refugee child- can 
sing this song that Australia will truly be One Nation.

  

 I’m particulary delighted tonight to honour two 
people who between them have clocked up some 80 years of service to 
the local community here in Melbourne’s West.

  

 Dr Igor Balabin who has worked for around 40 years 
in St Albans and Dr Zygmunt Kortus, a GP for around 40 years in Sunshine 
represent between them a lifetime of service to the community here.

  

 GPs are the cornerstone of our health system and the 
health care they provide is of immense benefit to the health of our 
community. I’m delighted to present them with these certificates as 
I am to officially declare this manual launched.
