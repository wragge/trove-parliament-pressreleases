 JOINT PRESS RELEASE   

 

 THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MP, PRIME MINISTER  THE HON. SCOTT MORRISON MP,   MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION   

 100 DAYS SINCE LAST SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE SMUGGLING OPERATION   

 Today marks 100 days since the last successful people smuggling venture to Australia.   

 The last successful people smuggling venture to Australia occurred on 19 December last year. During the  same 100 day period a year ago (20 December 2012 - 29 March 2013), 66 illegal boats carrying 3,879  people arrived.   

 This is the longest period without a successful venture since before the Howard Governmentâ€™s strong border  protection policies were abandoned by Labor and Kevin Rudd in August 2008.     

 The Coalition went to the last election with clear policies to stop the boats.  We are delivering on our pledge  to stop the boats.     

 The Government has made difficult but necessary decisions to secure our borders and restore what Labor  had destroyed.  These strong policies are saving lives.   

 Operation Sovereign Borders is working as intended.  We acknowledge the work and dedication of the  people and agencies across government in making this happen.  They are doing a great service for our  nation.   

 The people smugglers now understand that the way to Australia is closed. We are putting the smugglers out  of business.   

 Under Labor over 800 boats arrived carrying more than 50,000 people, including more than 8,000  children.  This catastrophic policy failure resulted in over 1,000 lives lost at sea and $11 billion in Budget  blowouts.   

 The progress we are making in strengthening our borders is restoring confidence in our migration  programme.  We are an immigrant country and a successful immigration programme requires that it operate  with integrity.     

 While this milestone recognises the progress that we have made, the Government remains resolute in our  determination to stop the boats.
