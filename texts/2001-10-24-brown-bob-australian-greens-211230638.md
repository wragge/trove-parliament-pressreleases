 Greens Launch Strongest Environment Policy

 The Greens today launched a breakthrough environment policy, “One World”, aimed at protecting and promoting Australia’s and the planet’s great environmental assets.

 “This is the strongest most advanced environment policy of any of the parties. It will be the reference point for the election,” Senator Brown said in Melbourne today.

 The Greens will:

 â Put an extra $9.1B into the environment, funded via a carbon pollution tax, the abolition of the diesel fuel rebate for miners and woodchippers and a redirection of the Natural Heritage Trust fund â equip every house in the country with solar hot water and a ‘green’ energy efficient fridge by 2010, saving average households $170 pa on bills and reducing the national greenhouse gas emissions by 3% â end Australia’s involvement in the nuclear industry, closing forever the Jabiluka and Honeymoon mines

 â rescue and conserve all remaining old growth and high conservation value forests and woodlands, including the Styx “Valley of the Giants” in Tasmania, the world’s tallest hardwood forest facing the death warrant under Mr Howard or Mr Beazley â a ‘New Deal’ for the land with an extra $3.7B, as recommend by the Australian Conservation Foundation and the National Farmers Federation, invested to address the crisis in land, water salinity, biodiversity and exotic pests

 â levy a carbon polluters tax, as recommended by the OECD, at $25 per tonne of CO2 to raise $6.8B per year â implement national legislation to arrest land clearing â create a World Environment Organisation to rival the power of the World Trade Organisation

 â provide refugee status for people fleeing environmental degradation (as does NZ) â hold a referendum to amend the constitution to give the Commonwealth direct national responsibility for the environment â halt Basslink which threatens Tasmania’s wild rivers, forests and economy and Gippsland’s countryside
