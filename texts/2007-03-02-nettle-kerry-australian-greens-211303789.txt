 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 

 Transferring Sri Lankans to Nauru could cost $60 million 

 2nd Mar 07 

 Transferring and detaining the 83 Sri Lankan asylum seekers on  Nauru will cast at least $60 million of taxpayer dollars and is  completely unnecessary, said Australian Greens Spokesperson on  Immigration, Senator Kerry Nettle.   

 “If the government intends to send the Sri Lankan asylum seekers  to Nauru, it should confess to the public how expensive the exercise  will be,” said Senator Nettle.   

 Departmental figures show the cost of keeping asylum seekers on  Nauru was $30 million per year in 2003-04 when the Nauru camp  last had a significant number of detainees. The average length of  stay on Nauru has been over two years. If the Sri Lankans are there  for two years it will have cost taxpayers at least $60 million.   

 “It was revealed at that the recent Senate Estimates that the  aeroplane used to transfer just eight Burmese asylum seekers from  Christmas Island to Nauru cost $225,000.   

 “It is a long way from Christmas Island to Nauru and 83 people plus  new staff and resources will need multiple jet flights.  The cost may  approach a million dollars.   

 "Christmas Island detention centre is also irresponsibly expensive at  $1830 per detainee per day. That means keeping the Sri Lankans  on Christmas Island is costing over $1 million a week.    

 “It is strange that the government will squander huge sums on the  failed Nauru policy when thousands of other asylum seekers are  living in the community while their cases are assessed.
