 Pinochet victims may lose Social Security income Victims of the Chilean dictator Pinochet, are in fear of losing their social security income because of a small compensation ‘pension of mercy’ from the Chilean Government, according to the Australian Democrats.

 “There should be no taxation on suffering. Money paid to help victims recover from horrific persecution and the loss of relatives should not deny them normal social security entitlements and it should not be taxed,” said Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Democrats’ welfare spokesperson.

 “It would cost the Australian Government very little to exclude compensation from Chile, from the Social Security income test. It only involves around 150 people who now live in Australia and receive social security payments. Most of them have family members who are missing, presumed dead, and they receive compensation of about $A270 per month from the Chilean Government.

 “The Social Security Act already contains an exemption for compensation payments from Germany and Austria for victims of National Socialist persecution,” Senator Bartlett said.

 The ‘pension of mercy without contribution’ is paid by the government of the Republic of Chile to compensate citizens who suffered the traumatic experience of exile, of disappearance and who had unjustly lost their jobs for political reasons during Pinochet’s brutal military regime from 1973 to 1990.

 One million Chilean citizens were forced to flee a brutal regime and sought political sanctuary all over the world. Unless the law is changed, Australia would be the only country to include the compensation in assessing taxable income and eligibility for other benefits, according to the ‘Chilean Committee of Refugees and Relatives of Missing People’.

 All aged pensioners who receive foreign pensions are required to declare their pensions by the 19 January 2001 under an amnesty.

 The Sydney-based Chilean group has written to Minister Newman without success.

 Senator Bartlett said the Democrats will propose an amendment to exempt the compensation payment from the Social Security income test, when Parliament resumes in early February.
