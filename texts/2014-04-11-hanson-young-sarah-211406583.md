 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young    

 Friday, 11 April 2014    

 As Nauru deal unravels, Morrison turns to Cambodia    

 The Immigration Minister’s confirmation that Cambodia is being considered as a resettlement option is  further proof that the Nauru and Manus Island deals are unravelling, the Australian Greens have said.    

 “Scott Morrison is shipping human suffering around our region,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson,  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “The Abbott Government’s so called ‘regional solution’ is just a poorly cobbled together network of  cruelty.    

 “Dumping refugees in poverty stricken Cambodia is no way for Australia to respond when people ask us  for help.    

 “There is a way to stop the boats while caring for people who need protection, but the Coalition is more  interested in playing to the bigots.    

 “Boosting refugee processing in the region and resettling larger numbers of people in Australia will ease  the burden and give people a safer option than boarding a boat.    

 “The current offshore detention regime is untenable and expanding it to include Cambodia, one of the  poorest nations in the region, will only makes it worse.”
