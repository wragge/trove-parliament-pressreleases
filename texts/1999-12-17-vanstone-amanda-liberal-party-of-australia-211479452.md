  CUSTOMS 
RESPONDS TO SECOND BOAT IN ONE DAY

  Customs and Immigration officers 
were today processing a group of 54 suspecte  d illegal immigrants at remote Vansittart Bay on 
the storm-battered north west coast of Western Australia, the Minister 
for Justice and Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone said today.

  The vessel was reported to Customs Coastwatch last 
night by workers at a pearl farm in the area. The Australian Customs 
Vessel   Botany Bay , which was 
on its way to Ashmore Reef to assist in the processing of 150 people 
detained earlier yesterday, was diverted to the area and a response 
team of Customs and Immigration officers from Darwin arrived by helicopter 
early this morning.

  Senator Vanstone said that it appeared that the vessel 
may have been heading for the Ashmore Reef area but was knocked off 
its course by the wild weather whipped up by two cyclones in the area.

  "The weather was so severe yesterday that Coastwatch 
had to cancel two flights over the area as flying conditions were unsafe," 
Senator Vanstone said.

  "This latest load of boat people appear to have 
had a rather rough ride to Australia."

  Senator Vanstone said that this latest vessel was 
the second one located yesterday. Earlier in the day an Indonesian inter-island 
ferry with 150 people on board was detained at Ashmore Islands.

  "It appears that this vessel was also knocked 
about by the rough weather as it had aborted an attempt to enter Australian 
waters earlier in the week."

  Senator Vanstone praised the staff of the Paspaley 
Pearl farm who had acted quickly to alert Coastwatch when the vessel 
was first sighted and had then assisted with the securing of the vessel 
and the people on board overnight.

  "I would also like to congratulate the men and 
women of Customs and Immigration who are working flat out to respond 
to the illegal arrivals in Australia at a time of year when many of 
us are turning our minds to holidays and relaxation," Senator Vanstone 
said.

  "The crews of Coastwatch aircraft and Customs 
and Navy patrol boats are also working in very difficult conditions 
and deserve our thanks for the excellent job they are doing," she 
said.

  Senator Vanstone said that the two groups of suspected 
illegal entrants detained yesterday brought the number of illegal vessel 
arrivals this month to five and the number of suspected illegal entrants 
to 319.

  This followed the arrival of 14 boats and 1240 people 
last month.
