 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It’s great to be here at the Prahran Mission. It’s good to be with Kelly O’Dwyer, my friend and the local  member. It’s really impressive to see what’s happening here, to see the way the Mission is working with  vulnerable people and helping them to become contributing members of our society.    

 Now, I think it’s very, very important that a decent and humane society works with everyone to try to  include everyone, to try to ensure that everyone can reach his or her full potential and it’s a long, hard road  for many people but we can never give up and it’s great that the Mission is doing this work and it’s very  impressive to see some of the outcomes that have been achieved. When I was the Employment Minister I  spent a lot of time working with the great charities of Australia to try to ensure that their dedication, their  skill, their insights, their discernment was applied to this vital task of bringing our society together and  helping people to realise their potential and it’s great to have this additional insight today, courtesy of Kelly  O’Dwyer.    

 Before I ask Kelly to say a bit more about the Mission, just a couple of other issues I wouldn’t mind  commenting on. Yesterday evening my senior colleagues and I received a briefing from officials of the  Department of Immigration and the Solicitor-General. It was a highly professional briefing, as you’d expect  from such senior officials of the Australian public service. My difficulty with the Government’s proposed  legislation is that it does strip out the protections that the Howard Government thought were necessary. It  does far more than simply restore the previous situation and my further difficulty is with giving a blank  cheque to a bad government. This is not a Minister who has proven himself to be competent in his previous  dealings with other countries, whether it be the so-called East Timor solution, the negotiations with PNG  over Manus Island or indeed the negotiations with Malaysia over the people swap and this idea of giving this  Minister an entirely unfettered discretion I think is one which is troubling.   

 Now, we’ll go through our normal party processes next week. We will go through those party processes and  I don’t want to pre-empt them but, as I say, I am troubled by this legislation and I’m surprised that local  Labor members of parliament aren’t equally troubled. I think that Anna Burke, the Member for Chisholm,  Michael Danby the Member for Melbourne Ports, they’re decent, compassionate people and I think they will  find this legislation pretty difficult. Certainly, as I said yesterday, the Howard Government and the Coalition 

 not only has the patent on offshore processing, it’s pretty obvious having seen this legislation that we also  have the patent on offshore protection.    

 The final point I want to make is - just arising from the shenanigans inside the Health Services Union and  inside the Labor Party more generally yesterday - there is plainly a culture of corrupt cronyism inside that  union. I fear it taints much wider sections of the Labor Party. Rather than offer up cosmetic changes the  challenge for the Prime Minister is to deal with this systemic culture of corrupt cronyism inside the union  movement and inside the Labor Party more generally and I think it’s tragic that senior Labor figures  yesterday were happy to rid themselves of 70,000 low paid workers while at the same time clinging for  political life to the Member for Dobell. It’s the culture of corruption that needs to go, not those low paid  workers who once upon a time would have been the heartland of the Labor Party.   

 Kelly?   

 KELLY O’DWYER:   

 Well I want to thank Tony Abbott and Margie Abbott for coming to Prahran today to sit down and have  breakfast with a number of people who have been working with the Prahran Mission.  Prahran Mission have  got this fantastic social enterprise, the Mission CafÃ©. They’ve been training people who have been long-term  unemployed, people who have suffered from mental illness and they have got them back into work. There’s  a well known proverb: give a man a fish, you feed him for a day but if you teach a man to fish you feed him  for a lifetime and that’s what Prahran Mission is doing. It’s giving people skills and confidence to get back  into the workplace and it’s also giving them an opportunity to be employed. We know that 80 per cent of  Australians who suffer from mental illness find it very difficult to retain employment and Prahran Mission is  going about doing their job to get those people back into work. So it’s a real delight to have Tony Abbott  come down here to listen to some of the personal stories that people have shared over breakfast, along with  his wife Margie and I’d like to really thank you for that, Tony.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Thanks so much Kelly. Thank you. Ok, do we have any questions?   

 QUESTION:   

 On the issue of migration legislation, you said that you’re troubled. Is there something specific that you’re,  you know, that perhaps is worrying or is it the entire sort of legislation?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, the Migration Act as established by the Howard Government provided for human rights protections  for people who were sent to third countries overseas. It’s absolutely spelt out in black and white in section  198 of the Migration Act that people who are sent overseas have to be accorded certain basic human rights  protections. Now, that section is entirely stripped out. Those human rights protections are entirely stripped  out.    

 Now, I’m not a bleeding heart, I appreciate that governments sometimes have to do very tough things but it  is troubling that the protections that the Howard Government thought were necessary for boat people being  sent overseas have been absolutely stripped out by the current Government and if it troubles me, surely it  should trouble even more people like Anna Burke and Michael Danby and the other people who were so  critical of the Howard Government’s Pacific Solution. I mean, the Prime Minister herself was very critical of  the Howard Government’s Pacific Solution. She said it was “costly, unsustainable and wrong in principle.”  She repeatedly said before the last election that there was no way, no way in the world that people were  going to be sent to countries which hadn’t signed the U.N refugee convention. There is not a single  inhibition on the Minister’s absolutely unfettered discretion to send people anywhere.   

 Now, as I said, we’ve got a policy process that we have to go through. We’ve got a decision-making process  that we have to go through and we’ll go through that process but if we say no to this legislation it will be  because we are saying yes to basic standards of human decency in the way people are treated.    

 QUESTION:   

 You’re meeting with Prime Minister Gillard on Monday. What will you be discussing?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well all along I’ve said that the way to stop the boats is Nauru, temporary protection visas and the option of  turning boats around where that can be done safely. Now, I think that is the way forward. Now, since June of  last year the Prime Minister has wanted to establish some kind of offshore processing and I support offshore  processing. I don’t support offshore dumping and I’ll be pointing out to the Prime Minister that all along she  could have had offshore processing at Nauru. Nauru has been ready, willing and able to resume offshore  processing at all times. Nauru is a very good friend of Australia. Nauru has a legal system which is very  similar to Australia and when the Nauruan detention centre was in operation before it was staffed and run by  Australians in accordance with Australian standards which is why - and this is very important - which is  why we were explicitly told by the Solicitor-General yesterday that there is nothing in the High Court  decision that would rule out offshore processing in Nauru.   

 QUESTION:   

 If you’ve already made your mind up in regards to offshore processing, what’s the point of meeting with the  Prime Minister?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 The Prime Minister has invited me to meet with her. I don’t want to be discourteous to the Prime Minister. I  want to be as constructive as I can in the difficult situation that Australia finds itself in, in regard to border  protection, but the duty of the Opposition is not to support bad policy. Our responsibility is to support good  policy and good policy would be offshore processing in Nauru. It wouldn’t be offshore processing under  circumstances where boat people have no serious, enforceable protections and the Howard Government  wrote the legislation with human rights protections in there for a reason, because we believe and we believed  in appropriate human rights protection. As I said, I am not a bleeding heart but there are certain basic  standards of decency which countries have to uphold and I believe that those standards of decency were in  the legislation that the Howard Government brought in and this Government is asking for a blank cheque to  send people anywhere, anytime, under any circumstances without any specific regards for their rights once  they are out of our country’s hands.   

 QUESTION:   

 If you don’t support these changes won’t the Government be legitimate if they criticise you, if they blame  you for every boat arrival that happens after that?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well I’m sure that the Government will blame us for whatever happens under any circumstances because  that’s all the Prime Minister does, talks incessantly about the Opposition and claims that we are responsible  for just about every problem under the sun but the fact is we need strong border protection. We had strong  border protection under the Howard Government. We can have strong border protection again if we restore  the policies that have been proven to work. Malaysia is a proven failure. Nauru is a proven success. When  Nauru was in operation we had fewer than three boats a year. Since Nauru has been closed down we’ve had  almost two boats a week. So since Malaysia was announced we’ve had 1,000 illegal arrivals. Since Malaysia  was signed we’ve had 400 illegal arrivals. So on the record Malaysia is not a deterrent but the problem with 

 the legislation that the Government wants us to support next week is that it strips out the human rights  protections which the Howard Government thought were necessary and as I said, I am troubled by this and I  would be very surprised if decent Labor members of parliament like Anna Burke and Michael Danby  weren’t equally troubled.   

 QUESTION:   

 You said you’re troubled by it but do you completely rule out supporting it?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well as I said, we’ve got a party process that we need to go through and I don’t want to pre-empt the party  process but if we say no to this legislation it will be because we are saying yes to basic standards of human  rights.   

 QUESTION:   

 Nicola Roxon is introducing some graphic images for cigarette plain packaging today. On plain packaging,  you know, do you think this is the answer to stop people smoking?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 When I was the Health Minister we ran hard with various programmes to reduce smoking and I’m quoting  from memory but I think under the Howard Government smoking rates dropped from over 20 per cent to  about 17 per cent. One of the things that was introduced by me and Christopher Pyne when we were in the  health portfolio were the graphic health warnings on cigarette packages. So I think that the Coalition has a  good record when it comes to campaigns against smoking, effective and practical campaigns against  smoking. We’ve always had some reservations about this particular measure but in the end we’ve supported  it because look, smoking is a real social problem and anything that can reasonably be done to reduce  smoking rates is something that I don’t want to stand in the way of.   

 QUESTION:   

 You touched on the HSU disassociating itself with Labor. Could things get any worse for Labor at this  stage?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, there are a series of problems which this Government and this Prime Minister has pledged to fix and  which they have manifestly failed to fix. It was a government that had “lost its way” a little over 12 months  ago, when the Prime Minister politically assassinated Kevin Rudd, and unfortunately the confusion has just  got worse. The chaos has just got worse since then.    

 Now, the HSU situation, the Health Services Union situation is emblematic of a culture of corrupt cronyism  which plainly exists in this union and I suspect elements of it exist much more widely. We’ve got the chief  of the HSU, the president of the HSU who’s on the national executive of the Australian Labor Party, he’s the  vice president of the New South Wales Labor Party. This union is at the heart of the Labor Party and the  tragedy is that senior Labor figures today are happy to be rid of the 70,000 low paid members that this union  represents while clinging on to the Member for Dobell and apparently, if Kathy Jackson is believed,  organising a cabal of cronies cover-up to try to stop the New South Wales police investigation into what’s  been going on and for the Prime Minister to be blithely indifferent to this, for the Prime Minister to talk  about improving the Labor Party without tackling this I just think is incomprehensible.
