 Refugees and Mandatory Detention:  What Australians Don't Know

 Sydney Institute Museum of Sydney Theatrette 16 October 2002

 Fr Frank Brennan SJ AO

 1. Border Protection , the Protection of Those Refugees Still in Direct Flight, and the Deterrence of those Refugees Engaged in Secondary Movement

 In democracies governed in accordance with the rule of law, persons during peace time are deprived of their liberty by means of State-authorised detention ordinarily only  by  order  of  a  court  and  such  detention  is  usually  subject  to  ongoing  judicial supervision.   One  exception  is  migration  detention:  whether  it  be  preventing unauthorised  entry  into  the  territory,  detaining  the  person  for  the  purpose  of establishing  identity  or  of  determining  that  the  person  is  not  a  health  or  security risk,  or  holding  the  person  for  removal  from  the  territory.   In  these  circumstances, governments can authorise detention without the need for court action.

 Countries which have signed the Refugee Convention are entitled to maintain the  integrity  of  their  borders  but  Article  21  stipulates  that  they  "shall  not  impose penalties,  on  account  of  their  illegal  entry  or  presence,  on  refugees  who,  coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1, enter or are present in their territory without authorisation, provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence."

 Even  though  most  of  the  asylum  seekers  who  arrived  by  boat  in  Australian territory   these  last  few  years  have  proved  to  be  refugees,  the  government  argues that  they  have  not  come  directly  from  a  territory  where  their  life  or  freedom  was threatened.   In  the  government's  opinion,  most  (if  not  all)  the  refugees  have  had protection  available  to  them  in  some  other  place  en  route.   They  continued  their journey  not  for  protection  but  for  a  migration  outcome,  seeking  a  better  life  in Australia.   The  government  therefore  claims  that  it  is  entitled  to  impose  penalties such  as  detention  and  the  provision  of  a  visa  with  restrictive  and  discriminatory provisions given that everyone is presumed to have spent at least seven days in a country where protection was available.  Last week the government issued a series

 Sydney Institute 2

 of papers prepared as a contribution to the UNHCR's Expert Roundtable Series.  In

 the paper on Article 31, DIMIA states:1

 There is no Australian jurisprudence specifically on the phrase ‘coming directly from’ in Article 31(1).

  In the view of the Australian Government, a person  to  whom  Australia  owes  protection  will fall  outside  the  scope  of  Article  31(1)  if  he  or  she  spent  more  than  a  short  period  of  time  in  a third  country  whilst  travelling  between  the  country  of  persecution  and  Australia,  and  settled  there in safety or was otherwise accorded protection, or there was no good reason why they could not have sought  and  obtained  effective  protection  there.  What  amounts  to  a  short  period  of  time  will depend ultimately on the facts of a particular case. 

 But this has not deterred the government from arbitrarily setting seven days

 residence in a country as the cut-off for access to a permanent protection visa, even if protection  could  have  been  sought  only  through  the  offices  of  UNHCR  in  that country.   Does  this  mean  that  any  refugee  who  has  spent  a  week  en  route  in Indonesia waiting for a boat to Australia can be penalised and denied a permanent protection visa because they could have gone to Jakarta and joined the queue at the UNHCR office rather than awaiting a boat in precarious circumstances?  Given that Indonesia  is  not  a  signatory  to  the  Convention  and  given  that  the  country  is  not governed by the rule of law, how can it credibly be argued that boat people should stop  their  journey  in  Indonesia  and  enjoy  sufficient  protection?   Mr  Robert Illingworth, Assistant Secretary of DIMIA for Onshore Protection has told the Senate committee:2

 With the agreement of the Indonesian authorities, the UNHCR operates in Indonesia to identify people

 in need of protection. As a general principle, the UNHCR is not involved in directly providing physical protection  to  refugees. …The  UNHCR  can  mandate  an  individual,  but  in  most  cases  the UNHCR…given that there are 12 million refugees in the world, is not in a position to provide physical protection in the face of somebody intent on persecuting them or refouling them. It relies heavily on the cooperation of states. 

 What about the Afghan Hazaras  who  were  kept  away  from  the  UNHCR  queue  by

 the Pashtun  Pakistanis?   How  does  one  prove  or  disprove  access  to  appropriate protection through the offices of UNHCR?

 Australia's  unilateral  attempts  to  design  punitive  deterrents  to  secondary movement  have  not  been  welcomed  by  UNHCR.    UNHCR's chief Ruud  Lubbers has told the European Union Justice and Home Affairs Council:3

 A  major  concern  today  is  the  issue  of  secondary  movements  of  refugees  and  asylum  seekers.   I  am

 convinced  that  the  international  community  needs  new  agreements  to  deal  with  cross-cutting  issues such as this.  These new agreements would supplement the Convention and form part of multilateral frameworks for protecting refugees and achieving durable solutions, primarily in regions of origin.

 Sydney Institute 3

 I  hope  it  is  not  too  late  for  the  Australian  government  to  heed  Mr  Lubbers,

 caution: "The current trend towards more unilateralism  is  adding  to  the  confusion, and needs to be reversed.  It can be."  Those who have suffered most as a result of Australia's unilateral action have overwhelmingly been found to be refugees and no security  threat  at  all. Over  the  last  three  years,  ASIO,  the  government's  security organisation, had checked 5,986 unauthorised arrivals to assess whether or not they constituted  a  direct  or  indirect  threat  to  Australia  and  found  that  not  one  of  those persons constituted such a threat.   It is in the interests of  the refugees of the world that we address the problems of secondary movement and 9-11 heeding the warning of  Mr  Lubbers  that  we  "build  an  effective  system  of  international  burden  sharing, where governments are discouraged from taking unilateral and punitive action, and where  refugees  are  able  to  rely  on  adequate  protection  and  assistance  within  their regions of origin.  For to take punitive action is to shoot oneself in the foot.  It is not effective, and it only worsens the climate between North and South."4

 The matter is more complex than Mr Paddy McGuinness would have it in his

 most recent Quadrant  editorial  where  he  says,  "There  is  in  fact  no  argument  about the  right  of  refugees,  as  defined  in  the  1951  Convention,  to  arrive  without authorisation and claim asylum in the first country at which they arrive.  Few such people actually arrive in Australia and claim asylum."5   He  then  proposes  that  all other refugees are false refugees for the purposes of the Convention, and therefore not  deserving  of  compassionate  entrance.   But  what  about  those  refugees  who  set out on their journey, not especially seeking an Australian lifestyle, but seeking real protection  for  themselves  and  their  family,  being  of  the  view  that  Australia  is  the first port of call on the only journey available to them where they think there is the prospect  of  real  protection?   Many  Afghan  and  Iraqi  asylum  seekers  have  told  me that they would have gone to Europe if they could afford it.  Australia happened to be the cheapest available destination offering the prospect of real protection. Many of them knew little or nothing about Australia other than the smuggler's assurance that  protection  was  guaranteed.    Mr McGuinness  thinks  that  all  refugees  are obligated to seek protection "in the first possible country".  In recent times, Afghans and Iraqis have gone to any safe country they can find.  It is not as if they have set their sights especially on Australia.   Like the Jews after World War II, they should be  accorded  some  latitude  in  finding  asylum  even  if  there  be  a  country  closer  to their home country where some other refugees from their country could have found protection.  It is wrong for government to design a punitive deterrent policy based on  the  simplistic McGuinness  presumption  that  few  if  any  refugees  reaching Australia could be seeking real protection at the first available port of call.  In times of  crisis,  Australia  like  all  countries  which  can  offer  real  protection  should  be expected  to  pull  its  weight  in  offering  proper  assessment  and  protection  to  those who come seeking asylum.  We should not go it alone in designing more punitive

 means for deterring asylum seekers thereby punishing true refugees as much as the

 handful of undoubted secondary moving economic migrants.

 2. The Legal and Constitutional Limits of Detention

 In Lim's case in 1992  the Australian High Court set the constitutional limits for government acting unilaterally to detain persons under the immigration power, without  recourse  to  the  courts.   Those  limits  are  less  restrictive  than  the  European Convention  on  Human  Rights  which  authorises  detention  in  migration  cases without  court  order  only  in  limited  circumstances.   Deprivation  of  liberty  is authorised for "the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised  entry  into  the  country  or  of  a  person  against  whom  action  is  being taken  with  a  view  to  deportation  or  extradition."6   Once  a  person  has  effected  an unlawful entry he cannot be detained for a substantial period except on court order or  while  awaiting  deportation.   Long  term  detention  without  judicial  order  or supervision  for  the  purpose  or  processing  asylum  claims  is  just  not  on  in  Europe. Here in Australia in Lim,  three  of  the  High  Court  judges  observed  that  migration detention laws would be valid:

 if the detention which they require and authorise is limited to what is reasonably capable of being seen as necessary for the purposes of deportation or necessary to enable an application for an entry permit to be made and considered.  On the other hand, if the detention which those sections require and authorise is not so limited, the authority which they purportedly confer upon the Executive cannot properly be seen as an incident of the executive powers to exclude, admit and deport an alien.  In that event, they will  be  of  a  punitive  nature  and  contravene  Chapter  III's  insistence  that  the  judicial  power  of  the Commonwealth be vested exclusively in the courts which it designates.  

 It is these observations of the High Court which explain the tenor of the Mr.

 Ruddock's oft repeated  remarks  that "Detention is not arbitrary.  It is humane and is not designed to be punitive."  These ministerial comments about deterrence and the  non-punitive  intent  of  the  detention  are  related  to  the  constitutional  doubts about  the  validity  of  legislation  authorising  administrative  detention  of  persons without access to the courts when their detention is neither relevant nor incidental to the  processing  of  their  applications  for  an  entry  permit  and  when  the  detention  is neither  relevant  nor  incidental  to  their  removal  or  deportation  in  the  foreseeable future.

 Both  sides  of  Australian  politics  in  the  national  parliament  have  supported law  and  policy  which  authorises  detention  of  asylum  seekers  not  just  for  the determination  of  health,  security  and  identity  issues  at  the  commencement  of  the asylum  process  and  at  the  end  of  an  unsuccessful  claim,  awaiting  deportation  but detention from the moment of unauthorised entry until departure or issue of a visa. Despite  the  protestations  of  the  minister,  mandatory  detention  in  places  such  as Woomera  is  an  integral  part  of  the  government's  deterrent  regime  designed  to

 

 6 ECHR Article 5 (1)(f)

 Sydney Institute 5

 punish those who come to our shores or who enter our territorial waters without our

 permission.

 The  government  has  expressed  strong  criticism  of  Justice  Bhagwati's  UN report of "Human Rights and Immigration Detention in Australia" which concludes that7

 From a human rights point of view, the detention of children in the context of immigration procedures is

 certainly contrary to international standards

 Mr Ruddock has published his  "Detailed Rebuttals" to the Report of the UN

 Human  Rights  Commissioner's  Envoy  into  Human  Rights  and  Immigration Detention.  I agree with him that "The length of the period of detention should not be  considered  in  the  abstract  but  must  be  considered  alongside  the  reasons  for detention (that is to ensure that unlawful non-citizens are available for processing, to allow identity, security and health checks to be made and to ensure availability for removal if they are not owed protection)."8

 It was no part of Bhagwati's brief to determine whether the Australian regime

 amounted  to  arbitrary  detention.   That  was  decided  back  in  1997  when  the  UN Human  Rights  Committee  (of  which  he  was  a  member)  ruled  on  a  complaint  by  a Cambodian  detainee  ("Mr  A")  under  the  first  optional  protocol  of  the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  In those days there was still a 273 day limit on detention and in that case there was no problem about the applicant being able to return  to  his  home  country  should  he  have  so  wished.   The  decision  was disregarded by Australian politicians on the basis that it was simply the opinion of an international committee.

 Last  year,  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  the  United  Kingdom  quoted  the  UN's decision on the mandatory nature of the Australian detention regime and went on to state  its  unanimously  held  belief  "that  most  right  thinking  people  would  find  it objectionable  that  such  persons  should  be  detained  for  a  period  of  any  significant length  of  time  while  their  applications  are  considered,  unless  there  is  risk  of  their absconding or committing other misbehaviour."9

 The Australian government is right to reject alternatives which would permit

 detention of unaccompanied adults and mandate the release of family groups with children.   Such  a  policy  would  only  encourage  parents  to  put  children  to  sea  on these dangerous voyages.  Consistent with the High Court's decision in the Lim Case ten  years  ago,  detention  of  all  persons,  including  children,  should  be  restricted  to

 migration purposes and should take place in locations which are well suited to the

 purpose  of  detention,  especially  the  efficient  processing  of  visa  applications. Deterrence  in  the  desert  is  the  big  lie  in  the  government's  policy,  causing  the minister to trip up on the use of the word "deterrence".

 3. The Government Rationale for Mandatory Detention

 The government gives four reasons for mandatory detention of unlawful non-citizens seeking asylum:

 1. Saving lives - the government's leaflet distributed in Indonesia reads:

  If you get on a boat in Indonesia you will:

 * Expose yourself and your family to great danger * Lose your money

 * Fail in your objective to get to Australia

 The boats used by people smugglers are overcrowded and dangerous. Too many people have died trying to enter Australia by boat.

 Stop. Go back. Don't get further into the trap.'

 2. Saving  spaces  -  the  Government  has  decided  to  tie  the  number  of  off-shore

 humanitarian places to the number of on-shore asylum claims each year.  There is no particular moral logic to this linkage.  For example it would be unthinkable in  the  United  States  that  they  would  link  the  onshore  claims  of  asylees  to  the 70,000 places for resettlement of off-shore refugees each year.  In the US, there are 50-60,000  on-shore  asylum  applications  instituted  voluntarily  each  year  by applicants  who  come  forward  and  make  an  affirmative  application.    60%  of those are granted even before the applicant appeals to the Board of Immigration Appeals.  They are not held in detention.  The only ones held in detention at this stage are those who are held for expedited removal on arrival at ports of entry, it being  decided  that  they  do  not  have  credible  fear  and  their  claim  is  manifestly unfounded.   In  the  US,  it  is  accepted  that  the  nation  state  has  two  discrete functions  to  perform:  process  the  legitimate  on  shore  asylum  claims  and  offer resettlement to a pre-set quota of off-shore refugees.  That is the way we used to do it before the Howard government created this new moral calculus for "saving spaces".   It  is  time  to  once  again  break  the  nexus.   Incidentally  there  is  a  major crisis of immigration detention in the US at the moment.  But it does not relate to unprocessed  asylum  seekers  but  rather  to  long  term  residents  who  never  took out  citizenship  and  who  now  are  being  detained  and  deported  in  their thousands  following  convictions  for  criminal  offences  pursuant  to  the  broad provisions passed by Congress in 1996.  60% of those in immigration detention are  held  in  county  jails  because  there  are  not  sufficient  INS  facilities  to accommodate the overflow of detainees.

 3. Giving  preference  to  off  shore  refugees  and  humanitarian  cases  in  greatest

 need  over  on  shore  asylum  seekers  who  are  seeking  a  migration  outcome  in Australia, having had the opportunity to find asylum elsewhere.   But  many  of the  4,000  off  shore  refugees  we  take  each  year  are  chosen  from  the  pile  (rather than the queue) on the basis that they have good qualifications and are judged to be good migrant prospects for Australia.  And those who come under the Special Humanitarian  program  must  have  some  link  with  Australia,  being  formally proposed  by  an  Australian  citizen  or  some  organisation  which  is  active  in Australia.

 4. Eliminating the problem of overstayers - On  average,  we  have  received  about 1,000 boat people a year for the last 14 years.  Prior to Tampa, there was a new peak of 4,000 a year.  Most of them were found to be refugees.  If applicants had been released in to the community after health, security and identity issues had been  resolved  there  may  have  been  a  small  group  of  overstayers.   But  we  do have  60,000  other  overstayers  a  year.   Detention  of  all  boat  people,  especially when  most  of  them  have  been  proved  to  be  refugees  is  excessive  and discriminatory given the small percentage they would have added to the group of overstayers.

 4. Mandatory Detention: One Ingredient of the Australian Recipe for Border Control

 Mandatory detention is one element for the achievement of these goals.  The other elements include:

 â¢ Asking (and providing payment in kind for) Indonesian authorities to engage in disruption  activities,  not  ruling  out  activities  which  we  would  not  expect  our own  AFP  to  perform  and  which  we  would  not  expect  to  be  scrutinised  by  the Australian or Indonesian parliaments.

 â¢ Asking  the  Australian  Navy  to  deter  unauthorised  boats  from  entering  our territorial waters.  This has included our navy personnel firing shots 50-100 feet in  front  of  overcrowded  wooden  boats  in  the  middle  of  the  night.   The  navy's task  became  more  manageable  following  the  loss  of  all  lives  on  SIEV  X  which went  down  in  international  waters  within  the  surveillance  area  of  Operation Relex.

 â¢ Granting  only  a  three  year  temporary  protection  visa  to  the  refugees  who establish  their  claim,  denying  them  the  right  of  family  reunion  or  the  right  to travel overseas and return.

 â¢ Granting  only  a  renewed  three  year  protection  visa  subject  to  the  same limitations rather than a permanent visa to those who establish that they are still

 Sydney Institute 8

 refugees  in  need  of  protection  three  years  later  if  they  had  ever  resided  for  a

 continuous  period  of  at  least  7  days  in  a  country  in  which  the  applicant  could have  sought  and  obtained  effective  protection  of  the  country  or  through  the offices of UNHCR located in that country.10 â¢ Implementing  the  Pacific  Solution  with  the  excision  of  Christmas  Island  and

 Ashmore  Reef  from  the  migration  zone  and  the  detention  of  asylum  seekers  in Nauru  and  Manus  Island  (contrary  to  their  Constitutions)  and  in  the  case  of Nauru,  without  access  to  lawyers  (who  were  constantly  denied  visas)  and without ICRC's tracing services being available. â¢ Immunising  government  decisions  from  court  review  with  the  attempted

 enactment of a comprehensive privative clause.

 Despite  claims  to  the  contrary  by  the  government,  this  uniquely  Australian solution has no appeal in Europe.  In the UK, they are perturbed by the number of asylum  applicants  coming  unlawfully  through  the  chunnel.   But  it  is  just  not possible to expect the French police to engage in what our own Minister for Justice felicitously describes as "upstream disruption" activities without detection by either Parliament.   There  is  no  possibility  of  firing  shots  at  people  trying  to  deter  their entry.  The British express a delightful surprise that Australians of all people would be engaged in a Pacific solution, shipping their unwanted human flotsam to remote islands.   That  colonial  practice  was  abandoned  a  couple  of  centuries  ago.   With 51,500 onshore asylum applications being made in the UK in the first six months of this year (as compared with 3,284 in Australia), it is just not practicable to lock up those  who  are  not  lawful  entrants.   And  countries  like  the  US  and  the  EU  do  not have the same obsession as we do with granting an electronic travel authority11  or visa to all comers to their territory.  In a globalised world, they have better things to do with their time and resources.  The Germans, sharing land boundaries with nine countries  would  see  little  point  in  attempting  a  comprehensive  registration  of border  crossings.    The  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  precludes mandatory  detention  for  asylum  seekers.   The  French  and  German  constitutions even guarantee the right of asylum.

 With  a  comprehensive  visa  regime,  we  Australians  have  taken  to  classing asylum  seekers  as  unlawful  non-citizens  but  this  domestic  classification  overlooks the  international  law  and  reality  nicely  highlighted  by  Justice  Merkel  in  the  recent case of the Palestinian Al Masri who was ordered released from detention because, in accordance with Lim's  case,  the  government  had  no  real  likelihood  of  deporting Al  Masri  back  to  the  Gaza  Strip  once  he  had  exhausted  all  claims  to  asylum  and once he had asked to be returned home.  Justice Merkel said:12

 The  Refugees  Convention  is  a  part  of  conventional  international  law  that  has  been  given  legislative

 effect in Australia.  It has always been fundamental to the operation of the Refugees Convention that

 

 10 Reg 866.215 Migration regulations 1994 11  Such  an  authority  is  available  to  the  passport  holders  of  30  listed  countries,  provided  they  are  staying  in Australia for less than three months for tourism, family visit or business. 12 [2002] FCA 1009 (15 August 2002), #61

 Sydney Institute 9

 many applicants for refugee status will, of necessity, have left their countries of nationality unlawfully and therefore, of necessity, will have entered the country in which they seek asylum unlawfully. Jews seeking refuge from war-torn Europe, Tutsis seeking refuge from Rwanda, Kurds seeking refuge from Iraq,  Hazaras  seeking  refuge  from  the  Taliban  in  Afghanistan  and  many  others,  may  also  be  called "unlawful  non-citizens"  in  the  countries  in  which  they  seek  asylum.  Such  a  description,  however, conceals, rather than reveals, their lawful  entitlement  under  conventional  international  law  since  the early 1950's (which has been enacted into Australian law) to claim refugee status as persons who are "unlawfully" in the country in which the asylum application is made.

 On a Friday evening more than a week before the Commonwealth was in a position

 to return Al Masri to the Gaza Strip, police were instructed to detain him once again, necessitating  the  Federal  Court  to  sit  again  on  a  Saturday  morning  to  order  once again  his  ongoing  liberty  under  habeas  corpus.    This  government  action  under cover  of  night  which  was  a  flagrant  discourtesy  (if  not  contempt)  of  the  court highlights the present Executive obsession in Australia with keeping unlawful non-entrants  under  lock  and  key,  away  from  the  watchful  gaze  of  the  judiciary. Incidentally the Al  Masri  decision  should  be  good  news  for  all  Palestinians  and Iraqis in detention who have exhausted all applications for asylum and asked to be returned home rather than being held in detention.

 5. The European Experience

 (a) UK

 In  the  UK,  there  have  been  increased  efforts  to  remove  failed  asylum  seekers  who have no lawful right to remain.  The Home Secretary was hoping to remove up to 30,000  such  persons  a  year.   That  has  not  been  possible.   And  no  one  knows  the number  of  overstayers  there  are  in  the  UK.   There  are  about  480,000  new  settlers who  move  to  the  UK  each  year  and  up  to  300,000  permanent  departures.   The  UK government is committed to building removal centres with 4,000 detention places -but  these  would  not  be  places  for  persons  still  pursuing  asylum  claims.   They would be places for persons who have run the asylum gauntlet and who have not only failed to obtain asylum.  They have also failed to obtain "exceptional leave to remain" (ELR) which is extended to persons on humanitarian grounds even though they cannot establish that they are refugees.  In 2000, the UK authorities on average took 15 months to decide an on shore asylum claim.  70% of those were refused; 14% were  found  to  be  refugees  and  a  further  16%  (11,495)  were  given  ELR  status.   The Home Secretary has announced his intention to amend the process for ELR because it has blown out from 10 to 25% of the caseload in the last five years.  But countries such as Germany with their duldung status (tolerated status for one who would face cruel  and  degrading  treatment  back  home  contrary  to  the  ECHR  Article  3)  and  the UK  with  ELR  accept  the  need  to  grant  temporary  residence  on  humanitarian grounds  to  persons  who  though  not  strictly  refugees  are  nonetheless  not  in  a position  to  return  home  safely.   In  Australia  we  have  become  obsessed  with

 Sydney Institute 10

 determining whether someone without a visa is a refugee in the strict sense or not.

 If  they  are  not,  we  rarely  countenance  their  remaining  in  Australia  whatever  the horror they will face back home.  The handful who get to remain in Australia can do so only if they enjoy the non-enforceable, non-reviewable discretion of the Minister, this  discretion  being  the  only  means  for  ensuring  Australia's  compliance  with  the Convention  Against  Torture  and  the  International  Covenant  on  Civil  and  Political Rights  which  provides  that  no  one  shall  be  subjected  to  cruel,  inhuman  or degrading treatment or punishment.

 In  the  UK,  most  asylum  seekers  are  first  of  all  put  up  in  hostels  and  other reception  centres  at  the  port  or  in  London  for  the  first  eight  weeks  where  they  are free  to  come  and  go.  The  centres  provide  meals  and  the  asylum  seekers  are  given vouchers.    They  are  then  dispersed  throughout  the  country  if  they  are  unable  to provide  for  their  own  accommodation.  NASS  (National  Asylum  Support  Service) officials  make  arrangements  for  their  accommodation  with  local  authorities, voluntary organisations and accommodation providers.  At  the  moment,  access  to the labour market is permitted after six months, but the government is threatening to  take  away  that  right  in  its  largely  symbolic  attempts  to  get  tough  on  asylum seekers.   The  Home  Secretary,  Mr.  David  Blunkett  has  recently  told  the  Home Affairs Select Committee:13

 (The right to work after six months) was an incentive for people not to want an early decision. Secondly,

 it  sent  all  the  wrong  signals  apropos  what  happens  in  other  European  countries.  I  do  not  think  we should under-estimate the critical importance of signals that are sent. With countries now evaluating their  own  policies,  we  can  see  and  we  can  track  the  change  in  direction  of  particular  nationalities dependent  on  what  they  think  is  available  to  them.  We  want  to  say  to  people,  "If  you  want  to  claim asylum,  then  you  should  use  the  legitimate  asylum  route.  If  you  want  to  work  you  should  use  the economic  migration  work  permit  route."  That  is  why,  contrary  to  those  who  are  against  any  form  of inward migration - and there are people now promoting this quite heavily and we will see more of it in the media through the months ahead - I believe that we need a managed economic migration policy in order to welcome people in the country. It has to be robust and managed. At the moment a very large number of people seek asylum as a route to migration and we should discourage that.

 The UK government is now proposing to build a chain of processing centres

 around the country, but there is no suggestion of universal,  mandatory detention. The Home Secretary hopes to construct four processing centres with 750 beds each in the next couple of years.  While we have constructed detention centres in some of the  remotest  and  least  hospitable  parts  of  Australia  (Woomera,  Port  Hedland  and Baxter), the Home Secretary has told the Home Affairs Select Committee:

 I  do  not  see  why  it  should  be  the  most  disadvantaged  areas  of  the  country  -  when  there  is accommodation  available  by  the  very  nature  of  the  accommodation  being  empty  and  where  there  are school places because they are not oversubscribed and where GP practices have registration available -that  should  take  asylum  seekers.  I  do  not  see  any  reason  whatsoever  why  it  should  be  the  most disadvantaged  areas  of  the  country  that  have  to  take  that  additional  pressure,  which  is  why accommodation centres properly placed in a variety of areas would, in my view, provide both for the

 

 13 Evidence 18 September 2002

 Sydney Institute 11

 needs  of  asylum  seekers,  and  meet  the  requirements  of  a  robustly  managed  asylum  policy  and  good community and race relations, as it reduces the pressures which allow others to foster and fester racism.

  The  Executive  Officer  of  the  British  Refugee  Council  has  expressed  the

 Council's  concern  to  the  Home  Affairs  Select  Committee  about  the  government proposals which by Australian standards are already most enlightened:14

 These  accommodation  centres  will  have  750  people  each.  Let's  say  by  some  miracle  they  get  people

 through in six months, they are still then looking in total, even by 2005, at less than ten per cent of all asylum seekers going through this system. The idea that they will then somehow be able to construct the other 40 they need in a short space of time is unlikely. The point I want to make is that from our point of view the key issue for the support of asylum seekers is going to be that the dispersal system pretty much as it now is will continue for many years to come. One of the problems I have with the accommodation centres  is  the  huge  amounts  of  political  and  management  energy  which  is  going  into  setting  up something  which,  frankly,  is  not  going  to  have  that  much  impact  on  the  overall  support  of  asylum seekers. The key issue from our point of view is making the dispersal system work. Having said that, in principle our problem with the accommodation centres as proposed is that they are too big and in the wrong place. The Home Office has got itself in a muddle over this. When they started they said, "This is a trial. By definition, we are not sure if this is going to work. We are going to try this and see if it works." And  suddenly  this  trial  has  become  an  enormous  point  of  principle.  Even  if  you  look  at  the  way  the trials have progressed so far in the planning stages, the costs and time involved are much greater than originally anticipated. I think they should look at the whole system on that basis. The starting position is let's have these big centres and then decide what we are going do in them. I think they should have done  it  the  other  way  round  and  said,  "What  is  the  process  we  want  to  follow?"  How  do  we  best integrate and support the decision-making processes and what infrastructure do we need in order for that?" That is where we are coming to our proposal for much smaller "core and cluster" centres.

 Presently,  if  someone  is  judged  to  have  a  manifestly  unfounded  asylum

 claim  they  can  be  taken  immediately  in  to  detention  at  the  Oakington  detention centre  where  their  claim  is  promptly  processed  in  a  matter  of  days  with  the provision  of  legal  advice.    Others  who  are  ultimately  rejected  for  asylum  or  ELR may be rounded up in the community and placed in detention at removal centres or prisons, awaiting their deportation.  There are about 2,000 persons in such detention at any one time.

 Mr. Ruddock is right to say that the UK government is wanting to tighten up on  asylum  seekers.   He  is  wrong  to  claim  that  they  are  attracted  to  the  Australian model  which  would  be  unworkable  and  contrary  to  the  European  Convention  on Human Rights.  The UK Government is attracted to the idea of an annual quota of off  shore  refugees  being  offered  permanent  resettlement,  in  part  to  put  a compassionate face on stricter measures for asylum seekers at home.  But there is no interest in judicially unreviewable mandatory detention of any asylum seeker who enters the country without a visa or an electronic travel authority.

 (b) EU Harmonisation

 Over  the  next  couple  of  years,  the  EU  is  concluding  its  harmonisation  of policy  and  practices  relating  to  asylum  seekers.  The  proposed  Council  directive                                                 

 14 Evidence 17 September 2002

 Sydney Institute 12

 laying  down  minimum  standards  on  the  reception  of  applicants  for  asylum  in

 Member States provides:

 Member  states  shall  not  hold  applicants  for  asylum  in  detention  for  the  sole  reason  that  their applications for asylum need to be examined.

 The  European  Parliament's  Committee  on  Citizens'  Freedoms  and  Rights

 from Justice and Home Affairs has recommended that detention be permitted only to determine identity when documents have been lost or forged, to ensure removal of  one  whose  claim  has  been  rejected,  or  to  protect  national  security  and  public order.   The  harmonisation  exercise  will  not  be  complete  until  2004.   Meantime governments are proceeding with bilateral and trilateral negotiations trying to bed down  lowest  common  denominator  procedures  in  the  hope  that  such  agreements will consolidate their bargaining position at the EU table.  The UK Home Secretary recently told the Home Affairs Select Committee:

 There is a new spirit in terms of recognising that we must work together on this - I was discussing this with  the  Justice  and  Home  Affairs  Council  only  this  last  weekend  -  and  a  commitment  to  people building  on  what  is  called  Eurodac,  the  finger-printing  and  biometric  system  which  within  the Schengen area and in co-operation with us will help us to be able to do a much better job Europe-wide. I am not waiting for European-wide agreement on anything. Waiting for Dublin II is a bit like "waiting for Godot", so we have to make what progress we can as quickly as we can bilaterally and trilaterally based on what we are anticipating on a Europe-wide basis.

 Meanwhile  the  major  organisations  in  the  UK  advocating  the  refugee  cause  and

 providing  refugee  assistance  have  expressed  cautious  optimism  about  the harmonisation  process.   Keith  Best  of  the  Immigration  Advisory  Service  told  the Committee:

 What we are ending up with, though, is that very often the EC Draft Directives that are coming out in this field are ones that do have adequate safeguards and are ones that many of us could live with quite happily, but by the time individual ministers have got their hands on it, they are being cut down to such minimum  standards  that  they  are  not  harbouring  the  safeguards  that  we  would  want  to  see  in  a common European policy.

 Nick Hardwick from the Refugee Council told the committee:

 Clearly  it  is  a  good  thing  to  move  in  that  direction.  I  agree  with  Keith's  analysis.  I  think  some  of  the proposals coming out of the Commission are quite positive. If we simply go down to the lowest common denominator, it will be a missed opportunity. I would say about a harmonisation process that it is not a panacea. We do not think that is going to solve everything and make the whole system work better right across Europe and make it perfect, but I think it would help.

 (c) Germany

 Germany has the greatest restrictions on the movement of asylum seekers.  But they could never contemplate going down the path of mandatory detention.  They have received 130,000 applications a year on average these last four years despite the fact that  those  coming  overland  claiming  asylum  will  be  immediately  returned  to  the

 Sydney Institute 13

 safe third country from which they have come.  All asylum seekers must stay in one

 of the 32 initial reception centres around the country.  They are not detained but it is compulsory for them to reside in one of these centres during the first few months. They are then dispersed to one of the 16 Landers unless their case is judged to be manifestly unfounded in which case they are given a week to leave the country, and with very limited appeal rights.  Within each lander, there are subdistricts to which an  applicant  will  be  confined  -  spreading  the  load  throughout  the  country.   Some applicants are confined to areas no greater than 15 sq km.   Bear in mind that they had  438,000  asylum  claimants  in  1992  following  the  war  in  the  former  Yugoslavia. They are not allowed to work for a year and may leave their allocated district only with  permission  for  special  reasons.   They  have  to  stay  in  the  accommodation allocated while their application is finalised and that can take from 2 - 7 years.  They receive vouchers and limited welfare assistance.

 6. The Australian Detention Gulag

 The Australian detention regime is now split between the mainland and the Pacific solution venues.  On the mainland, there are three reception centres where unlawful non-citizens  are  detained:   Woomera  and  Baxter  in  South  Australia  and  Port Hedland in Western Australia.  They are all run by ACM under contract to DIMIA. The  contractual  arrangement,  the  appointment  of  senior  DIMIA  staff  to  outside consultancies  and  the  Pacific  solution  are  key  elements  in  removing  the  process from  judicial,  parliamentary  and  public  scrutiny.   Off-shore  processing  is  done  in the hope that it will be spared judicial review by the High Court regardless of the fate  of  the  privative  clause.   Consultants  and  ACM  staff  unlike  public  servants cannot readily be compelled to give evidence to parliamentary committees.  These reception  centres  previously  held  a  majority  of  detainees  who  were  awaiting  a decision  from  the  primary  decision  maker  or  the  Refugee  Review  Tribunal.   If  the applicants were Afghan or Iraqi they had a very good chance of success.

 The  government  justifies  detention  in  part  because  it  helps  with  the processing of claims.  Detention in an accessible place and in a more work friendly environment might help with processing.  The detention regime contributes to and helps to disguise the uneven performance of our decision makers especially when it comes  to  the  Iraqis  and  Afghans  who  have  been  applying  for  protection  this  last year.

 During the last financial year (1 July 2001 - 30 June 2002), the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) set aside 62% of all Afghan decisions appealed and 87% of all Iraqi decisions appealed.  This means that Afghan asylum seekers got it right 62% of the time when they claimed that the departmental decision makers got it wrong.  And the public servants got it wrong 87% of the times that the Iraqi applicants claim to have  been  mistakenly  assessed.   Meanwhile  the  RRT  set  aside  only  7.9%  of decisions appealed by members of other ethnic groups.  Even more disturbing than these comparisons is the statistic that in the last financial year, the RRT finalised 855

 Sydney Institute 14

 detention cases of which 377 were set aside.  This is a 44% set aside rate in detention

 cases.  82%  of  all  Afghan  and  Iraqi  applicants  were  found  to  be  refugees  by  the primary  decision  makers  (7,330  out  of  8,965  applicants)   over  the  last  three  years. Nonetheless it is concerning that the primary decision makers get it wrong so often when they reject any Afghan or Iraqi claim.

 Whereas  previously  our  mainland  detention  centres  were  primarily processing  centres  for  those  with  a  real  expectation  of  release  on  a  visa,  at  the moment  they  are  centres  primarily  for  holding  those  denied  a  visa,  waiting  to  go home voluntarily or by force.  The deterrence aspect of these facilities is highlighted by the realisation that none of these persons is eligible for transfer to Villawood or Maribyrnong  where  they  might  have  access  to  visitors  and  be  spared  the horrendous heat and winds of the three select venues.

 Every  fairminded  person  including  the  government's  own  Immigration Detention  Advisory  Group  thinks  that  Woomera  should  have  closed  long  ago. There are less than 130 detainees now in that facility.  It is a hell-hole, dehumanising for  the  detainees  and  the  workers  alike.   But  it  is  our  twenty-first  century  Port Arthur.  Its deterrent value to government is enormous.  It is the jewel in the crown of desert detention. There is no other policy reason for keeping it open.  There is no sensible financial reason for keeping it open.  It is far removed from state services such as Children's services and police.  It is too isolated a place for public servants and  tribunals  comfortably  and  efficiently  to  process  claims  for  refugee  status. DIMIA  sees  an  ongoing  use  for  Woomera   because  this  ensures  that  "we  have  a network  of  centres  in  order  to  best  manage  the  diversity  of  the  detainee  caseload. Retaining  the  Woomera  IRPC  also  makes  possible  the  operation  of  the  alternative housing project for women and children in the Woomera township."15  But let's face it:   Woomera's  main  purpose  now  is  to  emit  a  double  signal  to  would-be  asylum seekers  and  to  fear-filled  voters.   Dispersing  the  130  Woomera  detainees  to  other places would deprive government a precious transmitter.  With the opening of the new Baxter detention facility, the government now has 2,000 beds available in other detention  facilities  and  yet,  given  that  no  boats  have  reached  the  Australian mainland  for  more  than  a  year,  there  are  only  550  in  detention  on  mainland Australia.

 7. The Legal and Political Impossibility of Protecting Children in Detention by Edict from Canberra

 Though Minister Ruddock has had carriage of the portfolio for six years detaining children  with  regret,  he  has  not  yet  concluded  a  satisfactory  memorandum  of understanding  with  any  State  government  for  the  care  of  children  in  the  mainland reception centres.  He has not finalised any document with any Western Australian government regardless of its political persuasion.  He had signed an agreement with the previous Liberal government in South Australia.  But Labor Premier Mike Rann

 

 15 Letter from P. Godwin, DIMIA, to author, 7 August 2002

 Sydney Institute 15

 has  made  clear  that  it  is  not  worth  the  paper  it  is  written  on  when  it  comes  to  the

 interests of children.

 Detention of children in the desert, far removed from regular State children's services and in a political hothouse where there is no agreement between State and Federal  governments  for  the  delivery  of  children's  services  is  a  recipe  for institutionalised child abuse.  On 3 June 2002, Mr Ruddock  wrote to me:

 The  Department  is  working  to  conclude  appropriate  protocols  with  State  child welfare  authorities.   The  aim  of  these  Memoranda  of  Understanding  (MOU)  is  to provide  the  framework  for  collaborative  and  cooperative  relationships  between DIMIA  and  the  State  authorities  and  to  clarify  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the agencies  to  ensure  that  the  best  interests  of  all  children  in  detention  are  met.   A Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  was  signed  last  year  between  my Department and the South Australian Department of Human Services (DHS) relating to  child  protection  notifications  and  child  welfare  issues  pertaining  to  children  in immigration detention in South Australia.

 But  then  on  9  August  2002,  the  Premier  of  South  Australia,  Mr  Rann,  in  a ministerial statement to Parliament said:

 It  is  important  to  note  that  state  child  protection  workers  are  only  allowed  into  the  Centre  with  the permission  of  the  Commonwealth  and  cannot  legally  enforce  their  recommendations  under  South Australia's Child Protection Act as would be possible in other cases concerning children who are not on Commonwealth land.

 …there  is  a  need  for  a  protocol  to  protect  and  remove  children  from  dangerous  situations  within  the compound to protect children seeing traumatic incidents or being harmed in such incidents.

 The following recommendations are made:  That the centres develop a protocol by which children are protected and removed from situations of danger and upset within the compound.  All of the children in such  centres  need  to  be  protected  from  viewing  traumatic  incidents  and  the  risk  of  being  physically harmed during such incidents.  The duty of care to children needs to be effectively managed.

 On  15  August  2002,  the  Attorney  General,  speaking  for  Mr  Ruddock  in  his

 absence, said: "The  Department  has  a  strong  and  cooperative  relationship  with  the South Australian Department of Human Services and works closely with officials to ensure that the best interests of the children are met."  Citizens like myself are left to think that there is no possible co-ordinated government response to child protection while  one  government  remains  committed  to  a  punitive  desert  regime  without  a workable MOU and protocol being in place.  The result must be damage to children. Meanwhile  Mr  Ruddock  says  that  the  relevant  MOU  and  protocol  with  the  South Australian government had been in place for some time.  But in the opinion of the level of government with responsibility for child welfare, there is still a need for a protocol  to  remove  children  from  traumatic  situations.   The  Ruddock  MOU  has produced some very damaged children whom State officials felt powerless to help.

 Sydney Institute 16

 Let  me  give  one  example  of  the  incapacity  of  the  Canberra  bureaucracy  to

 deal credibly with reports of child abuse and neglect in detention, given their need to  pursue  a  hot  political  agenda.   I  communicated  information  about  injuries  to children at Woomera to the Minister and to the Department on 4 April 2002.  Some of this information, including the claim that a seven year old boy was hit with baton and tear gas,  was then published in the Canberra Times on 18 April 2002.  Within six hours, DIMIA had publicly refuted the claim saying, "This department has no record of  injuries  to  a  7-year-old  sustained  during  the  disturbance  at  Woomera  detention facility  on  Good  Friday….  If  Father  Brennan  has  information  or  evidence  of mistreatment  of  detainees  he  should  report  it  to  the  appropriate  authorities  for investigation." I had seen the bruises with my own eyes.  I had heard reports of tear gas  hitting  children  even  from  the  ACM  manager  at  Woomera.    I  lodged  a complaint  about  the  department's  spin  doctoring.   It  took  the  Secretary  of  the department more than three months to conduct the inquiry.  They can do you in in six hours but it takes them over three months to admit their mistakes.  The Acting Secretary  of  the  Department  explained  that  their  public  misinformation  occurred because  "a  number  of  communication  problems  in  the  Department  allowed  the matter  to  escalate  to  the  stage  where  Mr  Foster…posted  inaccurate  information". According  to  the  departmental  inquiry,  this  escalation  took  place  over  four  days. And  yet  the  public  rebuttal  was  issued  within  six  hours  of  the  publication  of  my remarks  -  hardly  any  time  at  all  for  communication  problems  or  escalation  to impede  the  single-minded  objective  of  denying  injury  to  children.   Mr  Ruddock's own chief of staff had referred the matter to the South Australian Family and Youth Services on 29 April 2002, once a new search of medical records revealed there was a problem.  The mother of the boy still has received no report on her complaint.  The cursory  and  dilatory  nature  of  the  Department's  inquiry  invokes  no  public confidence that there will be no recurrence of cover-ups or neglect of credible claims of  injury  to  children  in  detention  in  remote  places  where  they  are  being  used  as  a means to an end.  In this instance, the Commonwealth Department was guilty of a negligent or wilful cover-up regarding the investigation of child abuse in detention centres.   If  children  are  to  be  held  in  detention  with  their  parents,  they  should  be held  in  facilities  where  there  is  ready  access  to  State  Children's  Services  and  the policy  parameters  of  their  detention  should  be  sufficiently  humane  to  win  the support of both the Federal and State governments, regardless of which party is in power.   It  is  obscene  that  defenceless  children  be  used  as  political  footballs  by political spin-doctors.

 8 The Change from Reception and Processing Centres to Removal Centres

 The  situation  in  our  mainland  detention  centres  could  become  more  despairing given the fact that the majority of the detainees have now exhausted all appeals and are awaiting removal.  Some will go voluntarily;  others will not.  The government may eventually be able to force some to leave.  But there is no way they can force the  Afghans  or  Iraqis  to  leave.   I  note  the  news  this  week  that  UNHCR  and  the

 Sydney Institute 17

 Afghan  government  have  reached  agreements  with  the  British  and  French

 governments.   According  to  UNHCR,  "The  emphasis  is  on  voluntary  repatriation, although  the  agreements  also  recognise  that  Afghans  who  are  not  recognised  as refugees  and  who  are  without  current  protection  needs  or  other  humanitarian concerns,  can  legitimately  be  returned  'in  a  closely  co-ordinated,  phased  and humane' process after the end of winter."

 Our government continues to give detained Iraqis a choice between ongoing detention and return to the border of Iraq.  This is an unconscionable choice which could be formulated only by those wanting to clear the Canberra books at all costs. Any  Iraqi  who  is  not  a  security  risk  should  now  be  released  into  the  Australian community until the threat of bombing by us has passed or until the dust from the bombs  has  settled.   To  give  Iraqis  who  fled  the  Hussein  regime  a  choice  between Australian detention at Woomera or Australian bombing at home is an obscenity.

 If  we  continue  to  detain  Afghans,  Iraqis  and  Iranians  without  any  hope  of their being released in to the community, we will be transforming these processing centres  into  punitive  jails  which  labour  under  insuperable  institutional  defects. There  is  no  regime  of  carrots  and  sticks  to  ensure  good  behaviour.   The  well behaved  rejectee  cannot  be  promised  early  release.   The  misbehaving  rejectee cannot  be  threatened  with  the  loss  of  privileges  or  visa.   The  ACM  staff  are  very demoralised, most junior staff now being on short term contracts awaiting the result of  the  new  tender  process.   The  stress  levels  among  staff  at  Woomera  and  Port Hedland  have  been  very  high  of  late.   Last  Friday  while  flying  to  Port  Hedland,  I heard  an  ACM  officer  claim  to  a  member  of  the  public  that  detainees  regularly stabbed ACM officers with sharpened tooth brushes tailor-made to leave the end of the  brush  irretrievable  inside  the  body  of  the  guard.   The  member  of  the  public exclaimed, "We don't want people like that living in Australia!"  I can only presume the guard believed it.  If such an incident had occurred even once, I have no doubt it would have been reported within hours on the DIMIA web site and taken up by at least one talk back radio commentator.

 Meanwhile  200  refugees  have  been  resettled  in  Australia  after  enduring  the added trauma of detention in Nauru and Manus Island where there are still another 1,000  detainees,  300  of  whom  have  been  found  to  be  refugees.   They  must  wait longer  in  detention  while  countries  including  Australia  decide  whether  to  accept them for resettlement.  Last week I met an Afghan TPV holder in Perth.  He spotted his wife and children on television in one of the detention facilities on Nauru. They have  been  found  to  be  refugees.   Given  the  absence  of  ICRC,  no  tracing  had  been possible.  But for their fleeting appearance on the television, they may not have seen each other again.

 9. The Way Ahead

 Messrs Hawke and Wran in their review of the ALP present woes have observed:

 Sydney Institute 18

 No policy issue arose more  frequently  in  our  listening  to  and reading submissions

 from  Party  members  than  that  of  boat  people  and  refugees.  We  suggest  what  we believe  is  the  correct  and  humane  policy  in  this  area.  We  clearly  assert  Labor’s belief that Australia has the right to determine the size of its population intake, who remains in  Australia  and  who  becomes  an Australian  citizen.  Boat  people and refugees  should  be  located  in reasonable  accommodation  and with  humane treatment in the natural holding area of Christmas Island and, on  completion  of  the new facility, John Howard’s diaspora of the desperate around the Pacific should be located  there.  The unacceptable  detention  centres on  the  Australian  mainland, like Woomera,  can  then  be  closed. Increased  resources  would  be applied  to processing  these people  as  rapidly  as  possible  and those  judged  to  be

 genuine refugees  would  be  admitted  to Australia  under  an  enhanced refugee program.  Through negotiations  with  our  neighbours and  a  strengthened coastguard service  everything  possible would  be  done  to  stem  the illegal  and inhumane  trade  in boat  people.  We  would  negotiate with  the  appropriate national  and  international  authorities  to secure  the  return  to  their homelands  of those  judged  not to  be  genuine  refugees. Australia  needs  to  rid  itself  of a conservative government that is divisive at home and subservient abroad.  

 I do not think this compromise is good enough.  The Christmas Island facility would  be  a  sensible  place  to  detain  those  coming  by  boat  without  valid  travel documents but only for a limited time (say 14 days) to establish health, security and identity  issues.   Thereafter  any  asylum  seekers  whose  claims  are  not  manifestly unfounded should be transferred to the mainland and housed in processing centres which are located in places suited to the processing of claims and to the delivery of services.   Additional  detention  should  be  permitted  only  if  the  asylum  applicant had  the  opportunity  to  apply  to  a  court  for  bail.   If  parents  are  to  be  kept  in detention,  they  should  have  the  option  of  handing  their  accompanying  children  to the  other  parent  or  close  relatives  who  have  visas  to  reside  in  Australia.   They should also be able to enlist the services of the State child care agencies to arrange parent-approved fostering for the length of detention should that be their wish.

 In the months ahead, the government will be tempted to return to detention those  TPV  holders  whose  visas  have  now  expired  and  whose  renewed  asylum claims will be rejected because of changed circumstances especially in Afghanistan. If  the  government  sees  through  such  a  policy,  these  detention  centres  will  become even  more  gross  centres  of  despair  -  removal  centres  in  the  middle  of  the  desert inhabited  by  Afghans  who  have  no  assurance  that  the  changes  back  home  are substantial,  effective  and  durable,  making  it  safe  for  them  to  return.   Given  that these applicants were found to be refugees three years ago, it must be conceded that if they had entered Australia on (say) a student visa, they would have been eligible for a permanent protection visa three years ago.  Surely it is fairer that they continue to be treated as refugees (whatever the minutiae of our visa requirements) until the government  can  genuinely  be  satisfied  of  a  change  of  conditions  in  Afghanistan warranting  the  invocation  of  the  Cessation  Clause  (Article  1C)  of  the  Refugee

 Convention.   If  the  government  is  to  insist  that  the  4,000  Afghan  and  Iraqi  TPV

 holders whose visas come up for reassessment in the next nine months prove again that  they  are  refugees,  it  is  imperative  that  the  applicants  once  again  be  provided with  at  least  the  same  level  of  legal  assistance  they  were  provided  at  the  time  of their  initial  applications.   Three  years  ago,  it  was  easy  for  an  Hazara  to  prove persecution  under  the  Taliban  regime.   This  does  not  mean  that  such  an  applicant might not face other persecution if returning home now.  To establish such a claim would  require  painstaking  research,  especially  given  the  applicant's  three  or  four year  absence  from  home.   Also  there  are  the  complex  questions  whether  the applicant is now eligible for a permanent or temporary visa depending on whether he or she was continuously resident in a place where UNHCR or country protection could have been invoked.

 To  date  the  mandatory  detention  regime  has  been  acceptable  to  the Australian  public  because  the  detainees  were  so  "other",  so  faceless  and  so unknown.   It  is  an  altogether  different  matter  for  government  to  march  off  young Afghans  from  the  abattoirs  where  they  have  been  working  and  from  the  soccer pitches  on  which  they  have  triumphed  these  last  three  years  back  to  the  desert Gulag - all in the name of border protection when only one boat person has reached land without a visa this last year.  The regime has also been acceptable because the government has been prepared to allow the harshest manifestations of the policy to be  mitigated  by  the  issue  of  bridging  visas  to  unaccompanied  minors  and  by  the legal fiction of ongoing detention for some young persons in the company of a carer in  a  capital  city.   But  the  cost  to  these  young  people  has  been  the  arbitrary deprivation of liberty, curtailing their capacity to catch public transport to school or even to attend a school or course of their choice.  If the government were concerned for the well-being of these Afghan unaccompanied minors in our midst, rather than simply  offering  them  a  cash  payment  to  return  home,  why  not  attend  to  their  real concern.  Most of them have written numerous letters home but received no reply. Why does the government not send one of its officers together with a person trusted by the unaccompanied minors to seek out their families and to bring back news so that  the  minors  might  make  an  informed  choice  whether  to  return?   And  if  this service  can  be  provided  for  unaccompanied  minors,  why  not  for  other  Afghans whom the government wishes to depart our shores?

 Recently I visited the memorial at the Changi war prison and I realised that  the  abuses  of  detention  are  always  the  more  aggravated  when  the  jailers  are people of another race.  Most of the Afghans and Iraqis held in these desert camps have  been  proved  to  be  refugees  with  every  right  to  be  integrated  into  the Australian community.  What have we done to each of them?  What have we done to ourselves?   The  Europeans  and  Americans  will  not  be  copying  us  because  our solution could only be designed by an island continent nation at the end of the earth that  does  not  have  much  of  a  problem.   Australia  has  designed  a  large  sledge hammer for a small nut.  It is a hammer which would wreak havoc in those countries with  significant  asylum  seeker  populations.   It  requires  geographic  isolation, mendicant  island  neighbours,  and  a  compliant,  unaccountable  police  force  next

 door.   It  also  requires  plenty  of  space  and  a  politicised  public  who  will  not  be

 perturbed  to  learn,  to  quote  the  Minister's  modulated  phraseology,  "  The  longest recorded  period  for  any  minor  asylum  seeker  in  detention  was  1998  days.  This minor would now be 12 years old, is the child of the above female and was included in  the  same  application.  Immigration  detention  ceased  29 days  after  the  family member’s  litigation  was  completed."16   It  remains  only  to  add  that  the  litigation resulted in the issue of a visa to the family member.

 If  we  broke  the  nexus  between  on  shore  asylum  processing  and  off  shore acceptance of persons in need of humanitarian assistance (a legislative construct of the  present  government),  we  would  expose  the  cant  of  those  government propagandists  who  claim  to  be  committed  to  maximum  humanitarian  outcomes. Having been at Woomera over Easter, I say again that it is no place for kids, nor for their  parents,  nor  for  the  ACM  and  DIMIA  officers  all  of  whom  are  stressed  and dehumanised by such unnecessary suffering.
