 SENATOR JOE LUDWIG  Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs  9 August 2006 

 FOR MEDIA   

 MINISTER LEAVES REAL QUESTIONS ON MOTHERSHIP  UNANSWERED   

 

 Today the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, tried to defend the  tender released by Customs for a detention mother ship but left all the real  questions unanswered.   

 In response to a Dorothy Dixer asked in Question Time today, the Minister  delivered a limp defence for his latest bandaid to a patchwork border protection  policy.   

 Labor wants the Minister to clarify details about the proposal, which should be in  the tender documents.   

 The questions the Minister has left unanswered are: 

 1.  Will detainees be kept on board for up to thirty days? 

 2. How will the government guarantee access to legal advice for  detainees out at sea? 

 3. Will asylum seekers be detained along side illegal fishers? 

 4. Will women and children be held in the same cells as other detainees  and how will their welfare be protected? 

 5. What extra security will be in place specifically for high-risk detainees? 

 6. What training will the civilian crew have on a ship that carries an  armoury packed with weapons and explosives?   

 The Minister banged on about Labor's plans for a Coast Guard.  But all he  showed was that Labor is the only party with a coordinated approach to border  protection.   

 This Government keeps hiring boats in an ad hoc manner, when what we need is  a Coast Guard that's part of a fully integrated border protection agency.
