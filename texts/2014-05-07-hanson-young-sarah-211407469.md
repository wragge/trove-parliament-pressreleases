 MEDIA RELEASE

 Abbott Government broken people smuggling  laws? AFP must investigate   

 The Australian Greens will write to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Tony  Negus, urging the agency to investigate the possibility of illegal activities being undertaken as a  part of the Abbott Government’s Operation Sovereign Borders.   

 “These latest allegations are very serious and may represent a breach of Australian domestic  law. They must be investigated,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said today.   

 “Transferring people who were in Australia’s jurisdiction to a boat bound for Indonesia is legally  questionable.   

 “The Abbott Government’s reckless behaviour has brought into question its compliance with  section 73 of the Criminal Code Act.   

 “Under Australian law, the maximum penalty for a conviction of people smuggling is 10 years in  prison.   

 “The simple fact of the matter is that the Australian Government wouldn’t be in this position if it  wasn’t so obsessed with punishing refugees.   

 “These dangerous and illegal tow-backs are damaging the relationship with Indonesia and  putting Australian service men and women at risk.”
