 ABBOTT DOORSTOP - ADELAIDE 

 The Hon Tony Abbott MP  

 Leader of the Opposition 

 Subjects: Young Liberals National Conference, better management of the Murray-Darling basin, South Australian 

 election, Nick Xenophon.  

 E&OE  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 It’s great to be here in Adelaide, it’s good to be at the Young Liberals National Conference. This is something that 

 I really have tried to make an annual event for me.  

 Environmental issues are very, very important, particularly here in Adelaide and really the one issue that matters 

 above all else in this city and in this state is water. Now, the Rudd Government has been procrastinating on 

 water. The Rudd Government has been all talk and no action on this as on so many other issues. There has 

 been no serious progress towards managing better the water resources of the Murray-Darling basin over the last 

 two years. (inaudible)…will work as far as we can with the State Governments but if that proves to be impossible, 

 we will have a referendum because in the end the Murray-Darling is too important to be left to the parochialism of 

 the States. The Murray-Darling is a national asset and it should be managed by the national government.  

 QUESTION:  

 So, are you saying that a Federal Liberal Government would take powers away from the State Governments to 

 veto the Murray-Darling Authority, for example?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 If necessary, to ensure that this water is properly managed in everyone’s interests, yes we will.  

 QUESTION:  

 Do you get a lot of resistance from New South Wales and Victoria?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 I think more than ever before Australians think of themselves as citizens of a country rather than of six states and 

 I think that Australians understand that it’s just commonsense that a catchment extending over four states should 

 be managed by the national government. You can’t have governments in Sydney, in Melbourne, in Brisbane 

 making decisions that impact on the citizens of Adelaide when those governments are in no way accountable to 

 the people of South Australia.  

 QUESTION:  

 How confident are you that the referendum will even be passed?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 I know that the conventional wisdom is that referendums fail but I think Australians are better than that. I think 

 that if you put a good case to the Australian people, they’ll give you credit.  

 QUESTION:  

 We’re only really a dot compared to the three eastern states that I guess control the upper part of the river. Why 

 do you think it will be passed…  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Look this idea that Sydneysiders and people in Melbourne are careless of the rights of others I just reject. I think 

 that wherever you are in Australia today, people are conscious of being Australians. I think people understand 

 that a river catchment extending across four states has to be managed by the national Government. It’s too 

 important to be left to the parochialism of the States and whether you’re living in Adelaide or Melbourne or 

 Sydney or Brisbane, I think people understand that now.  

 QUESTION:  

 You said that popular candidates can be unsettled by protest votes. Is water going to be one of those protest 

 issues for those candidates?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 I think that people are starting to understand that the Rudd Government is all talk and no action. I think that Mr 

 Rudd will certainly go into the next election as the favourite but I think that’s likely to create a fair bit of 

 complacency on his part. He’s already starting to look smug and self-satisfied and I think that the Australian 

 public like to take down politicians that look like they’ve got too big for their boots.  

 QUESTION:  

 What about the state Liberals who’ve got an election coming up in seven weeks? How would you rate their 

 performance?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Well, as I said, I think the Australian public like to take down a peg or two politicians who have got too big for their 

 boots and I think that the Rann Government has got complacent in office. I think that Isobel Redmond is an 

 authentic person. She’s genuine, she’s down to earth, she’s fair dinkum, she strikes me as someone who you 

 can rely on and I think the South Australian public are looking for someone like that.  

 QUESTION:  

 You met with her this morning. What advice did you offer her?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Well, it wasn’t a question of me giving her advice. It was a question of talking about the issues and like all 

 Liberals, we believe in more effective government, government which actually solves peoples’ problems and 

 doesn’t engage in constant spin. So that was what we were talking about and certainly we both think that the 

 Murray-Darling has got to be much better managed and I was really pleased to have her support on a national 

 approach to managing Murray-Darling water.  

 QUESTION:  

 (inaudible)  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 A result is guaranteed. A result is guaranteed. We will get national control of the Murray-Darling basin. Now if we 

 can get it by reference of power, that’s fine. But if we can’t get it that way, then we will have a referendum 

 because what we need is sensible management of this most precious resource in the interests of all Australians. 

 It’s got to be managed in the national interest, not in the parochial interest. Okay, that’s it? Thanks so much.  

 QUESTION:  

 Could we also ask about Nick Xenophon’s proposal…  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Okay…  

 QUESTION:  

 …for penalising people who lie about their age to minors?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Sure. Well look, I think his intentions are good. I have had a good working relationship with Senator Xenophon in 

 the brief time that I’ve been the federal Opposition Leader. I think that it’s an admirable sentiment. Yes, we 

 should try to ensure that predators can’t prey on people via the internet and obviously I’d have to look at the 

 details of the bill but certainly I’m happy to support the objective.  

 QUESTION:  

 Also with the two Australian refugee activists that were in Indonesia, they’ve been detained and deported. What’s 

 your thoughts on that? Have they done the right thing?  

 TONY ABBOTT:  

 Look, I’m not aware of the circumstances and generally speaking what happens in Indonesia is a matter for the 

 Indonesian Government. Okay? Thanks so much.
