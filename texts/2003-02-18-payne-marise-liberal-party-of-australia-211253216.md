 MARISE PAYNE  Senator for New South Wales 

 

 Media release 

 

 APPLICATIONS OPEN FOR SETTLEMENT SERVICES FUNDING  

 (18/02/03)  

 

 Western Sydney Based Senator Marise Payne announced today that funding  administered by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous  Affairs under the Commonwealth Settlement Services Scheme (CSSS) is now  available to community organisations providing settlement services for refugees,  humanitarian entrants, and migrants. 

 Priority will be given to applications that address the settlement needs of: 

 · refugee and humanitarian entrants except those in the immediate post-arrival period  who are eligible for specialised services provided under DIMIA's Integrated  Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS); · small and emerging communities; ·  migrants living in rural and remote communities; and · migrants with additional,  specific settlement needs.  

 Senator Payne said, "Applications addressing these needs must clearly identify the  characteristics and/or experiences which cause the client groups to have greater than  usual settlement difficulties. 

 "Proposals must address settlement needs which are not already being met by current  CSSS funding or by other agencies," Senator Payne said.  

 In addressing the needs of the target groups, priority will be given to proposals for  services which: 

 · facilitate client access to mainstream services; · develop settlement planning and  service delivery networks that engage mainstream service providers to develop  culturally appropriate services; · aim to be self-sustaining within a specific period.  

 Senator Payne said, "Organisations are encouraged to maximise the use of their  resources and expertise by considering consortium proposals for collaborative service  provision to a number of communities or groups across a region". 

 Details of eligibility, assessment and financial and management requirements are set  out in the Applicant Information Kit, which is available on the DIMIA web site:  http://www.immi.gov.au/grants  

 A copy of the Guidelines for Funded Organisations is also available on the web site.  A help desk for applicants wishing to apply on-line is available on 1800 453 004. 

 The Applicant Information Kit can be obtained from DIMIA State and Territory  offices. These offices are holding information sessions for applicants; general  inquiries can be made on 1800 453 003.  

 Applications must be lodged by 5.00pm local time on Friday 21 March 2003 with the  Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Canberra.
