 Tough border protection strategy working to detect unauthorised arrivals   

 Yesterday’s detection by the Australian Customs Service of the unauthorised arrival of 15  people at Ashmore Islands proves that the Government’s tough border protection strategies are  working, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Chris Ellison, said today.   

 “Customs has maintained a permanent operational presence at the islands since 1999 using its  fleet of patrol boats, and it was one of these vessels, the Dame Roma Mitchell, which detected  the unauthorised arrivals,” Senator Ellison said.   

 “Customs conducts regular patrols of the islands and surrounding Australian waters,” he said.   

 “There is always a vessel on duty in this high-traffic area, and that’s why we were able to find  these people so quickly.”   

 Ashmore Islands lie approximately 320 kilometres off our north west coast, but only 144  kilometres south of the Indonesian island of Roti.   

 “Under an agreement between Australia and Indonesia, traditional fishing is permitted by  Indonesian fishers and consequently, there are a large number of fishing boats operating legally  which have to be constantly checked.   

 “This vast area is a challenge to patrol, but this detection proves that we are successfully  protecting Australia’s borders,” Senator Ellison said.   

 Interviews by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMIA) and the  Australian Federal Police (AFP) with the 15 unauthorised arrivals are continuing.
