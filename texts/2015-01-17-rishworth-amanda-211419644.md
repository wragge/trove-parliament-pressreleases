 AMANDA RISHWORTH MP 

 ACTING SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR KINGSTON   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 PETER DUTTON HAS QUESTIONS TO ANSWER    

 Concerning claims about violence at the Manus Island Regional Processing Centre  need to be addressed urgently by the Abbott Government.    

 The allegations of clashes between detainees and guards that have been reported  today by the ABC are deeply worrying.    

 Peter Dutton needs to explain exactly what is happening at the Australian funded  facility. We can't risk another serious incident taking place on this Government's  watch, like what happened almost 12 months ago and resulted in the death of 23-year-old Reza Berati.    

 We need the full facts of what is going on at the Manus Regional Processing Centre.    

 The Abbott Government has an appalling track record when it comes to being up  front with the Australian people about matters relating to immigration.    

 The Australian people need to be assured the facility is being run in a safe manner.   

 Asylum seekers must be treated in a dignified, humane manner and the Abbott  Government needs to make sure they are housed in a safe environment.
