 SUNRAYSIA TO BENEFIT FROM $24,720 FOR MIGRANT SETTLEMENT

 John Forrest, Federal Member for Mallee today announced that Sunraysia Ethnic Communities Council (SECC) Inc of Mildura has been awarded funding totalling $24,720 to assist migrants, refugees and humanitarian entrants settle quickly and effectively in to the local community.

 Mr Forrest said the funding would be subject to the SECC agreement and continuing compliance with service agreements, which will include clearly defined work programmes.

 Mr Forrest said, "The settlement services to be supported by the funding will include extension of its mobile outreach service to the areas surrounding Sunraysia; identification of settlement needs within the emerging ethnic communities of the area; developing a mainstream model of service delivery to improve access to services and provide support and providing information to emerging communities within the Robinvale and Swan Hill areas.

 "Migrants moving into regional areas are often faced with unique hurdles to overcome and support services may be harder to access. In cities, migrants often have family networks and friends who have migrated before them for support.

 "This grant will assist those who come to the Sunraysia district to settle into the community, contribute their skills and share their unique culture for the benefit of the whole region.

 "he principal objective of settlement services is to contribute to the adjustment by migrants and humanitarian entrants to life in Australia so that they can achieve independence and participate fully in Austlian society soon after their arrival.

 SECC will play an important role in this process by providing their clients with advice and support which will equip them to enter the broader community confidently and to avail themselves of the opportunities and services available to all Australians", Mr Forrest said.
