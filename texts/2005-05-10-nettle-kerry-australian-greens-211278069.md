 Senator Kerry Nettle  Senator for New South Wales 

 Greens move to censure Immigration  Minister 

 10th May 2005 

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle, will give notice today of a motion to  censure the Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone.  "The Minister deserves censure for her inability to deal openly and  effectively with the serious, potentially criminal acts of her department  in relation to detention of asylum seekers, the mistreatment of the  mentally ill in the Department's care, and the deportation of citizens  and non-citizens into danger," Senator Nettle said.  "The latest revelations regarding the deportation of a mentally ill  Australian citizen to the Philippines follow a series of serious breaches  that indicate a department out of control.  "The Palmer inquiry is not a public inquiry and lacks the powers that a  royal commission has, and as such is clearly inadequate to address the  systemic problems that beset the Department of Immigration and its  contractors.  "The Minister needs to take responsibility for failures of her  department.   "If half of what's been reported in the media about these immigration  scandals is found to be true then the Minister should resign."  DRAFT Censure Motion:  I give notice that on the next day of sitting I shall move that The 

 Senate censure the Minister for Immigration for   (a) Her failure;  (i) to instigate a full judicial public inquiry into  the manifest failure of her department to fulfil  its duty of care to those in its responsibility.  (ii) to manage the timely and humane processing of  asylum seekers.  (iii) abide by the letter and spirit of the  international conventions relating to the treatment of children.  (iv) to admit responsibility for the wrongful  detention of at least 33 people and the illegal deportation 

 of at least one Australian citizen.  (v) to take any steps to monitor the safety of  asylum seeker deportees deported from Australia by her department.  (vi) to take her accountability responsibilities  seriously.
