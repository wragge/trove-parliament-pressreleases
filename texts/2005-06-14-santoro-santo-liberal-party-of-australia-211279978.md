 Govt arrogance stops debate on skills shortage     

  The government gave an indication of how it will manage its control of both houses of parliament  today by arrogantly shutting down debate on critical skilled workforce bill before at least ten  members had spoken, according to Peter Andren, Member for Calare. 

 

 “The skills crisis in this country has been one of the most talked about issues over the last 18  months and the government shuts down debate on its so-called solution, denying ten members, and  their electorates, their say,” Mr Andren said.   

 “This is democracy at its worst and I hate to think this is what we can expect from the Howard  government when it takes control of the Senate in two weeks.   

 “The bills dealt with the government’s plan to combat the shortage of skilled workers in essential  trades in this country - but it is a flawed plan.   

 “I was gagged as I tried to speak on a government amendment to correct an embarrassing mistake it  made in the draft of their ill-considered legislation.   

 “This so-called drafting error gave the game away. It said TAFEs would need to be more  commercial ‘to enable government funding to be reduced’.   

 “The government will dismantle the very successful and independent Australian National Training  Authority which has developed a consistent vocational education and training system across the  country.   

 “ANTA worked because included all players - industry, government, unions and the trainers, and  distributed funding where it was needed.   

 “The government itself acknowledged that ANTA was successful and had established a ‘truly  national vocational education and training system … with industry leadership’.   

 “The bills give the Commonwealth direct control over where VET funding goes, and attaches a raft  of conditions such as forcing its workplace agenda on TAFE, and channelling public money to  private training providers. 

 

 “It’s an ideological strait-jacket for the states and territories if they do not want to lose what  amounts to a third of their total funding needs for VET and TAFE.   

 “The bills are an unnecessary meddling with a funding and training framework that has proven  extremely successful over the last decade.   

 “ANTA is not responsible for the skills shortage which results from government and industry  reluctance to invest in real apprenticeships. The structure to combat the problem is already there and  just needs government behind it.   

 The government’s performance today in shutting down debate on a flawed piece of legislation  shows it will stop at nothing to push its ideological agenda ahead of proper debate resulting in  policy that benefits all Australians,” Mr Andren said.
