 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 10 April 2013   

 Asylum arrivals should be met with care, not  hysteria   

 We should be caring for the 66 people who arrived in Geraldton yesterday, not using them to score  cheap political points and spread baseless concerns within the community, the Australian Greens  said today.   

 “The usual suspects are using this situation to whip up fear and hatred in the community,” the  Greens immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Tony Abbott’s claims of Australia ‘surrendering’ and Scott Morrison’s declaration that our coast is  ‘open slather’ for asylum seekers are intentionally hyperbolic and clearly not aimed at saving lives at  sea.   

 “The people who arrived on Monday should not be taken to Christmas Island when it would be far  cheaper, easier and more humane to process their claims for protection on the mainland.   

 “I welcome the review into interception protocols but am concerned that there was no coronial  inquiry undertaken, as I suggested, two weeks ago when a four-year-old died at sea.”
