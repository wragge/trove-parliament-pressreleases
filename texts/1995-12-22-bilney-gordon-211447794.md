 AUSTRALIA RESPONDS TO WINTER APPEAL  FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA

 Australia will provide $1.5 million to help meet urgent humanitarian needs in the former  Yugoslavia, the Minister for Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney, said today.

 Australia's contribution will help the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  (UNHCR) to continue to provide food, shelter and other assistance to people displaced by the  conflict. UNHCR is the lead agency providing humanitarian assistance in the former 

 Yugoslavia.

 The announcement comes as Australia attends a two day meeting in Brussels, sponsored by  the World Bank and the European Union, to identify the priorities for the massive  reconstruction effort needed in the former Yugoslavia.

 "Now that the Dayton Peace Agreement is in place, the international community can consider  options for the rehabilitation and repair of a region devastated by four years of war," Mr  Bilney said.

 "While this planning takes place, we cannot ignore the pressing needs during the winter  months of over 3 million people, many of whom have lost their families, homes and  livelihoods."

 Mr Bilney said the $1.5 million contribution brings the Australian Government's  humanitarian assistance to the former Yugoslavia, through AusAID, to $5 million this year.
