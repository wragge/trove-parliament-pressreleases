 Refugee and Humanitarian Program - helping those  most in need

 VPS 88/2004

 Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone, today announced the Government had exceeded  expectations in its Refugee and Humanitarian Program, granting more than 13,200 visas.

 'This demonstrates the Government's strong commitment to providing places for genuine refugees under the  Refugee and Humanitarian Program,' Senator Vanstone said.

 'A total of 13,221 visas have been granted so far in 2003-04 and visas will continue to be granted through until  the end of the financial year.

 'Eighty five per cent, or 11,227 visas have been granted offshore, ensuring that the majority of our effort  targets those in greatest need of resettlement, like people in the UNHCR's refugee camp, Kakuma, in Kenya.

 'Of these, 3,991 have been granted under the Refugee Program and 7,236 under the Special Humanitarian  Program.

 'The remaining 15 per cent of the total visas granted, comprise 748 onshore visas. In addition Ministerial  intervention powers have been used to grant 1,223 visas to East Timorese in Australia and 23 visas to other  persons with Humanitarian needs.

 'The flexibility of the Program allows the Government to move places between years. For example, any  unfilled capacity in one financial year is carried into the following financial year and if places are required in  excess of those available, places can be brought forward from future years.

 'The success of the Government's border protection measures has limited onshore demand for visa protection,  with 771 protection visas being granted so far in 2003-04, the lowest figure since 1996. 

 'This means Australia's efforts are being directed to those most in need. Australians can be proud that they are  offering resettlement to the most needy.

 'The majority, 75 per cent, of offshore visas have been granted to people from Africa. These are people who  have no other option but resettlement through the international resettlement program coordinated by UNHCR.

 'The success of the Government's border control program means we can invest more into the offshore  program. From 2004-05, the Refugee and Humanitarian Program will increase to 13,000 places. Within the 

 Program, the Refugee category will increase by 2,000 places to 6,000.

 'New initiatives announced in the recent budget, provide increased support under the Humanitarian Program  including Government funding for medical expenses of all Special Humanitarian Program entrants and a one-off payment of $2.5 million to establish a community-based no-interest loans scheme to assist Special  Humanitarian Program visa holders to travel to Australia.'
