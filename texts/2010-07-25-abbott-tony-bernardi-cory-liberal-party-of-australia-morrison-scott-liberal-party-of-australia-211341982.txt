 JOINT PRESS RELEASE 

 THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR, LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  MR. SCOTT MORRISON MHR,   SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP  SENATOR CORY BERNARDI,   SHADOW PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND 

 POPULATION POLICY 

 

 

 REAL ACTION ON SUSTAINABLE POPULATION GROWTH   

 

 Australia needs a population that our services can satisfy, our infrastructure can support, our environment  can sustain, our society can embrace, and our economy can employ.    

 Australia's population growth since World War II has helped create the prosperity we now enjoy. Successive  waves of post-war migration have expanded our capacity as a nation.    

 Under the Howard Government, our immigration programme enjoyed support from a majority of  Australians who were confident that the programme was fair, competently administered, and delivering  benefits to the entire community.    

 Under Labor, migration-fuelled population growth has caused Australians to become increasingly  concerned, and to lose confidence in our broader immigration programme.    

 The hopeless failure of Labor’s border protection regime has further eroded community trust.   

 Under Labor, net overseas migration has risen to 300,000 people per year, against a long run average of  around 140,000 per year.    

 At this rate Australia’s population would reach 42.3 million people by 2050, significantly above the earlier  Intergenerational Report II (IGR) forecast of 36 million.   

 As a result, the quality of life for Australians living in our major urban areas today is under great pressure.  

 Fuelling population growth today must not rob future generations of the quality of life and opportunities we  currently enjoy. That is what sustainability is all about.   

 On the eve of an election, Labor politicians have suddenly started to say they no longer believe in a “big  Australia” - while cynically trying to put off any decisions on these issues until after the election.    

 While Labor may have changed its rhetoric under its new leader, Labor’s policies on immigration or  population have not changed.  

 

 The Coalition believes it is necessary to ease population growth to deliver more sustainable population  levels, based on our present and future capacity, so that our infrastructure, services and environment can  catch up.    

 Unlike Labor, the Coalition’s population and immigration policy is clear.    

 The Coalition will:   

 1. Establish ‘Guard Rails’ for Population Growth   

 The Coalition will set clear parameters for population growth by tasking a renamed Productivity and  Sustainability Commission to advise on population growth bands that it considers are sustainable.   

 This recommendation will provide a Coalition Government with the expert advice necessary to establish  the framework for setting migration programmes.    

 2. Take Real Action on Immigration   

 The Coalition will reduce Australia’s annual rate of population growth from more than 2 per cent under  Labor, to our historical long-run average of 1.4 per cent within our first term.    

 This will require reducing our annual rate of net overseas migration from 298,924 in 2008/09 to no  more than 170,000 per year by the end of our first term.    

 3. Make a Clear Commitment to Skills Migration and Regional Australia.   

 The Coalition will ensure that two-thirds of our permanent migration programme will be for the  purposes of skilled migration.   

 A Coalition Government will also quarantine the level of employer nominated skills migration and 457  temporary business visas to at least the levels it inherits. In addition, the Coalition will liberalise  arrangements for temporary business visas (457s) subject to clear standards, to make them more  accessible to business, especially small businesses, and business in regional areas, with proven skills  shortage needs.   

 To address the skills needs of regional areas and small business, the Coalition will encourage the  settlement on either a temporary or permanent basis of new arrivals in regional and rural areas.    

 States such as Queensland and Western Australia will be afforded a high priority for permanent and  temporary skilled visa applications.     

 A Coalition Government would also seek to resettle more entrants from our refugee and humanitarian  programme in regional areas, where these resettlement programmes have proved to be highly  successful.    

 4.  Establish A Clear and Consultative Process to Restore Control   

 The Coalition will produce a White Paper on immigration that will reframe the structure and  composition of Australia’s immigration programme to address the policy challenges of sustainable  population growth.   

 

 A Discussion Paper will be released by the end of 2010, with a final paper to be completed by the  Coalition’s first Budget in May 2011. This will help inform the composition of the 2011-12 migration  programme.    

 Australians want their government to take control of population and immigration policies to restore  confidence and ensure our immigration and population levels are sustainable and in the national interest.   

 The Coalition’s plan for Real Action on Sustainable Population Growth will restore confidence and re-establish consensus on the benefits of our immigration programme.

 The Coalition’s Policy for  Population and Immigration

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Coalition believes Australia needs a population that our services can satisfy, our infrastructure  can support, our environment can sustain, our society can embrace and our economy can employ. 

 Australians living in our major urban areas today are experiencing growing pains. The impact  on their quality of life caused by services and infrastructure failing to cope and an environment  under stress, cannot be ignored. 

 The Coalition’s record of strong economic management demonstrates we are committed to  growing Australia’s economy. However, prosperity should not be won at the cost of sacrificing  our quality of life. As a result, we cannot allow population growth to become a lazy substitute for  improving productivity and participation to achieve economic gains.   

 Fuelling population growth today must not rob future generations of the quality of life and  opportunities we currently enjoy. That is what sustainability is all about.

 The Coalition believes Australians are looking for up-front, sustained investment in infrastructure  and services before they will support higher increases in population. 

 The Coalition will:

 1.	 Establish ‘Guard Rails’ for Population Growth

 The Coalition will set clear parameters for population growth by tasking a renamed  Productivity and Sustainability Commission to advise on population growth bands  considered sustainable. This advice will provide the framework for setting migration  programmes. 

 2.	 Take Real Action on Immigration

 The Coalition will reduce Australia’s annual rate of population growth from more than 2  per cent under Labor, to our historical long-run average of 1.4 per cent within our first term.  This will require reducing our annual rate of net overseas migration from 298,924 in 2008-09 to no more than 170,000 per year by the end of our first term. 

 3.	 Make a Clear Commitment to Skills Migration and Regional Australia. 

 The Coalition will ensure that two-thirds of our permanent migration programme   will be for the purposes of skilled migration. 

 A Coalition Government will also quarantine the level of employer nominated skills  migration and temporary business visas (457s) to at least the levels it inherits.  In  addition, the Coalition will seek to liberalise arrangements for temporary business visas  (457s) subject to clear standards, to make them more accessible to business, especially  small businesses, and business in regional areas with proven skills shortage needs.

 To address the skills needs of regional areas and small business we will encourage the  settlement on either a temporary or permanent basis of new arrivals in regional and rural  areas. States such as Queensland and Western Australia will be afforded a high priority for  permanent and temporary skilled visa applications.

 A Coalition Government will also seek to resettle more entrants from our refugee and  humanitarian programme in regional areas, where resettlement programmes have proven  to be highly successful. 

 4.	 Establish A Clear and Consultative Process to Restore Control

 The Coalition will commit to the production of a White Paper on immigration that will  reframe the structure and composition of Australia’s immigration programme to address  the policy challenges of sustainable population growth.

 BACKGROUND Immigration has made the Australia we know today. 

 Australia’s population growth since World War II has helped create the prosperity we now enjoy.  Successive waves of post-war migration have expanded our capacity as a nation. 

 Today, 45 per cent of Australians were born overseas or have at least one parent who was born  overseas. 

 While acknowledging our past successes, these do not justify a population ‘blank cheque’ for the  future.

 The Intergenerational Report (IGR) process initiated by the Coalition through former Treasurer  Peter Costello was one of the most forward-thinking planning initiatives undertaken by an  Australian Government. The IGR forced Australians to confront the realities of our changing  demography. 

 The implications for our economy, national finances, environmental sustainability, food production,  infrastructure, service needs, housing and overall quality of life have all now been put under the  spotlight. 

 The release of the most recent IGR, projecting a two-thirds increase in our population to 36 million  by 2050, caused many to stop and think about whether this level of growth was sustainable.  

 The long-term answer for sustainable population growth lies in:

 â¢	 Investing in our capacity for growth - in our services, our infrastructure, the management  of our environment and the like; and 

 â¢	 Improving the dispersal of our population to meet the needs of underpopulated areas that  could benefit from higher levels of growth.

 Until significant progress is made in these areas, however, continued escalation of our population  at current growth rates will serve only to exacerbate the problems we seek to solve. 

 Easing population growth to more sustainable levels is necessary to support our broader efforts  to enable our infrastructure, services and environment to catch up. This requires leadership and  a Government willing to address Australia’s current rate of immigration intake.

 Australia’s population is currently experiencing high levels of growth:

 â¢	 At the end of 2009, Australia’s population grew at the rate of one additional person every  73 seconds;

 â¢	 A population growth rate of 2 per cent in 2009 makes Australia one of the fastest-growing   countries in the developed world, higher than Canada, the United States, United Kingdom,  as well as China, India, Indonesia and Malaysia; and

 â¢	 Global population growth is 1.2 per cent, while the growth rate in OECD countries averages  at around 0.7 per cent.  

 T H E  C O A L I T I O N ’ S  P O L I C Y  F O R  P O P U L AT I O N  A N D  I M M I G R AT I O N              5

 Our population growth rate has not always been so high. Over the last forty years Australia’s  population has grown at an average of 1.4 per cent. During the Coalition’s eleven years in  government from 1996 to 2007, Australia’s rate of population growth was slightly below this long  term trend. 

 To get our immigration programme under control we must appreciate what is driving our current  population growth.

 Net overseas migration now accounts for two-thirds of population growth, the highest on record.  

 T H E  C O A L I T I O N ’ S  P O L I C Y  F O R  P O P U L AT I O N  A N D  I M M I G R AT I O N              6

 HOW LABOR HAS FAILED When the Coalition was last in government our immigration programme enjoyed support  from a majority of Australians who were confident that the programme was fair, competently  administered - and delivering benefits to the entire community. At the same time, our economy  grew, interest rates were low, our standard of living improved and more than 2 million new jobs  were created. 

 Today, migration-fuelled population growth has caused Australians to become increasingly  concerned and to lose confidence in our broader immigration programme. The hopeless failure  of Labor’s border protection polices has compounded these concerns and further eroded  community trust.

 Under Labor, net overseas migration has risen to 300,000 people per year, against a long run  average of around 140,000 per year. According to respected demographer, Professor Bob Birrell,  Australia’s current rate of net overseas migration will deliver a population of 42.3 million people  by 2050, significantly above the IGR forecast of 36 million.

 The Australian Bureau of Statistics also predicts a ‘Big Australia’ of more than 40 million people,  based on similar assumptions of high net overseas migration. This includes a Sydney of 7.3 million  - up 64 per cent, a Melbourne of 7.5 million - up 92 per cent, a Brisbane of 4.5 million - up 135 per  cent, and a Perth of 3.9 million - up 141 per cent.

 Continued growth at these levels will mean more congested cities, an even greater strain on  resources, a marginalised environment, over-burdened services and unaffordable costs of living.  This is the price of getting population policy wrong.  

 Now, on the eve of an election, Labor politicians have suddenly started to say they no longer  believe in a ‘Big Australia’.

 While Labor may have changed its rhetoric with its Leader, Labor’s policies on immigration and  population have not changed. Labor has also cynically attempted to put off any decisions on  these issues until after the election. 

 More recently, the Prime Minister even denied that achieving a sustainable population had  anything to do with immigration. For the Prime Minster to suggest that achieving a sustainable  population ‘isn’t about immigration’ is a denial of reality and responsibility.   

 Australians cannot afford to pay the price for a Prime Minister who is faking it on sustainable  population growth, any more than they can afford a government that pretends to be strong on  protecting our borders while supporting policies that encourage people-smuggling.

 Labor says they will solve the problem by boosting investment in infrastructure and services.  Many Australians have heard the same empty rhetoric before from state Labor governments,  particularly in NSW and Qld.

 Labor is seeking to make these investments with funds they do not have for projects they have  proved unable to deliver. As these promised projects fail to eventuate, Labor will continue to pile  on the pressure by refusing to rein in population growth. 

 Labor has also talked about the need to improve the spread of our population across the country.  

 T H E  C O A L I T I O N ’ S  P O L I C Y  F O R  P O P U L AT I O N  A N D  I M M I G R AT I O N              7

 While this is a worthy objective, it is not a substitute for dealing with the level of immigration  intake. Efforts to disperse our population over more than six decades have had only modest  success. Even where dispersal strategies are successful, they need to be supported by clear  overall population and immigration policies.

 Research by the Parliamentary Library shows that, at its peak, the percentage of our overseas-born population located outside major urban areas was 38 per cent.  The percentage in rural  areas was less than 25 per cent. This dispersal occurred more than 60 years ago in 1947. 

 The 2001 Census data shows that the proportion of our overseas-born population living outside  major urban areas fell to 18 per cent. More significantly, for those who had arrived since 1996, the  proportion was just 11 per cent. 

 Immigrants will continue to settle predominantly in our major urban areas. To rely on dispersal  initiatives to justify historically high levels of immigration runs the certain risk of piling even more  people into our cites. This will place the quality of life of those already affected, our environment,  our services and our infrastructure under even greater stress.  

 The rate of population growth currently being pursued by Labor, combined with Labor’s  comprehensive failure to manage our immigration programmes - and the failure of State Labor  governments to provide infrastructure and services, has led to a crisis of confidence amongst the  Australian people in our current population growth path. 

 Labor has no plan that admits the failures and properly addresses the issues.  In contrast, the  Coalition has a plan for real action to restore public confidence and consensus on the issue of  population growth and Australia’s immigration programme.

 T H E  C O A L I T I O N ’ S  P O L I C Y  F O R  P O P U L AT I O N  A N D  I M M I G R AT I O N              8

 THE COALITION’S PLAN FOR REAL ACTION ON  SUSTAINABLE POPULATION GROWTH Australians want their government to take control of population and immigration policies to  restore confidence and to ensure our immigration and population levels are sustainable and in  the national interest. 

 The Coalition has already laid out clear and unequivocal policies to regain control of our borders  and stop the unprecedented flow of illegal boat arrivals. These measures will restore the integrity  and fairness of our refugee and humanitarian programme and give Australians the confidence  that only those invited to come to our country will enjoy the safe haven of our nation.

 The Coalition will apply this same resolve to the broader population challenges we face - and  restore the confidence of Australians in our immigration programme.

 Australia’s immigration programme has not only been a primary driver of our economic growth  and prosperity, but is also a source of great pride for all Australians.   

 The Coalition’s Plan for Real Action on Sustainable Population Growth will restore confidence  and re-establish the consensus on the benefits of our immigration programme.  

 The Coalition will:

 1.	 Establish ‘Guard Rails’ for Population Growth

 In April 2010, the Coalition announced that we will set clear parameters for population  growth by tasking a renamed Productivity and Sustainability Commission to advise on  population growth bands that it considers are sustainable, which will in turn provide the  framework for setting migration programmes. 

 The Coalition’s policy will be informed by independent advice from the Productivity and  Sustainability Commission on what is a sustainable rate of population growth. 

 The growth bands, to be adopted by the Government, would be expressed in terms of an  annual rate of growth deemed by the Commission to be sustainable. This assessment  would be based on an ongoing review of Australia’s capacity to accommodate growth  through the delivery of improved infrastructure and services, the management of our  environment and resources, and the needs of our economy. 

 Australia’s immigration programme will be framed to ensure it keeps our population  growth rate within the growth bands.

 2.	 Take Real Action on Immigration

 The Coalition recognises that Australians are looking for immediate and direct action to  get our population growth under control. 

 T H E  C O A L I T I O N ’ S  P O L I C Y  F O R  P O P U L AT I O N  A N D  I M M I G R AT I O N              9

 A Coalition government will start the job by committing to reduce Australia’s annual rate  of population growth from more than 2 per cent under Labor, to our historical long-run  average of 1.4 per cent within our first term.

 The Coalition estimates that this will require a reduction in our annual rate of net overseas  migration from 298,924 in 2008/09 to no more than 170,000 per year by the end of our first  term. 

 In April the Coalition stated that ‘until such time as a growth band can be established...the  Coalition does not endorse the growth path…for a population of 36 million by 2050’. 

 Consistent with this position, the Coalition’s commitment will place Australia on a longer  term population growth path below that set out in the most recent IGR - which was on  target to deliver a population of 36 million.

 3.	 Make a Clear Commitment to Skills Migration and Regional Australia. 

 In April the Coalition acknowledged that the primary purpose of our immigration  programme is economic. We committed to ensuring that two-thirds of our permanent  migration programme would be for the purposes of skilled migration. 

 A Coalition Government will also quarantine the level of employer nominated skills  migration and 457 temporary business visas to at least the levels it inherits. In addition,  the Coalition will also seek to liberalise arrangements for temporary business visas (457s)  subject to clear standards, to make them more accessible to business, especially small  businesses, and business in regional areas, with proven skills shortage needs.

 The Coalition will also give priority to addressing the skills needs of regional areas and  small business, including encouraging the settlement on either a temporary or permanent  basis of new arrivals in regional and rural areas. States such as Queensland and Western  Australia will be afforded a high priority for permanent and temporary skilled visa  applications.  

 A Coalition Government will also seek to resettle more entrants from our refugee and  humanitarian programme in regional areas, where these resettlement programmes have  proved to be highly successful. 

 4.	 Establish A Clear and Consultative Process to Restore Control

 The Coalition will commit to the production of a White Paper on immigration that will  reframe the structure and composition of Australia’s immigration programme to address  the policy challenges of sustainable population growth.

 This process will work in parallel with the work undertaken by the Productivity and  Sustainability Commission - and will adopt as its starting point the task of achieving the  Coalition’s first term population growth target of 1.4 per cent, taking into account advice  on the current pipeline of applications.

 The White Paper process will also implement the Coalition’s commitment to ensure two-thirds of the permanent migration programme will be for skilled migration, together with  the changes to the operation of the refugee and humanitarian programme, already outlined 

 T H E  C O A L I T I O N ’ S  P O L I C Y  F O R  P O P U L AT I O N  A N D  I M M I G R AT I O N              10

 by the Coalition in this area.   

 In particular, the White Paper process will: 

 â¢	 Examine the potential to move Australia’s immigration programme to a more supply-dominated model that is driven not by demand for visas but by determinations on  how many should be offered;

 â¢	 Review the integrity of processing arrangements both offshore and onshore in all  visa categories;

 â¢	 Identify gaps in legislation which have the potential to blow out numbers in the  future;

 â¢	 Address rorts and abuses across all areas and tighten programme criteria to ensure  that those who come to Australia are best placed to make a contribution to this  country in the way that migrants have done in the past; and 

 â¢	 Review the visa capping provisions introduced in the last session of Parliament.

 It is anticipated that a Discussion Paper will be released by the end of 2010, with a final  paper to be completed by the Coalition’s first Budget in May 2011. This will help inform the  composition of the 2011-12 migration programme. 

 The White Paper will be the subject of a genuine consultation process, with the stated  objective of determining how we meet our commitment to reduce the rate of population  growth to 1.4 per cent in our first term.

 COSTINGS The Coalition will commit an additional $16 million over the forward estimates to the proposed  Productivity and Sustainability Commission so that it has the resources needed to undertake  the work required.

 This funding will be provided from the nearly $24 billion in recurrent savings that have been  identified by the Coalition over the forward estimates. 

 These savings are a result of cutting Labor’s waste and mismanagement and redirecting  funding from inefficient and poorly performing Labor Government programmes.
