 Australian Greens  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young   

 Statement on Christmas Island boat tragedy   

 “Our hearts go out to all those involved in yesterday's tragedy, including the families who have lost loved  ones,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “I want to thank the brave men and women who undertake these search and rescue operations in our  Australian waters.     

 “These terrible events show that we need to create safer pathways to protection for refugees in our  region, and we need to do it now.   

 “It is heart breaking that we have had another tragedy so soon after the death of a group of people,  including a baby boy, on the weekend.   

 “What we need to acknowledge is that cruel deterrence policies don’t work and they aren’t saving lives at  sea.   

 “The Houston Panel recommended that Australia take 3,800 refugees out of Indonesia and resettle them  here in Australia to take the pressure off desperate refugees being forced onto dangerous boats.     

 “An emergency intake from Indonesia would be a first step to creating a genuine regional solution and  would give refugees a much safer way to come to Australia.”
