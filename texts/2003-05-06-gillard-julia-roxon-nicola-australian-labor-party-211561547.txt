 MR RUDDOCK - IT'S TIME TO PROTECT THE  CHILDREN, NOT DR HOLLINGWORTH   

 

 Philip Ruddock has shown again today that he does not understand the importance  of protecting children from harmful experiences and abuse.   

 Mr Ruddock has argued that "forgiveness" is a justification to support Dr  Hollingworth's actions in covering up child sex abuse.   

 While forgiveness has an important place, it is not above the law.    

 The Church's own Inquiry found that Dr Hollingworth's actions in covering up  child sex abuse were "untenable" and that he failed to show compassion.   

 Mr Ruddock has already demonstrated his own lack of compassion in regard to  the children he has kept in detention, many of whom face the risk of abuse.     

 He says he understands forgiveness - is he now expecting children in detention to  forgive him?   

 Mr Ruddock is inappropriately defending the actions of a person who protected a  paedophile.   

 Mr Ruddock should think more about protecting children and stop protecting Dr  Hollingworth.    

 The Howard Government continues to forget that it is the children who need  protection - not Dr Hollingworth.
