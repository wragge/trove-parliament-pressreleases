  AUSTRALIA’ S

  RESETTLEMENT STRATEGIES:

  

  VULNERABLE GROUPS NEED

  EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES

  

  

  Speech presented at the

  Regional Tripartite Consultations on Resettlement

  in Canberra on Thursday 21 May 1998

  

  by the Hon Philip Ruddock MP

  Minister for Immigration and   Multicultural Affairs

  

  

  Welcoming words

  

 It is a pleasure to join these Consultations again, 
and to look around and see a number of familiar faces.

  

 I would like to say how much we appreciate the initiative 
shown by UNHCR in arranging these Consultations. This is now the third 
round of the Regional Tripartite Consultations.

  

 I can say from the Australian side, we find these 
talks a most productive means of monitoring and improving the effectiveness 
of our resettlement action. We greatly value the exchange of information 
and feedback that comes from practical working consultations like this.

  

 So, I extend my personal thanks to UNHCR’s Regional 
Representative,   Mr Jahanshah Assadi , for his role in convening these Consultations.

  

 I would also like to welcome everyone from across 
the Tasman: the New Zealand government delegation, headed by   Mrs Marie Sullivan , and representatives from four New Zealand 
NGOs.

  

 The Australian participants include officials from 
my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and representatives 
of no fewer than eight Australian NGOs. That demonstrates the range 
of interested players on refugee resettlement issues.

  

  

 We also have here as a participant   Mr Olesen  (  pron. OL-le-sen ) who is the Regional Representative of the 
International Organization for Migration.

  

 And we have several diplomats as observers, including 
representatives of Canada, Papua New Guinea and the United States.

  

 Welcome to you all.

  

  Our shared concerns

  

 Australia and New Zealand share a strong concern for 
doing what we can to assist some of the world’s most needy refugees, 
by offering permanent resettlement. We are among a comparatively small 
group of countries that offer permanent resettlement for humanitarian 
reasons - so it is very important that we make resettlement work, 
and work well.

  

 As is well known, per capita, Australia maintains 
one of the largest refugee resettlement programs in the world. Since 
the second World War, over half a million refugees and displaced people 
have been resettled here, and this year we will resettle 12,000 people 
in Australia.

  

 Within our program we have recognised the need for 
resettlement of vulnerable groups, particularly women. Australia is 
one of the very few countries which has a specific resettlement program 
for Women at Risk. Our planning level for Women at Risk visas this year 
was 420. We have already exceeded this.

  

  While our response to humanitarian need has been and will continue 
to be a generous one, Australia’s resources are not unlimited. It 
is in this contex t that we have focussed on the need to choose 
well:

  

  * ensuring that 
resettlement places go to those in greatest relative need;

  

  * working hard 
to eliminate abuse of the system and;

  

  * supporting refugee 
and Special Humanitarian Program entrants to settle  quickly and 
well into the Australian community.

  

  I am pleased to see that the themes for today’s two workshops reflect 
these areas of shared concern, dealing as they do with the resettlement 
of vulnerable groups and with strategies for Government/NGO/UNHCR  
cooperation on resettlement.

  

 I see these two themes as   inter-related . They both address the issue of   effectiveness :

  

  * in finding better 
ways and methods to identify those most in need of resettlement; and

  

  * forging new partnerships 
between the governme nt sector, NGOs and UNHCR to maximise our 
respective contributions towards resettlement objectives and the settlement 
services we offer refugees after arrival.

  

  I look forward to hearing about the outcomes of your deliberations.

  

  Since the last Regional Tr ipartite Consultations, the Government 
has continued to focus its limited resources on those in greatest relative 
need. We have kept public support, by maintaining the integrity of the 
programs, targeting the most deserving, and minimising opportunities 
for abuse.

  

  Onshore Program

  

 The measures taken to reform the onshore refugee determination 
process over the last year included allowing work rights only to asylum 
seeker-applicants who have been in Australia for less than 45 days in 
the past 12 months prior to applying for a protection visa.

  

  - This ensures 
that genuine asylum seekers who come to Australia for the very purpose 
of seeking protection continue to have access to work rights.

  

  You will be aware that I also introduced a $1000 post-decision fee 
for RRT appl icants determined not to be refugees.

  

  - This measure 
is designed solely to discourage review applications from those who 
are only seeking to prolong their stay in Australia.

  

  In addition, a range of procedural changes have been introduced which 
have strea mlined protection visa processing at the primary stage. 
As a result of these changes, asylum seekers are getting quicker decisions 
and those who seek to abuse the system are being denied the benefit 
of processing delays.

  

 These measures have had an effect.

  

  * Once the changes 
were introduced, the application rate began to decline with the monthly 
average now steady at 665, compared with a previous monthly average 
of 800 to 900.

  

  * Applications 
from countries from which one would not expect many refugees, su ch 
as the Philippines, have fallen markedly.

  

  * Backlogs of applications, 
other than applications from East Timorese, will have been cleared by 
the end of this financial year.

  

  While there is understandably concern about people abusing the protection 
visa  process, there is also concern for the welfare of asylum 
seekers.

  

 To this end my Department has recently negotiated 
with the Red Cross for the continued delivery of the Asylum Seeker’s 
Assistance Scheme (ASAS). The scheme is funded by the Government and 
administered by the Red Cross and provides income support and limited 
health care to asylum seekers in genuine hardship.

  

  Offshore Program

  

 We place great importance on ensuring that we meet 
our international obligations to offer protection to those bona fide 
asylum seekers already in Australia.

  

 However, we have also always believed that a very 
significant part of our humanitarian response must be made through our 
offshore resettlement program.

  

 This is where we stretch our limited resources further 
- by assisting people for whom resettlement is the only viable solution. 
The Government has been aiming to achieve a proper balance between fully 
meeting our onshore obligations and continuing to offer offshore assistance.

  

 In April this year, I was very pleased to be able 
to announce a   transfer of 500 places  from the onshore to the offshore element 
of the Humanitarian Program.

  

 As the number of places required to meet our obligations 
to people seeking protection in Australia has been smaller this year 
than we had anticipated, we have been able to use the surplus places 
to expand opportunities for humanitarian resettlement from overseas.

  

 Since coming to office, the Government has maintained 
its humanitarian program at 12,000, but in the offshore component of 
the Program we have placed greater emphasis on refugees and people who 
face serious discrimination amounting to gross violation of their human 
rights.

  

  - This has been 
achieved by reducing the Special Assistance Category in favour of the 
Refugee and the Special  Humanitarian Programs.

  

  Another significant development since the last Consultations is the 
introduction of humanitarian family reunion provisions.

  

  The Government is aware that humanitarian entrants and Protection 
Visa holders, can be concerned about the  safety and wellbeing 
of close family members from whom they have been unavoidably separated.

  

 This can cause settlement difficulties, particularly 
for those who may have suffered torture or other trauma prior to settlement.

  

 Under the   split family arrangements , holders of humanitarian visas granted 
overseas or Protection Visas granted within Australia, are able to support 
the applications of immediate family members to enter Australia under 
the Humanitarian Program.

  

 There is no fee for such an application and family 
members are eligible for the same humanitarian settlement services as 
the original humanitarian entrant.

  

  The 1998/99 Humanitarian Program

  

 As I mentioned earlier, there are   limits  to the numbers of people Australia can resettle.

  

 In establishing the level for the annual intake, the 
Government has to take into account Australia’s capacity to support 
new arrivals, as well as community views and UNHCR’s assessment of 
global resettlement needs. This is where partnerships are important.

  

 To meet our commitments, particularly in the Refugee 
component of the offshore program, we will continue to work cooperatively 
with UNHCR.

  

 We would also like to engage in closer partnership 
with other organizations involved with refugees and displaced persons 
in the field, in order to look at options for improving our processing 
of humanitarian applications.

  

 I believe that such   cooperative  approaches can assist in the identification and 
referral of those   most in need  of resettlement.

  

  Post Arrival Settlement Assistance

  

 We recognise that our responsibility to refugees is 
not limited to simply offering the opportunity to resettle in Australia.

  

 All refugees, particularly non-English speaking refugees, 
are vulnerable in their first months of settlement.

  

  - Particularly 
vulnerable are those who have suffered torture and trauma.

  

  Early intervention and individualised case management, d esigned 
to ensure that specific needs can be quickly and effectively addressed, 
is the sort of partnership with the NGO sector which we wish to promote.

  

  Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy

  

 In this context, the Government has recognised that 
much more can be done to assist humanitarian entrants settle quickly 
and effectively into life in Australia.

  

 In addition to the funds we already provide for the 
delivery of humanitarian settlement services such as On-Arrival Accommodation 
and the Community Refugee Support Scheme, new funding of $20.8 million 
over four years has been directed towards development of a more effective 
and co-ordinated framework of settlement services for humanitarian entrants.

  

 The new national framework, the   Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy , is providing more 
holistic settlement services, better targeted to those most in need 
of assistance.

  

 It provides:

  

 - an integrated case management approach

  

 - co-ordination between service providers;

  

 - training for volunteers;

  

 - an information strategy for proposers; and

  

 - an increase in material assistance.

  

 In the first year of the Strategy, funding was directed 
towards

  

  * the establishment 
of a network of community based organisations, to provide case management 
services to Ref ugees and Humanitarian Program entrants, and

  

  * to facilitate 
coordination of the range of settlement-related service providers in 
a particular locality.

  

  

  Underpinning the network of case management services is a   early health 
intervention program , provided by a National Forum of non-governmental 
agencies for recently arrived Refugees and Humanitarian entrants, in 
particular for survivors of torture and trauma.

  

 The program identifies needs through the provision 
of assessment, counselling and casework services, and identifies appropriate 
health services for referral.

  

 The early intervention approach we are developing 
should ensure that RSHP entrants can fully and effectively access broad 
based community services (such as health, employment, education etc) 
as well as our general settlement services, in particular, English language 
training.

  

  Adult Migrant English Program

  

 In this context, and again recognising the specific 
needs and vulnerabilities of RSHP entrants, we have provided additional 
funding of $17.7 million over four years to AMEP.

  

 Most of the additional funding will be spent on preparatory 
programs for refugee and humanitarian entrants who are assessed to be 
in need of special learning assistance, mainly due to the effects of 
torture and trauma.

  

  O  ther Key Issues

  

  Other regional consultations - Asia-Pacific 
Consultations

  

 Of course we should not overlook the fact that we 
also operate in a regional context.

  

 I am pleased that UNHCR, working with Australia and 
other countries in the region, has taken a prominent role in nurturing 
the development of the Asia-Pacific Consultations on Refugees and Displaced 
Persons.

  

  - The Consultations 
had their starting point at the Canberra Conference in November 1996 
and

  

  - were followed 
by the Bangkok meeting in July 1997.

  

  It is indeed timely, given current events in the region, that the 
APC is again meeting under UNHCR and IOM  auspices in Bangkok 
next month and will discuss the impact of current crisis for regional 
flows.

  

 Australia continues to strongly support the relationship 
and confidence building that the APC process is about.

  

  Closing remarks

  

 Finally, I would like to say that, from our perspective, 
the success of this round of Consultations is in your collective hands. 
I understand that a new format for the Consultations is being trialed 
today - with two working groups, each with an experienced facilitator.

  

 We are looking for some concrete work, and recommendations 
on how to make resettlement more effective.

  

 I encourage you to bring all your skills and experience 
to the table, so that we can make some further progress in this important 
task.
