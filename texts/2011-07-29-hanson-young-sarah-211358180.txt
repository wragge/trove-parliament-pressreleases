 Greens to refer Malaysian agreement to Senate inquiry 

 The Australian Greens will refer the people swap agreement with Malaysia to a Senate  inquiry to give the parliament and the public an opportunity to scrutinise this unfair deal. 

 “The Australian government has ignored the historic condemnation of this agreement by both  houses of parliament and is intent on carrying out the forcible expulsion of 800 vulnerable  people,” Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, said. 

 “The Immigration Minister has rejected the will of the parliament with this agreement, which  is not legally binding on either Australia or Malaysia and exports Australia’s international  obligations to people seeking asylum. 

 “There are numerous unanswered questions about this deal which the government refuses to  answer, such as what will happen to unaccompanied children, so a Senate inquiry is vital in  getting answers.” 

 The Greens will be moving to establish the inquiry when parliament resumes in mid-August. 

 “It is telling that there are no voices among human rights groups and lawyers and other legal  experts in Australia and Malaysia who back this expensive and unnecessary agreement,” Sen.  Hanson-Young added. 

 An inquiry will also give everyday Australians, many of whom have contacted Greens offices  nationwide in outrage at the deal, the chance to formally give their thoughts to the Gillard  government. 

 The draft terms of reference would include: 

 The consistency of the agreement to transfer asylum seekers to Malaysia with Australia's  international obligations and Australian human rights standards;  

 The costs associated with the agreement and potential liability of parties with respect to  breaches of terms or future litigation; 

 Details on possible exemption arrangements, especially for unaccompanied minors and  pregnant women.
