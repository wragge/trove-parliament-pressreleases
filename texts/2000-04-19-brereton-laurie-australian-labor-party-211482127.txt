  FOREIGN AFFAIRS BUDGET LEAK: FOREIGN AID FALLS TO RECORD LOW 

  “A leaked draft ‘Government Members Budget Briefing Kit’ confirms that Australia’s foreign aid   will fall to a new low as a proportion of Gross National Product in next month’s Federal Budget”,   the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laurie Brereton, said today. 

  “According to a briefing paper prepared for Coalition Members of Parliament, the Australian   Government will provide $1.6 billion in overseas development assistance in the 2000-2001   budget. Although the briefing paper notes this is an increase on last year’s budget figure, it is in   fact significantly less than the final foreign aid expenditure for 1999-2000 of $1.65 billion.” 

  “As a consequence of this reduction Australia’s foreign aid as a proportion of GNP is projected to   fall from the 0.28 percent level achieved in 1999-2000 to 0.25 percent in 2000-2001 -- the lowest   level in thirty years.” 

  “This year’s budget commitment on overseas aid falls well short of the effort urged by the   Australian Council for Overseas Aid which in its pre-budget submission recommended that the   Government consolidate the volume of overseas development assistance at last year’s 0.28   percent of GNP.” 

  “The leaked briefing paper places considerable emphasis on providing $150 million of assistance   over four years to East Timor. It should be noted, however, that only $40 million will be   provided to East Timor in 2000-2001. This level of assistance is claimed to be consistent with   East Timor’s absorptive capacity and needs, but it again falls short of ACFOA’s recommendation   that approximately $50 million be allocated for emergency assistance, reconstruction and civil 

  administration in East Timor in 2000-200 1.” 

  “The Government’s briefing paper claims no country programs have been cut to fund assistance   to East Timor, however it makes no reference to possible impacts on global programs including   emergency and humanitarian relief and contributions to international development organisations.   Nor has the Government acted on calls by ACFOA for increases in aid to Africa and South Asia,   the regions where the largest numbers of the world’s poorest people live.” 

  “The leaked briefing paper reveals another miserly performance from a Government which   slashed Australia’s overseas development assistance in its first two budgets and now appears   content to allow our foreign aid to slide a further historic low.” 

  A copy of the leaked ‘Government Members Budget Briefing Kit’ is attached together with a   summary of Australia’s foreign aid performance.

  GOVERNMENT MEMBERS BUDGET BRIEFING KIT 

  POSSIBLE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

  EAST TIMOR 

  How much is Australia giving to East Timor? How does this compare with other   donors? 

  l The Government will provide $150 million in aid to East Timor over four   years, $100 million of which is additional funding. 

  l On the basis of other donors’ pledge positions at the Tokyo donors’ meeting, we   are one of the main donors, others being Portugal, Japan and the EC. 

  Why are we giving aid to East Timor when there are problems at home? 

  * There is overwhelming community support for Australia’s assistance to East   Timor 

  l The needs in East Timor are immense: destruction of over 70% of its   infrastructure and displacement of three quarters of its population 

  l Austra!ia’s aid to East Timor: 

  - will help establish a stable and increasingly self-reliant East Timor in our   national interest 

  - will protect the enormous investment Australia has already made in East   Timor 

  l Australian business will also benefit from aid-related activity in East Timor 

  Why is Australia giving so much to East Timor, when the international community   has pledged so much aid to East Timor ($319 million USD, most pledges over a 3   year period and excluding humanitarian assistance)? 

  l The United Nations and World Bank have indicated that development spending   over three years has been carefully judged to match an attainable absorptive   capacity and needs in East Timor 

  l Pledges are not always followed through quickly or in full. There is also a   tendency for donors whose immediate interests are not affected to disengage over   time. 

  l The Government has made a commitment to provide substantial assistance to   East Timor and is responding to community expectations that Australia’s   assistance to East Timor will be generous. 

  Why isn ‘t Australia giving more to East Timor (at least $75 million was provided in 

  1999-2000 and you ‘re on fy providing $40 million in 2000-01)? 

  l Additional funding was provided in 1999-2000 to respond to the need for   emergency relief and immediate needs. 

  l With security now established and the need for emergency relief abating, East   Timor is entering a phase of reconstruction and rebuilding of a viable,   independent nation. 

  l This level of funding is consistent with East Timor’s absorptive capacity and   needs, and Australia’s capacity to assist. 

  W?zat will the money for East Timor be spent on? 

  Australian aid assistance to East Timor will focus on helping to: 

  - restore basic services and improve service delivery (eg in health, education   and water supply/sanitation) 

  - develop an efficient and sustainable government and administrative structure 

  - strengthen productive sectors of the economy, especially agriculture 

  - promote reconciliation 

  - support multilateral reconstruction and development efforts. 

  The program will emphasise capacity building to enable the East Timorese to   enhance their capacity for self-government and take responsibility for their future   development. 

  Humanitarian relief to assist the resettlement and rehabilitation of East Timorese   communities will also be provided. 

  Have you cut aid to other programs, in particular Indonesia, to fund East Timor? 

  l Australia’s commitment to assist East Timor does not diminish our commitment   to assist our other aid partners. 

  - No country programs have been cut to fund increased assistance to East   Timor. 

  - We remain committed to our development cooperation programs in PNG,   Indonesia, East Asia, South Asia and Africa 

  - Expected total flows to Indonesia are around $120 million   in 2000-01 

  (about the same as 1999-2000). 

  BOOSTING CONSULAR SERVICES 

  Why is the Government be spending more on consular services? 

  l Australians expect access to a comprehensive and high quality consular service. 

  l Past increases in demand for consular services have been met within existing   resources. The additional funding is being provided to ensure that the level of   consular services provided to Australians is maintained in the face of a significant   future increase in demand identified in the pricing review of consular services. 

  l The increase in consular services is budget-neutral as fees for consular services   will be increased by an amount which covers the additional costs. 

  Do consularfees need to be raised? 

  l The increase in fees will cover the cost of meeting an identified increase in   demand for consular services. 

  l Even after this increase, consular fees will be the lowest by far of any comparable   Western country, and lower than similar services at state government level and in   the private sector. 

  l Past increases in demand for consular services have been accommodated without   additional funding through the introduction of a range of measures to contain costs   in real terms while ensuring that consular services continue to be delivered at a   high standard. There is a limit to how ;r,uch can be absorbed without additional   resources. 

  Do passport fees cover the cost of passport and consular services, and if so why is   there an increase in consular fees? 

  l Passport fees are set at a level which is intended to cover the cost of passport and   consular services, but the level of fees collected each year varies according to   demand. As an example, in the current financial year, due in large part to   developments in Indonesia and travelling public reaction to the Year 2000 issue,   passport issues have been close to IO per cent below projection. This translates 

  into a decrease in revenue of between !S 10 - $15 million. 

  l The increase in consular fees is modest and will allow for investment in new   technology to meet the expected increase in demand created by an additional   750,000 travellers over the next three years.   l 

  Even after this increase, consular fees will be the lowest by far of any comparable 

  Western country, and lower than similar services at state government level and in   the private sector. 

  How much of the increase in consularfees is due to the GST? 

  l The provision of consular services is exempt from the GST, and the increase in   consular fees contains no GST component. 

  AID BUDGET - VOLUME OF AID 

  How much is Australia giving as aid in 2000-Ol? How does this compare with what   we have given previously and with what other donors are providing? 

  l In 2000-01 the Australian Government will provide $1,600 million in official   development assistance (ODA). 

  - Nearly $100 million increase on 1999-2000 aid budget figure of $1,502   million. 

  - This represents a four per cent increase above same real for the aid budget. 

  - Australia also responded strongly to additional demands at they arose during   the course of 1999-2000. This included providing an additional $60 million   for East Timor, $12 million for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative,   and $48 million for expenditure on Kosovar and East Timorese evacuees in   Australia. The final ODA outcome for that year was $1,65 1 million. 

  l Australia’s ODA/ GNP ratio in 2000-01 will be 0.25 per cent, compared with   the most recent average of donors (0.24 per cent in 1998). 

  AID BUDGET - CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME 

  Why are we giving aid overseas when there are problems at home?   0 Overseas aid is an important expression of Australia’s commitment to the world’s   poor and building a better future for all. 

  - In the developing world some 1.3 billion survive on less than a dollar a day;   over a billion people lack access to safe water; and some 820 million people   go hungry or face food insecurity. 

  - We are among the world’s wealthier countries and cannot shirk our 

  humanitarian responsibilities. In dollar terms, our aid program costs each   Australian approximately the cost of a loaf of bread a week 

  l Australians independently demonstrate their concern for those less fortunate in   other countries 

  - The response to appeals to assist the East Timorese last year and the Kosovo   refugees is testament to the level of Australian compassion. 

  l Aid is also in our national interest. 

  - It promotes economic growth and security, particularly in our region 

  “.^ . ---- 

  : Rising incomes in our trading partners creates expanded trade and 

  investment opportunities for Australia - restoring growth in East Asia is an   important goal of our aid program   : Promoting development enhances stability in the region.   : Our aid program also utilises Australian goods and services as much as 

  possible. 

  - Aid also plays an important role   in addressing non-military threats to Australia 

  such as pandemics, illegal migration, refugee flows, global environment   problems, narcotics and transnational crime. 

  What do we do with our aid? 

  Who do we eive aid to? 

  l Australia’s aid program is concentrated on the region with the greatest number of   poor people and of highest foreign and trade priority for Australia - the Asia   Pacific. 

  l The largest recipient of Australian aid is Papua New Guinea. Other major   partners include Indonesia, East Timor, Vietnam, the Philippines, China, Laos,   Cambodia and Fiji (for a full list of recipients of Australian aid please refer to the   aid budget summary.) 

  l Aid is not given to governments - it is used in programs and projects aimed at   reducing poverty and achieving sustainable development. 

  l Australia also provides assistance selectively to countries in Africa, Middle East   and South Asia, in recognition of the development needs in these regions. 

  Activities we fund 

  l Aid program focuses on the key sectors of health, education, infrastructure,   agriculture and rural development, and governance. 

  l Examples of the sorts of projects funded through the Australian Government’s aid   program include: 

  - Improving health care for women and children in Indonesia; 

  - Training teachers in PNG; 

  - Providing families with access to safe water supplies in Samoa; 

  - Demining activities in Cambodia; 

  l The aid program supports multilateral programs such as those administered by the   World Bank, Asian Development Bank, United Nations and other multilateral   agencies 

  - Agencies include UNlCEF (United Nations Fund for Children), UNHCR   (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) and ICRC (the   International Committee of the Red   Cross). 

  l Australian non-government organisations (NGOs) receive support from the 

  Government for community based development activities overseas. 

  l Australia provides emergency and humanitarian assistance for victims of disasters.   For example flood assistance in Vietnam and Mozambique. 

  AID BUDGET - SOCIAL SERVICES 

  In line with the poverty reduction focus, have you increasedfunding to the basic   social services of health, education, water and sanitation by 20per cent overall? 

  Australian Government does not set the aid budget in terms of reaching minimum   allocations on a sectoral basis, but recognises the importance of social   development. 

  Spending on ‘Social Infrastructure and Services’ under the aid program has   increased by 15 per cent over the last decade and is now almost 40 per cent of   total expenditure. 

  Using World Summit Social Development 20/20 definition of social services   (which is much narrower than Australia’s definition), 12 per cent of our budget   goes to basic social services; 19 per cent with the inclusion of food aid. This   exceeds the DAC average of 10 per cent. 

  What impact will the GST have c.rt oversex aid activities by non-government   organisations? 

  l GST will not impact on the volume of funding to NGOs. 

  l Donations to NGOs’ tax-deductible funds will continue to be claimable as   deductions for income tax purposes. 

  l As the Government’s purchaser of services from registered Australian aid NGOs,   AusAID will be liable to pay GST. 

  - However, registered Government organisations can claim an input tax credit   for GST paid on goods and services. In this way purchases for the aid   program will effectively be GST-free. 

  - Grants to charitable institutions will be ‘grossed up’ by 10 per cent.   Charitable institutions will actually benefit from some cost savings because   the grants will be the same (after GST) but costs to charitable institutions will   be lower as a result of the tax reform package. 

  : Where they provide similar goods and services on a commercial basis,   businesses and charitable organisations will be treated equally. 

  --- -- 

  AID BUDGET - SOUTH ASIA AND AFRICA 

  Why aren ‘t we increasing assistance to Africa and South Asia   0 Recognise that South Asia and Africa are poor regions with significant   developmental needs 

  - Consistent with the directions and principles set out in the Government’s   1997 policy statement Better Aidfor a Better Future, Australia’s aid program   is heavily concentrated in PNG, East Asia and the South Pacific, where there   are significant development needs 

  - Total Australian aid flows durin, 0 2000-01 to South Asia are estimated at   $9 1.3m and to Africa and the Middle East is $82.0 million. 

  AID BUDGET - JUBILEE 2000 

  Does the Government support the cancellation of debt owed by developing countries   as calledfor by the Jubilee 2000 Coalition? 

  l The Government is committed to addressing unmanageable debt in very poor   countries but does not support unconditional debt cancellation. 

  l Australia supports the World Banlc/IMF Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)   Initiative which aims to lower the debts of the world’s poorest countries subject to   satisfactory economic and social policies. 

  l In September 1999, the HIPC Initiative was enhanced to provide faster, deeper   and wider debt relief, and to boost the links to poverty reduction. 

  l Australia has pledged AUD55 million (in nominal terms) to HIPC. 

  Does Australia support bilateral debt forgiveness? 

  l Australia prefers to work within existing multilateral frameworks, which   tackle debt comprehensively, and provide relief fairly and transparently. Australia   has only a small proportion of bilateral debt owing by poor countries. 

  l Of the debt owed to Australia, the majority of loans are performing well and   providing economic benefits to recipient countries. 

  l The Government manages bilateral debt through the Paris Club - a group of   creditor countries and a participant in the HIPC Initiative. 

  l Through the Paris Club, Australia can provide bilateral debt rescheduling and   relief to HIPC-eligible countries over and above that pledged multilaterally (eg, to   Nicaragua in 1998). 

  Why isn ‘t Australia providing debt relief for Mozambique? 

  l Mozambique has no bilateral debts with Australia. 

  l As a HIPC participant, Mozambique is receiving significant debt reduction -   USD3.7 billion. 

  l Mozambique has qualified for more than USDSOO million in additional debt relief   under the enhanced HIPC initiative. Mozambique’s debts to multilateral creditors,   including the IMF, have been cut by two-thirds and will continue to fall. 

  l Mozambique has obtained additional debt relief via the Paris Club. 

  AID BUDGET - BURMA 

  Why is Australia giving aid to the Government of Burma for human rights? What is   the Government’s response to the suggestion that Australia is comparable to Burma   in its human rights record? 

  l The Government utterly rejects any comparison between Australia and Burma   regarding human rights policies. 

  l We have consistently advocated the need for the Burmese regime to make   substantive progress on human rights. We are not resiling from that stand. 

  l We continue to support the UN’s efforts to influence change in Burma 

  - our human rights initiative is intended to complement UN processes. 

  - work towards an national human rights institution. 

  l The Burmese Government has responded positively to our efforts to engage on   this initiative. 

  l The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Mr Downer MP has agreed to initial   activities of an introductory course on human rights and an overview of   international law for middle ranking Burmese civil servants. 

  - all training provided under this initiative will be subject to continuing   constructive engagement by the Burmese side. 

  Will Australia provide training to the Burmese armed forces? 

  l No. Courses will be dehvered to middle ranking civil servants from key   Ministries such as Foreign Affairs, Home Affairs and Attorney-General’s.

  NINTH ANNUAL STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT ON 

  AUSTRALIA’S DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION   PROGRAM 

  Ministerial Statement by The Hon Alexander   Downer MP, Minister for Foreign Affairs, 9 

  December 1999 

  I 

  am pleased to make the Ninth annual statement to parliament on   Australia’s development cooperation program. 

  This last year has been one of major challenges and change,   particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Australia has been at the   forefront of responding to those challenges. We have promoted our   national interests, in a way which has strengthened our standing in   the region and the world. 

  It has also been a year of great 

  achievements, with the aid program playing a practical and positive   role in Australia’s contribution to the stability and development of   our region. 

  Australian support, including through the aid program, has helped   our neighbours emerge from the economic crisis and set out on the   path to recovery and sustainable growth. 

  We have helped   Indonesia begin its transition to democracy, with   substantial assistance for that country’s first democratic elections   in four decades. 

  Australia has been instrumental in the East Timorese being able to   choose their own future--and is now playing a strong part in   helping them realise that future. 

  Papua New Guinea--our largest aid partner--has a new   government, which is committed to economic reform. Australia is   providing solid backing to its reform efforts. Our aid program in   Bougainville continues to underpin the peace process on the 

  province. 

  We have continued to help the island nations of the South Pacific   pursue their economic and social reform agendas. 

  Australia responded quickly and effectively to help the Solomon 

  Islands government deal with the impact of the   Guadalcanal/Malaita tensions, including through emergency   humanitarian and rehabilitation assistance.

  AusAlU: Yublications 

  The government has ensured that the aid program is well-placed to   play its part. We have provided additional funds to the program for   East Timor. In September, the Treasurer and I announced an   additional contribution of $35 million over three years to the   Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, HIPCI, to help lower the   debt burden of the world’s poorest nations. We have assisted East   Timorese and Kosovar evacuees in Australia. These commitment_s 

  will incEase official development assistance this financial yearJo   over $1.6 billion. ‘hus at this staae, our ODA/GNP ratio looks set to e . -   increase from the previously estimated 0.25 per cent to 0.28 per   cent. 

  These increases are substantial. But volume is not the only--or   even the most important--measure of the government’s   achievement in the development field. More important are the   quality and impact of development. This has been a long-standing   concern of mine. And the government has lifted aid quality, as   demonstrated by the recent review of Australia’s aid program by   the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD. This peer 

  review by other donor countries concluded with a press release on   7 December in these terms: 

  Australia’s development cooperation programme has gone through   an impressive process of restructuring and renewal since the last   peer review in May 

  1996. Continuing reforms and adaptations to   aid policies and management have improved the quality and impact   of the programme. A strengthened approach to programme   planning, implementation, and evaluation are an integral part of 

  (the) focus on quality. These reforms put Australia in the vanguard   of DAC members’ aid management practices. 

  This could not be a more positive report card on our aid program   from our peers.   It is really quite excellent. 

  Governance 

  The different challenges over the last year have had their own   individual natures and circumstances. But, in reviewing the year,   we see that a common thread is ‘governance’. 

  Governance covers many powerful concepts, including good   government, capacity building, transparency and accountability,   human rights and the equitable rule of law.   It is about what makes   a good society--where citizens and groups voice their interests, 

  mediate their differences and exercise their rights, both in the   private sector and in the public domain. 

  Societies in which decisions by government can be questioned and   contested are ones in which good decisions are more likely to be   made. The process through which governments are forced to   pause, consider alternatives and then defend their decisions 

  promotes better outcomes.
