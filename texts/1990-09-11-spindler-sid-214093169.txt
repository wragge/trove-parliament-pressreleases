 MEDIA RELEASE

 SENATOR SID SPINDLER  AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRAT  SENATOR FOR VICTORIA

 PARLIAMENT OF AUSTFRALIA ·  THE SENATE

 11 September 1990

 TT.T.EGAL ENTRANTS IN AUSTRALIA -  BALANCING CONTROL AMD COMPASSION

 "The neglect of previous Governments has left Australia with  a legacy of illegal entrants which is estimated at between 90,000  and 150,000, and this number must be reduced," Senator Sid  Spindler, Democrat Spokesperson on Immigration & Ethnic Affairs  and a member of the Migration Regulations Committee, said today.

 "The Australian Democrats support tough measures to  apprehend and deport illegal entrants.  This is necessary to  protect the integrity of our immigration programme: to the extent  that we allow queue jumpers to get away with breaking the law we  reduce our capacity to receive refugees and family reunion  migrants who are taking their turn in the approval process."

 "However, the Government's attempt last year to codify  Australia's immigration laws has produced a rigid and oppressive  body of legislation which makes it virtually impossible to take  account of individual circumstances where the strict application  of the law would produce unjustifiable hardship."

 "It is essential to provide a mechanism to allow our system  to take account of exceptional circumstances. Unless this is  done, our legal system will be brought into disrepute and people  who deserve compassionate consideration will be driven  underground."

 "After 31 October such exceptions should and will be at an  absolute minimum. Prior to 31 October, we must find means to  reduce the current undesirable level of illegals."

 "If the Committee's recommendations are accepted, this will  be achieved by a 'carrot and stick' approach:

 Illegal entrants leaving Australia voluntarily before 31  October will be able to re-apply from abroad without any time  restrictions.

 Illegal entrants apprehended after 31 October will suffer  time restrictions on their ability to apply and will have to meet  costs associated with being deported. Several thousand have  chosen to leave to avoid these disadvantages.

 "It is also necessary to enable people in 

 circumstances to at least have their case heard." exceptional C O M M O N W E A L TH

 "Î¤Î¿ this end the Committee recommends and the Australian  Democrats support empowering the Immigration Review Tribunal to  consider applications from people who believe they are innocent  illegals, i.e. people who have entered Australia and stayed here  not knowing that they are illegal, e.g. children who arrive here  with their parents unaware of their parents' circumstances."

 "Secondly, people who have been here more than five years  will be able to apply. However, these are threshold 

 requirements. Applicants will also have to satisfy public  interest criteria and will be required to demonstrate that they  have made a positive and substantial contribution to Australia  and that there are compelling compassionate circumstances which  contributed to the applicant's illegal standing and which should  be taken into account as reasons for granting permanent 

 residence."

 "The five year requirement is thus not a qualification but  merely a threshold to admit an application or a notice for an  application which must be made before 31 October 1990."

 "This approach acknowledges the need for tight controls but  tempers this approach with compassion for people who deserve  consideration on public policy and humanitarian grounds," Senator  Spindler concluded.
