 The Hon Peter Dutton MP  Minister for Immigration and Border Protection 

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 22 October 2015    

 PNG DELIVERS ON REFUGEE SETTLEMENT   

 The Australian Government welcomes the announcement from the Government of  Papua New Guinea that it will soon commence refugee settlement following approval by  the National Executive Committee for the National Refugee Policy. 

 The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Peter Dutton said the policy paved  the way for settlement in PNG of persons found to be refugees who had been  transferred under the Regional Resettlement Arrangement (RRA).  

 “This is delivering on the intentions of the RRA, consistent with the spirit of partnership  that exists between our two countries”. 

  “The Australian Government is committed to continuing to support the PNG-led  arrangements under the RRA. 

 “Consistent with the RRA, persons transferred to PNG, who are found to be refugees,  will be resettled in PNG. No-one will be resettled in Australia,” Mr Dutton said. 

 “The PNG Government has shown with this announcement its commitment to permit  those found to be refugees to get on with their lives and have a fresh start in this  dynamic nation with a growing economy.”
