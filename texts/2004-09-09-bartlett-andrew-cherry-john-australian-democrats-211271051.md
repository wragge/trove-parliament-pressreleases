 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/882 THURSDAY 9 SEPTEMBER 2004         SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT    SENATOR  JOHN  CHERRY  LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN  DEMOCRATS     DEMOCRAT  SENATOR  FOR  QUEENSLAND  Democrats in QLD key to strong Senate Need another Cherry Bite  The Democrats will win a Queensland Senate seat for the 10th time, if people look at the Democrats record, and particularly the work Senator Cherry has done to protect our unique environment and Queensland agricultural sectors from imported pests and disease, Leader Senator Andrew Bartlett, said at the Queensland Democrat Senate campaign launch today. Democrat candidate Senator John Cherry said, "Australia can’t afford to hand John Howard or Mark Latham absolute power and Queensland can’t afford a Senate without a strong Democrat team. "Howard offers a tax cut for the rich, Mark Latham says give them more.  Howard locks up asylum seekers, Mark Latham looks the other way. Howard bans same sex marriages, Mark Latham climbs into bed with him.  Howard sells out Australia on the US Free Trade Agreement, Mark Latham buys it," said Senator John Cherry. "Queenslanders differentiate between the important legislative role the Democrats play in the Senate and the role of the Greens as merely a protest vote.” Senator Cherry said the Greens if elected would just be a junior Labor Coalition partner. "In every division on legislation in the Senate in the last Parliament between Labor and the Coalition, the Greens voted with Labor.  "The Democrats are Australia's only strong and independent Senate party. Regardless of who wins Government, the Democrats in the Senate will force the Government to act honestly, fairly and justly. Senator Cherry said the Democrats would continue to walk the pavements and talk toQueenslanders in shopping malls, at retirement homes and parent teacher events in metropolitan and rural areas. "Queensland is one of only two states to have returned a Democrat senator in each of the last nine Federal elections. We are going to work hard to make it ten out of ten," Senator Cherry concluded. The Democrats Senate Team includes Bonny Bauer, a Tully-based rural activist and mother of five, and Linda Petrie, a Brisbane based community worker and counsellor.
