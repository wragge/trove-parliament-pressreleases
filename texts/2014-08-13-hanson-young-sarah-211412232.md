 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, August 13, 2014   

 Australia must commit to emergency intake of  Iraqi refugees, Greens   

 The Australian Greens have called on the Abbott government to undertake an emergency intake of  refugees from the Iraqi crisis.   

 “The Abbott government must commit to an emergency intake of refugees from Iraq, and it needs to  happen now,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Iraqi men, women and children are in desperate need and Australia has to step up and protect as  many of them as possible.   

 “Any humanitarian mission needs to be backed up by a commitment from Australia to increase its  refugee intake from the region.   

 “In addition, the Abbott government must stop returning Iraqi refugees who are already here in  Australia.   

 “Instead of punishing those who have fled Iraq, Tony Abbott must announce a moratorium on  returning refugees to a warzone.   

 “Slashing the refugee quota by more than 6,000 places after the election was an irresponsible move  from the Abbott government.   

 “By increasing our refugee intake and focussing on regions that are in crisis, as well as countries in  our area, Australia could lead a genuine regional solution.”
