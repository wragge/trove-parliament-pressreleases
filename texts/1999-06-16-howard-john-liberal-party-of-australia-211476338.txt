  PRIME MINISTER

  

 16 June 1999

  

  TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER

  THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP

  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, SYDNEY

  

  Subjects: Care workers; Kosovar refugees, Justice Callinan

  

 E&OE

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 The release of the Care workers, you know Steve Pratt 
and Peter Wallace, was that discussed at any level by NATO and [inaudible] 
about it, the resolution?

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 Well from our point of view we asked that the Americans 
and the British, I made direct approaches to Tony Blair and to Bill 
Clinton. I spoke to Bill Clinton on the phone last week as you know 
about lamb and other matters. And I raised the position of Pratt and 
Wallace with him and asked that consistent obviously with their other 
obligations that that matter be uppermost and be kept in mind.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 So what’s the latest? Do you have any idea when 
they may be set free?

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 Well I don’t know anything more than what Alexander 
Downer has said. It’s one of those delicate difficult situations where 
we are keen naturally to do everything we can to have them released. 
That depends to the ultimate extent on the personal whim of one man 
and we must have our eye on the ball the whole time. And that is doing 
and saying things that are most likely to help bring about their release.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Prime Minister, what is your reaction to the news 
that some of the Kosovar refugees are refusing to get of buses in Singleton?

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 I think that matter’s being handled pretty well 
on the ground. I have no doubt that the overwhelming majority of these 
refugees are immensely grateful for the generosity of the Australian 
community. I don’t want to say any more than that.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 On another matter, will Coalition Senators be part 
of an inquiry if there is one into Justice Callinan?

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

  No.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Why not?

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 Because there are no grounds for an inquiry, and an 
inquiry would be nothing other than an unnecessary pursuit of somebody 
who’s eminently suitable for the High Court of Australia.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 But if it went ahead would it not be better to have 
somebody argue that case in the inquiry?

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 No, no. We don’t believe any inquiry is necessary 
and we won’t be supporting one, and there is no justification at all. 
The full federal court actually found that the comments made by the 
judge at first instance were quite unnecessary and irrelevant to the 
finding in the case.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Would that inquiry upset your relationship with the 
Democrats at all? You’re going to have to deal with them as…

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 No no no. We deal with the Democrats on the merits 
of individual issues. In relation to taxation we’ve reached a very 
good agreement and I greatly respected and appreciated the negotiating 
approach of the leader of the Australian Democrats. Both of us recognise 
that on other issues we will not be on the same side. And that’s their 
right, that’s in the nature of the political process. They were elected 
as Australian Democrats and they’re under no obligation other than 
to pursue their own programme and they are doing that by cooperating 
with us in relation to taxation. On other matters, well we take them 
as we come. And I recognise that on some issues they’ll be with us, 
on many they won’t be. And I don’t think it otherwise and I don’t 
think anything needs anything other than that.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 So if the Senate calls for information from the Government 
regarding Justice Callinan would the Government comply?

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 The Government will do the right thing and that is 
vote against an inquiry into Justice Callinan because it’s not in 
the interests of the High Court of Australia that it be conducted. We 
see it as nothing other than a bit of a political vendetta by the Labor 
Party against a man who was involved as a lawyer, as he is obliged to 
do through the ethics of his profession in cases involving Labor luminaries. 
And we think there’s a bit of payback on the part of the Labor Party.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Does that mean the information will be released or 
not?

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 It simply means we’ll do the right thing as we always 
do in these matters. Thank you.
