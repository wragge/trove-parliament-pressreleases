 MEDIA RELEASE

 UNHCR SUPPORTS LABOR POLICY OF RELEASING THE CHILDREN

 Today’s news that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) regional representative has labelled Australia’s mandatory detention system the “most severe” in the Western world lends more support to Labor’s policy of releasing all children from high security immigration detention centres.

 Despite the groundswell of views from UN organisations, groups assisting asylum seekers and others in the community, the Howard Government belligerently insists that children be jailed held behind razor wire.

 Two months ago, the “Damaging Kids” report documented the extremely high rates of self-harm in Australia’s detention centres.  That report also documented the terrible psychological impact on children of witnessing such events.  Now, both UNHCR and UNICEF have highlighted the fact that Australia’s policy breaches the Refugee Convention and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

 It is now more than six months since Labor leader Simon Crean called for all children to be released from behind the razor wire of Australia’s high security immigration detention centres.

 Yet despite a trial at Woomera demonstrating the success of more humane arrangements for children, the Howard Government continues to lock up children.  Children should be allowed to live outside the razor wire, in Woomera alternate detention trial surroundings or be fostered into the community if unaccompanied.

 It is a matter of grave concern that not one single Liberal or National MP disagrees with defenceless children being held behind razor wire and forced to witness terrifying acts of self-harm.

 Labor will continue to demand an approach which is both tough on border security but more compassionate in the way it deals with asylum seekers.
