 NIPS 70/96 LABOR UNDERMINES BALANCED IMMIGRATION PROGRAM

 Opposition obstruction will undermine a sensible and planned migration program and regrettably  might undermine public confidence in immigration the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural  Affairs, Philip Ruddock said today.

 “The Opposition has outlined its intention to use the Senate to obstruct changes the Government  has announced to bring the Migration Program back under control," Mr Ruddock said.

 In announcing the 1996-97 Program o f 74,000, the Government sought to restore the balance  between skilled and family migration, while maintaining its commitment to non-discriminatory  selection criteria.

 “The former Government left us with a Program that was out o f balance and rapidly losing public  confidence. Family migration had grown significantly at the expense of the skill categories which  bring substantial economic benefit to the country," Mr Ruddock said.

 "We have accepted responsibility for rectifying this situation, but the Opposition is intent on  obstructing the Government's ability to manage the program."

 "The Opposition says they accept the level o f 74,000, but they want to deny us the management  tools to deliver that program in a balanced and responsible manner."

 The Opposition has announced it will oppose Regulations that: â¢ require sponsors in the Preferential Family category to be Australian citizens â¢ allow refugees to bring their immediate families into Australia under the Humanitarian  Program â¢ recognise English language skills in the Concessional Family category which has a high 

 skills component â¢ require the majority of an intending migrant's children to be in Australia before they can  be sponsored as a parent under balance o f family â¢ meet the Coalition election commitment to seek full cost recovery o f English language 

 tuition charges

 â¢ facilitate the Commonwealth to recoup benefits claimed by migrants within the first two  years â¢ remove a loophole allowing off-shore applicants to remain in Australia on a bridging visa,  while their application is processed overseas.

 "I am stunned that the Opposition would have the audacity to seek to undermine the management  o f the migration program in this way," Mr Ruddock said.

 FAMILIES OF REFUGEES ENTERING UNDER THE HUMANITARIAN PROGRAM   By obstructing the regulation allowing refugees and humanitarian program entrants to bring in  immediate family members under the Humanitarian Program, the Opposition is penalising refugees  and dispensing with similar measures it planned to introduce.

 The former Minister issued a news release on 25 January 1996, foreshadowing measures for  humanitarian entrants to "ensure that those family members seeking to reunite with their immediate  families in Australia, will be given the same benefits as those they are seeking to join." The  Opposition is now turning its back on refugees.

 BALANCE OF FAMILY In 1995-96, the number of parent visas rose by 74%. The change to the Balance of Family  category addresses this situation. The Regulation changes the existing test where the migrant 

 needs 50% of their children in Australia, to a test under which the majority o f children need to be  resident.

 CITIZENSHIP SPONSORS The Regulation which came into effect on 1 October means that generally only Australian citizens  can sponsor immediate family members under the Preferential Family category, which includes 

 spouses, dependent children and fiances. Under the Concessional Family category, applicants  already receive points if their sponsor is an Australian citizen.

 At a time when the size of the Migration Program has been reduced, but demand for places is still  high, the Government believes people who have made a commitment to Australia, should be given  priority.

 ENGLISH LANGUAGE SKILLS - CONCESSIONAL FAMILY The recognition of English language skills in the Concessional Family category is entirely  appropriate. It is primarily a category to select skilled migrants, where applicants are given a  concession because their relatives in Australia undertake to help them settle. However, English 

 language ability has been a factor in Concessional Family selection for many years. English is also  one o f the most important factors in the successful settlement of migrants.

 This Regulation brings this skill-based category into line with other skill categories such as the  Independent and Business Skills categories.

 ENGLISH TUITION COST RECOVERY The Government made an election commitment to introduce full cost recovery in English language  tuition for migrants who are coming to Australia to obtain an economic benefit. The Opposition  has decided the Australian community should continue to heavily subsidise those people.

 There is no tuition fee for people arriving under Preferential Family or the Humanitarian Program.

 ASSURANCE OF SUPPORT The Government had introduced measures to facilitate the Commonwealth recouping benefits  claimed by migrants in the non-humanitarian categories in their first two years. This type o f  measure was deemed appropriate by the former Government, but not, it appears by the current  Opposition.

 BRIDGING VISAS FO R  OFFSHORE APPLICATIONS The Government had taken steps to remove a loophole which allowed some applicants to live,  work and receive Medicare benefits in Australia (potentially for extended periods) on a bridging  visa while their off-shore migrant application was processed overseas. The measure was designed  to remove an inequity, that allowed certain people to enjoy the benefits o f Australia, while other  applicants had to remain overseas.
