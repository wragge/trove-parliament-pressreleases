  I LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION I  TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE - TREASURY GARDENS  MELBOURNE, 22 APRIL 2003 

  E & OE - PROOF ONLY 

  Subjects: Tax burden; Asylum seekers; Howard retirement;  Telstra & sweatshop labour; leadership 

  I n  three weeks time, the eighth budget will be brought down by the Howard-  Costello Government. It is already shaping up as a bad budget for Australian  fa mi I ies. 

  This is the highest taxing Government in Australia’s history. It‘s slugging  Australian families by higher taxes after every budget. I n  the seven years that  this Government has been in office they have given only one tax cut. I n   Labor’s last seven years of office we gave a significant number of tax cuts. I n   fact, in the thirteen years we were in office we gave seven tax cuts in total. 

  But it‘s not just the fact that only one tax cut’s been given. This is a  Government that’s also introduced the GST, and it’s also got $31 billion in  hidden taxes and charges - three since the GST was introduced. 

  What you‘ve got to ask yourself is why is it that if this Government is the  highest taxing Government in history it can’t afford to give a tax cut to  families and it can‘t afford to save bulk billing for Australian families? That‘s  the question that has to be asked. 

  Why a Government that taxes the highest in the history of this country can’t  afford to save Medicare and can’t afford to give a tax cut? They‘re the  questions that have to be directed to this Government. They’re the questions  that this Government have been avoiding because it’s been ignoring these 

  issues in the fog of war. 

  But we’re going to turn the spotlight on the Government in the lead up to the  budget. We‘ll turn the spotlight on them in a way that demands they give tax  relief to Australian families, and demands that they save Medicare by 

  1 

  restoring bulk billing options for all Australians - not just those with  concession ca rd hold i ng s , 

  JOURNALIST:  that the Federal Government should do now?  What do you think - in relation to the asylum seekers - 

  CREAN: Well, if the boat is on its way - and there is still to be confirmed  reports about that - it again shows the failure of this Government to have  negotiated an agreement with Indonesia that would prevent this boat coming  here. I can‘t believe the Government has sat on its hands now for a year and  a half and hasn’t negotiated an arrangement with the Indonesians to prevent  this happening. When Labor was in office we reached agreements with our 

  neighbours. Agreements with China, for example, to ensure that people either  didn’t come or, if they did come, they were returned to their country. They’re  the sorts of agreements this Government should be negotiating but it’s doing  nothing. And if this boat arrives it is a failure of their policy to have reached 

  an agreement on that issue. 

  JOURNALIST: Mr Crean is there another Tampa situation with this boat? 

  CREAN: Well, I just make the point we should be able to avoid it if we’d  reached agreement with the Indonesians. But our relationship with Indonesia  is so fractured and the Government hasn‘t done anything to finalise  arrangements in terms of people smugglers, boat people, that we again are  facing this threat. 

  JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, I’ve just a couple of questions. John Howard  has said he will soon reveal his plans for the future regarding possible  retirement. Do you think this is going to destabilise our country and also, do  you think Costello may be in on it? 

  CREAN:  Howard. Under their joint stewardship they’re the highest taxing Government  in Australia’s history and they’re about to kill off Medicare. It doesn‘t matter  who leads them, Australian families are going to suffer. And what we’re 

  saying is - get the spotlight on the budget. Get some relief for Australian  families who are struggling under financial pressure and ensure that bulk  billing is restored and Medicare is saved. 

  Look, it doesn’t matter whether it’s Peter Costello or John 

  JOURNALIST:  announce his future?  Do you think it will destabilise Australia if he does 

  CREAN: Australian families are already destabilised. They’re destabilised  because they‘re suffering under the weight of the highest taxing Government  in Australia‘s history. They‘re destabilised because they can’t find a doctor  who bulk bills. And today’s figures have come out that give the breakdown all  around the country on bulk billing and the pattern is there right across the  country - bulk billing is falling. If you haven’t got a doctor who bulk bills, 

  2 

  you‘ve got many families who will be destabilised because they can‘t afford to  go to a doctor. These are families for whom, now, the Medicare card counts  for nothing. Their credit card is what the doctor asks for and the Medicare  card doesn‘t count. 

  JOURNALIST: Just my other question is also just your comments in  relation to - I don‘t know if you’re familiar with - the Telstra sweatshop?  There are allegations that they’re using outsourcing? 

  CREAN:  billion dollar profits, cutting jobs in Australia and the wages of Australian  people who are able to be employed here and earn and support their families.  And farming those jobs off to sweated labour in overseas countries, this is not  the way Australia should develop. Australia should be proud of its ability to  generate high-skilled, high-waged jobs. And Telstra, in turning its back on  Australian workers and farming that work out to sweatshops overseas is not  the way one would expect a company half-owned by the Australian 

  Government to perform. 

  Well, I just find this outrageous. This is Telstra making multi- 

  JOURNALIST: Besides Medicare what other tax relief will you offer? 

  CREAN:  weeks time and we will have  a better idea as to what the true state of the  books are. We still haven’t been told how much the war costs, how much the 

  Pacific Solution has cost. But I’ll be having more to say in my budget  response on the type of relief that Australian families should be getting. 

  Obviously we have to wait and see what‘s in this budget in three 

  JOURNALIST:  now, will you?  [inaudible] ... to a tax, but you won’t commit to a tax cut 

  CREAN:  point three weeks out from the budget that this is a Government that‘s taxing  Australians and Australian families at the highest level they’ve ever been  taxed and it still tells us it can‘t afford to give a tax cut and it still can’t afford  to save Medicare. What sort of a Government is it that collects the largest 

  amount of revenue from families and still can’t afford to save Medicare or to  give tax cuts. 

  I‘ll wait and see what’s in the budget. I‘m simply making the 

  JOURNALIST: So will you present the Labor Party’s tax policy? 

  CREAN: I‘ll be having something to more to say about these issues when  I see what’s in the budget on Tuesday the 13th and 1/11 respond to those later.  JOURNALIST: Will we get those policies before the next election? 

  CREAN:  after I know what’s in the budget. But what I do know now is this - what I  know is this is a budget that will be built on a revenue base that taxes 

  You‘ll just have to wait and see what I have to say two days 

  3 

  Australians at the highest level they’ve ever been taxed. And, it’s also a  budget that intends to means test access to bulk billing and to introduce co-  payments for families above $30,000 of income. So not only are Australian  families struggling because they‘re being taxed more, they’re having their 

  services reduced more. They’re being hit from both ends - taxed more and  less services being made available. That‘s why they’re hurting. And it’s relief  to them that will be a key priority for the Labor Party and I’II be having  something to say about it after the budget. 

  JOURNALIST:  tax cuts, it might come in another measure. Is that what you’re saying?  So you’re not actually committing to relief in the form of 

  CREAN: Well, I‘m saying wait until my response to the budget. I have to  wait and see what the budget parameters are. The Government won’t tell us.  But what we do know is that it’s the highest taxing Government in history and  it intends to kill of Medicare. Both of those issues are going to hurt families  and that‘s where they need relief. 

  JOURNALIST:  saying are highly unfair?  Besides Medicare though, what other taxes are you 

  CREAN: Well there are $31 billion in hidden levies and charges. You’ve  got the milk tax, the sugar tax, the Ansett tax - all of these taxes that they  said they wouldn’t be introducing when the GST was brought in. They‘re just  three examples of it. So, the so-called ‘ hidden taxes‘ that the GST was 

  supposed to get rid of - not only hasn’t it happened, they‘ve introduced more  taxes. So, you’ve got families hit by the $31 billion of hidden levies and  charges, by the GST and by bracket creep. That’s why Australian families are  struggling. That’s why they can’t afford to make ends meet. And if you‘ve got  a Government also making it harder for them to get to a doctor - costing  families more to go to a doctor -they‘re being hit at the other end as well. 

  It’s why families are under pressure and our priority will be to give relief to  fa mi lies. 

  JOURNALIST:  would you set about removing those $31 billion in hidden taxes?  I f  you won Government at the next election though, 

  CREAN: What we would set about doing is ensuring that relief on the tax  burden on Australian families was delivered. And we also set about ensuring  bulk billing is restored and Medicare saved. These are key priorities that I’II be  committing to. 

  JOURNALIST:  e I ect i on?  And you will take the Government, your Party to the next 

  CREAN: Absolutely.

  JOURNALIST: Do you think Greg Sword‘s comments over the weekend,  yesterday, were helpful towards the people agitating against your leadership? 

  CREAN: Look, I‘ll be taking the Party to the next election. You can  continue to ask about it if you like, if you think it’s important. But what the  Australian public think is important is why they’re being taxed more and  getting less services? That‘s what matters to them. And I suggest you go out 

  and poll some of them as to what they think the most important issues  around is. 

  JOURNALIST: . . . [ inaudi ble] ... election? 

  CREAN:  taxed more? Why are they getting less services? Do they want bulk billing  restored? Do they want tax relief? Go and ask them about that because  they‘re the key issues. 

  They know the key that matters to them is why are they being 

  JOUNRNALIST:  make ...[ inaudible]?  Are there any circumstances under which you wouldn’t 

  CREAN: None at all. I’II be leading the Party to the next election and I’II  be doing it on the basis of policies and programs that improve the lot of  families, that reduce their tax burden, that saves Medicare and also ensures  availability and affordability for university and TAFE places. These are key 

  issues that matter to Australian families. I‘d also be taking a program in terms  of repairing our environment and a program that build us as a nation, a more  secure nation. These are the key areas of policy differentiation that I’II be  taking the Party to at the next election. 

  JOURNALIST:  you prepared to put the Party ahead of yourself?  What issues are surrounding your falling popularity? Are 

  CREAN:  policy direction of this country. But I tell you what I put uppermost and that is  the needs of Australian families. I’m in politics to serve them and to lead in  their direction policies that meet their aspirations and their needs. And quite  frankly, the issues that they’re concerned about are education, and health 

  and the crippling burden of tax that they’re suffering under this Government.  These are the areas that they want relief on and they want a Party and a  leader that will deliver on that. 

  I‘ve always put the Party first in terms of the interests and the 

  JOURNALIST:  surfacing ... a return to leadership?  Why do you think Kim Beazley‘s name has been 

  CREAN: Well, look, all sorts of names get bandied at various times. What  I’m saying to you though is that they get bandied by a select number of  people in the press gallery. They’re not the issues that matter to Australian  families. What families want to know is why am I paying more taxes? Why am 

  5 

  I getting less services? That’s what they want to know and they’re the answers that 1/11 be giving them. And they’re the answers that the Labor Party will be giving them and 1/11 be leading the Labor Party in terms of those answers come the next election. JOUNRNALIST: Have you spoken with Kim Beazley in the last few days? CREAN: away before that. But I speak to Kim on a regular basis. No, well I‘ve been away with my family over Easter and he was JOUNRNALIST: Does the leadership get mentioned? CREAN: Nice try. What gets mentioned are the issues that he finds in his electorate. The electorate of Brand is no different to all the electorates around the country - crippling tax burdens, the death of Medicare, the inability for families to get their kids into university places even though they’ve earned the right to go. These are the sorts of issues that matter to Australian families and the issues that I‘ll be addressing. JOUNRNALIST: overshadowing other issues? Are you frustrated that the leadership seems to be CREAN: No, look I’ve been around too long to let frustration worry me. What I’m worried about are the policy responses to the needs that Australian families are looking for. And I repeat - families are under the highest taxed pressure they‘ve ever been, they’re losing services and they’re wondering about what the future is for their kids. They want a Government and a leader that stands up for those issues and offers constructive solutions. And they‘ll have that from me. (ENDS)  6
