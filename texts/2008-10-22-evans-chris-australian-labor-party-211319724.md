 Liberal Party’s border security deceit 

 Wednesday 22 October 2008 

 The Liberal Party has been caught deceiving the public over  funding for Australia’s border security measures. 

 The Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Dr Sharman  Stone, and the Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration  and Citizenship, Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells have both  falsely claimed that $67.4 million has been “stripped out of the  critical area of border security and immigration processing.” 

 The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional  Affairs today heard that the figures quoted by Dr Stone and  Senator Fierravanti-Wells in fact relate to the dismantling of the  Howard Government’s failed Pacific solution and the abolition of  the unjust Temporary Protection visa regime. 

 The committee heard that the Budget papers clearly show that the  closure of the offshore processing centres in Nauru and Manus  Island results in $68.7 million in savings over five years.  

 The Budget papers show that the $68.7 million saving is offset by  a $1.3 million cost for the abolition of the Temporary Protection  visas granted to refugees by the previous government.  

 Dr Stone and Senator Fierravanti-Wells are misleading the public  by falsely claiming that the $67.4 million figure is a cut to border  security measures.  

 It is also worth noting that the Budget papers reveal a $116 million  increase in total net resourcing for the Department of Immigration  and Citizenship for 2008-09.
