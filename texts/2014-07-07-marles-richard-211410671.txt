 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 LABOR CONCERNED OVER RETURN OF ASYLUM SEEKERS    

 The Abbott Government has today confirmed 41 asylum seekers have been returned  to Sri Lanka.     

 Labor has concerns about the integrity of this new method of processing people at  sea and en masse and how this complies with Australiaâ€™s international obligations  under relevant conventions.    

 Immigration Minister Scott Morrison must explain what process is underway to  determine the refugee status of another reported 153 persons aboard a second  vessel that was detected near Christmas Island.    

 It is not good enough for Scott Morrison to leave the country without providing a  transparent account of what has occurred on our seas over the last week and a half.     

 Scott Morrison has been citing operational reasons for not commenting on this event  for more than a week only to throw out those apparent protocols when it is  politically convenient for him to pat himself on the back.     

 The appropriate mechanism for processing those who arrive to Australia by sea is  the Regional Resettlement Arrangement, which Labor put in place on July 19 last  year.    

 Mr Morrison needs to explain why the Government neglected to act in accordance  with the Regional Resettlement Arrangement, which would have provided for people  to be processed on Christmas Island at greater efficiency and transparency.
