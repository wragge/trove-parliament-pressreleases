 Transfer of Detainees from Maribyrnong to Baxter

 VPS 096/2005

 Minister for Immigration, Amanda Vanstone today expressed her extreme disappointment and anger at the treatment of five people during a  transfer between Maribyrnong and Baxter Detention facilities in September 2004. 

 ‘When these complaints were first brought to my attention, I asked the Department to review the incident and have the complaints of the  individuals concerned thoroughly examined,’ the Minister said. 

 The Minister said she had been briefed on the outcome of an independent investigation, which she instructed be commissioned by the Department  of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

 ‘I am outraged at the treatment of these individual detainees,’ the Minister said.

 ‘The report substantiates most of the allegations made by detainees in their complaints. It is totally unacceptable and should not have occurred.

 ‘I am particularly annoyed that it appears this happened because operational aspects of the contract were not followed, resulting in serious  violations of contractual requirements and the Immigration Detention Standards (IDS). 

 ‘This is not acceptable, and I expect better.

 ‘The Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Andrew Metcalfe, has assured me that immediate  action is underway to deal with this matter and his separate statement details that action.

 ‘This is a very regrettable incident and I feel extreme sympathy for the people involved,’ Senator Vanstone said.
