 Environmental refugees - Australia must back UN migration initiative     

 The Australian Greens today called on the Howard government to back a  United Nation's initiative to address the factors behind global  migration, including environmental refugees.   

 Greens climate change spokesperson Senator Christine Milne said the  release today of a report on the implications of climate change for the  Asia Pacific region and the British Met office's report that drought  could affect up to one third of the world's land, prompting mass  migrations of environmental refugees, pointed to the need for urgent  global action.   

 "Australian cannot ignore the fact that climate change is already  displacing people and will displace millions more in the coming  decades," Senator Milne said in Canberra.   

 "The Howard government's decision in 2002 to refuse Tuvalu's request to  accept its people in the event they are forced to evacuate the low-lying territory was immoral.   

 "Since Australia is one of the world's largest per capita emitters of  greenhouse gas emissions and has been undermining international efforts  to mitigate climate change, such as refusing to ratify the Kyoto  Protocol, there is a moral imperative for the Australian government to  back this UN initiative.   

 "The UN is seeking international support to host a series of forums in  different regions to look at global migration. The first forum will be  held in Belgium next year.   

 "The Greens are calling on the Australian government to support the  initiative by holding a forum in the region to focus particularly on  the influence that climate change will have in generating environmental  refugees.   

 "Australia also needs to support an amendment to the international  refugee convention to recognise environmental refugees so that their  asylum status is put beyond doubt and where necessary, they are able to  relocate safely."
