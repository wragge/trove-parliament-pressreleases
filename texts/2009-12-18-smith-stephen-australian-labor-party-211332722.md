 Australia elected to United Nations Peacebuilding Commission   

 

 I am pleased to announce Australia’s election to the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission for  2010.    

 The Peacebuilding Commission was established by the United Nations in 2005 to assist countries  emerging from conflict.  It brings together donors, international financial institutions and national  governments to provide strategic advice and harness finances and expertise from around the world to  assist countries emerging from conflict.   

 The Commission deals with post-conflict countries that have concluded a peace accord and where a  degree of security exists.  Its current focus is assisting Burundi, Central African Republic,  Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone.   

 Rebuilding society after conflict requires practical programs to promote reconciliation, the reintegration  of soldiers, the safe return of refugees to their homes, economic growth and a stronger, more  accountable government.    

 Australia has a long tradition of assisting governments prevent conflict and promote peace in unstable  environments in our region, including in the Solomon Islands and East Timor. Our peace building  expertise and experience will be a valuable asset to the work of the Commission.    

 Australia’s election to the Commission further demonstrates our contribution to international peace  and security and our commitment to the UN Charter and efforts to resolve disputes through the  international system.
