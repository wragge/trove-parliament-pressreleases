 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 YET AGAIN, RUDDOCK IS ‘INACTION MAN’

 The  Minister  for  Immigration,  Multicultural  &  Indigenous  Affairs,  Philip  Ruddock,  today showed  his  extreme  sensitivity  to  any  suggestion  that  he  was  less  than  tough  on  illegal immigration.  Having apparently successfully changed his public image from meek and mild to  hairy-chested  action  man,  today  the  reality  was  on  full  display  -  his  stance  on  illegal immigrants is highly selective.

 Last week he was caught out and embarrassed when his own Department admitted that they knew nothing of a blatant case of exploitation of a skilled foreign worker holding a sub-class 457 visa.  His Departmental head agreed that it was “of real concern” and the following day a Departmental  official  contacted  Mr  Rados  Stevanovic  regarding  the  expediting  of  his  case. Using  a  457  visa,  an  employer  sponsored  Mr  Stevanovic,  a  master  artist  famous  for  his religious frescoes and artwork, to paint a church.  For four years, Mr Stevanovic was paid an average  of  $163  a  week  and  was  forced  to  live  on-site  at  the  church  and  pay  for  his  work materials from his weekly salary.  He trained no one and worked alone.  (Sub-class 457 visas allow  employers  to  sponsor  an  overseas  employee  if  their  business  will  “advance  skills through  technology  or  training”  and  the  employer  agrees  to  “comply  with  Australian industrial laws”.)

 The  Department  agreed  that  they  effectively  have  no  power  to  stop  this  exploitation  and pursue  the  monies  owing  to  Mr  Stevanovic.   They  also  agreed  that  they  have  no  power  to investigate  and  fine  employers  who  fail  to  comply  with  agreements  made  with  the Department under business-sponsored visas.

 In Parliament today, the Minister mentioned Mr Stevanovic’s case, thanked the CFMEU for doing  the  work  his  Department  should  be  doing  then  made  a  completely  irrelevant  link  in relation to a refugee issue concerning the activities of another division of another state branch of the union.

 Minister, if you need to be reminded - the case of Rados Stevanovic involves a highly skilled foreign  worker  with  the  legal  right  to  work  in  Australia.   This  is  not  a  refugee  issue  and posturing on refugees won’t fix  the problem.  It’s about time the Minister applied the same zeal  to  employers  exploiting  foreign  workers  as  he  does  to  unauthorised  boat  arrivals. Australian  workers  deserve  a  Minister  who  takes  real  action  to  protect  their  wages  and conditions from being undermined by exploited foreign labour.
