 TRANSCRIPT 

 THE HON JOE HOCKEY MP 

 SHADOW TREASURER 

 DOORSTOP  ADELAIDE  29 AUGUST 2012 

 E&OE……………………………………………………………………………………… 

 JOURNALIST:    

 Mr Hockey, do you have any concerns about this $4 billion dental plan that has been introduced this  morning?   

 JOE HOCKEY:   

 This is another unfunded promise from Julia Gillard. I don't know where all the money is meant to  be coming from - massive multi billion dollar blowouts on dealing with asylum seeker boats,  massive commitments on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, on the Gonski review of 

 education, on submarines. Where is all this money coming from? Frankly, what we know is, Labor  is going to increase taxes. They have got to come clean. Whenever you hear them announce  anything, ask them "what taxes are you going to introduce to pay for all this?" 

 

 JOURNALIST:   

 Mr Hockey, Tanya Pliberseck has said today that they will cut the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme  that was set up under the Howard Government. She has described that as ‘poorly designed’ and that  it was being rorted by dentists - that is some of the money. It must be fairly difficult to be negative  about this policy that is going to help so many people.   

 JOE HOCKEY:   

 What are you talking about? I'm asking where the money is going to come from. They announce a  scheme that makes up a fraction of the amount of new money that Tanya Pliberseck committed  today. They have got a massive black hole with their announcement yesterday about the carbon tax.  The carbon tax is barely two months old and Greg Combet wants to tie the Australian economy to  the European economy and somehow that is not going to have an impact on Australia. If the carbon  price goes to $50 a tonne then Australian families are going to pay. If the carbon price goes to $10 a  tonne then the Budget is going to be a disaster zone and Australian families are going to pay  through higher taxes. I have never seen a more aggressive Government than I have seen with this.  In everything they do they are claiming big historic reforms. The net result is that Australians pay  more tax.

 JOURNALIST:   

 Do you support the need for this dental scheme and the fact that it will provide help for people in  regional and remote areas, and (people on) low incomes and children?   

 JOE HOCKEY:   

 The Commonwealth had a very good dental scheme which we set up and which was working. If it  was begin rorted, it was being rorted on Labor's watch. Again, this is typical of this Government.  They need to announce big heroic reforms but they are not telling anyone how they are going to pay  for it. Where was this in the Budget just three or four months ago? Where was this huge new dental  scheme in the Budget? Where was the budgetary impact of some of the decisions the Government  has  made such as the full rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme or the Gonski  review? That wasn't in the Budget numbers four months ago.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 So if you win Government will you scrap this scheme?   

 JOE HOCKEY:   

 We haven't seen it. They announced it today and I don't think Labor will actually deliver this  scheme. I actually don't think they will deliver it. Sadly, all they are doing is raising expectations  that they'll never meet. Labor never meet these things. They make  the big heroic promises but they  never do it.  All they do is increase taxes. You know that under Labor, whatever they say about tax,  you'll end up paying more.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Moving to state politics, there has been some speculation about Isobel Redmond's position. What do  you say about her performance and do you support her remaining state Opposition leader?   

 JOE HOCKEY:   

 I always support the parliamentary leader. That's what I do.    

 JOURNALIST:   

 What do you say about her performance? Do you think it has been a strong performance?   

 JOE HOCKEY:   

 I think Isobel Redmond is a very good person. She's a very decent person. She's not a politician's  politician. She is actually a real person with real views about the destiny of the state. I like her. I  like a straight talker. I like someone that is fearless and that is honest and Isobel Redmond is one of  those people.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 And do you think she should remain leader?

 JOE HOCKEY:   

 That is a matter for the parliamentary party.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 You've made serious comments about the militancy of unions and the CFMEU. What do you think  should be happening in Melbourne at the moment with these [inaudible]?   

 JOE HOCKEY:   

 Well let me say emphatically - the unions wanted to see a slowdown in the mining boom. They  wanted to see investment fall away, as revealed by the Australian Workers Union policy document  released just in April of this year. They thought it was good to slow down the mining boom. The  AWU controls one quarter of the federal Labor caucus. Wayne Swan and Bill Shorten are proud  members. The AWU put Julia Gillard in her job and now why would the AWU be upset about the  loss of Olympic Dam or the delay at Port Hedland? Why would they be upset about it? They called  for it in April this year! So let's do away with the crocodile tears and focus on the facts that when it  comes to larger projects falling over - the union movement welcomed it and the Labor Party doesn't  care. All they care about is the next election which I think is probably not too far away.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 What about the CFMEU dispute with Grocon?   

 JOE HOCKEY:    

 That is typical. The Labor Party got rid of the policeman - the Australian Building and Construction  Commission. I see the new Fair Work agency is monitoring the situation. You have got industrial  thuggery on the streets of Melbourne and it's coming to a place near you because the Labor Party  supports the union bosses over the workers and supports the union bosses over the profitability of 

 business and the growing of the economy.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 The ABCC'S first prosecution against Ark Tribe failed in the South Australian courts and very  recently the prosecution was ordered to pay $100,000 in legal costs to Mr Tribe. Doesn't that show  it doesn't actually work? 

 

 JOE HOCKEY:   

 No. The ABCC worked because the level of industrial disputation on construction sites dropped  dramatically when it was in place. We got on with building Australia. We were not threatened by  thuggery out of union bosses. Unfortunately it is those same union bosses that put the Labor Party  in Government, keep the Labor Party in Government and they are funding the re-election of the  Labor Party. Frankly Australians are much poorer for it.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 In regards to the subs - would a Coalition Government guarantee they would be built in South  Australia?

 JOE HOCKEY:    

 What we have previously said is that we are waiting for the review on submarines. The Government  hasn't even finished the feasibility studies on building the subs. Given that it is $36 billion plus, I'd  say to you, don't believe what Labor says when it comes to submarines. Thank you.
