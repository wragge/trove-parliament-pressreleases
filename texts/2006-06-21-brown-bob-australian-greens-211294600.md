 Senator Bob Brown   Senator for Tasmania  

 

 Congratulations! 

 

 Senator Brown, 21st June 2006   

 Greens Leader Bob Brown says that the government rebels who have stood against  the exile of refugees to Nauru deserve congratulations.    

 "They are brave hearts for decency. Minister Vanstone should close the line to Jakarta  and ask these good Liberals to give her advice instead".   Senator Brown said.
