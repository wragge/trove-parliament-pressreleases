 ALP and Government Join One Nation in Abuse of Parliament on Migration Bills

 Greens Senator Bob Brown has condemned the Government and Opposition for the handling of 7 draconian migration bills in the Senate today.

 "They have gone right across to put Pauline Hanson's ideas into law.

 "The Opposition and Government have abandoned proper parliamentary process in agreeing to Government motions that allow legislation to pass while it is still before a Senate committee," Senator Brown said.

 "Other legislation hasn't gone to a committee at all.

 "The package of seven bills which will be debated through to midnight, contain a monumental crackdown on the rights of asylum seekers and Australians involved with them.

 "I will be moving a number of amendments to the package of legislation including one to remove the mandatory sentencing provisions in the Government's border protection bill.
