 MEDIA STATEMENT 

 

 

 Minister for Immigration Tony Burke will join Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in Papua  New Guinea for a series of high level meetings with the Government.   

 Mr Burke said he will be involved in meetings to discuss asylum seekers and the  progress of construction on Manus Island.                                                                                                                                      

 "Given the significance of the cooperation between Australia and Papua New Guinea  the Prime Minister has asked me to join him to participate in those meetings that are  relevant to my portfolio,” Mr Burke said.   

 "Papua New Guinea has a critical role within a regional approach and has provided  assistance to Australian Governments for some years through facilities on Manus  Island.   

 "This trip will allow me to get an update on the progress of developing the centre on  Manus Island in advance of making a personal visit to Manus Island in a few weeks  time.   

 "These meetings are particularly significant in the lead up to the summit announced  by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.”
