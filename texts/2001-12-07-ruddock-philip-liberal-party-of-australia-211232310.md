 Minister to Join International Discussions on Asylum Seekers

 MPS 191/2001

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock leaves for Europe today for discussions that will focus on migration, refugee and asylum issues, as well as indigenous matters and temporary entry.

 Mr Ruddock will visit the UK for talks with the British Government on the issue of border arrivals, asylum seekers, British plans for a migration program and on the matter of the return of Indigenous remains.

 The Minister will also attend the Ministerial Council of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in Geneva to mark the 50th anniversary of the Refugees Convention and for discussions on the future direction of the UNHCR.

 From there Mr Ruddock will hold discussions in Spain regarding on-shore border arrivals and asylum seekers, and will sign an agreement providing reciprocal arrangements for Working Holiday visas. The meetings in Madrid will also cover Spain’s role in assuming the Presidency of the European Community next year.

 While Mr Ruddock is overseas, Senator Chris Ellison will be acting Minister.
