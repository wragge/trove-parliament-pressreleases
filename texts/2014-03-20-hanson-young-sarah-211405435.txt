 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Thursday, 20 March 2014   

 Manus inquiry only beginning to reveal the  awful truth   

 The harrowing testimony emerging from the PNG inquiry into the Manus Island detention camp  is beginning to show just how unacceptable the conditions actually are, the Australian Greens  have said.   

 “The Manus Island camp is a stain on Australia’s commitment to human rights,” the Greens’  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “When I was on Manus Island last year the conditions were appalling and, after the influx of  people under the Abbott Government, things have become even worse.   

 “Tony Abbott’s refusal to visit Manus Island while he is in PNG shows just how important this  government thinks the suffering of refugees actually is.   

 “What we’ve heard so far about conditions in the camp is just the tip of the iceberg.   

 “Indefinite detention of innocent people, with no a pathway to release or resettlement, is an  extremely serious breach of any person’s human rights.   

 “The Manus Island centre is untenable and will eventually be closed down but, the longer it  takes, the more damage it will do.”
