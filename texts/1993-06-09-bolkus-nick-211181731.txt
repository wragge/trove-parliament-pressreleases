 NEW MEMBERS FOR IMMIGRATION REVIEW TRIBUNAL

 The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus, has appointed three new members to the Immigration Review Tribunal.

 They are Ms Kim Ross, Ms Victoria Rubensohn and Mr Kim Wilson, who have been appointed as part-time members of the Tribunal in Sydney.

 All have previous experience as members of other Commonwealth administrative tribunals. Ms Rubensohn and Mr Wilson were both members of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and Ms Ross has been a member of the Veterans' Review Board.

 Senator Bolkus said the new members were needed to meet the Tribunal's increased workload, particularly in Sydney.

 The Immigration Review Tribunal considers appeals against certain decisions made by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, and is expected to receive about 2000 applications in 1992-93.

 It does not review decisions on refugee status or humanitarian grounds.
