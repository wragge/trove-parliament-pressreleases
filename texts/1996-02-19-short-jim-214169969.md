 Keating Duplicitous on Social Security Benefits for Migrants

 I  hc Prime Minister's statements on the SBS “Dateline” program shows that he will go to any lengths to  misrepresent our policy and to hide his own record,

 Keating’s rhetoric would have us believe that currently r!1  new migrants have full access In all benefits upon arrival. -

 This is NOT true.

 In January 1993 the Keating Labor Government introduced u six month wail alter arrival in Australia,  for migrants, other than refugee and humanitarian migrants, before they become eligible to receive most  welfare benefits,

 The Coalition’s proposal lo extend the six months to two years is simply an extended application o f the  principle established by Labor in 1993.

 Keating’S rhetoric would also have us believe that his Government takes full responsibility for the  support of all new migrants. Again this is not true, .·

 The Keating Government currently requires sponsors v f Family Reunion migrants to prove that they can  support their family members. Sponsors must sign Assurances of Support whereby they agree to pay  back all welfare costs their family members may incur after arrival, before they are granted entry. These  Assurances of Support are, however, poorly enforced and collected.

 Once again the Prime Minister has stretched his credibility to breaking point.

 If he really believes that it is “callous” to have a waiting period for eligibility for welfare benefits for  non-humanitarian migrants, then why did he establish a waiting period in the first place?

 If he believes that the sole responsibility for support o f new migrants rests with the government, then he  should remove the required Assurances o f Support, O f course he will do no such tiring.

 The Coalition believes that the support o f sponsored migrants is a shared responsibility between the  sponsors and (he government, All sponsored migrants currently arc selected for entry into Australia,  ahead Of other applicants, on the basis of their sponsor’s ability to provide for them. Our policy simply  gives intent to current government practice.

 Under the Coalition’s proposals:

 â¢ All refugee and humanitarian migrants will be eligible for welfare benefits immediately on arrival in  Australia

 o The proposals will not effect anyone already in Australia. They relate only to future non-  reJugcc/h umanitari an migrants, .

 o All migrants will have access to Medicare and family allowance immediately on arrival.

 â¢  No one will be left without support, There will be u safely net, in the form of a special allowance, for  those migrants whose circumstances change significantly after arrival in Australia for reasons beyond  their personal control.
