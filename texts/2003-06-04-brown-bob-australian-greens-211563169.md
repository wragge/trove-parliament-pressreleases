 Bob Brown, Senator for Tasmania

 Williams Must Explain Raids: Brown  MOU to Force Return of Iranian Asylum Seekers Must be Made Public   

 Attorney General Daryl Williams owes the public a clear explanation for raids he  directed on ex-Iranian households in 3 capital cities, Greens Senator Bob Brown said  today.    

 “The Howard government accepts the Bush doctrine that Iran is part of the Axis of  Evil. Yet it is raiding peaceful opponents of that Evil here in Australia,” Senator  Brown said.    

 “There is double-dealing afoot. While backing the White House’s option of a future  war against the Iranian clerics, the government is dealing with them to forcibly  repatriate hundreds of refugees who have fled their rule.    

 “The Government should come clean and immediately release the MOU signed with  the Iranian officials concerning the planned forced return of Iranian asylum seekers  currently detained in Australia.    

 “If the Mojahedeen is credibly planning terrorism in Australia or from Australia, Mr  Williams should say so.    

 “This is a government which wants to give ASIO the power to secretly detain  innocent Australians without usual legal rights.    

 “The Government should explain the raids or expect public opinion to harden against  giving ASIO new police state powers,” Senator Brown said.
