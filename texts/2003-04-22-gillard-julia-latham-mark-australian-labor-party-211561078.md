  Boat proves Government has no solutions 

  Recent unconfirmed reports of a boat carrying Vietnamese asylum seekers heading to  Australia has highlighted once again the failure of the Howard Government to conclude an  agreement with Indonesia on people smuggling. 

  A people smuggling agreement would ensure a strong working relationship between both  governments, enabling the sharing of accurate and timely information on people smuggling in  the region. As a further sign of the poor state of the bilateral relationship on this issue,  the Government has failed dismally in its efforts to persuade the Indonesian  Parliament that people smuggling should be made a crime under Indonesian law. 

  The situation also highlights the need for a Coastguard to protect our borders. Only Labor  will establish a Coastguard - a cop on the beat 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Labor  believes Coastguard - a truly effective maritime police - should carry out surveillance and  interception of any asylum seeker boats heading toward Australia. 

  The Howard Government has said that a Coastguard is not needed because there are no more  boats coming. They should now recognise the folly of that statement. 

  If boats start to arrive, what is Minister Ruddock planning to do with any asylum seekers?  Will they be subject to the ‘Pacific Solution’? Will they be placed in mainland detention?  We know that the Christmas Island centre is not an option due to contract bungling by the  Immigration Department. As a result, the contract is now being re-tendered and will be 

  overseen by the Finance Department. As to when the permanent centre will eventually be  built and what its capacity will be, who really knows? 

  Only Labor has a comprehensive policy to deal with asylum seekers and refugees -  Protecting Australia and Protecting the Australian Way. The Government’s plan on asylum  seekers is simply to engage in policy on the run.
