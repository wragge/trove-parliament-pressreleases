 XENOPHON: SCRAP  POLLIES’ PAY INCREASE   

 Independent Senator for South Australia Nick Xenophon has vowed to renew his push for greater  transparency in the way politicians’ pay is set, and to move to scrap the latest increase when  Parliament resumes next month. 

 “There is no such thing as a good time for a politicians’ pay rise, but this comes at an especially  bad time,” Nick said. “It’s just embarrassing.” 

 Senator Xenophon pointed to the massive increase in politicians’ pay earlier this year, which saw a  minimum $44,000 rise for a backbencher’s pay. 

 “Coming less than a week after the parliamentary paralysis in relation to asylum seekers, and only  a few days after the introduction of the carbon tax, this will only fuel public anger at politicians  generally,” Nick said. 

 “While the Remuneration Tribunal that sets politicians’ pay is independent of the Parliament, I’ll be  renewing my push to require the Tribunal to hold public hearings,” Nick said. “This would give key  interest and community groups, as well as the public, a chance to be heard. It would also give  pollies a chance to justify any change in pay. And until that transparency exists this pay rise needs  to be reversed.” 

 “When I moved an amendment for this in February this year, it was voted down by the Government  and Opposition. Only the Greens and DLP Senator John Madigan supported the need for greater  transparency.” 

 “Reform is inevitable, and the major parties need to work this out sooner rather than later.”
