 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 RUDDOCK’S FAILURE PUTS AUSTRALIANS AT RISK

 Yesterday, Minister Ruddock launched a kit and video entitled ‘Managing Migration’ which was nothing more than a shameless exercise in self-congratulation.

 Today, Australians learn that the Minister has nothing to be proud of.  As Minister, he has mismanaged the processing of asylum-seeker claims so fundamentally that on his own admission 700 Temporary Protection Visas (TPV) have been wrongly issued.

 To this, Minister Ruddock simply says that issues like checking identity and security “may have escaped our attention in the past”.

 No one should get a TPV unless their identity is known and they are security-cleared. Minister Ruddock has issued visas to Pakistanis pretending to be Afghans.  Even worse, a number of these TPV holders have suspected links to the Pakistani intelligence service, the ISI, an organisation that funded and nurtured the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.  Others are suspected of fighting alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan and others may have worked in militant Islamic schools recruiting for al Qaeda and the Taliban.

 The Minister should take responsibility for this massive processing and security failure and guarantee to the Australian people that all steps are now being taken to properly protect Australia from security risks and immigration identity fraud.
