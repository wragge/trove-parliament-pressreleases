 Biggest Boat Arrival Of The Year Intercepted 

 19/04/13 

 The latest illegal boat arrival, carrying 153 people, is the largest vessel to be intercepted this year,  following a month of record breaking numbers of arrivals being successfully smuggled across  Australia’s borders, Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Shadow Minister  for Justice Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said. 

 “There have already been more than double the amount of boat arrivals this April compared to last  year and we still have just under two weeks left of the month,” Mr Keenan said. 

 “When you have almost 1000 more people arriving by boat in the first 17 days of April compared to  the total arrivals for the same month last year, it is clear that the crisis at our borders is continually  deteriorating. 

 “You would think that the continual worsening of the situation would lead Labor to re-evaluate their  failed polices yet with every grim new milestone they reaffirm their determination to cling to failure. 

 “There is a way to break people smuggling but it requires the right policies and resolve to follow  them through. 

 “The arrival of a boat at Geraldton and the people smugglers twice daily ferry service is making a  mockery out of Australia’s border protection system. 

 “It is going to take a change in government, the reintroduction of tough border protection policies  and a strong resolve to restore Australia’s reputation for having a robust border protection system  and stopping the boats from coming,” Mr Keenan said.
