 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 2013 set to be another profitable year for the  people smugglers under Labor January 02, 2013

 The first day of a new year and already the illegal boats begin to arrive, with the latest boat, carrying 45 people, making it  almost all the way to the mainland before being intercepted, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection  Michael Keenan said.

 “The illegal vessel was intercepted just west of Darwin yesterday as our Border Protection Service is so overworked and  under resourced that it cannot keep up with their role as a daily water taxi service for the people smugglers,” Mr Keenan  said.

 “It is not acceptable to have illegal boats turning up on our mainland simply because the Government has failed to  adequately resource the frontline agencies tasked with protecting Australia’s borders.

 “This is just further evidence of how Labor’s budget cuts are hindering the ability of our Border Protection Command to  adequately do its job of protecting our borders.

 “Under the Gillard Government the people smugglers look set to continue their booming trade in 2013.

 “Clearly whilst Labor is still in office, 2013 is set to be another record breaking year for boat arrivals.

 “Only a Coalition Government will restore the full suite of Howard Government policies that squashed people smuggling  and put an end to this insidious trade,” Mr Keenan said.
