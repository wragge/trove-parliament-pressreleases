 Senator Andrew Bartlett   Leader of the Australian Democrats  Spokesperson for Immigration  11 February 2004                  MEDIA RELEASE                                   04/066                

 

 Nauru detention camp must close - Senate agrees   

 The Senate has supported a motion by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Andrew  Bartlett, calling for the detention centre on Nauru to be closed.   

 Senator Bartlett said no civilised country would maintain the situation faced by the asylum seekers.   

 “Over 260 people including more than 70 children, have been detained for well over 2 years on  Nauru,” said Senator Bartlett.   

 “These people may not fit the strict international definition of refugee but there is a strong and clear  humanitarian case that they cannot return to their countries of origin.   

 “People should not be kept in detention indefinitely when it is clearly unsafe for them to return  home.    

 “The Government’s policy on Nauru is drifting. The people there cannot return home and have  nowhere else to go.   

 “Australian taxpayers are paying to keep them locked up in remote isolation for the foreseeable  future.   

 “The Senate today agreed this is unacceptable,” said Senator Bartlett.   

 Senator Bartlett who has twice visited the Nauru camps has challenged the Immigration Minister  Senator Vanstone to visit the Nauru camps at least once to see the situation for herself.   

 “The Democrats welcome Labor’s support for closing down Nauru. We are willing to work with all  parties to get a humane solution for the people who are locked up on Nauru,” concluded Senator  Bartlett.
