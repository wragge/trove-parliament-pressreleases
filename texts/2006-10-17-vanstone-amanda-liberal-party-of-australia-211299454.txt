  Burke’s misinformation on SlEV X children a disgrace 

  “Tony Burke has stooped to a new low in his campaign to convince Labor to scrap  Temporary Protection Visas (TPVs.”) Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs,  Amanda Vanstone, said today. 

  “Not only is Mr Burke’s policy backflip putting the lives of asylum seekers at risk, he’s using  misinformation to win support for his case. 

  “Just raising the possibility of a Labor Government scrapping TPVs will encourage people  smugglers to recruit passengers and risk dangerous journeys to Australia in leaky boats  and through treacherous seas. 

  “TPVs, a key plank of Australia’s border protection measures, have been effective in  slowing to a trickle the flow of unauthorised boat arrivals. 

  “Our border protection policies have helped saved lives by deterring people smugglers. 

  “That’s allowed Australia to ensure more of its refugee places are taken by those already  assessed by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees as being in most  desperate need of resettlement. 

  “But Mr Burke doesn’t seem to care. His policy position will encourage people smugglers  and their potential clients to put their lives at risk. 

  “To push his argument along, he claimed yesterday that 146 children were on the SlEV X  ‘I.. .children who overwhelmingly had dads living in Australia.. ..” (see attached transcript  extract) 

  “Yet the report on the SlEV X, from a committee on which the Government had only three  of 8 members, found that there were 70 children on the vessel. ( see attached page from  report) 

  “Mr Burke’s misinformation and politicking demeans the tragedy for those who lost their  lives and will only serve to compound the grief for survivors and family and friends. 

  “Mr Burke should stick to the facts. If he can’t succeed in his ambition of convincing the  ALP to change policy on TPVs with the truth -that should tell him something. 

  “Under the Coalition, our policy is for orderly migration in cooperation with the UNHCR. 

  “Under Tony Burke, Labor policy would be to encourage people smugglers to come on  down.”

  through in that period actually did do something to  save lives, and which policies failed. 

  I received a report back to me that I had requested  some months ago, from the Social Policy 

  Committee of the Labor caucus. It reported on a  number of issues, but one of them was the issue of  temporary protection visas. 

  we get to change  it. And I'm sure that's something  PERTH SYDNEY ADELAIDE BRISBANE CANBERRA HOBART MELBOURNE  0883622323 0732592100 0261245200 0362242000 0393489191 0892285800 0293184000  % r a c y  for the benefit of

  The reason 146 children were on that boat -  children who overwhelmingly had dads living in  Australia, who'd been found and had been given  protection by Australia - the reason they went to a  1 people smuggler and found themselves on SIEV X, 

  was that their dad wasn't able to be reunited with  them. On a temporary visa, he was not able to  sponsor them to join him. On a temporary visa, he  was not allowed to leave to see them. 

  And we ended up with a situation of people giving  their life savings to evil operators, who then put  their lives at risk and in this case, many did drown. 

  On receiving that report, Labor's position on  temporary protection visas is enshrined in our  platform. It's not open to me to announce new  Labor policy. We deal with that in our April 

  conference, and whenever we have a lead-up to  conference, no doubt we then end up in endless  resolutions in the Senate, which we have to vote on,  which are framed in terms of current policy before

  The Sinking of SIEV X: Intelligence and  Surveillance 

  Introduction  8.1 In the early hours (approximately 1.30am ‘Golf or local time) of 18 October 

  Bandar Lampung in south 421 passengers and crew, including 70 children,  200 1, a vessel under the pay of alleged people smuggler, Abu Qussey,’ departed from  were on board. Ten people had refused to embark due to the boat’s size. Media  reports, based on passenger accounts, claim that the remainder were forced at gun  point by Indonesian officials to board the ~ e s s e l . ~

  8.2 Before heading to Christmas Island, the vessel stopped near the Karakatau  group of islands where 24 passengers disembarked due to concerns about the SIEV’s  seaworthiness. 397 passengers and crew remained onboard. 

  8.3 At about noon on 19 October 2001, the engines on the vessel stalled. By about  2.00pm (GT) the vessel began to take on water out of the sight of land, a situation that  deteriorated an hour later when it began to take ‘heavy water, listed violently to the  side, capsized and sank within an hour’.4 120 people are estimated to have been in the  water after the boat sank; none of the 70 life jackets worked. 

  8.4 Around noon on 20 October, after close to twenty hours in the water, two  fishing boats picked up the survivors. The notes for the People Smuggling Taskforce  state: 

  4 1 adults and 3 children survived, 352 drowned. Survivors taken to Jakarta -  being cared for by 10M [International Migration Organisation] at Bogor 

  1 There are various spellings of Qussey in the intelligence material. Some use ‘Quassey’ (ADF 

  intelligence review), others ‘Qussay’ (DIMA Intelligence Notes). Hansard follows Rear  Admiral Smith’s use of Qussey. Unless citing inaterial, the Committee einploys this version in  the report. 

  Except where otherwise noted, the account of SIEV X’s passage and sinking is based on the  following: ‘SIEV X Chronology’, Attachment A in the declassified suininary of the Defence  review of SIEV X intelligence, Minister of Defence to CMI, undated, received 4 July 2002; and  PST Notes, ‘People Smuggling Taskforce - High Level Group Meeting, 3.15 pm., Tuesday 2.3  October 200 1 ’, p.2.
