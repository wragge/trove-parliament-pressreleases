 THE HON DR SHARMAN STONE MP   

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship

 Labor’s desperate measure to cope with the exploding surge on Christmas Island   

 The Rudd Labor Government has been forced to ship in portables at the Christmas Island detention  centre in a desperate measure to cope with the exploding surge of unauthorised arrivals.   

 The Government has been forced to admit that it is moving 24 new portables to the refugee  processing outpost to house an extra 88 asylum seekers, at a cost of $1.5 million, Dr Sharman Stone,  Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, said today.     

 The Government continues to reap the consequences of its softening of immigration policy since  August 2008. This is when the people smugglers moved back into business.   

 Labor needs to concede that it has lost the battle against people smugglers and must now urgently  address its policy failures. 

 Last year, Labor MP Michael Danby, Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Immigration, claimed  the Christmas Island detention centre was “an enormous white elephant.” 

 It now seems this white elephant is about to grow legs. 

 People smugglers had been the only winners from the stripping away of strong immigration controls. 

 Rather than simply bring in the portables, Mr Rudd and Senator Evans should acknowledge the pull  factors they have created which has led to the renewed big business in people smuggling into  Australia. 

 The Government must launch an independent inquiry into the relationship between its softened  stance on immigration management and the surge of people smuggled into Australia over the last 12  months. 

 Since September 2008 there have been 27 boats carrying more than 1200 unauthorised arrivals. 

 Clearly, with the latest boats arriving carrying at least 70 people on board, the biggest business on  Christmas Island will soon be the erection of portables. This is no way to protect the lives of asylum  seekers pushed off the beaches in Indonesia and it is no way to stop the people smugglers.
