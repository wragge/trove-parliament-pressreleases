 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Thursday, 28 March 2013   

 

 Forcing families into poverty on bridging  visas will harm, not help   

 The Australian Greens today said that forcing families onto bridging visas with no  support or right to work is just the next step in the Labor Party's race to the bottom with  Tony Abbott.    

 “It’s disappointing to see how low the Labor Party is willing to go in this race to the  bottom against Tony Abbott,” said the Australian Greens’ spokesperson for immigration  and citizenship, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.   

 “On any measure, the government's policy of offshore detention and no advantage is not  working.   

 “It is not stopping the boats, it is not stopping boat tragedies and it is only inflicting  further harm on vulnerable refugees, including children.   

 “If families are put onto bridging visas without the right to work and support themselves  then the results will be disastrous.   

 “Entire families, including vulnerable children, will be forced to live in destitution and no  government should be willing to do that.   

 “We have a responsibility to offer protection to refugees, not to inflict further harm.
