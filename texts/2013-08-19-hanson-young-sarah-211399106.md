 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Monday, 19 August 2013   

 Voters say no to women and children on  Nauru and Manus Island   

 Polling released today has shown that the majority of Australians don’t support the  cruelty of the old parties’ policies that will see women and children sent to Manus Island  and Nauru, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “This shows that Australians don’t want Labor’s cruel refugee policy to be carried out in  their names,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young  said.   

 “Australians believe in the fair-go, but Labor’s plan to send refugee children and mothers  to tent-slums on Pacific islands directly contradicts that.   

 “The poll shows that it is the young people of Australia who are most disappointed by the  old parties’ race to the bottom and obsession with cruelty.   

 “Many long-time Labor voters have told me that they feel very let down by the party’s  lurch to the right on refugee cruelty.   

 “The Greens are standing up as a strong voice for vulnerable refugees and for the  majority of Australians who don’t want to see this cruelty carried out with their vote.”   

 

 Over 7,500 Australians have already signed up to the NotWithMyVote.com.au campaign,  sending a clear message to the old parties that their cruel policies are not being done in  their names.
