 Sarah Hanson-Young   Don't Leave Desperate Asylum Seekers Circling  The Ocean, Mr Rudd  Media Release | Spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young

 The Federal Government has a duty to the 78 asylum seekers aboard the Oceanic Viking to stop dithering and 

 bring them to Australia for speedy processing of their claims, according to Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young. 

 Senator Hanson-Young, Greens spokesperson for Immigration and Human Rights, says Customs officials had no 

 answers at Estimates last night when asked what danger lay in bringing the asylum seekers on a government boat 

 to Aust



 ralia. 

 "There is clear confusion about whether Indonesia has accepted these asylum seekers,'' Senator Hanson-Young 

 said. 

 "In any case they are on an Australian ship in international waters. 

 "The Viking is not steaming towards an Indonesian port, in fact it is doing laps of the Indian Ocean while the 

 asylum seekers wait for someone, anyone, to make a decision.'' 

 "The simplest thing is for Australia to take them here for processing.'' 

 Today the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, meets his Indonesian counterpart in Jakarta.  

 The Greens urge Mr Rudd to ensure his talks are not limited to simply pushing the burden of dealing asylum 

 seekers onto our regional neighbours. 

 "We need to actually come up with a better solution - not the Pacific solution, not the Indian solution, not the 

 Indonesian solution,'' Senator Hanson-Young said. 

 "We actually need a better program of working with countries in the region including ensuring that wherever 

 people arrive and seek asylum, that their rights are upheld.'' 

 More than 3000 children who have sought asylum in Malaysia are being arbitrarily detained in that country - which 

 like Indonesia is not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention. In Australia, this would not have happened. 

 "This is highly relevant since we know that there are five children on board the Viking right now,'' Senator 

 Hanson-Young said. 

 "The question for Mr Rudd is, how will those children's rights be upheld if they are taken to Indonesia for 

 processing?''
