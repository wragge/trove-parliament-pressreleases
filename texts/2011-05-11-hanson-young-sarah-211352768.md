 Senate condemns Malaysian asylum seeker deal   

 A Greens’ motion urging the Senate to condemn the Australian Government’s deal to send 800  asylum seekers to Malaysia has been passed by senators this afternoon, after the Coalition supported  it. 

 The motion also calls on the Gillard government to immediately abandon the proposal. 

  “The Prime Minister keeps saying she won’t bring her measures to parliament, and will instead rely  on the Tampa legislation of the Howard years,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Sen. Sarah  Hanson-Young, said. 

 “The Senate has today given her a clear signal that it does not support her plan. 

 “The Greens again call on the government to release the legal advice and outline the role the  Malaysian government will play in this human swap plan. 

 “Despite all the speeches Ms Gillard and other Labor MPs made while in opposition to condemn the  former Howard government’s treatment of asylum seekers, the Prime Minister has shown she and her  government’s policies to be no different to the Coalition’s. 

 “The Senate has today called on the Gillard government to abandon its Malaysian plan, as have  numerous human rights groups in Australia and overseas. 

 “There are grave concerns for the safety and well-being of those 800 asylum seekers will be exploited  in this political fix, if the plan proceeds. 

 “With the memorandum of understanding between the Australian and Malaysian governments not yet  signed, there is still time to scrap the proposal.”
