  CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY 

  BANKING WITH THE POOR 

  THIRD ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL WORKSHOP 

  BRISBANE 21-25 NOVEMBER 1994 

  FORMAL OPENING AND KEYNOTE ADDRESS 

  BY THE "ON GORDON BILNEY MP 

  MINISTER FOR DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION 

  AND PACIFIC ISLAND AFFAIRS 

  INTRODUCTION 

  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 

  I HAVE THE HONOUR THIS MORNING TO OPEN THE TI-llRD ASIA-PACIFIC 

  REGIONAL WORKSHOP ON BANKING WITH THE POOR. 

  FIRSTLY, I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A WARM WELCOME TO THE MANY 

  OVERSEAS VISITORS AND TRUST YOUR STAY HERE WILL BE BOTH A 

  PRODUCTIVE AND ENJOYABLE ONE. I AM SURE ALL OF US WILL BENEFIT 

  GREATL Y FROM THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MIX WITH FELLOW RESEARCHERS 

  AND PRACTITIONERS IN THE FIELD OF MICRO-CREDIT. DURING TIIIS WEEK 

  OF SHARING AND EXCHANGING IDEAS, I HOPE THAT WE CAN ADD TO THE 

  INNOV A TIVE METHODS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED TO 

  ASSIST THE POOR, BOTH IN OUR REGION AND AROUND THE WORLD. 

  I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE THE FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPMENT 

  COOPERATION FOR ITS CAMPAIGN OF ADVOCACY FOR BANKING WITH THE 

  POOR . TI-llS WORK HAS SHOWN THAT WlllLE THE POOR ARE DEFINITELY 

  CREDIT WORTHY, THEY FACE MANY OBSTACLES IN GAINING ACCESS TO 

  THE MOST BASIC OF CREDIT AND ASSOCIATED BANKING SERVICES. 

  THE TWO PREVIOUS REGIONAL WORKSHOPS ON BANKING WITH TIIE 

  POOR., THE FIRST IN MANILA IN 1991 AND TIIE SECOND IN KUALA LUMPUR 

  IN 1992, WERE UNIQUE FORUMS IN BRINGING TOGETIIER TIIE 

  COMMERCIAL BANKS AND NGOS TO EXPLORE AVENUES TO MAKE CREDIT  A V AlLABLE TO TIIE POOREST OF TIlE POOR AND PROVIDE TIIEM WITH A  REAL OPPORTIJNITY TO HELP TIlEMSELVES. IMPORTANTL Y, BANKING  WITH THE POOR HAS SHOWN THAT THIS ASSISTANCE CAN BE PROVIDED 

  ON FULLY COMMERCIAL TERMS. 

  TIlE FOUNDATION HAS DEMONSTRATED TIlE IMPORTANCE OF 

  ESTABLISHING SOUND COMMERCIAL LINKAGES BETWEEN TIIE FORMAL  FINANCIAL SECTOR AND THE NGOS AND COtvlMUNITY GROUPS. TIIESE  LINKAGES ARE ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL IF THE POOREST OF TIIE POOR ARE  TO HAVE ACCESS TO FUNDS FROM COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL 

  INSTITUTIONS. 

  I COMMEND THE FOUNDATION IN PURSUING THIS PATH-BREAKING WORK  AND IN ENCOURAGING THE COMMERCIAL BANKING SECTOR TO VIEW 

  NGOS AND SELF-HELP GROUPS AS SOUND INVESTMENTS. TIIE 

  FOUNDATION'S ONGOING ROLE IN ORGANISING NATIONAL WORKSHOPS  ON BANKING WITH TIIE POOR IN SEVEN ASIAN COUNTRIES HAS HELPED TO  SUSTAIN A PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN BANKS AND NGOS. I AM  PARTICULARL Y PLEASED TO WELCOME THE REPRESENTATIVES HERE  TODA Y FROM THE COMMERCIAL BANKING SECTOR. 

  MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT ON THE INTERNATIONAL AGENDA 

  I BELIEVE THERE IS AN INCREASING INTEREST INTERNA TIONALL Y IN THE  STRATEGIES USED TO DEVELOP SMALL ENTERPRISES. FLOURISHING  . INFORMAL BUSINESSES HAVE LONG EXlSTED IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,  PROVIDING EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. JOB 

  CREATION IS ONE OF THE MAIN CHALLENGES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES  AND IT IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNISED THAT THE MAJORITY OF TIIESE  JOBS WILL NEED TO COME FROM THE INFORMAL SECTOR. MICRO "

  ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT IS NOW FIRML Y PLACED ON THE 

  INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENDA. 

  FOR EXAMPLE, THE WORLD BANK HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES  AIMED AT PROMOTING MICROâ‘CREDIT. 1i-IE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK  IS ALSO INCREASINGLY DIRECTING FUNDS SPECIFICALLY TO MICROâ‘ 

  CREDIT INITIATIVES. RECENTL Y IT APPROVED US$23 MILLION FOR A  MICROâ‘CREDIT PROJECT IN INDONESIA. ALSO, IN THE LEAD UP TO THE  WORLD SUMMIT FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, MICROâ‘ ENTERPRISE  DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD AS AN EFFECTIVE  MEANS OF ALLEVIATING POVERTY AND CREATING EMPLOYMENT THESE 

  ARE TWO OF THE KEY THEMES OF THE SUMMIT. 

  MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT AND POVERTY REDUCTION 

  ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS INCREASED INTEREST IS, I BELIEVE, THE  IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT,  INCLUDING MICROâ‘CREDIT SCHEMES, CAN MAKE TOWARDS THE PRIMARY  GOAL OF DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS THE ELIMINATION OF POVERTY. WITH  OVER 1.3 BILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN ABSOLUTE POVERTY, ACCESS TO 

  CREDIT AND ASSOCIATED SERVICES REPRESENTS A REAL OPPORTIJNITY  FOR PEOPLE TO HELP THEMSELVES TO ACHIEVE LASTING IMPROVEMENTS  TO THEIR LIVING STANDARDS. 

  LET ME SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS 

  APPROACH TO POVERTY REDUCTION, AND THE ROLE OF MICRO "

  ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT. 

  THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGE OF TACKLING POVERTY WAS BROUGHT  HOME TO ME DURING MY RECENT TRIP TO RWANDA WHERE I CAME FACE 

  TO FACE WITH THE REALITY OF PEOPLES' DAILY STRUGGLE FOR PHYSICAL  SURVIV AL. THIS EXPERIENCE WAS IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE REALITY  HERE IN AUSTRALIA, WHERE MOST OF US LIVE IN A COMFORTABLE AND  SECURE ENVIRONMENT. 

  AUSTRALIA RECOGNISES THAT THE CHALLENGE OF REDUCING POVERTY  IN THE LONGâ‘ TERM REQUIRES A COMBINATION OF MEASURES AIMED AT  SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WIDCH IS BOTH SUSTAINABLE 

  a387 

  AND EQUITABLE. ECONOMIC GROWTH IS AN ESSENTIAL ENABLING FORCE 

  FOR DEVELOPMENT, EXPANDING THE RANGE OF OPTIONS A V AILABLE TO 

  BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND NA nONS. GROwrn IS NEEDED TO GENERATE 

  THE RESOURCES WInCH ALLOW PEOPLE TO ENJOY A REASONABLE 

  STANDARD OF LIVING. 

  HOWEVER, ECONOMIC GROWTH OF ITSELF DOES NOT NECESSARILY LEAD 

  TO IMPROVEMENTS IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. MEASURES TO PROMOTE 

  ECONOMIC GROwrn MUST BE COMPLEMENTED BY INVESTMENTS IN 

  HUMAN RESOURCES THROUGH EDUCATION, HEALTH AND CAPACITY 

  BUILDING. SUCH INVESTMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR EQUITY. 

  MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF 

  EFFORTS TO PROMOTE BROAD BASED GROWTH. IT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO 

  ECONOMIC GROwrn BY TAPPING A VAST AND UNDER-UTILISED POOL OF 

  PRODUCTIVE SKILLS AND RESOURCES, WInLE ALSO INCREASING THE 

  INCOMES OF THE POOR DIRECTLY. THROUGH EARNING EXTRA INCOME, 

  THE POOR CAN AFFORD BETTER NUTRITION AND HOUSING, HEALTH CARE 

  AND EDUCATION FOR THEIR CHILDREN. 

  MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT CAN BE PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN 

  INCREASING WOMEN'S STATUS AND INCOME. BY PROVIDING WOMEN 

  WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN INCOME-GENERATING 

  ACTIVITIES, THEY ARE ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR EDUCATION, HEALTH, 

  LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIONS WITH CONSEQUENT WIDER BENEFITS 

  FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. WOMEN HAVE 

  PROVEN ENTREPRENEURIAL TALENTS AND "BANKABILITY", WInCH HAVE 

  BEEN KEY FACTORS IN THE SUCCESS OF MANY MICRO-CREDIT SCHEMES. 

  WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION, AND THE PARTICIPATION OF COMMUNITIES IN 

  GENERAL, IS ABSOLUTELY BASIC TO THE SUCCESS OF MICRO-ENTERPRISE 

  PROGRAMS. COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN THE DESIGN AND 

  IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECTS IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE SUST AINABILITY 

  OF THEIR ACTIVITIES. IN A BROADER SENSE, SUCH PARTICIPATION IS. 

  ALSO ESSENTIAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STRONG CIVIL SOCIETY, 

  WHERE PEOPLE HAVE THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC POWER TO HAVE A SAY 

  IN THE FUTURE OF THEIR COUNTRY. 

  MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT AND AUSTRALIA'S AID PROGRAM 

  TO REINFORCE THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF MICRO-ENTERPRISE 

  DEVELOPMENT IN AUSTRALIA'S AID PROGRAM, I WAS PLEASED TO 

  ANNOUNCE AN INCREASED COMMITMENT TO MICRO-ENTERPRISE 

  PROJECTS IN THE 1994/95 BUDGET . THIS NEW INITIATIVE, VALUED AT $1.3 

  MILLION OVER TWO YEARS, WIL PILOT NEW ACTIVITIES IN THE SOUTH 

  PACIFIC AND SOUTH EAST ASIA DURING 1994/95 AND 1995/96. 

  WORK HAS BEGUN ON PROJECTS TO BE FINANCED UNDER THE NEW 

  INITIA TIVE. IN THAILAND, A MICRO-ENTERPRISE PROJECT HAS 

  COMMENCED INVOLVING A BANGKOK NGO AND THE AUSTRALIAN BASED 

  OPPORTUNITY FOUNDATION (pREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS THE MARANA THA 

  TRUSn. THE PROJECT WILL ASSIST IN THE ESTABLISHMENT AND 

  TRAINING OF AN INDIGENOUS SPECIALIST NGO TO DELIVER CREDIT, 

  TRAINING AND OTHER SERVICES TO THE POOR LIVING IN SLUM AREAS OF 

  BANGKOK . 

  THE GOVERNMENT OF LAOS HAS ALSO INDICATED INTEREST IN MICRO "

  ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. POSSIBLE PROJECTS ARE NOW 

  BEING DISCUSSED WITH THE LOCAL PLANNING AGENCY AND NGOS . 

  CONSULTATIONS ARE ALSO UNDERWAY WITH SOUTH PACIFIC CREDIT 

  UNIONS AND THE AUSTRALIAN EXECUTIVE SERVICE OVERSEAS PROGRAM 

  TO IMPLEMENT TIffi SOUTH PACIFIC COMPONENT OF TIffi MICRO "

  ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE. THIS COMPONENT WILL PROVIDE 

  TRAINING FOR SMALL-SCALE ENTREPRENEURS IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC 

  REGION TO ASSIST THEM TO ACCESS FINANCIAL SERVICES AND CREDIT. 

  TO EXPAND THE RANGE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THE 

  REGION, ASSISTANCE WILL ALSO BE PROVIDED TO THE CREDIT UNION 

  MOVEMENT IN THE FORM OF RESEARCH AND PRACTICAL TRAINING 

  ATIACHMENTS. 

  ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE EXPERIENCE IN SMALL ENTERPRISE 

  DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN IN ASIA, SPECIAL CONSIDERATION NEEDS TO BE  GIVEN TO TIIE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA AND  TIIE ISLAND COUNTRIES OF TIIE SOUTH PACIFIC. DEVELOPMENT OF A  VIBRANT PRIVATE SECTOR - INCLUDING SMALL ENTERPRISES - WILL BE  CRUCIAL TO TIIE ABILITY OF PNG AND THE PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES 

  TO GENERATE SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWfH. 

  HOWEVER, STIMULATING MICRO-ENTERPRISE ACTIVlTY fN TIIE PACIFIC 

  PRESENTS SOME fNTERESTING CHALLENGES. IN MOST CASES THESE  COUNTRIES DO NOT HAVE THE STRONG fNTERNAL MARKETS, HUMAN AND  PHYSICAL RESOURCES, AND ENTREPRENEURIAL TRADITION WHICH HAVE  HELPED TO FUEL THE VIBRANT INFORMAL SECTOR THAT IS FOUND IN 

  ASIA AND ELSEWHERE. TIIE PACIFIC MAY NEED THE DEVELOPMENT OF 

  UNIQUE APPROACHES IF TIIE POTENTIAL OF MICRO-ENTERPRISE IS TO BE  REALISED. I AM PLEASED TO SEE TIIESE ISSUES WILL BE EXPLORED IN  WORKSHOPS THIS WEEK AND I PARTICULARLY LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR  FINDINGS IN THIS AREA. 

  I SHOULD ADD THAT TIIE $1.3 MILLION TWO-YEAR MICRO-ENTERPRISE  DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE IS ONLY A SMALL COMPONENT OF TIIE TOTAL  MICRO-ENTERPRISE ACTIVITY IN THE AUSTRALIAN AID PROGRAM.  AUSTRALIA HAS FUNDED MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN  A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES OVER A PERIOD OF MANY YEARS. IN FACT, 

  OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS AUSTRALIA WILL CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN  S14 MILLION TO MICRO-ENTERPRISE ACTIVITIES. 

  ONE OF THE LARGEST PROGRAMS THAT HAS FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING 

  MICRO-ENTERPRISES IS THE PHILIPPINES / AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY  ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, OR PACAP. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES 

  ASSISTANCE FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA TO NGOS IN THE 

  PHILIPPINES. THE GRANT ASSISTANCE IS FOR COMMUNITY-BASED  DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AIMED AT RAISING THE LIVING STANDARDS OF  THE POOR AND THE MARGINALISED. 

  SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 1986, PACAP HAS GROWN IN SIZE, IMPACT AND 

  ORGANISATIONAL CAPACITY. TO DATE, PACAP HAS FUNDED 381 

  PROJECTS FOR A TOTAL VALUE OF JUST UNDER $12 MILLION. CURRENTLY  THERE ARE 115 ONGOING PROJECTS. AROUND HALF OF THESE INVOLVE  SMALL SCALE LOAN ACTIVITIES. A RECENT REVIEW OF PACAP FOUND  THAT IT HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN IMPROVING THE INCOME 

  EARNING CAPACITY AND LIVING STANDARDS OF THE POOR. 

  IN ADDITION TO PACAP, THE PHILIPPINES AUSTRALIA NGO PROGRAM, OR 

  .PANGOP, PROVIDES GRANTS FOR SELECTED â‘ PROJECTS INITIATED BY  AUSTRALIAN NGOS WITH PHILIPPINE NGO PARTNERS. IN THE FIRST TWO  YEARS OF PANGOP'S OPERATION, FUNDING OF $2.6 MILLION HAS BEEN â‘  APPROVED FOR SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. I HAVE 

  RECENTL Y APPROVED TIlREE NEW PANGOP PROJECTS, EACH OF WlllCH  HAS A COMMUNITY CREDIT AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT FOCUS . 

  IN VIETNAM, AUSTRALIA IS SUPPORTING THROUGH UNICEF THE 

  DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL SCALE ENTERPRISES FOR RURAL WOMEN. TIllS  PROJECT INVOLVES TRAINING IN MICRO-ENTERPRISE MANAGEMENT AND  THE OPERATION OF CREDIT FACILITIES. ANOTHER GRANT WilL SUPPORT  THE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT AGENCY, AN AUSTRALIAN 

  NGO, IN IMPLEMENTING THE VIETNAM WOMEN'S UNION FOOD 

  PRODUCTION PROGRAM. THIS PROJECT INVOLVES THE MANUFACTURE OF  HERBAL MEDICINES AND IMPROVEMENT IN CROP PRODUCTION TI-IROUGH 

  TRAINING AND CREDIT FACILITIES 

  IN CAMBODIA, AUSTRALIA IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE CAMBODIA 

  RESETILEMENT AND REINTEGRATION PROGRAM, IMPLEMENTED BY THE  UNITED NA TrONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME. THE PROGRAM WILL 

  SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF HANDICRAFT ENfERPRISES AND ASSIST  IN MARKETING. THE PROJECT IS ALSO SEEKING TO REVITALISE THE 

  LOCAL SILK INDUSTRY. THE OVERALL AIM OF THIS PROJECT IS TO 

  PROVIDE INCOME-EARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITIES WHO  HAVE RECENTLY ABSORBED, FOLLOWING YEARS OF WAR, RETURNING  CAMBODIAN REFUGEES AND INTERNALLY DISPLACED CAMBODIANS. 

  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AUSTRALIAN NGOS WHICH ARE SUCCESSFULLY  DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING MICRO-CREDIT AND MICRO-ENTERPRISE  ACTIVITIES . A NUMBER OF THEM HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED GOOD  INTERNATIONAL REPUTATIONS. I BELIEVE THERE IS SCOPE FOR 

  AUSTRALIAN NGOS TO BECOME MORE INVOLVED IN TIllS AREA . 

  WE ARE ALSO FORTUNATE TO HAVE A NUMBER OF AUSTRALIAN 

  RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS WHICH ARE ASSISTING THE EXPANSION OF  MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT. 

  THE IMPORTANT WORK OF AUSTRALIAN ACADEMICS SUCH AS: DR JOE 

  REMENYI, INCLUDING HIS BOOK "WHERE CREDIT IS DUE"; THE ENTERPRISE  DEVELOPMENT COURSES OFFERED BY THE SOUTHERN CROSS UNIVERSITY  UNDER PROFESSOR PHILIP NECK; THE RESEARCH AND APPRAISAL WORK  BY THE NATIONAL CENTRE FOR DEVELOPMENT STUDIES AT THE ANU -

  AND SPECIFICALLY ALEX AGAFONOFF - TO MENTION ONLY A FEW -

  PROVIDE A SOLID BASE FOR TIllS EXPANSION. 

  FOR ITS PART , AIDAB, THE AUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT  ASSISTANCE BUREAU, IS EXPLORING AVENUES THAT ENCOURAGE THE  EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND SHARING OF EXPERIENCES BETWEEN  MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS. AIDAB IS ALSO 

  CONDUCTING A NUMBER OF IN-HOUSE SEMINARS AND TRAINING COURSES  TO ENSURE THAT OFFICERS ARE KEPT UP-TO-DATE WITH CURRENT IDEAS 

  AND OPTIONS ON MICRO-CREDIT AND MICRO-ENTERPRISE ACTIVITIES . 

  FUTURE CHALLENGES 

  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THAT LIE AHEAD FOR DONORS  AND PRACTITIONERS ALIKE IN DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING MICRO "

  ENTERPRISE ACTIVITIES. WHILE I CERT AINL Y BELIEVE THAT MICRO " ENTERPRISES HAVE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC AND  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, I ALSO RECOGNISE THAT WE CANNOT BECOME  TOO FOCUSED ON SMALL-SCALE PROJECT ACTIVITIES AND IONORE THE 

  BROADER ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE SMALL ENTERPRISES MUST 

  OPERATE. 

  MICRO-ENTERPRISES REQUIRE FERTILE SOIL IF TIIEY ARE TO FLOURISH. 

  INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUClURE , SUCH AS RURAL FEEDER ROADS AND 

  PUBLIC MARKET PLACES, IS IMPORTANT. ASSISTANCE Wl-llCH ENABLES 

  EXISTING FINANCIAL INSTIlUTIONS TO EXTEND TIIEIR REACH TO 

  INCLUDE SUPPORT TO MICRO-ENTERPRISES IS ALSO A VERY PRODUCTIVE 

  AVENUE TO EXPLORE. OF COURSE, CONCENTRA TION ON INDIRECT 

  SUPPORT NEED NOT PRECLUDE DIRECT SUPPORT - THERE IS SCOPE FOR 

  BOTH. 

  Wl-llLE THE SECTOR IS IMPORTANT, AND HOLDS GREAT POTENTIAL, IT IS 

  NOT THE PANACEA FOR ALL DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS IT IS ONLY ONE OF 

  MANY DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES . MORE PARTICULARLY, WE NEED TO BE 

  REALISTIC IN ASSESSING JUST WHAT ROLE EXTERNAL AID CAN PLAY IN 

  ASSISTING THE SECTOR. DONORS NEED TO BE CAREFUL THAT IN THEIR 

  ENTHUSIASM FOR MICRO-CREDIT THEY DO NOT PROVIDE ASSISTANCE IN 

  A WAY Wl-llCH UNDERMINES THE LONG-TERM VIABILITY OF THESE 

  ACTIVITIES. 

  I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE WORK THAT THE FOUNDATION HAS PUT INTO 

  THE "BEST PRACTICE" DOCUMENT CIRCULATED FOR TIllS MEETING. THIS 

  IS TO BE THE BASIS OF THE DISCUSSIONS IN THE COMING WEEK. I LOOK 

  FORWARD TO THE RESULTS OF THESE DISCUSSIONS AS THEY WILL 

  PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT INPUT INTO AUSTRALIA'S WORK. 

  IN PARTICULAR THESE PRINCIPLES FOCUS ON CRITICAL ISSUES SUCH AS: 

   " THE IMPORTANCE OF SAVINGS AS A DEMONSTRATION OF FINANCIAL 

  DISCIPLINE IN SEEKING TO ATTRACT LOAN FUNDS FROM THE FORMAL 

  FINANCIAL SECTOR, 

   " THE IMPORTANCE OF CHARGING MARKET INTEREST RATES TO ENSURE 

  SUST AINABILITY OF PROJECTS, AND 

   " THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF NGOS IN PROVIDING INSTITUTIONAL 

  SUPPORT AND ADVICE TO SELF-HELP GROUPS. 

  WHILE EARLIER DONOR EXPERIENCE WITH CREDIT PROGRAMS HAS BEEN  THORNY, TECHNIQUES FOR PROVIDrNG CREDIT TO THE POOR HAVE 

  IMPROVED DRAMA TICALL Y IN THE LAST DECADE. THE BANKING WITH  THE POOR PROGRAM HAS CONSISTENTLY ARGUED THAT LACK OF ACCESS  TO CREDIT, PROVIDED IN A TIMELY FASHION AND AT COMMERCIAL RATES 

  OF rNTEREST, IS A CRUCIAL CONSTRAINT UPON THE CAPACITY OF THE 

  WORKING POOR TO HELp â‘â‘ THEMSELVES THROUGH INFORMAL SECTOR  rNCOME-GENERATING ACTIVITIES . rN PARTICULAR, BANKING WITH THE  POOR GIVES EMPHASIS TO DOMESTIC FrNANCIAL DEVELOPMENT BY 

  MEANS OF LINKAGES BETWEEN SELF HELP GROUPS OF THE POOR AND 

  COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL INSTITIITIONS, WITH NGOS PERFORMING A  RANGE OF INTERMEDIARY FUNCTIONS. 

  THE FOUNDATION'S REPORT "TRANSACTION COSTS OF LENDrNG TO THE  RURAL POOR", PUBLISHED FOR THIS WORKSHOP, IS ANOTHER VALUABLE  ADDITION TO THE RESEARCH ON MICRO-CREDIT . 

  NEVERTHELESS, THE QUESTION OF WHETHER CREDIT IS THE MAJOR  LIMITING CONSTRAINT ON THE ABILITY OF THE POOR TO ENGAGE rN 

  rNCOME GENERATING ENTERPRISES IS FAR FROM SETILED. THIS IS WHY  THE AUSTRALIAN AID PROGRAM PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR A BROAD 

  RANGE OF ACTIVITIES WHICH INVOLVE CREDIT AS WELL AS MICRO "

  ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT. SUCH ACTIVITIES INVOLVE TRAINING rN  BASIC BUSINESS AND MARKETING SKILLS, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT  PROGRAMS AND INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING OF LOCAL 

  ORGANISATIONS. OBVIOUSLY, MICRO-CREDIT IS A MAJOR COMPONENT rN  MANY OF THESE MICRO-ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. 

  CLEARL Y THERE IS NO ONE CORRECT MODEL FOR PROVIDING ASSISTANCE  TO THE SECTOR. HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE STRONG AND COMMON PRE "

  REQUISITE -THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS MUST BE ADAPTED  TO THE LOCAL SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC REALITIES OF THE 

  ~ _ .... _. . .. -. .... ---'-.-

  COUNTRY , AND BE BASED ON LOCAL NEEDS EXPRESSED BY THE PEOPLE  THEMSEL VES . 

  CLOSING 

  FINALL Y I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON WHY I AM SO POSITIVE 

  REGARDING THE POTENTIAL OF THIS WORKSHOP SERIES . THE 

  FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION HAS RECOGNISED TIIA T  THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL POOL OF KNOWLEDGE ON MICRO-CREDIT  ACTIVITIES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND IN FACT, WE DONORS HAVE  ARRIVED VERY LATE ON THE SCENE. IN BRINGING TOGETHER THIS BODY 

  OF PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE, I AM SURE DONORS STAND TO LEARN A LOT 

  OVER THE REMAINDER OF THIS WEEK. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS KIND OF  DIALOGUE CANNOT BE UNDERESTIMATED . 

  I HOPE I HAVE LEFT YOU IN NO DOUBT THAT AUSTRALIA IS COMMIITED  TO SUPPORTING MICRO-CREDIT AND MICRO-ENTERPRISES THROUGH THE 

  DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION PROGRAM. THE OUTCOMES OF THIS 

  CONFERENCE WILL HELP ALL DONORS TO IMPROVE TIlEIR EFFORTS IN  TIIIS AREA. -

  I AM PLEASED TO OFFICIALL Y OPEN THE FOUNDATION FOR 

  DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION'S TIIIRD ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONAL  WORKSHOP ON BANKING WITH THE POOR AND WISH YOU ALL THE BEST 

  WITH YOUR ENDEAVOURS IN TIIIS IMPORTANT AREA OF DEVELOPMENT.
