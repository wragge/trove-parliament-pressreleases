 Six weeks in and ALP backbone fails to materialise

 The Australian Democrats have slammed Labor Leader Kevin Rudd's latest attempt to avoid being  wedged as a reflection of the lack of substance in the ALP's policies.   

 "Kevin Rudd has shunned fairness and compassion by vowing to continue the Howard Government's  abhorrent asylum seeker practices, its flawed and ideological intervention in the Northern Territory and  by refusing to endorse a Bill of Rights," Democrats' Attorney-General's spokesperson Senator Natasha  Stott Despoja said.    

 "The PM's reconciliation referendum received bipartisan support six weeks ago, now Mr Rudd has back-flipped and refused to commit to any meaningful reconciliation in his first term, or at all.   

 "Mr Rudd also refused to make any firm commitment to a human rights dialogue, instead prevaricating  with yet another lukewarm promise to 'consult' the community and declared that the republic was not a  priority.   

 "Obviously our national identity means nothing to the Labor Party.    

 "A true alternative government would not be scared to provide a new direction for our nation that reflects  our generational change.   

 "While Mr Rudd's self-declared conservatism may prefer otherwise, these are the issues that matter to  many voters.   

 "This should serve as a warning to voters that once in power, the will be little difference between the  incumbent and the alternative should Labor succeed in the polling booth.   

 "This just reinforces the need for independent, courageous and compassionate voices like the  Democrats in the Senate to hold the major parties to account on matters of substance," Senator Stott  Despoja said.
