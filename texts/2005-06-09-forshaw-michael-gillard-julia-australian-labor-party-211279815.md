 Senator Michael Forshaw  Senator for New South Wales  Speaking on Behalf of   JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Health   SAVE-Australia SEMINAR  “Policy, Politics and Other Aspects of Mental Health and Human Rights in Australia”  June 9, 2005  Check against delivery  Introduction  I am pleased to be here today representing my colleague Julia Gillard, the Shadow Minister for Health.  This is a pivotal time for health care and health policy in Australia.   These are the issues we are confronting:  The need for real and substantial health care reform, involving effective partnerships between the Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments.  Reform must address the current duplication and gaps, and ensure a seamless delivery of services across preventive, primary, acute, rehabilitative and residential care.  This will entail better co-operation between public and private sector services and an end to the current environment of cost and blame shifting.    It has been estimated that better integration of services and the elimination of duplication across Commonwealth and State divides will provide at least another $1 billion annually that can be invested in the provision of more services.  

 We need to make the health care system sustainable into the future, but also maintain the  principles of universality and access based on need not ability to pay that are integral  to Medicare as Labor founded it. 

 

 The population is ageing and there are increasing numbers of people living with chronic  conditions and disabilities.  If these people are to have a real quality of life and be  part of the community then we must face up to the expensive, up-front investments in  their care that will deliver these outcomes. 

 

 We need to take a holistic approach to health care that considers both physical and mental  wellbeing, and that sees vision, hearing and dental care as part of overall health care.   

 And we need to act immediately with long term plans to address the health care  workforce shortage and to develop the expertise that we will need for the future.  The  professional silos in education, training and practice must go and a team approach  must be developed to the delivery of primary health care.  This will require flexibility  to meet community, cultural and geographic needs.   

 All of this must be done in conjunction with a revitalised agenda of quality and safety,  and a dramatically improved capacity to collect, analyse and evaluate data which can  inform future activities.   

 I’m sure you recognise that all of these issues play out specifically for mental health  policy, services and resources.     

 Slowly we are realising that mental health is not something separate from the health care  agenda, but an integral part of it.  It’s a part of good cancer care, of maternity care and of  youth wellbeing.  It’s a part of addressing the social justice needs of Indigenous  Australians and it’s a part of our responsibility to the welfare of those in immigration  detention centres and prisons.   

 Tackling this total health care agenda is a daunting task, but it is one that must be  addressed if Australia is to make real progress in providing health care for the 21st  century, including integrated mental health care.   

 Yet to date, the Howard Government has failed this test of good government with respect  to health care reform and strategy generally and mental health issues specifically.  And  most egregiously, the Howard Government has failed the test of good government with  respect to its responsibilities for the welfare of those in detention.   

 At a time when we should be actively confronting the need to reform on health care  issues, we have a Federal Health Minister who is actively refusing to be a player.  His  thought bubbles on health reform, always accompanied by dumping on the States and  Territories, just burst and disappear.   

 It was left to John Howard - urged on by the Coalition back bench - to put in place the  Podger review of the health care system.  From the beginning Howard hedged his bets on  this by ensuring that the inquiry took place behind closed doors, with no formal terms of  reference and selected input.     

 We said from the beginning that it was s a black box inquiry that was unlikely to result in  the needed recommendations for real action.  Now we find this inquiry has become a  hidden Cabinet document, arguably never to see the light of day - certainly never to be  presented to COAG for discussion and possible action.   

 It was left to Peter Costello to ask the Productivity Commission to conduct an  investigation of health workforce issues.   

 And it was left to Parliamentary Secretary Christopher Pyne to grudgingly agree to the  push from Labor and the Democrats for a mental health inquiry.  We can only wonder at  the fate of this committee’s report when Pyne has been quoted denying that the  Commonwealth has responsibility for mental health.   

 Tony Abbott just thinks there is no need for reform.  And he cares so little about mental  health that he has handed responsibility for this over to his Parliamentary Secretary, Chris  Pyne.   

 

 Do we now have an environment for mental health reform?   

 It can be argued that the Governments of Australia have been able to get away with the  lack of a real national mental health strategy (and the resources to fund it) because the  community has allowed this to happen. 

 

 Despite the widespread prevalence and the impact of mental illness on the community,  this has remained a largely hidden condition.     

 However just as it took decades to realise and openly acknowledge that cancer was a  burden all families bear, now at long last it seems that we have reached this point with  mental illness.   

 This new openness and recognition will really help in driving forward progress in mental  health and ensuring that mental health is part of the reform agenda I have just outlined.   

 There can hardly be a family in Australia that is untouched by mental illness.  People  with mental illness and their families and carers bear substantial social and economic  burdens.  The businesses and community structures of this nation also share some part of  this burden, but too often our attitude is that mental health problems are something that  happen to someone else.   

 From the view point of SAVE-Australia, and others who care about the physical and  mental health of asylum seekers, refugees, and those in detention, these issues are now  playing out in an environment that is much more understanding and much more  concerned.   

 This is in large part due to the ongoing lobbying and efforts of professional groups like  yours, to the work of people like Jeff Kennett and Bob Carr, to the willingness of  recognised community figures like Alan Fels and cricketer Michael Slater to speak out  about their own experiences, and most recently, to the publicity surrounding the cases of  Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez Solon.   

 

 Something about the Cornelia Rau case grabbed peoples’ attention and shook their  complacency.  It made them realise that could have happened to them.   

 The case of Vivian Solon highlights the complete indifference of the Howard  Government and particularly the Minister for Immigration and DIMIA, to the plight of  those unable to help themselves. 

 

 Recently a coalition of nine organisations representing health professionals - doctors,  psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses and social workers - spoke out and challenged the  Government to ensure that health care (and specifically mental health care) in the  detention system was delivered in accordance with agreed standards.   

 

 The Senate Inquiry into Mental Health that is just getting under way is an opportunity  which must not be wasted. Too many earlier reports have failed to go beyond fine words  and aspirations.  It is imperative that this inquiry is able to produce an agenda for real  action that will lead to the needed reforms. 

 

 The terms of reference of the inquiry are extensive. To date the Committee has received  over 450 submissions.  They range from detailed submissions from key organisations to  the personal stories of individuals who have suffered mental illness and families who  have experienced living with a person with a mental illness..   

 The Committee will, over the next few months, be holding public hearings across the  nation including capital cities and regional centres.    

 I want to assure you that all members of the Committee are serious about this inquiry.   We don’t want it to just become a forum for blame shifting between the Commonwealth  and the States.      

 

 We need to face the facts about mental illness, and its treatment.   

 1. There is a continuing need for more public education and awareness of mental  illness   

 Research shows that the Australian community does not view mental health as a major  general health issue.  Public awareness of common risk factors is limited.     

 Increased awareness will lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment and a grass roots push to  ensure that needed services are available.   

 Most importantly, it will help remove the current stigma that currently clouds attitudes -  at all levels  -  to mental illness.   

 2. We must address discrimination if we are to ensure better diagnosis, treatment  and rehabilitation   

 The Mental Health Council of Australia and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity  Commission will shortly publish their report into the human rights of people with a  mental illness and the progress made since the Burdekin Report in 1993. 

 

 This will provide a real opportunity to review the issues of discrimination.  The report  will also inform the work of the Senate    

 3. Specific programs are needed to target youth at risk   

 Crucially mental health disorders cluster dramatically in young people when they usually  occur for the first time.  Mental health issues are responsible for 65-70% of the overall  burden of disease for young people between 15 and 24 years of age.    

 

 

 But less than a quarter of young people will get the help they need.  This results in a great  deal of unnecessary suffering for young people and their families and widespread,  enduring, yet largely preventable social and economic damage.     

 Young people typically fail to access care, often having little idea of how to seek help,  and seeing doctors and therapists as authority figures unlikely to offer sympathetic help.     

 It can be argues that young people are poorly served by the health care system as it is  currently structured.  This is especially true for those with substance abuse problems and  with poor family and community support.   

 4. Mental health needs of the elderly and disabled are too often ignored   

 Too often the mental health status of the elderly is overlooked. Symptoms of depression,  confusion or agitation may be due to mental illness, Alzheimer’s Disease or inappropriate  medication.  

 

 There is a large population of older people with significant depressive symptoms, and  consequences of these symptoms include development of other illnesses, exacerbation of  co-existing illnesses, excess use of health services, severe restriction of quality of life,  and unnecessary suffering because of inadequate, wrong or no treatment.   

 The current Senate Inquiry into Aged Care has been focusing on this issue.   

 5. We must do more to address mental health issues that arise because of physical  illnesses   

 There is a growing awareness of the need to address the psychosocial issues that confront  people diagnosed with cancer, or who have suffered other major health crises such as a  heart attack, a stroke or an organ transplant.   

 In 2003 the NH&MRC released its Clinical Practice Guidelines for the psychosocial care  of adults with cancer and there is Level 1 evidence for many of the interventions  proposed. 

 

 6. People with chronic mental illness and their families and carers have huge unmet  needs   

 Over 90% of people with chronic mental illness now live outside hospital and residential  care, so services must increasingly adopt a community focussed approach.   

 Failure to provide these services and to make them readily accessible means that those  with a chronic or recurrent mental illness are unable to lead a full life or support  themselves.  Two thirds of all disability in people aged 15-30 is caused by mental illness.   

 And such failure also means that parents and families must shoulder enormous burdens  with little or no support to care for their mentally ill child or relative.     

 Too many people with chronic mental illness end up in our criminal system - or they end  up dead by accident or suicide.   

 

 

 

 7. We need to be better at providing culturally sensitive care   

 Mental health issues must be handled sensitively for all patients, but that is particularly  true for people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background, and for refugees and  asylum seekers.     

 The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare admits that we have no real data about the  incidence or prevalence of mental disorders among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  people.     

 We do know that the rate of hospitalisation for Indigenous people diagnosed with mental  disorders due to psycho-active substance use is 4-5 times that for the non-Indigenous  population.  And we can imagine that traumas due to the lack of social justice, the impact  of the stolen generations, and the inequalities in services also have an impact on the  mental health of Indigenous communities.   

 8. We don’t have the mental health workforce that is needed to supply care   

 It would not be an exaggeration to say that we have a crisis situation, especially in rural  Australia.  

 Lack of access to training, professional isolation, heavy workloads and limited resources  affect the recruitment and retention of mental health personnel in rural and remote areas.   There is a shortage of mental health nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists and other mental  health professionals.  The Select Committee has already taken public evidence on this  issue. 

 Only 7.5% of psychiatrists are located in rural or remote locations with more than 90% of  those in non-metropolitan areas being in major regional centres like Toowoomba.  Shortages of clinical psychologists are also evident in rural and remote areas. The  situation has been exacerbated by the rationalisation of public services in rural areas that  employed psychologists.  

 These shortages of mental health professionals undermine the development of  intervention and prevention strategies for people at risk. As a consequence of the  shortages, non-mental health professionals in rural areas are more likely to be treating  people with a mental illness. Options for referral are all but non-existent in many rural  and remote areas  

 

 We must look at the current barriers to the provision of mental health services   

 Mental health services are currently provided in a relatively independent, non-cohesive  way due to:   

 The social-economic status of patient - this is often linked to the health insurance status  of the patient;  Geographic factors that affect the availability of services, especially private sector  services;  The fact that acute mental health services are funded primarily by state governments and 

 increasingly, private health insurers, and outpatient services are funded primarily by  the federal government under Medicare;  Other confounding factors such as alcohol and illegal drug use and the level of functional  disability of the patient; and  

 The individual attitudes of health providers, carers and patients themselves.   

 In looking for strategies to address these barriers, we must also recognise some of the  realities. 

 The central role of the GP in the provision of mental health services   

 At least one in ten GP consultations are for mental health concerns.  That is over 10  million GP consultations a year, and some 3.5 million of these consultations are  specifically for the treatment and management of depression.     

 General practitioners struggle to deal with the mental health problems of their patients.   Yet we must acknowledge that for many people with a mental health problem this is the  only treatment they will get, and that for the majority of the population, their GP is the  health care professional they would chose for treatment   

 General practitioners are identified as the preferred point of first contact among health  care professionals.  In a paper published in the Medical Journal of Australia, 71% named  GPs as preferred first point of professional contact. Only 5% would see a clinical  psychologist and 2% would see a specialist psychiatrist. 

 A team approach is needed   

 There is no question that general practice has the front line in mental health care.  But  they need support from mental health professionals.   

 It is imperative that support for a viable and sustainable primary mental health care  system takes centre stage in mental health policy and planning, that there is investment in  building a comprehensive, integrated system of primary mental health care and that  incentives for specialist mental health services, both public and private, are built in.   Family support services must also be seen as integral.   

 

 The Government has broken an election promise on mental health funding   

 At the last election the Howard Government promised an additional $30 million for the  Better Outcomes for Mental Health program.  This programs provides training to GPs to  enable them to better manage their patients with mental health problems, and to refer  them on for mental health services.   

 But when the Budget came out we discovered that this was yet another broken promise.   

 To the four years up to and including 2004-05 the Better Outcomes for Mental Health  program was funded $120 million. In 2005-06 the Better Outcomes for Mental Health  program has seen its funding renewed over the forward estimates but at a total of just  $132 million over 4 years; $18 million short of the original pledge.   

 

 While $30 million wax clearly promised during the election it has not been delivered. If it  had been then the total allocation over the next four years for the Better Outcomes for  Mental Health program would be $150 million, but at $132 million it falls significantly  short. This is a clear case of Minister Abbott yet again breaking his word and not keeping  an election commitment.   

 .We see this as a national disgrace, and have spoken out against Tony Abbott and .   Pyne for thinking that they could get away with deceiving the Australian public on this.    

 

 Mental health for detainees    

 It was an important moment last month when Australia’s peak mental health professional  groups stood together to call for better mental health services for immigration detainees.   

 Labor agrees that clinicians employed by DIMIA and DIMIA contractors to provide  mental health services to detainees should not have their professional standards  compromised. 

 

 Labor’s policy would see mandatory detention retained for the proper purposes of  protecting Australia from health and security risks and to ensure refugee claims can be  dealt with efficiently and failed claimants removed.  But under Labor the system of  mandatory detention would be humane, not a system of punishment. Ninety percent of  claims would be determined within 90 days.   

 Specifically Labor would act to:  â¢ Appoint and Inspector-General to report on and hear complaints from detainees about  detention conditions;  â¢ Get children out from behind the razor wire;  â¢ Return the management of detention centres to the public sector;  â¢ Ensure that health services in detention centres are provided by independent  medical 

 professionals who will be free to speak out on issues; and   â¢ Have an independent committee which would monitor to ensure no one was wrongly  detained or languished in detention for no proper purposes for year after year, as is  happening now.   

 This country has a proud tradition of offering a haven for those whose lives have been  torn apart.    We should ensure that our system -- for both legal and illegal immigrants -- helps to heal  their physical and mental wounds, and does not inflame them.   

 

 Conclusion   

 This should be a time for reform in the health care system, and particularly in the mental  health system.     

 In the absence of demonstrated leadership from the Howard Government, it will be left to  the Opposition, the States and Territories, the health care professionals, community  groups and the patients to force the needed action agenda and change.  We need a  strategic approach and a substantial long-term investment, with the primary focus on 

 patient benefits and outcomes.   

 Labor intends to be a leader in health care reform and to address the issues with strategic  policies developed on a consultative basis and fully costed.  Labor will not shirk the  difficult decisions in this regard.   

 My office those of my colleagues, particularly that of Julia Gillard, are open to you and  we are keen to hear your thoughts and ideas.  We look forward to working with you on  these issues.
