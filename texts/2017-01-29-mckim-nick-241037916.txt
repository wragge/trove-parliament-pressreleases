 Trump throws refugee settlement agreement into disarray: Greens  

 Senator Nick McKim, Australian Greens immigration spokesperson, said today that President  Trump's Executive Order to freeze US refugee and immigration programs leaves  Immigration Minister Peter Dutton with no choice but to bring people seeking asylum on  Manus Island and Nauru to Australia. 

 "Overnight President Trump has thrown the government's resettlement agreement,  reached with Former President Obama, into utter disarray. 

 "Peter Dutton's so-called policies have been exposed as the shambles that they are. He's  making it up as he goes along and his policies are crumbling before his eyes," Senator  McKim said. 

 "Trump has now caused yet more uncertainty for people who have already suffered far too  much at Australia's hands." 

 "Mr Dutton now has no choice but to bring the people indefinitely detained on Manus  Island and Nauru here to Australia so we can support them and help them try to repair the  harm that we have done to them. 

 "The risk now is that politicians like Senator Hanson will take policy pointers from Trump's  latest move which makes it even more important that Prime Minister Turnbull stand up  against the racists in his own party and in the parliament.
