 MEDIA RELEASE 

 17 February 2012 

 More boats since Tony Abbott said ‘no’   

 The latest asylum seeker boats intercepted are the fourth and fifth since Tony Abbott put his own  political interest over the national interest and refused to work with the Government to  implement offshore processing.    

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home Affairs,  Jason Clare MP, said boats will continue to come to Australia unless the Coalition is willing to  come to an agreement with the Government to deter asylum seekers from making these  dangerous boat journeys.   

 “These latest boat arrivals are further evidence of the consequences of the Coalition’s relentless  negativity,” Mr Bowen said.    

 “Every time a boat arrives, Mr Abbott should state why he said no to his own policy of Nauru and  to an independent review into the effectiveness of Temporary Protection Visas.”   

 The Government has been prepared to negotiate with the Coalition to see offshore processing  legislation pass through the Parliament.   

 “In the three months before Mr Abbott said no to our legislation in September, 12 boats with 764  people arrived,” Mr Clare said.   

 “In the three months after he said no, 30 boat numbers with 2,204 people arrived.   

 “The number of asylum seekers tripled after Mr Abbott said no to our legislation.   

 “The boats will keep coming as long as Mr Abbott says no.    

 “If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must stop saying no and pass our legislation  to allow asylum seekers to be processed offshore in Malaysia and Nauru.”
