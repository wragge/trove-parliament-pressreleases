 $21.5 million for 158 communities

 09/06/2005

 158 new projects across Australia will share in over $21.5 million in funding  under the Howard Government's highly successful Local Answers initiative. 

 The Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Kay Patterson, today  announced the additional funding for the new projects will further help  communities to develop local solutions to local problems. 

 "As part of the initiative, communities will work in partnership with government  and business to build better parenting and relationship skills, support mentoring  and leadership and encourage access to training and education by young  parents," Senator Patterson said.

 "One of the successful projects to receive funding under the Local Answers  initiative is Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre. Blacktown Migrant Resource  Centre will receive $149,709 over two years.

 "Under its 'Building Family Harmony in CALD (Culturally and Linguistically  Diverse) Communities in Blacktown Local Government Area' project, the centre  will work with refugees to help them integrate into Australian society by  providing parenting workshops and information about Australian laws and  services.

 "Local Answers, part of the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy,  supports small scale, locally developed projects, which help families and  communities to build their skills and abilities to resolve issues and create  opportunities.

 "The Howard Government has committed a further $70 million to the expansion  of Local Answers, bringing the total funding to $137 million over four years. 

 "As a result of this further commitment, bi-annual funding rounds will now take  place, giving families and communities the power to develop their own solutions  and help them to help themselves.

 "This second round of funding under Local Answers builds on the previous  achievements of the initiative, where 111 projects have been funded for a total  of $19 million.

 "This initiative recognises that local communities are in a position to understand  what their local needs are and how they can best be addressed. 

 "Local Answers is an example of the Howard Government's continued  commitment to helping communities at a local level by providing funding for  local answers," Senator Patterson said.
