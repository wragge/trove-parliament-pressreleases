 NEW IMMIGRATION POLICY BEGINS NEXT MONDAY

 "The new Migrant Selection System which begins on Monday  gives particular emphasis to family migration," the Minister  for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr Ian Macphee, said  today in Perth.

 "Under the new policy, brothers, sisters and non-dependent  children of Australian residents will have a better Chance of  migrating than under the former policy."

 "The new policy gives them a good start where their Australian  sponsor agrees to provide financial support and accommodation  and arranges a job. It will not however guarantee them  automatic right of entry and people should not think that it  will. These relatives must still satisfy migration require­ ments, including an assessment of their economic and employment- 

 prospects. The reasons for this will be obvious to all: we . are determined not to bring people to Australia if they cannot  find jobs and we also need to protect the jobs of Australian .   residents." .

 For independent applicants the new policy will concentrate on  selecting those people whose skills are in demand in  Australia. "In weighing up the options in deciding the new .   policy, the Government took a long term view that Australia  needed the influx of skills, vitality and diversity that 

 immigration brings. However, we could not ignore the fact  that the employment situation was a concern in the community.  That is why there will no longer be independent migration of.  people whose skills or talents are not in demand", Mr Macphee 

 said. · .  -  â   ...

 "In short, to be considered under the new system a person will  normally have to be sponsored by a close relative in Australia  or have a skill that is in demand in Australia", the Minister  said.

 The new policy does not affect Australia's continuing  commitment to the acceptance of refugees and other special  humanitarian cases.

 Mr Macphee said that another feature of the new policy will  be the opening up of the system. The Migrant Entry Handbook  containing the rules governing the selection of migrants  will be on sale in Government Bookshops in a few weeks. This  will enable migrant groups, or others involved in assisting  migrants, to understand the Department's migrant selection 

 system.

 "We think we have devised an efficient and fair system for  selecting migrants, but public scrutiny and feedback will  keep us on our toes," Mr Macphee said. .  1

 Mr Macphee said that the policy was drawn up to benefit all  Australians. "While migrant families and migrant groups have  the most direct interest in the policy, the migration.program  has an impact on all Australians."

 "The new policy will continue the fine achievements of past  immigration programs by making Australia a richer, more  lively and more outward-looking society."
