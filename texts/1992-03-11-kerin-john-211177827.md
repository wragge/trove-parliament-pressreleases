 Australia provides further humanitarian assistance to the Gulf region

 Australia is to provide further humanitarian assistance to the Gulf region, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, John Kerin, announced today.

 The relief assistance, worth $1.6 million, will be channelled through United Nations and Australian non government agencies currently working in Iraq and neighbouring countries.

 "The people of the Gulf region continue to face hardship as a result of last year's hostilities," Mr Kerin said.

 "In Iraq, the crop and food situation remains serious, with the public rationing system able to provide only half the daily requirements. Water supply and waste disposal systems are in disrepair and the hospitals lack medicines and other facilities.

 "Palestinians in the Occupied Territories, Lebanon and Jordan are suffering considerable hardship. Many of those who were working in Iraq and Kuwait are now destitute."

 Australian assistance will be channelled through the following agencies: â¢ $500,000 through UNICEF for its emergency program in Iraq, including water supply and waste disposal system rehabilitation, immunisation and nutrition programs

 â¢ $500,000 through World Vision Australia, including 1 000 tonnes of Australian lentils and beans for needy families in Jordan â¢ $300,000 through CARE Australia for food aid for displaced Kurds in northern Iraq

 â¢ $300,000 to UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees) for emergency work in the Occupied Territories, Jordan and Lebanon.

 Australian emergency assistance for the Gulf region forms part of the Australian development assistance program, administered by AIDAB, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau.
