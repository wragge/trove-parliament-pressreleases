  JOURNALIST:

  

 You must be pleased with the win in the cricket today.

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 Oh absolutely delighted. Congratulations Steve. To 
Justin and to Adam Gilchrist in particular for their superb partnership 
that made it all possible. It really is one for the record books. An 
astonishing performance. The third best ever in history on the last 
innings of a match. It totally disrupted Question Time. It was impossible 
for people to concentrate on Question Time today but it seems as though 
Australia’s sporting achievements this year just keep going on and 
on. And congratulations. A superb, brilliant fight back.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Mr Howard, how much are you looking forward to going 
to East Timor on the weekend?

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 Well I certainly look forward very much to personally 
thanking General Cosgrove who really has done this country proud. He’s 
done a marvelous job. He’s a great leader. And it’s an opportunity 
to simply say thank you to the men and women who are over there, who’ve 
risked their lives. They’re still working in very dangerous circumstances 
and I certainly look forward to seeing them and thanking them personally 
for the magnificent way that they’ve represented our country; the 
wonderful way in which General Cosgrove has led INTERFET, and a reminder 
of the speed with which this operation was put together; the tremendous 
professionalism and skill that the General and his colleagues have brought 
to the operation; but importantly to see some of the faces of the children 
of East Timor and to see the people of that territory that have suffered 
so much, and to see them living in different and happier circumstances.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 How historically significant is it that an Australian 
Prime Minister sets foot on that soil so soon after independence?

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

 Well it’s important in the sense that we led the 
international effort to validate the vote of the East Timorese people, 
and that is a very significant event. Australia showed leadership, Australia 
acted quickly, Australia acted with skill, and Australia did it because 
it was the right thing to do and because it was in our national interest 
to do so.

  

  JOURNALIST:

  

 Your reaction to Labor’s announcement that it will 
support your changes to refugee visas for illegal arrivals.

  

  PRIME MINISTER:

  

  Well I’m very  pleased about that. It’s a sensible position 
for the Labor Party to take. I always welcome support from the Labor 
Party when it’s forthcoming and I think they’ve done the right thing. 
Thank you.

  

 [Ends]
