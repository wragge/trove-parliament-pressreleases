 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling Labor’s funding cuts have comprised our  border protection forces May 30, 2012

 It was revealed in Senate Estimates that Navy patrol vessels used by Border Protection Command are stretched beyond  capacity and are given no funding from Labor to cope with the extra vessel maintenance, Shadow Minister for Justice,  Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan and Shadow Parliamentary Secretary to the Shadow Attorney-General,  Senator Gary Humphries said. 

 Mr Keenan said: “The Navy are operating at a tempo that they could not possibly have envisaged because they didn’t  expect Labor to have so comprehensively destroyed our border protection policies.

 This is taking a very heavy toll on the Armidale patrol boats which subsequently require more vessel maintenance, yet  Labor have not allocated any additional funding to cover these extra costs but instead cut $25.9 million and 190 staff from  our frontline border protection agency.

 “The constant influx of illegal boat arrivals is showing no sign of slowing yet Labor continue to slash funding from Customs  and Border Protection Command - leaving them unable to adequately protect our borders.

 “Border Protection Command are so overstretched that on May 15th that they had to outsource their responsibilities to a  single AFP officer, in an inflatable vessel, to intercept a boatload of 63 illegal arrivals off Cocos Island - this is a clear  indication of how dire the situation at our borders is,” Mr Keenan said.

 Senator Humphries said: “The Chief of Navy has confirmed to me that Navy’s capability has dropped significantly, and this  advice was given to Government earlier this year.

 “Navy’s patrol boats won’t return to full capability until July 2013 as they simply didn’t anticipate the increased use in a  high intensity environment and the wear on the equipment.

 “Australia’s Navy now has a gap in capability, that won’t be rectified for over a year - this should be a major concern for  Government, yet Labor continue to cut the Defence budget and increase Navy’s workload”, Senator Humphries  concluded.
