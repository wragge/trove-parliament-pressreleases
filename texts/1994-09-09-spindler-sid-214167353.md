 Refugees losers in abuse of  Parliamentary Process

 Todays passage of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 is  an unedifying example of how shabby the parliamentary process can get when  the Keating Government is supported by a compliant Coalition, according to  the Australian Democrats.

 Democrat Senator Spindler tried to defer the final vote on the bill until the  Senate had an opportunity to properly consider a Scrutiny of Bills Committee  Report critical of three major aspects of the Bill.

 The all Party Committee had met only yesterday and tabled its report this  morning as the debate on the Bill began.

 However, the Coalition decided to support the Government in pushing the Bill  through despite the Committee's concerns about:

 â¢ the retrospectivity of the Bill;

 â¢ the fact that the Minister's discretion in individual cases was not  subject to review; and

 â¢ parliamentary scrutiny of any future ministerial regulations was  deferred for 6 months.

 The Bill will enable the government to send back to China whole boatloads of  refugees without individual assesment as required under our international  obligations.

 Moreover, the Government is now able to do that by declaring China a 'safe  third country' despite China's abysmal human rights record and despite the fact  that China is the very country which these people are fleeing.

 "It is a black day for the Australian Parliament and Mr John Howard will rue  the day he lent his name to such a shonky process and such appalling  legislation which discriminates against refugees from Vietnam and China," 

 Senator Spindler concluded.
