 PETER GARRETT MP 

 Member for Kingsford Smith 

 Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Reconciliation and the Arts 

 Address to the St Thomas More’s Forum - Campbell ACT 

 18/10/06

 ‘Peacemaking for Christians in the 21st Century’ 

 Thank you for the invitation to speak to the St Thomas More’s Forum tonight.

 I acknowledge the traditional owners of this land - the Ngunnawal people. 

 And  I  welcome  Pope  Benedict’s  statement  last  week  that  no  one  could  be  

 exempt from ‘reconciliation’ if Australia is to achieve a harmonious future. 

 I wonder if his Holiness was referring to anyone in particular? 

 We all share a universal response to the out of proportion suffering that war 

 brings  to  the  young  who  as  soldiers  come  face  to  face  with  its  horror,  to  

 women  who  bear  the  brunt  of  loss  and  often  experience  physical  violence,  

 and to the innocent civilian. 

 We share a collective history too.

 The  remembrance  expressed  in  the  War  Memorial  not  far  from  here,  in  the  

 Holocaust museum in Berlin, in the experiences of the Indigenous people in 

 this country. 

 Peace is a word freighted up with meaning, encompassing an almost infinite 

 and wide range of situations and experiences, as one writer put it “… to talk 

 about peace is to evoke everything and nothing”. 

 2

 At its most basic  we understand peace to mean the state where there is  an 

 absence of war; that is, where large scale violence is absent. 

 But  it  has  come  to  mean,  additionally,  a  state  where  there  are  sufficient  

 conditions for a just society, the absence of which often leads to conflict.

 The  statistical  evidence  of  the  need  for  peacemaking  in  the  world  is  

 overwhelming with vast amounts spent on armaments, and poverty a fact of 

 life for 1.3 billion people. 

 It is self evident that peacemaking in all its guises is as important today as it 

 has ever been.

 And  there  is  a  tradition  of  peacemaking,  which  includes  thinking  seriously  

 about  war,  that  Christians  have  long  followed  and  which  continues  to  be  

 relevant in the present.

 It is true that there is much in the history of the Christian church, including the 

 Catholic  Church,  that  has  seen  violence  committed  in  the  name  of  God;  

 historical acts now recognised as error.

 But  for  centuries  many  Christians,  including  those  indomitable  peacemakers  

 the  Quakers,  have  wrestled  with,  and  tried  to  follow  the  words  of  Jesus  to  

 “turn the other cheek, and to love your enemies”.

 Out  of  such  succinct  but  tough  teaching,  peacemaking  is  held  to  be  a  

 requirement for the Christian life.

 ----------------------------

 The Parliament I entered in 2004 has many people of Christian faith serving in 

 it, but it is going through a very martial phase.  

 3

 The House of Representatives often pauses, as it should, to remember those 

 who sacrificed, and sacrifice, their lives in war.

 But it seldom reflects deeply on the issues of Australia’s future peacemaking 

 role in relation to the ongoing violence that plagues the world. 

 The government offers continuing and unqualified support for the war in Iraq. 

 It  emphasises  every  announcement  concerning  possible  threats  to  security,  

 knowing  that  in  uncertain  times  by  looking  strong  on  terror  it  can  take  an  

 advantage and enforce an impression that the Labor opposition is weak.  

 In fact the mantra of the Minister for Foreign Affairs is to repeat that phrase, 

 plus  a  few  others  that  sound  pithy  but  mean  nothing,  and  to  persist  in  the  

 conceit, that notwithstanding the small size of our deployment in Iraq, we can 

 wield real influence in the Middle East.  

 In fact Iraq has become a terrible quagmire, with a full blown civil war raging 

 and hundred of citizens being killed everyday. Current estimates put the total 

 between 43,000 and 49,000 people. 

 The United Nations is often dismissed; unless, of course, as in the case of the 

 immediate  crisis  concerning  North  Korea,  where  they  are  called  upon  to  fix  

 the problem immediately. 

 In  short,  my  experience  is  this  government  tends  always  to  play  domestic  

 politics  with  war,  and  rarely  focuses  deeply  on  what  is  needed  to  bring  the  

 world closer to peace. 

 ------------------------------------

 The history of the 20th century - with approximately 170 million war dead, the 

 majority of these due to wars within states, weighs down on this generation. 

 4

 It isn’t easy to respond to this past nor to build models for a peaceful future in 

 an age where people are willing to blow themselves up, as well as innocent 

 others,  and  where  nuclear  weapons  breakouts  threaten  the  stability  of  the  

 international order.

 In Australia these questions are especially pertinent since the commitment to 

 a long running and expensive war in Iraq, last count $1.9 billion and rising, a 

 war that has added to, not lessened the terrorist threat.

 Interestingly the issue of the conduct of this war now permeates public debate 

 in two out of the three nations that make up the ‘coalition of the willing’, to the 

 extent that the political future and the historical record of both President Bush 

 and  Prime  Minister  Blair  are  being  assessed  in  the  light  of  the  failing  Iraq  

 excursion.

 Since the outset of the war when many people, myself included, marched in 

 opposition, the debate about Iraq hasn’t reached the same level of intensity as 

 it  has  in  other  countries,  although  Labor  is  pressing  the  issue  hard  in  

 Parliament. The distance, and thankfully the absence of significant Australian 

 casualties, puts Iraq at one remove. 

 But  the  questions  that  have  long  been  raised  about  the  legitimacy  of  the  

 reasons  for  going  to  war  in  Iraq  need  to  be  answered.  Especially  when  the  

 justifications offered: finding weapons of mass destruction, pursuing Saddam 

 Hussein,  containing  terrorism,  building  a  democratic  Middle  east,  have  in  all  

 cases bar one, been found wanting.

 There is a continuing flood of reassessments by senior military officers, new 

 intelligence reports and books including Bob Woodward’s State of Denial that 

 point to evidence of conspicuous policy failure concerning Iraq. 

 And  we  now  have  to  seriously  ask  whether  in  taking  up  this  war  -  

 characterised  as  a  war  against  terrorism  -  we’ve  left  behind  the  basic  

 5

 principles  that  govern  the  conduct  of  war  and  those  democratic  values  and  

 legal protections that the campaign in Iraq is ostensibly aiming to protect. 

 I  should  take  this  opportunity  to  speak  on  the  values  debate  at  this  point,  

 which has been in the news of late, in relation to three contemporary elements 

 of the involvement of Christianity in politics.  

 First, there is a fair amount of fuzziness about where the line of demarcation 

 between church and state, that is the separation of church and state, lies.

 This  separation  is  a  principle  I  firmly  believe  in,  while  also  believing  that  

 someone's  personal  values  should  and  do  inform  one's  day  to  day  thought  

 processes and decision-making.  

 But  there  is  way  too  much  selective  following  of  the  rule  nowadays  by  this  

 government.  It  invokes  the  authority  and  wisdom  and  so-called  

 legitimate  involvement  of  the  church  in  politics  and  policy-making  when  that  

 involvement is pro-government policy. 

 And  the  Howard  Government  directly  uses  various  congregations  and  

 speeches  to  them  to  promote  government  policies;  but  when  the  church  

 points  out  human  rights  and  humanitarian  values  "shortcomings"  and  

 "failures” of the government, for example in relation to refugee policy, then the 

 church is loudly deemed to have no place in such discussions and told, often 

 not so politely, to go away quietly.  

 Second, it is very much "do as I say, not as I do" with this government.

 It  falsely  promotes  itself  as  having  a  monopoly  on  "Christian"  values  and  

 upholding a set of ethics and principles which are in strict keeping with those 

 values - yet its actions do not accord with them.

 6

 What  is  ‘Christian’  about  the  treatment  of  David  Hicks?  What  is  ‘Christian’  

 about  the  treatment  of  asylum-seekers?  What  is  ‘Christian’  about  believing  

 that sleep deprivation and other harsh treatment of arrestees is not torture?

 Finally,  let's  by  all  means  have  a  discussion  about  personal  values,  and  

 Christian values, and humanitarian values, without the strong suggestion that 

 there  is  only  one  correct  set  of  them  -  the  set  the  government  claims  sole  

 ownership  of  -  and  anyone  of  any  other  religion,  opinion  or  general  set  of  

 beliefs  is  sidelined,  or,  at  best,  "tolerated",  but  certainly  not  respected  or  

 accepted.

 The spectre of the West being involved in or effecting the use of torture, the 

 forceful  removal  of  suspected  terrorists  to  countries  not  connected  with  the  

 war  to  enable  interrogation  outside  the  legal  systems  of  Western  countries,  

 and  the  imprisonment  of  alleged  terrorists  without  proper  legal  process  are  

 troubling many lawyers, church leaders and members of the public.

 So what should our response be in these circumstances? 

 Other than the formal interaction between nations through the United Nations 

 and  the  Security  Council,  there  is  a  range  of  approaches  that  might  be  

 described as the antidotes to war, in other words, peacemaking.

 These  include  initiatives  both  through  the  UN  and  its  agencies  and  other  

 international  organisations,  and  at  the  personal  level  inter-faith  dialogue  

 between  religious  groups,  citizen  to  citizen  exchanges  to  increase  

 understanding.

 There is a host of options and actions that can bear fruit. And here the role of 

 Non  Government  Organisations  (NGOs)  who  provide  the  heavy  lifting  in  aid  

 relief and community building in war torn regions is critical. 

 7

 It  is  undeniable  that  organisations  like  Caritas,  World  Vision,  the  Red  Cross  

 and a host of others bring expertise and compassion to bear in troubled parts 

 of the globe. 

 Their  work,  including  their  advocacy  for  the  poor  and  those  caught  in  the  

 cross fire of violence, is of enormous value. 

 Standing  up  for  peace,  reconciliation  and  healing  where  peace  has  been  

 absent often means working with communities through long days and nights, 

 as  for  example  Australian  Catholic  nuns  did,  and  still  do,  for  the  people  of  

 Timor Leste during their darkest hours and as they continue the difficult task 

 of rebuilding their nation. 

 At all times the exercise of citizen’s voices both here and overseas, and the 

 involvement  they  have  with  the  political  processes  of  their  country,  is  the  

 oxygen that breathes life into peacemaking. 

 My reading of Jesus’ call to turn the other cheek, is that not only is it a clear 

 rebuttal of the literality of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, but it is 

 also a practical insight into how arguments that justify the use of violence on 

 the grounds that violence has already occurred can be countered.

 It  is  a  fact  that  it  is  that  much  harder  to  break  a  cycle  of  violence,  once  

 retribution has started.

 The injunction to love your neighbours and pray for those who persecute you 

 meant  the  early  Christian  writers,  in  the  main,  were  clear  that  violence  and  

 war making was unchristian.

 This  ‘just  war’  principle  evolved  to  address  the  question  of  what  happens  

 when there is a greater evil that will be committed if violence is not countered.  

 8

 Developed  by  the  Christian  fathers,  fleshed  out  by  thinkers  like  Grotius,  

 affirmed  by  St  Thomas  Aquinas,  and  articulated  in  Catholic  teachings  it  

 remains a cornerstone of the Christian response to war. 

 In its most general description the justification of the use of violence, let alone 

 go  to  war,  is  grounded  in  the  rights  of  states  to  exercise  order  through  

 maintaining armies. The state possesses the right to self defence, where the 

 use of force is a last resort.

 There  are  a  number  of  important  qualifications  including  the  need  to  aim  to  

 minimise  civilian  casualties,  of  the  desirability  of  a  short  engagement,  of  

 ensuring  the  injured  are  given  prompt  treatment.   All  of  which  have  been  

 emasculated in the majority of wars in the modern era. 

 But Christian doctrine is not comfortably numb to the scenario of unmitigated, 

 unlawful aggression.

 Even Gandhi, the champion of non violence, demurred that sometimes violent 

 resistance to evil was better than no resistance at all. 

 And  Bonhoeffer,  the  great  Christian  pacifist  my  colleague  Kevin  Rudd  wrote  

 about recently joined the plot to assassinate Hitler. 

 We  need  to  remember  that  Christian  doctrine  is  embedded  in  the  just  war  

 principles, not only because the principles inform our assessments about war 

 and peace, and how to address these matters, in ways a utilitarian approach 

 of balancing means and ends cannot so easily do.

 But also because the current outbreak of wars, means we need better, more 

 effective  peacemaking  mechanisms  which  operate  at  the  international,  state  

 and personal level. 

 And  here  one  of  the  crux  issues  is  pre-emption,  when  a  state  launches  an  

 attack when it is not directly threatened. 

 9

 According  to  Grotius,  “The  bare  possibility  that  violence  may  be  some  day  

 turned on us (and) give us the right to inflict violence on others is a doctrine 

 repugnant to every principle of justice.” 

 I  would  say  it  is  clear  that  the  so  called  doctrine  of  pre-emption  which  has  

 been accepted by Mr Howard in relation to the war in Iraq is contrary to the 

 principles of a just war as understood by Christians.

 Unilateral pre-emption throws off the bounds of containment within which any 

 nation  operates  in  relation  to  others,  and  which  is  implicit  in  the  Sermon  on  

 the Mount message; namely do unto others as you would have them do unto 

 you  (not  before  they  do  it  to  you)  and  explicit  in  the  accepted  rules  of  

 international law. 

 It  is  worth  recalling  that  the  establishment  of  a  kind  of  international  order  

 organised  by  secular  states,  through  the  Treaty  of  Westphalia,  out  of  which  

 accepted  rules  of  engagement  for  war,  including  refinements  of  the  just  war  

 principles,  emerged  in  the  late  Middle  Ages  after  a  period  of  constant  

 squabbling  and  conflict  between  city  states  and  kings  with  their  private  

 armies.

 And this happened, as it turns out, a hundred years or so after Thomas More 

 was locked in moral and ultimately mortal combat with Henry the Eighth. 

 As  Brian  Edgar  has  observed,  at  the  time  the  new  states  were  no  longer  

 indulging  in  religious  conflicts  but  reserved  the  right  to  wage  war,  and  

 eventually, having reduced the prerogative of the king to go to war when he 

 wished, even allowed people to opt out of fighting. 

 Over time and with the horror of the so called Great War of 1914-18 etched in 

 their  memories  nations  aimed  to  create  an  international  system  which  could  

 further regulate international affairs and lessen the likelihood of war. 

 10

 The League of Nations emerged, then failed, but following the Second World 

 War  in  1945  the  United  Nations  was  established  with  a  Charter  which  

 declares  that  the  maintenance  of  international  peace  and  security  to  be  the  

 primary purpose of the UN. 

 Interestingly  part  of  this  evolution  of  thinking  and  practice  I’ve  just  sketched  

 included at its beginning a repudiation of the prerogative of the king to wage 

 war - ‘ultima ratio regum’ - the very kind of prerogative that was enacted in the 

 decision to invade Iraq. 

 So from this compressed history story we come to a new cross roads, for the 

 exercise  of  the  war  in  Iraq  has  meant  that  the  principles  that  govern  war  

 making  have  been  thrown  over.  And  the  Christian  response  should  be  to  

 challenge this reversal of principle and practice. 

 In  the  meantime  the  existing  just  war  framework  can  serve  as  a  basis  to  

 develop new peacemaking actions where justice and commitment to the poor 

 is central. 

 And  here  what  better  example  than  the  world  wide  ‘Make  Poverty  History  

 Campaign’, which originated out of the movement for Jubilee Debt Relief and 

 others, and involved numerous young people, including many Christians, and 

 which resulted in the UN adoption of the Millennium Development Goals. 

 The rule breaking that defines Christ’s mission as recorded in the gospels is 

 the ushering in of an age where peace is pre-eminent, not one where war is 

 justified.

 We shouldn’t lose sight of this mission as we contemplate peacemaking in the 

 new century.
