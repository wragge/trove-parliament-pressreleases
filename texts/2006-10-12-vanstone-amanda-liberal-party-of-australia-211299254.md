  Latest Refugee and Humanitarian Arrivals 

  Australia in the coming week will welcome 314 refugise and humanitarian entrants who are  among those most in need of resettlement, Minister (or Immigration and Multicultural  Affairs Amanda Vanstone said today. 

  "Of these arrivals, 234 are refugees, many of whom 'have been waiting in refugee camps  for years," Senator Vanstone said. 

  Refugees are people who are outside their country of nationality and are unable to return  because they fear persecution. These people have been determined to be refugees by the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UIVHCR) and assessed to be in need of  resettlement. 

  The remaining 80 people are Special Humanitarian IProgram (SHP) entrants. They have  been forced to leave their home country after being !subject to substantial discrimination.  They also have family or other links with Australia. 

  Included in the 31 4 arrivals are 180 people from Afrilca, 79 people from the Middle East  and South West Asia and 55 people from South East Asia. 

  These are all entrants under Australia's refugee and humanitarian programme which  provides 13,000 places each year. 

  "Australia is able to offer protection to so many people, in part, because of our commitment  to maintaining tough border security," Senator Vansitone said. 

  "There are 80 family groups among the arrivals for this week and there are a total of 60  people who have been granted visas under a dedicated programme for women at risk.  These are women who have lost male family members and are therefore particularly  vulnerable," the Minister added. 

  These refugee and humanitarian entrants will settle across Australia as follows: 

  NSW 58 Tasmlania 33 

  Queensland 42 Victoria 60 

  South Australia 67 Western Australia 46 

  Northern Territory 8
