 MEDIA RELEASE BY LIONEL BOWEN, DEPUTY LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 "The Australian Government deserves criticism for suggesting  that it was necessary for Israeli forces to enter West Beirut  in order to protect the civilian population. It is well known  that there has been a substantial loss of innocent lives in all  Palestinian refugee camps since the Israeli invasion of Lebanon  commenced on the 6th June," said Lionel Bowen, the Opposition 

 Spokesman on Foreign Affairs.

 Mr. Bowen said that on the 2nd July he had drawn the attention 

 of the Foreign Minister to the massive civilian casualties  that had been caused in the destruction of the refugee village  of Ein-El-Haweh near Sidon and that there had been a clear  breach of the Geneva Conventions relating to the treatment of  civilians in time of conflict.

 "All the Australian Government has ever done is give a mere  slap on th

 Mr. Bowen said he fully supported the interim measure to return  the supervisory forces of the U.S., France arid Italy and h e â    noted that this measure was supported by the P.L.O. Leader, Yasser Arafat. "The U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon needs

 to be strengthened and its mandate reviewed".

 Mr. Bowen repeated his previous call for the Australian Government  to demonstrate complete opposition to Israeli policies in  Lebanon by withdrawing Australia’s contingent from the multi­ national force in Sinai. .

 "The Sinai force of which Australia is a part has shielded  Israeli's southern frontier during the Begin Government's  bloody invasion of Lebanon and its appalling series of actions  in Beirut. So far, the Fraser Government's responses to the  terrible events of the last four m o n t h s , and particularly the  massacres of last weekend, in no way reflect the gravity of 

 Israel's actions. The Government must act now in a substantial  way to bring home to the. Tel Aviv Government the strength of  Australian public and political opposition to Mr. Be g i n 's totally  discredited policies. It is imperative that all foreign forces 

 be withdrawn from Lebanon. The country is also torn by civil 

 war between armed factions. They must be disarmed by the Lebanese  Government and submit to the authority of the U.N. Peacekeeping  Force as soon as it has been established."

 "Australia approves international efforts to get rid of all  foreign and factional armed units and to allow the Lebanese  National Forces to take control. The multi-national force  in Sinai was not a properly constituted force under U.N. 

 supervision but an arrangement made by the Israelis and  Americans to involve troops from some other countries to add  respectability to that force." .

 "In Sinai, Australia can now take a political and diplomatic  action which will show the Begin Government that if it does  not change its policies it cannot expect Australia's traditional  support for Israel to continue. Israel, of course, has the  right to exist within.secure and recognised borders, just as  the Palestinians have the right to a homeland on the West Bank,  a properly established autonomous homeland. Israel does not  have the right to expect that other nations will agree that  ends justify means. If Israel continues to act in defiance of 

 international opinion then it must face the consequences of being  treated as an outcast from the international community.."
