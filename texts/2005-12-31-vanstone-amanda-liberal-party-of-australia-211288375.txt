 Increasing Number of Settlers in the Top End

 Australia’s outback has its harsh elements but also a wealth of beauty and opportunities, which appealed to 590 migrant and refugee entrants in  2004-05.

 It is a 20 per cent increase on the number settling in the Northern Territory compared to 1994-95.

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, released the 2004-05 figures today, with more than  123 000 people arriving and settling in Australia.

 Senator Vanstone said this was an increase of more than 11 000 on the previous year’s total of 111 590 and continued the general upwards trend  over the past decade, when just 87 000 settlers arrived in Australia in 1994-95, which is an increase of 40 per cent annually.

 ‘Australia has a wonderfully rich and diverse society as a result, with nearly one in four of Australia’s 20 million people born overseas,’ Senator  Vanstone said.

 ‘On top of these figures are the growing numbers of people becoming permanent residents after arriving in Australia, such as overseas students  who apply for skilled migration onshore.

 ‘Our ongoing commitment to new and innovative visa programs and the increased efficiency and integrity of immigration processing means that  Australia continues to attract more and more people from around the globe.’
