 Media Release  THE AUSTRALIAN GREENS    

 Abbott must rule out deporting Iraqi refugees from Australia   

 Acting Greens Leader Adam Bandt has backed the government's humanitarian effort in Iraq but  called on the government to not return any of the 500 Iraqi refugees currently in Australian  detention to Iraq.   

 “The humanitarian operation is welcome, but the government still refuses to say if Iraqi asylum  seekers in Australia will continue to be returned to Iraq,” Mr Bandt said.   

 "If Tony Abbott sends Iraqi refugees and asylum seekers from Australia back to Iraq, his  newfound humanitarianism is just hypocrisy.”   

 “The government also needs to act on our call for an emergency intake of Iraqi refugees.”   

 The Greens want any military operations in Iraq to be debated and approved by Parliament.
