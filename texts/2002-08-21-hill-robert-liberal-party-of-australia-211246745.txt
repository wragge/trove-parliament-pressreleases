 SPEECH Senator the Hon. Robert Hill Minister for Defence Leader of the Government in the Senate

  

 21 Aug 2002 MIN 20821/02

 TRANSCRIPT

 Doorstop interview

 National Convention Centre

 Canberra

 11:00am, 21 August 2002

  

 Journalist:

 [Inaudible] … for Parliamentarians on Iraq. Will you be part of that briefing that Alexander Downer will be giving?

 Senator Hill:

 Well yes he and I are jointly organising it. We’ve been giving briefings to the joint foreign affairs committee, foreign affairs and defence committee, as requested. This was a request we got yesterday from a broader representation of backbenchers on our side and we said that we would be happy to organise some briefings for them but if a broader representation, say the Labor Party, backbenchers, committees, want briefings we would do it for them as well.

 Journalist:

 And when will that be happening?

 Senator Hill:

 I’m not sure, I think we were looking at a couple of days time.

 Dobell:

 And there’s been some concerns raised that people will have to have special security clearances to be told about what’s going on. Is that the case?

 Senator Hill:

 That was news to me. I heard it on the radio this morning. I don’t think that’s, well it depends what you mean. That was a suggestion that some of our legislative changes could have an unintended

 consequence in that regard and I think that was dismissed by the Attorney-General’s representative. If you ask me the question about sort of what level of briefing can we give to Parliamentarians, then there’s been no change in that regard.

 Journalist:

 And there won’t be any change in your view even when the law changes?

 Senator Hill:

 There’s no intention of any change in that regard. We respect those who are elected by the people.

 Journalist:

 Senator your wife has been quoted in the Financial Review as saying that you don’t like the Government’s border protection policy. Has your wife been accurately reported?

 Senator Hill:

 She couldn’t have been then. No. I’m a strong supporter of all Government positions.

 Journalist:

 So your wife is wrong?

 Senator Hill:

 I don’t think that was actually in quotes was it?

 Journalist:

 No, but …

 Senator Hill:

 No, it wasn’t.

 Journalist:

 Are you saying that report is inaccurate?

 Senator Hill:

 What was inaccurate? I’m not saying what she was quoted, what was in quotes was inaccurate, but I think there were other parts of the report that were inaccurate.

 Journalist:

 Okay, so what is your stance on border protection? Do you support the Government’s stance on border protection?

 Senator Hill:

 Oh absolutely.

 Journalist:

 What about asylum seekers? Do you support the Government’s stance on asylum seekers?

 Senator Hill:

 What in particular?

 Journalist:

 Like making them stay in Woomera?

 Senator Hill:

 I support detention. And I’ve been on the public record plenty of times in this regard. The, you know basically asylum seekers seek to get within the protection of a very generous Australian legal cover and that’s why the numbers of illegal entries were rising so rapidly.

 Journalist:

 What about detaining children? What’s your thoughts on that?

 Senator Hill:

 I think that where that can be avoided it should be avoided. I think it’s very difficult however if a child comes with a mother, so it’s just the mother and child together, or even more difficult if it’s just the father and child together. And you’re being unduly provocative.

 Journalist:

 Am I?

 Journalist:

 Former General Mueller’s made some fairly strong comments on Defence administrative procedures. Are you confident that Defence reform has gone as far as it can go or would you like to see more change?

 Senator Hill:

 I think it can go further. I think there’ve been improvements. I look at some of our recent contracts and I think they’re much better. The AEW&C contract for example. But we still have contractual difficulties. I want to see that improved. We are expected to be much more fiscally accountable these days, and I think that's reasonable. We need to be transparent in our finances and there’s still a way to go.

 Journalist:

 Senator, what’s your thoughts about what you’re going in for today? Will the Federal Government be putting more money in towards improving Defence in this particular area?

 Senator Hill:

 Yeah I think there are two points. I think firstly there is still an awful lot that we can learn from the natural system. And this concept of learning from dragon flies - how their sensors give them this amazing ability to remain stable in adverse weather conditions - is a typical example if you go back to basics and see how nature, what facility nature has given to such as dragonflies to be able to cope with weather conditions, you learn a great deal. I think, so that’s the first point. And the second point is that it’s important that there, in Defence science that there are some areas in which we have a knowledge edge over everybody else. Because of the size of our economy and our Defence establishment, there are a lot of areas where we need to rely upon others to get that knowledge edge. But it is important that we have in certain areas an advantage that others don’t have. And the DSTO I think that does that very well, in working out the niche areas in which they can add value in terms of

 scientific knowledge. And I’m a very strong supporter of them in that

 Journalist:

 So more money?

 Senator Hill:

 They are financially well supported at the moment, so there’s not a plan in view of all the other pressures on the Defence budget at the moment to increase DSTO funding, but I think that is one area in which funding is well spent.

 Journalist:

 If Defence reform has a long way to go, how long do you expect to take? I mean are you going to achieve it in your term as Minister?

 Senator Hill:

 It probably will go forever. It’s part of the evolution that we need to be able to deliver the best possible value in terms of outcome for the dollars of taxpayers money that we spend. And as I said, I think we are doing better now than we were a few years ago. And as each year goes by, I think people have got the right to expect us to do even better.
