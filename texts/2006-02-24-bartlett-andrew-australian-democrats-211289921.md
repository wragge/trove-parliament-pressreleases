 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA                                     FRIDAY 24 FEBRUARY 2006 

 SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT  AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS DEPUTY LEADER 

 LIBERAL’S HYPOCRITICAL STRATEGY - ATTACK  FUNDAMENTALIST MUSLIMS, WOO FUNDAMENTALIST  CHRISTIANS, DIVERT ATTENTION FROM AWB   

 Australian Democrats’ Deputy Leader Andrew Bartlett has slammed the Treasurer’s latest crass  targeting of Muslims as a hypocritical attempt to divert attention from the widening AWB scandal. 

 “The Liberal Party have been openly courting Australia’s fundamentalists Christians, some of whom  openly speak of the supremacy of God’s law, yet smears Muslims who have the same beliefs,”  Senator Bartlett. 

 “There can be no doubt that this is a deliberate, calculated smear by the Treasurer.  Unlike John  Howard, he has no finesse or subtlety in his dog whistling.” 

 “He is just acting like the arrogant bullies that the Liberal Party have become - picking on an easy  target and consciously inflaming community ignorance and fears for short-term political gain.” 

 “The Government knows these sorts of comments will generate outrage and criticism.  As with the  refugee issue, it suits them to have a public controversy on a divisive issue, especially at a time  when they are starting to be seriously damaged by the AWB scandal.” 

 “When Pauline Hanson starts weighing into the debate claiming she has been vindicated, you know  the government is reverting to its tactics of 2001.” 

 “Of course Hanson claimed we were being swamped by Asians, not Muslims, but ignorant bigotry  towards a minority is easily transferred from one group to another.” 

 “If there are any true liberals left amongst the crass bullying thugs that now make up the Liberal  Party, now is the time for them to speak out.  They remained silent in 2001 and allowed grotesque  injustices to occur.  They must not do the same again,” Senator Bartlett said.
