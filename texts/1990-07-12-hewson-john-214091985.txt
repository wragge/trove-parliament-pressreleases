 MEETING WITH PRESIDENT SOEHARTO AND OTHER DISCUSSIONS IN JAKARTA

 I have completed two days of high level Ministerial discussions I   in Jakarta.  The exchanges of view which I have had have covered  a wide range of regional and bilateral issues and have been I   highly productive.

 I was pleased to meet with President Soeharto and to exchange  views on the nigh importance which we both attach to the  Australia Indonesia relationship. 1 believe from a personal j   point of view that this meeting provided an important first step 

 in my developing and understanding of Indonesia and its policies  and it provided me with an opportunity to explain what I consider  to be the significance of the Asia-Pacific region to Australia. *

 in my discussions with the Foreign Minister,  All Alatas,  I  exchanged views on many issues including the future of an  effective US security presence in the region.  stability on the  Korean peninsula, bilateral relations within ASEAN,  and the  urgent need to resolve the growing refugee problem in South East  Asia. But the main focus of our discussions centred on the >  

 situation in Cambodia.  We addressed the current state of the J   peace process as well as the military situation on the ground in  Cambodia.  We both agreed that a constructive role by China in 1   ending the violence and in facilitating free and fair elections 

 is essential.

 I had a particularly useful meeting with the Minister for Defence  and Security, Gen. (ret.) L.B. Moerdani.  Our discussions j focussed on the role and capabilities of Indonesia's armed J  

 forces,  the extent of bilateral defence contacts within ASEAN and  future US strategic policy in the Western Pacific. ,

 I also had discussions with a range of senior economic Ministers.   These included the Co-ordinating Minister for Economic,  Financial  and Industrial Affairs, Radius Prawiro;  the State Minsiter for  Population and Environment, ,  Dr Emil Salim; the Governor of the  Bank of Indonesia, Professor Dr Adriannus Mooy;  and the Junior 

 Trade Minister, Dr J. Soedradj ad Djiwandono.  My discussions with  these Ministers addressed a range of issues including tariff ahd  tax structures,  exchange rate mechanisms,  privatisation, the  environment,  and changes in the banking systems of both our 

 countries.

 I also met with the Publisher and Chief Editor of the Indonesian  newspaper "Kompas",  Jakob Oetama, and discussed with him the  political and economic outlook for Indonesia.
