 A STATEMENT REGARDING ASYLUM SEEKERS   

 

 Enough is enough. The demonisation of asylum seekers by the Labor and Liberal parties for  cynical political gain must end.   

 The Coalition’s recent announcement of TPVs, blocks to legal appeals, and a mandatory  work-for-the-dole scheme for asylum seekers currently being processed in Australia is  unconscionable.   

 Australia has a legal and ethical responsibility to those who come here fleeing persecution.  TPVs are contrary to those obligations and have long been condemned by the United Nations  and international human rights organisations.   

 Blocking legal avenues to appeal is also wrong. Everyone has the right to access a fair legal  hearing under the Australian Constitution. The Coalition plan trying to block the legal rights  of asylum seekers smacks of desperation to appear tough on “boat people” instead of a  genuine concern about the public interest.    

 The mandatory work-for-the-dole scheme for those found to be genuine refugees is even  more galling. Australia has long enjoyed the cultural and economic benefits of refugee  arrivals. Waves of refugee immigration have formed the fabric of Australia.    

 We should be promoting pathways into meaningful employment for refugees, not forcing  them onto indefinite forced-work welfare with no chance of ever feeling welcome or wanted  in Australia.
