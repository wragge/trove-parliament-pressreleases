 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Luke Hartsuyker MP  Federal Member for Cowper   

 26 August 2004   

 

 Hartsuyker welcomes Commonwealth’s million  dollar commitment to Sudanese crisis   

 Federal Member for Cowper, Luke Hartsuyker, has welcomed a decision by the Australian  Government to provide $1 million to deliver the World Food Programme to help fly aid workers  into western Sudan and deliver emergency supplies.   

 Mr Hartsuyker said the funds would help the United Nations humanitarian air service to get  workers into difficult areas to assist refugees.   

 “I know many people on the Coffs Coast have a close rapport with the Sudanese people and  will welcome this commitment of funds,” Mr Hartsuyker said.   

 “Australia already has a presence in Sudan and Chad where poor infrastructure and difficult  weather conditions is making it particularly difficult to access remote areas.”   

 Mr Hartsuyker said the $ 1 million commitment brings the Australian Government support to  the crisis in Sudan and neighbouring Chad  to $20 million.   

 “Australians are currently providing expertise in such areas as health, sanitation and  engineering.   

 “They are also assisting with the construction of classrooms and toilet facilities for almost  200,000 refugees.”   

 Mr Hartsuyker said funds from the Australian Government had also been used by the World  Food Programme to construct temporary offices and accommodation facilities in the areas of  greatest need.
