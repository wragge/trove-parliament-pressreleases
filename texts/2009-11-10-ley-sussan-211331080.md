 CHRISTMAS ISLAND: STANDING ROOM ONLY 

 The Hon Sussan Ley MP  

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs 

 The complete chaos of the Rudd Government’s border protection policies is no more starkly evident than on 

 Christmas Island where the flood of asylum seekers has pushed the community and its facilities to breaking point, 

 shadow Minister for Justice and Customs, Sussan Ley said today.  

 Returning from a four day visit to the Island Ms Ley said the current conditions have pushed both the local 

 community and the detention centre to breaking point.

 “Asylum seekers now know that under Federal Labor if they can reach Christmas Island they have a 90 per cent 

 chance of being waved through to mainland Australia in up to 90 days or less.  

 “The new Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) constructed by the Howard Government and consistently 

 described by Labor as a “white elephant” is now overflowing and plans are under way to fast-track a major 

 expansion using portables, construction huts and even tents.  

 Ms Ley said she met a range of community representatives, including Shire Councillors, the tourism association, 

 local businesses, and she also visited the local school, hospital and the IDC at Northwest Point.  

 “Many locals expressed concern about the ability of Christmas Island and its overstretched facilities to cope with 

 the massive influx which has occurred since Labor relaxed it asylum seeker policies”, she said.  

 “Not the least of Australians’ concerns should be the massive increase in the cost to taxpayers of this Rudd 

 Government policy breakdown,” Ms Ley said.
