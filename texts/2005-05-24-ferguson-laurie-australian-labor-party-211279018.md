 LAURIE FERGUSON MP            SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION 

 FEDERAL MEMBER FOR REID  24 May 2005   

 

 INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF LONG TERM  DETAINEES:  IT’S NECESSARY AND OVERDUE   

 

 The disturbing catalogue of wrongful detentions and deportations demands, at  the least, an independent review of all long-term detainees.   

 Public confidence will not be boosted by the secretive Palmer Inquiry, lacking as  it does, powers for self-incrimination, forced attendance and protection from  defamation actions. 

 

 Rau, Alvarez, Leong and the countless unnamed cases indicate a cowboy  culture in the Department that has to be restricted. It will not be solved by the  Minister’s calls for ‘calm.’     

 Deputy Prime Minister Anderson’s assurances that Mick Palmer’s inquiry task is  “short term” and will not be going “very long” indicate cases other than Rau will  get short shrift. 

 

 In 2002 Labor advocated an Independent Asylum Seeker Claims Processing  Review Committee to review the cases of all people held more than 90 days.   

 The Government should move in this direction urgently and begin examining  options for selective release of detainees who DIMIA assess will cooperate in  further processing and preparation for departure.
