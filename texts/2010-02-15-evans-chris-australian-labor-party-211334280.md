 Senator Chris Evans  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 Liberals fudge UNHCR figures  Monday, 15 February 2010 

 The Liberal Party’s claim that UNHCR figures show Australia alone experienced a  rise in asylum claims in 2009 is simply disingenuous. 

 The data that Opposition immigration spokesman Scott Morrison is using is from an  incomplete UNHCR report.  

 The UNHCR has not yet published its final figures for asylum applications in 2009.  

 Based on the data that is available, trends for many of the countries that receive  large numbers of asylum applications indicate that the worldwide number of asylum  applications for 2009 may not be much different from 2008. 

 On the latest UNHCR data available, Australia was not alone in seeing an increase  in asylum applications in 2009.  

 Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Norway and Poland also  experienced significant increases in 2009. Asylum claims in France alone rose by  6800 to almost 42 000.  

 Australia, like the rest of the world, experienced an increase in the number of asylum  seekers from war-torn Afghanistan. Worldwide asylum applications from Afghans  were up 34 per cent last year (24 657 compared with 18 452 in 2008). 

 Mr Morrison also ignores the fact that the number of asylum claims in Australia last  year was less than half than in 2000 and 2001 under the Howard Government, when  more than 12 000 claims were lodged in each of those years. 

 Mr Morrison and Tony Abbott are in denial about the conflicts in Afghanistan and Sri  Lanka which have seen tens-of-thousands of people flee for safety. 

 The Opposition offers no solution other than a return to the failed and inhumane  policies of the past and to appoint a committee with Philip Ruddock on board. 

 When Mr Ruddock was Immigration Minister, hundreds of children were locked  behind barbed wire and desperate and vulnerable people who had fled war and 

 persecution were left to languish in detention centres for years on end with no  resolution in sight.
