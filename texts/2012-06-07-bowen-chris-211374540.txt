 Chris Bowen MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 Abbott green light sees the boats keep coming  Thursday, 07 June 2012 

 Joint media release with Chris Bowen MP - Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship and Jason Clare MP - Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for  Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel. 

 Tony Abbott's aggressive negativity continues to play into the hands of people  smugglers, with another asylum seeker boat intercepted overnight - the 45th since  the Coalition rejected the government's offer to implement offshore processing. 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for  Home Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said Mr Abbott had backed up his negativity by  voting against offshore processing in Parliament last week. 

 'This government is committed to breaking the people smugglers' business model  with a genuine deterrent, but any offshore processing solution - Nauru or Malaysia -  requires legislation,' Mr Bowen said. 

 'Tony Abbott and the Coalition continue to block this legislation in the Parliament. 

 'This increased people smuggling activity again clearly makes the case for the  Government's Malaysia Arrangement, which all expert advice says can smash this  vile trade.' 

 Mr Clare said it was time for Tony Abbott to stop standing in the way of offshore  processing. 

 'We can help stop people dying at sea, but this requires Mr Abbott to stop blocking  the legislation in the Parliament,' Mr Clare said. 

 'If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must stop voting against offshore  processing and pass the legislation in the Parliament to allow asylum seekers to be  processed offshore in Malaysia and Nauru.'
