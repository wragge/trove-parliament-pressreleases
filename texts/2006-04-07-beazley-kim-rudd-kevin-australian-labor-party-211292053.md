 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON KIM C BEAZLEY MP   

 TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE WITH KEVIN RUDD,  COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY OFFICES, SYDNEY.   

  7 APRIL 2006   

 E & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:     Cole Royal Commission; Uranium; Temporary Protection  Visas; Fuel inquiry   

 BEAZLEY:  Howard, Downer and Vaile have been caught fighting both  sides of the War on Terror.  That’s what this AWB scandal has produced.   Howard, Downer and Vaile caught fighting the both sides of the War on Terror.   

 

 What Mr Howard needs to do, Mr Howard needs to do now is to join his  Ministers.  Put in a statement to the Cole Commission and then go and defend  that statement before the Cole Commission.  The thing about this Commission is  that it is absolutely in a situation where Australian Ministers must start taking  responsibility for their own actions.  It cannot just be a Commission on AWB, it  must get to the bottom of this.  Kevin will talk about that a bit later.   

 For Mr Howard, his fingerprints are all over this scandal.  Mr Howard’s Ministers’  fingerprints are all over this scandal.  The Australian people are entitled now to  straight answers from their Ministers and a straight acceptance of responsibility.   

 RUDD: As Kim’s just indicated there are three Ministerial Musketeers  involved in this wheat-for-weapons scandal - the Prime Minister, the Foreign  Minister and the Trade Minister.  But mysteriously, one of them is still missing- in-action - the Prime Minister.  He’s got to make a full statement and he’s got to  appear before the Cole Commission of Inquiry as well. 

 

 Also, when it comes to evidence being presented, let’s be very clear about this.   The Government up until now has been saying that the AWB never told them that  they were making kick-back payments to Saddam Hussein’s regime.  Well the  key question is: was the Government ever properly warned that this is what the  AWB was up to?  And the answer to that is: on 27 separate occasions they were  warned either specifically about what the AWB was doing or generically in terms  of the abuses, the systematic abuses, which were occurring with the Oil-for-Food  Program - the AWB being the world’s single largest user of that program.     

 Why is it relevant that Ministers appear?  Well, Commissioner Cole,  unfortunately, has been dealt by the Prime Minister a Commission of Inquiry with  powers which are very limited.  Commissioner Cole has only got power at  present to investigate on whether or not the AWB have committed a criminal  offence.  Commissioner Cole is only empowered to take evidence from Ministers  insofar as it sheds light on that question.  That is: would the AWB have  committed a criminal office?  The core thing is this: John Howard has created an  inquiry with rorted terms of reference which are weighted entirely against the  AWB and which seek to get the Government off scot-free.     

 If John Howard has nothing to hide, he would widen those powers right now to  give Commissioner Cole the powers to make a determination about whether  Howard Government Ministers did their job under Australian law.  Commissioner  Cole does not have those powers right now.  You see, at the end of the day,  remember this: when it comes to this overall scandal there are three parties  involved - the United Nations, the AWB and the Howard Government.  There’s  been an inquiry into the UN, that was the Volcker Inquiry.  Right now there’s an  inquiry with limited terms of reference into the AWB, but so far, no inquiry at all  into whether or not Howard Government Ministers did their job.     

 Under Australia’s Customs regulations the Foreign Minister and the Government  generally were responsible for approving each and every one of these 41 corrupt  contracts between the AWB and Saddam Hussein’s regime.  And guess what?  

 They approved each and every one of those forty one.  Result?  $300 million into  Saddam Hussein’s back pocket.  So, if people ask why is it relevant that  Ministers appear, why is it relevant that the Prime Minister appear, why is it  relevant that the powers of this inquiry should be extended?  The answer lies in  the fact the Howard Government approved each of these corrupt contracts in the  first place.   

 JOURNALIST: Given the terms of reference to this inquiry, do you think  anything is really going to come of Vaile and Downer appearing?   

 BEAZLEY:  It is very important that Vaile and Downer be properly cross-examined.  Properly cross-examined by Mr Agius, properly cross-examined by  the lawyers who are there with an interest in the proceedings, including those 

 associated with AWB.  That is very important.  At least it will give us a chance of  getting at some of the truth.  And it will also, if done properly increase pressure  for a proper term of reference getting at Government accountability in this area.   The Government, Ministers and officials are not being held to the standard of  accountability that AWB officials are.  And at the very least the Australian people 

 would want to see that.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you think this will now increase the likelihood of Howard  appearing before the Cole Inquiry (inaudible)?   

 BEAZLEY:  Too early to tell.  It increases pressure for Howard to appear.   Howard has got to start accepting responsibility for this.  He has been caught out  fighting both sides of the War on Terror in this scandal and the public wants  some answers.  John Howard is primarily responsible for his Government,  secondarily responsible for Downer and Vaile.  They are now caught in the net  but the fingerprints of all of them are all over this scandal.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you actually believe the Prime Minister will front the  inquiry at some stage?  Is it going to get to that stage?   

 BEAZLEY:  I’m saying he should.  I’m saying the Prime Minister should  front that inquiry - he should lay out his state of knowledge.  It is quite evident  from the evidence that has been presented to the Commission and the evidence  expands everyday.  Kevin was referring, for example, to the fact that Alia was  obviously well known, obviously well known to our officials in Jordan throughout  this crisis.  There are just too many intersection points between evidence before  this inquiry, events associated with that evidence and knowledge passing into the  Prime Minister’s office and the Ministers’ offices.  It’s got to the point now where  the Prime Minister should be prepared to tell all he knows.     

 RUDD:  To add to the point on Alia, which Kim’s just touched on, the  Howard Government has maintained up until now that this front company for  Saddam Hussein’s regime called Alia, was something beyond the Government’s  knowledge.  They simply didn’t know about his company.  Well, what we had last  night was an interview with the head of Alia, where the head of Alia confirmed  that in fact he was invited, from time to time, to the Australian Embassy in Jordan  for diplomatic functions.  How does that square with the Howard Government  saying that none of their officials had any knowledge of this company called Alia,  when the truth is the company itself had been invited on multiple occasions to  functions involving Australian Government officials?  Frankly, this is one of the  other things which just doesn’t add up with this Government’s account of its  involvement in the $300 million Wheat for Weapons scandal.     

 And, as for the Prime Minister, people ask why should he be called before this  inquiry.  John Howard took us to war in Iraq.  What he didn’t tell the Australian  people was he had managed to bankroll the Iraqi regime before we went to war.   If that isn’t reason enough for him to appear, I don’t know what is.   

 JOURNALIST: Effectively, nothing will have changed, though, in that the  Prime Minister has to recommend to Commissioner Cole to expand the terms of  the reference.  Is that the position?   

 BEAZLEY:  Yes, that’s absolutely right.  The terms of reference are in  the gift of the Government.  What the job of the Opposition to do, and I would say  the media in this regard, is to put pressure on the Government to make them  ‘fess up - to make them do the honourable thing.  I hold no brief for the AWB 

 types who got themselves swept up in this and they’ve been justifiably subject to  great scrutiny.  But you can’t help feeling a sneaking sense of sympathy and a bit  of a feeling that the Government is setting them up as fall guys to evade  responsibility themselves.  That will always leave a bad taste in the mouths of  those who have taken an interest in this matter in the back of the Australian  people’s minds.  This Government is evading, as far as it can, its responsibility  for this shocking scandal. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley on another matter, you said at lunch today you  felt under no pressure from John Howard to change Labor’s three uranium mine  policy.  It’s really Martin Ferguson and Peter Beattie that you’re under pressure  from.   

 BEAZLEY:  You know, it’s interesting, today I know why John Howard is  putting that pressure on.  What John Howard is trying to do is to focus attention  on us while he gets on with his plans for nuclear power in this country.  Howard  said it today, Costello said it yesterday, or the day before yesterday.  This  Government wants a nuclear power industry in this country and they don’t want  any focus on it.  Well, the simple fact of the matter is that he should go to the  Australian people and tell them what he’s honestly up to.  He should also invite  them to bid for that reactor in their own suburbs.  I suspect he’d have a few  problems if he were to start to do that.     

 We will arrive at the right uranium policy when our Conference has an  opportunity to discuss it.  That uranium policy will properly reflect the fact that it is  a part of our exports, and that it is a good material which requires very careful  handling and appropriate contracts, appropriate bases to those contracts with  those to whom we sell it.  I am not convinced we’ve got the right arrangements in  place and we need to get them. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Will the Labor Conference come forward so you’ve got more  time to get traction   

 BEAZLEY:  No.  Look, let’s get this absolutely clear.  We’re seeing now a  doubling in size of Roxby Downs.  We’re seeing coming on stream the  Honeymoon Mine.  Those alone will more than adequately fulfill every  foreseeable contract into the medium term with China and anyone else we sign  up to.  We had the opportunity to look at this carefully and that’s appropriate.  As  I’ve said before, it’s not a question of who digs it up, it’s a question of the terms  and conditions on which it’s sold.  That’s where we need to come to a correct  conclusion.  John Howard is undermining the non-proliferation component of it  and he’s hiding an agenda which will be revealed after the next election if he’s re-elected, to introduce nuclear power in this country.  We are clear-cut.  We say no  to a nuclear power industry for Australia.  We say yes to a nuclear non-proliferation regime that works and is effective and we say the main issue is the 

 terms and conditions under which this is sold, and we have plenty of time to deal  with the secondary issue of who digs it up.   

 JOURNALIST: India’s out of the question?   

 BEAZLEY:  For me, India is absolutely out of the question, not because  we wish them ill.  As far as we’re concerned, we think that India should be part of  APEC.  We think that want to see India more directly involved in the trading  arrangements which are developing in the Asia-Pacific and we want a close  relationship with them.  The simple fact of the matter is we have to stand for  something in international politics as the country which is going to be the world’s  biggest supplier of uranium.  The thing we have to stand for absolutely is non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.  We absolutely have to stand for that - clear-cut,  no compromises.   

 

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, the Prime Minister spoke this morning about  reviewing the way Australia grants entry protection visas for asylum seekers from  West Papua and taking into account Australia’s relationship with Indonesia.  Is  that the right approach to take?   

 BEAZLEY:  I thought we were supposed to decide who came to this  country and we were supposed to decide the terms and conditions under which  they come.  Now, the fact of the matter is I don’t have any objection to the Prime  Minister looking at those matters.  I do have an objection, if we place ourselves in  the position where we breach our international obligations, we shall wait and see  what he determines in this.  The simple fact of the matter is we are in (inaudible)  a degree of trouble now in relations with Indonesia because he created an  impression amongst the Indonesians that a megaphone diplomacy he conducted  with them at the time of the issues associated with Tampa, that he led them to  believe that he was a tough man on these issues.  Of course, they didn’t  understand the political context in which that was being done.     

 So, they now think that Mr Howard is trying to make a point to them by the way in  which the asylum seekers from West Papua have come into the country.  The  simple fact of the matter is that’s not the case.  We have to tell the Indonesians  that nothing has happened here which sees us, as a nation, stand aside from 

 what is a common position between the Government and Opposition in support  of the territorial integrity of Indonesia, nothing in relation to asylum seekers from  West Papua changes our position which is supportive of what is now the  commonly accepted position in the international community - that West Papua is  part of Indonesia.   

 JOURNALIST: (inaudible) instigate a fuel inquiry?   

 BEAZLEY:  Petrol is hurting Australian families.  Now, we’ve got a plan  to fix it.  We’ve got a plan to move Australia to self-sufficiency in petrol so they’re 

 not held hostage to events in the Middle East, be they in Iran or anywhere else,  as the Prime Minister was saying today.  We need to get Australia independent  of Middle Eastern oil.  Thanks very much.
