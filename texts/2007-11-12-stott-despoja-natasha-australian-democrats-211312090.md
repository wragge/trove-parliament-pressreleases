 JULIAN BURNSIDE QC LAUNCHES HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY    

 The Australian Democrats have highlighted their ‘top 6’ Human Rights injustices and demanded a  response from the major parties under their Human Rights policy, launched today by Julian Burnside QC  at the Old Adelaide Gaol, where 45 people were hanged until 1964.    

 “The major parties need to focus on more than fiscal policy to win the ‘hearts and minds’ of Australia,”  Democrats’ Attorney-General’s Spokesperson Senator Natasha Stott Despoja said.   

 “A decade of hostility towards human rights from the Government has tarnished Australia’s reputation as  a tolerant and compassionate society.    

 “We are the only western democracy without a Bill of Rights, our Indigenous Australians experience  extreme disadvantage and systematic human rights abuses, and the UN has ruled that our migration  policies violate international law,” Senator Stott Despoja said.   

 The Democrats have pledged to update and restore their Parliamentary Charter of Rights and Freedoms  Bill, which has been on the Senate notice paper for six years. The Democrats have also promised to:  â¢ drive real change for Indigenous Australians based on a human rights framework and immediately  ratify the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples;  â¢ abolish mandatory detention and offshore processing of asylum seekers in favour of integrated 

 intake, assessment and social assistance schemes that comply with Australia’s obligations under  international conventions;  â¢ seek an urgent inquiry into Australia’s anti-terrorism legislation to ensure the scales are not tipped  too far in favour of national security at the expense of our democratic freedoms; and  â¢ take a lead role on the death penalty in the Asia-Pacific region with unwavering opposition to the 

 death penalty, and legislate to close loopholes which allow Australian intelligence to convict and  punish people by death overseas.   

 “Australia has come a long way since capital punishment was practiced here at Adelaide Gaol, but when  you look at the plight of the Bali Nine you have to wonder how far we’ve actually come,” lead Senate  candidate for South Australia, Ms Ruth Russell said.   

 “With the launch of our Human Rights Policy today, the Democrats are demanding the major parties take  notice and respond to widespread public concern that basic rights are being eroded,” Ms Russell said.
