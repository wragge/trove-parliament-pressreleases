 GRANTS WORTH $4.3M FOR MIGRANT WELFARE SERVICES

 Fifty-three grants worth more than $4.3 million for migrant  welfare services provided by voluntary organisations were  announced today by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr Chris Hurford.

 The grants (see attached list) will enable ethnic and  other community organisations to employ social welfare  workers.

 "This will help migrants to bridge the 'welfare gap' they  face until 'mainstream' services take over," Mr Hurford said.  "These workers will provide specialised welfare services to  help migrants and ethnic communities become self-reliant.

 "The Hawke Labor Government has increased the number of grants  by 50% to 201. Funding has also been increased by 50%.

 Of the 53 grants (45 full grants and 8 half grants) awarded

 . 13 are for services to emerging communities, most of whose members have been in Australia less than 10 years

 . 25 are for services to established ethnic communities, most of whose members have been here more than 10 years,  and

 . 15 are for services to all migrants, including "specific issues" services.

 "The particular strength of the GIA Scheme is that it helps  ethnic communities identify needs and deliver services. This develops their capacity for self-help and self-reliance  within the mainstream of Australian society."

 The grants are for three years, on the principle that special  services should last only until mainstream services are able  to accept responsibility. (In practice, however, some grants  may be re-awarded if the alternative mainstream services are 

 not yet adequate.)

 "The GIA Scheme plays a key role in helping migrants to  make full use of all community resources and in encouraging  mainstream welfare services to recognise and adapt  themselves to meet migrants' needs," Mr Hurford said.

 Applications for the more than 50 grants available for  award next financial year will be invited by means of  public advertisements in March and decisions announced at  the end of 1985.
