 Australia Welcomes 182 This Week 

 27 September 2006 

 Australia will welcome 182 refugee and humanitarian entrants in the next week, who are  among those most in need of resettlement,” Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs,  Amanda Vanstone, said today.  

 “Of these arrivals 130 are refugees, many of whom have been waiting in refugee camps for  years,” Senator Vanstone said.  

 Refugees are people who are outside their country of nationality and are unable to return  because they fear persecution. These people have been determined to be refugees by the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and assessed to be in need of  resettlement.  

 The remaining 52 people are Special Humanitarian Program (SHP) entrants. They have been  forced to leave their home country after being subject to substantial discrimination. They also  have family or other links with Australia.  

 Included in the 182 arrivals are 101 people from Africa, 39 people from the Middle East and  South West Asia, and 42 people from South East Asia.  

 These are all entrants under Australia’s refugee and humanitarian programme which provides  13,000 places each year.  

 “Australia is able to offer protection to so many people, in part, because of our commitment to  maintaining tough border security,” Senator Vanstone said.  

 “There are six family groups amongst the arrivals (a total of 51 people), who have been  granted visas under a dedicated programme for women at risk. These are women who have  lost male family members and are therefore particularly vulnerable.”  

 These refugee and humanitarian entrants will settle across Australia as follows:
