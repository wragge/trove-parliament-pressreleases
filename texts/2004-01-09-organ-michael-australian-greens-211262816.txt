 ***** MEDIA RELEASE *****  9 January 2004   

 

 GOVERNMENT MUST HELP INDEPENDENT DOCTORS  TO REACH NAURU   

 Foreign Minister Alexander Downer’s admission that Nauru’s  only hospital is under pressure following the hunger strike by  immigration detainees means the government must act now to  get a team of independent Australian doctors to the island as  soon as possible, Cunningham MP Michael Organ said today.   

 “Sending a team of officials to discuss Nauru’s concerns about the  strain asylum seekers are putting on its health system is just fiddling  while Rome burns”, Mr. Organ said today.   

 “With just three doctors and 14 nurses the island’s health system is  being stretched to breaking point, and that situation can only  worsen with the remaining 33 detainees who have called off their  hunger strike now needing urgent attention for a range of problems  including possible kidney problems as a result of their ordeal.”   

 “A group of independent doctors from the AMA, invited to the island  by the Nauru government to assist the hunger strikers, is hamstrung  by the fact that the aircraft used for flights to the Pacific nation is out  of action for servicing next week.”   

 “The hunger strike was called off in expectation of the Australian  medical team’s arrival, and our government must take urgent steps  to ensure that the team gets to Nauru as soon as possible”, Mr.  Organ said.
