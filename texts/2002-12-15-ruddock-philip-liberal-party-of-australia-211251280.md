 Another 119 Afghans Return Home from Nauru

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, confirmed today the second large-scale return of Afghan asylum seekers from Nauru to Kabul.

 The group of 119 men, ranging in age from eighteen to fifty-six, arrived in Kabul this afternoon (Australian time) on a charter  flight arranged by the International Organization for Migration.

 All members of the group took advantage of the reintegration assistance package from the Australian Government which  includes cash assistance of A$2,000 per individual adult or child or up to A$10,000 for a family unit comprising husband,  wife and dependent children.

 "The package offered by the government will enable these people to return home in an environment of safety and dignity to  help in the rebuilding of Afghanistan," Mr Ruddock said.

 "On arrival in Kabul the group will be briefed, and arrangements made so that they can access a range of support services and  make travel arrangements to return to their home towns and villages".

 Mr Ruddock said that members of the group who are not immediately able to access their home towns and villages would be  provided with short-term accommodation arrangements. 

 Of the 428 Afghans remaining on Nauru, and just under 200 have accepted the reintegration package and arrangements are  being made for their return home.
