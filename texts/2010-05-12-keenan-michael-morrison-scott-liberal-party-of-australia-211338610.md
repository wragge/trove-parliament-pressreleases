 Budget boat K123 adds to Budget  blowouts   12/05/10  

 The arrival of  boat K123 on budget day will add further pressure to the $1 billion  budget blowout in detention costs revealed in last night’s Budget, Shadow Minister  for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice,  Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 “An illegal  boat arrival carrying 48 people was intercepted yesterday by the Oceanic  Viking. Last time the Oceanic Viking took asylum seekers on board it ended up  costing taxpayers $3.7 million,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “This time the passengers will be taken to Christmas Island, where the budget has  already blown out, costing taxpayers more than $1 billion, according to figures  released in last night’s budget. This includes a Kevin $777 milliion blowout in  operational costs and $236 million in building works to expand our detention  facilities. 

 “The announcement of the 123rd boat  to arrive since Kevin Rudd rolled back the  Coalition’s strong border protection regime, demonstrates that the rate of boat arrivals  continues at pace. 

 “So far during 2010 we have had 55 boats illegally arrive carrying 2,701 people. This  compares  to 13 illegal boats and 605 passengers to the end of May 2009. 

 “It is also significantly greater than the number of illegal boats and people to arrive  under the Coalition during 1999 to 2001, over the same period. 

 “In the five months to the end of May, the total number of boats and people to arrive  were 25 boats and 545 people in 1999, 20 boats and 1,129 people in 2000 and 21  boats and 1,845 people in 2001. 

 “Under Kevin Rudd, boats are illegally arriving at the rate of three a week, compared  to three a year during the last six years of the Coalition Government.  More recently  we have had six boats arrive in the past 11 days. 

 “No wonder the budget has blown out and costs are out of control,” Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr Keenan said: “This latest arrival has occurred in the shadow of the massive  cutbacks made in last night’s budget to the front line agencies dealing with this crisis. 

 “The budget slashed personnel and the budget of the Customs and Border Protection  Service, cut the funding of the Australian Federal Police and further delayed the much  needed procurement of the replacement for the Bay Class patrol vessels. 

 “Kevin Rudd has weakened Australia’s borders, revitalised the people smuggling  industry, stretched the resources of our border protection system beyond its limits -  and now, at the peak of this latest surge in boat arrivals, he has cut resources from the  front line agencies dealing with his failure. 

 “Whilst Customs and Border Protection and the AFP are forced to endure budget and  personnel cuts, Labor has allocated an extra $800,000 for asylum seekers to be able to  complain to the Government about their treatment. 

 “You really have to wonder about Labor’s priorities when it comes to protecting our  borders,” Mr Keenan said.
