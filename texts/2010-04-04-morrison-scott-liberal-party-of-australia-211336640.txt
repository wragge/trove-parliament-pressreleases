 Boat 103 shows why Kevin Rudd can't be trusted on boats or population  growth 

 Sunday 4th April 2010 

 Kevin Rudd’s failure on border protection, as yet another boat arrives, means he can’t be 

 trusted on population growth, according to Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, 

 Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael 

 Keenan.  

 

 “The arrival of boat 103, carrying 50 passengers, which turned up this afternoon was the fifth 

 boat to arrive in just seven days, yet Mr Rudd still thinks he hasn’t got a problem,” Mr 

 Morrison said.  

 

 “Today’s boat brings the weekly total to 285 passengers and crew,” he said.  

 

 “On Saturday, Kevin Rudd announced Tony Burke as his Minister for a Big Australia. He 

 reports back in 12 months. This is classic Rudd - a plan for a plan after the election. His pitch 

 once again is ‘just trust me’.  

 

 “But how can Kevin Rudd seriously expect Australians to trust him on future population 

 growth when he can’t even keep control of our borders.  

 

 “Tony Burke has become Kevin Rudd’s Minister for Overpopulation, tasked to re-educate 

 Australians on why Kevin is right and they are wrong and that Mr Rudd’s plan for Big 

 Australia with 36 million people will be good for them.  

 

 “Kevin Rudd’s excursion into population policy is just a cynical exercise in political backspin 

 designed to conceal his commitment to a population of at least 36 million by 2050 and divert 

 attention from his chronic failures in immigration and border protection.  

 

 “Kevin Rudd’s continual failure to acknowledge, let alone address, the chaos on Christmas 

 Island caused by his own failed policies, broken promises and flawed decisions is another 

 reminder why he cannot be trusted on immigration policy,” Mr Morrison said.  

 

 Mr Keenan said: “This latest arrival on Easter Sunday is a reminder that while most 

 Australians were enjoying a break, the men and women of Border Protection Command 

 were continuing to work tirelessly to handle the daily arrival of boats.  

 

 “Under Rudd’s broken policy there will be no rest from dealing with these constant arrivals.  

 

 “This Easter weekend has been marred by another boat and another policy failure by the 

 Rudd Government,” he said.
