 Boat 111 arrives - Rudd's failures risking our immigration system 

 Friday 16th April 2010 

 Another illegal boat arrival, the 111th under Labor, is yet more evidence that Kevin Rudd has 

 lost control of our borders and is now risking the integrity of our immigration program on the 

 mainland, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow 

 Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 

 “Today’s arrival comes as Minister Evans still remains tight lipped on whether instructions 

 were given to Immigration Department officials to soft peddle on visa breaches, frauds and 

 rorts,” Mr Morrison said. 

 

 “Once again the Minister for Immigration has gone missing on his watch. At a time when 

 Australians are looking for reassurances about the integrity of our borders and integrity of 

 our system on the mainland, he is nowhere to be found,” he said. 

 

 “The Immigration Department reportedly being told to ‘back off on all non essential visa 

 checking’ due to the overwhelming workload on illegal boat arrivals shows the extent our 

 immigration programme is failing under Labor. 

 

 “Five boats since the Rudd Government’s election fix confirm beyond a shadow of a doubt 

 that the people smugglers are still in charge, with boats coming at a rate of three a week. 

 

 “Kevin Rudd’s election fix will only place further strain on our immigration system, without 

 solving the problem of illegal arrivals,” he said. 

 

 Mr Keenan said: “The arrival of another boat within a stones throw of Christmas Island once 

 again highlights the crumbling state of Australia’s border protection. 

 

 “Border Protection Command, like the Christmas Island Detention Centre, the Australian 

 Federal Police and the Department of Immigration, is over stretched,” he said. 

 

 “Another boat has cruised through the nets as BPC continues to struggle with the mammoth 

 task of controlling the fallout of the Rudd Labor Government’s policy failure on border 

 protection. 

 

 “Until the Government commits to taking real action, the boats will keep coming and our 

 border protection system will keep failing,” he said.
