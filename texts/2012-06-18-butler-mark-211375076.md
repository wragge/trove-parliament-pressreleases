 New mental health workers rolled out   

 Sixty-six new mental health workers will be employed in community support services  across Australia thanks to a $13.4 million boost to the popular Personal Helpers and  Mentors initiative.   

 The new workers will by employed by 31 organisations in almost 50 communities across  the country to provide one-on-one support to local people with mental illness.   

 They will work in communities with high levels of mental illness and need for extra  support services, including Bourke and Wyong in New South Wales and Ipswich and  Logan in Queensland.    

 The new mental health workers will also provide targeted support to groups including  young people leaving out-of-home care, recent migrants and refugees, homeless people  and Indigenous Australians.   

 Personal helpers and mentors assist people with severe and debilitating mental illness,  such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, to set and achieve personal goals, such as  finding employment, and improving relationships with family and friends.   

 By building their confidence and increasing their connections within the community,  personal helpers and mentors help participants overcome the social isolation that can be  so crippling for someone with a mental illness.   

 This latest investment is part of the Gillard Government’s unprecedented $2.2 billion  investment in mental health services, announced in May 2011.   

 These 66 new workers are in addition to the 36 new personal helpers and mentors  announced earlier this year.    

 By 2014 more than 425 extra personal helpers and mentors will be supporting people  with mental illness as part of this Government’s national mental health reforms.    

 The Government is continuing to deliver on its promise to make mental health a priority  so that more Australians with mental illness are getting the care and support they need,  when they need it.
