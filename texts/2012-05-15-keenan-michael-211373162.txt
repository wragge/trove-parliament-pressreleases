 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling PEOPLE SMUGGLERS PRODUCT RUNNING  OFF THE SHELVES AS ANOTHER BOAT  ARRIVES May 15, 2012

 The arrival of another illegal boat, with over 120 people on board, means more than 670 people have arrived in just two weeks  in  continued  response  to  Labor’s  soft  border  policies,  Shadow  Minister  for  Immigration  and  Citizenship,  Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 "Fifty  boats  and  over  4,000  people  have  now  arrived  since  Labor  capitulated  to  the  Greens  and  introduced  community release, including bridging visas, for asylum seekers in late November last year. More than 1,500 people are now able to directly  access  our  courts  through  the  refugee  review  tribunal  after  further  changes  were  introduced  in  March,"  Mr Morrison said. 

 "Labor’s let them in, let them out policy has supercharged the people smugglers product, and the product is running off the shelves. We are on track again for another record month and another record year as Julia Gillard’s soft policies on our  borders make a bad situation even worse," he said. 

 "There is nothing happening on our borders that an election cannot fix. 

 "Over 670 people in just two weeks means monthly arrivals continue to eclipse the 450 the Government forecast for their budget under their community release policy. Labor’s budget on boats is blown before the ink is even dry. 

 "With  no  policy  except  a  lame  excuse  to  blame  the  Opposition,  a  fresh  $1.7  billion  blow  out  on  asylum  seekers  in  the budget  and  people  smugglers  sending  record  numbers  of  people  by  boat,  Labor  has  simply  given  up  protecting  our borders and given in to the Greens," Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr  Keenan  said:  "The  arrival  of  the  latest  boat,  carrying  121  passengers  and  2  crew,  has  proven  that  the  people smugglers are celebrating Labor’s latest Budget attacks on our Border Protection Command. 

 "It  is  hard  to  fathom  how  the  Gillard  Government  can  justify  taking  an  axe  to  the  already  overstretched  and  under resourced Border Protection Agencies given the crisis Labor has created at our borders - stripping a further $25 million  and 190 staff from Customs alone. 

 "It is foolish for the Minister for Home Affairs, Jason Clare, to even suggest that these drastic cuts don’t severely hinder  the ability of Customs to do its job. 

 "The most fundamental job of the Commonwealth is to protect our borders and secure the nation â a job which this Labor  Government has failed to do," Mr Keenan said.
