 AUSTRALIAN GREENS INVEST IN REFUGEE SAFETY   

 The Australian Greens have launched a new plan to give refugees a safer pathway to protection.   

 The plan includes increasing the government’s humanitarian intake to 30,000 a year, providing an  extra $70 million per annum in emergency funding to help fast track the processing of refugee  claims in Indonesia and shutting down all detention camps in Nauru and Papua New Guinea.    

 It comes on top of a Galaxy poll, commissioned by the Australian Greens, which shows that 48  per cent of Australians don’t trust Labor or the Coalition to care for refugees ahead of political  interests, while 20 per cent remain undecided.   

 “The majority of Australians recognise that Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott cannot be trusted to care  for refugees,” Greens Leader Senator Christine Milne said.   

 “They are locked in a race to the bottom to see who can adopt the cruellest approach to refugees,  including dumping them on our poorest neighbours.   

 “As John Pilger said in The Guardian, the election campaign in Australia is being fought with the  lives of men, women and children. This is a disgrace.   

 “Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott have shamed Australia both at home and abroad by turning their  backs on care for refugees.   

 “The Greens are the only political party who are standing up and saying there is a better way."   

 The Australian Greens plan includes:     

 ï· Increasing Australia's humanitarian intake to 30,000 - within that, resettling an  emergency intake of 10,000 UNHCR assessed refugees to Australia from our region to  reduce the backlog. Giving refugees a ‘regular’ path to a safer life, including resettling at  least 3,800 extra directly from our immediate region as recommended by the Houston  Panel.  

 ï· Providing an extra $70 million per year in emergency funding to help fast track  processing of refugee claims in Indonesia, providing shelter and welfare services to  refugees while they are waiting for assessment and resettlement, and boosting the  capacity of the UNHCR in Indonesia and Malaysia to speed up assessment and  resettlement.    ï· Shutting down all detention camps in Nauru and PNG, with Australia to assess the 

 claims of people who arrive by boat.   

 “These policies could be implemented now and they could start saving lives immediately,” the  Greens’ spokesperson for immigration, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The Greens are standing up for vulnerable refugees in our region and for the Australian ideal  that everyone deserves a fair go.   

 “The Greens approach is more humane and it is also the only proven way that Australia has  saved lives at sea in the past.   

 “Malcolm Fraser’s strong political leadership following the Vietnam War saw untold numbers of  lives saved through a humanitarian program that many Australians are still proud of to this very  day.   

 “Rather than competing with each other to see who can be the cruellest to people who deserve  our protection, Australia’s politicians must lead the way in a strong, genuine, regional approach."
