 Acknowledgments

 I wish to acknowledge the traditional owners and custodians of the land on which we meet,  the Noongar people, and pay my respects to their community and to the contribution they  have made.

 I extend that respect to other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who are here  today.

 I’d also like to acknowledge:

 The Chair and members of the Planning Group for the Commonwealth Youth Forum â¢ Delegates to the forum â¢ Representatives from the Commonwealth Secretariat, Commonwealth Youth  Program and Commonwealth Youth Exchange Council â¢

 Introduction

 A very warm welcome to all delegates.

 This is a unique occasion and a big opportunity for the voice of Commonwealth youth to  be heard. With the hope, and indeed I’d say the necessity, that our words here are matched  by action.

 In historical terms as you probably know, this is a country only recently colonised, with  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples living sustainably on this land for many  thousands of years.

 In its modern genesis ours is a youthful country; energetic, optimistic and diverse. And  these are some of the qualities that youth everywhere display. Young people are the future  - literally - and no more so than in the Commonwealth of Nations where, as we have  already heard, half, if not more of the population is under 25.

 Youth then, at this point in time are the agents of change. I know many constructive  proposals and innovative ideas will emerge as you meet. 

 We gather on a platform of increasing recognition of youth. The African Youth charter of  2006, was a pioneering initiative. Last year’s International Year of Youth provided a much  needed spotlight on young people of the world.

 And now there is something for us to consider here, namely that the Eminent Persons  Group Report recognises young people in the Commonwealth and across the globe are  greatly under valued by our societies in terms of the contribution that they make, and the  potential they have to contribute to the present and the future.

 Youth are active in the Arab Spring. In the push for increased democracy and participation  - I see that as the birth right of all young - including in countries of the Commonwealth.

 I encourage you to use this forum as an opportunity to set the record straight, maybe to  change the way you are viewed by society or the media, to make plain the things that count  for you.

 In developed societies, as previous generations continue to dominate in key roles, a true  recognition of the contribution of young people can be overshadowed.

 Elsewhere young people can be held back by fundamental issues such as the lack of  recognition of basic human rights, lack of democratic participation or lack of access to  education. The consequences of these gaps are significant and you have a role to play in  closing them.

 The young people I meet are passionately concerned about their environment, it’s a  passion I’ve long shared, and here how we address dangerous climate change is pre-eminent. The Australian Government recognises that we have a responsibility to take care  of the planet.

 That is why the Government has introduced a price on Carbon pollution. This is the central  element in a comprehensive policy to tackle dangerous climate change, cut pollution and  move Australia to a clean energy future. And to provide a positive example and leadership  for the global community.

 I spent many years working as a musician and also with environment NGOs, so I hope I  understand why young people might choose to work outside traditional institutions and  take the initiative for themselves. That’s no bad thing. In fact we are seeing the global rise  of a new class of young activists and social entrepreneurs who are driving innovative and  sustainable solutions to some of the problems that the world faces.

 People like 22-year old Sabhanaz Rashid Diya from Bangladesh who co founded the One  Degree Initiative Foundation - A foundation uniting children and youth from diverse socio-economic and religious backgrounds in exercising civil leadership.

 Sabhanaz has said that with 45 per cent of Bangladesh's population under the age of 15,  now is the time to prepare the emerging generation of youth with the skills they need to  become active citizens. Under this initiative, an exciting initiative, young people, aged 13  to 26, are mentored or serve as mentors, working together to solve community challenges.

 This approach has been taken up by young people in this country and the United States,  Canada, Nepal and Iraq.

 And here in Australia, Kumari Middleton co-founded Mayibuye, a non-profit organisation  with a vision to use the performing arts to keep young people off the streets. Away from  gang activity, crime and substance abuse - issues familiar to many of you.

 This organisation is currently active here in Australia and in South Africa, promoting  cultural awareness and empowering youth to become positive role models and community  leaders and with plans to expand to Cambodia, where I know the need is great.

 These are but two of the many examples of what emerging young leaders are doing.

 I want to now speak briefly about the Australian experience. Here in Australia, there are  almost 4 million young Australians.

 We have a National Strategy for Young Australians which sets out the Government’s aim  and vision for all young Australians to grow up safe, healthy, happy and resilient. To have  the opportunities and skills they need to learn, work, engage in community life and  influence decisions that affect them.

 The Strategy highlights eight key priority areas for Government action to help young  Australians. They include things like:

 Improving the health and wellbeing for all young people â¢ Equipping young Australians to shape their own futures through education â¢ Equipping young Australians with the skills and personal networks they need to  gain, and be successful in, employment â¢

 Strengthening early intervention with young Australians to help prevent any  problems getting worse and making sure they can get their lives back on track â¢

 In Australia we value the voice of youth and as Minister, I have an Australian Youth  Forum which provides advice and views directly to me. We also fund non-government  organisations to develop local projects that involve productive participation and encourage  social inclusion of young people with their community.

 But as for young people everywhere, we do have some young people in Australia who face  particular challenges in reaching their full potential. Young people in challenging  situations because they are young carers, or refugees, or Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander people or they are living with a disability.

 We focus on these people with specific tailor made policies and programs.

 In mental health we now know that 75 per cent of adult mental health and substance use  disorders begin by age 24 years, and young people are the most likely group in the  population in Australia to experience a mental illness.

 Now this is a big issue for us here where suicide is ranked as the 15th cause of death but  for young people between 15 and 24 years, suicide is the leading cause of death. The  Parliament of Australia has recently conducted an inquiry into suicide in young people and 

 has committed additional funds through the Health Department to help address this.

 Today the Prime Minister announced additional headspace sites around the nation to  ensure that more young Australians get the mental health care and support that they need.  This is a great initiative and an exciting announcement.

 In September this year, the overall youth unemployment rate was 11.2 per cent, much  higher than the total population of 5.2 per cent. So we place particular emphasis on  supporting education with substantial investment, skills development and helping the  transition from school to work.

 Having outlined those issues, I am very pleased to note that a majority of our young people  consider that they are living fulfilled, happy lives and are successfully managing the  journey from youth through to adulthood.

 Australia, as befits a developed country of our size, has recently significantly increased our  Aid program, including delivering a new Australian Volunteers for International  Development program. This includes Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development  who are making a positive contribution to sustainable development by working with local  partners to share their knowledge and skills.

 The aid program is also creating real opportunities for young people in developing  countries to contribute through:

 Scholarships, providing approximately 4,800 to Commonwealth developing  countries from 2011-2013 â¢

 16/04/2012 http://ministers.deewr.gov.au/garrett/commonwealth-youth-f...

 Targeted projects in technical and vocational education and training and youth  employment. For example East Timor’s Youth Employment Promotion Program,  which provides youth with short-term employment training and careers counselling.

 â¢

 I consider this commitment by Australia, to work with local partners to provide on the  ground sustainable solutions, some of our most important work.

 Conclusion

 Delegates, I am delighted that you have joined us in Australia and that we could host  CHOGM and the Commonwealth Youth Forum.

 We take youth and the challenges youth face seriously and we aim to listen and deliver for  young Australians wherever they live.

 Now in this room we have young people representing countries from all over the  Commonwealth. We recognise that youth in these countries are an emerging force for  change, and your participation in this forum gives you a very powerful voice.

 There is a groundswell of support for new ways of thinking and acting within the  Commonwealth, with the report on reform prepared by the Eminent Persons Group to be  presented at the CHOGM meeting.

 So I do urge you to grasp the momentum that has developed and use it to make lasting  improvements that are relevant to you and to your community.

 Issues like conflict resolution, governance, climate change, human rights and building a  sustainable future - all these demand our collective attention.

 So take the opportunity the forum presents to make a clear statement in the communiquÃ©  focused on those issues that are important to you as young people in the Commonwealth.

 Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today and good luck with your  deliberations over the next few days.

 Welcome to Australia.

 Ends
