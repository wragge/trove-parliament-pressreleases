 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  HON ALEXANDER DOWNER, MP   

 

 TRANSCRIPTION: PROOF COPY E & OE   

 

 DATE: April 19 2004 

 TITLE:   Doorstop  -  Melbourne  

 

 ALEXANDER DOWNER:  I just want to mention two or three things very quickly.  First of  all, I'd like to express the deep regrets of the Australian Government and my own personal  regrets at the passing of Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. Ratu Mara was, in many ways, the father of  the Pacific for many years.  Former, long standing Prime Minister of Fiji, was Fiji's first  Prime Minister, and Chief Minister of Fiji before that. And his death is very sad. It saddens us  all, I think. Because he was such a great figure and  he was always a good friend to Australia.  I spent a good deal of time on the telephone to him in May 2000, at the time of the most  recent coup in Fiji. And he has often given wise counsel and assistance in helping to try to  keep his country [indistinct].  So, his passing is a sad moment for the Pacific, it's a sad  moment for the people of Fiji and it's a sad moment for us, here in Australia. And also for me,  personally, who spent a lot of time dealing with him.   

 Talking of the Pacific. I had a meeting today with President Harris and Kinza Clodumar who  is the Finance Minister of Nauru. And we're having a talk about the financial situation in  Nauru. Obviously, Nauru is in difficult financial circumstance.  I made it clear to the  President and the Finance Minister, Australia won't turn its back on Nauru. We will be  providing a Treasury Officer from Canberra to assist Nauru with its financing. And he will be  assisted by two officers from the Department of Finance, our Department of Finance, and I  hope that the Treasury Officer will be able to meet up with President Harris during the course  of this week. And in time he'll be able to relocate to Nauru for some period of time.  We will  also be providing Nauru with a Police Commissioner, too. We've had to negotiate a treaty to  make this possible. We've concluded those negotiations, just the implementation stage is  needed now.     

 The last point I want to make is that, this afternoon, I spoke to the Spanish Ambassador in  Canberra. And I expressed Australia's concern that the Spanish Prime Minister has announced  Spain will withdraw its 1300 troops from Iraq.  We're disappointed because if everybody  followed Spain's lead, then Iraq would be left without security and would become a haven for  terrorists and of course for the Ba'athist, the Saddam Hussein supporters. They may be very  small in number, but they are very violent in action. And it's absolutely essential, as the Iraqi  Governing Council has made clear, that the international forces stay the course in Iraq.   And  so I very much regret what the Spanish Government has done. I made that view very clear  today, to the Spanish Ambassador.

 JOURNALIST:  Can you outline any of the details of the treaty [indistinct]?   

 DOWNER:  Well, essentially what it's about is us providing a Senior Treasury Officer, to  help them reorganise their finances. And two officials from the Finance Department,  Australia's Finance Department. And, also to provide some assistance to the Nauru Police  Force, so they can maintain law and order.  The bottom line is that, as you know, they have a  difficult financial situation. They are in negotiations with a finance company at the moment  about their financial situation. I don't want to comment on that. But I can say that we can't just  turn our backs on Nauru and leave 10,000 people [indistinct].  The situation is, Nauru has  been mined extensively for phosphate. But it's not a mine with a long life left. And the  question, therefore is what their net asset position is, in terms of various assets they have in 

 Australia and around the world. [Indistinct] quite a lot of assets.  And all these things need to  be worked through very carefully. And, I think, our Treasury Officer, with the support of his  colleagues from our Finance Department, should be able to help the Nauruans work through  this position. Once we have a much clearer idea of their net financial position, we'll be able to  talk to them again about anything else that might need to be done.   

 JOURNALIST:  Is any direct financial assistance out of the question?   

 DOWNER: We do provide them with direct financial assistance. As you might recall through  the Memoranda of Understanding. The most recent one, I think, provides for $20 million  worth, or $22 million worth of financial assistance over an 18 month period. And so, we do  provide them with financial assistance.  But they've got to have sustainable finances. And  that's what we're working through with them, and they're working through with the finance  company, GE Finance  at the moment.   

 JOURNALIST:  Nauru has been given [indistinct].   

 DOWNER:  Well, let's just work through the financial situation in Nauru, and not canvas too  much, at this stage, any other options we might have to look at, in the fullness of time.  We  have, other than New Zealand, is giving people an automatic right of entry into Australia. So  if we were to do that for any other country it would be quite a major step for Australia to take.   And at this stage we're not proposing that. What we're doing is trying to ensure that they are  able to sort out their financial situation.  We're not really talking in cash, we're talking about a  very careful examination of their cash flow and net asset position.   

 JOURNALIST:  Are you critical of any way in the way they've ended up like this [indistinct].   

 DOWNER: Well, [indistinct] I guess 20 years, 25 years ago, Nauru would have been the  richest country, or one of the richest countries in the world, in per capita terms. And that  position has obviously dwindled dramatically over the last couple of decades. And we've  really been working with Nauru for the last three years quite intensively on this issue. Which  illustrates the complexity of their financial situation, if I can put it that way.   

 JOURNALIST:  How long do you want to keep the refugee situation [indistinct] extended for  another year.   

 Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500 2

 

 DOWNER:  It has, yes. Well, we just extend it as is seen by us to be necessary. Of course, the  numbers, and they agree, they [indistinct] to agree to this. Nauru is a sovereign country. But  they are enthusiastic, of course, about the continuation of this arrangement. Because it's also  [indistinct] an income for them. And over and above that, I think it's been important to Nauru  that there has been such a focus on Nauru in Australia.  Actually, the fact that Nauru has  hosted this processing facility is a function of them needing support and assistance. And in  this way, mutually, we've been able to help each other. Where we've wanted to cut off the  [indistinct] of the past, which we've successfully done. So they've helped us a lot, actually.   

 JOURNALIST:  Are you aware of how many asylum seekers [indistinct] still on Nauru.   

 DOWNER: I would have to get that number for you. The number is much, much lower than it  was a few years ago. The numbers have come down substantially.  Because, as you know,  there haven't been any, almost no new boats [indistinct] people. And partly that's because of  the arrangements we have [indistinct].   

 JOURNALIST:  [Indistinct] the leadership [indistinct].   

 DOWNER: Are you talking about the Woodward book? Well, I haven't read the Woodward  book. But, just to say to you, I'll be getting a copy of it.  They made an official announcement.  In early 2003 when they made the official announcement, was when I absolutely knew.  Though, remember, there was an enormous build-up of American forces in the Persian Gulf,  for some period of time.  No final decision had been made on them going to war. If you go, I  can rephrase your question for you, if you like. At what point did I think that the Americans  were giving consideration to the option of military action against Iraq. Now, that is a different  from the very literal question you put to me. The answer to which is, March, I suppose, 2003.    But, in terms of them giving consideration to the option of military action, I can remember,  very clearly, Madeleine Albright talking to me about that in about 1998. When I met with her,  I think, from memory, in Bangkok.  This wasn't something that was peculiar to the Bush  Administration. The Clinton Administration were talking about the same thing, to me, back in  1998.   

 QUESTION:  Would you say [indistinct] … plans … [indistinct] before invasion [indistinct]?   

 DOWNER:  I haven't read the book, I'd have to have a look at the book. When they finally  made the decision to go to war, look, I'd have to check when I first heard of that. I guess so  that would have been around the time it happened though. I mean, the President finally made  the decision I guess, in March.   

 QUESTION:  [Indistinct]   

 DOWNER: I don't recall being told that they'd made that decision two months earlier. I just  learned that through the Woodward book. I have to read the book, you know. I think I'll get it  and have a look at it.   

 QUESTION:  [Indistinct] book--   

 DOWNER:  If I can get one [indistinct] a big seller [indistinct].

 QUESTION:  Indistinct] East Timor on the maritime boundary. What do you think can come  out of those in East Timor's [indistinct]?   

 DOWNER:  Well it's a negotiation. I mean, it'll take a good deal of time. We had a long  negotiation with Indonesia over maritime boundaries and we have a … now an agreed  maritime boundary which covers several thousand kilometres [indistinct] Indonesia. So that  is … out of those negotiations also emerged the so-called Timor Gap negotiations between  my predecessor Gareth Evans and Ali Alitas, the former Foreign Minister of Indonesia, and  we've made an arrangement now with East Timor under the Timor Sea Treaty, and also we've  agreed to a unitisation agreement on the Greater Sunrise Field, and we expect those  agreements on the one hand, to be fully honourably implemented, and on the other we've said  that we would conclude those agreements without prejudice to further negotiations on  maritime boundaries and we're -- as we promised we would -- implementing that process.   

 QUESTION:  [Indistinct] come out of [indistinct].   

 DOWNER:  Oh well this is going to be a negotiation that will take a good deal of time, to  discuss what the legal parameters are, we have to have a look at what claims they might be  making and measure them against our own claims. This isn't a process that you'd resolve in  two-day talks. I mean, that would be out of the question, nobody would expect that. They  wouldn't expect that.   

 QUESTION:  [Indistinct] do you mean how long [indistinct]?   

 DOWNER:  Well I don't know. As long -- to use a phrase -- as long as is necessary to get the  job done.   

 QUESTION:  [Indistinct]   

 DOWNER: No, certainly not. No.   

 QUESTION:  [Indistinct]   

 DOWNER:  Well, they get 90, we get ten. It's not a bad split from their point of view.   

 QUESTION:  What's your response to claims [indistinct]?   

 DOWNER: Oh well it's part of the negotiating process. They see it as a useful way of  strengthening their negotiating hand by accusing us of being bullying and aggressive and you  know, you just listening to me now and I'm absolutely calm and reasonable and just hear what  they have to say and we'll participate in the negotiating process as best we know how as well.  We have our own way of negotiating, which mainly isn't public. Theirs is more public, they  like to negotiate publicly [indistinct] privately. We're private people, us Australians.   

 QUESTION:  Mr. Downer, Robert Mugabe has described the Commonwealth as an evil  organisation and says he doesn't want to rejoin it, so what's your response to that?   

 DOWNER:  Well I don't want Robert Mugabe in the Commonwealth. I would like a liberal  democratic government of Zimbabwe in the Commonwealth. I have to say I think Robert  Mugabe has been one of the most disastrous Presidents that Africa has seen in a very long

 time. He has destroyed the economic bases of Zimbabwe to the extent now that we provide  food aid his people because of the abominable policies his Government has pursued.  He's  trashed many of the institutions of democracy which were established through the Lancaster  House Process, and we played an important part in making it possible for Zimbabwe to  become a liberal democratic state. I think his time in office is way, way over. He's been there  too long, and he's done too much damage for him to be able to make a valuable contribution.  It doesn't matter what he thinks about the Commonwealth, it's what the Zimbabwean people  think about their daily lives, which is something he should be focusing on.   

 QUESTION:  So there's no chance that under Robert Mugabe Zimbabwe would be allowed  back in?   

 DOWNER:  Well, I don’t … you've made the point he doesn't want to come back, and he  won't apply, and if he applied to come back he'd have a lot of trouble getting back in. He  wouldn't … there wouldn't be a consensus for Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe to go back into the  Commonwealth, but with a democratic government, I think there'd be … a new democratic  government in Zimbabwe there'd be great enthusiasm about having Zimbabwe back. One day  I look forward to welcoming Zimbabwe back to the family of democracies and to the  Commonwealth.   

 QUESTION:  In your opinion, how bad is the financial situation in Nauru? Are they  terminally bankrupt?   

 DOWNER:  Their financial situation is difficult and we're working that through with them.
