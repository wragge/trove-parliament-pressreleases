 Senator Andrew Bartlett   Leader of the Australian Democrats  Spokesperson for Immigration  27 May 2003                          MEDIA RELEASE                                   03/368                

 

 25 Reports on Detention Centres, but the Horrors remain   

 Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock will not get away with shaking off the latest allegations of the  maltreatment of asylum seekers, the Australian Democrats said today.    

 Democrats’ Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said Mr Ruddock could not continue to blame others  for the harm people are suffering whilst under his care.    

 Senator Bartlett said the Four Corners allegations aired last week were just the latest in a long list of  complaints about mandatory detention.   

 And now the Commonwealth Ombudsman has initiated its own inquiry into conditions at  immigration detention centres.   

 “There have been more than 25 reports and investigations just in last few years revealing the huge  damage being done to children and adults in detention centres,” Senator Bartlett said.   

 “The reports come from Parliament, our Human Rights Commission, medical specialists, the United  Nations, and independent inquiries.   

 “Every single one of these reports highlights the trauma, despair and human rights abuses that occur  in detention centres.  Every report adds to the case for stopping the policy of mandatory detention of  all asylum seekers.   

 “If these human rights abuses occurred in any other sector, like schools or prisons or hospitals, the  Minister would be held accountable.  It is outrageous that Mr Ruddock continues to hide behind  contracts and inflexible policy as a reason for his failure to carry out his duties.    

 “We need to ensure that we focus not only on past events in Woomera but the ongoing situation  facing people still in detention today.    

 “Self-harm is part of the epidemic of despair within detention centres.     

 “Some people are no longer attempting to draw attention to themselves, they have simply given up.  The result is stress levels so high that they are physically shutting down.     

 “In Baxter there is a detainee who has gone blind due to stress. Children have stopped eating and  people are suffering mental health issues that will last for the rest of their lives.    

  “Asylum seekers and refugees are not criminals, they are not dangerous.  The inhumane treatment  they are receiving has to stop.”
