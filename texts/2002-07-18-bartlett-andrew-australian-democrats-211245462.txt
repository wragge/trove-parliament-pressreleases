 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 18 July 2002  MEDIA RELEASE                          02/367

 Young detainees seek protection from DIMA by applying for asylum at the British Embassy Australians should be ashamed that young asylum seekers have been forced to seek assistance from the British Embassy because of their treatment in Australia, say the Australian Democrats.  

 Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Democrats’ spokesperson for Immigration, says he’s not surprised at the news that child asylum seekers, who have escaped from the hostile conditions in Woomera, have sought asylum at the British Embassy.  

 “Given the conditions in Woomera it was only a matter of time before this happened,” Senator Bartlett said.  

 “It has been documented over and over again that children should not be kept in detention and that Australia’s policies are actually harming children. The evidence is there.  

 “This will see Australia facing greater international scrutiny due to the sad plight of these children. And deservedly so,” Senator Bartlett said.  

 Senator Bartlett said this case was a tragic example of the Minister’s determination to separate families.  

 “Minister Ruddock has set out to deliberately separate families and inflict further pain on people who had legitimate claims to asylum.  

 “These children have a father living in the community due to the fact that his claim for refugee status has been recognised by the Department, and yet this same Department has refused to allow their mother and their three young sisters refugee status.  

 “Clearly this is a cruel and inhumane way of dealing with a sad situation. No other country in the western world would consider treating people in this way. Yet, we do,” Senator Bartlett said.  

 Senator Bartlett is currently in Europe investigating the treatment of asylum seekers.  

 “Other countries are embarrassed and ashamed if they have to keep children in detention longer than six days,” Senator Bartlett said.  

 “Minister Ruddock has repeatedly misled the Australian public when he’s discussed international reaction to our treatment of asylum seekers. The majority of international organisations including government agencies do not support what we are doing on any level,” Senator Bartlett concluded.  

 The Australian Democrats are calling on the British Embassy to seriously consider the children’s application and to offer these children a genuine solution.
