 CAMBODIAN BOAT PEOPLE LITIGATION

 On my return to Canberra this evening, information was  brought to my attention about a defect in the process  followed in the later stages of decisions made on 37  Cambodians who had asked for refugee status.

 This situation emerged during the course of consultations  between the Department and Counsel who is appearing for me  in a hearing set down for tomorrow in Darwin.

 I have instructed Counsel that I do not wish to defend a  case where there was any doubt about the scrupulous fairness  of the process.

 I have therefore directed the Department to carry out the  final stages of the decision making again.

 There have been a number of requests for me to intervene. I  am determined not to interfere in the merits of these cases  and this makes it all the more important that the processes  employed by the Department are beyond reproach.

 As the matter is still before the Court I will not be making  any further comment.
