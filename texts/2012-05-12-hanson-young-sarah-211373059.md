 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Greens urge govt stop destroying  families and change ASIO Act   

 

 The Australian Greens have today urged the federal government to change the ASIO Act  after revelations another family has been torn apart and faces indefinite detention even  though they have been granted refugee protection.   

 "The Greens were deeply upset by last night's Lateline story on a young Sri Lankan woman  and her two sons who have been removed from Melbourne to Villawood detention centre,"  Greens' immigration spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, said.   

 "Australia authorities found they were refugees and gave them shelter for the past year, but  suddenly decided to detain them before they could even say goodbye to their family and  friends.   

 "They are among almost 50 people, including several children, who are being detained  indefinitely because they cannot challenge their ASIO adverse security assessments.   

 "Australia cannot claim to be the land of the fair go if, like Ranjini and her sons have found,  you cannot appeal against an ASIO assessment, nor found out why the assessment was  imposed.   

 "The Greens urge the government to immediately review Ranjini's case and act on the  recommendations of the Joint Select Committee into Australia's Immigration Detention  Network to bring basic procedural fairness to the way these ASIO assessments operate.   

 "We again call on the Attorney-General and the government to respond to the committee's  recommendations, because we are denying justice to refugees by refusing to let them appeal  adverse security assessments."
