 INDUSTRIAL ACTION. PREVENTS. MIGRANT. .CLASSES. AT FAIRFIELD

 Industrial action by the NSW Teachers' Federation against 

 the Migrant Settlement and Education Centre at Fairfield will 

 prevent the provision of English classes to a large number of 

 newly-arrived refugees and migrants in that area.

 There has been rapid growth in the numbers of non-English 

 speaking migrants and refugees settling in the Fairfield region 

 over recent years. Earlier this year the Commonwealth Government, 

 in co-operation with the Fairfield City Council,  acted quickly to 

 meet the special needs of newcomers by establishing a Migrant 

 Settlement and Education Centre in the area. The Centre opened 

 on 17 July 1981 and is already providing some settlement services 

 to migrants.

 However,  the NSW Teachers' Federation has not allowed 

 teachers to provide English language classes at the Centre,  thus 

 preventing it from assisting newly-arrived migrants in over­

 coming one of the most serious settlement problems - the 

 inability to speak English.

 The administration of the Adult Migrant Education Program 

 has to be kept as flexible as possible to ensure that language 

 services for migrants are located where needs exist and that 

 course content is adjusted to meet the changing special requirements 

 of newly-arrived migrants.

 The industrial action by the Teachers' Federation prevents 

 this.  ·
