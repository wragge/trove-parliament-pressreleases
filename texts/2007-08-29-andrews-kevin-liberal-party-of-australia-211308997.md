 Kevin Andrews MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 

 DIAC outreach officers to visit New England 

 Wednesday, 29 August 2007 

 Officers from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) will be in  Tamworth and Armidale soon for a regional outreach visit. 

 Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Kevin Andrews said the outreach trips  were a great way for people in regional areas to sit down and talk about  immigration-related issues face-to-face with DIAC officers. 

 'The Australian Government places great importance on providing services to  regional areas and these visits are a large part of that,' Mr Andrews said. 

 'These appointments attract a range of people, from small business owners to  farmers, community groups to individuals, who might want information or just  someone to talk them through a complex matter. 

 'While the department has a great deal of information available over the  phone or on the Internet, some people prefer to speak to officers face-to-face,  and these visits are about meeting that need.  

 'In the past, the most popular topics related to citizenship, work visas, visas  for family members and how to propose and sponsor refugees,' the Minister  added. 

 The DIAC team will be at the at the Armidale Dumaresq Council offices at 135  Rusden Street, Armidale on Tuesday, September 4 and at the offices of Tony  Windsor MP at 5/259 Peel Street, Tamworth on Wednesday, September 5.  Consultations at both venues will take place from 9am to 4.30pm. Bookings  can be made by calling 8861 4101.
