 Stern climate costs report exposes PM Howard's  economic ineptitude 

 Senator Milne, Monday, 30th October 2006 

 The Stern report on the economic costs of failing to address climate change has  exposed Prime Minister John Howard's economic ineptitude, the Australian Greens  said today. 

 The British government commissioned report by former World Bank economist Sir  Nicholas Stern, to be released later today, finds that the world needs to spend around 1  per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP) to address climate change now or  risk climate chaos precipitating a global depression with 200 million refugees. 

 Greens climate change spokesperson Senator Christine Milne said the report stood in  stark contrast to the stubborn refusal of the Howard government to take climate  change seriously. 

 "The report leaves Prime Minister Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello exposed,"  Senator Milne said in Canberra. 

 "The May Budget failed to recognise climate change and the drought as risks to the  economy and only two months ago, Prime Minister Howard was staring down global  scientific opinion, saying he would not commit Australia to making deep greenhouse  emission cuts because it would cost jobs. 

 "The Stern report supports several Australian studies that show that acting to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions now will cost far less than the consequences of not acting.  

 "Prime Minister Howard and Treasurer Costello say that addressing climate change  will destroy the economy. In fact, it is the other way around. 

 "The Howard government has spent a decade refusing to take climate change  seriously, fiddling at the margins and relying on voluntary measures which have failed  to rein in Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, exposing our unique ecosystems and  wildlife to extinction. 

 "With just 10-15 years left to prevent catastrophic, irreversible climate change, the  government must now admit it has been wrong and implement measures that will  make a real difference, starting with a national greenhouse gas reduction target, a  system of national energy efficiency targets, lifting the Mandatory Renewable Energy 

 Target and putting a price on carbon."
