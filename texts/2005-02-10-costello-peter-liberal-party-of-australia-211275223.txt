 Doorstop Interview 

 Senate Courtyard 

 Parliament House

 Thursday, 10 February 2005 

 12 noon

 SUBJECTS: Labour force figures, industrial relations, asylum seekers, Xstrata

 TREASURER:

 In the month of January 44,500 new jobs were created in Australia and 24½ thousand of those were full-time. More 

 Australians are in work than ever before. And our unemployment rate at 5.1 per cent, that continues to be the lowest we 

 have had in 28 years. There were some other good features about today’s jobs news. The participation rate was very 

 strong and what that indicates is that more people are participating in looking for work and finding it and you have heard 

 me bang on and on about participation and how we need to increase participation, these figures are very welcome. And we 

 have also passed another milestone. Since the Government’s election in 1996 there have now been 1.5 million new jobs 

 created in Australia, so we have passed the 1.5 million mark which is another great milestone for Australia and people 

 looking for work.

 But with 44,500 new jobs created in January, with unemployment continuing at the lowest levels in 28 years, this means 

 that job prospects for Australians are better than ever before, more Australians are in work that ever before and that will 

 be welcome news for the families of Australia.

 JOURNALIST:

 How low can the unemployment rate go?

 TREASURER:

 Well, back in the early 1990s, the OECD said unemployment could go as low as 7 per cent in a full employment economy 

 and we are now at 5.1 per cent. If we can keep the rate low and increase participation that would actually be a good thing 

 because what it would mean is we are drawing more people into looking for work. And I have been hammering this point 

 about participation for quite some time that we have to try and encourage more people to participate, we have seen 

 welcome news that more people are participating and it may well be that the reason they are participating is that their 

 prospects have never been as good so we have got to keep working here.

 JOURNALIST:

 You have also been hammering industrial relations very hard especially this week, how far should the changes go and in 

 particular do you think the Government now should vigorously pursue through the corporations power, a unified industrial 

 relations system?

 TREASURER:

 I think a uniform industrial relations system would be a very welcome reform in Australia, very welcome.

 JOURNALIST:

 So should the Government pursue it through the corporations power?

 TREASURER:

 Well we should pursue it with the powers that are available to us, including the corporations power - there might be some 

 others - and we should…

 JOURNALIST:

 External powers?

 TREASURER:

 …and we should do it as a matter of priority. How far should industrial relations reform go? It should go substantive, it 

 should go for substantive change for instance substantive improvement. You see, the issue now of course is where you are 

 getting low unemployment as we are, what we have to make sure is this doesn’t spill across into wage demands, which are 

 not based on productivity. Because if that spills into wage demands which are not based on productivity, which are not 

 sustainable, you will get pressure on your inflation rates. So we need a new round of industrial relations reform which can 

 boost productivity in Australia.

 JOURNALIST:

 So allowable matters down to four or five?

 TREASURER:

 Reducing allowable matters, increasing…

 JOURNALIST:

 ..down to four of five?

 TREASURER:

 …contracts, ease of entry into the labour force, flexibility in relation to hiring and firing, flexibility in relation to hours 

 and conditions, flexibility has got to be the hallmark of a modern society in the 21 st century.

 JOURNALIST:

 Should there be some sort of special conference involving the states and unions and business and so on to reach some sort 

 of accord?

 TREASURER:

 Well you know the States can, one of the ways you can get a unified system is if the States hand over powers and the 

 Victorian Government did that under the previous administration so I would certainly welcome any state that was 

 prepared to follow that lead, that would be the simplest and easiest way to get to a unified system.

 JOURNALIST:

 Treasurer do you have any concerns over the administration over the $100 million regional partnerships programme?

 TREASURER:

 Well I think it is important that the programmes be administered well and there be full accountability and I think there is. 

 At the end of the day the reason we have departments and the reason the departments put conditions and the reason 

 departments engage in these matters is to ensure that there is accountability and I believe there is.

 JOURNALIST:

 What is your reading on how tight the labour market actually is, we have seen a lot of, you know economists have been 

 talking about this for a while but what is your view?

 TREASURER:

 Well I think that there are areas where it is particularly tight, I have said this, skills obviously. If you speak to the mining 

 companies, for example, that are doing investments they find it hard to get skilled labour. That has been particularly a 

 problem I think in say the energy and electricity areas. So some areas are tighter than others. I shouldn’t just say skills by 

 the way, if you speak to the stone fruit growers of the Goulburn Valley they will say there is a shortage of un-skilled 

 labour too. These are all problems, but they are the problems you want to have, believe me…

 JOURNALIST:

 Treasurer…

 TREASURER:

 …I mean the problems of a 5 per cent unemployment rate are much better than the problems of an 11 per cent 

 unemployment rate. I would rather have a situation where there are jobs to go for those that want to work rather than a lot 

 of workers with no jobs to go into.

 JOURNALIST:

 Are you worried about a public sector wage explosion when you consider that in Queensland for example, power workers 

 were recently given 10 per cent a year for the next three years?

 TREASURER:

 Well, I can’t believe that a 30 per cent wage increase over three years can be backed up by productivity improvements and 

 can be sustainable. I can’t believe it. And what is the problem of that? Well the problem of that is if other employers see 

 that and say, ‘we have to get into this business too,’ and start matching it. That would be a problem and I think that it is 

 important that the State Governments show a bit of leadership in this area.

 JOURNALIST:

 I suppose Queensland for example they will just, the public sector unions will just use the 10 per cent as their starting 

 claim for their next negotiation.

 TREASURER:

 If people were to lodge flow-on applications and if those applications were to be granted that would be a problem, 

 absolutely. Look, we can afford to create more jobs, we can afford to have real wage increases, we can do all of that, as 

 long as it is based on productivity. But if you get a situation where large increases are being paid out and it is not based on 

 productivity improvements, something will break.

 JOURNALIST:

 Have you spoken to your state Liberal counterparts about your industrial reform agenda? Do they support a unified 

 framework?

 TREASURER:

 Well I am sure that they would support improvements, I haven’t asked, the answer is no, I haven’t spoken to them 

 individually.

 JOURNALIST:

 Do you have any view on the remarks made by Petro Georgiou this week about asylum seekers? Do you think that there is 

 a case for a change of Government policy?

 TREASURER:

 Look, my view is that the fewer illegal arrivals in Australia the fewer people are going to be in detention centres. And 

 there are far fewer people in detention centres today when they were first introduced.

 JOURNALIST:

 But you have got one man who has been there for more than six years. Is that fair?

 TREASURER:

 Now, you know, if you can stop the flow of illegals into Australia, numbers in detention centres will decline and that is in 

 fact what has been happening. Now, you now, far from this being a reason to change policy on illegal entrants, I think it is 

 actually a reason to continue it. That is that you can keep your numbers down, you can avoid the hardship that is involved 

 in that, if the people who are prepared to pay smugglers are dissuaded from trying in the first place.

 JOURNALIST:

 So you are not concerned with a man who has spent more than six years, who can’t be deported because the other 

 countries won’t take him, you are not concerned about that?

 TREASURER:

 Look, we should always be interested in people’s rights, but if the implication of your question is, do I think that the 

 illegal arrival policy is wrong or should be changed, my answer is no.

 JOURNALIST:

 What do you think we should do with this man?

 TREASURER:

 Look, in relation to people that are in detention, first of all arrangements should be sought with the countries involved to 

 see if they can be returned, where they can resume their lives, that is what you are trying to do in situations like this. You 

 know, let’s be honest about this. A lot of people fled Afghanistan to get away from the tyranny of the Taliban. The 

 wonderful thing now that the Taliban has been deposed is that you can live a safe and much better life in Afghanistan. 

 You know, actually improving conditions in some of these countries is the most positive contribution that you can make.

 JOURNALIST:

 What do you make of Mr Georgiou’s idea to offer a one-off amnesty to temporary protection visa holders?

 TREASURER:

 Look, people are entitled to put forward their own views and we respect their own views. But I actually think that the 

 policy as it has been applied, particularly in dissuading illegal entrants from trying to enter Australia illegally in the first 

 place, has been successful. 

 JOURNALIST:

 Mr Costello, the Trade Minister this morning indicated that he would like to see conditions put on Xstrata’s bid for WMC 

 which ensure that the company develops uranium assets in (inaudible) Australia’s interests. And furthermore he said that 

 he has raised it with you personally, what is your response to that?

 TREASURER:

 Look, at the end of the day, can I make this point, this is a decision for the Treasurer under a statute. The wonderful thing 

 about everybody else’s position is they don’t have to make the decision, the difference for me is that I do. Can I say to you 

 I have to make this decision under a statute. I have to carefully apply a statute. I have to afford natural justice, I have to 

 direct myself to the matters that the statute prescribes. And if I don’t do that I don’t properly exercise those powers. So I 

 will be doing that and when I have properly directed my mind to all of the things that I am required to by law, after I have 

 made the decision, I will announce it and I will explain it. But until that happens I am not going to have a running 

 commentary on the outcome of my decision. Besides anything else, parties would say that I have prejudiced my hearing or 

 that they haven’t had natural justice.

 JOURNALIST:

 Is this debate making your decision harder?

 TREASURER:

 I am a pretty robust person. Thank you very much.
