 In answer to a question on notice by Senator Kerry Nettle the government has revealed that the  immigration department has spent nearly one million dollars to guard asylum seekers who have  been transferred from Baxter Immigration Detention Facility to Glenside psychiatric hospital.    

 "The immigration department spent ten times what it spent on psychiatric care at Glenside  hospital on providing guards for mentally ill detainees in the last financial year to May. This  shocking statistic underlines the warped priorities that the department and minister have in  relation to the health of those in their care," Senator Nettle said.    

 "The Glenside guards bill for the last financial year to May was $961,000 nearly ten times the  $105,000 paid to South Australian Health for the health services at Glenside hospital for  detainees.    

 "There was no need to have these guards at Glenside which is a secure mental health facility, but  still the government wasted a million dollars on providing up to 42 guards to monitor detainees.    

 "The department has now changed its guarding policy.    

 "The Baxter Immigration Detention Facility and the policy of indefinite mandatory detention is  making detainees mentally ill, and until this policy is changed the tax payer will continue to foot  the bill for their treatment."
