 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 29 January 2002  MEDIA RELEASE                          02/028

 Refugee detention crisis - time for the Government to listen The Government’s unwillingness to heed the concerns expressed about its asylum seeker policy has led to the current damaging situation in our detention centres, say the Australian Democrats.

 The Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett said, “there are many solutions; people have been providing advice to the Government for years, but the Government’s refusal to listen is about playing politics - it’s not about achieving good outcomes for Australia and the refugees”.

 “Minister Ruddock’s latest reluctance to finding constructive solutions to this problem can be seen by his refusal to act on the advice of his own Immigration Detention Advisory Group (IDAG).

 “IDAG’s call to close Woomera Detention Centre mirrors calls repeatedly made by the Democrats.”

 Senator Bartlett continued, “While more suitable facilities are yet to be completed, there are existing facilities available such as those used for the Kosovo refugees, which could be used to house the refugees.

 “Mayor of Brighton in Southern Tasmania, Cr Tony Foster, has also indicated that his Council is willing to house up to 700 people. A number of community groups, with expertise in helping asylum seekers, have also offered to assist in housing and caring for refugees while their claims are assessed.”

 “Yet, the Government ignores these offers, it is more interested in looking tough than in finding a workable solution. There have been many warnings leading up to this point, the majority of which the Government has ignored.  These include:   ! Human Rights Commission’s reports highlighting problems with the policy of mandatory detention. ! Repeated concerns expressed by the United Nations’ High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR). ! A Democrats’ initiated Senate Inquiry into the refugee determination system, which contains

  recommendations supported by Democrat, Liberal and Labor Senators, and Senator Harradine. ! A Joint Parliamentary Committee Report containing concerns and recommendations regarding detention centres, which was supported by the Democrats, Liberal and Labor, and Senator Harradine.

  “Further frustrations for Australia’s detainees come from the fact that New Zealand has processed 170 people from The Tampa. Not surprisingly they want to know why Australia isn’t able to do the same.

  “Detainees also know that Minister Ruddock has frequently raised antagonism toward them, with claims like asylum seekers are just making a ‘lifestyle choice’.  It is, therefore, not surprising that many of them are concerned that their claims will not be fairly assessed,” said Senator Bartlett.

  “The Government seeks to deceive Australians when it says there are no alternatives - there are many. The Howard Government must investigate these alternatives, and commit to expeditiously processing all refugee applications, which will ensure an end to this current situation,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
