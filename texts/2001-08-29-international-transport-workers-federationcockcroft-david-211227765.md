  David Cockroft comments on the case of the 
ship Tampa

  

 Commenting on the case of the ship Tampa, which has 
been boarded by Australian troops, ITF General Secretary David Cockroft 
said: "We understand the difficult position the Australian Government 
finds itself in, but ask it to face up to its urgent humanitarian duty. 
That means allowing the Tampa to proceed to Christmas Island. Until 
that happens the crew are being put at an unacceptable risk - as are 
the asylum seekers and the ship itself.

  

 "Any other course of action would set a terrible 
precedent by risking a situation where crews would feel unable to pick 
up anyone in distress at sea. That is almost too frightening to contemplate.

  

 "The Australian Government cannot put seafarers 
in the position of having to decide who is a refugee and who is an economic 
migrant. Seafarers have to be free to help those in distress and leave 
such questions to national authorities.

  

 "The ITF unreservedly condemns the horrible trade 
in human lives and - whether or not it was the case here - the appalling 
practice by of sinking people-smuggling boats when a ship comes in sight. 
Our call to the Australian Government to accept this ship does not absolve 
the Indonesian Government of the duty to police its waters and crack 
down on this horrible trade. The Australian Government will be fully 
justified in expecting Indonesia's full co-operation in tracking down 
the people responsible.

  

 "We also call on IMO Secretary General William 
O'Neill to use his good offices to help get this problem resolved."
