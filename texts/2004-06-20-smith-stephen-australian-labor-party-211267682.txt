 WORLD REFUGEE DAY 2004 

 

 Today ,Sunday 20 June marks the United Nations High Commission for Refugees  (UNHCR) World Refugee Day with the theme of A Place to Call Home: Rebuilding lives  in safety and dignity. 

 

 Labor encourages Australians to commemorate World Refugee Day 2004 and to  celebrate Australia’s long and proud record of resettling refugees in Australia, something  that is often under appreciated by Australians.   

 World Refugee Day 2004 celebrations will take place all over the world and the UNCHR  is supporting several celebrations across Australia.     

 Australia’s national activity plan with events and locations across the country on and  around World Refugee Day can be found on the UNHCR website at www.unhcr.ch   

 The UNHCR is again holding a national writing competition for Australian high school  students.  Labor supports the continuation of this project as an uniquely Australian  initiative and encourages high school students across the country to include the UNHCRs  Refugees: telling their stories writing competition as part of their World Refugee Day  2004 activities. 

 

 Competition guidelines are available from the UNHCR by email on aulcain5@unhcr.ch,  or by telephone on (02) 6290 1355.
