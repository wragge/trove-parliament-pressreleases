 Senator Sarah HansonâYoung   Australian Greens

 Govt must prove Malaysian option is legal: Greens  The Australian Government must publish the legal advice to prove that its plan to dump 800 asylum  seekers on Malaysia is legal, the Australian Greens said today. 

 “We know that this plan breaches international law, so the burden is now on the government to prove  it complies with the Migration Act,” the Greens spokesperson for immigration, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, said. 

 “The Prime Minister says her government does not need legislation for the Malaysian solution,  because she is relying on John Howard’s Tampa legislation that Labor has never repealed. 

 “Section 198A of the act states there are four things the Immigration Minister must prove for an  ‘offshore entry person who may be taken to a declared country,” she said. 

 These include that it: (i)  provides access, for persons seeking asylum, to effective procedures for  assessing their need for protection;  

 (ii)  provides protection for persons seeking asylum, pending determination of their refugee status; 

 (iii)  provides protection to persons who are given refugee status, pending their voluntary repatriation  to their country of origin or resettlement in another country;  

 and (iv)  meets relevant human rights standards in providing that protection. 

 “The Government is content to send asylum seekers to a country condemned for its appalling human  right standards, a place where such people are considered illegal and can be caned,” Sen. Hanson-Young said. 

 “My question to the Prime Minister is where is the proof that this impending measure is legal.”
