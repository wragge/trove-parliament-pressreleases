 LAURIE FERGUSON MP            SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR REID  20 MAY 2005 

 

 Vanstone - Moving Goalposts   

 “The statement yesterday by the Immigration Minister that regulations introduced  in 1994 and 1996 might have exacerbated problems over deportations and  detentions has value, but is only part of the problem.”    It also seems to try to  move blame.”  Shadow Immigration Minister, Laurie Ferguson stated. 

 

 “The reality is that DIMIA staff do actually have the discretion to issue a bridging  visa E in virtually all situations.  I would also note that until this point the Minister  has not been too forthcoming about the details and specifics saying that Mick  Palmer will reveal all.”   

 “Now, there is an inference that DIMIA staff in some of these situations might  have had forebodings and doubts and that with more leeway disastrous  outcomes could have been avoided.”  Mr Ferguson further noted.   

 “The section 189 power requires “reasonable cause to suspect someone is  unlawful.”  It is not an open door for detentions and deportations.  The essential  problem is a culture from the top which has diminished the need for caution and  analysis.  Hiding behind “privacy” and the “Palmer Inquiry” only exacerbates that  trend.”  Mr Ferguson asserted   

 “The point is that a secretive, limited powers inquiring will not reduce grave  concerns over the whole process.  Premier Beattie last night reiterated the need  for a Royal Commission, volunteering full Queensland Police and Government  cooperation.  That’s the course of action Minister Vanstone and John Howard  should pursue.  Otherwise how are we to judge the interplay of tragic error,  ineptitude, lack of discretion etc.?”
