 Media Release: Greens welcome united push against offshore detention 

 February 3, 2017 

 The Greens welcome the united front from the long list of community groups and  organisations calling for immediate action on offshore detention. 

 "The situation on Manus Island and Nauru is completely untenable," Australian Greens  immigration spokesperson Senator Nick McKim said. 

 "Resettlement for any refugees in the US now looks extremely unlikely and Prime Minister  Turnbull needs to immediately close the camps and bring every man, woman and child in  offshore detention here to Australia." 

 "The Greens commend these organisations for standing up for the human rights of innocent  people that Australia has treated so disgracefully."
