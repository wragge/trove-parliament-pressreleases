 Joint Press Conference 

 Transcript, E&OE, proof only 

 Gedung Pancasila, Indonesia 

 16 July 2012 

 Marty Natalegawa: [Speaking Indonesian] 

 Bob just very quickly I would like to share with you what I have just shared with my  media colleagues here. I am really thrilled, deeply honoured and deeply appreciative  of the fact that today we are able to welcome you to Jakarta, first visit on your part to  Jakarta in your present capacity as Minister Foreign Affairs of Australia. 

 Of course we have met on a number of occasions already, not least for the 2+2  meeting that we had in Australia last March and of course on the sidelines of various  multilateral meetings, not least of which was in Phnom Penh just a few days ago. 

 I had informed the media colleagues that early this month the Prime Minister and the  President of Indonesia had met in Darwin for the second annual leaders meeting.  And of course our discussions just now, mainly among others discussed ways and  means to follow up the meeting between the Prime Minister and the President of  Indonesia, including cooperation in the cattle industry, cooperation and promotion of  infrastructure investment, people to people relations, education and not least in trade  affairs as well. 

 I reminded our colleagues we have a target of 15 billion US dollars by 2015 that we  need to work earnestly towards. And I am not pessimistic, I am not pessimistic that  we will be able to achieve those targets. 

 Apart from that of course I have mentioned to our colleagues that we have discussed  a number of standalone issues. For example, the issue of cooperation between our  two sides on search and rescue, operations at sea, the issue of Indonesian minors in  Australia and others relating to people smuggling issues and a number of other  regional issues as well. 

 That is the gist of what I have informed our colleagues from the media, especially  that later on this evening we will be having a continued discussion over number of 

 issues of common interest. With that I would like to give you the floor, Bob to say a  few words as well. 

 Bob Carr: Thanks Marty. This relationship is very important to me. My first meeting  with the Foreign Minister, just days before I sworn in as Minister, was with Marty. It  was the 2+2 meeting we had in Canberra and confirms that there is no relationship  for Australia of more importance than that we enjoy with the Republic of Indonesia. 

 We've spoken regularly in the period since March, and with the impetus of our  leader's meeting in Darwin behind us we are able to touch base on a number of  issues of significance. Our focus has been on the broad strategic relationship that  Australia and Indonesia enjoy, with cooperation on many fronts. For example, I  sought the guidance of the Minister when it came to Australia's opening to Myanmar. 

 Indonesia was at that position, forward-leaning on this issue, well ahead of us, as  were its colleagues in ASEAN. As we expand our activities with Myanmar we will be  guided by some of the advice that Indonesia can offer us and we will seek areas  where we can make sure there is a matching of our policies. 

 I explained to the Minister and his team that I'm committed to working with the  Europeans and the Americans that the language which the United Nations deals with  Myanmar is softened to take account of the progress that that country has made on  its transition towards democracy. 

 That is one example of consultation between Australia and Indonesia that has taken  place and that will echo in the future of our relationship. I am very pleased of course  when it comes to people to people links that breakthrough announced in Darwin, the  reciprocal increase in working holiday visas, has been increased from a 100 to a  1000 places a year. 

 People-to-people links are very significant. When I met members of Commission -  that is what we call in Australia the Parliamentary committee on foreign affairs -  when I met members of that committee today, I found that 4 out of 5 members of  parliament in attendance had sons or daughters in Australian universities. And in one  case, grandchildren as well in Australian universities. We want to build on that. 

 I welcome the discussion we had on the maritime cooperation. We focused on some  search and rescue issues, and we will work with Indonesia's search and rescue  agency to help strengthen its ability to communicate with merchant vessels during  safety of life at sea incidents and will explore an exchange program of search and  rescue specialists. 

 I give credit to Indonesia for combating people smuggling, shown by its disruption of  a very large number of ventures and we underline the importance of a Bali process  and regional cooperation in combating human trafficking and people smuggling. 

 Two-way trade with Indonesia actually went up 15 per cent in the last year. The  Indonesian economy is expected to double in the next 10 years; we are on the cusp  of a huge expansion in our economic ties, propelled forward by Indonesian economic  growth as the Indonesian economy travels as projected, as the Indonesian economy  expands, grows, matures, the linkages between us will expand as well. 

 And in that context we look forward to the start in October this year of ministerial-level discussions around the economic, the strategic-economic cooperation agenda.  That is very important for both countries and it builds on the free trade agreement  involving ASEAN, Australia and NZ. Plenty to talk about, I might leave it there. 

 Marty Natalegawa: Any questions? 

 Question: Pak Marty we heard from the Australian Parliament recently that in the  nine months to April, 97 refugee visas were issued by Australia through the Jakarta  Embassy. In your view is this enough to stop 1000's of Asylum seekers getting on  fishing boats from here and my question to Mr Carr, has the Australian government  had any serious discussions with the Indonesian government recently about the  paltry number of visa available to refuges here. 

 Marty Natalegawa: Well I am not going to enter into a numbers issue so to speak;  what is enough and what is not enough. What is more important for us is really invest  in the Infrastructure in the structure of our collaboration cooperation. I must say over  the years notwithstanding the various debates on how best to approach the entire  challenge of irregular movement of people or people smuggling. 

 In the final analysis we all come back to the recognition that the Bali process that we  have been promoting bilaterally, Indonesia-Australia, namely the national, the  bilateral and the regional, especially including the origin transit and destination  approach, is one that has stood the test of time. 

 Of course there is always room and potential for further enhancement. But I think the  basic approach has been a sound one. As I said before, I am not going to enter into  what is meant to be a good number or an insufficient number, because there is not a  one size fits all. What I will, and have been looking for, and I am quite satisfied by  where we are just now, Indonesia and Australia have made it their common  responsibility, their common objective in promoting a regional approach in solving  this issue. 

 Just recently we are establishing an office in Bangkok, regional support office in  Bangkok under the Bali process mechanism, which further strengthens the approach  that I have mentioned just now. So I am not going to second guess what is  appropriate and not appropriate but I want to acknowledge the fact that between  Indonesia and Australia we have a system in place in addressing these kinds of  issues. 

 Bob Carr: My concern is the pressure on Indonesia would be greatly alleviated if the  Australian Parliament approved the Malaysian arrangement. I have said repeatedly  that without the Malaysian arrangement we are left with an improvised Indonesian  solution, which puts too much pressure on Indonesia. It is something Indonesia  doesn't want. It is something Indonesia hasn't sought. And the way of breaking the  business model of people smugglers is to ensure that there is processing in  Malaysia. 

 Malaysia has agreed to it, Malaysia continues to adhere to it. We want it to happen.  We want it to be the disincentive to people smugglers enticing people to give up  thousands of their dollars to take a risk at sea. It's unsafe, it's inhumane. The  alternative is to secure offshore processing in Malaysia. And I would just like to  repeat my call for the Australian Parliament to approve that. Without that offshore  processing we are left with a solution that is improvised, untidy, inhumane. 

 Question: Today the opposition in Australia have said that the UN refugee  convention is outdated and was written for a bygone era. Do you agree that more  work needs to be done on it, a new convention needs to be drawn up? 

 Bob Carr: I think that's a distraction by the opposition, if I can be partisan while I am  outside of Australia. Try to talk me out of doing that if it's appropriate. 

 But I think the immediate question for the opposition is to approve offshore  processing according to the Malaysian arrangement. To open up a debate about  reviewing the UN convention, well that is an argument for another day. The  immediate challenge for Tony Abbot and his colleagues is to tick off the Malaysian  arrangement, which will bust the business model of people smugglers and create a  huge disincentive for people risking their lives at sea. 

 Question: With respect, you started the Bali process which indicates that you do  need another process or another sort of agreement other than the UN convention. If I  could get you to respond to that, but also to Mr Natelwagawa, have you been  satisfied too with our Minister's response or undertaking to you about Indonesian  minors imprisoned in Australia. 

 Marty Natalegawa: Although it was addressed to the Minister on the first issue, I  think we should do away with the assumption or the perception as if there is mutually  exclusive approach, either the global approach, the regional or the bilateral or even  the national approach. 

 We have always felt that the Bali process type of efforts in a good way brings all the  best potential from the different layers or different levels. The national approach, the  regional, bilateral, and global as well, as long as they are working in synergy with  one another and not cancelling one another out, there is room for us to be really  complementing our efforts. 

 Indonesia on our part are doing our best to disrupt the people smuggling operations  at the national levels. But always this cannot be done on its own at the national  levels. It must be supplemented, it must be strengthened by a bilateral, regional and  global approach as well. 

 On the issue of minors, obviously this is still a pending issue with we still have a  certain number of Indonesian national minors in Australia at the immigration centres.  We have been informed just now, when we discussed this just now, ways and  means to have relatively reliable figures that matches one another's data. 

 We have certain numbers that we are basing our representation on. The Australian  government has a certain number as well. But we resolve to have a certain modality  where we can ascertain exactly in a relatively reliable way, the number of minors  involved and then have a certain process to ascertain their actual age. 

 I must say that since November 2011, when the issue was first given special  attention by the Australian Government, by the Prime Minister, by the Minister, we  have now a far better way of addressing the issue than in comparison to the past. 

 But until, of course we wish very much as the President has said before when he  was in Darwin, to have this particular portfolio addressed in a good way. And at the  same time, working to ensure that we prevent—prevention is as important—we  prevent a recurrence of a similar situation in the future. 

 Question: You talk about disrupting the people smuggling operations here in  Indonesia, but could more be done, is there more scope to stepping that up, and  more controls of the coast line? 

 Marty Natalegawa: Absolutely, look at Indonesia's geography, 17,000 islands, it is  very porous. I guess for those perpetrators or the mastermind behind people  smuggling, they find the conditions in Indonesia feasible or conducive for them to  continue their operations. 

 But we are doing our level best at a national level, working together with Australia  and other friendly countries to disrupt in a serious way their operations. But I wanted  to emphasis since most of the questions have been on people smuggling as Bob has  said before, our relations is a comprehensive one, is a strategic one. He had  mentioned our cooperation on Myanmar, for example, on some other issues this  must not be ignored, that we have not only important bilateral relations, but also we  are working very closely on a number of global regional issues. 

 Bob Carr: I think, I if may able to say this quickly, I think Indonesia's commitment to  combating people smuggling is showed by the disruption of 309 ventures that  involved 8800 potential irregular migrants, and there are a 184 arrests that flowed  from that. These are figures that apply since September 2008 and given the  challenges of managing these sorts of policing activities across an archipelago, I  think that the Indonesian contribution to disrupting people smuggling deserves credit. 

 Journalist: [Speaking Indonesian] 

 Marty Natalegawa: [Speaking Indonesian] 

 Question: I would like to ask to Mr Marty and Mr Bob Carr, what is the cooperation  with the country of origin for asylum seekers or illegal immigrants that was discussed  during the meeting? And how Australia and Indonesia could work with the original  countries who has asylum seekers and whether it was also discussed, a centre for  the those who arrived to a destination like a few years ago Australia raised the issue  of about East Timor or Malaysia. 

 Bob Carr: Sorry I missed the first part of your question. 

 Question: The first part was how Australia and Indonesia could work with original  countries for asylum seekers. 

 Bob Carr: I am not the Australian minister with responsibility for this; I do know that  my colleague the Minister for Immigration Chris Bowen would have a lot to say about  working with countries of origin. 

 We have got a whole network of approaches and understandings with the countries  that are the origin of irregular maritime arrivals in Australian waters and will continue  to press strongly, that is the most secure solution to the problem that Indonesia as a  transit country and Australia as a destination country have to grapple with, given the  displacement of peoples. But a solution is very difficult to come by, if you think of the  trauma of Sri Lanka recovering from decades of civil war if you think of the  challenges Afghanistan faces in rebuilding, achieving national sovereignty, then the  pressures are going to be there, we would like to see them minimized. 

 Question: The opposition in Australia Tony Abbot wants to be Prime Minister and  with the current policy changes, at the next election he could be. He wants to  Indonesia to take more responsibility and stop boats leaving and wants to turn them  back. What is your response to that policy that could become Australian policy? 

 Marty Natalegawa: As I said before, you know these national, bilateral, regional,  global efforts are meant to be complimentary, with myself emphasising that there is  room for Indonesia to do more, for us to effort…room for us disrupt the people  smuggling network. 

 I am only saying things which are within our control. No doubt the other governments  in the region and beyond have their own homework that they can be working on to  ensure that they do their bit to address this problem. 

 What needs to be emphasised is that this national efforts are meant to be  complementary in addition to and in synergy, they are not substitute for. So if I was  to emphasise Indonesia's own role, that we can still grow further and enhance, it's  not by way of saying we are the only one that can be doing these things. I am just 

 saying things that, I…we could be doing I am sure the Australian Government has its  own efforts as well. But they must be seen as being mutual reinforcing and mutually  compatible. 

 Thank you.
