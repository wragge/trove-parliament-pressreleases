 A statement on asylum seeker cruelty 

 

 

 

 I’m satisfied the Labor Party have finally buckled to public pressure and announced that they  will oppose the Government’s cruel and inhumane laws to ban asylum seekers who arrive by  boat from ever entering Australia.    

 This is a victory for everyone in the community who stood up and made their voices heard.  It’s a victory for everyone who have said loud and clear that they won’t tolerate the Labor  and Liberal parties’ race to the bottom about who can treat asylum seekers the worst.    

 The pressure is now back on the Government to listen to the community as well and to scrap  their abhorrent policies of offshore processing, mandatory detention and towbacks.    

 To that end I have written again to the International Criminal Court as part of my ongoing  request that they open an investigation into the Australian Government for crimes against  humanity under Article 15 of the Rome Statute. A copy of my most recent correspondence  with the ICC is attached.
