 300th Boat Arrival Under Labor - Yet Another Milestone of Failure on Our  Borders 

 28/04/12  

 Labor has wracked up another milestone of failure on our borders, with the arrival of  the 300th illegal boat on their watch, Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border  Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 “The latest illegal boat arrival, with 60 people on board, is the 300th boat and the  300th border protection policy failure under Labor,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “As Labor continues to be weighed down by stench and scandal, 300 boats confirm  that border protection is Julia Gillard’s worst policy failure. This Prime Minister has  presided over the complete dismantling of Australia’s once strong border protection  system with people smugglers the only winners,” he said. 

 “Labor’s 300 boats have resulted in $3.9 billion in budget blow outs and counting,  chaos, rioting and the collapse of our detention network, the Oceanic Viking debacle,  East Timor farce, the Malaysia five for one people swap failure and $160 million  dollars in profits for people smugglers. 

 “Over half of Labor’s 300 boat arrivals have come on Julia Gillard’s watch. This is the  Prime Minister who promised to smash the people smugglers’ business model but  has become the people smugglers’ stimulus model with her continued failures on our  borders. 

 “Almost 17,000 people have now arrived under Labor’s failed policies and people  smugglers have ramped up their efforts since Labor announced their Greens policy  of let them in, let them out for boat arrivals in November last year. 

 “As the milestones of failure mount, the government’s only policy is to blame the  Coalition. This is not a real policy but a pathetic attempt to deflect attention from their  failures and hide from accountability. 

 “Only the Coalition is serious about border protection and will implement proven  policies that will stop the boats,” Mr Morrison said. 

 Mr Keenan said: “The 300th illegal boat arrival since Labor unravelled the Coalition’s  strong border protection policies is a harsh reality check.  

 “There are no signs of this constant stream of boat arrivals relenting whilst the Gillard  Government remain in power.  

 “With no semblance of a border protection policy, Labor seems content to simply sit  back and watch the people smugglers make their fortune at the expense of  endangering thousands of lives.  

 “It has been made crystal clear by the Gillard Government that they are only  interested in blaming others for their own incompetence rather than acting in the  national interest and the Australian people won’t be offered any viable solutions by  the Labor Party to this border protection crisis,” Mr Keenan said.
