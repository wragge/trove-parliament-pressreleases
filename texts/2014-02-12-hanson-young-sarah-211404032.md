 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 12 February 2014   

 Labor and Liberal agree on indefinite detention  of children with ASIO bill   

 A bill legislating indefinite detention for at least 50 refugees with adverse ASIO assessments,  including five children, has passed the House of Representative today with Labor and Liberal  support, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “The Labor and Liberal Parties are in lock-step with one another when it comes to imprisoning  refugees, including children, indefinitely,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young said.   

 “This Bill will see dozens of refugees who have received secretive adverse ASIO assessments  locked up on Australian soil without charge and with no chance of release.   

 “Refugees receive adverse ASIO assessments for a range of reasons and there is no justification  for a ‘one-size-fits-all’ response, especially when it is this extreme.   

 “With Labor’s support this cruel and unnecessary Bill will sail through the Senate and become  harsh, oppressive law.   

 “Ranjini, a young mother from Sri Lanka, and her children have spent years in the Villawood  Detention Centre because of an adverse ASIO assessment. She doesn’t know why she is facing  indefinite detention but she does know that her children, some of whom were born in  detention, are suffering.   

 “Australia has been condemned by the UN for its indefinite detention of these refugees. We  were told to improve our process for dealing with these cases, but this bill does the exact  opposite.”
