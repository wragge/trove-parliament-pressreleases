 PRESS RELEASE THE HON. LES JOHNSON MHR FOR HUGHES Â® OPPOSITION WHIP November 12, 1982 314/82

 WHEN IS AN INCREASE NOT AN INCREASE

 The answer is when you are a migrant or refugee living in a 

 Commonwealth Hostel,  said Les Johnson MHR for Hughes.

 "Whilst most Social Security pension and benefit rates were 

 increased this month,  single migrants and refugees will be 

 $4.10 worse off and married couples $7.55 worse off.

 "This is because instructions issued to the Department of 

 Social Security will allow the government run hostels to take 

 back a bigger slice of their social security cheques,  leaving 

 migrants with less than they had before the November increase".

 Mr Johnson said the treatment of refugees and migrants .

 living in Commonwealth hostels is a prophetic indication of 

 what this Federal Government will stoop to if it thinks it 

 can get away with itI

 These people are being fleeced Mr Johnson said,  what the 

 government is giving with one hand it is taking back with the 

 other. .  .  .
