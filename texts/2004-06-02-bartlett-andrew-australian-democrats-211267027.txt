 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/443 WEDNESDAY 2 JUNE 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS  Refugee's cat ok but what about the children? There has been greater media and public interest in reuniting a refugee and his cat presently on Manus Island, than there has been in the dozens of children and mothers in Indonesia that are separated from their fathers in Australia on temporary protection visas, Democrats' leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett said today. It looks like enough public pressure has been applied, and enough money has been raised by concerned citizens to bring the cat through the quarantine process. Refugee advocate group, A Just Australia, has today released a DVD of interviews with mothers and children stuck in Indonesia while their husbands and fathers have been recognised as refugees but are on temporary protection visas. "The families are separated cruelly and needlessly," Senator Bartlett said. "The Democrats, urge the Government to show some compassion and reunite these families. "The only thing standing between the cat and his owner is quarantine law. The only thing standing between refugee children in Indonesia and their fathers in Australia is the bloody mindedness of the Government," concluded Senator Andrew Bartlett.
