 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 K133: Rudd hits new low with four  boats in 48 hours   05/06/10  

 Four boats carrying 180 people in just 48 hours has set a new low for the Rudd  Government, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and  Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said  today. 

 “Boats are arriving at will. This is second time four boats have turned up in such  quick succession, the last time being immediately after the introduction of Labor's  failed and discriminatory asylum freeze,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “On this latest occasion more people were on board and two of the four vessels were  in distress. This is another clear demonstration of the inherent dangers of illegal boat  arrivals both for passengers and our navy and border protection personnel,” he said. 

 “Kevin Rudd has put up the white flag on illegal boat arrivals. 

 “Only the Coalition will act, Kevin Rudd only has spin and excuses, this is no match  for people smugglers who clearly have his measure,” he said. 

 Mr Keenan said: “The people smugglers are laughing at this Prime Minister and his  weak attempts to try and restore any kind of order to Australia's borders. 

 “In just two days we have seen four boats arrive in defiance of this government, and  deliver almost 200 unauthorized arrivals to Australia. 

 “Just as Australians finally adjusted to a rate of a boat a day, they now have to face a  reality where two boats in one day is becoming the norm. 

 “This Government has lost all control of our borders and their right to be charged with  the responsibility of protecting them. 

 “Two boats in one day may be the new rate now, but unless this Government takes  action, the rate will only continue to rise,” he said.
