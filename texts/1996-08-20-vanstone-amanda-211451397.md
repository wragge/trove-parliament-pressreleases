  CHANGES TO STUDENT ASSISTANCE BASED ON 

  GENUINE NEED 

  V67/96 20 August 1996 

  Changes to the Federal Government's student assistance schemes announced in the 1996 Budget will  make them fairer and provide a more efficient use of taxpayers' money, the Minister for Employment,  Education and Training, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today. 

  Senator Vanstone said the changes will go further to ensure that students and families who have a  genuine need for financial assistance are the beneficiaries of AUSTUDY, ABSTUDY and the  Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme. 

  "The Coalition Government is firmly committed to maintaining the level of benefits to eligible families  which AUSTUDY provides," she said. 

  "At the same time, we want to send a strong message to the whole Australian community that well-off  families with extensive assets or high incomes will not be eligible to receive financial assistance via  AUSTUDY ." 

  Senator Vanstone announced four key reforms to student assistance schemes. 

  AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY age of independence raised to 25 years 

  Senator Vanstone said the age at which AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY students are considered independent  of their parents, and so not subject to the parental means test, would be raised from 22 to 25 years  from 1 January 1997. 

  Students who are being paid the independent rate in 1996 and who, but for the new measure would  subsequently be. paid that rate, will continue to be assessed as independent. 

  "This move addresses the community concern that treating students as independent from their 22nd  birthday does not properly reflect the obligation of families to contribute to the education of their  children," she said. 

  "In particular, students from more affiuent backgrounds who are undertaking lengthy periods of study  currently bypass parental means testing at age 22 and receive AUSTUDYI ABSTUDY assistance to  the end of their courses. 

  "This is not an equitable situation, nor is it making proper use of the taxpayer dollar ." 

  This Budget change means that students who tum 25 while undertaking an AUSTUDY or  ABSTUDY-approved course will continue to be subject to the parental means test to the end of that  course unless they qualify for the independent rate on a prescribed ground other than age (for  example, time in the workforce). 

  Senator Vanstone said this change would save $28 million in 1996-97 and $61 million in 1997-98.

  A two-year waiting period for AUSTUDY for migrants who arrive in Australia from 1 January  1997 

  Senator Vanstone said migrants arriving in Australia as pennanent residents on or after 1 January  1997 will need to wait two years before they may be eligible to receive AUSTUDY. 

  "The new measure is in line with the two-year waiting period for most social security benefits  introduced for migrants arriving in Australia on or after 1 April 1996," she said. 

  The waiting period will apply to New Zealand citizens . 

  Senator Vanstone stressed that the two year waiting period would not apply to migrants who arrived  in Australia before 1 January 1997. In addition, a safety net exemption from the waiting period will be  available to: 

  o Refugee and humanitarian migrants and their immediate family members.  o Fonner holders of visa subclass 820 (temporary visas issued to the spouses or fiances of  Australian citizens) .  o Migrants under the age of 22 whose circumstances have changed after arrival so that they no 

  longer have access to a parental home and financial support. 

  This initiative will not change the current requirement that applicants be Australian or New Zealand  citizens, or hold Australian pennanent resident status . (New Zealand citizens arriving in Australia  before 1 January 1997 will need to fulfil the current requirements of having at least six months  residency and are being pennanently settled in Australia .) 

  These changes will save $6 million in 1996-97 and $12 million in 1997-98. 

  AUSTUDY Actual Means Test 

  Senator Vanstone said tonight's Budget measures reaffinned the Government's strong support for the  Actual Means Test, which was introduced in 1996 to complement the existing AUSTUDY Income  and Asset Tests. 

  "The changes announced tonight to the AUSTUDY Actual Means Test for 1997 are the result ofa  review conducted of the test, in keeping with our election policy commitments," she said. 

  "The original Actual Means Test aimed to address community concerns that many comparatively  well-off families were able to receive AUSTUDY because oflowered taxable incomes through tax  minimisation . 

  "The changes announced tonight will make the test fairer and also address concerns that the Actual  Means Test applied in 1996 did not take sufficient account of individual family circumstances." 

  The target groups for the test will be expanded to close loopholes identified in 1996. 

  o Families in hardship in drought-affected areas will be protected by an exemption from the test  for those in receipt of Drought Relief Payment or Farm Household Support.  o Isolated families will be granted a concession for the costs they unavoidably incur in sending  their primary and secondary school children away from home to access education.  o Income earned by students from bona fide employment outside a family business will be 

  deducted from Actual Means.

  The changes will also ensure that families with access to similar financial means receive the same level  of assistance, irrespective of whether they are P AYE taxpayers or derive their income from more  complex financial arrangements. 

  Tightening of the Actual Means Test will save an additional $30 million in 1996-97 and $62 million in  1997-98. 

  Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme -non-means-tested Basic Boarding Allowance  raised to 55 per cent of average boarding fees 

  From 1 January 1997, the amount of the non-income-tested Basic Boarding Allowance will increase  from $2500 to $2900. 

  Senator Vanstone said this increase would restore the amount of the Basic Boarding Allowance to 55  per cent of the average level of boarding fees paid for boarding students receiving AlC benefits. 

  Low income families may also qualify for Additional Boarding Allowance paid on top of the Basic  Boarding Allowance. 

  This increase will cost $9.4 million over the next three years. 

  Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme -rate increase for the non-means-tested  Correspondence Allowance 

  Senator Vanstone said the Government had committed an extra $4 million over three years for rate  increases for the non-means-tested Correspondence Allowance in the Assistance for Isolated Children  (AlC) Scheme. 

  "From 1 January 1997, the amount of the non-income tested Correspondence Allowance will increase  to $1000 a year for primary students and to $1500 a year for secondary students," she said. 

  "This change will help families meet costs incurred by children studying by distance education  methods."
