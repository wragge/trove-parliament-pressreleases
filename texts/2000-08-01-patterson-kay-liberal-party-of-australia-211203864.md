 Senator Kay Patterson Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

 Media Release

 1 August 2000

 Launch of Tasmanian Plan to Assist New Settlers Permanent humanitarian entrants from culturally diverse backgrounds will benefit under a plan launched today by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Kay Patterson.

 "The new Tasmanian Settlement Plan will give strategic focus to coordinating community and government agencies' service delivery," Senator Patterson said.

 "The plan was developed over the past six months by the Tasmanian Immigration and Settlement Committee, a standing forum for community and government sectors to coordinate efforts assisting new migrants and refugee arrivals in the State.

 "Although the plan is a working guide to effectively settle new arrivals it also addresses some special needs of established migrant communities with ageing members."

 Senator Patterson said the plan drew together government and community agency efforts to further improve service delivery for overseas-born Tasmanians, and particularly services for more recent arrivals.

 "Implementing new and enhanced services should significantly improve the initial settlement experience for new arrivals and improve settlement outcomes for overseas-born Tasmanians," the Senator said.

 Copies of the plan can be obtained by contacting the Community Liaison Officer at the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, telephone (03) 6220 4010.
