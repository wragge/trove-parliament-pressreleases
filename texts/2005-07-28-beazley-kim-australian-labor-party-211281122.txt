 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON KIM C BEAZLEY MP   

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, BAXTER HEALTHCARE COMPANY,  PARRAMATTA, NSW   

 28 JULY 2005   

 E & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects: Industrial relations; Political advertising; Temporary  protection visas; Sale of Telstra; Climate control    

 BEAZLEY: All John Howard’s political spin is not going to fix the nation’s  needs in our industries.  He can get out there and politically spin all he likes.  What he can’t do is demonstrate that what he proposes to do is not against the  national interest and against the interests of ordinary Australian workers.  Peter  Costello said yesterday that from awards, lunch breaks, morning tea breaks,  comfort breaks should be eliminated - no rights should exist for the workforce in  these areas.     

 It is hypocritical, to say the least, given his expressed devotion to the long lunch  and to the happy lunch.  It’s okay for Peter Costello to take a lunch break - it’s  just not good enough for ordinary Australians to take a lunch break.  Now, the  fact of the matter is we have the hardest working workforce in the industrialised  world, certainly in terms of hours worked - 1,850 hours a year the average  Australian fulltime worker.  That compares with an American on 1,830; Japanese  on 1,740 and somebody from the Netherlands at 1,350.  We have the hardest  working workers in terms of hours worked.  And Peter Costello wants to work  them even harder but with no additional reward.  And John Howard joins him in 

 that ambition.  Now, we say back off.  We say back off.     

 We, and the ACTU, have a court case pending today as well in the High Court  because we cannot discern in the Budget that the Government bought down, any  line item related to advertising for their campaign using taxpayers’ dollars to  support their political spin on their changes in industrial relations.  And we want  to save the taxpayers some money.     

 Needless to say the ACTU and the Labor Party are paying for this, whereas the  Australian public is paying for John Howard to pick their pockets when it comes  to industrial relations.  What we say to John Howard about this and about this  court case is this: as far as we’re concerned no amount of political spin funded by  the taxpayer, at the taxpayer’s expense, is going to fix the fact that John 

 Howard’s legislation is unfair to Australian workers and takes away  fundamentally longstanding rights.  Over to you.   

 JOURNALIST: Will the workers for instance in this place today will be affected  by the IR changes?   

 BEAZLEY: The workers behind me you can see are having, in some  cases, breakfast, in other cases morning tea and if you came in a couple of hours  time you’d see some of them having lunch.  Now, the simple fact of the matter is  that they are entitled to that by either their collective agreements or their awards.   And if you eliminate from awards the capacity to sustain those things in the  workplace which mean that life is liveable and that you can anticipate a decent  life time in the workforce, you eliminate that from awards you considerably  reduce the rights of ordinary Australians to a decent, comfortable and productive  workplace.     

 So, what you see behind us, the canteen, the rights that workers have to a small  amount of recreation during the day and of course, to fuel up their bodies to keep  them going - go - that goes.  Any right to it goes.  That is one example of how  unfair and how against the national interest, against the productivity of the  Australian workforce, these extremist Bills are going to take us.   

 JOURNALIST: What’s the next step if you’re unsuccessful in the High Court?   

 BEAZLEY: We can see no line item there.  Therefore we think it’s our  duty to try to get - having tried to get the Government to explain what it’s doing  and where it has the authority to run the campaign and not had a reply from them  - we’ve done the next logical thing, we’ve taken the matter to court.  It is just one  small step in what is a broadly-based campaign.     

 But we think it’s utterly illegitimate for the Government to use tax payers’ dollars  the way they do.  If they want to campaign on this, the Liberal Party they should  do what the ACTU are doing - use their own money.   

 JOURNALIST:  (inaudible)    

 BEAZLEY: The ACTU is spending their own money.  The Government  sees that the ACTU campaign has exposed them for the extremists that they are  on this industrial legislation.  And what they want to do is get out a political spin  at taxpayers’ expense.  But as I said before, all John Howard’s political spin is  not going to overcome the problem.  No matter how much of the taxpayers’  dollars he spends on it, he’s not going to overcome the problem that the  Australian population has worked out the extremist intent of his legislation.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, what do you make of the Federal Court’s ruling  that refugees whose Temporary Protection Visas have expired cannot be  deported.   

 BEAZLEY: The Government has made a complete mess of immigration  law.  Everything in it is a mess - the way they handle Temporary Protection  Visas; the way they handle the investigation of people who come into this  country; they don’t know whether they’ve got Australians on their hands or non-Australians, the whole thing is a mess.  And all I’d say about it is it’s just one  more revelation about a fact there was a statement we made which we hold to be  true.  You can’t protect your borders in this country with a mess.   

 JOURNALIST: If I could just ask on the IR changes, Mr Beazley, to what  extent do you think the Government’s campaign on the changes, in other words  obviously promoting them, has worked in swinging the public mood, has it at all? 

 

 BEAZLEY: I don’t believe so because I think the public is awake to this  Government’s extremism.  And I think the public resents the Government  spending the amount of money they do.  Do you know, since this Government  has been elected it has spent $900 million of the taxpayers’ funds advertising its  political interests.  The unchained ads for the GST.  The $61 million worth of ads  on Medicare.  And now we’re going to see more than $20 million spent on the IR  campaign. This isn’t public information.  It’s Liberal Party propaganda.  $900  million worth of it about to be added to.  Well, we’re going to do what we can at  our expense and at the ACTU’s expense to stop it.  I don’t know if we’ll succeed.   We seemed to have seen an opportunity there to save the taxpayers a bit of  money and I hope we succeed.   

 JOURNALIST: Who would you like to see as Bob Carr’s successor?   

 BEAZLEY: It’s a matter for the New South Wales Party of course.  I  enjoyed an opportunity to talk to Bob Carr yesterday, at a function last night and  of course during the course of the day.  I am in the process of political grieving at  this moment and all I can think about is Bob and Helena.  And I’m very happy to  leave the selection of his successor to my State colleagues.   

 JOURNALIST: On that issue, Mr Carr has made it very plain the he doesn’t  want to run for federal Parliament but would you welcome him in a behind the  doors role? 

 

 BEAZLEY: I’d welcome him in any role.  And he’s already offered to me to  - he said don’t you dare lose touch and don’t stop the communication.  I’ve been  a friend of Bob’s since the 1970’s and it’s a sad moment for me to see him going.   I’ve tried hard over the years to get Bob Carr into federal politics and he has  spurned all of those initiatives.  I think Bob has had enough, frankly.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, on the sale of Telstra.  Telstra said yesterday that  it didn’t think the universal service obligation was tenable in the future, what  implications for users in the bush and for the Government’s plan to sell off the  rest of Telstra?   

 BEAZLEY: There is no way you can sell Telstra and provide anything  remotely approaching the quality of service for people who live in the bush or live  in the outer metropolitan areas.  You can’t do it.   And in 10 years time we don’t  know the technologies that will be needed to ensure that the bush has equality of  services with the city.  There’s only one way to future-proof Telstra - keep it in  government hands - it’s the only way. That’s our position and we will be pursuing  that in Parliament when the Parliament meets on this.  The public of this country  do not want John Howard to sell Telstra and he shouldn’t do it.   

 JOURNALIST: I understand the Government is to announce this afternoon a  new group on climate control including the US, China, India, is it a cop out or is it  a way forward?   

 BEAZLEY: Spin, this Government is magnificent in spin.  What the  Government has is a big problem on it hands and it’s this: it has a report on its  table which says the Australia we know and love in 30 years time is dead.  Even  if nothing else happens - there’s no increase in greenhouse gas, none, which of  course there will be, but even if nothing happens in 30 years time - no Barrier 

 Reef; no Kakadu; all our beautiful suburbs on the waterfront - under threat; 25  per cent down in rainfall in our agricultural areas.  That means the Australia we  love and know is dead.  Now, John Howard has refused to sign Kyoto and he is  wrong.  He is working against the Australian national interest.  And he is trying to 

 spin out something to cover him.    

 Well I can tell him this: the Chinese may be talking to him in secret but what  they’re doing practically is sitting down with the Europeans so they can negotiate  with the Europeans involvement in the European emission control trade to get a  market-based solution to our environmental problems.  That’s what the Chinese  are doing.  They might chat to us but they’re getting down to tors seriously with  the Europeans because they see here a massive market opportunity.  And we’re  missing out on it because John Howard is stubborn, is opposed to the national  interest - he won’t sign the Kyoto Protocols.  This is all part of trying to cover  what is a serious problem emerging for this nation and this Government.
