 Minister Asks Ballina About Managing Migration

 MPS 171/2001

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, will visit Ballina to ask residents for the first time their views on the size and composition of the 2002-2003 Australian migration and humanitarian programs tomorrow.

 "The consultations will give residents of Ballina the opportunity to have their say on Australia's migrant intake for the coming financial year," Mr Ruddock said.

 "I look forward to meeting with people to hear their views. I particularly look forward to discussing how more skilled migrants can be attracted to Ballina and the other regional areas of New South Wales," he said.

 "In 2000-01, 65 percent of visas granted in NSW under regional migration initiatives relied on a sponsorship from a relative."

 "The Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme (RSMS) also has an important role for regional NSW. Under RSMS a regional employer who cannot fill a position from the local labour market can sponsor a skilled migrant," he said.

 Ballina, and other regional areas in NSW, attract a significant number of skilled migrants under the State/Territory specific and regional migration initiatives.

 "In 2000-01, there were 271 visas granted to migrants coming to NSW under these initiatives, almost double the numbers in previous years," he said.

 The Minister launched his annual consultations in Sydney early this month and will hold meetings with State, Territory and local governments, business and industry groups, unions, environmental bodies, welfare organisations, refugee agencies, and representatives of Australia's migrant communities.

 The consultation process includes:

 a discussion paper raising issues on the size and composition of Australia's Migration and Humanitarian Programs; â ï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 a range of public meetings in capital cities and regional centres including Ballina, Kalgoorlie, Townsville, Launceston and Mt Gambier; â ï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 written submissions from the Australian community; and â ï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 discussion on migration issues on an on-line discussion forum. â ï¿»ï¿»ï¿»

 "The meetings provide an ideal forum for all Australians to contribute their ideas and provides the Government with community views on issues regarding refugee resettlement and other humanitarian and general migration issues," Mr Ruddock said.

 Note: The Discussion Paper on the 2002-2003 Migration and Humanitarian Programs, along with other information on the consultations, is available on the Minister's website at www.minister.immi.gov.au/consultations.
