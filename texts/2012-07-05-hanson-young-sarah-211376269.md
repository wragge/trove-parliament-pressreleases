 MEDIA ALERT  

 

 Thursday 5 July 2012 

 

 Refugee families plead for safer pathways 

 

 Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, Australian Greens spokesperson for Immigration and Citizenship, is  currently visiting Indonesia and available for interview and comment. She is there to investigate the  factors holding up refugee assessment and causing people to take dangerous boat journeys.  

 

 Yesterday Senator Hanson-Young met with asylum seekers and refugees in Jakarta and Cisarua, and  visited immigration detention centres and prisons. She heard first-hand from families who said they  would resort to boarding a boat to Australia because they do not have any other choice. Senator  Hanson-Young listened to parents, including single mothers, who do not feel safe where they are  and want to continue to Australia to find protection, education and a life free from persecution. 

 

 Over the next two days Senator Hanson-Young will be meeting with peak bodies such as the UNHCR  and IOM and furthering her engagement with NGOs in the refugee services sector, legal advocates  and human rights groups. 

 

 

 Please contact Kelly Farrow on 0427 604 760 to arrange an interview.
