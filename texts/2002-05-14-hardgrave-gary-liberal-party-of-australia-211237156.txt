 Gary Hardgrave MP   Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs 

   Media Release H45/2002 - 14 May 2002

  

 Government Committed to Community Harmony

 The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, today announced the provision of $3.5 million a year from 2002-03 for the Living in Harmony initiative in the 2002 Budget.

 “The Living in Harmony initiative is a key element of the Government’s implementation of A New Agenda for Multicultural Australia ,” Mr Hardgrave said.

 “By promoting community harmony, the initiative contributes to Australia’s nation-building,” he said.

 “The provision of $3.5 million a year, including an annual community grants round of $1.5 million, demonstrates the Government’s serious commitment to promoting good community relationships.

 “Living in Harmony has a balanced approach of encouraging communities to develop local solutions to local issues of racism and intolerance, while also developing projects with strategic national importance.

 “A remarkable feature of the initiative is that so many “mainstream” organisations are displaying an interest in working with ethnic and Indigenous communities to address racism and to promote harmony.

 “The initiative focuses on issues important to communities across Australia, such as youth, Indigenous, refugee and rural/remote issues.

 “Local solutions are being developed in communities around Australia.

 “In a relatively short period of time, the Living in Harmony initiative has made real progress in addressing issues of racism in Australia,” Mr Hardgrave said.
