 FaCS Wins Tender To Set Up Welfare Strategies In Bosnia And Herzegovina 

 

 11 February 2003 

 Australia's internationally recognised expertise in social policy has helped us win a  World Bank tender to assist Bosnia and Herzegovina in setting up a social welfare  strategy.   

 The Commonwealth Department of Family and Community Services (FaCS), in co-operation with US based international consultancy firm IOS Partners Inc, won the  tender over a number of other proposals.   

 In financial terms, this project is Australia's largest export to Bosnia and Herzegovina  with our services bringing over AUD$500 000 back into this country.   

 Since the wars of the 1990s, the social welfare system in Bosnia and Herzegovina has  been in a state of crisis. They are now seeking to make the transition from  humanitarian relief to a more consistent and sustainable system.    

 The armed conflict has also meant that the proportion of persons with disabilities is  much higher in Bosnia and Herzegovina than other European countries. Therefore, a  significant part of the project will focus on dealing with disabilities policy and  program development.    

 Over an eight-month period, the project will help the government of Bosnia and  Herzegovina, as well as provincial and local governments, to plan and implement a  social welfare strategy. At the national level, seven FaCS consultants will work with  the Ministry of Social Affairs, Displaced Persons and Refugees, and the Ministry of  Labor and Veterans' Affairs.    

 My department won this internationally competitive bid to provide technical  assistance to the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the strength of our past  successes with social welfare reform projects. Another example is the recently  completed World Bank funded Enterprise Housing and Social Security Reform  project in China.    

 It is fantastic to see our expertise and experience in social policy development being  recognised and that we can use it to help other countries build, reform and enhance  their own social security systems.
