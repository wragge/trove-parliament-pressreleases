 MEDIA COMMENT  17 January 2014   

 $95 million aid cut to the International Development Association   

 Greens overseas aid and development spokesperson Senator Lee Rhiannon said:   

 "The $95 million International Development Association funding should have been redirected to poverty  alleviation not chopped out of the already squeezed aid budget.   

 "The Greens have always been critical of the IDA because it is a debt creating mechanism for poor  countries, but this aid budget slash is once again at the expense of people who are in desperate need of  our assistance.   

 "It is shameful that our aid budget will be 0.3 per cent of GNI - billions of dollars short of the 2000 UN  Millennium Development Goal target of 0.7 per cent by 2015 that the Howard Government endorsed.   

 "The Abbott government's cruelty towards those less fortunate than us has no ends, whether it be  asylum seekers or people living in poverty overseas.
