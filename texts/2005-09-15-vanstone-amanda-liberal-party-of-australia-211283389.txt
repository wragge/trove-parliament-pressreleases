  New migration laws - clearer guidelines 

  The Government will introduce new measures to the Migration Act, putting in place time  limits for ministerial decision on protection visas, Minister for Immigration, Amanda  Vanstone, said today. 

  Under the changes, the Minister will have 90 days to decide applications for protection  visas. These time limits will also apply to any reviews on those decisions by the Refugee  Review Tribunal. 

  “The changes promote greater transparency in the handling of immigration matters,  particularly for Protection Visa applicants,” Senator Vanstone said. 

  “The time limit on the Protection Visa process reflects the Government’s policy that  applications shcu!d be cmsidered h a timely and efficient way. 

  “Currently about 80 percent of protection visa applications are completed within 90 days.  For those in detention more than 80 percent of cases are resolved within six weeks. There  are currently no protection visa applicants in detention whose application has gone beyond  90 days. 

  “But we can do better. The new laws require that the Secretary of DlMlA and the Principal  Member of the Refugee Review iribunai repori aii appiications that are not decided within  90 days to me. 

  “In addition, new measures to strengthen the role of the Commonwealth Ombudsman as  Immigration Ombudsman, which I announced when releasing the Palmer Report in July,  will assist in completing the investigations into 200 detention cases initially referred to Mr  Palmer and Mr Comrie. 

  “Under the new legislation, immigration staff will be able to disclose information about a  person to the public to help establish their identity or location. 

  “Together, these changes will enable my department and agencies to effectively carry-out  their obligations under the Migration Act, particularly where we are dealing with matters  involving people in detention,” Senator Vanstone said.
