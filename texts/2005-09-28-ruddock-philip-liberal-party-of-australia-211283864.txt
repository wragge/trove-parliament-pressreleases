 TRANSCRIPT   

 

 HOBART PRESS CONFERENCE 

 AT THE COMPUTER NETWORK VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT PROJECT  WEDNESDAY 28 SEPTEMBER 2005 

 

 Subject: Counter terrorism laws 

 

 QUESTION:  [Inaudible]?  

 ATTORNEY-GENERAL PHILIP RUDDOCK:  Well I don’t want to give people advice, but what we know is that  increasingly young people who are highly computer literate and  they try to find linkages with the broader systems in which they  can get into other computer systems and use - sometimes it might  be purely accidental but at other times it could be quite deliberate  to close down systems, to jeopardise them, damage them by just  simply changing the operational considerations, I mean that’s how  I would see it.  And we don’t want to see that happen.  And, as I say, we don’t believe in this system here - which is  highly professionally run - that there are any vulnerabilities.  This  is about reassurance, it’s to ensure that by allowing somebody to  challenge your orthodoxy you have tested against any possible  contingency that might not have been fully thought of.  It’s almost like a game with the experts.  In this case I think you  will find that the steps that have been taken have been more than  adequate to protecting the infrastructure, but we want to be  reassured of that. 

 QUESTION:  That vulnerability hasn’t been exposed in the past?  RUDDOCK:   These sorts of programs which have been using other essential  supplies - water, and I [indistinct] announcements up in Brisbane  in relation to the services there not so long ago; and we’re doing it 

 in the health area; there are a number of areas in which we’re  doing it - have not yet exposed vulnerabilities.  But it is more  abundant caution that prompts you to go through this program  and to keep people alert to the potential.  I mean if you look today at the way the Internet is being used - 

 Parliament House, Canberra  ACT  2600 â¢ Telephone (02) 6277 7300 â¢ Fax (02) 6273 4102  www.law.gov.au/ag 

 and it is being used extensively - by people who have a clear  intention of occasioning harm, it is not beyond the possibilities  that they could use that system and their knowledge to reap quite  considerable havoc if we don’t prepare and test ourselves against  all those vulnerabilities.  QUESTION:  [Inaudible]?  

 RUDDOCK: Well, I mean, it is fair to say that if you look at what has been said  and claimed, that Australians clearly in the minds of people who  want to harm us.  Osama bin Laden has included us, and his al  Qaeda colleagues have mentioned us.  As you know - we think it  was largely rhetoric - but there was a tape acquired in Pakistan  fairly recently in which there was an American who was linked to  the al Qaeda organisation, it is said, who named Melbourne and  Los Angeles as areas in which there might be targeting.  You can look at the level of profile that a community has and  assume that the higher the profile the greater the risk, I mean it’s  not an unreasonable assumption.  In that sense Tasmania has a  very positive profile with its reliable food supply, its unique  climate, as a centre for tourism and even as a more viable location  in which, in your more mature years, to retire.  You know, I mean I read these matters, I guess other people do,  whether that means you’re vulnerable or not it’s a matter of  judgement.  But I have no specific information that suggests that  Tasmania faces a greater risk than any other part of Australia, but  obviously the profile is not as high as centres like Sydney and  Melbourne. 

 QUESTION: Why would you say that these new [indistinct] laws do not  amount to internment without charges [inaudible]?  RUDDOCK: Internment without charge?  QUESTION: [Inaudible] internment without charge?  RUDDOCK: Look, I think some people will use terminology that is designed to 

 try and deflect discussion from what are essentially reasonable  measures that contain a high level of protection, but measures that  are designed to protect the Australian community at a time when  we have never been more vulnerable.  And the reality is that  governments have a responsibility to do all in their power to be  able to protect people’s right to life, safety and their personal  security.  And we do it every day in relation to a number of  measures where we do restrict what are called personal liberties.    And I emphasise this one every day because it is so logical that  you accept it without questioning…  QUESTION: This is a political situation?  RUDDOCK: No, this is a … 

 Attorney-General Transcript  2 

 QUESTION: [Inaudible] riding down the street?  RUDDOCK: Yes it is a matter of governments have rules to restrict your  personal freedom to choose where you will go without  questioning - without questioning - in order to protect people’s 

 right to life, security and safety.    you cannot drive down the right hand side of the road in the face  of somebody else because you know that that will put people’s  lives at risk.  Now we’re dealing with…  QUESTION:  [Inaudible]?  

 RUDDOCK: No, you’d be charged with an offence and that offence restricts  your right to be able to behave in that way.  And I tell you, if you  did it deliberately and maliciously, the level of penalty would be  very, very significant.  But there is a willingness to observe those  rules and to accept the restrictions that are imposed.  Here we’re dealing with a range of issues, let me put it very  crudely:  there are some people who are saying government you  haven’t proved to us that we are a target, and you’ve got to do  that in order to justify what you’re about.  There are some things  that I can’t talk about, but there are some things which even you  know about, and about which I can talk, which make it very clear  that we’ve been targeted.  Five years ago in Singapore Australian interests were targeted  when people planned to blow up our mission, and they were part  of the JI operation - Jemaah Islamiah.  We had the bombing in Bali  where 82 Australians lost their lives, tragically; we’ve had the  Marriott Hotel bombing where again our interests were being  targeted.  Then we had the bombing of our embassy in Jakarta  where many other people died, mercifully not Australians but  people passing by and others who were going about their normal  daily activities.  Now you might say, well look, that’s not Australia it’s our  interests abroad, that it’s not going to happen here.  Well let me  just say we know from steps that numbers of people have taken  that they have had in mind occasioning such harm in Australia.   Jack Roche who surveilled the Jewish Embassy in Canberra - or  the Israeli Embassy in Canberra - and the Israeli Consulate in  Sydney for the purposes of carrying out a terrorist attack.  He  pleaded guilty to that offence and is now serving a term of  imprisonment in Western Australia.  We have two other people who have been committed to trial - and  that means there is a prima face case - committed to trial for  training with a terrorist organisation since 2002.  We have numbers of other people who have been named - oh, I’m 

 Attorney-General Transcript  3 

 sorry, who have been referred to not in absolute numbers but  have been referred to in the public report of ASIO, and more  comprehensive information is provided directly to governments  as part of the intelligence assessment, and accessible to the  Opposition.  So you do have objective data against which you can make an  assessment that there are people here who are intent on  occasioning harm if they can, and others who have trained in  order to be able to undertake such activity.  What you’re talking about are essentially a range of measures that  enable us to manage situations in which large numbers of people  are disposed, an opportunity in relation to people where there is  creditable intelligence information that they may have trained  with a terrorist organisation or may have intent to carry out a  terrorist act - and there has to be a reasonable suspicion that that  has occurred - and with my approval the police can go to a court  and get a control order.  And that control order would enable a  court to say there will be some restrictions upon your movement:  you may not be able to go beyond this suburb; you may not be  able to travel interstate; may restrict who you can meet with or  contact; may restrict your phone calls.  There are a range of issues  and those steps have to be shown to be reasonably likely to  contain a potential terrorist threat.  And people can go back to a court if they believe circumstances  have changed and they can review the basis on which the control  order was given.  Now I think that that is a perfectly reasonable way to go when  you know that the resources that are required to put people under  covert surveillance and the numbers of people that we’re  potentially having to look at that this gives you a better  opportunity of having a handle on what is occurring.  And you could make the same case in relation to the preventive  detention regime that we’ve asked the states to implement.  And if  you look at the United Kingdom the control orders and the  preventive detention arrangements were seen as crucial to being  able to manage both the investigation of the recent London  bombing and being able to contain other events about which we  don’t hear a great deal that might have been planned in the  United Kingdom and which they were able to avert.  QUESTION: Attorney-General, just on another issue, can I ask you about the 

 newspaper report today about the Bakhtiari family…  RUDDOCK: Can we finish the other issue first, I’ll come back to that but that’s  an incidental issue, I’d rather try and keep to the topic if we can. 

 Attorney-General Transcript  4 

 QUESTION: [inaudible] that the new laws actually be more to reduce the civil  liberties of Australians than prevent an attack like the London  bombing? 

 RUDDOCK: Look, we think the measures are proportionate, we think they  contain a high level of scrutiny not only by external agencies like  the ombudsman or the Inspector-General of Security and  Intelligence but also judicial oversight.  These are not measures  that are being implemented whereby police or politicians have  any capacity to be able to put restrictions on people or to restrict  people’s movements.  They’re measures that have been very  carefully thought through in terms of getting the balance right in  terms of protecting the right to safety; the right to life of the  Australian community; and impacting in really relatively small  measure on people’s freedom of movement, freedom of  association.    And these are matters which, if you look at them, are  proportionate, and where there is an opportunity for those who  believe there is reasonable evidence to put it before judicial  authorities and to have it judged independently.  And that’s the  way in which it’s been planned.  QUESTION: There is a chance that the [inaudible]?  RUDDOCK: Well I don’t think there is very much chance at all.  I mean what 

 you’re talking about is conspiracy between the police, the  attorney-general and judicial authorities in relation to the way in  which these matters are dealt with.  All I can say is it is highly  unlikely when you have very, very significant independent  oversight by independent agencies, as well as judicial oversight.  QUESTION: Mr Ruddock, there are reports today that ASIO is watching as 

 many as 800 people.  How real is the threat of a home-grown  terrorist attack here [inaudible]?  RUDDOCK: Well let me deal with two issues: first the suggestion that there are  numbers of people who are politically or otherwise motivated to 

 carry out terrorist attack numbering many hundreds.  Yesterday the Director-General of Security made it very clear that  he was not giving any numbers and that use of numbers is quite  unhelpful.  And so that is not information that was provided to  the premiers by the Director-General of ASIO, and is not  information that ASIO put in the public arena or would want in  the public arena.  Now I can’t confirm or deny particular numbers, and I don’t  intend to.  But I do say what I said to you before: it is public  knowledge that people have trained with terrorist organisations  and it is public knowledge that there are people who maybe 

 Attorney-General Transcript  5 

 motivated to carry out terrorist acts in Australia, we don’t deny  that.  That’s why these issues are serious.  By putting numbers on  it is not helpful, and it’s not always accurate because you don’t  know what the definitions are, you don’t know how people have  been categorised, you don’t know the way in which circumstances  might change which would lead to the numbers being different  today to what they were yesterday, and sometimes it’s not always  helpful to be able to tell others who may know how many people  have trained, that you either got it right or wrong [inaudible].  So, let me, let me just put to bed once and for all this, this idea that  there were, there were particular numbers.  But, you had a second question, and I’ve put it out of my mind.  QUESTION: Oh, just how real is that threat - a home-grown threat?  RUDDOCK: Home-grown threat - well, let me just, let me just say, it is realistic 

 to assume there is a threat.  I mean that’s what persuaded the  Premiers’.  There is a threat.  We know of some of those risks, but  do we know of it all?  The answer is, possibly not.    Are there people who may be under our radar?  I don’t know.  If I  did know, they wouldn’t be under our radar.  But can I say, it’s something that some people describe as  inevitable; won’t happen - no I can’t say a terrorist attack won’t  happen in Australia.  I can’t say that.  It’s quite possible.  But what I can add is that we have to take every step that we can  to ensure that it doesn’t happen, and that’s what these measures  are all about.  We’re finished on that.  One more question, yeah.  QUESTION:  [Inaudible]  Premiers’  summit [inaudible] there was a briefing.  

 This has been given to a large number of people from an  Opposition party’s view; sooner or later the information is going  to be distributed more widely.  What can you tell us about what  was said at that briefing?  RUDDOCK: Well, I mean I, I know what the Director General of ASIO said, 

 and I don’t intend to say anything of what, of what was his  presentation.  But what I can say is, there were no numbers attached to any  particular categories provided by him and he cautioned  specifically against information of that sort being provided by him  or his organisation, for the very factors that I’ve outlined.  And that’s all I intend to elaborate on in relation to that.  QUESTION: Just one more - when are you expecting the State Premiers to 

 [inaudible] of the law? 

 Attorney-General Transcript  6 

 RUDDOCK: Well, my view is that political leaders in Australia, regardless of  their party affiliations, really believe they have a, an overriding  responsibility to protect the safety and security of the Australian  people.  And they will act in the national interest, as you would  expect.  And there has been a high level of collaboration before, and it  would have been unreasonable to expect that that would not be  possible with proper explanation and consideration of these  issues.  So, my expectation was that we would see the outcome that we  did.  But why do I think that - it’s because I think on these issues, as  we’ve never seen so clearly before, these are not matters about  which there should be a political divide.  These are matters about  which people have to put aside indifferences and work  collectively in the national interest, and they do.  Now let me just deal with the Bakhtiari issue - it’s not my issue,  but the question generally in relation to asylum issues - which is  what you are examining - is, do people who are in Australia have  an entitlement to our protection; such that they should not be  returned - the word in the Refugee Convention is referred to a  situation where they will be persecuted.  Now, essentially, you not only have to look at the question as to  whether or not it is safe for a person to return to their country of  origin, you also have to look at whether or not they have any  other place in which they are entitled to live, where they would  have been safe.  And the issue in relation to this particular family is the same as it  is in relation to anybody else - it’s not a question of where you  were born; what other entitlements you may have where you  would be at risk, in other words, it’s not a question, and it never  was a question as to whether or not somebody may have come  from Afghanistan; been born in Afghanistan; I think my  recollection is that it was never questioned that Mrs Bakhtiari may  have, may have been Afghan.  The argument always was, and it was accepted by those who  made the decisions, that the family had a, an entitlement to reside  safely in Pakistan, and an entitlement to return to Pakistan.  And  they did.  So this question of whether or not they had an additional  entitlement to go back to Afghanistan, is a non-issue. 

 QUESTION:  [Inaudible] it wouldn’t have made a difference, is that what you’re  saying? 

 Attorney-General Transcript  7 

 RUDDOCK: Well, I’m saying it was never questioned as far as I recall, that Mrs  Bakhtiari may have been born in Afghanistan.  The issue, the issue  was, could the family, having been found not to be refugees, be  returned safely to Pakistan, and they were.  And, that was based upon something that, if I read the story  correctly, is still something that hasn’t been clarified.  Mr  Bakhtiari, it is not claimed, was Afghan.  And the view always  was that, that he was from Quetta, in Belochistan in Pakistan.  He  may have well married somebody who, who wasn’t Pakistani,  who was Afghan, may well have.  But in terms of where they could return safely, Pakistan was  always the option.  They returned to Pakistan, and now it’s said  they’re living in Afghanistan, and to all intents and purposes, they  went there voluntarily, and that would suggest to me they’d come  to a view that they could return there safely.  Alright?  QUESTION: Paul Boylan said this morning that the Bakhtiari family and 

 [inaudible] legislation, and both parties should be offered entry  back into Australia.  What do you say to that?  RUDDOCK: Well, I’d simply say you’re wrong.  And, I mean they’re not,  they’re not matters in which I would put together.  Mr Parkin 

 received an adverse security assessment, and that was based upon  ASIO’s responsibility to protect the Australian community from  politically motivated violence.  And I’ve dealt with that issue before, but I mean that was the  background to the decision.  The visa was cancelled and he had no  lawful entitlement to remain here, and he was removed.  The Bakhtiari’s did not receive an adverse security assessment.   They came without lawful authority - in other words without a  visa - and they were entitled to make a claim for protection, and  they did.   And those protection claims didn’t stand up to scrutiny.  They  were found not to be refugees.  They were [inaudible] removed  from Australia.  And, if you, if you are in Australia without a valid visa, then if we  can remove people safely, that will be the outcome, and it’s what  happened in both cases.  The decisions were lawful, and if people  want to challenge - in the Bakhtiari’s case I might say, they did,  they challenged the decisions over and over again, at very  considerable cost, to every court that they could get access to -  and without commenting on Mr Parkin’s matter, I understand he  may be seeking a review of some of those decisions, and he’s 

 Attorney-General Transcript  8 

 Attorney-General Transcript  9 

 entitled to test the lawfulness of the decisions taken.  Alright?  Thank you very much.  QUESTION: [Inaudible] Bali Nine?  [Inaudible] death penalty?  RUDDOCK: No, but look, the only point I’d make is that police work 

 collaboratively together; that when you’re at a point where  charges may be brought; charges which carry death penalties; the  agreement on mutual assistance in criminal matters, and there is a  formal agreement [inaudible] cannot be amended unless the  government that is seeking access to information, from us, agrees  that they will not seek a death penalty.  So,   QUESTION: [Inaudible] for the Australian Government to provide any 

 assistance to the [inaudible]? 

 RUDDOCK: No, the point, the point I’m making is, the agreements that we  have with other countries, particularly those who impose a death  penalty, is that we will not provide cooperation in relation to  criminal matters unless there is an assurance that the death  penalty will not be [inaudible].  So, if there was further information that had to be obtained  [inaudible] here, through the Australian Federal Police, we would  seek their assurance that Indonesia would not be wanting a death  penalty in each of those cases. 

 QUESTION:  [Inaudible].  

 RUDDOCK:  [Inaudible]  providing  [inaudible].   QUESTION:  [Inaudible].  

 RUDDOCK: Well, the assistance to the [inaudible] is quite a different issue.   Assistance is provided to Australians offshore in relation to  defending criminal proceedings, subject to a, a means;  substantially [inaudible], and those matters tend to follow an  application [inaudible] before the aid is provided.  But, it’s well known that the Australian Government has provided  assistance, and we would do so in criminal matters regardless of  the person who needs [inaudible].  Okay?   

 Ends
