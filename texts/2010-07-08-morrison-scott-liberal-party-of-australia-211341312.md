 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 More policy on the run as Gillard seeks  asylum from her own policy   08/07/10  

 Julia Gillard’s claim that a regional processing centre in East Timor was never part of  the plan she announced just two days ago, shows just how desperate she has become  as her asylum policy thought bubble has popped, according to Scott Morrison,  Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. 

 Mr Morrison said “Julia Gillard’s plan has unravelled within days, and she continues  to make policy on the run. The regional processing centre is a thought bubble that has  well and truly popped.” 

 “Julia Gillard is now resorting to deceit and cover up in an attempt to paper over the  credibility chasm that has opened up for Labor on border protection and asylum  seeker policy under her leadership. 

 “The attempt by the Prime Minister to rewrite two-day old history, hiding behind  weasel words that her predecessor was famous for, clearly shows that nothing has  changed under Julia Gillard’s leadership. 

 “The Prime Minister knowingly led everyone in Australia to believe that her plan was  to build a new processing centre in East Timor. The only thing missing at the speech  was the usual hard hat and luminous vest she uses when she tours her bungled BER  programme. 

 “This episode shows once again that Labor simply can’t be trusted when it comes to  implementing policies on border protection and immigration. 

 “Julia Gillard’s L plate diplomacy and brazen political self interest has been exposed  by her bungling of this issue, demonstrating she is just not up to fixing the mess Labor  has created on border protection under her and Labor’s policies” he said.
