  Care needs to be taken when comparing monthly or cumulative data across years, and to full year estimates, since factors such as the introduction of The New Tax System and the accrual framework, and the timing of  payments and policy decisions can have a large impact on fiscal aggregates from one year to the next and on year to date outcomes.

  FISCAL OUTCOMES UNDERLYING CASH BALANCE

  The  main  components  of  the  underlying  cash  balance  are  cash  from  operations  and  movements  in  the  net investment in non-financial assets.

  The underlying cash balance for the year to date 30 April 2002 was a deficit of $2,287 million. This was a $6,498 million improvement on the March 2002 position. The strengthening in the underlying cash balance is largely due to  stronger  taxation  collections  for  the  month  of  April,  as  anticipated,  with  the  receipt  of  the  March  quarter Business Activity Statement (BAS) and annual Fringe Benefits Tax payments.

  The underlying cash balance as at the end of April 2002 is lower than a pro-rata of the revised Budget estimate (which equals a deficit of $994 million).  The main factors contributing to the difference are:

  â¢ while taxation collections are in line with expectations they are lower than a pro-rata of the Budget estimates as the final quarter is the strongest collection period for taxation receipts;

  â¢ higher  grant  payments  due  to  payments  in  relation  to  a  number  of  education  grants  that  are  made  at  the commencement of the academic year;

  â¢ higher interest on debt payments largely due to increases in interest rates; and

  â¢ higher subsidies payments relating to residential care prepayments.

  Partially offset by

  â¢ lower  personal  benefits  payments  due  to  seasonal  demand  for  the  Pharmaceutical  Benefits  Scheme  and Medicare  Benefits.  Based  on  historical  data,  demand  is  expected  to  increase  in  the  final  months  of  the financial year;

  â¢ lower  grant  payments  due  to  a  slower  rate  of  submission  of  requests  and  subsequent  assessment  of  health grants including for population health, blood products and transfusion services, primary care and home and community care;

  â¢ lower grant payments in relation to National Highway and Roads of National Importance Programme and the Roads to Recovery Programme due to a higher level of payments on road infrastructure projects scheduled for May and June, and in relation to lower than estimated emergencies under the Natural Disaster and Relief Arrangements Programme;

  â¢ lower  suppliers  payments  reflecting  seasonal  patterns  in  Defence  purchasing  whereby  higher  monthly payments  are  made  in  the  last  quarter  of  the  financial  year.   Defence  expect  suppliers  payments  to  be consistent with the revised Budget estimate by the end of the financial year; and

  â¢ lower  suppliers payments relating to large expenses such as the Tax Pack expected to be made towards the end of the financial year.

  Investing  cash  receipts  are  also  lower  than  a  pro-rata  of  the  revised  Budget  estimate  reflecting  that  the  sale  of some non-financial assets are still to occur later in the financial year including sale of properties in the ACT by CSIRO.  This is partially offset by the lower level of purchases of property, plant and equipment by Defence and the construction of an immigration reception and processing centre on Christmas Island.

  FISCAL BALANCE

  The fiscal balance for the year to date 30 April 2002 was a deficit of $1,694 million, a $6,255 million improvement on March 2002. The main components of the fiscal balance are the GFS net operating balance, which was a deficit of $2,011 million, and negative net capital investment of $317 million for the year to date 30 April 2002 (refer to the Reconciliation of AAS31 Operating Result to Fiscal Balance for further detail).

  FINANCIAL OUTCOMES

  OPERATING RESULT

  The  operating  result  for  the  year  to  date  30  April  2002  was  a  deficit  of  $1,151  million,  a  $6,168  million improvement  on  March  2002.  The  improvement  largely  reflects  the  stronger  revenue  position  due  to  the collection of quarterly Business Activity Statements and annual Fringe Benefits Tax payments.  This position is expected to continue to strengthen with taxation revenues received towards the end of the financial year.

  REVENUES

  Total revenue for the year to date 30 April 2002 was  $138,424 million, comprising $124,405 million in taxation revenue and $14,019 million in non-tax revenue.

  The  main  components  in  taxation  revenue  were  PAYG(W)  ($65,985  million,  including  residual  payments  of $60  million  and  $23  million  from  the  now  discontinued  PAYE  and  Prescribed  Payments  Systems  respectively), companies ($24,279 million) and excise duty ($16,551 million), and individuals refunds which reduced net revenue by ($9,682 million).

  The introduction of The New Tax System affects both the timing and quantity of taxation revenue received by the Commonwealth compared to previous years.

  EXPENSES

  Total expenses for the year to date 30 April 2002 were $139,575 million, which is 3 per cent below a pro-rata of the revised Budget estimate of $143,383 million.  Expenses for the year to date are not always directly comparable to full year estimates due to seasonal effects on Commonwealth administered expenses.

  Factors affecting expenses are outlined below (including their impact by Function):

  â¢ lower  suppliers  expenses  reflecting  seasonal  patterns  in  Defence  purchasing  whereby  higher  monthly expenditure  is  recorded  in  the  last  quarter  of  the  financial  year.  Defence  expect  suppliers  expenses  to  be consistent  with  the  revised  Budget  estimate  by  the  end  of  the  financial  year.  (These  expenses  are  primarily included in the Defence function);

  â¢ lower  suppliers  expenses  due  to  large  expenses  such  as  the  Tax  Pack  are  planned  towards  the  end  of  the financial year.  (These expenses are in the General Public Services function);

  â¢ lower  depreciation  expenses  for  Defence  which  are  expected  to  increase  once  stocktakes  and  asset revaluations occur towards the end of the year.  (These expenses are included in the Defence function);

  â¢ lower expenses relating to the corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric Authority as this is not expected to occur until later in the financial year.  (These expenses are in the Fuel and Energy function);

  â¢ lower other goods and services expense due to delays in contract payments, claims processing and receipt of invoices for AusAid’s country programmes. (These are in the General Public Services function);

  â¢ lower grant expenses:

  â’ in  relation  to  National  Highway  and  Roads  of  National  Importance  Programme  and  the  Roads  to Recovery Programme largely due to a high level of expenditure on road infrastructure projects scheduled for May and June.   Also in relation to lower than estimated emergencies under the Natural Disaster and Relief  Arrangements  Programme.   (These  grant  expenses  are  in  the  Transport  and  Communication function);

  â’ due to the slower rate of submission of requests and subsequent assessment of health grants including for population health, blood products and transfusion services, primary care and home and community care. (These grant expenses are in the Health and Social Security and Welfare functions) and;

  â’ as negotiations relating to Australia’s contribution to the International Development Association (IDA) and other international health and refugee organisations are yet to be concluded.  (These grant expenses are in the General Public Services function).

  â¢ lower personal benefits expenses due to seasonal demand for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Medicare Benefits and Newstart Allowance. (These personal benefits are in the Health and Social Security and Welfare functions); and

  31 May 2002 Contact: Office of the Minister for Finance and Administration (02) 6277 7400

  4

  â¢ lower  personal  benefits  expenses  for  the  disability  support  pension  because  of  the  anticipated  pattern  of growth  in  the  pension  over  the  course  of  the  year.  In  addition,  age  pension  expenses  are  below  estimate because of lower than projected growth in new recipients.

  Offset by:

  â¢ higher suppliers expenses relating to the Special Employee Entitlements Scheme for Ansett employees.  Most of the claims expected under this scheme have already been made.  (These suppliers expenses are in the Other Economic Affairs function); and

  â¢ higher  grant  expenses  for  schools  (Government  and  Non-Government),  higher  education  and  vocational education training as the funding is recognised on a calendar year basis.  (The majority of grant expenses are in the General Public Services function).

  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

  The net asset balance within the General Government sector has improved from a negative net asset position of $46,305  million  at  30  June  2001  to  a  negative  net  asset  position  of  $39,706  million  at  30  April  2002.  This  was primarily the result of a reduction in debt on Government securities.

  NOTES:

  With  the  introduction  of  Business  Activity  Statements  and  Instalment  Activity  Statements  last  financial  year, taxpayers provide information on payments associated with several types of tax when lodging the statement and paying the aggregate net tax amount. Thus, while total tax collections are known with certainty at the end of each month, the distribution across the relevant heads of revenue cannot be finalised until all statements are received and  processed.   The  outcomes  for  some  revenue  items  provided  in  this  statement  are  thus  estimates,  in accordance  with  the  best  judgement  of  the  Taxation  Commissioner,  and  subject  to  revision.  The  taxation revenue  items  not  affected  are:  Other  withholding  tax,  Petroleum  Resource  Rent  Tax,  Excise  duty,  Customs duty, Other Taxes and Individuals Refunds.

  The sum of the revenue accrued in the month and the revisions to prior periods equals the revenue reported in the Statement of Revenue and Expenses.

  All taxation items in these notes are reported on an AAS31 basis.

  In regard to GST revenue, AAS31 and other relevant accounting standards would suggest the gross amount of GST be included in the Commonwealth’s Financial Statements. However, the clear policy intent of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations is that the GST is a State tax collected by the Commonwealth in an agency capacity. Therefore, accrued GST revenues and associated payments to the States and Territories are not disclosed in these statements.
