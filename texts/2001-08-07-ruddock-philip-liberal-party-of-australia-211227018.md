 Approval Rate for Boat Asylum Seekers Falls MPS 112/2001

 The overall approval rate of asylum applications from people arriving illegally in Australia by boat has fallen significantly, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock said today.

 Of the unauthorised boat arrivals who came to Australia in 1999-2000, there was an average approval rate of 94 per cent.

 "That figure dropped significantly for unauthorised boat arrivals in the July - December 2000 period, where the overall grant rate had fallen to an average of 75 per cent," Mr Ruddock said.

 "This reflects the changing profile of the arrivals and updated information available to assess the claims being made.

 "The downward trend in approval rates for boat arrivals also demonstrates that Australia is achieving greater success in detecting more people whose claims are false.

 "The abuse of asylum systems was clearly demonstrated by the boat recently intercepted in Cambodia on its way to Australia with 242 people on board.

 "A large number of those on the boat said that on arrival in Australia they would claim to be fleeing Afghanistan, but were subsequently found not to be Afghan citizens despite carrying Afghan passports.

 "More than half of the 242 indicated that they lived in Pakistan, Iran and the Gulf States. Several had never lived in Afghanistan at all. All but four had return tickets to Pakistan or the UAE, suggesting they had right of re-entry to those countries," Mr Ruddock said.

 Mr Ruddock said they would have disposed of their documents before arriving in Australia to misrepresent their identity and nationality in order to abuse the refugee process.

 "Many are not fleeing persecution. They are trying to migrate."

 The Minister said it was deeply regrettable that Australia's ability to take the most urgent cases - those languishing in refugee camps - was under threat by people who bypassed the normal resettlement processes offshore by paying criminals to bring them to Australia.

 Eds Note: Figures for Jan-June 2001 are not yet available because people will still be in the assessment process - 80% of cases receive a primary decision in less than 15 weeks.
