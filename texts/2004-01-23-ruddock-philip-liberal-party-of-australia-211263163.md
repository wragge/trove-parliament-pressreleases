 LABOR CONFIRMS UNWINDING OF BORDER PROTECTION 

 The Labor Party has confirmed its approach of unwinding Australia’s border  protection policies the Attorney-General Philip Ruddock said today. 

 “Labor’s policy is based on a ‘meet and greet’ approach to people smugglers and  their clients,” Mr Ruddock said. 

 “The Opposition Leader has said nothing about supporting the very successful  policy of interdicting and where possible, returning boats to their origin. 

 “It appears Labor will no longer use off-shore processing and has signalled that  people arriving unlawfully will quickly achieve their goal of seeking a permanent  migration outcome in Australia. 

 “In taking this approach, the Labor Party is advocating a system which will bring  unauthorised arrivals onshore, increasing the likelihood of people accessing  Australia’s court system. 

 “The courts are already facing difficulties with increasing workloads in the migration  area and a growing proportion of unmeritorious cases. 

 “Clearly, Australia’s approach has been very successful with very few unauthorised  arrivals on our borders in the past two years. 

 “Labor’s approach will encourage the organisers who are still active in other  countries, to start looking at sending boats and clients our way again. 

 “While the Government increased the penalties for people smuggling some time ago,  the strongest signal that can be sent to the organisers and their clients is one that  demonstrates they will not achieve their outcome. 

 “Welcoming boats to Australia and giving their passengers residence after two years  is not going to send the right signal to the organisers watching from abroad,” Mr  Ruddock said.
