 TRANSCRIPT 

 Jenny Macklin MP  Deputy Leader of the Opposition   Shadow Minister for Education, Training, Science & Research  Federal Member for Jagajaga                                               

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - Parliament House, Canberra  19/10/2006   

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY   

    Subjects:   Maoism in the HSC;  SIEV X drownings; Iraq.   

 Macklin: A new investigation has just been done of the NSW HSC English curriculum by  the Australian Council of Educational Research. Unlike Julie Bishop, John Howard’s  Education Minister, they find no hint of Maoism. I’d really say to the Howard  Government it’s time to stop playing politics and concentrate on the education of our  children. 

 

 Journalist: Julie Bishop got slapped down though when she suggested that a couple of  weeks ago, pretty comprehensively.   

 Macklin: And that needs to continue to happen because what she is doing is really  continuing to play politics with our children’s education rather than making sure that we  do have nationally consistent high standards around the country. Let’s get some real  effort to increase the educational standards in Australia rather than the constant political  swiping that goes on from the Howard Government. Yesterday we saw another example  of it, the Howard Government was scouting for people to present themselves as  electricians in an advertisement. They were going to get paid $500 an hour. Well a real  apprentice electrician only gets paid, the minimum is only $6.37 an hour. So, once again  just more evidence of spin from the Howard Government, no substance when it comes to  making sure that we’ve got decent training happening in this country and yet another  example today from NSW of Julie Bishop being caught out once again playing politics.  No substance, all spin.   

 Journalist: Do you think it is appropriate for students to learn about the SIEV X  drownings in history classes?   

 Macklin: It’s extraordinary isn’t it, the Howard Government doesn’t want to be held  responsible for the mess it has made in Iraq, they don’t want to be held responsible for  the mess they are making to industrial relations, they don’t want to be held responsible  for the mess they are making in immigration, they don’t want to be held responsible for  anything. Well history will judge the Howard Government for the significant mess they  have made in this country and history will tell the story. 

 

 Journalist: Is it appropriate for students to be taught about the SIEV X or for the SIEV X  to be used as a case study for the HSC?   

 Macklin: As I’ve just said, history will judge this Government. History will judge what  this Government has done, the mess they have made in Iraq, the mess they’ve made to  Industrial Relations, the mess they have made in immigration, and so the list goes on. Of  course, history will judge them severely for these extraordinary failures.

 Journalist: But yes or no, do you think of it as appropriate?   

 Macklin: As I’ve said history will judge this Government. It is a matter of history, the  mess that they have made.   

 Journalist: If a school was to put it on a test paper or on a class curriculum would you  have any objections?   

 Macklin: What is important is that History papers look at all aspects of what goes on in  our society and I have no doubt that history will judge this Government severely when  you look at the mess they have made in so many areas. The mess they have made in Iraq,  the mess they have made in Industrial Relations, the mess they have made in  immigration.   

 Journalist: Part of the case study asks students whether the Howard Government refugee  and immigration policies played a part in the SIEV X disaster. Is that appropriate for  Australia’s school curriculum? 

 

 Macklin: It’s important that students are asked to look across these issues. To understand  the full gamut of what goes on in any matter that is to do with our history. The whole, the  good and the bad, needs to be looked at. But the critical issue here is that the Howard  Government never wants to come clean, they never want to come clean on the mess  they’ve made. Whether it is in Iraq, whether it is in immigration whatever the mess they 

 have made, they don’t want to come clean about it. Well history will judge them.   

 Journalist: Are you offended by suggestions that Labor’s policy on Iraq is cowardly?   

 Macklin: What I’m offended by is this Government continuing to dig a hole deeper and  deeper when it comes to Iraq. What I’m offended by is this Government not realising that  it would be better for this country if we were to get out of Iraq.   

 Journalist: Do you feel that some in the Government denigrate people who hold an  opposition to the war by labelling them as cowards?   

 Macklin: That’s typical of Alexander Downer to hurl around abuse. It’s a bit like what we  are seeing from Julie Bishop on curriculum. It’s typical of this Government to play  politics, to play the man, rather than to address the critical issue.
