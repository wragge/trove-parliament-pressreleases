 Michael Keenan 

 Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection 

 Gillard refuses to let facts get in the way  of her story, as another boat arrives   07/07/10  

 Labor's decision to delay the announcement of another illegal boat arrival yesterday  afternoon, until more than 24 hours later shows just why Labor can't be trusted when  it comes to border protection, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship,  Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, 

 Michael Keenan said today. 

 “Julia Gillard clearly didn't want any facts to get in the way of her story today. News  of the latest illegal boat arrival, on the previous day, was not released until the Prime  Minister had left her media visit to Northern Command in Darwin today and after she  had completed all interviews for the day,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “With a backbench Labor marginal seat holder flown all the way from Penrith to  Darwin, the Prime Minister posed for photographs with defence force personnel in an  attempt her sell her knee jerk announcement on border protection. 

 “The Prime Minister said she wanted an honest and open debate on asylum seekers,  based on the facts, yet within days, these facts were buried for at least 24 hours so as  not to spoil her prefabricated story for tonight's TV news. 

 “Julia Gillard's attempt to manipulate the media today would make even Kevin Rudd  blush. 

 “This cynical exercise shows that Julia Gillard is more interested in stopping bad  headlines for the Government than stopping the unprecedented flow of illegal boat  arrivals that have occurred under her policies. 

 “One hundred and forty four boats carrying more than 6,800 people have now arrived  on Labor's watch. Labor has no policy to fix the mess that they have created. 

 “It would be generous to describe Julia Gillard's announcement on border protection  as half baked, let alone a policy. The response from East Timor and the absence of  any formal proposal or dialogue shows that it's yet to even go in the oven. 

 “Labor's knee jerk response is just another election eve fix that demonstrates why  Labor cannot be trusted to deliver on border protection. No asylum seekers will ever  be processed in East Timor under a Gillard Government. 

 “Only the Coalition has the proven policies and resolve to do what is necessary to  stop the unprecedented arrival of boats to Australia,” he said. 

 Mr Keenan said: “No matter what Labor says, they will always be soft on border  protection because they have no conviction on this issue. 

 “Julia Gillard had an opportunity yesterday to prove to the Australian people that she  is committed to ending the horrible trade of people smuggling; instead she resorted to  the usual Labor strategy of selling spin over substance. 

 “As the East Timor option falls apart within 24 hours, Ms Gillard has showed herself  to be no different than her predecessor when it comes to protecting Australia’s  borders. 

 “We have made it clear that a Coalition Government will commit to real action, and  return to the policies that have worked in the past. 

 “Today we have proof that only a Coalition Government has the resolve to take real  action and stop the boats from coming,” he said.
