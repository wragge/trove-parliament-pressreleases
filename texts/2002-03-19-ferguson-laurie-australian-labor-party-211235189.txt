  MEDIA RELEASE 

  19 March 2002 

  AUSTRALIANS STAND UP FOR MULTICULTURALISM  ON HARMONY DAY 

  ‘Labor is firmly committed to multiculturalism and Government claims to the contrary  are about as truthful as their claim that children were thrown overboard on 7‘h  October last year,’ the Shadow Minister for Multicultural Affairs, Laurie Ferguson MP  said today. 

  ‘I welcome the support displayed by many businesses, councils, community  organisations and ordinary Australians for Harmony Day on 21 March (this  Thursday). 

  ‘This keen support clearly demonstrates a willingness by many people of goodwill to  take a stand against racism, prejudice and intolerance and to celebrate our cultural,  ethnic and religious diversity. 

  ‘Harmony Day is held on 21 March each year and is a demonstration of  multiculturalism in action. It coincides with the long-established and vital United  Nations hternational Day for the Elimination of Racism. There are of course many  views about how best to celebrate diversity and to progress anti-racism initiatives. 

  ‘My own very multicultural electorate of Reid is home to people from a wide range of  backgrounds, ranging from the descendants of nineteenth century German  winegrowers to white Russians from Harbin, from the now established Turks and  Vietnamese to today’s Afghan and Iraqi refugees. It will host a number of major 

  Harmony Day events at Auburn, Homebush Bay and Merrylands. 

  ‘It is significant that this week also marks the arrival of our six millionth migrant since  1945. Almost one-quarter of the Australian population was born overseas, with tens  of thousands of others having at least one parent who was born overseas.

  ‘Historically the Coalition Parties have sought to dissemble on multiculturalism and  use it as a weapon to attack the ALP. 

  ‘Indeed the Government’s 1998 election policy statement on immigration, reflecting  John Howard’s outdated worldview, suggested that the policy of multiculturalism “was  transforming Australia into a nation of tribes”. 

  ‘The community owes a debt of gratitude to businessman Neville Roach and his  colleagues on the then National Multicultural Advisory Council whose April 1999  report persuaded a reluctant Coalition to formally commit itself to multiculturalism in  the form of its New Agenda for Multicultural Australia. 

  ‘Given this record it is time Ministers Ruddock and Hardgrave stopped churning out  statements questioning Labor’s commitment to multiculturalism,’ Mr Ferguson  concluded.
