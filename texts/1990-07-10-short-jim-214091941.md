 SUCCESSFUL ASYLUM SEEKERS - ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT SERVICES

 Today's Cabinet decision to grant a range of services  including Special Benefit, Family Allowance, Family  Allowance Supplement, Medicare, Labor Market Programs and  English language training and education to Chinese Nationals 

 in Australia before June 20, will have significant Budget  implications.

 After several week's deliberations, it is extraordinary  that Government Ministers have not given any estimate of  the cost to revenue of access to this range of services.

 If the Opposition's approach of case-by-case determination  of Chinese Nationals' claims were pursued, the Budget  implications would be less significant - additional  resources for testing the eligibility for refugee and  special humanitarian programs is a less costly option.

 In response to our questioning, the Finance Minister's  office now claims the net additional costs in 1990/91 will  be only $5 million. This figure is said by Mr Willis'  office to be derived as follows:

 Gross costs $50 million

 Less cost of access to labor market programs to be absorbed within existing program cash  limits $27 million

 Subtotal $23 million

 Less "saving" to Social Security system from reduction ' in migrant intake to take account of Chinese students $18 million

 Total $ 5 million

 PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY  MICAH

 This arithmetic cannot be believed:

 * The $50 million appears to be a considerable  underestimate

 * The $27 million is a wild guess - in any event, it is  unlikely to be accommodated within existing cash  limits for labor market programs

 * The $18 million "saving" is simply wrong - many of the  14,000 migrants who would have come to Australia in  1990/91, had the Chinese student situation not arisen,  would not have been eligible for many of these Social 

 Security benefits in 1990/91.

 This decision and the method of its announcement  demonstrates once again the incompetence of the Government,   both in its decision-making and in its administration.

 Mr Hand and Mr Willis have a sorry track record of  incompetence in their previous portfolios.  Today's  announcement strengthens this deplorable record.
