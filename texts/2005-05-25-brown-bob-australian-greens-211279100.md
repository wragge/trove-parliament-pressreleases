 Senator Bob Brown   Senator for Tasmania   Wednesday, 25 May 2005    

 Greens will help foster Liberals move in the  Senate    

 Greens Senator Bob Brown has welcomed moves by Liberal  backbenchers to introduce private members bills to reform Australia’s  asylum seeker regime.    

 “The Greens want to help foster the legislation in the Senate.  If no  Liberal introduces the legislation into the Senate we are ready to do  so.    

 “The Labor party also needs to back these humane and circuit-breaking bills from the Liberals.      

 “John Howard should allow all his backbench a conscience vote.    

 “We have seen before what impact Liberals can have when they  threaten to cross the floor.      

 “John Howard was forced to act on the Northern Territory’s mandatory  sentencing regime, which locked up Aboriginal children for stealing  biscuits, when backbenchers signalled their intention to vote for the  Greens private members bill in 1999-2000,” Senator Brown said.
