 Australian Citizenship Day,  legislation to restore Migration Act  powers, Opposition briefing,  offshore processing Saturday, 17 September 2011

 Doorstop interview, Smithfield

 Chris Bowen: Thanks for coming, everybody.

 Firstly, let me just recognise that today is Citizenship Day:  across the country 4000 people becoming Australian  citizens; the tenth Citizenship Day that we've celebrated in  Australia. It's a great opportunity to celebrate what it is to be  Australian and to celebrate the many thousands, indeed  millions, of people who've taken the citizenship pledge over  the years.

 Secondly, of course, last night the Opposition was provided  with a briefing and provided with draft legislation to  implement the government's intention to legislate to make it  clear the wish of the Parliament for offshore processing.  This is an important week. People smugglers are watching.  They're watching to see if Tony Abbott blinks. They're  watching to see if Australia blinks. They're watching to see  if we are committed to a regional framework with offshore  processing or not. So this is a very important week.

 Both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party believe in  offshore processing. The Australian people look to their  political leaders to sort out their differences. The Australian  people, knowing that both political parties support offshore  processing, are looking to their political leaders to sit down  and make sure that that policy is implemented. We have  different approaches to offshore processing: the Liberal  Party believes in Nauru; the Labor Party believes in the  Malaysia arrangement as part of the regional framework.  What's important here is that the government of the day

 have the ability to implement its policies. Mr Abbott said a  couple of weeks ago he believed in that. Mr Abbott said that  he thought the government of the day should be able to  implement its policies. This week we'll find out if he sticks to  that.

 This is about the risk of offshore processing not occurring.  The legal advice is clear - despite some comments I've  seen as late as this morning - that offshore processing  cannot occur in any way and with any certainty without the  Parliament passing legislation. That applies to Papua New  Guinea, it applies to Nauru, it applies to Malaysia, it applies  to any other place. Mr Abbott shouldn't risk offshore  processing. He should work with the Prime Minister, work  with the government in good faith to see legislation passed  and legislation passed soon.

 Happy to take any questions.

 Journalist: Minister, even after last night's briefing, Tony  Abbott says he's still under the impression that processing  can take place in Nauru. How do you think he came to that?

 Bowen: Well, the only people who think that processing  can occur legally on Nauru is the Liberal Party. We have  five QCs - Gageler, Lloyd, Kennett, Estcourt and Merkel -  who all say that there is very significant doubt about the law  in relation to Nauru and that it would almost certainly be  challenged. Some legal advice is even stronger than the  Solicitor-General's advice. Some legal advice, some of  those QCs have said that they have very significant  concerns that Nauru could ever be operated legally under  the High Court ruling.

 Now, the Liberal Party needs to listen to that. The Liberal  Party can't live in fantasy land and pretend that offshore  processing is legal when it's not. The Liberal Party needs to 

 come to terms with the fact that the expert legal advice is  clear and consistent, and they need in turn to support  legislation to make the situation crystal clear.

 Journalist: Why do you hope to strip the Act so that you no  longer have to provide that assurance that asylum seekers'  rights will be protected?

 Bowen: Look, I think it's appropriate that the minister of the  day, regardless of the political party in office, have the

 capacity to weigh up the issues and to make a  determination in the public interest. The minister should be  held accountable for that; the minister should report back to  Parliament, as the bill provides for the minister to explain  the reasons to justify the position. Of course, it's important  that ministers weigh up everything in the public interest, and  in relation to offshore processing, it's important that  ministers be held accountable.

 Now, this is draft legislation that we are putting forward. If  people have constructive suggestions that they want to  make and they want to make those in good faith, then we'll  deal with them in good faith. But the situation is clear:  offshore processing as it currently stands is not lawful in  any meaningful sense after the High Court's decision.  Professor Rothwell, for example, has said New Zealand  would be the only country in which offshore processing can  occur in our region. That's not sustainable. We need to  have a lot more legal certainty and the Australian people  are looking to their political leaders to sort it out.

 Journalist: What do you think the Labor Government is  going to have to do to be able to get the Opposition onside?

 Bowen: Well, look, that's a matter for Mr Abbott. We've said  we've invited Mr Abbott to a meeting on Monday. The Prime  Minister's invited Mr Abbott to that meeting. They'll sit down  and if Mr Abbott is fair dinkum, if he's prepared to work in  good faith with the government, then that is what the  Australian people will be looking for. This is a chance for  Australia's two major political parties that believe in offshore  processing to work together to achieve it. I think that's what  the Australian people expect. I think they expect there to be  a difference of views but they expect the Australian leaders  to be able to sit down and work through those issues.

 Journalist: But what protections would there be for the  rights of asylum seekers, their human rights overseas, if  you don't have to provide that explicit assurance?

 Bowen: Look, let me make a couple of points. Now, firstly,  our position is the Malaysia arrangement, which has got  those human rights protections built into it, this is an  arrangement where Malaysia has agreed to treat people  with dignity and respect. To answer your question, we  believe in those things; the Liberal Party does not.

 [Interrupted by protesters]

 Clearly, this is a very controversial issue.

 [Interrupted by protesters]

 Do we have any more questions?

 Journalist: Yeah, we do.

 [Interrupted by protesters]

 Bowen: I'm happy to let the democratic process unfold and  to answer the media's questions.

 [Interrupted by protesters]

 I'm happy to sit down and have a rational discussion with  people.

 [Interrupted by protesters]

 Journalist: Folks, if you wouldn't mind, we might just  continue on with a few questions. Is that all right?

 [Interrupted by protesters]

 Bowen: You've had your say, I'm answering media  questions. You're entitled to protest; I have no problem with  that.

 [Interrupted by protesters]

 Journalist: What you do is up to you, but we would like to  keep asking the minister some questions. So we might just  keep doing that, if that's okay.

 Minister, how is what you're proposing now stripping away  the need for you to give those explicit guarantees for  people's rights? How is that any better than what Tony  Abbott is proposing for Nauru?

 Bowen: Well, what Tony Abbott's policy is is to turn the  boats around on the high seas and point them towards  Indonesia: not a refugee signatory country, with no  protections built in, no guarantees, no undertakings, no  conditions in relation to processing and non-refoulement.  His other policy is, of course, Nauru: not a country which

 the UNHCR has endorsed as being appropriate to receive  refugees under the regional framework. Our proposal,  worked through with the UNHCR, is for those conditions  and protections to be built in.

 [Interrupted by protesters]

 Journalist: That's for the Malaysia solution itself, the one  that you've built in, but this gives rise to the potential for lots  of other deals?

 Bowen: Well, the government of the day should have the  power to implement its policy.

 [Interrupted by protesters]

 The government of the day should have the capacity to  introduce its policies, to be accountable to Parliament to do  so. That's what our legislation proposes. As I've said, if  there are constructive suggestions as to that legislation,  we'll be happy to work those through in good faith with  people proposing them in good faith.

 [Interrupted by protesters]

 Journalist: What sort of legal advice did you get to make  these amendments?

 Bowen: Well, of course we've worked it through very solidly  with our legal advisers and of course we believe -

 Journalist: But what sort of advice did they give you?

 Bowen: Well, they gave us advice on the various options,  of course, and we've accepted that advice.

 [Interrupted by protesters]

 Journalist: This morning the Shadow Immigration Minister  said that he's worried human rights won't be looked after.

 [Interrupted by protesters]

 I'm trying to ask a question; I can't if you're talking over the  top of me, thank you.

 The Shadow Immigration Minister was worried about  human rights if the proposed draft legislation goes ahead?

 Bowen: Well, I don't think the Liberal Party's concerns  about human rights, when you consider their policies, can  be taken as being completely without question.

 [Interrupted by protesters]

 Journalist: This really does go against the spirit of the Act  [inaudible], it really does. It may be legal, but it circumvents  [inaudible].

 Bowen: Well, the Parliament has the opportunity to make  its laws. We live in a situation where the Parliament can  make laws authorising executive action and that is what  we're proposing.

 [Interrupted by protesters]

 Journalist: It doesn't look like the Coalition's going to  support it, nor the Greens?

 Bowen: Well, that's a matter for them. The Greens' position  is clear. It's a matter for the Coalition. We'll have a meeting  on Monday; we'll work through the issues if they are  prepared to work through the issues with us.

 [Interrupted by protesters]

 Mr Rintoul, you are entitled to your opinion. I'm entitled to  mine and that's appropriate.

 [Interrupted by protesters]

 Are there any more questions from the media?

 Journalist: Are there any options for any extensions of the  deal with Malaysia?

 Bowen: I've made it clear, as the Malaysian Government  has made it clear, that we are prepared to review it after it's  been implemented in terms of extending it further.

 [Interrupted by protesters]

 Journalist: Minister, is there a Plan B or perhaps a Plan C?

 Bowen: Let's implement Plan A. Let's let the Parliament  give us the opportunity to implement Plan A.
