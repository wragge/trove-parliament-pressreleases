 MINISTER’S FOREWORD 

 One of the key commitments of the Abbott Government is to  reduce the size of government and to ensure that government  services are as efficient and well-targeted as possible. 

 The Smaller Government initiatives announced in the 2014-15  Federal Budget are part of a methodical ongoing effort to reduce  the total number of Australian Government bodies. These  decisions build on steps taken shortly after the 2013 election to abolish unnecessary  advisory bodies and boards, take steps towards our first major privatisation and  abolish a number of agencies including statutory authorities.    

 Commonwealth bodies play a vital role in advising the Government, delivering public  services and enforcing the law. However across the Commonwealth we have too many  inefficient and complex structures, which create costs that should be avoidable. In  some areas we are investing in bodies that are adding marginal value or are  duplicating each other or other levels of government.   

 The National Commission of Audit was asked to consider opportunities to streamline  government structures and identify improvements that would ensure greater value for  taxpayers’ money. The recommendations and reform principles proposed by the  Commission provided an important input into designing smaller government reforms.  

 Many of these reforms will preserve delivery of the same range of services, but will  ensure that overly-bureaucratic structures are simplified where possible. Where we  have consolidated functions into government departments or merged smaller bodies  into larger agencies, this will enhance lines of accountability. 

 The reforms we have implemented following the election and those announced in the  2014-15 Budget will achieve ongoing savings and greatly simplify the structures of  government in several areas. But it is important to acknowledge that the number of  Australian Government bodies still remains high and more can be done to further  rationalise bodies and find other efficiencies. 

 A third phase of reductions and consolidations will take place ahead of the next   Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, following further due diligence on additional  reform options. The Abbott Government is facing up to the structural challenges that  have been ignored for too long.

 DELIVERING A SMALLER AND MORE RATIONAL  GOVERNMENT FOOTPRINT 

 PHASING OF REFORM 

 The Abbott Government is undertaking reforms to reduce the number of government  bodies further and make the operations of remaining public sector organisations more  efficient. 

 We recognise that it is important to get the policy settings right for a leaner and more  business-like administration.  

 Reforms to remove or amalgamate government bodies will be implemented in a  methodical and phased approach. 

 ï· The first phase of reform was implemented prior to the 2014 Budget, including  Machinery of Government reforms in September 2013 and initiatives included  in the December 2013 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. This included  shifting the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) into  the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT); combining the  Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism into the Department of  Industry and DFAT; merging the functions of the Department of Regional  Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport into other departments;  abolishing 23 advisory bodies; and commencing the process to sell Medibank  Private. The full list of phase one reforms is at Appendix A.   

 ï· Altogether decisions taken pre-budget have resulted in a reduction of 40  government bodies.    

 ï· In the 2014-15 Budget the Abbott Government announced the second phase of  reform, that will result in abolition of another 36 government bodies.  Details  of these reforms are listed at Appendix B. These reductions will be achieved  through closures, mergers and consolidations of functions into departments.   

 ï· The Government will also commission scoping studies to consider the future  of five bodies, assessing new delivery options including privatisation.   

 ï· The third phase of consolidation of the number of government bodies will be  announced as part of the 2014-15 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook.    

 ï· To support better decision-making and limit the creation of new government  bodies in the future, an Australian Government Governance Policy will be  released in the second half of 2014.   

 3 

 Together phase one and two of the Smaller Government agenda will affect 88  government bodies plus three proposed bodies that the previous Government had  provided funding for. These decisions will result in the abolition of 76 bodies. 

 ï· Some 16 of these reforms involve consolidation of functions from abolished  bodies into government departments.  

 ï· Another 25 bodies are to be merged into other types of government bodies. 

 ï· One privatisation has been commenced and five scoping studies have been  announced that may result in further privatisations.  

 Acting early to deliver a smaller and more rational government footprint will  contribute to fiscal repair and to the sustainability of government operations.

 NEW INITIATIVES 

 Reductions to the number of government bodies 

 The Government is taking strong and early action to reduce the footprint of the public  sector.  The 2014-15 Budget contains a number of measures that reduce the number of  Australian Government bodies and streamline the shape of government. These  reforms are detailed at Appendix B.  

 The 2014-15 Budget includes proposals affecting 48 government bodies plus two  proposed bodies that the previous Government had committed to establishing. In  summary: 

 ï· In this second phase of reform the Government will abolish 36 government  bodies and stop the creation of a further two bodies.   

 ï· The reforms will merge back-office functions of another seven bodies.    

 ï· Scoping studies will be sought on a further five bodies. 

 The abolition of 36 bodies in the 2014-15 Budget will be achieved through the  following changes.  

 ï· Cessation of 10 bodies including: the Abalone Aquaculture Health  Accreditation Workshop, the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation, the  Australian Renewable Energy Agency, the Australian River Co. Limited, the  Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee and its legal committee, the  National Water Commission, the COAG Reform Council, the Office of the  Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the Prime Minister’s  Indigenous Business Policy Advisory Group. 

 ï· Consolidating the functions of several bodies into Departments.  

 - The most significant of these reforms will consolidate the Australian  Customs and Border Protection Service into the Department of  Immigration and Border Protection to form a single operational border  agency.  

 - The functions of Health Workforce Australia, General Practice Education  and Training Limited and the Australian National Preventive Health  Agency, will be consolidated into the Department of Health. 

 - The functions of the Telecommunications Universal Service Management  Agency will be consolidated into the Department of Communications. 

 5 

 - The roles of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Selection  Committee and Wine Australia Corporation Selection Committee will be  subsumed in the Department of Agriculture. 

 ï· A number of mergers will bring together the complementary expertise of  related bodies that are working in related fields. 

 - Comsuper will merge into the Commonwealth Superannuation  Corporation. 

 - Five civilian merit review tribunals will be amalgamated into a single  organisation including: the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the  Classification Review Board, the Migration Review Tribunal and the  Refugee Review Tribunal (which constitute one body), and the Social  Security Appeals Tribunal. 

 - The back-office functions of seven Canberra-based cultural collection  institutions and archival institutions will be amalgamated to realise  synergies. These seven organisations have a similar focus and are  geographically sited in close proximity: the National Archives, the  National Film and Sound Archive, the National Gallery, the National  Library, the National Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and Old  Parliament House. 

 - Different functions of the Office of the Australian Information  Commissioner will be merged into the Australian Human Rights  Commission, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Commonwealth  Ombudsman and the Attorney-General’s Department. 

 - The Private Health Insurance Administration Council will have some  functions merged into the Australian Competition and Consumer  Commission and others into the Australian Prudential Regulation  Authority, while the Private Health Insurance Industry Ombudsman  merges into the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman.  

 - The AQUAPLAN Working Group will be merged into the Aquaculture  Committee. 

 - Several bodies will be merged into the National Biosecurity Committee:  the Australian Weeds Committee, Biosafety and Biosecurity Working  Group and Established Pests and Diseases Working Group. 

 - The National Competition Council Secretariat will merge into the  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. 

 

 6 

 - The National Blood Authority will merge with the Australian Organ and  Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority. 

 ï· In consultation with the State and Territories, the Government will also  consider opportunities for more streamlined and efficient arrangements to  drive much needed productivity and performance improvements in the health  care sector. The National Commission of Audit has highlighted that there is  scope to improve the way data is collected, analysed and disseminated by the  multitude of Australian Government bodies currently working in this field.  

 - Subject to consultation, a new health productivity and performance  commission will be formed by merging the following existing bodies with  related functions: the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in  Health Care, the Independent Hospitals Pricing Authority, the National  Health Funding Body, the National Health Funding Pool Administrator,  the National Health Performance Authority and the Australian Institute of  Health and Welfare.  

 - These bodies have related functions around improving the quality of  health care and raising awareness of particular health matters. By  operating as separate entities, opportunities are being lost for more  coordinated administration and the combined overheads are wasteful. 

 Preventing commencement of new agencies  

 The Abbott Government announced in the 2014-15 Budget that it will not proceed with  the establishment of two new bodies which the previous Government sought to  establish and fund in 2013.  

 ï· The Government will not proceed with the plans of the previous Government  to create a Student Identifiers Agency. Instead the Abbott Government will  achieve savings by appointing a statutory officeholder within the Department  of Industry to administer the same set of responsibilities.    

 ï· Likewise funding will be reclaimed by ceasing plans to establish a Brisbane  Cross River Rail and Melbourne Metro Projects Advisory Board. This will help  repair the Budget and fund policy priorities. 

 Assessing future ownership options 

 In the 2014-15 Budget, the Government has provided funding for scoping studies into  future ownership options for Defence Housing Australia, Australian Hearing, the  Royal Australian Mint and the registry function of the Australian Securities and  Investments Commission. 

 A scoping study will also consider more efficient options for the Defence Service  Homes Insurance Scheme. 

 7 

 Divestment of assets will also occur within agencies. A number of properties which are  surplus to the needs of agencies will be progressively sold over the next three years  and savings will be redirected to repair the Budget. 

 The Government will also achieve further efficiencies through implementing a  ‘Contestability Framework’ to assess whether particular government functions should  be open to competition and how competition should occur. This will allow competing  providers to come from both inside and outside government and help ensure that  government functions are undertaken in the most efficient manner by the organisation  most able to do so.   

 Under this new framework, over the next three years, government functions will be  systematically reviewed to determine if they are, in whole or in part, appropriate for  competition.  

 As a principle, government bodies should not be given preference as service delivery  agents, where others are more capable of providing the same service. The world has  changed greatly from the time when governments enjoyed an insurmountable  advantage in running sophisticated public services, owing to their access to  information, supporting capital and technology. Greater competition will result in  better value for money in the efficient delivery of functions and will help provide more  agile service delivery to the public. 

 Implementation work on phase one reforms 

 Several of the most significant initiatives announced in the first phase of agency  rationalisation have been subsequently included as measures in the 2014-15 Budget.  These budget measures will achieve: 

 ï· Savings from consolidating AusAID into DFAT, including from removing  duplication in corporate functions, introducing more efficient models for  administering Official Development Assistance and creating other efficiencies. 

 ï· Savings from consolidating the key parts of the Department of Regional  Australia, Local Government, the Arts and Sport into the Department of  Infrastructure and Regional Development. These savings will be achieved  through the removal of duplication in corporate functions. 

 ï· Proceeds from the sale of Medibank Private. 

 Timing for implementation of phase two initiatives 

 Most of the phase two initiatives announced in the 2014-15 Budget are to take effect by  1 July 2015. Some reforms may take longer where there are existing Federal-State  arrangements that require re-negotiation, or where more efficient replacement bodies  need to be established in legislation. 

 

 8 

 The forecast savings 

 The reforms in the 2014-15 Budget will deliver total savings of $530 million through to  2017-18. These ongoing savings are necessary so that the Government can repair the  Budget and strengthen Australia’s future. 

 In some cases where a service delivered by a government body has been funded via a  levy and that body is abolished or streamlined, savings from the more efficient new  arrangements will ultimately be enjoyed by those who pay the levy.  

 Some reforms will have transitional costs associated with IT system changes, staff  redundancies, or costs for winding up legacy contracts. However as reforms are  implemented, there will be substantial long-term benefits to taxpayers from permanent  structural reductions to government overheads.

 exclude the savings that will be achieved from: 

 1. Abolishing grants administered by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency which 

 total approximately $357.0 million in 2017-18 funding. 

 2. Savings for the Infrastructure Investment Programme administered by the Department 

 of Infrastructure and Regional Development of $113.5 million from 2013-14 onwards. 

 The savings included for the measure Strengthen and enhance Australia's border protection services 

 reflect the net impact on the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.

 While savings from rationalising some government bodies can be limited or difficult to  quantify because of mergers or consolidations, the savings were never the primary  reason for any of these reforms. Of equal importance the Smaller Government  initiatives create more coherent and effective government structures.  

 The importance of ongoing reform 

 The National Commission of Audit has recommended that a large number of public  bodies be subject to closer examination, with a view to making further reforms.  

 The Abbott Government will make decisions on further reforms by the end of 2014, to  ensure a thorough and wide-ranging approach to finding further opportunities to  rationalise bureaucratic structures. 

 The Smaller Government reform agenda is based upon methodical re-thinking of the  Commonwealth’s responsibilities from first principles.  

 In some cases this re-assessment points to a shedding of functions (winding up some  bodies, transferring functions to non-government or commercial providers, or return  of responsibilities to the states and territories) and in other cases requires more  efficient structures (through streamlining functions, consolidating bodies into  departments, or merging bodies). 

 Rationalising the number of Australian Government bodies will bring a number of  benefits including: 

 ï· Reducing the number of points of entry to government, so that it is easier  for the public to interact with government. 

 ï· Improving the effectiveness of government administration by simplifying  the coordination required for cross-agency work. 

 ï· Achieving savings through the reduction of overheads associated with  separate governance arrangements and the oversight costs of responsible  departments, central agencies and integrity agencies. 

 ï· Reducing the number of stand-alone bodies with narrow responsibilities  by merging bodies together or consolidating their roles into departments -  this gives government more capacity and flexibility to refocus resources on  emerging pressures and priorities. 

 ï· Increasing career options within the public sector and reducing the costs  associated with inter-agency transfers. 

 

 11 

 Implications for a smaller and more efficient Public Service  

 The number of government bodies tells only a part of the story of the cost and growth  of the public sector. Total public sector staff numbers also illustrate the growth of the  Australian Government. The number of employees in the General Government Sector  increased significantly over the past decade from around 217,000 in 2002-03 to around  257,000 in 2012-13.   

 The Smaller Government reforms are the Abbott Government’s solution for reducing  public sector staffing levels on a basis of deliberate decisions about functions, priorities  and the proper scope of Government. 

 It is anticipated that over the four years to 2016-17, the Australian Public Service will  reduce by 16,500 positions. Some 14,500 of these reductions are the result of the  previous Government’s decisions in the 2013-14 Budget, in the 2013 Economic  Statement and as a result of preceding decisions and policy settings. Around 2,000 are  the result of decisions taken in the 2014-15 Budget. 

 The Budget forecasts for the 2014-15 year will see total staffing in the General  Government Sector return to a level around that last recorded in 2007-08. Excluding  military personnel and reservists, staffing levels will return to a more efficient and  sustainable level around that last recorded in 2006-07. 

 The Abbott Government has adopted measures to better manage the 14,500 reduction  in staffing levels as a result of decisions taken by the previous Government in 2013.  Specifically, controls have been put in place to ensure any recruitment is well justified  and funding was provided to those agencies that are facing financial strain to cover  required redundancy payments and ensure that the day-to-day operations of those  agencies is not compromised. 

 Interim recruitment arrangements that the Government announced on 31 October 2013  are still continuing as a way of achieving the forecast reductions and ensuring that the  size of the public service is managed based on deliberate whole-of-government choices  about priorities. 

 As part of the Smaller Government agenda, the Government will continue to identify  additional areas where appropriate reductions can be achieved in the number of  government bodies and related staffing levels.

 POLICY FRAMEWORK 

 Getting the policy settings right for the long term  

 In response to recommendations of the National Commission of Audit, the Abbott  Government will continue to implement reforms that transition the public sector  towards leaner business-like ways of operating. 

 To support better decision-making in future about the shape and size of government, I  will release an Australian Government Governance Policy later in 2014. In developing  this, the Abbott Government will consider introducing a requirement for some form of  cost-benefit analysis for future proposals to create new government bodies. This will  help guard against a future loss of discipline over decisions on the size and shape of  government.  

 The policy will ensure fundamental efficiency and effectiveness considerations are  given proper attention. A number of policy principles recommended by the National  Commission of Audit will be considered for inclusion in the policy. Some of the most  significant principles that could be applied to both existing government bodies and  proposals to establish new bodies include: 

 ï· Whether a current or proposed body performs a public function properly  belonging to the Commonwealth; 

 ï· Whether a government body is necessary to provide the function; 

 ï· Whether functions can be grouped more efficiently into a small number of  government bodies;  

 ï· Whether government bodies have the appropriate type of legal structure to  achieve their purpose in the most efficient and effective manner. 

 Too often government bodies are established on a permanent basis, when the policy  problems they seek to address can be solved or moderated over the short to medium  term. In such cases, creation of a public body should be a policy choice of second  recourse, after consideration has been given to project-based solutions (like temporary  taskforces). Where public bodies are established in such circumstances, sunsetting  rules can be attached, to provide end dates or milestones for winding-up.  

 Better policy clarity in this area will prevent the proliferation of wasteful structures,  including by ensuring efficient alternatives are considered up front. 

 

 13 

 Better information on the shape and size of government 

 Demonstrating our commitment to open and accountable administration, the Abbott  Government will also put in place a publicly-searchable directory of government  bodies. This will for the first time put an official number on the total of Australian  Government bodies, support better management of government bodies, and will  provide the community more clarity on how to find the most appropriate part of  government to deal with. 

 As well as providing greater transparency, such a list will capture information that will  strengthen the future ability to continually and systemically review the nature and  scope of all public bodies. 

 

 

 14 

 THE PROBLEMS WITH OVER-GROWN GOVERNMENT 

 Losing count of government offshoots 

 Information on the organisation of government is not found in any one place. Relevant  sources include annual reports, the State of the Service Report; the Government Online  Directory, body-specific websites and the AusGovBoards website.   

 There are now so many different Commonwealth bodies that there is no authoritative  and definitive figure. Public service heads have, in recent years, not had a current and  reliable count of the number of government bodies. 

 The last attempt to catalogue a comprehensive list of all Australian Government  agencies was in 2009. Known as the List of Australian Bodies and Governance  Relationships, it took an entire year to research and catalogue every Australian  Government body.  

 ï· This last full list identified 932 bodies and governance relationships as at   1 October 2009. This included 292 departmental bodies, 47 Ministerial  Councils, 54 joint Commonwealth-State bodies, 136 advisory bodies, and 118  statutory authorities and statutory committees, to name just a few of the  categories of entities.     

 ï· The usefulness of the list was constrained by its manual collation, limited data  on the responsibilities of bodies and the static nature of the data produced.  No  routine or automated process has since been put in place to provide updates. 

 Beginning in late 2013, the National Commission of Audit surveyed all  Commonwealth department heads, who reported over 800 bodies within their  portfolios.  

 Further research by the Commission identified a further 100 bodies beyond those that  department heads were able to identify.  

 Further research by the Department of Finance in preparation for the 2014-15 Budget  found that at the time of the 2013 election, there were closer to 1,000 different  government bodies.  

 Chart 1 on the following page shows the breakdown of the number of bodies by policy  portfolio, based upon the research of the National Commission of Audit. This analysis  finds that the portfolios with the greatest number of bodies are Agriculture,  Infrastructure and Regional Development, Attorney-General, Health, Industry and the  Environment.

 Notes: Principal bodies are bodies connected, to varying degrees, with government policies, 

 purposes or services which are prescribed under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 

 1997 or subject to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. Secondary bodies are 

 committees, councils, boards, statutory office holders, consultative bodies and working groups 

 linked to the Australian Government. 

 

 The inefficiency of small agencies 

 

 The growth in the number of bureaucracies has been most noticeable among small  agencies, which by their nature tend to have inefficient overheads. In the last decade,  the number of Government bodies with less than 300 staff has increased by 36 per cent  (from 84 to 114).   

 Small agencies face the same governance and compliance arrangements as the larger  agencies. The fixed costs and reporting obligations, when added up across the number  of small agencies in the Commonwealth, represent a material overhead for  government operations. A Chief Executive Officer, a Chief Financial Officer and  associated support staff can easily cost half a million dollars per year, before adding  scalable costs like separate IT systems, human resource costs and public relations.

 These are avoidable costs for a Government that understands the need for using scarce  taxpayer dollars responsibly. 

 It can be counter-productive for small agencies to absorb the costs of a complete suite  of corporate overheads and infrastructure, even if their role might otherwise justify a  degree of independence. As the National Commission of Audit has noted, the need for  independent decision making does not alone justify the establishment of a stand-alone  operational body. It is possible for some executive officeholders to have distinctive  branding and quarantined powers, but to be supported within a department or parent  agency.  

 Where a separately branded body or officeholder is hosted in a government  department, this will allow them to focus more on their core business and will reduce  distractions arising from generic administrative responsibilities. 

 Accountability problems 

 It is difficult for Ministers or parliament to have oversight of, let alone give strategic  direction to, a very large number of bodies.  

 Some bodies have been established with well-defined roles, then broadened their  activities over time through ‘regulatory creep’. Others branch into new areas of focus  as a result of the ambitions of their internal leadership. However well-intentioned or  worthwhile, not all scope creep by government bodies is consistent with the changing  policy priorities of the Australian Government, or are affordable alongside other  pressures on the public purse. 

 It is a concern to the Government that, in the current difficult fiscal environment, some  bodies have escaped adequate scrutiny because of their relative obscurity within the  wider scheme of government.  Consolidation of bodies in areas of similar activity can  enhance proper systems of oversight and lines of accountability. 

 Boards and committees 

 Many advisory committees have been created to address a particular policy area or  issue. These committees are easy to establish but once in existence are rarely abolished  and their overall benefit is rarely reviewed or assessed. They tend to remain because  they foster close support from their own constituencies and have low visibility among  the broader public. 

 Every time a new board or committee is created, it brings costs to the taxpayer.  The  overheads include not only internal governance costs but also oversight costs for  responsible departments, central agencies and integrity or oversight agencies.  Parent  departments often need dedicated resources just to manage the Government’s  relationship with boards and committees, including checking compliance with  government policies and coordination of cross-agency work. 

 17 

 The Howard Government sought to introduce a clean framework to guard against  inconsistent or poor practices in designing the governance arrangements for statutory  authorities and office holders. The policy principles it adopted were based on the  recommendations of the Review of Corporate Governance of Statutory Authorities and  Officeholders, known after its author as the ’Uhrig Review‘. Amongst other things, the  Uhrig Review principles put clarity around the circumstances where it was  appropriate to establish separate statutory authorities or boards. 

 In 2005 the Secretary of the Department of Finance issued a guidance document called  Governance Arrangements for Australian Government Bodies, drawing upon the thinking  of the Uhrig review. However this has lacked government policy authority, and has  not been enforceable.  

 Although the Uhrig recommendations were almost all formally agreed by the Howard  Government, in practice they have not been consistently used to shape the structure of  public bodies, particularly under the subsequent Government.   

 The lack of policy clarity and rigour around the establishment of new government  bodies has allowed new structures to proliferate, without regard to efficient  alternatives.  

 The Abbott Government will clarify, formalise and strengthen the policy framework.   Strong disciplines will be set in place to rebalance the size and shape of government. 

 Misuse of separate bodies for public relations purposes 

 The previous Government lacked a clear direction about when a self-contained,  separate agency  is appropriate and on the most efficient way to structure the  operations of government bodies. Short-term political factors have been behind some  decisions to create separate entities to give visibility to key issues or public demands,  even when more bureaucracy was not the most efficient way to achieve the desired  policy goal.  

 Several bodies created by the former government were intended to maintain a profile  in the news media and perform a public reassurance role, but lacked meaningful  powers fit for their purported purpose. 

 Examples of this “window dressing” approach include the following. 

 ï· In 2013 the previous Government created the Asbestos Safety and Eradication  Agency, consisting of fewer than 20 people. This function was already being  carried out as a separately-branded office within the then Department of  Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. However, the Minister  responsible wanted to raise the profile of government activities in this area, so  the decision was taken to create an entirely new, self-contained agency with all  the extra resource and administrative costs, previously paid by the 

 

 18 

 department. There was no change in the scope of the particular activity of  government, other than the addition of these overhead costs. 

 ï· The Australian National Preventive Health Agency was a new bureaucracy,  populated with positions that already existed in the Health Department. The  agency came under particular criticism for undertaking a costly study of a  possible ‘fat tax’, even though there was no support for such a policy from  either side of politics.  

 ï· Labor also created a $330,000 a year position of Petrol Commissioner. After  establishing the role in 2008, the Government then abandoned the failed  ‘FuelWatch’ policy that was linked to the position. In July 2013 when the then  Commissioner announced he would not seek reappointment, the Government  scrapped the dedicated post, assigning responsibility to the ACCC Chairman.  Chairman Rod Sims was scathing of the decision to fund a special petrol  pricing commissioner, saying: 

 “I believe it was an unsuccessful policy. [...] We had no extra powers;  we just had somebody playing an extra monitoring role, really. It, I  think, gave the public a wrong understanding about the ACCC's role  and what we could do. […] My concern was: having a Petrol  Commissioner elevated expectations of what the ACCC could and  could not do beyond what was possible.”1 

 Other case studies of over-complex government structures 

 Appointment committees are an example of over-engineered and wasteful types of  government structures, that were identified as a concern by the National Commission  of Audit.   

 For example there is a seven person Grape and Wine Research and Development  Corporation Selection Committee, that was tasked with advising the Minister on  appointments to the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation. There  is also a separate Wine Australia Corporation Selection Committee for the Wine  Australian Corporation, which selects candidates from the same industry.  

 Both committees will be abolished by the Abbott Government, while the parent bodies  will be merged. Advice on appointments will be sourced in future from the  department, consulting within industry as appropriate. 

 Some government bodies are grouped into overly complex arrangements that include  sub-committees, working groups and other governance bodies reporting to each other.  

 

 1 Hansard, Senate Economics Committee, 20 November 2013, p.54.

 For example in the field of biosecurity, there is an Emergency Preparedness Working  Group that reports through an Emergency Preparedness and Response Working  Group, which in turn reports to a National Biosecurity Committee. In addition there is  a Biosafety and Biosecurity Working Group (responsible for setting standards for  laboratories, additional to other Commonwealth laboratory regulators) and an  Established Pests Working Group. On top of all this, there is an Incident  Communication Network, and a Biosecurity Stakeholder Consultative Group, plus a  Biosecurity Information Governance Group. 

 However worthy the functions of these various inter-connected bodies, these  structures are hardly streamlined and efficient. 

 Sometimes wasteful structures are put in place to give a tailored solution to a  particular industry, even though there may be another Australian Government body  well suited to the same role on an industry-neutral basis. For instance the Private  Health Insurance Administration Council undertakes monitoring of competition and  prudential regulation, which are roles performed by the Australian Competition and  Consumer Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority  respectively. 

 Some government bodies share different responsibilities in regulating a single business  process. Others have a single client relationship with another government body (for  instance ComSuper and the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation have closely  intertwined operations). Such arrangements could be greatly simplified by bringing  these connected organisations under a single structure, to cut the overheads imposed  on taxpayers.

 SUMMARY 

 Changing the way the Australian Government does business 

 Today taxpayers are saddled with the costs of a large number of government  departments, agencies, committees, boards and other bodies. Some have overlapping  responsibilities, which can result in blurred accountability and uncoordinated action.  This can be confusing and costly for the community.  People and businesses sometimes  struggle to identify which agencies to engage with and there can be a poor customer  experience when government disperses related issues across institutional boundaries -  leaving people to navigate between the cracks. 

 Consolidation of bodies has occurred in a number of other sectors of the economy over  past decades including among institutions such as superannuation funds, trade unions  and life insurers. Although different Australian Governments have sometimes shown  the mettle to undertake major policy reforms to the design of legislation or of  government services, none has made major inroads into reducing the number of  government bodies. 

 The National Commission of Audit starkly illustrated the expansion in the complexity  of the Australian Government by showing the growth in the Administrative  Arrangements Order at different points in time over the decades. The complexity of  government has become worse over time as new functions have been added.   

 As the Australian Government now faces an outlook of fiscal deficits and constraints  stretching over the coming decade, more discipline is needed on several fronts. Our  structures of government are well overdue for reform and a clean up will contribute to  both fiscal repair and a better focus on the delivery of outcomes. 

 The Abbott Government will continue to pursue opportunities for a smaller and more  rational government footprint because: 

 ï· What we do we should do well and with a clear public purpose; 

 ï· A lack of discipline on the shape and size of Australian Government is no  longer sustainable; and 

 ï· Australians deserve a government that serves its interests by living within its  means and taking the hard decisions to repair the budget bottom line. 

 The Smaller Government reforms made today will strengthen Australia and prepare  our country for the long term challenges before us.

 # Principal bodies are bodies connected, to varying degrees, with government policies, purposes or services which are prescribed under the Financial Management and 

 Accountability Act 1997 or subject to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. Secondary bodies are committees, councils, boards, statutory office holders, 

 consultative bodies and working groups linked to the Australian Government. 

 Notes: 

 ^ These figures exclude savings such as those from reduced grant, loan and other programme expenses which are not directly related to operational 

 overheads and therefore are not directly attributable to more efficient government structures. The figures in Tables 2 and 3 therefore exclude the 

 savings that will be achieved from Abolishing grants administered by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency which total approximately $357.0 

 million in 2017-18 funding. 

 ~ These bodies are part of the measure Smaller Government - additional reductions in the number of Australian Government bodies, which provides 

 savings of $19.4 million over five years.
