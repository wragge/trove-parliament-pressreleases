 “The Asia Pacific Region in the 1990‘s: The Changing Security and Economic Challenges"

 I an delighted to be able to address you today on what  I believe will be the major influences on the economic  and security outlook for the Asia-Pacific region in the  1990T s :

 - and I am grateful to the Singapore Australia Business Council and the Foreign Correspondents  Association for providing such an excellent forum.

 As Leader of the Federal Opposition in Australia, I  want the clear objective of our policies to be making  Australia a major economic and political force in the  Asia-Pacific region by the year 2000;

 - we will be providing policies across the board (in  economic management, defence, immigration,  diplomacy etc) which promote that objective.

 The challenge involved in that task is to anticipate  the forces of change in the Asia-Pacific region and to  manage them productively.

 It is those forces to change that I want to identify  and analyse today.

 The past year has not been a vintage one for analysts of international affairs;

 - who among them anticipated the historic changes we  have witnessed, particularly in Europe?

 - who predicted that in the space of twelve months v  we would see the Communist Party's leading role in  the Soviet Union ended,  the Berlin Wall torn down,  democratic revolutions sweeping Eastern Europe,  

 and Germany standing on the verge of unification?

 - in our own region, who predicted, for example,  the  rapprochement between the Soviet Union and the  Republic of Korea?

 2

 who foresaw the course of events in China during  and after Tiananmen Square?

 who assessed accurately the widening role of Japan  on regional dispute resolution (Eg. on Cambodia)?

 These and other changes are ushering in a new era in  international affairs:

 - what was known as "the post-war period" has now  ended, as has the phenomenon which dominated it,  namely the Cold War.

 The dimensions of the new international era we are entering are clear:

 - economic objectives and economic interdependence  among countries are driving the foreign policies  of nations to a greater degree than they have  previously;

 y

 - ideological differences, which fuelled the  animosities of the Cold War, are breaking down;

 - security alliances are becoming less exclusively  military and more broadly based.

 None of this is to say that security issues and the use  of force in international affairs have somehow become  obsolete:

 - they obviously have not;

 - the new era we are entering may well be one in 

 which the prospect of conflict between the major  powers is reduced but in which the security  prospects for specific regions are less certain  and predictable:

 - it should not be forgotten that a central reason  why the Cold War has ended in the way it has was  because the Western allies and other nations were  prepared to co-operate on a defence strategy that 

 successfully deterred Soviet and other communist  military adventurism;

 3

 tout what is happening in the 19901s is that  nations are becoming more preoccupied with  economic rather than military competition* This  phenomenon is breaking down old barriers and  building new bridges;

 :  for a dramatic illustration of this fact one need look no further than the outcome of the  NATO Summit in London a few days ago when  many of the assumptions that have underpinned  Western strategy for a generation were 

 revised.

 I want to talk today on what this rapid pace of  international economic and strategic change means for  the countries of the Asia—Pacific region:

 — I want to do so at two levels:  in terms of

 economic opportunities and challenges and in terms  of the regional security outlook.

 ECONOMIC CHANGE

 . In economic terms,  global interdependence is becoming  more and more real: .

 - trade and investment flows are becoming truly  internati ona Used.

 But the great paradox of the current situation is that  at the very time w h e m  thic interaatioaalisat2on i  gathering real momentum, with benefits for producers  and consumers alike, a great threat to it is emerging 

 in the form of trade protectionism and the resort to  "managed” rather than "free” trade.

 While tariff barriers have been lowered in many  countries, non-tariff barriers to trade flows remain  considerable.

 Furthermore, economic regionalism can be either  supportive of an open international trade system, or an  obstacle to it:

 4

 that is why the "Europe 1992" project and recent  talk of a free trade area in the Americas, while  potentially such constructive initiatives, create  fears in some quarters than they could operate at  some future time in an exclusive way that would  spell the end of the open international trade 

 system we have known under the GATT.

 The current Uruguay Round of global trade negotiations  are, therefore, vital:

 - securing a successful outcome of these  negotiations by December is the most important  item on the global economic agenda in 1990.

 - they are especially vital for the countries of the  Asia-Pacific region whose economic dynamism and  rapid growth have been built on competitive  infrastructures and access to foreign markets.

 What is at stake in the multilateral negotiations of  the Uruguay Round is not just the future of GATT but  the potential benefits that can be gained from trade  liberalisation:

 - a recent study sponsored by the Confederation of  Asia-Pacific Chambers of Commerce and Industry  (CACCI) concluded that, if North America and the  EC halved their tariff and non-tariff barriers,  world income would be boosted by almost US$400  billion. It also concluded that, if the Asia-  Pacific region embarked on a similar course of 

 action, the world economy would increase by  approximately US$700 billion.

 Without a successful outcome of the Uruguay Round in  reducing both tariff and non-tariff barriers, these  potential gains are likely to be lost and the resort to  "managed trade" will be encouraged at great cost to the  most efficient producers.

 The countries of our region, and Japan in particular,  have a vital contribution to make in breaking the  current logjam in the Uruguay Round:

 - the G7 meeting in Houston over the next few days 

 should commit itself to making the compromises  required for such success, and Japan should urge  such a commitment on its G7 partners;

 5

 Japan can also give a lead by reviewing its own  policies on “food security" and liberalising its  rice imports.

 At a regional level, initiatives such as APEC must  create an "open regionalism" consistent with GATT  principles.

 The Liberal Party which I lead has consistently  promoted more effective economic regionalism (Eg. the  1980 PECC initiative by Malcolm Fraser and Japanese  Prime Minister Ohira);

 — but we have always done so on the basis that such 

 regionalism must have clear goals by which its  effectiveness can be measured, that it must be  complemented by effective restructuring wiihin  domestic economies, and that it must support an  open international trade system.

 REGIONAL SECURITY OUTLOOK

 . In Europe, the pace of strategic change is almost  bewildering:

 - we now even have the prospect of Mr Gorbachev 

 attending the next NATO summit!

 Sut the pace of strategic change beyond Europe is different:

 - against the trend in Europe and the US, military  budgets in the Middle East and parts of Asia are  expanding dangerously;

 - the levels of Soviet military forces in the North  Asian area may have reduced in quantity but not,   to date, in effectiveness or strike power;

 - similarly, the United States is making some  quantitative reductions in its forces in the  Pacific but it has clearly indicated that it will  be retaining a significant regional security  presence.

 Nevertheless,  the forces of change in the security  outlook of the Asia-Pacific region are gathering  momentum and posing some vital questions which will  dominate the regional security outlook in the 1990Ts:

 6

 in â Tppsn ,  fhevr#=> is -much spec” 1s t i n n  a b o u t   relations with the Soviet Union and the prospect  of the visits to Japan by Foreign Minister  Shevardnadze later this year and President  Gorbachev early next year:

 there is an expectation that Mr Gorbachev  will make an offer to resolve the issue of  the Northern Territories;

 :  what the Japanese and Soviet price for rapprochement will be and what its  consequences will entail are central  questions, as yet unanswered;

 : but what Is clear is that there is potential for a change in relations that will vitally  tiffed. Ihe regional security outlook as well  as Japan—US relations generally;

 on the Korean peninsula, the possibility of  unification seems less distant than a few months  ago;

 the Roh/Gorbachev meeting in San Francisco in  June has broadened South Korea's economic  horizons;

 it has also further isolated North Korea  putting more pressure on it to negotiate with  the South (Eg. the meeting of Korean Prime  Ministers this week and the partial opening 

 of the border);

 in the Philippines, the real question seems not  if, but when and how, the military operations  currently conducted from the US bases there will  be terminated;

 :  the Philippines seem intent in the current negotiations with the US to set a firm  timetable for US withdrawal, not US phase  down;

 :  but it is also true that most regional

 countries favour a continuing US security  presence and the question is where and how  that presence will be based after the  Philippines bases are closed;

 7

 in Cambodia, the conflict goes on:

 :  countries such as Japan, Australia and those of ASEAN can and have assisted in promoting a  settlement, but the real key is to China;

 :  the vital question is whether the Khmer Rouge still favour a military solution and whether  the current conflicting reports about their  military strength and successes mean that the 

 current phase of the peace process is  stalled;

 : China can influence the Khmer Rouge to accept a settlement in a way no other country can  (Eg. ending its arms supply);

 : the TJN Permanent Five meeting this week in Paris will hopefully see some “carrot and  stick" approach in encouraging a constructive  role by China in Cambodia;

 the issue of China’s role in the region is  changing rapidly:

 : Indonesia and China have recently thawed their frozen diplomatic relationship:

 :  Thailand is clearly keen to pursue extensive economic contacts with China-,

 :  Japan is currently putting the case at the G7 meeting in Houston for easing international  trade and financial restrictions on China.

 How China is rehabilitated into the internetional  community, and who leads that process, will have  vital implications for our region’s security  outlook;

 the flow of refugees in our region also has the  potential to raise regional security tensions-.

 : the Comprehensive Plan of Action by regional countries to deal with boat people from  Vietnam must be preserved;

 : all parties must respect their ,

 responsibilities, especially in terms of both  providing first asylum and the repatriation  of non-refugees; '

 8

 the "United States has a special and urgent  responsibility to resolve the dilemma which  its opposition to the repatriation of non­ refugees has created for the Comprehensive  Plan of Action;

 we are now at a crunch point - first asylum  countries are almost at the end of their  tolerance on this issue;

 if the CPA is to survive - as it must - the 

 United States must provide a lead in breading  the current impasse and first asylum  countries must respond constructively;

 It seems to me that a clear linkage is now emerging on  the issues of resolving the Cambodian conflict,  rehabilitating China and settling the tragic refugee  dilemma:

 - the refugee issue can only ultimately be settled  if the Cambodian conflict is resolved and if  economic conditions in Vietnam improve;

 - foreign aid to Vietnam will only be restored fully  when a Cambodian peace settlement is agreed;

 - China has a crucial role to play but must be 

 pressured effectively with real incentives and  penalties involved;

 - US involvement is essential but the rewards for  the risks it needs to take must be apparent.

 In all these areas, the scope for leverage at the present time is great:

 — China is seeking ways to restore access to trade  credits and technology;

 — the Khmer Rouge are dependent on China’s military  supplies;

 — Vietnam is in dire need of economic assistance ’· "  which could be linked to a return of refugees;

 — the US and other Western countries are central to  facilitating the aid necessary in Indo-china to  underwrite a settlement;

 — the UK has indicated it is willing to be involved .  

 in overseeing a settlement.

 9 i

 Perhaps a package arrangement, clearly establishing the  linkages I have outlined, is the best way forward:

 without this "big picture" approach the danger is  that individual nations will seek to do separate  bilateral deals with China and Vietnam;

 this is already starting to happen and would be  counter-productive to long-term regional  stability.

 In meeting these emerging security challenges in our  region, Australia's priorities are clear:

 as an ally of the United States under the ANZUS  Treaty, Australia should encourage the retention  of an effective US security presence in the  Western Pacific:

 :  an American retreat could lead to a new and unpredictable regional contest for power and  .  influence;

 as an independent sovereign nation, we have a  responsibility for maintaining an independent  self-defence capability and for effective defence  co-operation with allies and regional friends;

 as a country of the Asia—Pacific region, we have a  shared interest with other regional countries in  regular consultations on security issues as well  as programs for practical co-operation:

 in that context, the Five Power Defence  Arrangements (involving Australia, the UK, New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia) as well  as Australia's bilateral defence co-operation  with other ASEAN countries are constructive 

 and important undertakings.

 10

 CONCLUSION

 Let ne briefly summarise the themes I wish to emphasise  today:

 first,  economic and security interests are more  inter-related today than they have ever been;

 second, the basis of economic growth, as the  countries of the Asia-Pacific region have shown,  is competitive internal structures and effective  access to foreign markets:

 :  the current Uruguay Round is the most serious test to date of whether the open  international trading order whiCh we have  known since the late 1940‘s will survive over  the longer term;

 third, the security outlook for the Asia-Pacific  region is on the verge of possible changes (in the  Philippines, Korea, Japan and elsewhere) which  could be as dramatic as anything we have witnessed  1  r e c e n t ly in Europe and with consequences that ore 

 difficult to anticipate: -

 :  in these circumstances, the retention of an effective US security presence and closer  security co-operation between regional  countries.are essential.
