 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well, how exciting and inspiring is this. Advanced manufacturing in Australia, exporting, best in the  world, technology, collaboration with Deakin University, Geelong - centre of carbon fibre  innovation globally. Australians can do anything. Taking advantage of our big trade export deals.  Taking advantage of our commitment to innovation and science. Here you have the revival of  Australian manufacturing. If you believe some people they would say it’s all over but the truth is  Australians can do anything but you need a clear economic plan to do it. That’s the choice at this 

 election. We have that plan. We have that clear economic plan, a national economic plan.  Innovation, investment, trade export deals, opening up those big markets, backing businesses like  this with tax reductions. Right across the board we are supporting businesses like this and we’re  supporting innovation and I’m so proud to be here in Geelong with Sarah Henderson. So proud  because she is such a great advocate of her community which has been doing it tough with this  transition, this economic transition, but you can see the success of it, you can see with investment,  with innovation, you can see the big opportunities that are here for Geelong and of course we see  them all over Australia.   

 Can I say that the clear choice is one between my government - a stable Coalition Government with  that national economic plan - and on the other hand the chaos of Labor-Greens-independents. We  heard Richard Di Natale this morning warming up to submit his log of claims on Mr Shorten over his  demands for weaker policies on border protection, no doubt higher taxes on business. Who knows  what would emerge from the chaos of an alliance like that.   

 That’s why between now and July the 2nd every vote counts, every single vote counts. The only way  to ensure the economic security, to ensure the prosperity of Australia is to vote for the Coalition.  Vote for Liberal and National candidates because we have a plan.   

 Labor has a list of complaints. It has lies. It has personal attacks. It has no plan for jobs and growth.   

 And you know there are many other choices too here, or many other clear cut differences. Mr  Shorten has said that he has the same border protection policy as the Government. That is simply  untrue. It is untrue. There are three pillars on which our border protection policy is based and this is 

 what they are - turning boats back, Temporary Protection Visas and offshore processing. Labor has  already said that they will abandon, abolish Temporary Protection Visas. That will be used as a  marketing ploy, as a marketing plan by the people smugglers. They will say: “If you get to Australia  and there’s a Labor government, don’t worry, you will be able to stay permanently.” They will use  that - that is a golden opportunity for them to be marketing and we see evidence of that marketing  already. And of course in terms of turn backs, the question is, does Labor have the will to do it? Their  policy says that they retain the option of turning boats back. The real question is - do they have the  will? We saw what happened under Kevin Rudd, he said he’d do it but then he did not - 50,000  unauthorised arrivals, 1200 deaths at sea of which we know and we know that Mr Shorten has at  least fifty of his colleagues and candidates who are vehemently opposed to our policy on border  protection. So the truth is, Labor does not have the same policy as the Coalition on border   protection because of the three pillars, they avowedly have abandoned one of them and we cannot  trust them on the others - based on their past experience in government and recognising the  opposition of so many of his colleagues with the fundamental elements of keeping our borders  secure.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Prime Minister on corporate tax cuts, you said you want to get them all through in the next term of  Parliament but that could be difficult. Will you potentially split them up to guarantee that the small  businesses will get their tax cuts even if the bigger businesses don't get the tax cuts?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well you’re asking me a hypothetical question. We don’t even know who will be in the Senate at this  stage let alone the House of Representatives.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Prime Minister we’re about to see a vote in the UK on Brexit. Can I just ask you if there was a vote to  leave, do you think that would represent the first significant unravelling of the European  experiment? What would the strategic consequences be? Would it assist Britain? Russia? And what  would you do?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 It would be a very big shock there is no doubt about that if Britain votes to leave the European  Union. There will be obviously be great efforts to ensure that the consequences of that shock are  minimised. Clearly Britain is not voting to leave NATO for example so the strategic implications are  not as severe as they could be if that were the case. But it will be a big shock and it is a reminder, as  Margaret Thatcher once said, to expect the unexpected. There are a lot of headwinds in the global  economy. There are a lot of challenges. There are a lot of things that are beyond our control that  affect global markets that affect us. That is why you need to have a stable government with a clear  national economic plan that builds on and builds up the resilience of our economy. That is why the  economy is front and centre of everything we are talking about. It is absolutely critical to have that  strong economy and to have a resilient 21st century economy, in order not only that you can take  advantage of the great opportunities that are there, but so that you can deal with the challenges  that arise in the global environment.   

 JOURNALIST: 

 Tony Abbott has said overnight that he is ready to serve and essentially his future is in your hands.  I’ve heard you many times this campaign say the Ministry you have now will be the Ministry you  have after the election but is he any chance of coming back to the frontbench while you’re Prime  Minister?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Mark, I can only say what I have said before that I have a very capable Ministry. It is a younger  Ministry, it is a relatively new ministry, in many respects and the Ministry that I will lead after the  election, if we win, will be the same as I lead today.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 Labor's candidate for Cowan, Anne Aly is regarded as an expert for stopping Islamic youth from  joining terror groups and has received federal funding including from the Coalition in the past for her  work. Yet your Justice Minister Michael Keenan yesterday effectively accused her of being soft on  terrorism because she had written a letter suggesting Junaid Thorne and another young person  would be candidates for her de-radicalisation program and counselling during sentencing  submissions after they were charged with flying under a false name. She says she is now on a kill list  from Muslim radicals. Isn’t Mr Keenan’s comments just a smear because the Liberal Party is  struggling to hold Cowan?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 I can't comment on reports that I haven't seen and with respect I don't know whether what you’re  reporting is accurate so I just can’t comment on that.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 We’re hearing from both camps that this scare campaign of Labor’s is starting to bite. How  frustrating is that you haven’t been able to counter it to date and do you have any more shots in the  box to try and overcome this before election day?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Well it is a deceitful scare, it is a deceitful lie. It is a lie. Indeed the President of the AMA himself has  said what Labor is saying about Medicare is false. So I won’t dignify it with anything other than to say  it is a desperate lie and one that I believe Australians will recognise for what it is - a dishonest act of  desperation.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 How much do you think the CFA issue will help you retain the seat of Corangamite?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Look the CFA have been outrageously treated by this Labor government here in Victoria. The idea  that you would subject 60,000 volunteers, disrespect their service, disrespect their selflessness and  their courage in defence of their own communities and put them under the thumb of a militant  union - that tells you a lot about the Labor Party. It tells you a lot about Bill Shorten. Remember he  said he wanted to run Australia like a trade union. Well if he became Prime Minister he would run 

 Australia at the direction of militant trade unions. Not just the UFU, the CFMEU. We saw what he did  on the instruction of the Transport Workers Union. That put 35,000 family businesses, owner-driver  truck owners out of business. If we had not been able by the skin of our teeth to abolish that  tribunal they would be penniless. They wouldn’t be able to pay their mortgages. They wouldn’t be  able to pay the grocery bill. This is what Labor did. They are totally, wholly-owned subsidiaries of  militant unions. Nobody can believe that Daniel Andrews is taking on the CFA. It seems political  madness but he has no choice - he is owned by those unions and so is Bill Shorten. His silence speaks  volumes. We stand up for those volunteers and as I said earlier today if we are returned to  Government we will amend the Fair Work Act to protect it from this shocking union take-over.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 As a moderate member of the Liberal Party throughout your career how personally do you feel  about having to resort to a scare campaign on asylum seekers?   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 What I have described is the facts. They may be uncomfortable. They may be uncomfortable to you  for example. The fact is Bill Shorten says he has the same border protection policy as the Coalition.  He does not. He does not. He does not support Temporary Protection Visas.   

 Now look I’ve seen this film before and so have you. We’ve seen it before. Kevin Rudd did the same  thing. I was Opposition Leader at the time - I remember it well. Kevin Rudd said, “Oh yes we can  change John Howard’s border protection policy and don’t worry nothing will happen. Domestic  policy isn’t important. It’s only the push factors that matter.” We saw what happened. We saw Kevin  Rudd abandon the commitments he made prior to the election in 2007. He changed John Howard’s  policy. John Howard’s strong border protection policy which had worked and we got 50,000  unauthorised arrivals and 1,200 deaths at sea of which we know. These people smugglers are more  aggressive than ever. They have agents in Australia. They have access to technologies and  smartphones and social media that were not available in John Howard’s day. They are very adept  marketers. Let’s not kid ourselves. They are among the most evil criminals in the world but they are  very smart in the way they use social media and they market and they will market the change, a  Labor change to Temporary Protection Visas as an enormous opportunity. There will be more boats  and more people smuggling. There is no question about that. They test us out. We have turned back  28 boats and they know what our policy is. They absolutely know. So they test us. What do you think  they’ll do to Labor when they know that they have a government whose previous track-record was  one of weakness and has actually, factually, unequivocally abandoned one of the three pillars of our  policy? There is no question about that. So reporting that Bill Shorten has the same border  protection policy as the Coalition is not true. He does not. He does not. He cannot be trusted on the  border. What he is offering is an enormous marketing opportunity to the people smugglers. I know  some people find this hard to hear but it is true. These people smugglers are criminals. They are evil 

 criminals but they are very smart at marketing and any change, any weakness, they will exploit to  get more people, vulnerable people on boats and set off on voyages towards Australia.   

 JOURNALIST:   

 [Inaudible]   

 PRIME MINISTER:   

 Among seven people captured, kidnapped I should say, in an attack on an Australian contractor’s  operations in Nigeria. One person was killed in the attack. The Australia High Commissioner is on the 

 scene and we are working with the authorities, local authorities at the highest levels. We don’t know  at this stage the identity of the kidnappers and the families in Australia have been notified of course  but what I would say is I encourage you to be restrained in your reporting - in many respects the less  Julie and I say about this the better from the point of view of recovering the kidnapped people.  Okay? But it is a very serious kidnapping, a very serious criminal assault. One person was killed as  you know and the seven people have been kidnapped.   

 Thank you very much.
