 Kim Beazley - Doorstop Interview Subjects: Child Care, Ansett, Refugees

 Transcript - Salisbury, Queensland - 11 September 2001

 E & OE PROOF ONLY

 BEAZLEY: The reason we're here, and I do thank the Salisbury Community Child Care Centre here, the reason we're here is to demonstrate, to highlight work and family issues. The child care sector is critical. Development of youngsters in early age years is the coming education issue in our society now. What happens to kids between three and seven, we all understand now, basically determines what happens to them through their lives. There's enormous pressure on families now.

 That raises another issue, of course, and that is what happens when you've got both parents working and how the kids are properly looked after. Of course, there is a phase of child care that goes beyond what we're dealing with here, and that's after school hours care. After school hours care is one of the biggest problems now confronting parents and the pressures on them. The industrial relations system is not worker friendly. It's not family friendly. The flexibility was supposed to make it family friendly - and it has not.

 We've got these issues. We've got issues of proper resourcing for early childhood education. We've got issues of proper resourcing for child care. We've got issues of proper resourcing for after school hours care. And we have the issue of how we make work compatible with family life.

 The Industrial Relations Commission needs the capacity to do that. It needs it with awards. It needs it in terms of inquiring into what's happening with the casualisation of the Australian workforce, and looking at what is happening to working families in the industrial environment we now have. The signals sent by the system are so important in determining outcomes for ordinary Australians. The signals of this Government into the system is flexibility, not for families, but flexibility for employers only. We have to turn that around.

 These are the issues, one of the issues that we're going to be running on in this election campaign. It's all around pressures on family life. When we listen to the community, and we hear from them the things they want us to concentrate on, that is central.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, Ansett - decisions are being made on its future today. Should the Government have approved the deal with Singapore Airlines in the first place?

 BEAZLEY: The Government should have got to work. They've been on autopilot. They were presented with the position clearly in detail. They should have engaged to get the financial underpinnings of what was being presented to them. Governments have the public servants, they have the capacity, they have the trust to be able to get a clear-cut impression of what is happening when someone wants to engage them. Of course, the reason the Government was being engaged was to do something with the New Zealanders. They've sat on their hands for six months and a great national institution has collapsed. The Government has to bear some responsibility for that. We have here a massive job problem emerging. Full-time jobs in our community overall, and, of course, the full-time jobs of 16,000 Ansett workers. We have also emerging the problems of their workers' entitlements - what is their situation? None of us seems to know. Jobs are an emerging issue in the election campaign. But the real problem for Government right now is to provide whatever legislative fix that can be provided to ensure the maximum number of jobs are saved.

 JOURNALIST: The ACTU says that the Singapore deal would have been the best option…solution…few months ago. Do you agree?

 BEAZLEY: I think that is so glaringly obvious now. But it should have been glaringly obvious to the Government in the know at the time. This has not been a secret. What's been happening has not been a secret. Ansett has been briefing everybody on it. But, of course, they've only briefed the Government in detail because they want a result from the Government - and they've not got it.

 JOURNALIST: The Government is now suggesting a possible….would you go along with that solution?

 BEAZLEY: I go along with a solution that deals with two things in the first instance: jobs and regional services. We've got to assign priority to those issues over competition now. Ultimately, this is going to end up an issue about competition. But right now competition policy should be put on hold and what the Government ought to be doing is looking in the first instance to what deals with regional problems -which are going to be massive, absolutely massive. And what deals with workers' problems - which are going to be massive for those individual workers. And, of course, with the suppliers of Ansett. It's all up 60,000 jobs - in all or in part. This is a major employment issue. In the end, weeks from now, it's going to end up a competition issue. But that should be left for the long-term. In the meantime, everything that is necessary to keep services provided and jobs on the go ought to be done.

 JOURNALIST: Do you think that this Qantas/Virgin Blue…is a goer?

 BEAZLEY: Personally - and it's a difficult decision for the Qantas board - I would like to see the airline that is prepared to take on the bulk of Ansett's operations and staff being the airline which succeeds. And, if there is an impediment to that, legislatively or in the attitude of the ACCC, it should be removed. This is a bad circumstance. It would have been better six months ago if Singapore had picked it up. But that's a Government failure and water under the bridge. What's right now? What is right now is to try and keep the operation intact if that is at all possible. If there's a legislative impediment, we're for removing it.

 JOURNALIST: It seems inevitable, though…job losses.

 BEAZLEY: Job losses in these circumstances look highly likely. What you want to do is two things: minimise them and, secondly, make sure that those that go have their workers' entitlements intact. If the Labor Party had been in office, that would have been a certainty. That there's a question mark over it at all has been because of the Liberals' negligence on that over the last two years. But you've got to stop as many job losses as you can.

 For me, it's shattering. I have frequently travelled Ansett. I tried to keep a balance between Ansett and Qantas. All my life, as West Australian, I've been travelling by air - there's no other way to do it if you actually happen to be a West Australian. I think of all the staff from Ansett, those marvellous, cheerful people who have served me so well for so long, and the thought that they should be under threat now is the most horrifying thing I can imagine. In the end, all these other questions boil down to that simple human dimension. They don't deserve this. They've done nothing to produce this situation. And they deserve all our help and compassion now.

 JOURNALIST: …union element to this. Do you think that putting competition policy aside in order to save jobs may be a dangerous thing?

 BEAZLEY: Let's worry about competition in another three or four months, shall we? Let's just get this fixed. In the end, that will be a substantial problem for governments and a substantial problem for the country. But that is the long-term. What you have is an immediate problem. I've been talking just then about the staff. Let me tell you, about half of Australia is served regionally by Ansett operations -possibly a bit more, in fact. An awful lot of that is served uniquely by Ansett. In other words, there's no-one else in there. You're talking about some very distant centres now which are very directly threatened. I think of it in my own home State. Ansett, or Ansett subsidiaries, are absolutely critical providers there. And we're not talking about distance of 50 or 60 miles - we're talking about distances of thousands. I know it's the same in NSW and quite conceivably the same here, too. These are folk for whom the air services are a lifeline - an absolute lifeline. And this is now collapsing. It will not be easy to get somebody else to move into that place because there's almost invariably in these operations an element of cross-subsidisation. That's going to be a problem.

 JOURNALIST:Queensland has already experienced that problem losing Flight West. Are you saying there might be areas without….

 BEAZLEY: Right around Australia that's a question mark now. That's why we've got to get the regional services fixed. That's why we've got to get the jobs fixed. That's why these are much more important than competition.

 JOURNALIST: So what more could the Government…

 BEAZLEY: The Government should have approved Singapore Airlines. That's quite evident. And if you'd been sitting down there in the know and working with the New Zealand Government, and you'd been on the job and not autopilot, you'd have responded. But that is so much the Howard Government. It operates like an opposition. It doesn't accept responsibility. Once you're in government you are responsible. The buck stops with you. You fix it. You don't campaign on it, you fix it. We've seen that with the refugees recently. They campaign on it, but they don't fix it. In opposition, that's fine. In government, you take responsibility. That's what I'm about.

 JOURNALIST: Just on that issue of the refugees…a boat has been turned away… Ashmore Island. Is that a realistic solution…?

 BEAZLEY: Whatever the Government is doing, it's not deterring it, is it? We're against undermining the immigration program of this country with illegality. We had it under control when we were in operation. It overwhelmed them and they let 136 boats through and decided a few weeks before an election to deal with the 137th. Now they've got a problem with the 138th and the 139th. So, clearly, the way they dealt with the 137th didn't work in terms of deterring people. I think people would ask the logical question

 when you look at the expense of all this: Is putting folk in an Australian-taxpayer subsidised, enormous, comfortable - and rightly so - operation, ultimately with the possibility of coming to this country, as the Prime Minister admits himself. Is that a deterrent? You'd have to say, probably not.

 What's the solution? The solution is an international agreement starting with a bilateral one between Australia and Indonesia in which they agree to take the refugees back and we agree to take a fair share of them within our refugee ceiling so that they don't have to feel that the only way they can come here is illegally. That's what we've got to do. That's the fix. But we all know that probably of all the political parties in this country, only the Labor Party can do that one.

 JOURNALIST: Isn't it easier to say we'll have a bilateral agreement with the Indonesians than the reality of putting it into place?

 BEAZLEY: We put it in place with the Chinese. We had it in place, if you'll recollect, when the Vietnamese boat people started to turn up in Australia. That's exactly the way we did the fix at that point of time. It's a question of good relationships and it's a question, of course, of funding. We would have to support that operation. It's a question of getting the United Nations into the frame and doing clearance properly in the camps in Indonesia. And then it's a question of being prepared to accept your part in the process. We have 12,000 a year that we accept under our UNHCR obligations. Within those numbers, this would be a problem easy to contain.
