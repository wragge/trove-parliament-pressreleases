 SUBJECTS: Debate, Charter of Budget Honesty

 JOURNALIST:

 What was your reaction to the debate last night?

 TREASURER:

 I thought it was an interesting debate, it covered a lot of issues. Obviously, it covered unauthorised boat arrivals, some of the economic issues and I thought it was, I'm not sure it was gripping television last night, I'm not sure what it will rate, but for those of us that are interested in politics it was an interesting debate on some substantive issues.

 JOURNALIST:

 And the consensus is that Kim Beazley had a very significant victory.

 TREASURER:

 They had a poll in the Channel Nine studio and that is what that poll showed. But of course polls vary according to how you choose the people that vote, what the sample size is, and there is an old truth in politics that the only poll that counts is the one on Election Day.

 JOURNALIST:

 They were chosen as a fairly wide selection though werenï¿½t they, a cross section of the public.

 TREASURER:

 Sure, if you took a poll of the audience that was in the Channel Nine studio that night, that was the outcome. But if you take different polls, you get different outcomes. So, I think that the important thing in the campaign is going to be the issues as they unfold, particularly the issue of leadership, and as the campaign goes on, and there is another four weeks, the leadership is going to be a very critical part of this particular campaign.

 JOURNALIST:

 Apparently the issue of the GST, if you look at the poll that was taken yesterday, that really, that really cost the Prime Minister, the GST is still a bugbear out there, isnï¿½t it?

 TREASURER:

 No, I think the worm measures reactions to phrases and phraseology and all of that kind of thing. But the worm turns and I wouldn't, I wouldn't take all of my political views from worms.

 JOURNALIST:

  

 On the issue of leadership last night, clearly Beazley won.

 TREASURER:

 No, last night amongst the studio poll of Channel Nine, amongst those people that were polled, that was the outcome. But I think if you look at the issues, I think if you look at the way the campaign is going, I think you can see that obviously it is going to be a tight race, but I think that Mr Howard has the credentials and we'll see how people vote on polling day. That's the one that we're interested in here.

 JOURNALIST:

 The Prime Minister wasn't really at his best though, he was fidgety, uncomfortable.

 TREASURER:

 I didn't think so, I thought he looked pretty good, to me.

 JOURNALIST:

 Are you sure?

 TREASURER:

 Yes. He looked pretty good, he looked pretty good to me. Oh look, everyone gets nervous before a debate. I'm sure if we were all doing a debate, we would all be toey too. And I'm sure Mr Beazley was nervous,  ï¿½I'm sure Mr Howard was nervous, but no more nervous than you would expect with a debate on national television with a lot riding on it &

 JOURNALIST:

 Wouldn't it have been important to have the Charter of Budget honesty out there to debate? I mean shouldn't it have been released before the two perhaps Prime Ministers go head to head?

 TREASURER:

 Look, the Charter of Budget Honesty is something that this Government introduced to stop anybody ever engaging in the kind of fraud that Mr Beazley engaged in prior to the 1996 election, when Mr Beazley ran around during that election campaign as Finance Minister, hiding the fact that his Budget was $10,000 million in the red. Now because of the Charter of Budget honesty you can't do that anymore. The Charter of Budget Honesty is really the Beazley Honesty Bill. It is to prevent anybody ever behaving like Mr Beazley again. And what that means, is, that we go into this election in the knowledge that the Budget is in small surplus. What it means is, if you want to rollback, you'll be kicking the

 Budget into deficit. If you want to engage in new spending you'll be kicking the Budget into deficit and increasing interest rates. And that is the reason for having it, to make it clear that anybody who wants to rollback or engage in new expenditures, risks driving the Budget into deficit and putting up interest rates. That is the way in which this campaign is being fought.

 JOURNALIST:

 Wouldn't it have been better though to have it there before last night, before they went head to head, perhaps the only time they're going to do it, to actually have the state of the books, to talk about you know, policies and what-have-you.

 TREASURER:

 Well we know what the state of the books are. The Budget is in small surplus. You can't add anything to that. And knowing what the state of the books are, it means that the policy of rollbackwards risks driving the Budget into deficit and putting up interest rates, the policy of new spending on the Noodle Nation and other fantasies of Mr Beazley, risks the same thing.

 Thanks very much.
