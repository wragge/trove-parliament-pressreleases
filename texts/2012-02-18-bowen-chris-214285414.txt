 SIXTH BOAT SINCE TONY ABBOTT SAID ‘NO’   

 The sixth asylum seeker boat since Tony Abbott ended talks with the Government to allow for  offshore processing was intercepted overnight, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship,  Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said today.   

 Mr Bowen said Tony Abbottâs relentless negativity showed the Opposition Leader had no  qualms about putting his own political interest over the national interest.   

 “Tony Abbott is refused to work with the Government to implement offshore processing, even  saying ânoâ to reopening a processing centre on Nauru - rejecting his own policy,” Mr Bowen  said.   

 “We've always said that without a genuine deterrent such as the Malaysia Arrangement, the  boats will keep coming. This is another boat you can chalk this down to the negativity of  Tony Abbott.   

 “Cheap shots at the expense of children and other vulnerable asylum seekers in community  detention seems to be the extent of the Coalitionâs contribution to this issue.    

 “Australians have no choice but to conclude that Mr Abbott prefers to see more boats arrive  because he believes itâs in his political interest.”   

 Mr Clare said boats would continue to come to Australia unless the Coalition was willing to  work with the Government to deter asylum seekers from taking these dangerous boat  journeys.   

 “In the three months after Mr Abbott said no to our legislation the number of asylum seekers  tripled,” Mr Clare said.    

 In the three months before Mr Abbott said no to our legislation in September, 12 boats with  764 people arrived. In the three months after Mr Abbott said no, 30 boats and 2,204 people  arrived.    

 “This shows the boats will keep coming as long as Mr Abbott says no,” Mr Clare said.    

 “If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must stop saying no and pass our  legislation to allow asylum seekers to be processed offshore in Malaysia and Nauru.”    

 The Government is prepared to work with the Coalition to see offshore processing legislation  pass through the Parliament. That included offering to establish a centre on Nauru to  complement the Malaysian Arrangement.
