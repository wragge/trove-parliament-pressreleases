 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - 6PR STUDIOS, PERTH,  7th MARCH 2002

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 Subjects:  GDP figures; DSD allegations; mandatory detention; US steel tariffs

 JOURNALIST: …annual growth at 4.1 percent, quite a good result for Australia?

 CREAN: A good result but the concern still is that despite strong growth unemployment is still stuck at seven percent. Now why is it that the growth is not translating into lower unemployment? It’ s jobless growth and that’s got to be a concern. What is pleasing about this set of figures is that finally we’re starting to see some investment happening but most of the growth to date has been consumption driven. There’s a lot of this growth through defence spending as well but you need investment for the jobs. I might also point out that what is encouraging about this growth is it gets us back to where we were before the GST came in.

 JOURNALIST: The Government will argue that the growth will lead to lower unemployment figures.

 CREAN: Well let’s see it. Let’s see it. What are they now projecting will be the unemployment rate as a result of this growth? Let’s see what they say this is translating to in jobs.

 JOURNALIST: The figures do show a huge reduction in spending in cafÃ©s, hotels and restaurants so for the average Jo Bloggs is probably not really…

 CREAN: The other thing that really will be interesting is what’s going to happen to the housing market because the grant runs out in the middle of the year. What’s going to be the impact on the housing sector?

 JOURNALIST: Do you concede the figures will help the budget bottom line?

 2

 CREAN: Well I think that we’ll just have to wait and see what the Budget projects, but I think the key that we’ve got to look to is if there’s strong growth where’s the employment dividend? That’s the key factor here. The Government can’t claim credit for good growth unless it’s going to translate properly to jobs.

 JOURNALIST: …surplus though? I mean there was some doubt about that?

 CREAN: Well let’s wait and see what the Budget surplus is. I would be more interested to know what the Government’s hiding by way of expenditure. They still haven’t told us the full cost of the ‘Pacific Solution’. They know it’s costing more but they won’t tell us the figure. Now it’s those things that are going to impact upon the Budget bottom line for this year, these growth figures will have an impact in future years but not unless unemployment comes down to a significant extent.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean it’s been revealed in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald that late last year Peter Reith gave approval for the Defence Signals Directorate to increase their, to widen their abilities to monitor and interpret communications. Is that a bit of a problem that, you know, ordinary Australians have now, you know, really simply be spied upon?

 CREAN: It’s a big problem if this story is true. This was a Government that told us Australians weren’t being spied on and we found out they were. We were then told that DSD could not spy on Australians in Australia. This story suggests that Peter Reith on the 29th of October changed the rules to enable Australians to be spied on here. So not only were people being spied on, Peter Reith was introducing new rules that made it easier to spy on them. The other big problem out of this is it happened in the caretaker period. There was no discussion with us about the changed rules. This is Peter Reith up to the tricks again, spying on Australians and he’s got a bit of answering to do on this score.

 JOURNALIST: How do you get to the truth?

 CREAN: Well I think the opportunity is there through the Senate inquiries. I’ve said before that this is a Government that lied, spied and denied. We’re getting to the bottom of the lies. We know the Government’s continuing denials. Now there’s more evidence about the spying. This is a Government that will stop at nothing to save its hide. If it did it then, it’ll do it again. That’s why this whole murky story has to be exposed.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean, Labor For Refugees has been formed around the country, is it a problem for you because one of their policies seems to be an end to mandatory detention?

 CREAN I have committed the Party to reviewing its policy on asylum seekers. I believe we can come up with a solution that’s tough on border protection but compassionate. I think that there has to be a continuing commitment to mandatory detention for the initial checking stage and I know no one who argues against that principle. The issue is the length of time it takes and the circumstances in which people are held. These are subject matters for the review and that’s a review that we’re undertaking at the moment. If people have constructive contributions to make as input to that policy review we welcome it.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Crean is the Federal Government doing enough to oppose the thirty per cent import tariff that the US is imposing on foreign steel?

 CREAN: No, I don’t believe they are. What this Government has to do is to mobilise the coalition of anger against the US decision. It’s not just Australia that’s impacted upon. There are people in the APEC League and there are people in Europe. Australia should be taking the lead just as Labor formed the Cairns Group, just as Labor established APEC. This is what the Government should be doing now, taking a lead against the US decision. It’s a bad decision. It’s got to be turned around.

 JOURNALIST: Would Australia take a lead by withdrawing support for the war in Afghanistan?

 CREAN: Well I don’t make that connection but I do believe this is a Government that has continually dropped the ball on trade policy. It’s quick to go in terms of the terrorism and defence related issues but it’s always dragging its feet on trade. Don’t diminish our commitment on terrorism. Don’t diminish our commitment in terms of our alliance support but use the pressure more effectively and take a lead. Get the US to reverse this crazy decision.

 JOURNALIST: Do you think the WTO is too weak an institution to do anything about it?

 CREAN: No I don’t but I think it’ll take too much time. That’s why by all means go through the WTO but you’ve got to take decisive action now because this is a decision they’ve implemented. They’ve implemented it quickly. They’ve implemented it without much consultation. We’ve got to do our best to turn it round quickly. Every mechanism has to be used but the coalition of anger against this decision is the most effective way to go from here.

 ENDS.
