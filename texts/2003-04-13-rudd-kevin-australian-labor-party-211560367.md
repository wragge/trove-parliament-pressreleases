 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs   

 AUSTRALIA IS ONE OF THE 3 “OCCUPYING POWERS” IN IRAQ -  BUT AS HOSPITALS ARE LOOTED THE RED CROSS SAYS THE OCCUPYING  POWERS AREN’T DOING THEIR JOB   

 The Geneva Convention confirms that as one of the three combatant states in Iraq, Australia is  now one of the three “Occupying Powers” in Iraq.   

 Australia’s status as an Occupying Power has been confirmed by the UN Secretary General, the  British Government and even Prime Minister Howard (albeit with great reluctance).   

 The Geneva Convention outlines what precise responsibilities Occupying Powers have towards  the civilian population of the country they are “occupying”. These responsibilities include:   

 â¢ The maintenance of law and order;  â¢ The provision of health and hospital services to the local people; and  â¢ The operation of basic infrastructure, such as electricity, water and roads.   

 Australia’s responsibilities are therefore clear cut. That is why the statement yesterday by the  International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva regarding the looting of hospitals in Iraq -  and failure of the Occupying Powers to contain this looting - is of fundamental concern.   

 The Red Cross has said that in Baghdad alone (population 5 million) 39 of the 40 hospitals in the  city have been looted and are no longer operational (see www. ICRC.org).   

 The Red Cross has called on the Occupying Powers to restore order from the anarchy that has  prevailed in Baghdad (and other cities) for several days now.   

 The Red Cross’ calls have been matched by the various humanitarian agencies of the UN,  including UNICEF, the World Health Organisation, the World Food Program and the High  Commissioner for Refugees.   

 All have criticised the Occupying Powers (by definition including Australia) for not acting  decisively to prevent looting and, more broadly, discharging their legal obligations under the 4th  Geneva Convention to protect the Iraqi civilian population.   

 Labor’s challenge to Mr Howard, given his unique status as one of the three governments now  legally responsible for the political administration of Iraq, is to obtain the agreement and support  of US and the UK to restore order in the current anarchy so that at a minimum, the Red Cross and  the other humanitarian agencies can do their job to bring relief to the 23 million people of Iraq.   

 Ends 13 April 2003
