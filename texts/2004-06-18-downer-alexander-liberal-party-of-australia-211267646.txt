 MEDIA RELEASE 

 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER 

 AA 04 041 18 June 2004 

 Australian Aid for Sudanese Refugees 

 I am pleased to announce Australian aid of $3 million for victims of the conflict in Sudan.

 This is in addition to the $5 million to help displaced people in Darfur, southwest Sudan,  which I announced on 17 May.

 The Australian Government's latest contribution is for emergency humanitarian assistance for  Sudanese in refugee camps in eastern Chad. 

 It's estimated up to 200,000 Sudanese are now in camps in eastern Chad. Our funding will help  meet their most urgent needs, including health, shelter, food and water and sanitation.

 One and a half million dollars will be used for UNICEF activities and $500,000 each is being  allocated through World Vision, Care International and Oxfam, all of which have mounted  emergency programs in the camps.

 Australians can be proud of our timely and generous response to calls for humanitarian  assistance for the most vulnerable populations in Sudan and now the victims sheltering across  the border in Chad.

 Our capacity to help victims within Sudan is limited because humanitarian agencies are finding  it difficult to obtain the necessary visas and travel permits.

 Humanitarian needs in Darfur and eastern Chad continue to grow as attacks and atrocities  against the civilian population continue. The UN Security Council approved on 11 June 2004 a  resolution urging an immediate halt to violence in Darfur.
