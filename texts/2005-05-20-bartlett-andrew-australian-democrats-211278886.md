 Government Plays Pirates on Refugees, but Baulks at Stopping  Japanese Whale Hunters

 The Australian Democrats have condemned the Government for double standards on the high seas. 

 "The Australian Government doesnt baulk at breaking international maritime laws by boarding asylum  seekers boats and towing them out of Australian waters, but when it comes to protecting whales from  Japanese vessels, suddenly the Attorney General Mr Ruddock is afraid of being labelled a pirate, said  Democrats Environment spokesperson and Deputy Leader Senator Andrew Bartlett,

 Mr Ruddock said recently that Australia could be accused of piracy if Australia used its maritime patrol forces  to prevent Japanese ships killing whales in the Australian whale sanctuary in Antarctic waters. 

 "If Mr Ruddock is so committed to following the letter of the law the Government should support environment  groups who are taking domestic legal action against Japanese whalers. 

 The Attorney General and the Environment Minister Senator Campbell should ensure this matter is also  raised in the International Court of Justice.

 "We are disappointed that the Australian Government has dropped plans to propose a South Pacific Whale  Sanctuary at this year's International Whaling Commission meeting," said Senator Bartlett. 

 Current whale population numbers may still be well below what they were before commercial whaling was  widespread. With distant water fishing so much a part of our industrialised world, we cannot assume whales  are out of the danger zone. There is also no humane method of killing whales and little robust science on the  state of their populations.

 "Australia is a world-class, whale-watching destination. The Government cannot continue to put its faith in  diplomatic chitchat while Japan rides roughshod over the current moratorium on commercial whaling."
