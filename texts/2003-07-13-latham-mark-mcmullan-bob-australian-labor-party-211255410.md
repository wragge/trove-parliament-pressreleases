 Will this Government’s GST advertising ever end?   

 New advertisements from the Government about the supposed benefits of the GST  show that even after the Government broke all records spending an incredible $210  million dollars advertising its new tax they still aren’t satisfied.  Now the Government  has taken out a series of newspaper advertisements (see attached) in regional and  metropolitan newspapers talking up GST payments to the states.   

 This looks like another multi-million dollar government advertising campaign.  Peter  Costello should come clean on how much money is involved in this new round of  GST advertising.  The money would be better spent on basic services for the  Australian people rather than political point scoring against the states.   

 What a week of waste and mismanagement we saw in the last seven days from Peter  Costello.    

 â First we had Philip Ruddock’s border protection policy failure, where asylum  seekers reached Australia’s migration zone.  Minister Ruddock panicked and  sent the asylum seekers to Christmas Island - and then we learned there is  an estimated cost of between $10m and $20m to move them to the island and  reopen the detention centre. 

 

 â Then we saw Brendan Nelson’s cover-up fund - $12.6m put aside to cover-up the funding cuts buried in his failed university reform package.  When the  true extent of his funding cuts became clear on last Monday night, the fund  magically overnight became $38.6m, with $26m just plucked from nowhere.   

 â And then on Thursday, there was the Government’s mismanagement of its  Jobs Network system.  Minister Brough just got out the government  chequebook and bailed it out to the tune of $30m.  More money lost to  Australian taxpayers. 

 

 Peter Costello is the highest-taxing Treasurer in Australian history.  Yet he still wants  Australians to pay more for the fundamentals of life - to pay more when they go to the  chemist, more when they go to the doctor, and more to send their children to university.   

 No wonder people are asking ‘where’s the money going?’  Now we know the answer.   In one week alone, $70m was flushed down the toilet of government waste and  mismanagement.
