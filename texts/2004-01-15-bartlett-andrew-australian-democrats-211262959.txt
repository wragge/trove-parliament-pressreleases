 Discrimination, Bottlenecks and Appeal Delays Stopping  Skilled Migration

 Australian Democrats' Deputy Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, says expanding skilled  migration will not succeed unless the Government removes the discrimination and delays in our  migration system.

 "Most migrants have families, yet currently people with ill or disabled children, a same sex  partner, or aged parents face severe impediments," Senator Bartlett said.

 "In addition, an appeal against Department decisions for a skilled visa currently takes an  average of 601 days! Yet, nearly 60 per cent of appeals against the Department are successful.

 "There are long waiting lists for people who want their parents to migrate to join them in  Australia, and currently the Department will simply refuse a visa if a person has a disabled child  or spouse on the disgraceful and discriminatory ground that this presents too much of a cost to  the community."

 "Until we remove these unnecessary constraints, we will continue to struggle to get adequate  numbers and quality of skilled migrants, as we are competing against many other nations for  many of these skills.

 "Having such a dramatic shortage in trades like electricians, plumbers, bricklayers and  carpenters, in the first place, is a sign of a gross failure to provide training places.

 The Democrats have said all along that the dramatic leap in the size of the skilled migration  program in the past few years is a direct result of the total failure of the Howard Government to  provide training opportunities for Australians.

 The massive leap in the number of skilled migrants, is also a sign this Government has failed  badly in its handling of asylum seekers. There are enormous skills amongst many of the asylum  seekers which this Government has gone to such lengths to prevent from settling in Australia, 

 After spending so long creating an image of being tough on migration, now this Government  wants to open a selective floodgate to fix a mess of its own making, Senator Bartlett said.

 When so many Australians can neither afford nor access places at TAFEs and Universities to  improve their skills, it is outrageous that this Government is desperately looking to the quick fix  of importing a solution to the economic mess they have now created, Senator Bartlett said.
