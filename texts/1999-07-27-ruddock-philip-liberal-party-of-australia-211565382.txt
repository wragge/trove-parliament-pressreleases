  The Hon. Philip Ruddock MP

  

  Doorstop - Sydney - Re Port Hedland

  

  Interviewee: Philip Ruddock MP

  Date: 27/07/99

  Time: 16:50

  

  Ruddock:

  

 I had reports yesterday that there had been some disturbances 
and a number of escapes from the centre last evening. Most of the people 
who escaped have been recaptured and I think there are four still at 
large and we anticipate that they should be apprehended shortly. In 
relation to the disturbances obviously with a facility that is very 
much pressed at the moment, numbers are very large, and it is a situation 
we have to manage. It is an operational situation, and we have boosted 
the number of staff that we have, and we hope to be able to effect some 
removals that will release some of the pressure that has been in place.

  

  Reporter:

  

 But there has been a number of incidences over the 
last few days, how much can you stand, obviously things are out of control 
there.

  

  Ruddock:

  

 They’re not out of control. Obviously it is a facility 
that is pressed with very large numbers of people who are in a situation 
of some difficulty - as far as they are concerned, they are being detained. 
There are large numbers of people, and we are anxious to ensure that 
any claims that are made are dealt with as quickly as possible, that 
those people who have an entitlement to be here are released into the 
community, and those people who have no entitlement to be here are removed 
from Australia - and that is a process that is ongoing. It has been 
very much under pressure because of the large number of boat arrivals 
as well as the unauthorised arrivals at our airports and also with the 
increased activity in deducting people who are unlawfully in the Australian 
community.

  

  Reporter:

  

 So is the government making provision to housing more 
people, to have another facility other than Port Hedland, which sounds 
like it is overflowing.

  

  Ruddock:

  

 Well it is not over flowing. As I said we hope to 
be able to affect some removals during the course of this week, which 
will release the pressure on the facility. I made it clear some time 
ago that as we approached what were the optimum numbers for Port Hedland 
that we will have to look at contingency plans. We haven’t had to 
utilise those at this point in time but obviously we are continuing 
to review our needs and requirements.

  

  Reporter:

  

 I understand you have been offered something in the 
gold fields area.

  

  Ruddock:

  

 Lots of people make offers if they want to try and 
seek premises that are otherwise unoccupied. We have to evaluate the 
suitability of any premises for the purpose that we require them. We 
have to also look at our own ongoing needs and we have to also look 
at how secure the premises can be and how quickly they can be secured.

  

  Reporter:

  

 There is obviously a problem with security in the 
centre. You must be worried that there will more escapes.

  

  Ruddock:

  

 Well, there have always been escapes and the point 
that I have made over a period of time is these are not gaol, they are 
detention centres, and so the range of measures that you put in place 
are not the measures you put in place for gaol and you always run risks. 
Now if what you are saying to me is that we should be boosting these 
facilities so that they operate like gaols, I would like to hear the 
advocacy for that. The question of how you get the balance right is 
a serious question and the only point I make is, if there is a view 
within the community or within the media that we ought to have facilities 
that are like gaols, it would be good to hear your advocacy of that 
decision and make my dealings with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity 
Commission a lot easier. There are these questions about how you get 
the right balance.
