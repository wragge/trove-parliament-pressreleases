 SENATE ESTIMATES COMMITTEES 

 Highlights from Day One: 27 May 2013  

 Government revealed as incompetent and untrustworthy 

 Budget’s carbon price projections just wishful thinking  Senate Estimates heard today that the forward price on the European market for December 2016  carbon permits is $5.42.  This is less than half the $12.10 price contained in the Budget’s forward  estimates.   If the market is correct and the price in 2016 is only $5.42 there will be a $2b shortfall in  Government revenue in 2015-16 and $4b in 2016-17. 

 Meanwhile, of course, Australian business is currently paying $23 per tonne for its carbon emissions  while the current European price is about $4.75 per tonne.   No wonder so many Australian  industries are finding it difficult to compete in international markets. 

 Asylum seeker facts  Senate estimates heard that the:  ï· Number of asylum seekers estimated to arrive by boat in 2012-13 Budget - 5,400  ï· Number to actually arrive so far in 2012-13 - 22,276 

 ï· Number expected to arrive before end of 2012-13 - 25,000+  ï· Number of asylum seekers held in immigration network as at 30 April - 11,549  ï Number on Christmas Island - 2,495  ï Number at mainland detention centres - 6,818 

 ï Number held in other facilities and transit accommodation - 597  ï· Number on bridging visas at 30 April- 10,327  ï· Number in ‘community detention’ - 2,752  ï· Number of asylum seekers being held offshore  

 ï Nauru - 419  ï Manus Island - 294  ï· Number of asylum seekers who had arrived by boat held in detention when Howard  Government left office - 4 

 

 Department gone, waste continues 

 The Department of Climate Change was established as a separate portfolio agency in its own right in  March 2010.  It was abolished in March 2013.  Towards the end of its brief life it locked taxpayers  into a 15 year lease on office space in a six-star energy-rated building in Canberra at a cost of $158  million. The lease costs were in addition to the millions the Department spent on the offices’ luxury  fit out  including an executive wine fridge and multiple top-of-the-range coffee machines.  Now the  Department has gone but the lease obligation remains until December 2027.   In any other  Government waste like this would be a scandal.  In the present Government it’s routine. 

 Parliamentary shop in need of retail therapy  The Department of Parliamentary Services is spending $245,000 on a review of ways to boost sales  at the Parliament House shop, food outlets and specialist tours.   Given that food services are  already contracted and there are currently no specialist tours, the shop looks the main hope for  improvement.    

 According to the Department’s 2011-12 annual report the Parliament has nearly one million visitors  per year.  Yet the shop, which is run by the Department, had revenue of only $1.19m and a profit of  $110,368.  It’s hard to think of anyone other than a Government Department that could make so  little money from such a large captive clientele, or that would spend 20 per cent of its revenue and  more than twice its annual profit to find out why. 

 Labor’s claims of Section 457 visa rorts routed   In March this year, Julia Gillard claimed employers were rorting Section 457 visas:  “ … temporary  overseas workers are being brought in and taking jobs where there are Australians ready, willing and  able to do it”.  In April Immigration Minister, Brendan O’Connor, asserted that more than 10,000  workers were involved in these rorts.  But Departmental officials told Senate Estimates that just 170  out of a total of 29,100 employers who have sponsored an employee on a 457 visa have been  subject to sanctions for breaking the program’s rules.    

 Sick of work?  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry revealed that its employees took an average  of 15 sick days last year.  This is almost twice the public service median of 8.5 days.  Half of the  Department’s sick leave was taken by just 15% of its employees.  There is no requirement in the  Department for employees taking sick leave to produce medical certificates after a certain number  of days off but needless to say the bureaucrats said they were paying “very close attention” to the  situation.   All sounds a bit crook to me.   

 Overseas investors snub Tasmania  Not one overseas investor has taken up the offer under the Significant Investor Visa program to set  up business in Tasmania.  While 435 applications have been received under the scheme, which is  designed to attract migrant investors to Australia, none of the potential investors wanted to go to  Tasmania.  Says a lot about the way the Labor-Green Tasmanian Government has destroyed  confidence in the island State’s future.
