  MEDIA RELEASE

  

  Senator Andrew Bartlett

  Australian Democrats’ Spokesperson on Immigration

  

  6 APRIL 1999  99/188

  

  Temporary refugee places for Kosovo a red herring

  

  The Australian Democrats strongly believe the government should be 
willing to expand its h umanitarian and refugee intake to assist 
with the greatest refugee crisis since World War II.

  

 Senator Andrew Bartlett, Democrats’ spokesperson 
on immigration said concern about Australia offering temporary places 
for Kosovo refugees is a red herring by the Immigration Minister.

  

 “It is not about randomly scooping up 5000 people 
from Kosovo tomorrow and bringing them to Australia. To come in under 
the refugee program, people have to be assessed as suitable by the UNHCR, 
which cannot happen overnight.

  

 “Australia can and should indicate its willingness 
now to significantly increase our intake for the next financial year. 
It is almost certain that not all the families displaced from Kosovo 
are going to be willing or able to return,” said Senator Bartlett.

  

 “There is currently no Australian Consulate or Embassy 
in Albania or Macedonia. As a priority the Government must establish 
a temporary Australian Government presence to process immigration applications.

  

 “The Coalition must significantly and urgently increase 
Australia’s level of assistance with this tragedy.”

  

 This should include:

  

  ·  A significant and immediate increase in financial aid and 
technical support to address the urgent health crisis faced by the refugees;

  

  ·  Establish 
a temporary Australian Government presence to process immigration applications;

  

  ·  A 
guarantee to promptly process any migration applications from Kosovars 
under the existing special humanitarian program;

  

  ·  Agreeing 
to increase the total intake of our existing refugee program.

  

  “The  Democrats agree with the Immigration Minister, Philip 
Ruddock, that it is not appropriate for Australia to offer temporary 
asylum. Asylum is not genuine if it is only temporary and lasts only 
as long as the discretion of the government which is offering it.”

  

 “All people granted refugee status in Australia 
have the choice to return to their country of origin at a later time 
if they choose. The key issue is that it should be the choice of the 
refugee, not the country that offers asylum,” Senator Bartlett said.

  

 “I believe the level of concern expressed by Australians 
in recent days shows that as a community we would be willing to offer 
many of these people a safe place to rebuild their lives,” Senator 
Bartlett concluded.
