 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 ABBOTT GOVERNMENT’S CONTEMPT FOR THE UN SIGNALS A NEW LOW   

 A report by the United Nations into Australia’s treatment of asylum seekers deserves  to be treated seriously by the Abbott Government.    

 Sadly, however, Tony Abbott has launched an absurd attack on the United Nations  today, claiming the globally respected organisation would have more credibility if it  paid credit to the Abbott Government.   

 Instead of launching a cheap attack on the report’s author - Tony Abbott should be  providing an assurance that all the processing facilities Australia funds are run in a  safe, humane and proper manner.   

 A critical part of that is ensuring Australian funded facilities process people’s refugee  claims without delay.   

 The Australian people need to be assured our detention networks are run in a safe  manner.   

 Labor believes that men, women and children seeking asylum ought to be treated in  a safe, humane and dignified manner and not allowed to languish indefinitely in  detention facilities.
