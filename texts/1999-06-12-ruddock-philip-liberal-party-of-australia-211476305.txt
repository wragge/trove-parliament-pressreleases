  ILLEGAL BOAT ARRIVAL ON CHRISTMAS ISLAND

  PASSENGERS MISSING - FEARED DROWNED

  

  Five passengers from an illegal boat arrival on Christmas Island are 
mis sing and feared drowned.

  

 A boat arrived at Christmas Island on 11 June 1999 
at approximately 6.30pm EST. When it was apprehended by the Australian 
Federal Police, the vessel had four crew and two passengers on board.

  

 It is believed that there were several additional 
people on the vessel the whereabouts of whom are currently unknown. 
A search of the waters around Christmas Island commenced and one person 
was found alive, but exhausted, early this morning on a remote beach 
on the island. The search is proceeding to locate the other five passengers.

  

 The four crew have been detained by police and the 
three unauthorised arrivals have been detained under the Migration Act 
and held at Christmas Island. They will be transferred to Port Hedland 
detention centre when the whereabouts of the other passengers are known.

  

 "This unfortunate incident highlights the treacherous 
nature of illegal boat landings", Mr Ruddock said, "and shows 
the utter disregard of people smugglers for the lives of their desperate 
human cargo.

  

 “Australia will continue to be resolute in prosecuting 
the perpetrators of this gruesome trade and ensure that those who have 
no legitimate claim to remain in Australia are promptly returned,” 
Mr Ruddock said.
