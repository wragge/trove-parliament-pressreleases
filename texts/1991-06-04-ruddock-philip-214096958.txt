 NUMBERS OF ILLEGAL ENTRANTS

 The announcement by the Minister for Immigration Mr Hand that the number of illegal  entrants in Australia has been significantly reduced assumes that the Minister is  comparing like with like. On face value of course, a reduction of 12% in the number of  illegals is welcome news.

 The Minister, however, provides us with a clue that statistics in this area are notoriously  unreliable.

 H e admits that the reduction in numbers is, in part, a result o f overstayers regularising  their status. This correlates with the significant increase in the processing backlog for  change of status applications.

 Until recently, the number o f on-shore claimants for change o f status on refugee grounds  were being processed at the rate o f around 500 a year. However, there are now 14,000  claims in the system and this number is increasing at the rate o f 1000 per month and  expected to peak at 20,000 by the end o f the year.

 The total number o f people applying for grant of residence status in Australia, in all  categories, has increased dramatically since the early 1980s, from around 7,000 in 1980/81  to over 36,000 in 1989/90. It would be interesting to see how the figures in this area have  changed in the past 12 months.

 Added to this are the 20,000 PRC nationals in Australia prior to the Tienanmen Square  incident who are eligible for 4-year temporary entry permits.

 Without wishing to reflect on the integrity of the Minister, the statistics would be more  meaningful if he could state quite categorically the number o f illegals who had in fact left,  or been forced to leave, the country, rather than being shifted from one category to  another.
