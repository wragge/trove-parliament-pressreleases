 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 15 October 2014   

 Australian born babies should not be deported  to Nauru   

 Babies born to refugee parents in Australia should not be deported to Nauru while any appeal to  today’s ruling in the Federal Circuit Court is being heard, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “The Abbott government mustn’t jump the gun and use today’s ruling to start dumping these babies  on Nauru,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Any appeal to today’s ruling must be respected and I call on the government to let that happen  before it removes any children from Australia.   

 “This is about whether these babies are given the opportunity to have a childhood or not.   

 “The government must commit to keeping the affected families and babies in Australia, while the  legal arguments are heard.   

 “Exposing families and children to the shocking conditions in the Nauru camp is nothing more than  government sanctioned child abuse.   

 “Every child who is dumped on Nauru is put at risk and they should all be released before more  damage is done.”
