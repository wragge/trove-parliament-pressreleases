 OFFICIAL OPENING OF GP PLUS SUPER CLINIC MODBURY    

 The GP Plus Super Clinic Modbury is providing more comprehensive and convenient  health care in the local community, Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek said  today.   

 Joining Federal Member for Makin Tony Zappia for the new clinicâs official opening  ceremony today, Ms Plibersek said the facility was a good example of what can be  achieved when governments work together for the good of local communities.   

 “I am very pleased that we have been able to work closely with the South Australian  Government to make this clinic a reality,” she said.   

 “We have provided $12.5 million for the clinic, which has been matched by the South  Australian Government."   

 “This clinic will bring together a variety of health professionals under one roof to work as  a team to provide patients with the best possible overall care.”   

 Mr Zappia said the Super Clinic would provide better access to high quality health care  in Modbury.   

 “Bringing together a range of health services under one roof makes life so much easier  for people already struggling with health problems,” said Mr Zappia.   

 The new clinic, which has been operating since the end of last year, is built on a âhub  and spokeâ model.   

 Both the âhubâ clinic in Smart Road, adjacent to the Modbury Hospital Emergency  Department, and the âspokeâ clinic in Gilles Crescent, Hillcrest, are operating out of new  purpose-built premises and focus on clinical services including chronic disease  management, health promotion and early intervention services.   

 Services offered at the Smart Road clinic include general practice, a variety of nursing  services, dentistry and medical specialist services, as well as allied health including  physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dietetics, diabetes nurse education and mental  health services.   

 The Gilles Crescent âspokeâ clinic targets the health needs of the local Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander community, a wide cross-section of refugee communities, people  who are financially and socially disadvantaged, and children and families with specific  health needs.   

 The GP Plus Super Clinic Modbury will also have a strong emphasis on education and  training for nursing and allied health students and will be seeking accreditation to  supervise GP registrars.   

 The Australian Government is making a significant investment in GP Super Clinics and  has committed around $650 million to build more than 60 GP Super Clinics around  Australia and to upgrade and extend around 425 existing general practices, primary  care and community health services, and Aboriginal Medical Services.    

 There are now 42 GP Super Clinics either open, providing early services or under  construction.
