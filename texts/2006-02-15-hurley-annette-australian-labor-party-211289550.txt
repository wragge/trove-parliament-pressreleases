 Senator Annette Hurley LABOR SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA 

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR CITIZENSHIP AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS

 Report into ACL Pty Ltd’s refugee settlement  services show that an independent inquiry is  necessary   

 

 The “Fiora Report” into ACL Pty Ltd’s current refugee settlement practices under  its Government funded International Humanitarian Settlement Services tender,  including the tragic death of Burundian refugee Richard Niyonsaba, shows that  an open and independent inquiry is necessary.   

 “Many questions still remain unanswered regarding the sad death of young  Richard Niyonsaba. Some such questions include why the ACL caseworker was  not notified of his serious medical condition and why medical judgements about  the child’s health were left to an uninformed caseworker with no medical  background?”   

 “I welcome the changes to operations that have already been adopted by ACL  however, I note that the author of the report, Mr Richard Fiora, is from the firm  Banki Haddock Fiora, who have provided legal services to ACL since 2000. 

 Many of the refugees and their supporters did not participate in this enquiry. Mr  Fiora therefore relied heavily on the testimony of ACL managers and  caseworkers.” 

 

 Senator Hurley has expressed concern that the report was released one day  after the Senate Estimates hearing into refugee settlement services.    

 “So far this week during Senate Estimates we’ve seen ministers gagged by the  Government, key officials not turning up after Senators being assured they  would, and now a crucial report being released one day after the relevant  Estimates Committee has sat. These are all examples of the Howard  Government’s continual suppression of enquiry”
