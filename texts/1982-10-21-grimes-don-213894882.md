 STATEMENT BY SENATOR DON G RIMES, SHADOW MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY

 Government takes migrant payment rises - and more

 While the Government professes to have a concern for new settlers,  its policies towards refugees and migrants in hostels show how  bogus that is.

 From next month migrants and refugees in Commonwealth hostels  will lose the rise in their social security payments - and more.

 Most new arrivals are oh unemployment, sickness or special  benefit. At present, if they are single they keep $25.55  out of their $58.10 a week benefit, while the hostel takes  $32.55. If they are m a r ried, they keep $50.50 of their 

 $123,60 benefit, while the hostel takes $73.10.

 New instructions have been received in the Department of Social  Security that from the beginning of November when pensions and  benefits are increased, hostels will be snatching back a  great deal more of -their social security cheques.

 If they are single, the new benefit rate is $64.40, of  which the hostel will take $42.95 a week, while the migrant  keeps only $21.45. If married,, the new rate is $128.80,  of which the hostel will take $85.85, while the couple will 

 have only $42.95 a week between them. .

 The proportion the migrant is allowed to keep of his or her  social security payment has dropped from 44% or 33%, with  the hostels' cut going up to 67%.

 How are new arrivals expected to cover clothing, transport  telephone and other costs, including those associated with  job seeking, on $21v45 a week?

 How are they to save the bond money they will need when 

 they have to move out of the hostels? Â·

 I doubt if Mr Newman, the Minister for Administrative Services,  considered migrant needs when he  approved the hostels taking  not only the whole of the $6.40 increase, but an additional  $3.10 they- are presently receiving.

 However, it is the responsibility of Senator Chaney, as  Minister for Social Security, to ensure that migrants and  refugees whose sole income are social security benefits are  not fleeced by his Ministerial colleague.
