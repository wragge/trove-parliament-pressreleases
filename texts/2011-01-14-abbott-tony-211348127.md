 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH   

 14 December 2011   

 TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  SYDNEY 

 

 Subjects: Craig Thomson; ministerial reshuffle; Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard; industrial relations; border  protection.   

 E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 The news today is that Fair Work Australia has yet again delayed the conclusion of its investigation into the  misuse of Craig Thomson’s credit card. This investigation has now been going on for more than two and a  half years and it is still being dragged out.    

 There are four essential facts here: first, Craig Thomson’s credit card was most definitely misused; second,  there was contact between the Prime Minister’s Office and Fair Work Australia over the conduct of this  investigation; third, Fair Work Australia officials have on a number of occasions told Senate estimates that it  would be concluded by the end of this year; and fourth, it has now been delayed well into the new year.   

 I think the public are entitled to feel that someone is being ripped off here. I think that the 70,000 lowly paid  workers of the Health Services Union are owed an explanation as to what happened to their money. They  know that justice delayed is justice denied and they want justice to be done here.    

 Now, Fair Work Australia must give the Australian public and in particular the 70,000 members of the  Health Services Union an explanation as to why this investigation just keeps dragging on and on and on.  Surely the evidence as known to the public is pretty clear. So, why is Fair Work Australia constantly  dragging the chain here? Second, the Government needs to come clean and give the public an assurance that  there has been no political interference in this investigation.    

 Now, just on the cabinet swearing-in. It’s pretty clear that this was a reshuffle from weakness. This reshuffle  was about the Prime Minister buying the loyalty of the faceless men who put her into office and who were  thinking of going over to Kevin Rudd. Now, it’s also pretty clear by the reaction to the reshuffle that it  hasn’t isolated Kevin Rudd, it’s goaded him.    

 Now, the longer this government goes, the clearer it is that no cabinet that includes both Julia Gillard and  Kevin Rudd can function effectively for the public good. One or other of them has got to go if the Australian  people are to get the good, united government that they deserve. All this reshuffle has done is demonstrate  that this is a divided and dysfunctional government.

 QUESTION:   

 With the Craig Thomson matter, why do you suspect it’s taking so long or why do you suspect that they’ve  delayed coming back with their findings?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, plainly this investigation is fraught with significance for the future of this government and that’s why I  think it’s vital that Fair Work Australia offer the public a detailed explanation as to why it is taking so long  and this is why it’s vital that the Government provide an assurance to the Australian public that there has  been no further political interference.    

 QUESTION:   

 So, do you think they’re holding back, what, to favour the Prime Minister?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, this is what the Prime Minister has to explain. I mean, it would be I think an absolute travesty if the  Prime Minister was to go on holidays without offering an explanation to the Australian public why this  investigation has taken so long and without giving the Australian public and the Health Services Union’s  70,000 members an assurance that there has been no further political interference in this investigation.    

 QUESTION:   

 Why is it an issue if Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard don’t get on and they’re in cabinet together? I mean,  that’s what happened with John Howard and Peter Costello. It didn’t seem to affect their relationship,  working-wise.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 The fact is that this is a Foreign Minister who has been frozen out of key government decisions. The Foreign  Minister wasn’t informed about the so-called East Timor Solution, he wasn’t involved in the Indonesian  cattle sales disaster, he wasn’t informed about the Malaysian people swap. The Government decided to un-stuff a stuff-up and resume uranium sales to India, the Foreign Minister was in India at the time and he  wasn’t informed. He wasn’t consulted or part of the decision to unilaterally suspend the Australia Network  tender process and give the deal to the ABC. These are five major Government decisions where the Prime  Minister and the Foreign Minister should be working in lockstep and the Prime Minister and the Foreign  Minister can’t even speak to each other let alone work with each other. We’ve got a crisis unfolding in PNG.  I bet the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister haven’t spoken about that either and yet surely if Australia  is to respond appropriately they should be working together, not taking potshots at each other.    

 QUESTION:   

 Just on the new Cabinet, will you be changing your tactics next year, because of the new opponents?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, it doesn’t matter who my opponent is, my task is the same. Every day, every week, every month until  the election, my task is first to point out the deficiencies in a bad government getting worse and second to be  a credible alternative and I think that on any fair-minded reading of the year we’ve been pretty good at both.   

 QUESTION:   

 3 

 

 Mr Abbott, there has been a bit of a dispute happening on some of our ports at the moment. Eric Abetz says  that Bill Shorten needs to sort of get involved. Is that something you support and would a Coalition  Government get involved in this dispute?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I think it’s very noticeable that industrial disputation has dramatically increased in recent times under the  Government’s legislation and I think that legislation which is producing more industrial disputes not less is  legislation that’s obviously far from perfect.   

 QUESTION:   

 So, would you favour, though, more intervention in this particular matter?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I think that this is obviously an issue for the Government. It is happening on the Government’s watch. It is  happening under the Government’s legislation and I think that it is up to the Government to explain how it  can possibly be in Australia’s national interest at a very difficult economic time for these kind of disputes to  be happening.   

 QUESTION:   

 There has been a child in Broken Hill who was banned from going to school because her parents were in a  same-sex relationship. It’s a Catholic school. Did they make the right call by doing that?   

 TONY ABBOTT:    

 Look, I think it’s always a matter for the school authorities to make those sorts of calls.    

 There’s one other subject that I’d like to just touch on and that is the arrival of yet another boat. So far there  have been eleven boats in the nineteen days since the Government announced that boat arrivals would be  given bridging visas. Now, these bridging visas are obviously a very, very serious problem. The fact that  illegal arrivals by boat are getting bridging visas, being released into the Australian community with work  rights is plainly acting as an enormous incentive for people to get on boats and risk their lives at sea.    

 This is a government which has effectively given the people smugglers back their business model. In fact,  this government is the people smugglers’ business model. This is a government which has put the welcome  mat out there for the customers of the people smugglers and if this government is serious about stopping the  boats, it has got to come up with a real plan and it has got to do it now because the problem is now.   

 QUESTION:   

 The High Court has just struck down another ruling from the Immigration Department concerning an  Afghan refugee who was refused a visa for his mother, I believe. They’ve said that the Immigration  Department have made a mistake. Is this another embarrassment for the Government?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, this is a government which just has embarrassment after embarrassment when it comes to border  protection issues. This is a government which lacked the magnanimity to leave well enough alone - to leave  the Pacific Solution in place. Everything that this government has done has ended badly when it comes to  border protection and the latest disaster has been the announcement that illegal arrivals by boat will get these

 bridging visas. The rate of arrivals has doubled since that government announcement. This whole bridging  visa process is obviously exacerbating the problem and the Government must deal with it urgently.
