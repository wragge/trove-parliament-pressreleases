 Address To The National Press Club  Speech - 21st November 2007 

 Six weeks ago, I said this election was about the future versus the past.  Six weeks later, nothing has changed.  

 On Sunday morning Australians have the chance of waking up to a new  government, with new leadership and a new plan to deal with the major  challenges our nation faces in the future.  

 Or Australians can wake up with the same old government - a  government that’s lost touch; a government with no fresh ideas  for the future; a government that’s lost its way.  

 The core choice for this election is this:  new leadership with a positive plan for Australia’s  future - or a tired government after 11 years desperately clinging onto political power.   

 My election campaign has been about how Australia can meet the challenges of  tomorrow. Mr Howard’s election campaign has been about fighting the battles of  yesterday. That’s the difference between us.  

 And nowhere is the difference more stark than my plan to build a world class  education system for Australia, as opposed to Mr Howard’s satisfaction with the  status quo.  

 My plan is to move Australia up the international batting order in education. Mr  Howard remains content to see Australia fall further behind. Our competitor  nations are right now investing massively in the education systems of the future.  

 While we have been sitting on our hands, watching them pass us by.And because  the quality of our education system will fundamentally determine the rich and poor  nations of the 21st century, the time for action is now.  

 The need for action has become urgent. There is now no time to delay. Australia  needs new leadership today to take our country forward - not let it fall further  behind.  

 New leadership which identifies our nation’s future challenges and has a plan to  tackle those challenges head on.  

 A plan for long term prosperity beyond the mining boom by building a world  class education system.  

 A plan to build 21st century infrastructure.   

 A plan for decisive action on climate change and water.  

 A plan to take responsibility and to save and improve our public hospitals.  

 And a plan to re-engage an independent Australian voice in the affairs of 

 Kevin Rudd

 the world.  

 I’ve been outlining my plans for Australia’s future since the first day I became  leader of the Australian Labor Party. By contrast, Mr Howard has outlined no such  plans.  

 Three days before polling booths open, Australians are entitled to ask:  

  z What is Mr Howard’s plan to build  prosperity beyond the mining boom?  

  z What is Mr Howard’s plan to give our children the best start in life with a 

  world class education system in the future?  

  z What is Mr Howard’s plan for the reform of our national hospital system?  

  z What is Mr Howard’s plan for action on climate change - and long water 

  security?  

  z What is Mr Howard’s plan to alleviate the pressures on working families?  

  Because as we near the end of this election campaign, we are none the wiser as  to what Mr Howard’s future plans for us all might be.  

  All we know about is his plan for the future is a plan for retirement. A plan to hand  the prime ministership to Peter Costello - without Mr Costello having to face the  people.  

  Whatever happens this Saturday, and whoever wins this election, we know one  thing for certain. The world will wake up to on Sunday morning and will be a world  undergoing rapid change.  

  A world where despite our great strengths, Australia risks being left further  and further behind.  

  A world where our competitors are preparing for tomorrow’s challenges by  investing in the education, skills and training of their people.  

  A world where our competitors are investing increasingly in the new  infrastructure and new technologies of the future.  

  A world where our competitors are preparing for the new low carbon global  economy, and building the clean green energy industries of the future.  

  A world where our competitors are already anticipating the ageing of their  populations and reforming the delivery of their health care and hospitals  accordingly.  

  Saturday will decide whether Australia gets stuck in the world’s slow lane, letting  other nations pass us by. Or whether Australia decides to shift up a gear so that  we can properly realise our true potential as a nation.  

  Because more than ever Australia needs a government that will help the nation  fulfil its promise, rather than a government that makes promises it can’t fulfil.  

  Mr Howard has made no convincing case as to why he should be returned for a 

  Page 2 of 10

  fifth term. His campaign has been almost exclusively negative. He has not  advanced a positive reform agenda for the future because he has concluded he  will not be there for the future.  

  Mr Howard’s government has become complacent on policy because a long time  ago it concluded it was politically invincible. The history of the Howard  Government for much of the last decade has been one not of opportunities  seized, but opportunities squandered.  

  He has governed in easy times with no regard for the challenge that lies ahead. It  has been a decade marked by opportunities squandered.  

  I would have given my eye teeth to have been part of a government at a time  when Australia has been so richly blessed by the global resources boom.  

  No nation has so singularly benefited from the resources boom as Australia has  done in recent years. Yet no government has so singularly squandered the  opportunities delivered by that boom than Mr Howard’s government.  

  The Reserve Bank says there have only been two booms like this in the recorded  economic history of this country. The Reserve Bank tells us it is currently  contributing 8 per cent to our gross national income, or $80 billion per year.  

  And it’s been estimated that the mining boom has added $400 billion to the  budget bottom line over the decade.  

  But Mr Howard’s government has failed to harness the proceeds of the boom  today to invest in the productive capacity we need for the economy of tomorrow.  

  Just as it has failed to ensure along the way that the boom delivers not just for the  national economy as a whole but for working families and the household  economy  as well.  

  Our core charge against Mr Howard’s government is as follows:  

  z Mr Howard has lost touch with working families.  

  z Mr Howard’s government after eleven years in office has gone stale and no 

  longer comprehends the challenges of the future.  

  z Mr Howard’s government is instead almost entirely preoccupied with the 

  handover to Mr Costello - with Mr Costello never having to face the  Australian people.  

  z And finally, Mr Costello as Prime Minister in waiting represents a risk for 

  working families who have not been told what his future plans are - other  than his longstanding determination to take WorkChoices further.  

  Mr Howard told Parliament earlier this year that “working families in Australia have  never been better off”.  

  Mr Howard’s Treasurer Mr Costello says there is no crisis in housing  affordability.  

  Page 3 of 10

  Mr Howard’s Families Minister Mr Brough says there are no problems in  childcare.  

  Mr Howard’s Communications Minister Senator Coonan says no one is  complaining about broadband speeds in metropolitan Australia.  

  Mr Howard’s Environment Minister Mr Turnbull says the government leads  the world on climate change.  

  What greater evidence do we need of a government that has fundamentally lost  touch with the Australian people.  

  It is a government that has become insensitive to the cost of living pressures  facing working families - rising interest rates, ballooning rents, petrol prices,  grocery prices and the cost of childcare, health and education.  

  There is no greater evidence of this than the double whammy working families  have suffered since the last election. Mr Howard promised at the last election to  keep interest rates at record lows.  

  They have risen six times since then - and first home buyers are now paying  nearly $3,000 per year more as a consequence of that broken promise.  

  And then there’s WorkChoices. Mr Howard didn’t say a word about introducing  WorkChoices before the last election. He then introduced the most extreme set of  IR laws Australia has ever seen.  

  Penalty rates, overtime and shift allowances have been stripped away. 3.6 million  Australians can now be sacked on the spot. Young adults straight out of school  are being expected to negotiate their wages and conditions directly with their 

  employers.   

  I can barely walk through a shopping centre in Australia without people telling me  about the impact WorkChoices is having on their lives.  

  Mr Howard these days treats working people as economic commodities. I do not.  And I never will.  

  That’s why I will abolish WorkChoices.  

  That’s why I will abolish AWAs.  

  That’s why I will restore decency and fairness to the laws governing our  workplaces.  

  Mr Howard’s government has not only lost touch. It has also gone stale and has  no fresh ideas for the future. The history of the Howard Government is so much a  history of a wasted mandate.  

  So many opportunities to take the proceeds of the mining boom and re-invest them in our schools, in our TAFEs, in our universities, in our entire  education and training system. But instead they disinvested.  

  So many opportunities to undertake fundamental national reform of our 

  Page 4 of 10

  public hospital system. But instead they disinvested.  

  So many opportunities to act on climate change, the great economic and  environmental challenge of our age. But instead they buried their head in  the sand.  

  So many opportunities to invest in long term water security. But instead  they preferred to blame the States.  

  Not to mention the opportunities presented to them each year through COAG to  continue the national microeconomic reform agenda by harmonising and reducing  the regulatory impost on business. Instead, they simply added to that impost.  

  The hallmark of this government is that of political management rather than policy  leadership. The bulk of Mr Howard’s energies are consumed in day to day political tactics rather than a strategy for long term economic reform.  

  It has been government by press release rather than policy innovation. And after  a season the press releases are forgotten until once again they have to be  recycled during the next election season.  

  In other words, this government has now lost sight of the fundamental purpose for  being in government. And that is, to undertake and drive the deep challenges of  national reform that are necessary to secure the nation’s future in an increasingly  competitive global order.  

  Rather than seizing the opportunity to tackle these challenges, Mr Howard’s  government has been consumed by a crippling leadership dispute. We are now  told this has been resolved. Mr Howard is asking the Australian people to elect  him on Saturday so he can retire.  

  It’s no wonder people are scratching their heads in bewilderment. This situation is  not just absurd - it is arrogant. If the Liberals are successful on Saturday, Peter  Costello will be handed the prime ministership without ever having to face the  Australian people.  

  Australians over the next few days are perfectly entitled to ask what Mr Costello  will do if he becomes Prime Minister. When Mr Howard stands here tomorrow for  his Press Club address, will he be speaking for himself? Or will he be speaking for Mr Costello?  

  Will Mr Howard, for example, tell you this about Mr Costello as Prime Minister in  waiting and his plans for Australia.  

  z That Mr Costello throughout his professional and political life has 

  campaigned for the introduction of a radical industrial relations system in  Australia that would deprive working families of practically all their remaining  rights.  

  z That Mr Costello was a co-founder of the H.R. Nicholls Society.  

  z That Mr Costello has campaigned for the abolition of the Industrial Relations 

  Page 5 of 10

  Commission; the abolition of remaining unfair dismissal protections; and for a  $3 an hour youth wage.  

  z That Mr Costello has said that WorkChoices is only the beginning.  

  The key test for Mr Howard when he stands here tomorrow is whether he will tell  you anything else about Mr Costello’s agenda.  

  For working families already struggling with cost of living pressures, Mr Costello’s  elevation to the prime ministership represents a real risk. Because from his public  statements over the past 21 years, there can be no doubt that Prime Minister  Costello would take WorkChoices further.   

  Australia needs new leadership and a new government, ready to roll up its  sleeves and prepare our country for the future. New leadership prepared to work  hard today to secure our prosperity tomorrow.  

  There is no more fundamental way to secure our future prosperity than through  education. Investing in people is the key to competitiveness in the global  economy of the future.  

  A highly skilled workforce will provide Australia the best insurance against the ups  and downs of the international economy - a workforce capable of adapting  quickly to the opportunities and challenges of the future.  

  But at a time when Australia desperately needs to be moving forward on  education, we find ourselves falling badly behind.  

  z Australia’s public expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP is not just 

  lower than many of the wealthier nations we compete against. It is even lower  than many developing countries like Tunisia, Cyprus, Slovenia, Mexico,  Poland and Portugal, Latvia, Estonia and Croatia.  

  z Australia’s secondary school retention rates are now lower than Lithuania, 

  Estonia, Peru, Chile, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Jordan.  

  z Australia is falling behind in the provision of qualified maths and science 

  teachers and researchers in our schools and universities, while the rest of the  world is training them in droves because they recognise maths and science  are the great enabling disciplines of the future economy.  

  z Between 1995 and 2004, Australia was the only economy in the developed 

  world to reduce its investment in universities, while the rest of the developed  world increased its investment by nearly 50 per cent in real terms.  

  z China is now turning out the largest number of tertiary graduates in the world 

  - more than two and a half million per year - which is more than the United  States, Japan and France combined. Russia is now turning out more than a  milion graduates every year, and Brazil and Indonesia together are training  another million.  

  z Australia is falling behind in the global digital revolution and the new skills 

  required in the global digital economy. Australia has one of the slowest and  most expensive broadband networks in the western world. When schools in 

  Singapore, Seoul and Tokyo have available bandwidths of between 50 and  100 Mbps and their counterpart schools in Australia have 1.5 Mbps, we have  a problem.   

  z And then there is early childhood education, where across all the developed 

  economies in the world, our national investment comes stone motherless  last.   

  And the list goes on. Mr Howard often talks about report cards for the educational  achievements of individual students.  

  The truth is if Australia was being issued with a report card comparing our  national investment in education against our competitor economies, we would find ourselves in the bottom half of the class and slipping further and further behind.  

  Yet Mr Howard continues to ignore the changing world around us.  

  Mr Howard’s government has failed to make the connection between investing in  education and economic growth - a connection that the fastest growing  economies of the 21st century discovered long ago.  

  Mr Howard’s economic strategy consists of hoping that the mining boom will last  forever, despite Mr Costello himself saying last year the mining boom had  effectively come to an end.  

  The core rationale for my education revolution is that investing in education builds  long term productivity growth and prosperity. That is why I have spent all year  laying out chapter after chapter of my education revolution:  

  z early childhood education;  

  z the adequate provision of maths and science teachers for our schools;  

  z Asian language education;  

  z state of the art trades training centres for all our secondary schools;  

  z computer terminals for all our secondary schools - Year 9 and above;  

  z an education tax refund to assist parents invest in their children’s computer 

  literacy at home;  

  z a national curriculum in English, History, Maths and Sciences for all 

  Australian schools; and  

  z a doubling in the number of university undergraduates and research 

  scholarships.  

  This is just a beginning. This is a long term challenge - and one I am determined  to focus on day, every week, every month and every year if I am elected.  

  Because no Australian government can ever afford to drop the ball on education  ever again.  

  If elected, I intend to become Australia’s education Prime Minister. My 

  Page 7 of 10

  education revolution is the centrepiece of my plan to tackle Australia’s  future challenges.  

  Australia needs new leadership on our economic infrastructure needs of the  future. Mr Howard says this is entirely the responsibility of the states.  

  Australia needs new leadership for the long term funding and reform of our  health system so that we can deal with, rather than avoid, the pressures  faced by our 759 public hospitals.  

  Mr Howard once again prefers to blame the states.  

  Australia needs new leadership on climate change, on emissions trading  and on renewable energy. Mr Howard remains in a state of denial.  

  Australia needs new leadership for long term investment in urban water  security. Mr Howard washes his hands of the problem and says it’s up to  the States.  

  Australia needs new leadership to cut the red tape burden on business. Mr  Howard pays lip service to regulatory reform but has failed to deliver.  

  Time and again we have seen how Mr Howard’s leadership is not up to meeting  the challenges of the future.  

  

  Mr Howard’s negative campaign  

  While we have spent the year outlining our positive plan for the nation’s future  and the nation’s families, Mr Howard’s desperate, negative campaign has rolled  on regardless.  

  I said at the beginning that my election campaign has been about facing the  challenges of the future, and Mr Howard’s campaign has been about fighting the  battles of the past.  

  Whether it’s unions, state governments, Mr Howard’s selective rendering of the  economic history of the 1980s, or declarations that the sky will fall in by Sunday  lunchtime, the common objective is the same: to avoid talking about the future.  

  Where in his relentless negative campaign has he recognised the role of people  like Bernie Banton, fighting for the interests of those injured in the workplace, only  to be attacked by Mr Howard’s headkicker-in-chief Mr Abbott.  

  Or where in his negative campaign Mr Howard has acknowledged that he has  withdrawn more than $1 billion worth of funding from the states for the public  hospital system while expecting the same public hospitals to treat more people  with less money?  

  And where in Mr Howard’s negative campaign does he acknowledge his own  record in the 1980s when as Treasurer he delivered interest rates of 22 per cent;  double digit inflation; double digit unemployment; four out of five budget deficits  and the deepest recession this country had seen since the Depression.  

  Page 8 of 10

  We have learnt from the experience of the 1980s. I pride myself on being an  economic conservative, committed to budget surpluses and the independence of  the Reserve Bank - all to keep downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. 

  This forms the economic bedrock of my plan for the nation’s future.  

  But Mr Howard has no plan for the future - other than to trot out the same old  political tricks from the past: run a negative fear campaign and spend like a  drunken sailor, all in the hope of holding onto political power.  

  The new leadership that I offer for the nation’s future is grounded in the basic  belief that we can build long term prosperity without throwing the fair go out the  back door.  

  I am not ideological. I am not dogmatic. But I am driven by a deep belief that our  country needs to change to secure a better future. If elected as Australia’s next  Prime Minister, I will implement the plan of action I’ve outlined today.  

  My commitment, if elected is to deliver concrete results by the end of my first  term. If elected, by 2010 I want to see:  

  z School students using the first of our state of the art trades training centres.  

  z New computers being rolled out for students in secondary schools across 

  Australia.  

  z Thousands of Australians acquiring new skills through our new training 

  places.  

  z Homes around Australia being linked to our new high speed national 

  broadband network.  

  z Improved hospitals and hospital services across the country.  

  z New urban water recycling programs up and running, and desalination plants 

  under construction.  

  z Real progress in harmonising State-based business regulation.  

  z Kyoto ratified and Australia playing a leading role in the international effort to 

  combat climate change.  

  z A national emissions trading scheme with interim carbon targets.  

  z Young families across Australia beginning to see their dream of home 

  ownership coming within reach through their First Home Savers Account.  

  z WorkChoices abolished and a fair and flexible system in its place.  

  Ladies and gentlemen, new leadership starts with identifying the nation’s future  challenges.  

  New leadership is about developing plans to deal with those challenges. Most  critically of all, new leadership is about delivering on those plans and being held  accountable for them.  

  Page 9 of 10

  Let me ask you this: If Mr Howard and Mr Costello are returned, does anyone  seriously believe that they will deliver on the 21st century education system,  broadband, hospital reform and the decisive response to climate change and  water that our nation needs?  

  The fact is, by 2010 Mr Howard will be gone. He will not be around to be held to  account. So what’s the point in re-electing Mr Howard?  

  If elected Prime Minister, I will be here for the long haul. I will be accountable to  the Australian people for the commitments I have made to them at this election.  

  Australia is a great country. But we are not yet as great as we can be. We should  be a nation leading the world on tackling climate change - not lagging behind.  

  We should be a nation leading the world with first-class hospitals - not an ailing  healthcare system. And Australia should be showing the world that you can  combine prosperity with fairness.  

  And above all else, we should have a world class education system, so that  Australia becomes a world leader and not  just an also-ran in the global economy  of the 21st century.  

  I stand ready to offer this country new leadership. After 11 years, it’s now time to  turn the page on this government. It is time for a new chapter in our nation’s  history to begin. I stand ready for the responsibilities of government.

  National Press Gallery Q&A Session 

  National Press Gallery Q&A Session  Press Conference - 21st November 2007 

  MIDDLETON: Jim Middleton ABC television news. One quick  question and one a longer one. You just talked about  accountability. If you are elected to office on Saturday, will you  pledge to hold a full-scale news conference after each and every  Cabinet meeting unlike the last three governments. And secondly,  you have spoken frequently in this campaign of not spending  more than you can afford, and yesterday when asked about it  again you invoked the warnings of the Reserve Bank about  inflation. But the one name you didn't invoke was Treasury. If you  do win on Saturday, on Monday you'll be presented with a very  large book from Treasury, which will go through in great detail what you promised. 

  RUDD: How many pages are in it, Jim?  

  MIDDLETON: I wish I knew. But, it will go through those and it will tell you  whether it thinks they are affordable or not. Will you accept their advice on the  affordability of those propositions if you win, or will you ignore it? If you do choose  to ignore it, what value is there in your promise not to spend more than you can  afford?  

  RUDD: Well let me take those questions in sequence. The first one I was not  anticipating because my efforts are directed at winning the election this Saturday.  That's where all my focus has been. But I have also said repeatedly throughout  this campaign that I believe in accountability. I’ve said, if you’ve read clearly the  text we put out to the Australian people on our views on press freedom, that we  think the balance at present, for example, on Freedom of Information has gone  wrong. Therefore, for example, we have a policy now to abolish conclusive  certificates - something which has been near and dear to the heart of various  journalists here not just in the last few days but across the last few years.  

  So consistent with that determination to be accountable, I am prepared to accept  the challenge that you've laid down. And to repeat the challenge so you don't  think that I'm squibbing it, that if we are elected, that subsequent to a Cabinet  meeting, I would present or the relevant ministers would present, for an  appropriate press conference to be accountable to you the ladies and gentlemen  of the press. Stop blanching, Joel. But our efforts at this stage are directed at  winning.  

  On the second point you raise, Jim, which goes to the question of financial  responsibility. Let me answer it at a couple of levels. We have been exceptionally  rigorous in the spending commitments that we have put forward for this election.  We, unlike the Government, have put forward a whole range of savings options  which the Government has not put forward and that's clear from the process  which has been under way.  

  Kevin Rudd

  We also have been very mindful of the public warnings by the Reserve Bank  about inflationary pressures, particularly the Reserve Bank’s upward revision of  the inflation forecasts for the period ahead, released in the Bank’s monetary  policy statement last Monday. And mindful of that, it simply reinforced my  predisposition to be modest in what we put forward by way of a platform to the  country and we did. We put forward a platform last Monday which represented  something less than one quarter - last Wednesday - something less than one  quarter of what Mr Howard had put forward on Monday.  

  In terms of the contents of Treasury’s blue book, first of all, you have to win an  election to be shown a copy, and that's a big challenge for us between now and  Saturday. I am always attentive to the advice of the likes of Ken Henry, who I  regard to be a first class public servant, who has served independently and  impartially governments of both political persuasions. We'll be very mindful of  what the Secretary of the Treasury says. But our commitment to implement our  program has been framed within an atmosphere of fiscal responsibility, reinforced  by the speech that I delivered at the Australian Labor Party launch last  Wednesday. And we would adhere to that commitment to fiscal responsibility.  

  One final point: when I talk about a razor gang, I'm dead serious. And it's probably  not the right town or a popular place to talk to talk about it here in Canberra. But I  have lived in Canberra, Therese and I have lived in Canberra and it just strikes  me as passing strange that this Government, which supposedly belongs to the  conservative side of politics, has not systematically applied the meat axe to its  own administrative bloating for the better part of a decade. I am not talking here  about a reduction in federal government services, I am talking about the  administrative budgets of departments. And therefore I'm very mindful of what can  be done through a razor gang process as far as non-core functions of government 

  are concerned. Combining those disciplines, which is essentially conservatism  and the way in which we have framed our spending commitments. Secondly the  fact that we unlike the Government, have put forward savings options and on top  of that our determination to implement a razor gang if elected, I believe we can  implement our full program in a fiscally responsible fashion.  

  PORTEOUS: Mr Rudd, Cinton Porteous from the 'Courier Mail' newspaper. You  just made a very strong pitch there to Australian voters saying you stand ready for  the responsibilities of government. When people go to the ballot box, they have a  choice between yourself and the experienced team of Mr Howard and Mr  Costello. As was pointed out, you have been head of the Labor Party for less than  12 months; you have no ministerial experience; your core economic team has no  ministerial experience. Why should voters believe you could be a good Prime  Minister given your lack of leadership experience?  

  RUDD: Well, when Mr Howard became Prime Minister in 1996 he had a truckload of experience. A truckload of experience as Treasurer delivering the country 22  per cent interest rates. A truckload of experience in delivering this country double  digit inflation, double digit unemployment, having delivered four of his five  Budgets as Budget deficits and having delivered us a recession deeper than  anything we’d seen since the 1930s. That was Mr Howard’s experience that he 

  Page 2 of 12

  brought to the table in 1996. Mr Costello, the Treasurer brought no experience of  ministerial office whatsoever. I ask people to place that in context. Secondly, our  plans for the future are clear cut and framed within a fiscal envelope and fiscal  environment of inherent economic conservatism. And that's because I take those  fundamental disciplines seriously as I have throughout my professional career. In  terms of familiarity of the machinery of government, I make another point. If  you’ve worked in the machinery of government as much as I have, at a State  level, at a Commonwealth level, in Australian missions overseas, and having  worked in business for a period of time, and having grown up on a farm in rural  Queensland - I have actually been around a bit and done a few different things.  

  I think it’s actually quite a reasonable proposition not to present myself to the  Australian people as a lifelong professional politician. I have done a bunch of  other things. And the large slice of those other things actually goes to the  machinery of government. I spent five years, for example, representing the  Queensland Government as its senior public service representative on the  steering committee of the Council of Australian Governments, where we spent our time negotiating major microeconomic reforms as officials like national  competition policy. I'm reasonable familiar with the machinery of government.  And, therefore, I would hope that the Australian people, in viewing that by way of  background and being mindful of the background which our opponents brought to  office in 1996, would make an appropriate decision come this Saturday.  

  GRATTAN: Michelle Grattan of the Age. Mr Rudd, Labor announced a business  advisory group headed by Rod Eddington, but I don't think it has actually added  members to that group. Do you intend to fill out the group and in government what  would be the mechanism for receiving advice from that group? Would it report to  you directly, or would it go through one of your ministers and if so, which one?  And could you also tell us something of the mechanism in government for getting  advice formally from the ACTU?  

  RUDD: Firstly on Rod Eddington. I think Sir Rod has been a great source of  advice to me personally and to Wayne Swan throughout the course of this year. I  value his counsel greatly. Secondly, in terms of the composition of the Council of  Business Advisors, that you refer to, that has been developed and we have a  panel of some six or seven individuals who I believe are ready to roll. On the  question of the broader advisory processes from the business community in to  government - my experience in the Queensland Government has always been 

  that having an open door with business and listening to corporations large and  small and also their peak bodies is the best way to proceed.  

  I was just having a conversation with someone before, I'll leave them unnamed in  case it embarrasses them, but they were from the National Australia Bank. That's  a big bank, it could be anybody - about this simple proposition which as you’ve  heard me speak of a lot and the Treasurer has taken objection to this, about how  you go about transforming our financial services sector into an export platform to  the rest of the world. It’s a very sophisticated sector, our funds management  sector is particularly of great depth and breath and density. I always asked myself  the question why can't we project this into the region as a major new export 

  Page 3 of 12

  business for the nation. In taking that further, both in terms of the taxation  arrangements which you have already indicated the reduction in the foreign  withholding tax, but also in how we re-badge and re-brand Australia as a funds  management capital for wider East Asia. We have just been talking about how  we'd do that consultatively with the peak bodies, IPSA, the Bankers Association  and the other peak bodies. The only way you deliver good outcomes here is if you  do it consultatively, and I very much believe in a ‘Team Australia’ approach.  

  The third part of your question was about the ACTU. I haven't given much thought  to that to be quite honest in terms of how all that would work, but I'm sure we'll  chat from time to time as appropriate.  

  LEWIS: Mr Rudd, Steve Lewis from News Limited. In the series of commitments  you just made - I was going to call them commandments, but there's 11, not 10 -  in the series of commitments you made…  

  RUDD: I’m more new testament than old, mate.  

  LEWIS: You made no mention, you made no mention of any measures to put, to  address cost of living pressures on working families, and yet that's been a  common theme throughout the last 12 months or so. In particular there is no  mention in your speech, in fact during most of your campaign, of grocery and  petrol prices which you have promised to address if elected. Therefore, can you  outline the benchmark by which voters, the electorate will be able to judge  whether a Labor Government has been successful in terms of tackling grocery  and petrol prices, keeping them lower. Or is this an irresponsible promise, on par  with John Howard's 2004 pledge to keep interest rates at record lows?   

  RUDD: Well Mr Howard stared down the barrel of the television camera and said  he would keep interest rates at record lows, and they went up six times since  then. What was doubly irresponsible is he knew he had no such power to  implement that promise, the problem is the Australian people believed him. And  are now paying through their wallets as a consequence of that. And you point to  the speech. The speech is not intended to be an exhaustive list at all in terms of  our commitments. And if you look at the range of policies we have out there on  national housing affordability, and on child care costs, just to name a couple. As  well as assisting families with the dental costs which their kids face, particularly in  those teenage years, and on top of that the education tax refunds - all of these  are designed to assist working families under financial pressure.  

  Many of you have been at press conferences where I have said - and said  repeatedly - I do not pretend to have a silver bullet on any of these questions, I  don't. But I do have a fundamental difference with Mr Howard who looks down the  barrel of a camera and says to working families they've never been better off. Let  me tell you, that's not my experience as I wander around Australia and talk to  people. Each of those measures delivers some relief to the family budget. And the  question which working families have asked me repeatedly around Australia is  this: Mr Howard and Mr Costello lecture us about how well the national economy  is going, then why am I finding my household economy - my household budget - 

  Page 4 of 12

  such a struggle?  

  BONGIORNO: Paul Bongiorno, Ten News. Mr Rudd, just wondering at this point  of the campaign, what odds you give yourself for winning, is it 60/40? Do you  believe that you are the red-hot favourite? And if you do win, are you satisfied  with the balance between civil liberties and national security, especially in light of  the Haneef affair, and the finding of a court recently that the AFP overstepped the  mark? Do you believe a whole range, a whole raft of laws relating to individual  rights and national security need review?  

  RUDD: On the first question, many of you heard me say this, let me say it loud  and clear. Whoever wins this election on Saturday will win by a nose. I mean it. If  you know what I know, in terms of travelling around the country, this is tough, ugly  and nasty and it's going to be trench warfare from here until Saturday. And this is  tighter than many people in this room may think. And so I regard our challenge -  which is to make history to win 16 seats and we have only won from opposition  twice since World War II - a huge challenge.  

  On the question of civil liberties and national security - this is always a tough one.  Let's just be blunt, it is, getting the balance right. We've been through so many  Shadow Cabinet decisions and discussions on this over the last several years and  we've had animated and passionate discussions about this. These things are not  just pushed to one side as if they don't exist. These are hard, difficult balances to  get. We are not Robinson Crusoe on this. Democratically elected governments in  the United Kingdom and elsewhere face precisely the same challenges. Principal  number one: is that families across this country expect an alternative government  or the current Government to take hard-lined, hard-nosed decisions to protect, not  only national security, but the security of families.  

  Therefore, when you are dealing with something as ugly as global terrorism it  requires a hardline approach. I therefore have fully supported the resourcing,  appropriately, of our security agencies, of our intelligence agencies. And as laws  have been passed through the Parliament you will have known over recent years  how many of those we have inserted appropriate amendments into and by and  large the Government’s accepted those amendments. Therefore, if you look at the specifics of say the Haneef case, the truth is I don't think any us on our side of  politics know precisely what's gone on there. Other than something smells. And  that's why I'm dead serious, whether we win the election or whether we don’t, that  there should be a full judicial inquiry into that matter so we can get to the bottom  of what went wrong. It's quite important because that then informs the future  debate about the nature of our laws, the implementation of our laws by the  relevant agencies, and let's have all those facts on the table. They are not  currently on the table. And that's the problem.  

  COMPARE: The next question is from Laura Tingle.  

  TINGLE: Laura Tingle from the 'Financial Review', Mr Rudd. The Labor Party  tends to take on a bit of a character of its leader, and I suppose I would like you to  tell us what sort of Labor Party you'll be leading, and, in particular, what powers 

  Page 5 of 12

  will the caucus have if you are Prime Minister? Will it have any powers to elect  people into various positions, and particularly what role would Labor have in trying  to re-establish the rights of the Senate. I am not talking about negotiations on  Labor legislation, but some of the rights of the Senate to investigate and inquire  and generally look at broader range of issues?  

  RUDD: Just getting the triple bunger down so I don't forget. Character - well,  people can make their own judgments about all of that. I just think it's important to  be straight up and down and fair dinkum with people. I’ve said at other forums, tell  the public what you can do, and what you can't. The problems you can fix and the  problems that you can't fix. And be fair dinkum about a timetable for doing that  and have measurements out there so people know when you have. That's, if you  like, a hallmark I would like to see entrenched in any incoming Labor Government  if we’re elected.  

  By way of personal instinct, I have an inherent distaste for grandiose rhetorical  statements which don’t have any substantive dimension to them. I'm very much  into the business of ensuring that when we say we are going to do something  about homelessness, for example and I have been to a number of homeless  shelters recently, that quantitatively we come to grips with the number of people  who are sleeping rough on an evening - the actual undersupply when it comes to  emergency housing and the undersupply of secondary housing to which those  people go once they are out of the centre. How do we fill the gap, how long will it  take, what will it cost? These are the instincts I bring to bear. There is a clear cut  plan for the nation's future, but I believe any plan is not worth the paper it's written  on unless you are serious about the mechanics of its implementation and  measure that. So for me that's really important.  

  The second point you say is the powers of the parliamentary party. I have said  quite clearly in a departure from I think about 100 years of settled Labor history,  that if we win this election, that I will be appointing Labor's ministry. I will do that.  When it comes to the role of the parliamentary party, I believe it's appropriate for  the parliamentary party to have its say when it comes to the range of  parliamentary positions, for example, committee chairpersonships and the rest. I  think that’s entirely appropriate.  

  The final question that you asked was one of the role of the Senate and Senate  committees.  

  I think there's been a bit of a cancer at work in recent years, and I go back  particularly to that disgraceful saga called Kids Overboard. I think there is a  challenge for us all to make sure that we have proper processes of external  accountability. I know it's very easy to say from opposition, because you are not in  government and then when the heat is on you, it all seems different.  

  But you know if you’re running a decent government you shouldn't fear these  things. I think the Australian public are mindful that when mistakes are made, as  long as you are upfront about it and tell people that things have been done  wrongly, that's OK. This culture of secrecy, most recently reflected in this 

  Page 6 of 12

  extraordinary decision to suppress this document concerning the Government's  Work Choices options of a couple of years ago, I think says everything that's  wrong about the current Government. Therefore, consistent with what I said  before about changing FOI laws - the abolition of conclusive certificates - and  fronting up for regular Jim Middleton or post-Jim Middleton press conferences. I  think, therefore that the Senate Committee system should have a robust review  mechanism.  

  I was asked recently at a press conference about the role of ministerial staff in this  context and that's been a matter of some debate. When staff have assumed  executive responsibilities, for example in the allocation of funds under  discretionary grants programs like the Regional Partnerships Program, should  staff therefore be accountable to those sort of committees? If they have exercised  executive function, they should be.  

  JOURNALIST: Mark Riley from the Seven Network, Mr Rudd. Little surprised to  hear that you haven't thought about the consultative mechanism you’ll employ  with the ACTU. I’m pretty sure they have.  

  RUDD: I'm just being straight up and down with you mate, I haven't. I've had other  things on my mind.  

  JOURNALIST: It’s on that issue, really. You talk about the negativity of the  campaign by the Government and much of it, obviously, has been focussed on  the unions, trade unions and the union links with the front benchers in your party.  But I haven't heard you give a passionate and a strong defence of trade unionism  one would expect from a Labor leader, so here is your chance.  

  RUDD: Well yesterday, Mark, when you were here, I was actually in  Campbelltown in Western Sydney. I was there receiving from various union reps  90,000 signatures on a petition. Nurses, firies, other emergency services  personnel represented by their various organisations. I sat there in front of the  entire gallery - the travelling gallery I should say - and spoke about the importance  of petitions like that in bringing to the focus of government and the alternative  government the concerns of working families. That could only have been done  through the agency of unions.  

  Secondly, in the speech I’ve just given, I have spoken also about how can the  Government run these sort of campaigns in the face of the experiences of the  likes of Bernie Banton. I went and saw Bernie - second week of the campaign, I  think now - I went and saw him at his house. And Bernie's experience, and why I  made reference to it in my remarks today, is all about the critical work which is  done by the representatives of employees in workplaces across the country in just 

  getting some basic decency and justice.  

  Ask Bernie where he would be were it not for Greg Combet. Just ask Bernie. So  for me that just speaks volumes. It also speaks volumes about a Government  when you have, as I said before, Mr Howard's headkicker-in-chief then descends  on Bernie and have a whack at him and then only apologise afterwards when the 

  Page 7 of 12

  political heat gets too much. I think that says everything about them. It says a lot  about the likes of Bernie, and why we are proud of people who stand up for the  rights and conditions of working people and working families right across  Australia. And I met so many of them in the streets of Campbelltown yesterday.  

  DUNLEVY: Mr Rudd, Sue Dunlevy from the Daily Telegraph. Mr Rudd, your wife,  Therese, has built up a $170 million business from scratch. There can be no  question at all about her economic management skills. Of the two of you, isn't she  the one better qualified to be running the country? And if you do win the election  on Saturday, will Australians get two for the price of one as the Americans did  with the Clintons?  

  RUDD: I’ve said before on many occasions that Therese is the real success story  of this family and I am really proud of everything Therese has done with her life.  

  It's been a tough year for Therese, as many of you would know, and I'm really  proud of not just the way in which she's handled all that, but the fact that she's  built up this business.  

  I remember going with her to the Commonwealth Bank in Bris-Vegas back in  whenever it was, the 80s, late '80s, I think. And on bended knee we asked for a - I  think it was a $10,000 bank loan - thereabouts, because she had an audacious  idea to start up a business. And after a fair bit of persuasion, she got the money.  And started off in an attic office in South Brisbane, sharing half a secretary and  here we are 18 years later, and she’s worldwide employing 1200, 1400 people.  So I think she's done a fantastic job, and I'm really proud of what she's done.  

  Certainly, on the question of economic and business insights, Therese is a good  advocate of the needs of business to get out there and generate a good  performance in what is a difficult and competitive environment out there in the  private sector and I welcome the private conversations we have about that.  

  On the last part of your question, no, I'm sorry, you’re just getting me. I know that  probably disappoints you, but I'm the guy who's name is on the ballot paper and I  think, knowing my wife reasonably well - we had our 26th anniversary last week  and by the way we did go out to dinner that night - I think that's the way Therese  would prefer it as well.  

  JOURNALIST: Hi, Mr Rudd. Matthew Franklin, from The Australian. I’ve got two  questions. One, are you going to follow the lead of some state governments in  Australia, whereby they have what’s called community Cabinet meetings, that is  take your Cabinet out to meet real people and keep in touch that way?  

  Secondly I'm interested to know how you’re going to manage expectations within  the Labour Party, and within the union movement. You’ve described yourself as  conservative, you’re certainly socially conservative - my observation. Some Labor  governments in the past, particularly the Goss Government which you worked for,  had a lot of problems dealing with the left of the party when they presented  strongly conservative policy. And then they were sort of steamrolled by the  expectations of the party and also you may have the same problem with trade 

  Page 8 of 12

  unions. I wonder how you are going to manage that and whether you have a  political base which is strong enough to keep that at bay?  

  RUDD: Let me take the second question first and then I'll come back to Cabinet  out there in the regions. If I'm elected as the country's next Prime Minister, I am  absolutely determined to govern in the national interest, and in nobody's sectional  interest, and that's the way it will be if we are elected. There will always be  vigorous debates with any political party and there certainly is within ours. But you  know something? The old classical divide between left, right; Callithumpian, non-Callithumpian, I actually don't think they apply in contemporary politics.  

  If you go to the substance of our agenda. When I gave a speech, for example, in  this town on the 40th anniversary of the 1967 referendum, I draw your attention to  the content of that speech about a commitment to close the gap in terms of  Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal life expectancy; Aboriginal mortality of children  under five and also in terms of literacy and education levels. That is a  fundamental program for reform embodied in the goals set in that speech. And  you know something? If we’re elected, we intend to implement that. And, I am  confident that the party, if we form government, will be in there right behind the  implementation of those sort of programs.  

  Secondly, I have also said that part of our responsibility as a wealthy country in  the world is what we do for the rest of the world in poverty and underdevelopment.  The commitment we’ve made in terms of 0.5 per cent of GNI is a big commitment  by 2015, but it’s driven by my concern and the party’s concern that this country  can do better in its contribution to just improving the decency and the lot of others.  It's also in our national self-interest to do so because of the radical problems of  underdevelopment across Melanesia where we face real problems in terms of  long term security as well.  

  I'm confident the program we put forward is a substantive reformist program, and  I'm confident that the members of our party, in all their diversity, will be in there  behind the implementation of that program. Because for all our faults, the Labor  Party is about decency, and we want to ensure that decency is applied to  workplaces and also those people who are finding it hard to make ends meet at  home and abroad.  

  On country Cabinets, sorry I missed your other point. I've said when I have been  on the road, I think a big problem - and I say this with the secretaries of Finance  and PM and C here present - if we form the next government of the country  everyone needs to get their skates on because we going to be out there.  

  Part of it, and I speak here as some one who has formerly been a public servant  in Canberra albeit in the Department of Foreign Affairs, it is very easy for the  public service to become disconnected from Australian realities, not because  public servants are insensitive it’s just because of where we are here, in  Canberra. I have been part of that myself in the past and I think it is very good  therefore for the Cabinet, backed by the senior mandarins, to be out there in  regional Australia on a rolling basis. And again, my colleagues may be horrified to 

  Page 9 of 12

  hear this but what I have in the back of my mind is for us to be doing that on a  monthly basis. Because I think it is really important to keep in touch and my  experience of that in Queensland State Government is that it is a very good way  to keep in touch. It will horrify many public servants and quite a number of would-be ministers but I think it is a good way to be in touch. Huge wealth-generating  parts of the country in the West, in Queensland never get to see Cabinet in town.  We should. The indigenous communities, they need to see Cabinet in town as  well, that is what I want to see happen - if we win.  

  JOURNALIST: Maria Hawthorne from Australian Associated Press. Last night  John Howard warned undecided voters that electing a Kevin Rudd Government  wasn’t like getting an unwanted Christmas present - that they could not just take it  back on Boxing Day. So in that festive mood, you’ve spelled out today a list of  things that you want to see in place by 2010. What can voters expect to see in  place by Christmas next year from a Rudd Government?  

  RUDD: If we’re elected I want an incoming Labor Government to hit the ground  running. It’s why I’ve said in response to many questions that I am not attracted to  any large-scale machinery changes in the public service. I think the public service  otherwise can turn in on itself as you go through cartwheels of administrative and  sub-administrative reform.  

  Similarly on personnel questions, I am very much wedded to the restoration of  Westminster and that means the restoration of a continuing independent public  service.  

  There is another reason for all of that which is to make sure that when it comes to  the policy program of an incoming Labor Government, if we are elected, we can  get on with it quickly because it’s important that we do that.  

  Going through the measures. One, as I've already indicated, we would proceed  with early ratification of Kyoto. I’d be attending Bali. Therefore we would have by  mid-year, on top of that, the basis for us determining interim targets for an  emissions trading regime and I think that’s absolutely essential. And furthermore,  we would have in force by year's ends a uniform mandatory renewable energy  target. Because at present if you speak to the renewable energy sector there is  great concern about the disparate systems across the various States and  Territories. That needs to be brought together around Labor’s proposed national  target of 20 per cent by 2020. That is number one.  

  The education revolution, I want to get the roll out of broadband, get the roll out of  computers in schools started. That means that ‘08 would be spent on a complex  and very expensive national tendering process. We would have to get that right.  There is a large allocation of public funds, it’s $1 billion plus, therefore you have to  get your tender specifications right. Because when this roll out occurs you’ve got  to have a replacement cycle for computers in schools, you’ve got to have a  maintenance program for computers in schools and you’ve got to have a system  which can therefore handle rolling repairs. And that would have to be built into a)  tender arrangements for such an expensive piece of public money; and b) the 

  Page 10 of 12

  cooperative arrangements you fashion with the states.  

  Thirdly, by year's end, you would have a pretty clear idea about whether we’re  going to have a cooperative or a less than cooperative agreement with the States  and Territories in what I’m proposing on health and hospitals. Now that’s going to  be very interesting and perhaps colourful negotiations if we win but it is really  important.  

  I have said by mid-term which is the middle of ‘09 we would make a decision  about whether we can achieve the policy objectives we have set for the reform of  the health and hospitals system cooperatively or failing that then proceed to frame  a question to take to the Australian people about the Commonwealth taking over  long-term funding.  

  COAG therefore, I would propose be convened within the first 100 days if we are  elected to form the next government. That would form a very large part of the  agenda. It is an enormously complex area of work and you would be looking at  identifying five to six key performance indicators which State and Territory  systems would have to sign up to, vis-a-vis bringing down elective surgery waiting  lists, what happens in accident and emergency et cetera before you would then  finally frame your long-term arrangement for the States. And frankly that’s a fairly  big slice of work.  

  JOURNALIST: Mr Rudd, Andrew Fraser, Canberra Times. Mark Latham spoke  passionately about the reintroduction of a Commonwealth dental scheme. That’s  something that you’ve embraced wholeheartedly. Kim Beazley often spoke of his  grand desire to be education prime minister. As evidenced again today, you’ve  accepted that or appropriated that mantra in its entirety. Why should voters be  attracted to you on Saturday when they see so many similarities, both in policy  and in philosophy, to the two men who lost Labor the last three elections?  

  RUDD: I have no intention whatsoever of commenting on the past. I’ve put out  there a plan for the future. I'm positive about the future. I think we can take this  great country and make it even better. That’s what I am on about.  

  But the content of the plans I think speaks for itself. It’s not something we have  pulled out of our - I was going to say ear, but I won't say that now - pulled out of  the air, that is what I meant to say. Oh dear.  

  It’s not something we’ve pulled out of the air on the eve of an election. We have  been at this all year. And this education revolution platform, with chapter after  chapter, it’s an exciting platform. I do not believe Labor in the past has actually  articulated one set of policies after another from when you’ve got kids in childcare  through to early childhood education for 4-year-olds through the teaching of  maths, science, Asian languages within schools, computers in schools, an  education tax refund, doubling the number of undergraduate and postgraduate  scholarships and making sure that we’ve got state of the art trades training  centres in each one of our nation’s 2,650 our secondary schools.  

  These are all very substantive, tangible, measurable commitments and I’ll be held 

  Page 11 of 12

  accountable for that and the same applies to what we have said in terms of  health, including our proposal within that for measurable standards on the delivery  of public dental programs for all those Australians out there who need to get their  teeth fixed. It is just obscene what’s happening out there at the moment.  

  I therefore believe that the Australian people are a very practical people. If they  look at an alternative Prime Minister and say is he being fair dinkum about his  plans across these four to five key areas and they have all got measurable  timelines and commitments, then I believe they will respond to those plans  positively.  

  I am passionate about the country's future. I believe we can be much, much  better. But the overall and overriding passion I've got is, I don’t want to see this  country continue to fall behind in terms of the international batting averages, the  international league table of education investment and performance.  

  If we do that, every bit of travel I've done and work that I have done across East  Asia and China over the years tells me this - that there would be no secure future  for Australia's economy unless we radically reinvest in education, skills and 

  training through the program I describe as an education revolution. That’s my plan  for the future. Mr Howard and his Government seem very much lost in the past.  Thank you very much.
