 A research report on the problems experienced by child refugees  without parents in Australia was launched in Sydney today by the  Minister for Social Security, Senator Don Grimes.

 The report "Surviving without Parents - Indo-Chinese Minors in  New South Wales" vfras prepared by Careforce, the welfare agency of  the Sydney Anglican Home Mission.

 Launching the report at the Fairfield Council Chambers in Sydney,  Senator Grimes said it was estimated that there were some 2,800  Indo-Chinese refugee children without parents in Australia at the  present time. '

 The children, most of whom came to Australia from refugee camps,   entered Australia either as wards of the Minister for Immigration, or  to join relatives other than parents living in Australia.

 Senator Grimes said the report dealt in detail with the special  needs of these children, including arrangements for their care,  education, housing and supervision.

 He said the Federal Government was aware of the special needs of  refugee children, and had itself established a working party to  report on the care, services and legal position of this group. Senator Grimes said the findings of the Careforce report would  provide an added basis for major Commonwealth initiatives now  being developedÂ·to help young refugees resettle in Australia.

 He said the Department of Social Security had also produced an  English-Vietnamese Glossary on Social Security and Welfare to  help refugees recieve the assistance to which they were entitled  as Australian citizens.

 The Careforce report was funded by a grant of $10,000 from the  Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, and was commissioned  by the Fairfield Refugee Youth Inter-Agency.
