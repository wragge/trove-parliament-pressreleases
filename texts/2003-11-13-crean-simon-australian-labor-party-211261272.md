 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION   

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - LONDON  

 THURSDAY 13 NOVEMBER 2003 

 

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:  UK-Aust Leadership Dialogue; trade; Iraq;  Guantanamo detainees; Mr Brigitte; Memorial; UK Question Time;  Asylum seekers;    

 

 The dialogue forum that has just concluded was a very useful opportunity and  it has potential, some important potential, if properly used. We don’t need to  meet to reaffirm our common values. But I think that what the forum did was  to give us the opportunity to use those common values to,in my view, to be  the basis on which we can build the bridge in our region to the adaptation of  those values.    

 And also given the threats of terrorism and the issues of economic  development in a globalised context, give more emphasis to our regional  focus. I think we have been missing out at the regional level. The focus just  on the American relationship and the UK relationship has seen us excluded  from the important leadership dialogue tables being established in Asia.    

 And why is Asia important to us? Because it contains seven of our top ten  markets. Now, it’s not just economic liberalisation opening up opportunities,  it’s also how we handle the threat of terror, how we handle the issue of  asylum seekers. So both security and economic development are  fundamentally important for us to engage the region more effectively. I think  that this dialogue provides a golden opportunity to use the strength of the UK  relationship to advance our interests in the region, but to provide a bridge  through Australia to Asia. I argue that not just in terms of our relationship  with the UK, but also with the US.    

 JOURNALIST:  Mr Howard said this morning, he made a great point of  saying that our ties with the region are very strong. We’ve just had a visit in  Australia from President Hu, we’ve had a new free trade agreement with 

 Thailand. On what basis do you say that we have, if not ignored, not paid  enough attention to the relationship?    

 CREAN:  Look, I don’t think the bilateral arrangements - as  important as they are - are an effective substitute for us being involved in the  leadership forums that are emerging in the Asian region. Now, look back to 

 when APEC was formed - which Australia drove - the creation of APEC. It  went out of its way to get the Americans involved and make it a useful forum.  But since that time, over the last decade there have been new leadership  structures formed. The ASEAN plus groupings. Japan and China have both  sought the opportunity to develop their vision through ASEAN, but not  Australia. Australia has been excluded. I happen to believe that there is a  golden opportunity for us with the change in leadership in Malaysia to really  confront this issue again. And Australia simply has to be at those leadership  tables. It’s how we got trade liberalisation in the region. The Bogor  Declaration off the back of the formation of APEC, off the back of the Uruguay  round, off the back of the Cairns group. This is how Australia has to position  itself and advance ourselves in our national interests. And there is no point  simply coming up here and reaffirming the strength of our ties with the Brits.  It’s nice to do that, but unless we understand what our relationship is within  the region and pursue, it we are missing out on a golden opportunity.    

 JOURNALIST:  ….[inaudible]…the Howard Government has rightly pointed  to an enormous increase in trade…[inaudible]    

 CREAN:  And so we should. Because that’s where the huge market  opportunities are coming from. I mean, we talk about a free trade agreement  with the United States almost as an obsession. And yet all we’ve done is  agreed to talk about it with China. That’s all we’ve done. You talk about the  visit from President Hu Jintao- what, an agreement to talk further about a  trade agreement?    

 JOURNALIST:  [inaudible]…our trade with China has increased 200% over  the last few years?    

 CREAN:  I would hope it would. Look at China’s trade with the rest  of the world. Look at the size of the Chinese market. China is our opportunity  and there is a well of good will to Australia from China. Why? Because the 

 Whitlam government opened up relations with China in a ground breaking  way. So it’s the culture of the Chinese not to forget that. Now I’m saying that  the Government should be more proactive, should be building the relationship  more effectively. Not just country to country but in the regional dialogue.    

 JOURNALIST:  [inaudible]…ASEAN?    

 CREAN:  I think that’s an important step.  

 

 JOURNALIST:  Is there anything else …[inaudible] 

 

 CREAN:  It should be using that to drive the issues of trade  liberalisation, of regional security and a regional solution to border protection.    

 JOURNALIST:  Did you discuss Iraq and the US relationship?     

 CREAN:  Yes I did, I discussed it with him, I discussed it with the  Foreign Secretary and I’ve had the opportunity to discuss it with a number of  the other ministers that I’ve met whilst I’ve been here, the defence minister.    

 JOURNALIST:  [inaudible]…military personnel… in light of the terror  campaigns being run…?   

 CREAN:   Well, let me answer it this way. I think it’s time to  understand that a new approach to securing the peace is needed. The  alliance went in with a plan to win a war but not to secure the peace. And  increasingly there is acceptance that the ability of the occupying forces alone  to secure that peace is not going to be enough. The fact that there has been  a further resolution of the United Nations is welcome. But, in all of the  discussions that I’ve had here there’s the realisation that the sooner self  government and a governing capacity is given to the Iraqis- is developed and  handed over to the Iraqis-the better for everyone.    

 JOURNALIST:  But until then, what approach would you like to see in  Iraq?    

 CREAN:  There has to be a greater commitment to involving the  United Nations in securing the peace.    

 JOURNALIST:  Peacekeepers? And would that involve Australian  peacekeepers?    

 CREAN:   I think Australia has obviously made an important  contribution to date. I’m not arguing for additional involvement of Australian  personnel. I’m arguing for a greater involvement by the UN and the spreading  of the commitment to securing the peace in Iraq.   

 

 JOURNALIST:  How would you define the presence of Australian troops in  Iraq. The Prime Minister is saying that it’s not a peacekeeping  mission…[inaudible]…the Prime Minister said we’re going to remain there for  some time yet.   

 

 CREAN:  Our presence there is the inevitable consequence of being  one of the occupying forces. And our obligation under international  conventions to be responsible for law and order. Now, this is something I’m  convinced Australia hadn’t thought through. But be that as it may, it is  something that needs to be. If we’re to extricate ourselves from that,the only  way to do it is to get the UN involvement in the peace solution for Iraq.  

 

 JOURNALIST:  Why can’t people say peacekeeping in Iraq? Is it not that?    

 CREAN:  Well, no, because I think it is more than peace keeping.  Basically you’re having to deal with terrorism. This after all was an alliance  sent in to stop the spread of terrorism. What it seems to have done is to  create a magnet for terrorists. And it’s the American servicemen in particular 

 who are the targets of that. And that’s terribly unfortunate.     

 JOURNALIST:  [inaudible]…greater UN involvement…?    

 CREAN:  Well I didn’t have to because he,and you heard his speech,  I saw him after his speech on Monday night. His speech on Monday night  acknowledged that point, and so the discussion… 

 

 [tape break]    

 …important for me to understand his thinking. But they are convinced about  the need to try and move more quickly to a peaceful self governing operation  in Iraq as best that can be achieved.    

 JOURNALIST:  So do you think there is a change in the US position on  that timetable? That they are more convinced…[inaudible]…more quickly  ahead of those UN talks?  

 

 CREAN:  Well again, just going back to the discussions that I had  with President Bush when he was here and what he had to say publicly and  the fact that they’d been through and got the UN resolution through. The  latest resolution through I think is an indication that they would like to see it  move more quickly too.    

 JOURNALIST:  Guantanamo detainees…are you convinced the  Government is doing enough to pressure the United States to get the facts  together…?    

 CREAN:  Well, if they are doing enough it’s not demonstrating itself  as successful. They tell me they are doing enough. In the forum today they  argued that they were putting the pressure on. I raised it with President Bush  when he was here, as you are aware the Prime Minister did. But I mean, it’s a  simple proposition from our point of view. They should be ideally brought  home to face justice. If there is a problem with that because of our legal  ability let’s hear the Government argue that point. Or else, have them brought  to justice in accordance with American Law. And now that the indication is  made that they will appeal rights I think that’s an important development.  The sooner they are brought to justice the better and that’s something the  Government must continue to pressure to achieve.    

 JOURNALIST:  [inaudible]  

 

 CREAN:  I haven’t heard what he said, all I’m saying is we should be  arguing it, so they are brought to face justice here under our system.    

 JOURNALIST:  What Mr Howard said was that there is no international  exchange or automatic repatriation rights….there’s no sense that they should  hand those people over to the country of origin.    

 CREAN:  Well they did with Mr Brigitte. And now it seems we’re  looking to bring him back. Now, we handed over Mr Brigitte without any  assessment as to whether, it would seem, the person could be tried here. We  were told that there were deficiencies in our legislation. In fact we were told  that the powers didn’t exist under our legislation. And then it became a moot  point twenty-four hours later under parliamentary questioning. If the latest  reports are true that the French indeed, can’t detain this person under their  laws it makes a bit of a mockery of the assertion by which it was argued they  should be returned so quickly. But, I’m only going on reports on that basis. I’ll  have to wait till I get back to get an update on the status of that.    

 JOURNALIST:  The Prime Minister…relationship between the United  Kingdom and France…[inaudible]?    

 CREAN:  It doesn’t at all. I think it is important. I start from this  point, Paul, the relationship that we’re talking about is as strong as it is  because it’s bi-partisan. And I would expect the Prime Ministers of both  countries to talk constructively on matters of mutual interest. Clearly, the fact  that there has been support by both of these Prime Ministers for the war on  Iraq has produced a particular bond. Because in different contexts, different 

 circumstances that decision has been criticised in both countries. So I would  expect that people that had made the commitment together would be openly  supportive of demonstrating why that decision taken was the correct one and  why they were well disposed towards each other.    

 But, I had a very friendly discussion with Mr Blair. The access to the  government and its ministers, I’ve had no difficulty achieving as I haven’t in  terms of Washington. Now, whilst we will have political differences - and  governments and oppositions often have political differences - the fact is the  strength of the relationship is built through common values, commitment to  values of freedom, justice, democracy, the rule of law, all of those things  which all sides of politics in both countries agree on. So it doesn’t surprise me  one bit.    

 JOURNALIST:  What’s your personal impression of the war memorial?    

 CREAN:  I like the war memorial. I must say I wandered down  there, I was walking back on Saturday after I had been to the Walkabout.    

 JOURNALIST:  [inaudible] 

 

 CREAN:  No, no, I just had to try and stay awake. But I walked  down past it and ran into a group of Aussies and it was in its sort of  unfinished state and on the Saturday I wasn’t that impressed by it. It wasn’t  finished and it didn’t have the water flowing over it. But I think it’s a lovely  memorial and I think its location and the preparedness of the government to  make that location available is a tribute to the strength of the relationship  with Australia. It’s not only a central location it’s in an ideal location really. It’s  where many people will visit and they’ll think about it.    

 I think the memorial is one that encourages reflection, it encourages people  to actually stop and spend time on the detail. None of the names of those  towns are in alphabetical order so if you’re looking for one amongst 24,000  expect a fair time to get there. But that’s a good thing. The other interesting  thing is how quiet it is when you’re down there in the cul-de-sac, so to speak.  So, the other interesting thing I thought was speaking to the veterans the  night before, how, open they were in telling their stories. They were  fascinating to spend hours with, how choked with emotion they were when  they stood in front of it.  

 

 If it affects that combination of contemplation and emotion and thought and  grieving, then I think it is a tribute to all of those involved with it.    

 JOURNALIST:  [inaudible]   

 CREAN:  I must say, when the water turned on too and flowed over  it, I think that gives it an additional relief which I think is quite stunning.    

 JOURNALIST:  [inaudible]…Question Time today…?    

 CREAN:  Well what I did like was seeing Howard in opposition. And I  thought to myself that look, there was a bit more grace in their Question  Time than perhaps there is in ours. They get through a lot more questions,  they allow the supplementaries and the Speaker seemed pretty well in  charge. But nevertheless it was pretty apparent that both sides have practised 

 their lines.    

 JOURNALIST:  [inaudible]   

 CREAN:  I think it depends what you seek to achieve through the  Chair of the Party. In fact, I’ve just come from speaking with the Chair of the  British Labour Party, Ian McCartney and his is a coordinating role for 

 devolution and consultation. It’s more of an activist campaign function. I took  the view with the change of the rules of the Party that what we had to do  was to give the rank and file a say and have a stronger connection, if you  like, between the executive of the Party and its membership.    

 So, we’ve got our own version of Co-Chair because we’ll have three of them  in the next couple of days. I’m not too sure when it actually will be declared.  But, I’m delighted with the numbers that have turned out to vote. It is, from  all accounts, the biggest participation by a Party membership in a vote in our  history. And I think that that does vindicate the decision to actually open the  show up.    

 I think that parties have to be more connected, they have to be in touch with  their constituency and the constituency in touch with their communities. I’ve  argued before, you’ve probably heard me say that I want candidates standing  for the Labor Party who don’t just carry the Labor Party ticket, they’ve got to  be champions for their community. I’ve always believed in the local  campaigning focus.    

 That’s how we’ve been running the Medicare campaign. It is taking the bulk  billing rates, it is taking the lack of service be it GPs or in hospitals and  saying, `how can we make this better’? We understand your problem and  we’ve got a solution for it. The policy solution in terms of what we determine  is the policy, but then its application at the local level. And I want the  membership of the Labor Party through its elected representatives out there  actively campaigning in their faces. That’s why it’s very useful to talk with the  British Labour Party about some of the campaigning techniques that they use.    

 JOURNALIST:  …[inaudible]…   

 CREAN:  If we don’t get the answers, Mark, of course we have to  use the parliamentary process to get them out. But look, I just find this  incredible. On the day that this boat arrived the Government rushed through  some retrospective excision of 3,000 islands. Their view was that you protect  the nation by surrendering it. Now I think that’s a dumb solution. I’ve said  that before.    

 But the really important question is how did this boat get through? Here’s a  Government that was telling everyone they had great border protection but it  landed on Australian soil. And everyone knows Melville Island is not far from  Darwin. They got the compass wrong. What were they going to do if it landed  at Darwin? Excise that? And then they turned the boat away, refusing to  answer fundamental questions like: `did it land on Australian soil? When did  the Government first become aware it was coming in? What was the health of  people onboard?  

 

 And my question to Amanda Vanstone on the day that I had the briefing  initially with her, had these people sought asylum? The Prime Minister ignored  it in question time, Amanda Vanstone could not answer one key question that  was put to her. And indeed, in relation to one bit of information, she got it  wrong. She told me that there was only one naval vessel being deployed, the  Geelong, a patrol boat. When in fact it turned out subsequently to be two.  Now the Government simply has to come clean on this.  

 

 And I think that its not just the question of knowing the facts in this case,  how is it that the boat got through? And we know the answer to that is  because the navy has had to withdraw significant resources from the RELEX  operation. And I don’t blame them for that because they are stretched. They  are in the Solomons, they are in the Gulf. But that’s why the patrolling  operation isn’t a naval function. Navy is for defence. What we need is a cop  on the beat, we need the Coast Guard. And had we had a Coast Guard I’m  sure that surveillance would have been more effective at detection and  determination as to what the appropriate course of action would be.    

 JOURNALIST:  [inaudible] …Australia using Indonesia as an  immigration…?    

 CREAN:  No, I don’t agree with that. Because I believe in this  fundamental principle. If in fact asylum seekers come to us who are not  genuine refugees they should be returned to where they came from. Now,  the reason I believe that is because it has worked for us in the past. This is  not the first wave of boat people that Australia has experienced. We  experienced them from Vietnam and we secured return arrangements with  the Vietnamese Government. Fraser did it initially and subsequently was  bolstered by Labor. In South China there were refugees, we had an  agreement with China to return them. That’s what we should have with  Indonesia.
