 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Thursday, 31 October 2013   

 Denying family reunion forces children onto  boats   

 The Coalition should reintroduce family reunion visas for refugees and clear the current backlog of  over 20,000 family reunion applications to help reduce the number of children coming to Australia  by boat, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “We’ve seen this worrying trend before,” the Greens immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young said.   

 “When family reunion visas were axed in the past, the number of children coming by boat increased  with disastrous results.   

 “There is a direct link between the introduction of TPVs, the removal of family reunion and the  increase in children on boats.   

 “The government’s policy is irresponsible and it is putting lives at risk.   

 “We should be doing all we can to help bring children here before they take a dangerous boat  journey and reinstating family reunion visas is an essential part of that.   

 “Australia has more than a thousand children locked up in onshore detention, and still more have  been left languishing on Nauru.   

 “It is sad but true that Australia stands out in the international context because of our politicians’  refusal to care for refugees, including unaccompanied children.   

 “If this government really cared about saving lives at sea while protecting refugees, Australia would  be leading a genuine regional solution rather than a domestic demonisation campaign.”
