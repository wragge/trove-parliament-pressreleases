 Australian  support to reduce poverty in the Palestinian Territories   

 Australia  is  providing  $8  million  over  three  years  to  implement  the  Middle  East  NGO   Cooperation  Agreements  (AMENCA),  an  initiative  that  seeks  to  reduce  the  vulnerability  of   Palestinians to poverty and conflict.    

 The  NGO  Cooperation  Agreements  form  part  of  Australia's  three-year  Middle  East   Development Cooperation Strategy, which commenced in July this year.   

 It  is  designed  to  support  the  Middle  East  peace  process  by  decreasing  the  vulnerability  of   Palestinians  to  poverty  and  conflict,  strengthen  the  capacity  of  Palestinian  institutions  to   provide essential services for their people, and support peace-building efforts.   

 The aid will focus on high priority areas of development including income generation, support  for vulnerable groups including women and children, and sustainable agriculture.   

 By supporting Australian NGOs to help develop the peace-building within Palestinian society,  the Australian Government aims to maximise the impact of Australian humanitarian funding  in the Palestinian Territories.   

 Australian NGOs will be invited to submit proposals for projects that address peace-building  activities, increase self-reliance, and help in the delivery of essential services.    

 This  initiative  complements  Australia's  efforts  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  Palestinian   institutions to provide essential services, such as education, health and shelter to Palestinian  refugees.    

 Australia contributed more than $11 million in humanitarian aid for the Palestinian Territories  and  refugees  in  2003-04,  and  this  contribution  is  part  of  an  estimated  $12  million  in   Australian humanitarian assistance to support Palestinian refugees over 2004/05.   

 Australia  also  increased  annual  funding  for  international  humanitarian,  emergency  and   refugee programs by $13 million to $146 million in the May budget.
