 Senator Grant Tambling Shadow Minister for Community Services,  External Territories and Northern Australia

 Media Release DEFENCE OF THE NORTH A PRIORITY

 Defence of the north, rather than defence in the north, is the  thrust of the Federal Coalition's new defence policy, Northern  Territory Senator Grant Tambling said today.

 Senator Tambling said the policy - the most comprehensive  statement on the future of Australian defence since 1987 -  would sharpen the focus on northern Australia by:

 * Increasing spending on flying hours,  sailing days and  exercises and training for the Australian Defence Force;

 * Supporting the relocation of army forces to the north  (with the specific exception of a reduced operational  force of leopard tanks given that their life-of-type does  not extend much beyond the end of the decade);

 * Strengthening intelligence and surveillance  capabilities in the north by fast-tracking Airborne Early  Warning aircraft to compliment the Jindalee Over the  Horizon Radar System;

 * Boosting our first line of defence by giving priority  to upgrading existing air defence radar and studying the  need for additional air defence radar;

 * Providing the opportunity for United States aircraft  and naval vessels to make greater use of our facilities  and encouraging Australian-US joint ventures in research  and development and marketing of defence equipment;

 * Fast-tracking the acquisition of up to six Coastal  Minehunters to improve our minehunting and minesweeping  capability, particularly in northern ports which are  highly vulnerable to mining;

 * Devoting additional resources to updating our knowledge  of oceanographic and hydrographic conditions along the  northern coastline;

 * Managing the F/A-18 fighter aircraft to extend their  life-of-type to 2010 and supporting the modernisation of  P3C maritime surveillance aircraft;

 * Modernising the Fremantle Class patrol boat and  developing a new class of offshore patrol vessel;  . . . / 2

 * Upgrading security arrangements with Australia's  neighbours through more training and joint exercises as  well as co-operating in areas such as maritime 

 surveillance and refugee movements; and

 * Additional troop mobility and heavy lift helicopters.

 Senator Tambling said the wide-ranging policy included  initiatives to improve the welfare of Australian Defence Force  members and their families in an effort to reduce 

 dissatisfaction with service life.

 "Last month I held high-level discussions with senior military  officers at 2CRU, Shoal Bay Receiving Station, RAAF Base  Tindal and Waler Barracks, near Palmerston.

 "I was also briefed on future RAAF operations at Delamere and,  with the Defence Housing Authority, visisted HMAS Coonawarra,  RAAF Base Darwin, Larrakeyah Barracks and Palmerston Married  Quarters.

 "I am confident that a Federal Coalition Government will work  hard to develop the highest standards of training excellence  and experience in our defence force as well as ensuring combat  preparedness and capability.

 "Such a commitment can only benefit the Northern Territory."
