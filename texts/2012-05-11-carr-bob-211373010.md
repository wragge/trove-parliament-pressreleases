 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  Senator the Hon. Bob Carr  May 11, 2012    

 

 FOREIGN MINISTER CONDEMNS BOMBINGS IN DAMASCUS    

 

 Foreign Minister Bob Carr has condemned two car-bomb attacks that occurred in  Damascus on 10 May, killing more than 50 people and injuring a further 400, mostly  civilian bystanders.     

 “The ongoing loss of innocent civilian life in Syria is completely unacceptable,”  Senator Carr said.     

 “It is critical that all efforts are made to bring this spiral of violence to an immediate  end.”     

 Senator Carr reiterated Australia’s strong support for Joint Special Envoy Annan’s  six-point plan, including the cease-fire and the United Nations Supervision Mission in  Syria (UNSMIS).     

 “Mr Annan’s plan provides a critical vehicle for bringing about a resolution to this  crisis. It is in the interests of all sides to adhere to their commitments under the plan  if it is to have a chance of success,” Senator Carr said.    

 “The Syrian Government must meet the terms of the agreement to withdraw troops  from, and cease attacks on, populated centres.”    

 Senator Carr expressed his deep sympathy for the victims of the attacks and their  families. He also acknowledged the suffering of refugees and displaced persons  after more than a year of turmoil in Syria.
