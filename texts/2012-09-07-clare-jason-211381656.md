 MEDIA RELEASE 

 Asylum seekers assisted north-west of Cocos Islands 

 06 September 2012 

 

 The Australian Maritime Safety Authority Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC  Australia) has coordinated a search and rescue operation of a vessel requiring  assistance north-west of Cocos (Keeling) Islands overnight.    

 The location of the vessel was confirmed by a RAAF Maritime Patrol aircraft under  the coordination of AMSA.   

 Merchant vessel TW Manila arrived at the location at approximately 1pm AEST  yesterday (5 September 2012).   

 63 passengers were embarked and TW Manila arrived at Cocos (Keeling) Islands  this morning where the people were transferred to Australian Government  authorities.   

 The Department of Immigration and Citizenship will now make arrangements for  them to be transferred to Christmas Island, where they will undergo initial security,  health and identity checks and their reasons for travel will be established.   

 People arriving by boat without a visa after 13 August 2012 run the risk of transfer to  a regional processing country.
