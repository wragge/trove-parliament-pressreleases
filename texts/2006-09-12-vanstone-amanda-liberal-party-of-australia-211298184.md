  Media Release  Senator the Hon Amanda Vanstone  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

  204.06 Tuesday 12 September 2006 

  Continued Improvement on 90-day Protection Commitment 

  As promised, both the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) and the  Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) continue to process more Protection Visa applications  within the 90-day time limit. 

  The third statutory report by DlMA on Protection Visa Processing Taking More than 90  Days for the Reporting Period 01 March to 30 June 2006, was tabled in Parliament today,  together with the RRT‘s Third Report on the Conduct of Reviews Not Completed Within 90  Days for the Reporting Period 01 March to 30 June 2006. 

  “The DlMA report shows my department has successfully continued to clear applications  for further protection visas and reduce its processing times for people applying for  protection for the first time, in accordance with the Government’s commitment of June 17  last year,” Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, said. 

  “Of the 781 applications decided in more than 90 days, 691 of those were delayed for  reasons outside the department’s control. 

  “Of the 391 applications that were over 90 days and still undecided, 364 were attributed to  factors outside the department’s control. The total number of applications not finalised in  90 days is a significant reduction from previous reports.” 

  The RRT report indicates a significant reduction of reviews being finalised outside the 90-  day requirement. According to the report, 76 per cent of the 712 reviews being finalised in  the reporting period were completed within the required timeframe. 

  “The tribunal has made significant progress in bringing down the number of applications  older than 90 days - only 54 applications were older than 90 days at the end of the  reporting period, down from 80 active cases at 12 April this year,” Senator Vanstone said. 

  “This reduction is because of the virtual elimination of a significant backlog and provides a  way forward to speedier reviews. 

  “Completing the processing and review of protection visa decisions in a timely manner is  clearly beneficial to applicants and in line with the Government’s commitment to greater  efficiency.”
