 Ombudsman's Reports Again Demonstrate the Need for Mandatory  Detention to be Scrapped

 Australian Democrats Deputy Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett has renewed his party's long standing call for  mandatory detention to be removed from the Migration Act. 

 Senator Bartlett was speaking following the tabling in the Senate of further reports from the Ombudsman on  people who have been subjected to long-term detention.

 Senator Bartlett also welcomed Minister Vanstone' acknowledgement of DIMA's ineptitude, as part of her  response to the reports.

 "Change within DIMA will take more than better staff training, up to date IT systems and openness, although  these are essential steps, and while I give credit to the Minister for admitting the inherent problems within  DIMA, these reports conclusively demonstrate that permanent positive change can only occur by changing  the Migration Act itself."

 "Two difficult cases tabled today detailed stories of people who were detained for up to four years as a  consequence of not being able to be identified. They are a reminder that Cornelia Rau's case was not unique.  As long as mandatory detention remains the law, the chances of this sort of injustice reoccurring will always  remain much higher."

 "The Democrats initiated Senate inquiry into the operation of the Migration Act will be tabling its report in the  Senate tomorrow; it will undoubtedly reinforce the case that legislative change is essential if cultural change  in the immigration area is to be genuine," concluded Senator Bartlett.
