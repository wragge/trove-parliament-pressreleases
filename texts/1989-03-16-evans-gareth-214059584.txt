 Australian aid for repatriation of Namibian refugees

 Australia will provide $500,000 for the repatriation of Namibian refugees,  the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Michael Duffy,  announced today.

 Approximately 58,000 Namibian refugees are to be repatriated following a  tripartite peace agreement signed late last year by Angola, Cuba and South  Africa. Most of the refugees are in Angola.

 "Australia's contribution is in response to an appeal from the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for its Namibia Repatriation  Operation," Mr Duffy said. '

 Mr Duffy noted that the UNHCR operation would cover food, transport,  health, shelter and rehabilitation. The operation is scheduled to take place  in M ay/June this year.

 "This contribution is in addition to Australia’s participation in the UN  « peacekeeping force, to which we are providing 300 military personnel," Mr  Duffy commented.

 Australian emergency assistance to Namibian refugees forms part of the  Government's humanitarian aid program administered by the Australian  International Development Assistance Bureau (A1DAB), Canberra.
