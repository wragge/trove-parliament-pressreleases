 Shadow Defence Minister David Johnston 

 Labor's defence cuts now on global stage  

 18/07/12  

 The Opposition’s criticism and alarm following the drastic cuts to the Defence Budget  has been endorsed by former US Deputy Secretary of State, Richard Armitage. 

 In the May Budget Labor drained $5.5 billion out of Defence and reduced its annual  funding to the lowest level as a proportion of GDP to levels not seen since 1938,  effectively hollowing out our Defence forces. 

 Shadow Defence Minister David Johnston said Richard Armitage’s comments were a  significant criticism and a timely warning from a defence and national security expert  with a wealth of knowledge and experience. 

 “The Prime Minister and the Defence Minister need to take heed of his criticism, and  accept his advice that you can’t treat Defence as an ATM to prop up a phoney  budget surplus for short term political gain without any consequences,” Senator  Johnston said. 

 “The Defence Minister cancelled or deferred most defence projects without providing  an operational or strategic justification - it was only ever about the money.” 

 “The Army has a high operational tempo with active deployment in Afghanistan while  the Navy is dealing with a daily influx of asylum seekers off our northern coastline,  and it is during this exceptional period that Labor decides that Defence is the only  portfolio to stump up money for the Budget.” 

 “The Defence Minister has delivered a Defence portfolio that is essentially an  unsustainable mess that will take at least a decade to fix.” 

 “The superficially expedient nature of these cuts means Australia is left without a  credible defence administrative or strategic plan, and now one of our oldest allies is  openly voicing concern about the situation Labor has put us in.”  

 Richard Armitage was reputedly one of the most highly decorated officers in the US  public service, who served in Vietnam in the US Navy and the CIA before his  appointment as deputy secretary of state under General Colin Powell and Donald  Rumsfeld in both Bush Administrations.
