  Media Release  Senator the Hon Amanda Vanstone  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

  Australia improving school curriculum for 55,000 refugee children 

  Thousands of internally displaced children in Thailand will have the chance to receive a  better education thanks to a $500,000 Australian Government donation, the Minister for  Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, announced today. 

  Senator Vanstone made the announcement while touring the Mae La camp in Thailand,  which shelters mainly Burmese and Karen displaced persons. 

  “The donation testifies to the Australian Government’s commitment to helping the most  vulnerable in our region,” Senator Vanstone said. 

  “Of the 140,000 people in refugee camps in Thailand, there are an estimated 55,000  children, many of whom are without parents or carers. 

  “This education project will assist in the training of 1400 teachers, provide new curriculum  development, expand access of quality psychosocial support for children and upgrade  facilities to ensure a safe and friendly environment in the refugee camps along the Thai-  Burma border. 

  “Australia can then help some of these children to resettle in Australia under our  Humanitarian Programme . 

  “About 13,000 refugee and humanitarian entrants most in need of resettlement will start a  new life in Australia under the programme in 2005-06.” 

  The education project was set up by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to  strengthen protection measures and improve the education opportunities of displaced  children in Thailand. 

  Armed conflict and its aftermath have resulted in 140,000 people fleeing conflict in Burma  to refugee camps in Thailand, with a further estimated 100,000 refugees without access to  refugee camps along the Thai-Burma border. 

  Due to this displacement, children have limited access to basic social services such as  health care, clean water, safe sanitation and education. Many are vulnerable to disease or  death and exposed to the risk of trafficking, abuse and sexual exploitation. 

  By helping children in the schools, UNICEF can quickly identify those who are in special  need of assistance and, if necessary, refer them to countries such as Australia for  resettlement.
