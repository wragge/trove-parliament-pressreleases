 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/784 SUNDAY 22 AUGUST 2004   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS & SPOKESPERSON ON DEFENCE  Aus Parliament should decide on China and Taiwan stance The Australian Parliament is where any decision should be made about our involvement in any war, the Australian Democrats said today. "The decision to go to war should not be in the hands of the Prime Minister or the Foreign Affairs Minister, particularly with the current incumbents who, respectively, can’t be trusted to tell the truth or to know when to shut up,” said Democrats leader Senator Andrew Bartlett.  Former Minister Gareth Evans has said "In foreign policy, words are like bullets." "Alexander Downer has a mouth like an AK-47," said Senator Andrew Bartlett. "The Democrats have long been defenders of Taiwan’s desire for self-determination, the importance of the security relationship with the US and our economic relationship with both the US and China, but we believe it is the Parliament’s role to decide what is in the best interests of Australia and the region.  "Australia’s relationship with the US should not be the determinant of every foreign affairs, trade or security issue. Nowhere is it written in ANZUS that we have to follow the US into every ill-conceived war." The Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, has already moved to reassure the United States that Australia would come to its aid, if it becomes involved in a conflict. Concern about a Chinese military strike against the US-shielded Taiwan has sharpened drastically since the island's independence-leaning President, Chen Shui-bian, gained a new term in the March elections and foreshadowed changes to its constitution. The Democrats have campaigned for over 20 years to have the power to send Australia to war taken out of the hands of the Prime Minister and given to the Parliament. See the Democrats Truth about War mini movie, called “How to stop the next war” at www.democrats.org.au. Tens of thousands of Australians have seen this internet clip, as well as the Democrats “Truth Overboard” mini movie about Government’s asylum seekers policy leading up to and since the 2001 election.   MEDIA ALERT What: Senator Andrew Bartlett will be available to comment  When: 1.15pm Sunday 22 August Where:  Nundah State School Oval, Boyd St (between Park Rd and Bage St) QLD Media Contact - Daele Healy - 0419 867 649
