 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 05/046 SATURDAY 5 FEBRUARY 2005   SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS SPOKESPERSON ON IMMIGRATION  ASYLUM SEEKERS SAVED AUSTRALIAN WOMAN FROM INDEFINITE IMPRISONMENT INDEPENDENT INQUIRY ESSENTIAL Parliament's most regular visitor to detention centres says a fully independent inquiry is essential into how the Immigration Department imprisoned a mentally ill Australian women in isolation. Australian Democrats Deputy Leader and immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, who visited the Baxter detention centre this week, said the woman, Cornelia Rau, would still be in detention if it wasn't for asylum seekers urging their friends in the community to help her. "There are serious questions about whether the detention of this woman was lawful, particularly given that she was clearly mentally ill, yet was kept in isolation rather than taken to mental health facility,” Senator Bartlett said. "I have visited Baxter many times, along with every other current Australian detention centre, including Christmas Island and Nauru. They are clearly not a place to imprison a mentally ill person. These places create and exacerbate mental illness. “Both the Immigration Department and the centre management (GSL) failed to respond to my requests to meet with them while I was visiting the Baxter detention centre last Tuesday, despite my giving plenty of notice.   "Their unwillingness to meet with me meant they did not have to answer questions about the case of the German-speaking woman. This is a symptom of the dangerous arrogance of this Government about how it treats people in detention. “I will be questioning the Minister and Immigration officials over this issue when the Parliament returns next week and in Estimates the week following. "The federal Government has total control over the lives of people in detention and is able to operate with a level of secrecy and exemption from legal protections, that no Australian prison is allowed." "Unless this incident is properly investigated by an independent body, anyone who is mentally ill or who speaks a different language will have strong reason to feel at risk of losing their freedom and being subjected to treatment such as imprisonment in isolation, at the hands of a Government that cannot be held accountable," Senator Bartlett concluded. Senator Bartlett is available for comment in Brisbane today. Contact  0418 743 789
