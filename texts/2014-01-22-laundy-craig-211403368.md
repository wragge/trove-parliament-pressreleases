 Creating job opportunities for new migrants and refugees 

 Wednesday 22 January 2014 Joint Media Release    

 The Hon Luke Hartsuyker MP 

 ï· Assistant Minister for Employment 

 Mr Craig Laundy MP 

 ï· Member for Reid 

 Assistant Minister for Employment Luke Hartsuyker and Federal Member for Reid Craig  Laundy today met with Auburn Diversity Services (ADSi) to discuss how employment  services can be tailored to help deliver improved outcomes for new migrants and refugees. 

 Auburn Diversity Services Inc provides crucial services to refugees, women, youth, children,  the aged and the unemployed who have recently settled in Australia and are from  disadvantaged backgrounds. 

 Mr Hartsuyker said new arrivals often needed intensive support when settling in Australia  and organisations such as ADSi delivered vital services. 

 “I was particularly interested to discuss how ADSi provides assistance in trying to secure  employment for recently arrived migrants and refugees. Getting a job is an important part of  settling into a new country and participating in the local community. 

 “I am currently consulting with stakeholders across the country about how we can deliver a  more efficient and effective employment services sector. The Australian Government is  committed to better targeting its employment programmes to job seekers and employers. 

 “It is vital that Job Services Australia Providers develop strong links with both employers and  job seekers, including refugees and migrants. Craig Laundy was very keen for me to meet 

 with ADSi and understand their challenges in finding a job for recent arrivals" Mr Hartsuyker  said. 

 Mr Laundy acknowledged the importance of the services ADSi delivered in the local  community. 

 “In many cases ADSi is the key link between new arrivals and essential services. They assist  with health, education, income support, language translation and housing. They give new  migrants a better opportunity to settle in Australia and live a productive life. 

 “We have many new migrants settling in the Reid electorate and I am committed to ensuring  local government services reflect the individual circumstances of our community,” Mr  Laundy said.
