 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Friday, 5 July 2013    

 PM needs new direction on refugee policy with  Indonesia    

 The Prime Minister Kevin Rudd should use his trip to Indonesia to usher in a new era of  cooperation between the two nations on refugee policy, the Australian Greens have said.    

 “We need to see a new, humane approach from the government, not a repeat of the Howard-era cruelty,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “The Houston Report said that Australia needs to resettle 3,800 refugees out of Indonesia as a  matter of urgency.    

 “An emergency intake of up to 10,000 people from Indonesia and the surrounding region would  give refugees a much safer pathway to Australia than a journey on a leaky boat. This would also  show that Australia is committed to helping Indonesia deal with the humanitarian crisis in our  region and not just interested in pushing people away.    

 “Australia’s relationship with Indonesia is one built on understanding and trust, but our self-centred approach to refugee policy in recent years has been at odds with that.    

 “It is also essential for Australia to abandon its ill-fated, expensive and ineffectual obsession  with deterrence.    

 “The Labor Party’s no advantage policy has been a spectacular failure. We know it and the  government knows it, so let’s get rid of it.”
