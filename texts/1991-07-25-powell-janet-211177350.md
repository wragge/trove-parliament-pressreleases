  MEDIA RELEASE SENATOR JANET POWELL LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS  PARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIA · THE SENATE 

  25 July, 1991 PR #91/337 

  POWELL WELCOMFB BUSINESS MIGRATION ANNOUNCEMENT 

  Australian Democrats Leader, Senator Janet Powell, has welcomed today's  Government announcement that the discredited Business Migration Program is to  be scrapped. 

  Senator Powell said: "The Democrats have consistently raised serious questions  about this scheme, and have been calling for its abandonment for some time. Now  the Government has at last acted on our call." 

  "Simply put, it was immoral for Australia to be 'selling' residency to the wealthy, at  the expense of those in a less fortunate situation. The right to be called 'an  Australian' should never be based on personal wealth." 

  "Suggestions that the Program will be re-vamped and re-marketed as a category of  the Skills Program will not satisfy the objections of the Democrats." 

  "We've also called into question the wisdom of allowing the importation of skilled  workers at a time of high unemployment. We believe the emphasis should be on  skills aquisition by those already facing a bleak future on the dole. The numbers in  this category should be vastly reduced to allow only genuine, urgent needs to be  met." 

  "The Democrats wish to see the future of Australia's immigration program firmly  based on humanitarian considerations, particularly the Family Reunion and Refugee  categories," Senator Powell concluded.
