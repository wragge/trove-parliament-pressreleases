 Transcript, E&OE, proof only 

 8 February 2014 

 JOURNALIST ... I've just got a few questions from our Canberra Bureau just in regard to the asylum 

 seeker issue with claims that hands were burnt. What's your response to that?  

 JULIE BISHOP The ABC has admitted that it published unsubstantiated claims. In my view if they got 

 it wrong they should apologise and then we can move on.  

 What the media should be focussing upon is the fact that we have now prevented deaths at sea. It's 

 been over 50 days since an asylum seeker boat made its way to Australia. What that means is we're 

 stopping that dangerous journey to Australia where in the past, over 1100 people died on that journey. 

 So we're stopping the boats, we promised the Australian people we would do that, we're working hard 

 to do it.  

 I think the focus should be on sending a message to the criminal syndicates that make up the people 

 smuggling trade that the Australian Government is determined to dismantle the trade and to stop the 

 boats.  

 ...  

 JOURNALIST Just on Schapelle Corby, what's your reaction to Schapelle being granted parole?  

 JULIE BISHOP The Australian Government welcomes the decision. I'm sure it will come as a great 

 relief for Schapelle Corby and her family and friends. The decision by Indonesia's Minister for Law and 

 Human Rights is welcomed.  

 I understand that now that the decision to grant parole has been made it will be a matter for authorities 

 to determine the timing of her release but I hope that she is now given some privacy as she gets her 

 life back together.  

 JOURNALIST Will the Australian Government be doing anything to stop her profiting from her crime?  

 JULIE BISHOP As a principle the Australian Government believes that people should not profit from 

 crime, but this is a matter ultimately for the Australian Federal Police and the Director of Public 

 Prosecutions - that area of profit from crime is independent of government.  

 JOURNALIST What would you say to media organisations that may be vying now, you know, putting 

 millions of dollars in the kitty to try and buy her story?  

 JULIE BISHOP I would imagine that Ms Corby would want some peace and privacy and if she asks for 

 that I hope they will respect that request.  

 She is on parole, she will be in Indonesia throughout her parole period and if she requests privacy I 

 hope she's given that privacy. I'm sure she will want some peace and some time with her family.  

 JOURNALIST Do you anticipate that will actually happen though?  

 JULIE BISHOP Well that's a matter for the media organisations involved and Ms Corby but I'm sure 

 it's a relief for her to get the news that she's been granted parole. The Australian Government, both the 

 former and the current, have supported her parole application since it was first lodged in October 2012.  

 JOURNALIST She is a convicted drug smuggler, do you think she should profit from her crime?  

 JULIE BISHOP As I said, the Australian Government believes in the principle that people should not 

 profit from crime, but whether or not these circumstances arise or whether or not action is taken, will 

 be a matter for the Australian Federal Police and for the Director of Public Prosecutions. These are 

 matters independent of government.  

 JOURNALIST Ms Bishop, this morning the Advertiser reported that there is a private consortium keen 

 to buy the Holden site. Is a private company supporting manufacturing in Australia something that the 

 Federal Government would support?  

 JULIE BISHOP I have been having discussions over the past few days with Steven Marshall about his 

 vision and his plans to get the South Australian economy moving again and he's determined to get 

 more investment into South Australia, to get the sluggish economy moving, it is lagging behind other 

 economies in this country and one of these issues is leveraging the investment from the private sector. 

 I have read the reports of that, we'll see whether that transpires.  

 But my Liberal colleague Steve Marshall has got some great ideas and some great plans to stimulate 

 the economy here in South Australia and I hope that at the election in March South Australians will 

 give Steve Marshall the opportunity to get this State moving again.  

 I'm from South Australia, my family live here, I love this State, it has so much potential, it has so many 

 natural assets — I mean just look at this glorious beach! We have to get more international visitors 

 here to South Australia, to get trade and exports going. That's the plan Steve Marshall has for the 

 State and I certainly support it.
