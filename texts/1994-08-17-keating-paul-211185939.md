  PRIME MINISTER 

  STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP 

  FAREWELL OF TROOPS TO RWANDA 

  I will visit Townsville on Saturday 20 August 1994 to farewell the main  contingent of Australian peacekeeping forces who will be leaving that day for  Rwanda. 

  The troops are part of the more than 300-strong Australian contingent which  will provide medical support for the United Nations UNAMIR operations in  Rwanda. 

  The force will also provide assistance to Rwandan civilians. 

  The advance Australian party arrived in Kigali on 8 August. 

  Their role and that of the United Nations force as a whole will be vital in  creating conditions in Rwanda which will enable refugees to return from the  border areas and resume normal lives. 

  The Australian troops will go with the good wishes of all Australians.
