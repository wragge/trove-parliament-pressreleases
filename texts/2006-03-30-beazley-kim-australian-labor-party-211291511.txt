 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP,  CENTRE FOR SUSTAINABLE ENERGY  SYSTEMS,   AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY  -  30 MARCH 2006   

 E & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:     Sustainable energy; Indonesian Cartoon; Industrial Relations;  AWB/terms of reference; Civil Unions for same sex couples; Another  Immigration Department bungle; Smart card.   

 BEAZLEY: Australia has got be the Silicon Valley of solar.  This means jobs.  It  means we take the lead in ensuring that what needs to be done with the world’s  energy supply to start to eliminate the threat of extreme climate change is done 

 effectively.  We must not let the brilliant Australian inventions, the great  Australian in science, be a product of somebody else’s commercialisation.    

 We’re already seen how good research done in the universities in New South  Wales has massively enriched Chinese industry.  We have got to make  absolutely certain that the good work done here means jobs for Australians as  well as affordable, clean energy supplies which deal with carbon emissions  problems.  The work being done in this lab, the work being done at the Australian  National University, in association with Australian companies, massively reduces  the cost of solar energy, brings it close to the costs of other similar clean  technologies in wind power, in clean coal, that’s coal with gas sequestration  taking place associated with its use.  This is absolutely essential for affordable,  good energy supplies.     

 We put out a Blueprint on climate change and in that Blueprint we said the  Australian Government must look to what it needs to do to assist research and to  assist development of good Australian invented technologies.  This is absolutely  at the cutting edge of what an Australian Government should focus on.  So, when  we talked about climate change and how Australia should address it, one of the  things we said was: the good news is the technologies to deal with the problem  are there or thereabouts.  It’s not as though we have to invent a whole new array  of things, we simply have to properly exploit inventing which has already been  done.   

 You couldn’t get a better example of exploitable activity around something that  has already been done than you could get in these labs with the Sliver  technology which reduces the cost of the relevant cells by something like 75 per  cent.   

 

 JOURNALIST: Do you have other examples of where Australian innovation  is missing out on market opportunities particularly in energy fields?   

 BEAZLEY:  I think the problem is Australian innovation in the end doesn’t  miss out, it becomes somebody else’s innovation.  You know, the classic thing is:  marvellous work done by Australian scientist here, development takes place in  the West Coast of the United States or in China or somewhere else.  The thing is  any Australian invention with great commercial purpose and great commercial  capacity actually does get picked up - the problem is it doesn’t get picked up  here.  And we have to make certain, and there’s a good start being made on it in 

 relation to this technology that we’re dealing with here, that it will be developed  here in this country.     

 The Australian research and development investment, by commercial companies  in particular, and also to a degree by public investment as well, is appalling.   It is  one of the lowest levels in the OECD and going backwards - shocking.  Now, a  government that’s concerned about investing in the future of Australia has got to  change those figures.  Take a look at the tax system; take a look at how we do  our research and development; how we invest in and fund the universities.   These are the things which are going to ensure Australian survival and success.   And they’re a million miles from the agenda of the Howard Government.   

 JOURNALIST: The two dogs cartoon, how do you view that development?   

 BEAZLEY:  I actually think it’s tragic that things have come to this pass.   One of the problems for the Prime Minister is that he’s been hoist on his own  petard here.  We convinced the Indonesians, the Prime Minister convinced the  Indonesians he is serious about keeping refugees away from Australian shores, 

 inviting them to participate in our schemes and all the rest of it.  What the  Indonesians did not understand is the Prime Minister didn’t mean it, that in fact all  those refugees are now in Australia or New Zealand.  So, they took the Prime  Minister at face value and then they saw what happened in New Guinea which  was a perfectly ordinary processing, not insulting, a perfect ordinary processing  of Australian law in relation to people who came to our shores and made a claim  for refugee status.  There is no agenda here.  This doesn’t represent anything as  far as the Australian Government is concerned or anyone in Australia in terms of  undermining our recognition of the incorporation within Indonesia of West Papua  Irian Jaya.  There is not challenge to that in Australia.  We are not trying to  dissolve Indonesian federation.     

 Because of the way in which the Prime Minister has handled these issues in the  past, is the way in which he’s presented to the Indonesians, which have been in  fact, somewhat different from is really being done, we’ve got ourselves into this  bind.  Now, I hope that the Indonesians understand that we mean nothing bad by  what we’ve done or nothing that seeks to undermine their security.  And because 

 we don’t, we in the Opposition, don’t believe that any conclusions were  incorrectly reached by those that made a study of the people who were  applicants.   

 JOURNALIST: Greg Combet appears have intimated that Labor could adapt  its IR policy towards the open trading economy that now exists.  Is this in any  way in conflict with your proposal to rip up the WorkChoices legislation?   

 BEAZLEY:  No, we’re going to rip it up.  There is absolutely nothing in  this legislation that’s worthwhile, nothing at all.  All the issues about State  tribunals, Federal tribunals, they can all be resolved by the relevant parties sitting  down and getting a decent outcome.  This insult that Howard keeps delivering to  the Australian workforce, the hardest working workforce in the industrialised  world, works more hours than any other workforce - and I include here  Americans, Japanese, Dutch, Europeans generally - we work longer hours in  this country.  This vicious insult that the Howard Government keeps delivering  towards ordinary Australians needs to be identified for what it is.     

 Well, we’re going to rip up these laws and we’re going to put fair laws in place.   You saw an example of that in what we did last week.  It’s not exactly the same  as the previous unfair dismissal laws.  We recognised there were certain  problems in the opportunities to exploit that system by rogue employees, as well  as rogue employers.  We put in place, or suggested should be put in place, a  better tribunal, a better process.  Well, that’s an example of how we’re going to  handle all of this as we restore fairness to the system.   

 JOURNALIST: Well, just further to that, your colleague, George Campbell,  this morning suggested that soon some employees might start leaving a screw  out of place in their work on production lines in retaliation.  Do you think that’s  likely to happen? 

 

 BEAZLEY:  I wouldn’t encourage that but one thing we’ve seen in the  case of what’s just happened in Victoria is really very serious and it’s an angle  that I had not thought about, I must admit, on unfair dismissals.  That is, an  employer advertises for a new workforce, or a new group of workers, and works  out what he’s got out there in the market, works out what he can pay them in  terms of paying them less than his current workforce, then just wholesale sacks  his existing workforce, brings them in at cheaper rates.     

 That is now open to employers in this country and they will do it.  They will do it.   There’s no question about that.  The real stories that emerge from this industrial  relations climate over the next 18 months are going to be stories of families with  their capacity to live a comfortable and decent life, ripped away. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Do you think the terms of reference for the AWB inquiry  should be extended? 

 

 BEAZLEY:  Absolutely.  You see, at the same time as John Howard is  ripping off the standards of ordinary workers, he is running away from the  examination of the standards of his Ministry.  Every Australian believes that what  is going on at the Cole Commission is an inspection not just simply of the AWB  officials, but an inspection of the Government as well.  Now, no determinations  can be made about the Government and their handling of this, and that’s exactly  how John Howard wants it.  He’s letting his incompetent Ministers and himself off  the hook and he is doing it quite deliberately.     

 We have called for the sort of performance and inquiry that our allies expect of  us.  And they’re entitled to expect it of us, they after all are the people copping  most of the bullets that we’ve paid for.  They’re copping most of the bullets that  we’ve paid for.  And they are entitled to get to the bottom of this and Howard is  determined that they shan’t.   

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, the ACT is moving to legalise, or I think that’s  the correct term, civil unions for same-sex couples for 16 year-olds.  The Federal  Government appears to be trying to intervene.  What do you think should be 

 done?   

 BEAZLEY:  They’re looking at civil unions for same-sex partners on the  same basis, I understand, for heterosexual partners.  We had our own  declaration in relation to marriage on that in the federal Caucus.  We’ve always  taken the view, except on matters of life and death like euthanasia, the Territories  ought to be treated effectively in the same way as States.  So, it’s early days in 

 this issue yet.  The Caucus will have a chance to think about it.  We’ll look at it  carefully when Mr Ruddock brings his bill to the House.  But we do approach it  from the basis that, by and large, we think the Territory should be left to  themselves in the same way as the States are.   

 JOURNALIST: The Ombudsman’s investigation into the Immigration  Department seems to have uncovered another case - a man who claims he’s  Bangladeshi, a diabetic - and the Immigration Department’s thinking about 

 deporting him back to Bangladesh, even though Bangladesh doesn’t recognise  him as a citizen.  What do you think should be done?  Is this another indication of  the Immigration Department not really having its views correct?   

 BEAZLEY:  Two things I’d say on that.  Firstly, a message to Amanda:  let the man stay and be properly treated.  We owe him that.  The second  message is we’ve got to have a Royal Commission into this show.  The  Ombudsman has done a pretty fair job, as far as I can see, in analysing some of  these problems.  What he’s not been able to get at is Ministerial responsibility for  this culture.     

 If we wanted to turn Ministers from behaving in the hopeless, incompetent way  the Ministers of this Government generally behave in, you’ve actually got to hold  them to account.   

 

 You need to hold them to account on AWB instead of getting a whole lot of  cowboys who have been wandering around Iraq but nevertheless wandering  around with the Government Ministers turning a deliberate blind eye to it. If you  want to stop that in the future the best way of doing it is to hold Ministers  accountable.  That’s the best way of doing it.     

 These Ministers and this Prime Minister live in coward’s castle, coward’s castle of  his sub-standard approach to Ministerial responsibility.  He thinks he’s smart.  He  thinks he’s got away with a level of accountability that would never be permitted  in the United Kingdom.  You saw Tony Blair out there this week.  Now, Tony  Blair’s Ministers are held to account and they resign when they’re caught for  doing not one half of what Alexander Downer, Mark Vaile, and John Howard  have done.  And it’s sloppy, slovenly standards of this rotten government have  actually got to start to be held to account.     

 As far as Immigration is concerned, the sloppy standards of those worthless  Ministers for Immigration that this Government has had need to be subject to a  Royal Commission. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Do you think we need a Smart Card here in Australia?   

 BEAZLEY:  We once had the idea of an Australia Card and we pursued  it and were rolled by the Liberals.  We thought that that ought to be done  basically as a check against welfare fraud and tax fraud.  Since then other  mechanisms have come into place which largely take account of that.  One of the  things we know is that it is possible to alter those cards, it is possible to steal  people’s identity and it’s very expensive to get a fool proof card.     

 So, we’re happy to take at look at anybody who’s got a proposal for this, but if it’s  going to cost us billions of dollars, I don’t think it’s worth the candle.  One of the  things you’ve always got to remember is all those heinous terrorists who  committed those outrages in London - every one of them would have had a valid  identity card, every one of them.  So, as a protection in that regard I’m a bit  suspicious.     

 You know, in the United States where identity theft is now all the go, they have  an interesting way of dealing with it when your identity has been thieved.  They  arrange for you an administrative death you actually, as an individual, die - you  die administratively and then they recreate you.  I think Australians would 

 probably get a bit suspicious about that.
