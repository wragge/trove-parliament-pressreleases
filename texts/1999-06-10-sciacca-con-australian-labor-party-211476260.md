  MEDIA RELEASE

  The Hon. Con Sciacca MP

  Federal Member for Bowman

  Shadow Minister for Immigration

  Shadow Minister Assisting the Leader of the Opposition on Multicultural 
Affairs

  

  NO AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SAYS LABOR

  

 A future Labor Government would under   no circumstances  grant a general amnesty to illegal immigrants.

  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration Con Sciacca said he 
had been made aware today of rumours being circulated in some countries 
by people smugglers that upon attaining Government, the Labor Party 
would grant a general amnesty to illegal immigrants.

  

 “Nothing could be further from the truth,” Mr 
Sciacca said.

  

 Mr Sciacca said that Labor is committed to maintaining 
the integrity of Australia’s Migration Program, and strongly opposes 
queue jumping and non-genuine refugees being granted asylum in Australia.

  

 “Let there be no mistake on this issue - Labor will   NOT EVEN CONSIDER  
granting a general amnesty. We will however pursue every avenue available 
to us including allocating sufficient resources to ensure that the integrity 
of our national border is maintained.

  

 “Labor abhors the concept of people smuggling and 
while we feel compassion for the innocent victims of these traders of 
human cargo, let them be under no illusion - Labor will be as tough, 
if not tougher than the present Government on illegal immigrants.

  

 “I have today written to the Minister for Immigration, 
Philip Ruddock requesting that he distribute widely a copy of this statement 
to our overseas posts, particularly those posts in countries where people 
smugglers are known to be most active,” Mr Sciacca said.
