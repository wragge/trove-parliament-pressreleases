  MPS 98/97  Funding boost for Tasmania settlement services  "The Government has demonstrated its commitment to regional Australia with community grants  commencing today to organisations which serve regional, rural and remote communities" the Minister  for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today. 

  The successful Tasmania organisations who help migrants and humanitarian entrants to settle in  Australia, were announced by the Minister on 28 August as a $198 275 package of awards under the  Community Settlement Services (CSS) Scheme and the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy . 

  "The funding is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to helping migrants and refugees  settle quickly into their new community, including people outside the major metropolitan areas," said  MrRuddock . 

  "The new grant arrangements focus on meeting community needs while at the same time ensuring the  Government and community receive value for money." 

  Mr Ruddock said Tasmania had received 10 awards which included funding for five projects in the  State. 

  "Around 50 per cent of the awards have gone to organisations serving regional , rural and remote  communities of Tasmania, including the Launceston Chinese Association , the Iranian Society of  Tasmania, the Migrant Resource Centre North at Launceston, the West Ulverstone Community, the  International Womens Health Group and the Wynyard Migrant Resource Centre," said Mr Ruddock. 

  "Many of these projects involve advising new arrivals where they can obtain information that will  make their settlement in Australia easier. 

  "In particular, many of the rural grants will enable groups to provide direct assistance to new arrivals,  while other grants are aimed at ensuring people know where to go for the right advice and guidance." 

  The Minister said the money would help fund: 

   " information and referral services for recent arrivals , particularly from small and emerging  communities and in rural Tasmania;   " specific service provision and case management for refugees and other humanitarian entrants   " support for high-need groups such as humanitarian entrants; and   " support services for young people, women and elderly migrants.  "This package of funding reflects the Government's commitment to providing services which help  migrants and humanitarian entrants settle in their new country and quickly become contributing  member s of our community," Mr Ruddock said.
