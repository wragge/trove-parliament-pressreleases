 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Thursday, 4 September 2014    

 Labor and Liberal refuse to vote on Iraqi  refugees    

 The Labor and Liberal parties have refused to allow the Greens to move a motion in the Senate,  calling for a moratorium on returning refugees to Iraq and Syria.    

 “Refusing to deal with this issue isn’t good enough when people are fleeing for their lives,” the  Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “The situation in Iraq is extremely unstable and the government should place a halt on sending  refugees back there.    

 “By denying a Parliamentarian the right to move a motion, the Labor and Liberal parties are  attempting to suppress debate on this crucial topic.    

 “The Australian government has recognised the humanitarian crisis in Iraq, yet it is still sending  asylum seekers back there.    

 “Offering protection to some, while slamming the door in the face of others, is both dangerous  and unfair.    

 “As a developed, wealthy democracy Australia should be playing a far greater role in protecting  those who are fleeing from Syria and Iraq.”
