 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling GOVERNMENT CAN'T HIDE BORDER  FAILURE AS ANOTHER BOAT ARRIVES March 14, 2013

 The latest illegal boat arrival, with 49 people on board, comes as the Government tries to put up a smokescreen to distract  from their failure on our borders, but they can't hide the fact the boats keep coming, Shadow Minister for Immigration Scott  Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 "In the past ten days eight boats have arrived and so far in 2013 boat arrivals are up 50 per cent from last year," Mr  Morrison said.

 "Even further capsizing and rescues at sea have failed to shift the Government's refusal to restore the proven measures  they abolished to stop the boats including denying permanent residence to people coming on boats.

 "As the boats continue to come, more and more people are being dumped into the community with no guidelines or  safeguards, out of sight, out of mind from a Government that remains in denial of the problem," Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “More than three times the amount of people have arrived so far this month than in the entire month of  March last year.

 “Given that we had more boat arrivals last year than in any other year before it shows that 2013 is shaping up to be yet  another shameful record breaking year for arrivals under Labor.

 “Labor will have an opportunity to support and restore temporary protection visas in the Parliament next week - a vital part  of the Howard Government’s border protection policies that stopped the boats from coming.

 “The Government need to swallow their pride and reintroduce this policy that removes the main selling point for the people  smugglers - permanent residence in Australia.

 “After the arrival of almost 34,000 people by boat it is time this Government admitted their failure and reinstated the tough  border protection policies of the Coalition,” Mr Keenan said.
