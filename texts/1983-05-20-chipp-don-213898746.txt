 DEMOCRATS WELCOME GOVERNMENT'S IMMIGRATION REVIEW

 The Australian Democrats have broadly welcomed the Government's 

 review of the migrant intake announcement on Wednesday 18 May 1983

 "Although we favour an increase in total migration whenever 

 possible, we recognise that in times, of economic hardship 

 the intake of skilled migrants has to be reduced," Senator 

 Don Chipp said.  .  .

 Senator Chipp is the Leader of the Australian Democrats

 and the Party's Spokesperson on Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.

 "We are delighted that the present Government has increased 

 the emphasis on family reunions and refugees.  The removal 

 of the English language requirement and other financial 

 barriers for family reunions is an improvement that has come 

 none too soon.  .

 "The re-allocation of emphasis in the refugee intake to 

 Latin Americans is recognition of the hardship that hundreds 

 and thousands of people in that region of the world have 

 to bear," Senator Chipp said. .

 "All in all, it is a promising start by the Government.  We 

 will be ensuring they continue in the same view," Senator 

 Chipp concluded.
