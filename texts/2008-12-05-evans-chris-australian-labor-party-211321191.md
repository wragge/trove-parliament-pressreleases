 New appointments to Migration and Refugee Review Tribunals 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, today announced  the appointment of 43 Members to the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and the  Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT). 

 'I am pleased to announce the appointment of these 43 Members to the MRT-RRT.  Of these 43 appointees, 31 are current Members of the Tribunals while 12 are new  appointments,' Senator Evans said. 

 The successful applicants were unanimously selected through a merit-based  process by a panel consisting of the First Assistant Secretary Client Services and  Network Performance Division, Department of Immigration and Citizenship; the Merit  Protection Commissioner; the Principal Member of the Tribunals; and a community  representative from the Victorian Foundation for Survivors of Torture. 

 'This decision opened the process to the best possible candidates and has ensured  a fair and robust selection process,' Senator Evans said.  

 'In accordance with the Australian Public Service Commission guidelines on statutory  office holders, I chose not to reappoint the 39 current Members whose terms expire  on 30 June 2009 because I wished to test the field of potential candidates.  

 'Instead, I invited the current Members to apply and 36 of the 39 subsequently  lodged an application. 

 'I endorsed the selection panel's recommendations based on the applicants'  demonstrated strong sense of fairness and understanding of the principles of  administrative law and their ability to apply these skills in determining review  applications. 

 'I look forward to their contribution to the tribunals and their commitment to the  effective delivery of review decisions,' Senator Evans said. 

 Members have been appointed for five years commencing on 1 July 2009 and  ending on 30 June 2014. 

 Further information about the role of the tribunals can be obtained from the tribunals'  website.  See: www.mrt-rrt.gov.au
