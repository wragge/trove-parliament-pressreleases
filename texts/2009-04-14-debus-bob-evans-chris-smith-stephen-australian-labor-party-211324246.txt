 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  STEPHEN SMITH, MP 

 

 TRANSCRIPTION: PROOF COPY E & OE 

 DATE:   14 April 2009 

 TITLE:  JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE, MINISTER FOR FOREIGN  AFFAIRS, STEPHEN SMITH; MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION, CHRIS  EVANS; MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS, BOB DEBUS - PERTH 

 SUBJECTS: Bali Process; Thailand, DPRK, Fiji, Asylum Seekers, Rohingyas,  Sri Lanka, Australians detained in Papua 

 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Thanks very much for coming along this morning. I'm very pleased to  be here with my Western Australian colleague, Chris Evans, the Leader of the Government in  the Senate and Minister for Immigration; and also my New South Wales colleague, Bob  Debus, the Minister for Home Affairs. 

 Later this morning we'll be leaving Perth, travelling to Bali, Indonesia, to take part in the third  Ministerial meeting of the Bali Process or more formally, the Bali Process on People  Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons, and Related Transnational Crime. 

 The Bali Process was established in 2002. There have been two previous Ministerial  meetings.  The last one was in 2003. 

 It's co-chaired by Australia and Indonesia, and so at the meeting in Bali today and tomorrow,  my Foreign Ministerial colleague, Hassan Wirajuda and I will co-chair the meeting. The  Australian delegation will be led by Senator Evans as Minister for Immigration. 

 This third Ministerial meeting of the Bali Process has been called effectively at Australia and  Indonesia's request, to ensure the maximum possible regional cooperation, so far as  combating people smuggling, people trafficking, and illegal human movement is concerned. 

 We of course know that very many so-called push factors operate in the modern day; and we  need to work in close cooperation with our partners in the region, in South East Asia, with  Indonesia in particular, to combat people movement and people smuggling. 

 One of the issues that we'll be discussing at the conference will be one of the more recent  regional problems that has arisen: the issue of the Rohingyas. And so Foreign Minister  Wirajuda and I, together with our Burmese and Thai colleagues, will be having a conversation 

 

  2

 about the Rohingyas issue which you would remember came to public prominence in the  course of this year. 

 So having set the scene I'll ask Senator Evans to make some remarks, and then Minister  Debus to make some remarks, and then we're happy to respond to your questions on the Bali  Process or other matters that are of interest this morning. 

 Chris. 

 CHRIS EVANS: Thanks Stephen. 

 We're very pleased that this Bali Process is going to go ahead. We've been focused on  reinvigorating the Process for the last year. 

 Mr Debus and I travelled through South East Asia last year encouraging people to  reinvigorate the Bali Process and to participate. We've found a great deal of interest in doing  that, and, so this meeting coming together is a sign of that interest. 

 I think it reflects a growing awareness inside the region that irregular people movement is  going to be a large and growing issue for the region in coming years. 

 We've seen an increase in numbers of people moving irregularly through the region. We've  seen the push factors out of Afghanistan, Iraq, Sri Lanka, and other nations, and Bangladesh;  where we've seen our neighbours dealing with these problems. And we've had to deal with 

 those problems as people sought to seek asylum in Australia as well. 

 The beauty about this conference is that people who are source, transit, and destination  countries will all be represented. And, the leadership of Indonesia is important. I've met with  their Immigration Minister, Mr Mattalatta, on four occasions, and he is focused, as we are, on  finding common approaches to the irregular movement of people through the region. 

 The cooperation of Indonesia with the Australian Government has been first rate. They have  assisted us in attempting to break up people smuggling rings, to try and combat the irregular  movement through the region. And we're looking to extend that cooperation, both with  Indonesia and with other neighbouring countries. 

 And they, of course, are also dealing with their own problems, as Mr Smith indicated, such as  the movement of Rohingyas and others in quite large numbers. 

 So I think there's an agreed focus in the region to deal with these issues. 

 There's also enormous issues of people trafficking, which Mr Debus has been leading on. 

 So we think this Process will be really useful in refocusing attention and combining in our  efforts to deal with what is a serious, and at the moment growing problem in the region. And  we think this will allow us to develop strategies to work with our neighbours to try and  combat these problems. 

 Maybe Bob wants to say a few words.

 BOB DEBUS: Thank you. I would just emphasise what my colleagues have said with respect  to the, the character of the problem of people smuggling, and indeed people trafficking. 

 These are regional problems. They cannot be resolved by one country alone. They can only be  dealt with satisfactorily by widespread cooperation between the authorities in countries that  are source countries and countries that are transit countries and those that are destination  countries. 

 I should say too that there will nevertheless be no diminution in the effort that Australia puts  in to restraining, interrupting, and detecting attempts at people smuggling. 

 It's worth emphasising, I think, that the assets that we apply to this purpose - the naval vessels  and the customs vessels and the coast watch aeroplanes and the RAAF aeroplanes, and the  now better coordinated intelligence and administrative arrangements that exist within the 

 Australian Government continue to be directed to the restraint of people smuggling where  ever that is attempted. 

 At the same time, I think it's very important to keep the issue in perspective. 

 Last year in Italy they had 35,000 entrants who had been brought to Italian shores by people  smugglers; Greece had 15,000. In the not too distant past, Australia has had more than 6,000  people. That's the kind of context perhaps we should be thinking about the present arrivals in. 

 Nevertheless, no doubt you'll all have some questions of one or more of us. 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Thanks Bob. 

 Alright, just before we take questions; I should have mentioned of course that, and it's the  point that Senator Evans and Bob have both made, is that countries represented at the  conference include those countries from where we have displaced peoples; those countries  who are transit countries and those countries who are destination countries. 

 Some 40 to 50 countries and international organisations will be represented, including the  International Organisation for Migration and the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees, two of the premier international institutions so far as these matters are concerned. 

 So, we're happy to respond to your questions on these matters, or other matters. 

 QUESTION: Minister, has the seven-year hiatus between the last meeting and this meeting  contributed to the people smuggling and arrivals do you think? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well certainly, in our discussions, particularly with Indonesia, we've  made the point that the regional cooperation and regional integration of effort is very  important; and Australia took the view that it was time to have the Bali Process reconvened at 

 Ministerial level. 

 There have of course in the interim been meetings at officer levels. So it's not as if there hasn't  been ongoing application to regional coordination. 

 

  4

 But, because we do see this as an ongoing issue, an ongoing problem, an ongoing difficulty,  it's absolutely essential to make sure that at the highest levels these issues are understood.   And there is cooperation, not just nation to nation, or government to government, but also  relevant agency to relevant agency.  Whether that is police or Customs or border patrol or  indeed intelligence agencies for disruption purposes. 

 I'm happy for Bob or Chris to add. 

 QUESTION: Regarding Thailand, should the King get involved do you think in the crisis  over there? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: We want to see these matters resolved by and through the Thai  democratic and political process. 

 And I've made the point earlier today; we certainly don't want to see any military intervention  which goes beyond the military respecting the Thai constitution and taking care of law and  order matters consistent with Thai constitution and Thai laws. 

 The King is very well respected and regarded in Thailand, in Thai society and Thai culture.  And in the past, when these difficult issues have confronted the Thai political system, he has  from time to time made comments or let his views be known. That's entirely a matter for him  and entirely a matter for the Thai system. 

 QUESTION: So you don't, you won't comment as to whether or not you think that he should  use his persuasion in this respect? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: It's entirely a matter for the King; and entirely a matter for him to make  his judgements about the appropriateness of him making his views known in the face of the  current difficult and volatile situation in Thailand. 

 QUESTION: What are you thoughts on the UN statement on the North Korean rocket  launch? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: We support it very much. The declaration effectively reaffirms United  Nations Security Council Resolution 1718. It makes the point that the North Korean missile  launch was in breach of UNSC Resolution 1718, which Australia has strongly supported. 

 When you deal with that breach in conjunction with North Korea's ongoing recalcitrance on  their nuclear program, you see the danger and the concern which confronts the international  community. 

 So we strongly support what's come out of the Security Council overnight. 

 QUESTION: On a different issue - could we just get a comment where Australia is at on Fiji  at the moment? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: We condemn absolutely recent events in Fiji. 

 

  5

 Commodore Bainimarama has essentially appointed himself as a self-appointed dictator, a  military dictator. This is very regressive for Fiji. We believe that unless and until Fiji returns  to democracy, we'll continue to see a deterioration in Fiji's economic and social  circumstances.  

 QUESTION: Has the time come for Fiji to be evicted from the Commonwealth? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well, the Commonwealth, through the Commonwealth Ministerial  Advisory Group which met in London in February-March earlier this year, and the Pacific  Island Forum, which met the leaders who met in Papua New Guinea, met in Port Moresby in  January this year, have both effectively resolved that unless Fiji puts itself on a road to  democracy on the timetable set out by the Pacific Island Forum, Fiji can expect to be 

 suspended from the forums of both the Pacific Island Forum and the Commonwealth. 

 And given what has occurred in recent days, unless there is some dramatic reversal of that, it  is in my view almost inevitable that Fiji will be suspended both from the Pacific Island Forum  and from the Commonwealth itself.  

 QUESTION: What's the time frame for that Mr Smith? When would that be likely to occur  [indistinct]? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: The time frame set by the Pacific Island Forum communiquÃ© was to see  that by 1 May this year, Fiji had taken genuine steps to move towards democracy.  

 Not only have we not seen any genuine steps, we've seen very regressive conduct on the part  of Commodore Bainimarama and his regime. The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group  which met in London in February-March effectively put the Commonwealth on the same  timetable.  

 QUESTION: In terms of applying more pressure to Fiji, have you considered what form that  might take?  

 STEPHEN SMITH: Australia currently has sanctions against Fiji. We are effectively at the  forefront of sanctions. We have travel sanctions against members of the regime. We also have  restrictions on Ministerial contact with Fiji interim Government Ministers. We also have a  ban on defence contact, and we have restrictions on development assistance.  

 In the meantime, of course, we have continued to apply humanitarian assistance; and we have  endeavoured to target our sanctions and our policy approach to putting pressure on the  regime. We don't want to do things which would have an adverse impact on the people of Fiji  themselves.  Which is why, for example, we haven't and don't contemplate trade sanctions and  the like.  

 We're in discussion as we speak with our partners in the Pacific, members of the Pacific  Island Forum, also the UN and the Commonwealth, to see what more, if any, pressure can be  brought to bear by the international community on the regime. But Australia and New 

 Zealand have both been at the forefront in terms of the sanctions that are currently imposed.  

 

  6

 QUESTION: Just returning to asylum seekers, can I ask Mr Evans [indistinct]? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Sure.  

 QUESTION: What cooperation will the delegation ask of the Indonesian Government in  terms of, will you be asking them to increase presence at the departure points or harbours  where recent asylum seeker boats have been leaving from? 

 CHRIS EVANS: We've had tremendous cooperation with the Indonesians for a number  of years on those issues. Their local police are cooperating with Australian authorities in  trying to prevent departures. There have been a large number of successful interruptions. 

 What we've been dealing with in the last few years is a change in tactics which has required  us to divert more resources and adopt some different approaches, but the Indonesian  cooperation has been very good.  

 What we've seen, though, is a large number of Afghans, in particular, moving through the  region, both in Indonesia and Malaysia and other countries, and certainly they've been the  source of most of the unauthorised arrivals in recent times.  But the Indonesians are making  huge efforts to cooperate.  

 We've improved our immigration, the cooperation with them by significant resources in  recent times, and their cooperation, as I say, can't be faulted, but we are dealing with some  new tactics.  

 We are dealing with quite strong push factors out of Afghanistan and Iraq and Sri Lanka, and  one of the things we've been seeking to do is to work with them to see if we can't improve  their domestic legal arrangements. They currently don't have in our view enough capacity to  prosecute people smugglers in Indonesia.  

 And one of the things that's on the agenda for the Bali process is more common approaches to  legal frameworks to ensure we can deal with people smugglers and people traffickers under  the law, across the region; that we have this more common approach so as to deal with the  threat which is multinational.  

 QUESTION: The most recent arrivals that came this last week, do you know what stage the  process is at with those - with that group of suspected asylum seekers at Christmas Island? 

 CHRIS EVANS: Well, they will be interviewed under the normal processes. As you  know, we've retained mandatory detention of all those arriving unauthorised. They'll have  health, security, and identity checks, and as part of that process, be interviewed by  immigration but also by the AFP, so that we get as much information as to who they are, how  they came to seek to enter Australia.  As I say, they undergo the normal health and security  checks, as well as being mandatorily detained to tell those checks have been completed.  

 QUESTION: Is our ocean surveillance adequate though, when a boatload of people can pull  up at a jetty at Christmas Island?  

 

  7

 CHRIS EVANS: I'll let Mr Debus answer that question; I think probably best, I think.  

 QUESTION: Has an inquiry been launched into that particular incident? 

 CONVENER: Well, just let him answer the first one.  

 BOB DEBUS: Obviously we are attempting to discover more about the exact circumstances  of the arrival of that boat. 

 But let's be clear, as I mentioned before, we actually have somewhat more Naval, Customs,  and Air Force activity now than existed, say, in the latter years of the Howard Government; it  all coordinated through what is called Border Protection Command.  

 But you're dealing with a quite massive area of ocean and coastline. You think the world's  largest archipelago, the vast coastline of Australia, and all the ocean in between, and our  surveillance is inevitably and properly informed by intelligence. You can't expect that every  boat or every square kilometre of the sea will always be covered. 

 Our surveillance is guided by intelligence, intelligence that comes through our own authorities  and through Indonesian authorities. And the essential point is that we protect the Australian  mainland, that we protect our own border. Don't forget that Christmas Island is still more than  1000 kilometres away from Australia.  

 QUESTION: But has an inquiry been launched into that particular incident? 

 BOB DEBUS: We are making a number of inquiries at the moment, we're investigating the   matter. There is not a formal inquiry. There is an investigation of the circumstances.  

 QUESTION: Does that particular incident highlight a failure in our border security?  

 BOB DEBUS: I think I just answered that particular question.  

 QUESTION: We've had three boatloads arrive in the past few weeks; do you have any  information to suggest more on their way?  

 BOB DEBUS: We know that the numbers of boats that are launched, the number of attempts  that there are at people smuggling, is most affected by what my colleagues have been  referring to as push factors. 

 If you have more difficulty in the circumstances of the population of Sri Lanka, or  Afghanistan, or Pakistan, which is what we have, then you must expect that there will be  within a relatively short time more attempts by people to reach a country of preferred  destination like Australia.  

 I emphasise again that the numbers of people attempting to arrive by boat in Australia is still  very small by international standards, and it's very small even by our own historical standards.  We must be concerned. We will not diminish the level of surveillance and interdiction that we  are presently engaged in. But you must keep the actual numbers in some kind of perspective.  

 

  8

 QUESTION: Has the [indistinct] of the Pacific Solution increased the numbers?  

 BOB DEBUS: I don't think that changes in Australian Government policy, important as they  have been from the point of view of compassionate treatment of refugees, have had any  particular effect one way or other, on the numbers of people that are attempting to arrive  unauthorised by boat. You just have to look at history to know that's the case.  

 For instance, when the Howard Government introduced Temporary Protection Visas, and  you'll recall that the Opposition has in recent times, several times, suggested that the  abandonment of Temporary Protection Visas was some kind of an incentive for people  smugglers and their clients, when the Howard Government actually introduced Temporary  Protection Visas, the numbers of unauthorised entrants went up a lot.  

 The truth is that the so-called push factors, events in other places, are far more important than  Australian Government policy in determining the numbers of people who will attempt to  arrive here without authorisation.  

 And that is the very reason why we are all going to Bali now to attempt to make  improvements in the regional responses to the problems of people movement.  

 QUESTION: Will you be requesting Thailand [indistinct] the Rohingya people and you  know, the towing them out to sea [indistinct]? 

 BOB DEBUS: I think it's appropriate that the Minister of Foreign Affairs should answer that  question, rather than the person responsible for internal policies here.  

 STEPHEN SMITH: Thanks.  

 That'll be the subject of conversation at the Bali Process meeting. But you might recall when  Foreign Minister Wirajuda was in Australia recently in Sydney, he and I made it clear that we  both wanted that item discussed at the Bali Process.  

 As Senator Evans said earlier, it's one of a number of regional people movement issues and  problems that the region has to confront.  

 Rohingyas, of course, come from Burma, from the Rakhine state in Burma. We also find  Rohingyas, displaced Rohingyas in Bangladesh, and we also find them moving, in terms of a  transit country, past Thailand as well. So there's an interest from a range of countries that will 

 be represented at the Bali Process.  

 It will be one of a number of regional difficulties that we currently face that representatives  there will be addressing. 

 QUESTION: With the increasing violence in Thailand, is there need now to evacuate  Australians? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: No, our advice remains as it was yesterday. I've spoken to our  Ambassador on a couple of occasions this morning. Things today are pretty much as they 

 

  9

 were late last night. Regrettably, of course, overnight there have been two confirmed, possibly  three deaths, and we regret that very much. 

 We continue to urge Australians who are not in Bangkok to reconsider their need to travel to  Bangkok. Those Australians who are in Bangkok, we continue to urge them to avoid  unnecessary travel around the city, to certainly avoid demonstrations, to certainly avoid those 

 locations where the military are based, and to certainly avoid large gatherings given that the  state of emergencies effectively makes gathering of more than five people unlawful. 

 If they do choose or determine to leave Bangkok, then we are advising them to contact the  airport and travel agents before leaving for the airport, and also to leave plenty of time to get  to the airport in case their transport arrangements are disturbed. But at this stage we've got no  indication that scheduled flights or the airport will in any way be disrupted.  

 So our advice remains that people should reconsider their need to travel to Bangkok and  surrounding provinces. But if they are in Bangkok they should be sensible and careful about  their movements around the city; or as I've put it, anecdotally, they should think very much  about staying at home or in the hotel. 

 QUESTION: Just quickly on the [indistinct]… 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Sorry, say again… 

 QUESTION: Just with the Tamil protesters, they're saying that 300 people were killed on  Easter Sunday. Have you got any [indistinct]… 

 STEPHEN SMITH: I've seen that report, I can't confirm it. We have for some time been  very concerned about circumstances in Sri Lanka. For some time I've been calling upon the  Sri Lankan Government to engage in a political dialogue. For some time we've been calling,  together with the rest of the international community, particularly the so-called Tokyo co-conveners, for there to be a cessation of hostilities, to enable civilians who are in the area of  hostilities to remove themselves from the hostile areas. 

 There's been a considerable problem of both firing into, and from, areas where civilians are.  There's also been very grave difficulties in rendering humanitarian assistance to areas where  the conflict has been taking place. 

 We welcome very much the announcement in the last 24-48 hours by the Sri Lankan  Government, by the President, that there will be a so-called holiday truce, which will enable  civilians to exit areas where hostilities have been taking place. We urge the Tamil Tigers to  respect that and to allow the exodus of civilians. 

 We've previously called upon the Tamil Tigers to lay down their arms and engage in a  political dialogue, and we again do that.  

 It's a terrible situation in Sri Lanka; we have become increasingly concerned, as has the rest of  the international community.  

 

  10

 When I was in The Hague recently for the Afghanistan conference, I met with UN Secretary  General Ban Ki-moon; we discussed these matters. We strongly support his recent comments  and his recent efforts and we continue to urge all of those things both upon the Sri Lankan  Government and the Tamil Tigers. 

 There was one up the back, I think. 

 QUESTION: What's the - Minister, what's the latest - the status of the five Australians still  trapped in West Papua? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: They remain under what is called city detention in Merauke. Their  sentencing is still subject to appeal to the Indonesian Supreme Court. As I understand it they  are currently residing in home accommodation in Merauke. We have a consular officer  available to render assistance. 

 My most recent advice is that they are all well, but of course they are becoming increasingly  frustrated, as are we, at the time that is has taken, and is taking, to resolve these matters.  But  unfortunately they are subject to Indonesian legal processes and that is currently an appeal  before the Indonesia Supreme Court on their sentencing.  We simply have to wait until that  legal process is completed. 

 QUESTION: Because they were originally ordered to leave [indistinct]. 

 STEPHEN SMITH: They were sentenced in the first instance. They appealed to the  Jayapura District Court; the Jayapura District Court essentially quashed their sentencing and  effectively ordered their deportation.  

 Before they were either deported or left Indonesia, the prosecutor instituted an appeal to the  Indonesian Supreme Court that effectively stays the decision of the Jayapura District Court.  And as a consequence they are currently in what is described, as I've said, as home, sorry, as  city detention in Merauke where they will remain until the legal processes have been  exhausted and completed. 

 QUESTION: Just getting back to the asylum seekers, just calling on Senator Evans… 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Chris.  

 QUESTION: … has it been confirmed that these latest arrivals are Iraqis? Do you still  imagine that they're seeking asylum? 

 CHRIS EVANS: What I can say at the moment is that they seem to be mainly from the  Middle East and may well be a group of Iraqis and Afghans. But I can't confirm that until  interviews have been completed. But I want to give as much information as possible, and it's  likely that they'll be largely Iraqi and Afghans. But until the interviews are completed it's not  possible to give definitive information. 

 

  11

 QUESTION: Are those as… are those asylum seekers being fast-tracked, as you've  mentioned before wanting to fast-track through the processing, I guess, process [laughs]? Is  that happening in - on Christmas Island? 

 CHRIS EVANS: Fast-track's probably not the right word. They are being given the  normal health, security and identity checks. They are mandatorily detained in Christmas  Island until those checks are completed. If they then make application for protection, they go  through the established processes.  

 If you're asking me, do we leave people rotting on Nauru and deny them legal process, no, we  changed that.  

 But they are assessed as to whether or not they are owed Australia's protection under  international law. If they are owed our protection, then they're granted that and re-settled in  Australia. 

 If they're not owed our protection, we seek to return them to the country of origin. Those are  our obligations under international law, and we meet those obligations. 

 QUESTION: But can you confirm whether they are in fact asylum seekers? Have they been -  been asked [indistinct]? 

 CHRIS EVANS: Well, the very purpose of the last answer was to say that the processes  will determine whether they're asylum seekers, and as yet they haven't been identified and  interviewed. If those processes are completed, then they may seek asylum. 

 But obviously there are issues about getting interpreters to the island, establishing what  language they speak, et cetera. So, those things take a while. But the initial interviews will  continue, then people will indicate whether they want to seek asylum and then those processes  flow from that. 

 QUESTION: So is there anything you can tell us about why they came to Australia and  perhaps why - or tried to come to Australia - and perhaps why they came right up to the jetty  at Christmas Island, they had a GPS navigation [indistinct]? 

 CHRIS EVANS: What I can say is that we haven't finished interviewing them yet, so I  can't give you details about their motivations.  But previous boat arrivals over the years have  been from people seeking an asylum in this country, so it's not unreasonable to assume that  the latest boat arrivals would also be seeking asylum.  

 In terms of their transportation, the reality is there are more sophisticated means of people  smuggling occurring and one of the things we've found is some of these.  Some of these boats  have been of better quality and had slightly larger numbers than those that arrived say, last  year. And particular, one of the departures from Sri Lanka last year had quite sophisticated  positioning equipment et cetera.  

 But clearly, as Mr Debus indicated, it's a shorter trip to Christmas Island for those departing  from some departure points in Indonesia, than say to head for Ashmore Reef. So we've had 

 

  12

 over the years boats head for both Christmas Island and Ashmore Reef; there's nothing  particularly unusual, other than, as you say, this boat was able to get into Christmas Island  near the jetty before being detected.  

 But, as I say, we've had arrivals in the past that have sought to land at Christmas Island. 

 QUESTION: You talk about how the aim is to get them to keep away from the mainland, but  [indistinct] on Christmas Island are saying that they - their island should be used for this  purpose and they're quite frustrated by the recent arrivals and given that it's [indistinct] island,  what would you say to [indistinct]? 

 CHRIS EVANS: I think you ought not take the views of one person being reported as  being the views of Christmas Island. So, that's the first point I make, I'm sure there's a  diversity of opinion.  

 But I've been to Christmas Island and met with community leaders in recent times and they  understand the processes, they understand why we're using the detention facilities on  Christmas Island. And to be frank, many of them appreciate that it's the largest economic  activity, apart from the mine, occurring on the island,and you'll have many Christmas  Islanders tell you that they appreciate the fact that there is that economic activity on the  island. 

 So, certainly the islanders have concerns which we seek to address and we stay in close  contact with them about any community concerns.  But it is also the case that many of them  recognise that there's increased economic activity on the island as a result of the detention. 

 And as you know, Christmas Island has been used for detention purposes for unauthorised  arrivals for many years, and the previous Howard Government spent the only large  investment on detention facilities - $400 million - on the facility at Christmas Island; that's 

 where the big investment in detention was made and that's where our major capacity now  resides. 

 CONVENER: Last questions, thanks. 

 STEPHEN SMITH: Are you right? Otherwise we'll miss the plane. Thanks very much. 

 CHRIS EVANS: Thanks you. Cheers. 

 BOB DEBUS: Cheers. Thanks.
