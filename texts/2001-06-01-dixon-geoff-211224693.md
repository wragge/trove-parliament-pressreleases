  QANTAS: FACING THE FUTURE

  

  ADDRESS BY CEO GEOFF DIXON

  

   

  

  Introduction

  

  Australians are accustomed to thinking of Qantas as an enduring national 
icon. In our Australian psyche, Qantas is a bit like the Melbourne Cup, 
the kangaroo or Bondi Beach. Even a bit like Norman Lindsay’s ever-bountiful 
magic pudding, as I shall come back to shortly.

  

  This sense of national ownership is inspiring and somewhat humbling 
for those of us in leadership roles at Qantas. It heightens our sense 
of stewardship. It strengthens our sense of responsibility to protect 
the value of the Qantas brand and maintain our high level of service. 
And it increases our determination to secure a strong and viable future 
for Qantas.

  

  It’s the longer term issues and challenges facing Qantas that I 
want to address today. The aviation industry is globalising -- and at 
an accelerating pace. Powerful forces will inexorably drive significant 
changes in the aviation industry over the next five years. Qantas is 
making the right moves to succeed, but we confront some stark realities 
which Australian governments of all persuasions, regulatory authorities, 
the labour movement, and our own people need to be aware of and respond 
to.

  

  Today I want to outline some of the circumstances which have brought 
Qantas to its current position in Australian national life, and show 
how this unique history has contributed to complex --and sometimes contradictory 
-expectations of Qantas.

  

  I want to point out the forces of change which we confront and outline 
how we are dealing with them.

  

  And I particularly want to argue that a number of regulatory and legislative 
constraints are limiting Qantas’ capacity to compete effectively in 
the future. They were no doubt formulated with the best of intentions. 
But, if left unchanged, these constraints could lead to unintended but 
severe negative consequences for Qantas. They could render the airline 
unnecessarily vulnerable at a time of intense global change.

  

  Outdated constraints must be lifted to allow Qantas the maximum chances 
of global success, just as our whole nation must continuously adapt 
to the new global realities.

  

  History

  

  When it comes to business matters, we all like to think we are perfectly 
rational and impartial. But the reality is that current expectations 
of Qantas are deeply affected by the emotional legacy of this company’s 
history.

  

  National icon

  

  Australia’s Qantas is one of the oldest airlines 
in the world. We celebrated 80 years of operations last year. The company’s 
success has always relied upon innovation and operational excellence. 
In fact, aviation excellence is part of our national register of expertise, 
along with mining and farming. In 1958 Qantas was the first airline 
to fly around the world with the Super Constellation. Qantas has twice 
won the prestigious Cumberbatch Trophy for engineering excellence - 
an award no other airline in the world has ever won twice. Qantas flew 
the first non-stop 747-400 flight from UK to Australia in 1989, establishing 
a new world distance record for a commercial aircraft. Qantas was the 
airline that conceived and introduced business class travel to a grateful 
global business community.

  

  I do not think it is too strong a statement to 
say that Qantas today is treasured by Australians. We were voted the 
Australian company with the best corporate image in Australia every 
year for 11 consecutive years in a poll conducted by Australia’s National 
Business Bulletin. For most Australians, an Australian future without 
Qantas is unthinkable.

  

  International flag carrier

  

  Qantas was founded by entrepreneurs and acquired 
by the Commonwealth in 1947. Since then the company has played a key 
role in national life. Qantas capabilities are still factored into national 
emergency and defence planning. When Cyclone Tracy hit Darwin in 1974, 
Qantas rescued almost five thousand Darwin residents. When the Australian 
Government evacuated Kosovo refugees from the Balkans, Qantas was the 
carrier. When Governments initiated trading relationships with particular 
markets, Qantas was expected to fly the route -- and the flag-- for 
Australia. Governments, both Federal and State, became accustomed to 
thinking of Qantas as a willing partner in their international tourism, 
trade and defence strategies.

  

  Qantas’ special flag-flying role has been most 
vividly reflected in its staff relations. Qantas staff have always considered 
themselves to be proud representatives of Australia in the world. I 
can think of no other Australian company that devotes an A3-sized page 
in its monthly staff newsletter to milestones of tenure. In May’s 
edition alone we had 25 people who celebrated 25 or more years of service 
with Qantas. This legitimate pride has also been associated with expectations 
that Qantas will remain a very special Australian employer.

  

  Government enterprise

  

  Under Government ownership and within the domestic 
aviation duopoly with Ansett, Qantas (including Australian Airlines 
before the merger) was constrained in its ability to raise shareholders’ 
funds. The aim of privatisation and more competition was simple: to 
relieve taxpayers from the requirement to invest capital in a business 
enterprise; to allow Qantas to compete effectively on a global basis; 
and to give consumers a better deal. But despite the seven years since 
privatisation, there are some lingering perceptions of Qantas as rich 
and padded, disguising its real strength, and ruthlessly exercising 
its market power.

  

  Today

  

  In fact, of course, privatisation has made Qantas 
a leaner, more productive and more effective company. We rode out the 
Asian crisis very well. We have delivered record profits each year since 
privatisation. But this year we have issued a profit warning as a result 
of a slowing economy, increased domestic price competition, higher fuel 
prices, exchange rate costs and increased airport charges. We are managing 
these issues and I don’t propose to talk about them specifically in 
these remarks, although I am happy to answer any questions. But they 
form part of the bigger picture that is cause for concern.

  

  Globalisation

  

  Two key trends are accelerating the globalisation 
process as it affects aviation: the progressive deregulation and liberalisation 
of government policies, and the drive for economies of scale and scope 
by airlines themselves. The aviation industry is already one of the 
toughest around. This industry operates on thin margins - and when 
I say thin, I mean skinny. According to the International Air Transport 
Association, overall industry profits are expected to average a mere 
1.1% of revenues in 2000 and 2001.

  

  The average consumer of scheduled services is 
paying 70% less in real terms than 20 years ago. Last year average fares 
fell by 3.1%, but unit costs declined by only 0.3%.

  

  And airlines are doing it tough. Of the close 
to 300 airlines around the world, many are making losses and most are 
experiencing diminishing profitability.

  

  The global situation was recently summed up by 
International Air Transport Association Director-General, Pierre Jeanniot. 
Jeanniot suggested that for many of the world’s airlines - those 
with a small domestic market base, who were unable to achieve critical 
mass because of bilateral treaty limitations and foreign ownership rules 
- the long term chances of survival were diminishing.

  

  Noting that the drive to further cost reduction 
was leading the aviation industry towards greater consolidation, Jeanniot 
went on to observe: "And thus we are witnessing some strange situations 
whereby some airlines are considered ‘too large to merge… but at 
the same time, too small not to merge!’ too big in their domestic 
market, too small for the international arena."

  

  That was a message which struck home around Qantas 
corridors.

  

  There is no doubt that success in the coming years 
is going to depend, not just on superior service and cost-efficiency, 
but on developing strong economies of scale and scope. For Qantas, this 
is the emerging strategic imperative.

  

  Qantas is not big enough to take on the world 
alone. Qantas is the 12th largest airline in the world based on revenue 
passenger kilometres but the reality is we are only 2.3% of the world 
market. We have no option but to continue to forge international alliances.

  

  But with 53% of the Australian market, Qantas 
is viewed as the market gorilla. We are seen to be so substantial domestically 
that people fail to recognise the global challenges we confront. Today, 
our share of international traffic to and from Australia stands at around 
33% - down from 40% five years ago.

  

  These figures are not dominant when we look at 
the positions held in their own market by carriers such as Air New Zealand 
(over 70% nationally and around 55% internationally), Singapore Airlines 
(around 50% internationally), Lufthansa (78% domestic and around 40% 
internationally), Air France (75% domestic and around 40% internationally) 
and Air Canada (73% domestic and nearly 50% internationally).

  

  The bottom line is that our icon status in Australia 
is leading people to block the global future that will secure our success.

  

  The magic pudding

  

  I began by noting that attitudes to Qantas are 
reminiscent of the storybook magic pudding - no matter how much you 
eat away at it, there’s always plenty left.

  

  Here’s an example of the magic pudding mentality 
in action. When Australia welcomed new aviation start-ups last year, 
State and Territory governments provided generous -- and often non-transparent 
-- financial incentives to the new players. You would have seen images 
of political leaders shaking hands with entrepreneurs, beaming as they 
promised voters an abundance of cheap seats. Fair enough. Yet some of 
these same people were among the loudest protesters when Qantas announced 
its decision to withdraw services from China, a route on which we had 
accumulated losses in excess of $30 million. They argued that Qantas 
was sending a signal of national indifference to trade with China.

  

  In other words, State Governments were prepared 
to erode Qantas’ profitability by assisting start-up carriers. But 
they still expected Qantas to subsidise loss making routes internationally 
in the national interest. These contradictory positions vividly reflect 
our history.

  

  I want to expand on the legacy problem and identify 
some immediate and longer term solutions. I also want to set out how 
Qantas is approaching its strategic challenges for a strong and viable 
future.

  

  Legacy of view of national icon

  

  The most powerful legacy of our national icon 
status is the restriction on foreign share ownership. This was put in 
place for two reasons. Firstly, it was a symbolic act by Government 
in recognition of Qantas’ strong and enduring place in Australian 
life. And secondly, it was to reinforce Qantas as a carrier substantially 
owned and effectively controlled by Australian nationals for the purposes 
of bilateral treaty requirements.

  

  We are calling for the ownership restriction to 
be lifted. Qantas would not suddenly be prey to foreign takeover. We 
would be subject to the same foreign investment screening processes 
that the Government recently used to block the take-over of Woodside 
by Shell.

  

  Emphasis on substantial national ownership is 
receding. The principle increasingly being applied is whether the airline 
is effectively controlled by nationals, and where it locates its business 
base. We would not risk Qantas losing its valuable Australian carrier 
status.

  

  Unblocking the shareholder restriction would give 
Qantas greater flexibility to manage its destiny. A current example 
would be the better access such a move would give us to global capital 
markets to assist in the funding of our $10 billion fleet acquisition 
program. Retaining the restriction will have the unintended consequence 
of weakening Qantas. Ironically, rather than strengthening us, it will 
make us more vulnerable in a tough international environment.

  

  Legacy of the fat government enterprise image

  

  The image of Qantas as a "padded government 
enterprise" is another part of our legacy, lingering in some regulatory 
circles. The reality of course, is that Qantas is a wholly commercial 
entity and we welcome competition. The forces of globalisation have 
brought home to us that the whole world is our market, and we thrive 
or fail on our global performance.

  

  But, in many overseas markets, particularly in 
Asia, competition policy regulation is virtually unknown. Our most powerful 
competitors are aggressively government backed and substantially government 
owned. That includes Singapore Airlines, and also Malaysia Airlines, 
Thai Airways and Emirates, all of which act as virtual arms of their 
governments and actively promote national interest. Unlike some of them, 
we have to earn a return for Shareholders and we   can   go broke!

  

  While the complexities 
of the international aviation market make rational policy settings extremely 
difficult, and Qantas acknowledges much support from successive federal 
governments, the contradictions that sometimes arise in Australian policy 
approaches can be particularly frustrating. As Qantas faces intense 
global competition, confronting powerful, government-owned or supported 
competitors, many in Australia are taking a purely national view of 
competition policy and regulation. We can’t succeed if Australia’s 
liberal approach to aviation policy continues to create opportunities 
for competitors who operate from a background of more robust Government 
involvement in their activities while at the same limiting Qantas’ 
capacity to respond competitively.

  

  Take some examples:

  

  Australia opened its domestic 
market to airlines 100% foreign-owned. Few other nations would do this 
- certainly not those in UK/Europe or North America. Clearly this decision 
was made with consumers in mind, which was entirely understandable. 
But, in an industry with wafer thin margins, this type of action has 
the effect, not only of driving down the profitability of Qantas, but 
also of weakening the long term viability of the whole industry.

  

  Or consider this. When 
Qantas recently had the first opportunity in more than a decade to obtain 
new runway capacity at Tokyo’s Narita airport, the regulator prevented 
it. It argued that Qantas’ capacity share of the Tokyo market would 
increase at the expense of Ansett International. In other words, the 
regulator was using national competition considerations to disadvantage 
Qantas in one of our key international markets.

  

  A third example. We now 
understand that, under changes mooted by the Australian Taxation Office, 
we will face lower depreciation deductions on our $10 billion fleet 
upgrade that have the potential to increase our tax liability and therefore 
weaken our international competitive position.

  

  All these decisions are 
justifiable if you assume Qantas is a magic pudding with endless reserves. 
In fact, they are eating away at Qantas’ long term viability.

  

  A few words on the Australian 
Competition and Consumer Commission. The ACCC performs an important 
role. But, we need to remember that it has some of the broadest powers 
of any international competition regulator, and we find it hard to digest 
Professor Fels’ recent suggestion that he be given still wider powers.

  

  Qantas has cooperated closely 
with the Commission in all matters brought before it by both Impulse 
and Virgin Blue, who wanted the playing field skewed in their favour 
even before they had taken to the air.

  

  As repeated claims by the 
new entrants have never resulted in findings of anti-competitive behaviour 
by Qantas, some people may be wondering why we would be concerned to 
see the Commission’s powers extended. Let me explain.

  

  In addition to its current 
- and quite appropriate - power to act in cases where companies have 
the purpose of engaging in anti-competitive behaviour, the Commission 
would gain (if reports we have seen are correct) the ability to intervene 
in circumstances where even legitimate actions had the effect of lessening 
competition. As I see it, Professor Fels is seeking the ability to engage 
in a form of "social engineering". It would become the dominant 
player in the market - a market in which we have established a strong 
position, not on the basis of special privilege or preference, and certainly 
not anti-competitive behaviour, but by dint of hard work, significant 
investment and increased efficiency.

  

  We therefore concur with 
National Competition Council Chairman Graeme Samuel who is reported 
to have urged caution, saying, "We have to be very careful we don’t 
go so far as to prevent dominant players engaging in normal competitive 
behaviour by using efficiencies they get through economies of scale."

  

  And we should not lose 
sight of the fact that, unless it is profitable, this capital intensive 
industry will be unable to generate the funds required to invest and 
grow on a long term viable basis.

  

  Legacy of that foreign 
policy role

  

  I have mentioned the legacies 
of our government enterprise status and our national icon role. Let 
me quickly highlight the continuing impact of our status as international 
flag carrier for Australia.

  

  There was loud criticism 
when Qantas announced it was withdrawing from China, just as there was 
a few years ago when we withdrew from Seoul. But these decisions were 
taken in the prudent interests of our shareholders and our long term 
future. Clearly there is residual belief that Qantas should subsidise 
Australia’s international agendas. Now there is no question that Qantas 
is a national team player - our future is in a strong Australian economy 
and society and we want to be supportive. We take great pleasure and 
pride in an active community service role. But we would simply be irresponsible 
if we continued to undertake these major loss-making activities without 
proper consideration of the longer term impact on our business.

  

  Another legacy of our flag 
carrier status is more subtle. There is still a belief around that Qantas, 
unlike other international Australian companies, should only employ 
Australians, and only in Australia. Fully 94% of our staff are employed 
in Australia, under premium working conditions.

  

  Within Australia, Impulse 
and Virgin Blue were able to establish green-fields operations on the 
basis of more competitive working conditions not available to Qantas. 
Fair enough. But, in the longer term, for Qantas to continue to be competitive, 
we need the labour movement to accept the realities of our present and 
future circumstances, which could mean us having to employ more people 
off-shore as befits our position as probably Australia’s most international 
company.

  

  Qantas reaction

  

  As we go forward there 
are two options for Qantas -to become an active global player or to 
become a passive victim of powerful global forces. We want to be an 
active global player, on the forefront of activity. And we are taking 
the steps to succeed.

  

  â¢   We announced a $10 billion 
fleet acquisition program for the next 10 years, one of the largest 
capital acquisition programs ever announced by any Australian institution, 
public or private.  

  

  â¢   We are aggressively pursuing 
wide ranging bilateral and global alliance arrangements with our cornerstone 
investor British Airways and other   one  world 
partners.  

  

  â¢   We are particularly focused 
on the opportunity to establish a partnership with Air New Zealand which 
would strengthen the international competitiveness of both airlines 
and improve   Australasia’s   future in the global aviation 
industry. And if that is not to be the case, we will ensure that Qantas 
has a strong competitive presence in the New Zealand domestic market.  

  

  â¢   We are looking to further 
redesign our domestic business to meet the new challenges.  

  

  â¢   We are also looking at 
starting a new low cost international airline to fly to markets from 
which Qantas, in its current form, is unable to generate an acceptable 
return.  

  

  So we are positively and 
aggressively making our way in the national and international markets.

  

  Conclusion

  

  Let me conclude. Any stocktake 
or reality check must recognise that Qantas - which, by international 
airline standards, has been quite profitable - has a number of important 
assets. These include our widely respected brand, our reputation for 
operational excellence, strong domestic market position, our skilled 
staff, a loyal customer base and wide ranging bilateral and global alliance 
arrangements with British Airways and other   one  world 
partners.

  

  But there are elements 
deciding the future of Qantas that are beyond our control. This is where 
Governments, regulators, the labour movement and, indeed, the Australian 
public need to join with us in confronting the global realities that 
Qantas managers face every day.

  

  We must have national approaches 
that accept Qantas is operating in a highly competitive global industry 
where special circumstances, such as Government ownership and direction 
of key players, and significant protection for those players, distort 
outcomes.

  

  As a nation, our competition 
policy, regulation, and ideas about ownership must give more account 
to international realities. Government policy settings must move swiftly 
to take account of the challenges we face internationally, and the strategic 
agendas of our competitors. If Australia can make the transition to 
accepting global competition and market realities, then Qantas, and 
Australia, have a strong future.

  

  If not, then we at Qantas 
cannot rule out an unwelcome future in which Qantas becomes increasingly 
vulnerable to the forces of globalisation.

  

  At Qantas, we aspire, not 
to preservation in the aspic of the past, but a dynamic place in Australia’s 
global future. That’s how we can best serve our customers. It’s 
how we can nurture the Australian aviation industry. It’s the basis 
for viably employing tens of thousands of Australians. And it’s how 
we can continue to be a treasured part of Australian national life - 
for today, tomorrow and future Australian generations.
