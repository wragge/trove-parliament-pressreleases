 Labor's Secret Plans to Abolish Border Protection Laws Revealed by Labor Candidate 3rd November 2001

 The Opposition Leader, Kim Beazley, must immediately disendorse his Labor candidate for the seat of New England over comments she has made on illegal immigrants - or admit that his policy in government would be to overturn the Howard-Anderson Government's border protection laws.

 "This is an absolute test of Mr Beazley's leadership and his so-called commitment to the Government's tough stance on queue jumpers," the Leader of the National Party, John Anderson, said today.

 "The choice is simple. Either he does the right thing and disendorses this candidate, or his flip-flopping stance in supporting the Government's border protection laws will be confirmed as a complete sham."

 Labor's candidate for the seat of New England, Annette McCarthy, let the cat out of the Beazley bag when she told regional ABC radio that she opposed everything the Government was doing on border security.

 Ms McCarthy also made the bizarre claim that the world was "mutually to blame" for the horrific September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States - echoing equally ridiculous assertions by Labor's candidate for Gilmore, Peter Knott.

 Interviewed by Briony Petch on ABC radio in Tamworth on Friday, Ms McCarthy said:

 "I was actually literally flying back from Indonesia when I read in the Jakarta Post what was happening to these poor boat people. And I was actually absolutely ashamed to be an Australian and certainly the Australian Labor Party does not, for one minute, agree with the way that the Opposition is handling this terrible, terrible plight of human beings."

 Whether Ms McCarthy really meant that she was opposed to what the "Opposition" or the "Government" was doing is moot. Mr Beazley has tried to paint himself as the tough guy on border protection, as the leader who would have followed the same path as the Howard-Anderson Government has followed - not for just one minute, but all day, every day.

 But Ms McCarthy did not finish there. She then tried to claim that the Government planned to put boatpeople on Easter Island and then revealed the Beazley plan:

 "When Beazley gets into government, Beazley wants … one and for all is a humanitarian person. Labor stands for humanitarian principles and we would not stand by and see people treated in such a despicable manner."

 Ms McCarthy was then asked if she felt the United States was to blame for the events of September 11.

 "No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying we're all mutually to blame. I mean, how can …I mean, once again, this is Labor policy. How can one section of our community have it all, and other sections have very little and have nothing?

 I mean, I think for sure there's certain sanctions that are to be placed on certain countries that have caused incredible hardship. And with hardship, that is the breeding ground for terrorism."

 The suggestion that 'we're all mutually to blame' for the actions of 19 terrorists, supported by a shadowy network of hatred-driven fanatics, is simplistic in the extreme when those actions saw the deaths of thousands of innocents as they went about their daily work.

 "Will Mr Beazley stand up and be counted on this issue? Who does he support - his candidate or the Government's legislation? His actions over the next 24 hours will be very telling indeed."
