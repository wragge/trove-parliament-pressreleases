 Howard Government Must Condemn Hanson On Aid To Indonesia Laurie Brereton - Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs

 Media Statement - 15 February 2001

 The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laurie Brereton, today called on the Howard Government to condemn Pauline Hanson's attack on Australia's aid to Indonesia.

 "The idea that Australia should cancel our humanitarian and development assistance to Indonesia is a classic example of cheap and shallow populism", Mr Brereton said.

 "If ever implemented, such a policy would have a disastrous impact on our national interest and relations with our closest Asian neighbour."

 "The Howard Government must categorically reject this xenophobic absurdity."

 "Australia's aid to Indonesia plays a critical part in international efforts to help Indonesia deal with its immense humanitarian and development challenges."

 "Approximately 110 million Indonesians are living on incomes of less than $US 2 a day, overall per capita income is little more than half that of four years ago. Internal conflicts and turmoil in Indonesia have already generated more than 300,000 internally displaced persons."

 "Pauline Hanson would be the first to complain if rising levels of economic and social distress in Indonesia generated a flow of refugees to northern Australia."

 "The Howard Government's deep equivocation toward Pauline Hanson's One Nation has the potential to inflict further severe damage on Australia's relations with Asia including Indonesia."

 "Trade Minister and Deputy National Party Leader Mark Vaile earlier this week refused to rule out giving electoral preferences to One Nation. Mr Vaile is today meeting senior Indonesian government and business figures in Jakarta. Any efforts by him to advance our bilateral relationship and trading interests will lack all credibility if he and the Howard Government do not categorically reject One Nation."
