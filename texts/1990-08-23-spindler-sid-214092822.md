 MEDIA RELEASE

 PARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIA ·  THE SENATE

 EXPERIENCE OF WAR PROVIDES BASIS FOR SOCIAL REFORM

 Australian Democrat Senator Sid Spindler has cited the horrors  of the Second World War as one of his basic formative 

 experiences.

 Speaking during his First Speech last night, Senator Spindler  described his experiences as a young refugee, trapped between the  advancing Soviet armies and the retreating German forces and  traced his own political vision back to that time.

 "In the years following the war," Senator Spindler said, "My hazy  and fragmented childhood memories coalesced into a conscious  realisation of the enormity of the holocaust.It was this, even  more than my personal experiences on the refugee trek which 

 shaped my determination to work for peace."

 Senator Spindler went on to condemn the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait  but criticised the sending of Australian warships to the Gulf as  an inappropriate response. "Of course, we should respond  positively to a U.N. request to participate in a peace keeping 

 force but Australia must stop the juvenile quest to compete with  the 'big boys' in the sabre-rattling stakes, " Senator Spindler  said. ,

 Senator Spindler claimed that the excessive spending on military  ventures was depriving the nation of funds which were urgently  needed to enhance the environment and develop a socially just  economy.

 "We welcome the challenge of representing people and issues  disregarded by the other parties.  Our Alternative Budget  Proposals have shown that our policies are costed and 

 economically feasible and that a sustainable and just society is  possible," Senator Spindler said, "this is in stark contrast to  the old parties who now are indistinguishable in their disregard  for the interests of ordinary citizens"

 "Increasingly, people striving for a society committed to  justice, peace and an environmentally sustainable economy will  be turning to the Democrats as their only parliamentary 

 advocates," Senator Spindler concluded.

 FIRST SPEECH

 One's vision of the future is bound to be an intensely personal  one, built up over time and fashioned by a multitude of factors.

 My own is based on the 'she' society - sane, humane, ecological.  Such a society is achievable and we in this place, have the task  to bring it about.

 However, one cannot move into the future without taking stock of  the past and analysing the present.

 If I were asked to identify Australia's most significant  achievement I would not hesitate to nominate the essentially  cohesive and harmonious multicultural society which is evolving  daily with contributions from people who came here from 140  different countries.

 Without a doubt the essential basis for this multicultural  society is the innate respect Australians have for individuals  and for people who are different.

 This civilized tolerance stands in stark contrast to my childhood  experiences in war-torn Europe.  Somewhat parallel to the  reaction of an adopted child I can now confirm that while most  of you were fortunate to have been born here, I chose well when 

 I came here as a 17 year old migrant in 1949.

 -1 was born of German parents in a part of Poland which belonged  to Russia when they were born there. During those two or three  generations, ethnic differences often became a matter of life or  death.

 The beginnings were peaceful enough. In an early example of  skills migration the then King of Poland contracted several  hundred German spinners and weavers including my forbears to come  to what later became the city of Lodz to establish a textile 

 industry. It is a matter of great pleasure that a boyhood friend  and member of one of that area's great textile families, Norbert  Bernecker, is able to be here today.

 I was seven when the German armies invaded Poland. Towards the  end of the war I became part of the refugee trek zigzagging  westward between the advancing Soviet and retreating German  troops.  Seventeen schoolboys,  a small proportion of the original 

 contingent finally came to rest north of Berlin and, after  finding my parents, I lived in Saxony, which became part of the  Soviet zone of occupation.

 During that time the jigsaw puzzle of hazy and fragmented  childhood memories came together into a conscious realization of  the enormity of the holocaust. It was this, more even than the  personal experience of destruction and casualties in the refugee  trek, which shaped then and informs now my determination to work 

 for peace in its most basic sense - the development of an ethos  between nations and between individuals which rejects violence  as a means of conflict resolution.

 Hence my long and continuing involvement in the Australian  peace movement and my support for a defence posture which is  genuinely defensive. Australia needs weapons and equipment to  defend its shoreline, rather than long range aircraft and naval  vessels on the assumption that we will rush into every conflict 

 far from our shores. In the Middle East it is clear that Saddam  Hussein must be stopped. However, the correct level of response  for Australia is support for the United Nations economic boycott  and a contribution of personnel to a peace-keeping force if 

 requested by the United Nations.

 Such a request should go before both Houses of Parliament where  in this instance it should receive unanimous support.

 Australia must turn away from the juvenile quest to compete in  the sabre-rattling stakes, withdrawing badly needed funds which  should be used for health, education and community development.   Equally reprehensible is the continuing build up of our armaments 

 industry which is making us the weapons dealer of the Pacific.

 We need to build economic, cultural and social ties with the  other nations in the Pacific and we need to integrate our armed  forces with the economic and social development of the nation by  giving them a role in natural disaster work and in the building  of bridges, roads, railways and other infrastructure.

 This philosophy has found expression in the Democrats' 

 Alternative Budget Proposals published last week, in a proposed  reduction of $798 million in armaments expenditure and an  increase of $430 million in overseas aid, a continuing boost for  our export trade, and an additional $477 million for education  employment and training.

 My early days in Europe are also responsible for my suspicion of  chauvinistic prejudice masquerading as patriotism and for my  intense opposition to all forms of totalitarian compulsion.

 No sooner had the simplistic propaganda of Nazism been exposed  before our very eyes as a corrupt sham hiding horrendous crimes,  when the Iron Curtain descended and a new indoctrination attempt  got under way - but not before we had been given a glimpse of the 

 liberating notion of democracy when we attended school during the  brief American occupation.

 The first few years in Australia when I came here at 17, rivealed  the significant extent to which a democratic, pluralist society  mirrors the aspirations, both noble and crass, of its citizens.   For the first time in years I could breathe freely and did what  most migrants do - worked hard to get an economic foothold in 

 this new country where such aspirations made sense. :

 I had the good fortune to meet and marry a woman of exceptional  quality. It was her selfless support and her commitment to our  splendid children, Karen, Christopher, Linden and Rebecca·, which  enabled me to build a business and to pursue concurrently studies 

 in law, business administration and political science, and later  to become involved in politics.

 It is a matter of profound regret to me that these pressures led  to a separation and that Julia is not here today.

 My entry into politics was through the Australia Party where I  took over from Dr David Smith as Victorian Convenor, and my first  contact with Don Chipp was in 1972 when I called on him with a  friend suggesting he should take a leading role in the Party.

 This finally occurred in 1977 when the Australian Democrats were  formed to challenge the two Party system. !

 I welcome the opportunity to pay tribute to both Don Chipp  and Janine Haines who, as Party Leaders, articulated so well the  message of social and political reform in the face !  of the  converging policies of the old Parties.

 I became Senior Advisor to Don Chipp in 1981 and later moved into  the same position with Senator Janine Haines. â 

 My work included policy development and liaison between the  Senate team and the Party organisation, and here a tribute is due  to the scores of committed members who work day in and day out  to achieve a better future for Australia. Janet Powell;, Sam  Hudson, Heather Southcott are just a few whose work in those days  ensured the survival and growth of the Party and still continues 

 to do so today.

 But before that, there was a year at the Alice Springs Community  College and a Youth Needs Survey for the Northern Territory  Government. Both involved work with Aboriginal communities and  this experience has given me an abiding respect and affection for  Aboriginal people. More than that, it has generated a strong and 

 continuing interest in their quest for justice and a place in our  community which takes account of their cultural and spiritual  heritage which can and should enrich our own.

 United Nations consultancies in Tonga and Wester'n Samoa  reinforced my strongly held view that we must adopt a global  approach to the challenges facing Australia today and that we  must share resources and knowledge with Third World countries as 

 a moral obligation which ultimately equates with enlightened  self-interest.  ’

 Perhaps the most important formative experience was the five  years spent as Administrator of 'ACCESS', the Outer Eastern  Regional Council of Social Development.  It was a funded pilot  region under the Australian Assistance Plan and the task to 

 establish a decision-making process which the community could use  to allocate funds to community projects, was a practical and  exhilarating experience in effective participatory democracy.  It reinforced similar experiences in the Australia Party and in  the Australian Democrats where it is one of the major factors in  ensuring the Party's survival and growth. Clearly members who  are able to exercise direct influence over the values, policies  and direction of the Party will bring much greater commitment to  the task and make a much more active contribution than members  who are simply told what the policies are, or worse, who find 

 their values betrayed by the leadership.

 However,  the significance of effective participation goes much  further than that. Writing some fifteen years ago, Carole  Pateman demonstrated in "Participation and Democratic Theory"  that effective participation is an educative process, leading not  only to greater personal autonomy but also to increased concern 

 for the common good.

 A nominally democratic system will not necessarily realise its  potential as Schumpeter showed when he characterised a 

 'democracy' as a model where two elites compete for the support  of an apathetic mass.

 Australians have been suffering from the dead hand of such a two  Party system for decades.  It is bad enough when Members on either side are forced into the ritual of meaningless 

 confrontation and the systematic denial of their intellectual and  moral integrity. It is little short of a disaster for the  country when both Parties adopt policy positions which coincide  in their disregard for social and economic justice and a 

 sustainable future for all Australians.

 In years to come, the contribution the Democrats are making in  changing this stultifying system into an open participatory  process, will be seen at least as important as the growing list  of successful amendments and the increasing number of reform  groups who acknowledge the Democrats as their parliamentary  representatives.

 The Democrats have now been recognised as the Party offering a  vision for an alternative future. It is a vision for a

 Sustainable Society based on Social Equity, Environmental  Sustainability, Economic Sovereignty, Democratic Control and  International Responsibility.

 To pursue such a vision people must have hope, hope that is  grounded in the belief that it is possible to realize that vision  or at least to move towards it.

 In 1986 I had a hand in drafting a Notice of Motion which  listed a range of urgent social justice measures.  When Senator  Janet Powell moved it, that motion earned us the tag 'the fairies  at the bottom of the garden'  - something of a badge of honour  since the light on the top of the hill has grown very dim indeed.

 In 1990/91 the Democrats' Alternative Budget Proposals are the  first step in a continuing process not only to cost policy  priorities but also to show 'where the money is coming from'.  The proposals indicate a direction rather' than a complete  prescription and do not include all the additional measures the  Democrats would fund nor all the additional revenue options we  would like to see pursued. However it is urgent to make a start 

 and while many of the alternative budget proposals are starting  points only, further action will follow in subsequent budget  years.

 In the macro-economic context, they offer an alternative strategy  to the Treasurer's high interest regime, which has hit families  trying to buy a home and squeezed small business to  within an inch of its life.

 However, in turning to fiscal measures the Democrats reject the  only strategy Mr Keating and Dr Hewson can conceive, and one that  has been continued in this budget, - further cuts to badly needed  health, education and welfare services. Instead we have shown  that a surplus can be achieved not by cutting services but by  making tax avoiders pay their fair share of tax just as PAYE 

 taxpayers d o .  We have proposed a range of measures which will  make our tax system more effective and more progressive, will  advance social objectives and raise more revenue.

 Expenditure on community services is increased by $4  billion, while revenue is increased by $7.1 billion, yielding a  potential additional surplus of $3.1 billion, opening the way for  an accelerated reduction in interest rates and a lower exchange 

 rate for our dollar'to boost exports and reduce imports.

 We have included Landcare, Forestry, Energy Conservation, Habitat  Restoration and other conservation programs essential for  a genuinely sustainable future.  But this is not going to be  achieved unless we enable all Australians to meet their basic  needs and to participate fully in the social and political life  of the nation.

 Accordingly, we have proposed to increase and extend Young  Homeless and Disability Allowances, to provide concessional  benefits for all pensioners with an income below $15,000 and to  double the funding for Grant-in-Aid workers for ethnic 

 communities - all of them neglected in the Treasurer's Budget.

 But while the Democrats advocate these and other urgent remedial  measures to lift people out of poverty, we do not ask for 

 institutionalised charity. Australian citizens are entitled to  a level playing field but this time not just for large 

 corporations, but for ordinary Australians.

 Hence there are increased resources and powers for the Foreign  Investment Review Board, the Trade Practices Commission, the  Prices Surveillance Authority and the Bureau of Consumer Affairs.

 There is additional funding to ensure local content programming  at the ABC and to protect the SBS from commercialisation.

 There is increased funding for Legal Aid and more judges to  make access to the law a reality. There is also a strong boost  for public transport and a truly national railway system to be  financed by higher excise on petrol and diesel fuel and 

 a road freight levy.

 I was pleased by two headlines which identify correctly the  thrust of the Democrats Budget Proposals: In the Melbourne 'Age', 'Democrats Propose Tax-avoidance Crackdown in Alternative  Budget'  , and in the Ballarat 'Courier' , Democrats Aim to Tax Rich  to Help Poor'.

 In essence, it is a choice between allowing tax rorts to 

 continue, maintaining low prices for health damaging products and  allowing so called entrepreneurs to rip off Australian families,  or turning our country around with better research, better  transport, an efficient and well supervised financial system,  better education and a fair deal for homeless and unemployed  people, pensioners and children in poverty.

 I know the choice which should be made, and look forward to  working with you towards achieving these goals.
