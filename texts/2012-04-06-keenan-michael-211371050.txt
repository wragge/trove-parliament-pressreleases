 OVER 250 PEOPLE HAVE ARRIVED ILLEGALLY IN JUST  FIVE DAYS UNDER LABOR

 Posted on Friday, 6 April, 2012

 The arrival of the latest illegal boat, with 53 people on board, is the fourth to arrive this week and  means more than 250 people have arrived in just five days as people smugglers continue to ramp up  their business in response to Labor's let then in let them out policy of community release, Shadow  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and  Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 "So far this year the number of people arriving by illegal boat has almost doubled on last year as  people smugglers continue to react to Labor’s capitulation to the Greens on onshore release," Mr  Morrison said.

 "This time last year 804 people had arrived while this year 1,563 people have come over the same  period.

 "Hot off the heels of the biggest summer of boat arrivals on record, people smugglers are sending the  loudest possible message that Labor's failed policies are the best incentive they have ever had," Mr  Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “Another boat, another day of the Gillard Labor Government’s inaction and excuses  on the border protection crisis they created.

 “How desperate does the border protection chaos in our country have to get before the Minister for  Immigration Chris Bowen and the Minister for Home Affairs Jason Clare, actually take the steps to  rectify the situation by reinstating the Coalition’s proven immigration policies that they abolished when  they came to office.

 “It is clear now that the Gillard Government have resigned themselves to the idea of doing nothing but  watch the problem escalate, a resolution that is set to cost the Australian taxpayer billions.

 “With a budget blow-out of almost $4 billion and rising, it is now a case of how much more damage  Labor will do before the Australian people vote them out of office,” Mr Keenan said.
