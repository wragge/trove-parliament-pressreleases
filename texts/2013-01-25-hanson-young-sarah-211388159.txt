 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 25 January 2013   

 More scrutiny required of immigration network  in light of excessive force   

 The sacking of a Serco guard for the use of excessive force against a mentally ill refugee last year is a  sign of the abysmal situation in the government’s onshore and offshore detention centres, the  Australian Greens said today.   

 “If this sort of abuse is going on in our onshore detention network, how can we trust the  government to oversee detention centres on remote Pacific islands?” the Greens immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “I will be travelling to Manus Island next week and plan to inspect the detention facility there so that  the Australian taxpayers, whose billions of dollars have been spent on these offshore prisons, can  understand the conditions there.   

 “Potential abuses of a seriously mentally ill refugee in Australia must be the wake-up call the  Department of Immigration uses to address serious concerns about the training of staff, but I fear  that won’t be the case.   

 “The government has been advised for two years that its practice of training staff in a similar way to  prison guards is unacceptable and a complete overhaul is required, but they have failed to act.   

 “With incidents like these happening in Australian detention centres, it raises serious concerns about  the conditions in offshore centres, out of sight and out of mind.
