 D e s e r t i f i c at i o n   The Inv Is Ible Fron Tl Ine 



 t o fight or to flee? t hese are the stark choices Maria, a single mother from the Bangalala midlands of t anzania, faces repeatedly. Her  choice, along with those of families like hers, are felt all over the world.

 “After the rains failed for a few years, some neighbors claimed our trees were drawing too much water from the ground. We cut them  down. Our harvests fell. My mother closed her stall at the local market. That is when my father and I moved from the midlands to the  Ruvu Mferejini river valley. My brother quit school to help the family. He went to find work but he does not earn enough. My mother  stayed in Bangalala so that my daughter could go to school because there are no schools in the valley. But where we moved to, my  crop also failed last year. That is why early this year I moved yet again, but I left my father behind. I hope to farm here much longer,  as I am sure the people I left behind with my father will have to move too. But when will this moving end? I cannot afford it anymore.”

 t his  is  not  an  isolated  case.  Maria  is  in  the  same  situation  that  women  in  Darfur,  Mali,  chad  or  a fghanistan  were  in  before  local  conflicts over water or land turned into civil wars, sexual violence or genocide. nor is this situation unique to sub- saharan a frica  where half a billion inhabitants are rural, a majority lives off the land and desertification is a constant threat to their livelihoods.  More than 1.5 billion people in the world depend on degrading land,  and 74% of them, like Maria, are poor. Under the United nations  convention to c ombat Desertification (UnccD), the international legal framework for tackling desertification, land degradation and  drought, 169 of its 194 Parties have declared they are affected by desertification.

 Desertification  is  a  silent,  invisible  crisis  that  is  destabilizing  communities  on  a  global  scale.  as  the  effects  of  climate  change   undermine livelihoods, inter-ethnic clashes are breaking out within and across states and fragile states are turning to militarization  to  control  the  situation.  t he  effects  of  desertification  are  increasingly  felt  globally  as  victims  turn  into  refugees,  internally   displaced  people  and  forced  migrants  or  they  turn  to  radicalization,  extremism  or  resource-driven  wars  for  survival.  if  we  are  to  restore peace, security and international stability in a context where changing weather events are threatening the livelihoods of  more and more people, survival options are declining and state capacities are overburdened, then more should be done to combat  desertification, reverse land degradation and mitigate the effects of drought. otherwise, many small-scale farmers and poor, land-dependent communities face two choices:  fight or flight.

 in 2008, food insecurity triggered riots in over 30 countries.  But  it  is  rural  communities  like  those  of  Bangalala,  who  depend  on   rainfed  agriculture  that  contribute  to  global  food  security.   t he  

 livelihoods  of  over  2  billion  people  worldwide  depend  on  500   million small-scale farmers.  Drylands, which make up nearly 34%  of the land mass and are a major source of food security especially  for  the  poor,  are  being  degraded  day-by-day.  How  shall  we  meet  the  growing  food  demand  and  increase  food  production  by  70%  by 2050, when productive land is declining and we do not act on  desertification and its related climate challenges?

 â¢	 52% of the land under agriculture is moderately or severely  degraded 

 â¢	 12 million hectares of productive land become barren every  year  due  to  desertification  and  drought  alone,  which  is  a   lost opportunity to produce 20 million tons of grain

 â¢	 agricultural yields could fall by up to 50% in some a frican 

 countries if production practices are not changed 

 â¢	 p oor people spend between 50% and 80% of their income  on food

 Land degradation is a problem that affects all regions, not  only  the  drylands  and  developing  countries.  a bout  one   third of all agricultural land is either highly or moderately  degraded.  Drylands  are  more  vulnerable  to  natural  and   human destruction due to the small water containment in  soil.

 t he increase in droughts and flash floods that are stronger, more  frequent  and  widespread  is  destroying  the  land  -  the  e arth’s   main  fresh  water  store.  Droughts  kill  more  people  than  any   other  single  weather-related  catastrophe  and  conflicts  among   communities  over  water  scarcity  are  gathering  pace.  f rom  the   Bangalala  midlands  to  Lake  turkana  and  Darfur,  from  Lake  chad   to the northern parts of Mali, niger, chad and the c entral african  republic, communities are migrating and being displaced as they  search  for  scarce  water  resources.  Without  restoring  degraded   land and securing it from further degradation, we cannot save the  land  from  the  impacts  of  climate  change,  replenish  underground  sources  to  meet  present  and  future  water  demands,  diffuse   ethnic tensions or reverse migration flows. 

 â¢	 over  1  billion  people  today  have  no  access  to  water,  and

 â¢	 by  2025,  up  to  2.4  billion  people  worldwide  may  be  living  in  

 areas subject to periods of intense water scarcity,  which may  displace as many as 700 million people by 2030  

 â¢	 collectively,  women  from  sub- saharan  a frica  spend  about  40

 t he  livelihoods  of  the  inhabitants  in   the  Lake  chad  region,  whose  economic   means  depend  mostly  on  agriculture   and  fishery,  are  under  threat  as  the  lake   shrinks.  t he  degradation  of  the  land   through  deforestation  and  inappropriate   land  management,  which  is  compounded   by  recurrent  severe  droughts,  has  led  to   declining  ground  water  supplies  to  the   lake.

 over-irrigation  and  the  construction  of  a   large-scale  network  of  canals  and  levees   are depleting the aral sea water resources  through  infiltration  and  evaporation,   degrading soils and vegetation, expanding  secondary  salinization,  and  reducing   agricultural efficiency in oases.

 as  the  climate  changes,  so  is  the  face  of  the  e arth,  and  with   devastating effects on the lives of those who depend on the land.  food-production zones are shifting, crops are failing, livestock are  dying  and  ponds,  lakes,  rivers  and  underground  water  sources  are  drying  up.  in  many  degraded  agricultural  areas,  as  climate  change  combines  with  pre-existing  challenges  it  is  compounding  the   situation and pushing people that depend on farming, pastoralism  and  other  natural  resources  into  forced  migrants.  Poor  rural   households that depend on rainfed agriculture are most vulnerable  to drought because they cannot absorb the losses.  Droughts have  led to migration, conflict or cessation in the past, in countries such  as  india,  Bangladesh,  Mauritania,  senegal,  Morocco  and  e ritrea.   Without  a  proper  adaptation  scenario,  the  prospect  of  conflict   and  environmentally  forced  migration  will  grow  as  the  soil’s  water  content falls and the land becomes less and less productive.

 â¢	 From  1900-2005,  precipitation  declined  in  the  sahel,  the   mediterranean region, southern a frica and parts of southern 

 asia 

 â¢	 The area affected by drought has increased since the 1970s,  with more intense and longer droughts observed over wider  areas since then, particularly in the tropics and sub-tropics 

 â¢	 From 1950-1980 10-14% of the land mass was classified as  dry, which rose to between 25-30% between 2000 and 2010

 â¢	 The  average  river  run-off  and  water  availability  is  projected   to decrease by 10-30% over some dry regions, including the  dry tropics 

 â¢	 climatic stresses account for 62.5% of all stresses on land  degradation in a frica  

 â¢	 seasonal  temperatures  in  the  sahel  have  risen  by  1.5-2.0   degrees c elsius, while the incidences of drought and erratic  rainfall have increased over the last 40 years 

 for  poor  people,  migration  is  a  complex  and  costly  venture.   often,  it  is  the  last  option  in  the  bid  to  survive,  but  many  poor   people have little choice but to flee their lands. Losing productive  land  is  driving  people  to  make  risky  life  choices.  in  rural  areas   where  people  depend  on  scarce  productive  land  resources,  land   degradation  is  a  driver  of  forced  migration.  With  livelihoods   coming  under  tremendous  pressure,  people  like  Maria  with  few   options  for  survival  can  feel  trapped.  Unless  we  change  the  way  we manage our land, in the next 30 years we may leave a billion or  more vulnerable poor people with little choice but to fight or flee.

 Many  of  the  intrastate  conflicts  taking  place  today  are  linked   to  the  control  and  allocation  of  natural  resources  by  states.  t he  exposure  of  more  and  more  poor  people  to  water  scarcity  and   hunger opens the door to the failure of fragile states and regional  conflicts. economic growth, development and poverty eradication  are  the  building  blocks  for  lasting  peace  and  national  security.   agriculture is a key driver of these processes for most developing  nations,  but  many  are  losing  crucial  agricultural  Gross  Domestic  Product ( aGDP) through land degradation. Without rights to land,  however,  people  like  Maria  have  little  incentive  to  manage  the   land and other natural resources sustainably. Granting users the  rights to own and use the resources they depend on can reverse  trends, pull the poor out of poverty and create the conditions to  build peace and a lasting security.

 countries with weak economic and political systems cannot meet or respond quickly enough to the various demands coming from thousands of communities  like those in Bangalala, which are dealing with multiple threats to their survival. a t the same time, forced migration, which is a diversification strategy for  such communities and, more often, a last resort for survival, is becoming ever more difficult due to the political instability it is creating in many countries.  t his  makes  vulnerable  communities  easy  prey  for  agents  of  radicalization,  political  extremism,  strife  and  conflict.  and  it  enables  the  masterminds  to  act simultaneously across many countries and thus, create political instability globally. t hese pressures may increase as the population rises. f ailing to  tackle desertification alongside climate change and poverty is a recipe for political and economic chaos.

 Desertification  is  tied  to  the  security  concerns  of  displacement,  refugees, forced migration, radicalization, extremism and violence.  t he  Us  national  security  strategy  refers  to  climate  change  as   a  key  global  challenge  that  will  lead  to  conflicts  over  refugees   and  resources,  suffering  from  drought  and  famine,  catastrophic   natural  disasters,  and  the  degradation  of  land  across  the  globe.   With  20  years  of  experience  in  hindsight,  investing  in  practical   solutions  that  transform  lives  and  reduce  the  vulnerability  of   communities  like  Maria’s  would  be  cheaper  and  work  better  than  investing in walls, wars and relief.

 sustainable land use practices: 

 over 250 sustainable land management (sLM) techniques that, at  once, combat land degradation and build its resilience to drought  and  climate  change  are  available  through  the  c onvention  alone.   Land  users  in  china,  for  instance,  have  access  to  over  1,000  sLM  practices.  sLM  methods  are  cheap,  but  durable.  With  the  right   incentives,  they  can  be  disseminated  widely  and  rapidly  to  land   users, including communities like those in Bangalala.

 experience

 in  niger,  where  some  sLM  practices  are  in  use,  it  costs  between  UsD 25 and UsD 65 to rehabilitate a hectare of degraded land. t he  humanitarian  assistance  of  UsD161  million   provided  to  niger  in  2011 could have secured between 3-7 million hectares of land, a  country whose total arable area is 15 million hectares.  

 in Harshin, ethiopia, the cost of providing 5 liters of water for five  months to the 80,000 people displaced by the 2011 drought was  estimated at UsD 3 million. r ehabilitating all non-operational local  water schemes was estimated at UsD 900,000 - less than a third  of the cost.  in some parts of the Batodi region of niger, access to  water  and  resilience  to  drought  improved  dramatically  by  using   sLM  practices.  Water  levels  in  depleted  underground  aquifers   rose by up to 14 meters. Women who once suffered like Maria are  now  fetching  water  in  wells  that  are  half  an  hour,  not  half  a  day,  away  from  their  homes.  t heir  households  are  less  vulnerable  to   drought and migrants have returned.

 t he  climatic  effects  on  land  occur  at  ecosystem  and  landscape   levels. t herefore, individual and community efforts to rehabilitate  the  land  are  at  their  most  effective  when  they  are  part  of  a   country-wide or regional-level effort to preserve and rehabilitate  landscapes.  Large-scale  interventions  provide  multiple  benefits   that go beyond national and regional levels. 

 experience

 t he  t hree  north  shelterbelt  is  china’s  initiative  to  rehabilitate   over 90 million hectares of desertified and degraded lands in its  northern  regions.  the  initiative  has  clear  targets  and  is  part  of   the  country’s  national  e conomic  and  social  Development  Plan.  in   addition to recovering productive land and restoring groundwater  sources  for  china,  this  afforestation  programme  is  sequestering  tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere and is expected, eventually,  to  eliminate  the  dust  storm  hazards  that  stretch  from  Beijing   through the Korean Peninsula and Japan to the United states.

 Drylands are prone to drought and desertification, but they are  vital  for  global  food  security  today  and  harbor  valuable  plant   and animal species that are essential for humanity’s adaptation  and  resilience  to  climate  change.  Drought  impacts  are  most   visible in human losses and on agricultural production, but have  higher  knock-on  effects  on  other  economic  sectors.  Droughts   do  not  have  to  kill,  lead  to  displacement  or  forced  migration,   even  in  drylands.  setting  up  national  and  regional  drought   policies  would  enable  countries  and  regions  to  preempt  their   impacts,  respond  to  crises  and  manage  droughts  effectively.   Voluntary  co-contributory  insurance  schemes  and  risk  transfer  mechanisms  designed  for  communities  in  drought-prone  areas   need to be part of these efforts. Drought relief may be rewarding  poor  resource  managers  and  punishing  proactive  planners  that  lack support mechanisms.

 experience

 in 2012, the state of c earÃ¡ in Brazil suffered its worst drought in  nearly five decades. Yet, communities that in the past succumbed  to  drought  effects  were  resilient.  t hey  did  not  damage  their   land  through  exposure  to  erosion  or  overuse.  f ollowing  early   warnings,  they  did  not  invest  money  in  cultivation  and  sold   their  livestock  before  the  drought  arrived.  When  drought   effects  began  to  bite,  households  received  monthly  payments   as  insurance  compensation  from  the  schemes  they  had   contributed to. Water was supplied from the state-constructed  and regulated reservoirs that are monitored in real-time. t hese  combined measures helped the state to respond effectively and  vulnerable populations to withstand one of the worst droughts.  a  recent  pilot  project  in  Malawi  shows  that  drought  insurance   schemes  for  vulnerable  populations  are  a  viable  and  feasible   mechanism for adaptation and resilience building.

 smart incentives are needed to change current practices in areas  vulnerable  to  desertification  and  drought  by:  discouraging  land   use practices that degrade the land; accelerating the adoption of  sustainable land use practices and drought planning; harmonizing  action  and  aligning  policies  across  ministries  and  agencies  with  land mandates; strengthening and simplifying the rights to land  and investments in natural resources; and strengthening drought  policies and climate adaptation and resilience mechanisms.

 experience

 in israel, a fund was created to compensate farmers for the output  they  would  lose  for  converting  to  sustainable  land  management  practices. By early 2013, four years after the fund’s creation, not  a  single  demand  for  compensation  had  been  submitted  by  those  who had adopted sLM practices.

 cutting  down  trees  for  charcoal  and  fuelwood  production  is   the  leading  driver  of  land  degradation  in  africa.  in  some  parts   of  Uganda,  however,  women  feel  no  obligation  to  plant  trees   because they cannot own any tree they plant; not even those they  plant  on  family  land.  in  niger,  once  the  government  guaranteed   tree  ownership  to  the  planters,  agroforestry  and  tree-planting   gathered  momentum  among  women,  the  landless,  and  even  on   communal land. 

 â¢	 giving  women  the  same  access  men  have  to  agricultural  

 resources  in  developing  countries  would  raise  farm

 Land  is  our  natural  capital.  But  healthy,  productive  land  is   diminishing  rapidly,  along  with  the  usual  coping  mechanisms   used  by  the  over  one  billion  people  like  Maria,  who  depend  on   degrading  land  and  live  in  poor  countries  or  fragile  states.  if  we  secure  productive  land,  we  will  strengthen  the  livelihoods  of   households, promote agriculture for national growth and economic  development,  protect  the  social  fabric  from  collapse  and  bolster  political  systems  in  fledgling  democracies.  e arly  intervention  is   far  cheaper  than  relying  on  relief  and  military  means  to  respond  to  political  crises  rooted  in  desertification  and  climate  change-induced drought.

 t he  international  community  is  defining  the  future  targets   for  poverty  eradication  and  sustainable  development.  Poverty   eradication  is  lagging  most  among  populations  affected  by   desertification, who also face increasing water and food scarcity.  t hese populations have to be at the center of our targets for the  sustainable  Development  Goals  and  the  post-2015  Development  agenda.  t o  improve  their  well-being  is  to  improve  our  own  well-being, our national security and to secure international stability  today and in future.
