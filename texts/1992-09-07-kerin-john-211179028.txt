 Australian NGOs to play major support role in Cambodian resettlement process

 The Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, John Kerin, today announced that $5 million would be made available for non government aid organisations (NG0s) to provide support to resettlement efforts in Cambodia.

 "A recent mission to Cambodia, involving AIDAB officials and NGO representatives, identifed the need for NGOs to provide special support to the resettlement organised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)," Mr Kerin said.

 Mr Kerin said that funds would be made available through Australia's overseas aid agency, AIDAB, over the next two financial years, for NGO schemes specifically targeted at helping returning refugees, internally displaced people, demobilised soldiers and locally affected communities."

 "Reintegration and rehabilitation would be the essential aims of the program," he said.

 NGO proposals for projects to utilise the special assistance program funds will be considered in priority areas including:

 â¢ Primary health care â¢ Water sanitation â¢ Supplementary food â¢ Agricultural recovery

 â¢ Job creation and income generation â¢ Education â¢ Shelter â¢ Post trauma assistance.

 The funds form part of the $49 million, four-year bilateral aid program for Cambodia announced in April.
