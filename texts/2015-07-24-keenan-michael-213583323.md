 TRANSCRIPT    

 Friday 24 July 2015    

 Speech to Lowy Institute - Counter Terrorism    

 Check against delivery   

 Great to be here at Lowy Institute. 

 How this Institute came to exist is a good starting point for my address today. 

 Created out the generosity of a former refugee who came to Australia and then  proceeded to take advantage of all the opportunities our country offers. 

 Then he took this business internationally to again display to the world Australian  know how and our can do attitude. 

 I am sorry that Frank Lowy couldn’t be with us today, but I am grateful for this  opportunity and I understand that he is recovering well.  

 Stories like Frank Lowy’s are a great reminder to me of the achievement of  modern Australia - a place where people can arrive, be accepted regardless of  their background, and go on and make a life that places them amongst the  luckiest people in the world. 

 That opportunity remains open to each and every Australian.  

 Australians are a welcoming people who have a long history of embracing new  arrivals to our nation.  

 We manage our diversity in a way that should be the model for the rest of the  world and we have avoided some of the mistakes that I think are evident  elsewhere. 

 We have done this in the face of many challenges and we should reaffirm our  commitment to it, undeterred by the new security threat we are confronting. 

 It is the strength of our culture that will be our most effective weapon to protect  the Australian people from the threat of terror. 

 This threat has grown in an unpredictable and chilling fashion over the last year  and has already resulted in two terror attacks on Australian soil. 

 Our authorities have disrupted a further six terror attacks. 

 We expect this threat is going to be with us for years. 

 The breakdown of the Syrian state has allowed the most violent and barbaric  terror movement to establish a footprint over large parts of Syria and Western  Iraq. 

 It now claims to control an area larger than Lebanon where they oppress through  fear and violence. 

 This base has created the wealthiest terror organisation to have ever existed - it is  now estimated to hold more than a billion dollars in assets. 

 ISIL’s unprecedented expansion is acting as a magnet for extremists, including  many from the West.   

 Our agencies are seeing an increase in individuals providing support to terrorist  groups both domestically and abroad. 

 Around 120 Australians are currently fighting in Syria and Iraq. 

 Up to 35 Australians are believed to have been killed. 

 There are approximately 160 people in Australia actively supporting extremist  groups through financing and recruitment. 

  ASIO is currently investigating 400 high-priority cases - a number that’s almost  double from a year ago. 

 ISIL has effectively outsourced terrorism by urging its supporters overseas to carry  out attacks - attacks which, as the Prime Minister has stated, require little more  than a camera-phone, a knife and a victim. 

 It emphasises that there is no need to consult with anybody, including ISIL itself,  before launching such attacks.  

 Such a prescription makes attacks unpredictable and therefore harder for our  security agencies to counter.  

 Terrorist attack planning is becoming more frequent, warning times are shrinking  and the perpetrators are becoming younger. 

 Police have concerns for teenagers as young as fourteen but sadly these might  not be the youngest people that ISIL radicalise and incite to violence.  

 It is no exaggeration to state that Australians are facing the most significant  ongoing threat from terrorism in our nation’s history. 

 This government is not, and has never been, ignorant of this threat.  

 Since coming to government, we have been on the front foot in responding to the  national threat environment. 

 We have invested an additional $1.3 billion to support our counter-terrorism  efforts. 

 We have also passed four tranches of legislation to strengthen the ability of  intelligence and law enforcement agencies to investigate, monitor, arrest and  prosecute home-grown extremists and returning foreign fighters. 

 We have: 

 ï· improved and modernised the legislation governing Australia’s intelligence  agencies; 

 

 ï· Stopped extremists training and fighting in overseas conflicts, where they  could gain the will and capacity to conduct attacks upon return;   

 ï· Made it an offence - punishable by up to 10 years in prison - for any  Australian to enter a declared area without a legitimate purpose;   

 ï· Lowered the arrest threshold, and strengthened our control order regime  for our law enforcement agencies - which has proven instrumental in  disrupting and preventing terrorist attacks against Australians; and   

 ï· Passed data retention legislation vital to the investigation of security  threats.  The Government also introduced legislation to strip Australian citizenship from  dual nationals who engage in terrorism.  

 We want to ensure terrorists who are dual nationals are prevented from  returning to Australia and dual nationals who engage in terrorism within Australia  can be removed, where possible.  

 The threat is constantly evolving so our response needs to be flexible and  adaptable. 

 We continue to take into account lessons learnt from recent counter-terrorism  operations. 

 Since last September, 23 people have been charged as a result of eight  counter-terrorism operations around Australia.   

 But when disrupting an attack, evidence to secure a conviction is not always  guaranteed. 

 Our police do not have the luxury to watch and wait, saving lives is the priority -  always. 

 This should not be controversial - but critics are quick to judge. 

 Some people have attacked the police for targeting the Islamic community. 

 As I have said many times we are not the enemies of Islam, nor are we the  enemies of any other religion. This is not about targeting Muslims. 

 As Australians, our strength comes from diversity; it comes from inclusion; it  comes from our culture. 

 We should all be smart enough not to confuse the acts of a violent extremist  minority with the beliefs of hundreds of thousands of law abiding Australian  Muslims. 

 However our law enforcement has a job to do; they must protect our community  and they will apply our laws equally and without discrimination in order to do so.  

 We will not, and have not, hesitated. We have cancelled the passports of  individuals who want to join terrorist groups overseas.  

 To date, more than 120 passports have been cancelled and 16 refused. 

 12 passports have been suspended by the Foreign Minister under new powers  granted to her in our foreign fighters legislation last year. 

 Our border protection agencies continue to do important work in stemming the  movements of departing and returning foreign fighters. 

 The Australian Border Force’s Counter-Terrorism Units, which are placed at  Australia’s major international airports, have successfully intercepted a number of  individuals. 

 Overseas, we are committed to attacking ISIL at its source. 

 Australian forces have joined an international coalition designed to blunt ISIL’s  advance and build the capacity of the Iraqi state. 

 ISIL’s deep roots in Syria represent a long term threat to the region’s stability.  

 Stopping ISIL’s contagion is therefore a key priority; it has already taken  advantage of insecurity in Lebanon, Yemen, Libya, Egypt, Kuwait and Tunisia to  conduct attacks and bolster its ranks.  

 We must ensure that we remain ahead of the terrorists at all times.   

 Criminals are adept at exploiting emerging opportunities and perceived gaps in  law enforcement information and capability. 

 Because of this our law enforcement and intelligence agencies are increasingly  dependent on timely and accurate information to keep Australians safe.  

 By making our information sharing stronger, we will be able to disrupt these  terrorist threats more quickly.  

 It is just one example of why it is vitally important that the Commonwealth  continues to engage with the states and territories who play such a critical part in  community engagement and in countering terrorism. 

 In today’s environment it is more important than ever to ensure that our security  and non-security efforts to combat home-grown terrorism are well coordinated  and effective. 

 This is one of the key functions that the Prime Minister has tasked me with as part  of my new role. Together, with Greg Moriarty, Australia’s counter-terrorism  coordinator, we will continue to work with the states and territories to make sure  we have the strategies in place to stay one step ahead.  

 Yesterday, COAG released Australia’s Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which sets out  our coordinated national approach to counter-terrorism. 

 The Strategy explains the threat and how our governments are working together  and in partnership with communities and the private sector to counter it.             

 The Strategy addresses the entire violent extremist spectrum, from radicalisation  to carrying out an attack. 

 It focusses on five core elements, with prevention as the first line of defence:  

 ï· challenging violent extremist ideologies;   ï· stopping people from becoming terrorists;   ï· shaping the global environment;   ï· disrupting terrorist activity within Australia; and   ï· having robust response and recovery arrangements should an attack occur. 

 

 Importantly, the Strategy embodies the spirit of working together with the States  and Territories. 

 As first responders to a terrorist incident, States and Territories are on the front  lines of our counter-terrorism efforts. 

 When the events in Martin Place unfolded last year, it was New South Wales  police that led the response. 

 After an attack, they supply shelter, reconstruct damaged areas and provide  healthcare services. 

 They are also responsible for the imprisonment and ongoing custody of convicted  terrorists. 

 Therefore, a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy has to be a national one. 

 We have seen joint Commonwealth-State counter-terrorism teams rolled out in  each jurisdiction and the formation of the AFP’s National Disruption Group. 

 Yesterday, COAG also agreed to introduce a new National Terrorism Threat  Advisory System. 

 The changes give greater flexibility and precision to the definition of the threat  levels.   

 Panic and uncertainty are central to acts of terrorism. 

 Our new threat levels will provide more information on what the threat means,  where the threat is coming from, potential targets and the means of attack.   

 Despite our efforts, Australians continue to be groomed by these terrorists who  would prey upon the vulnerable and the young to recruit them to their vile cause. 

 Young women are still volunteering to be terrorist brides, only to arrive and to be  sold off to murderers.  

 Young men and women brainwashed to the point where they will blow  themselves up - and innocent others. 

 Every country in the world is grappling with this question - what makes people  susceptible to both extremist influences and recruitment by terrorists? 

 There is no one answer to this problem, no silver bullet. 

 Across the world, multi-faceted approaches are being trialled to stop individuals  heading down the dark path of radicalisation. 

 What we do know is that countering violent extremism will not work in isolation  from broader social cohesion policies.  

 This is why the Australian Government has committed $660 million for initiatives  in the Social Services’ portfolio. 

 We are investing in social harmony, settlement and cohesion in our communities. 

 No one group in Australia sits outside and apart from the opportunities that our  country has so effectively offered to waves of new migrants. 

 If we can prevent vulnerable people from feeling further alienated by ensuring  they have a sense of belonging, or are part of a strong and supportive community,  then we can stop some from becoming susceptible to violent extremism in the  first place. 

 Engaging our youth is imperative in helping us to reject hatred and intolerance.  

 We provide nearly $2 million every year to national initiatives, such as student  workshops, education materials and employment assistance. 

 We have committed a further $200,000 to the AFL’s Bachar Houli Academy, a  leadership programme for junior footballers of Muslim background.  

 In March, a $500,000 grant was awarded to the Islamic Museum for a new  education programme to promote understanding amongst children and the  general public of Islamic culture and its contribution to society throughout  history. 

 But it is also critical to recognise when at-risk individuals may need help from  specialised intervention programmes.  

 We have provided funding of nearly $12 million under our Living Safe Together  program to directly engage with those showing signs of radicalised thinking, and  identify what response is required through unique case management support. 

 Some of these services may be accessible through mainstream government  programmes, but many are best delivered by communities themselves.  

 For this reason we have provided community funding of nearly $2 million to over  40 organisations to significantly boost the ability of such groups to work with  vulnerable individuals.  

 What we know is that a community group can be better placed than government  to provide the support these individuals need.  

 However there are also organisations where, due to the very nature of the  intervention work they are doing, talking about them publicly will undermine  what is being achieved.  

 Despite our considerable social and economic investments, ISIL will continue to  draw in people with its propaganda. 

 Research has found that ISIL supporters have three times more global friends on  Instagram compared to the average Australian user.  

 On Twitter, the Brookings Institute found that ISIL and its supporters had at least  46,000 active accounts, each with an average of 1,000 followers. 

 This indicates they have developed a deep and pervasive network of supporters  who can spread their messages instantaneously and to all corners of the globe. 

 These produce an array of magazines, videos and graphics, which is then shared  and distributed further by online followers.  

 This is where the threat is born, and the Government has invested almost $22  million to tackle it.  

 We are already working with social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook  and Google as well as organisations like the Australian Communications Media  Authority to take down violent extremist material.  

 Google has also provided start-up funding for an app to connect mentors and  mentees.  

 Because those feeling disempowered and isolated are at greater risk of  radicalisation. 

 The recent HackAbout held during the CVE Summit in Sydney provided a platform  for developing efforts that chip away at drivers of radicalisation, whether it be  isolation, the promise of adventure that ISIL offers or the need for community  mentors. 

 This year, we also launched the Report Online Extremism tool to improve the  ability of Australians to report violent extremist material that’s found on the  internet. 

 Reports are already being referred to law enforcement and security agencies and,  where appropriate, to social media providers to take down where the content is  unacceptable. 

 Our focus is not solely on tearing down content. 

 The reality is no one idea will prevent radicalisation.  

 To better understand why it is that people are being lured in by these terrorists  our operatives will monitor and analyse the lies being generated.  

 With this knowledge we will be able to fight their messaging through a range of  overt and covert means.  

 We will give voice to those in our community who can reach our target audiences  with messaging that challenges the terrorists’ false claims. 

 We must teach our children that they cannot believe everything they read on the  internet; to teach them to be able to identify the lies for what they are.    

 To help with this task we have appointed a new Children’s e-safety commissioner  to coordinate Australia’s approach to protecting our children against not just the  paedophiles but also the terrorists who would take advantage of their innocence. 

 We have also initiated a new project with the Australian Multicultural Foundation  to help parents identify and manage the risks of online radicalisation. 

 Just as parents and families have gained greater understanding of the dangers  posed by online sexual predators, there needs to be increased awareness of the  threat from online terrorist groomers. 

 Well-informed and well-equipped families, strong communities and cohesive  institutions such as schools and workplaces the frontline of our defence against  terrorism at home. 

 But the threat of terrorism is not one that is limited to Australia alone; it is one  that knows no boundaries. 

 While we are doing great work at home, in order to challenge the pervasive and  global threat of terrorism, collective international action is required. 

 To begin with, we must look to address the threat of terrorism in our region. 

 We are concerned that in South East Asia, where governments have made so  much progress over the last decade in attacking terrorist networks, that ISIL is  serving to inspire and re-energise existing extremists groups. 

 ISIL’s toxic message has infiltrated groups in Indonesia, Malaysia and the southern  Philippines. 

 Already we are seeing signs in social media that the recent attack in Tunisia is  motivating extremists in our own region to contemplate similar attacks. 

 In March this year, Indonesia’s Vice-President Jusuf Kalla said the spread of ISIL’s  ideology and its recruitment of Indonesians was a direct threat to Indonesia’s  national security. 

 This statement occurred just after Indonesia’s national police anti-terrorism unit  arrested five men in raids in Jakarta. 

 Similarly, Malaysia as Chair of this year’s ASEAN Summit recognised “the growing  threat of radicalisation and violent extremism, and the real and present danger it  poses to our region”. 

 Such expressions of concern demonstrate the need for countries in the region to  stand together to develop shared strategies for combating terrorists acts and  propaganda. 

 Our collective efforts to combat terrorism is a critical priority. 

 I will be seeking to further advance our counter-terrorism cooperation when I visit  Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia next month, building on my trip to the region  last year.  

 Australia is seeking to enhance information sharing, promote legislative reform,  improve international crime cooperation and border management and develop  tools to combat radicalisation via social media.  

 At the other end of the so-called foreign fighter pipeline we are strengthening our  cooperation with the countries of the Middle East.   

 As part of the Government’s response to foreign fighters, we have expanded the  AFP’s footprint in the region, with new AFP positions in both Ankara and Amman. 

 These officers already share real-time intelligence and evidence in support of  domestic and international disruption activities. 

 They form part of the AFP’s international network across 29 countries and the 16  bilateral counter-terrorism cooperation agreements we have worldwide. 

 We are also leading regional efforts to tackle the issue of terrorism and  radicalisation. 

 In June, Australia hosted the Regional Summit to Counter Violent Extremism.  

 During the Summit, regional leaders and Australian community partners had an  opportunity to exchange ideas and discuss lessons learned in countering violent  extremism.  

 We also agreed to strengthen our engagement with the private sector, identify  best ways to neutralise terrorist propaganda, and further invest in the  communities and community organisations that are the first line of defence when  countering violent extremism. 

 These outcomes will form part of our region’s contribution to a United Nations  General Assembly leaders’ meeting on countering violent extremism. 

 Australia is not the type of country to sit back and watch things happen. 

 We have been on the front foot when it comes to global action on terrorism. 

 The threat of terrorism has not been underestimated by your Government. 

 Our determined responses are already far-reaching - and to date, successful. 

 From social cohesion policies, to intervention programmes, to disrupting terrorist  attacks, to negotiating international agreements, we are addressing the full  spectrum of terrorism threats. 

 The threat of terrorism is dynamic, but so is this Government’s resolve to keep  Australia safe.
