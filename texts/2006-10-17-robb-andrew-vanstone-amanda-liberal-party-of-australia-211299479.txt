  REFUGEE SElTLEMENT SERVICES DISCUSSION PAPER RELEASED 

  A discussion paper that promotes successful settlement for refugee and humanitarian  entrants through further programs to assist with the learning of English, getting a job  and understanding life in Australia was released today for public comment. 

  In a joint statement the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator  Amanda Vanstone, and the Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Andrew Robb, said the paper  also aimed to ensure people had realistic expectations and an understanding of life in  Australia before they arrived. 

  “The paper is about giving people the skills and incentive they need to participate  quickly and effectively in mainstream activities, and generally build a successful life in  A u s t r a I i a, ” they said . 

  “It also recognises that the Federal, state and territory governments need to work  together to meet the needs of newly arrived humanitarian entrants.” 

  Senator Vanstone said each year some 13,000 refugee and humanitarian entrants  settie in Ausiraiia* 

  “World events have a huge impact on our refugee programme and the shifting nature of  world trouble spots means people will be coming from places that have not been  t r ad it ion a I h u man it a r i an sou rce cou n t r i es for A u st ra I i a, ” Se n at o r Van sto n e said . 

  “Consequently with the shift in the programme towards the Horn of Africa and Middle  Eastern countries we have found people face different and more difficult settlement  barriers than previous arrivals.” 

  Mr Robb said that on a per capita basis, Australia settles more off-shore refugees than  any other country, including the US and Canada and spends more on the settlement  needs of each new migrant than either of those two countries.
