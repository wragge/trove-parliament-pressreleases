 Media Release  SENATOR THE HON. CHRISTOPHER ELLISON 

 

 Minister for Justice and Customs  Senator for Western Australia 

 E48/04  22 April 2004 

 

 National CCTV centre enhances border protection   

 A world-first national closed circuit television (CCTV) network is immensely important in securing  Australia’s borders, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Chris Ellison said today.   

 “Australia has a vast coastline with many ports and protecting our borders is a huge task,” Senator  Ellison said during an inspection of the Customs National Monitoring Centre in Melbourne.   

 “It is very important that the Australian public is aware of what is being done at a national level to  protect Australia’s borders.   

 “This is the first time that we have made public the work of the National Monitoring Centre since the  nationwide CCTV network became fully operational late last year.   

 “The latest technology plays a vital role in helping hard-working Customs officers to keep Australia’s  borders safe and secure from illicit drugs, disease, illegal arrivals and other threats to the nation’s  welfare.”   

 The Customs national waterfront CCTV network consists of more than 220 cameras at 88 wharf areas.     

 All the cameras are linked to local Customs Houses, Regional Monitoring Centres in each state, and the  National Monitoring Centre in Melbourne.   

 Senator Ellison said that the national waterfront CCTV system allows Customs to monitor border  activity at Australia’s major ports, 24-hours a day, 365-days of the year.   

 “I am advised that the technology used in the Customs CCTV network as well as its capabilities as a  border protection tool is as comprehensive as anything anywhere else in the world.  I understand that  there has been some overseas interest in our network.   

 “This surveillance network provides an effective and efficient monitoring of Australia’s waterfront  without the need to maintain a physical presence around the clock.”    

 Automated video motion detection ensures that activity on the waterfront, no matter what time of the  day or night, can be targeted and monitored.   

 “Monitoring Australia’s waterfront using the CCTV network is just one of the technologies  implemented by Customs to protect our borders and community,” Senator Ellison said.
