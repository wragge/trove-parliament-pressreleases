     EAST  TIMORESE  SHOULD  STAY  

 

 The announcement that 50 East Timorese refugees have not been granted Permanent  Residence in Australia has prompted the following comments by the Shadow Minister for  Immigration, Laurie Ferguson:   

 “The history of the large numbers of Timorese who arrived in the mid nineties was  dominated by the Government’s decision that processing on their cases would be  interrupted. Clearly the reason was to avoid embarrassment to the Indonesian  Government over Human Rights abuses in occupied East Timor.”   

 “I do not enter the debate about the strength of the individuals’ claims at that stage.   However, clearly justice was not done.”   

 “The remaining rejected small minority have been here for many years. They have  become a part of Australia’s society due to the Government’s delays. Whilst it would be  hard to argue that they would face persecution in contemporary East Timor, humanity  demands that due to the handling of this case, they be allowed to stay,” Laurie Ferguson  concluded.    

 For further information, please contact Laurie Ferguson on 02 9637 4714 or Aisha  Amjad on 0413 511 666.
