 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 14 March 2014   

 Recipe for disaster; Manus Island situation  worsening   

 Tensions are rising inside the Manus Island detention camp and the Australian Government  must take seriously the prospect of another attack on the centre, the Australian Greens have  said.   

 “Recordings from within the camp make it clear, employees who took part in the attacks are  back in the centre and tensions are rising again,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson,  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The refugees fear that another attack is imminent and it’s clear that the Abbott Government is  unable to guarantee their safety. This is a recipe for disaster and the Government must take  action.   

 “Those employees who are suspected of carrying out the attacks need to be removed from the  centre immediately and the refugees there need to be brought back to Australia where they can  be kept safe.   

 “Rather than worrying about taking Mr Abbott’s job, Scott Morrison should be focussed on fixing  his Manus Island failure.”
