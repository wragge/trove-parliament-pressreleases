 RESEARCH GRANT FOR BLOOD PRESSURE

 CONTROL STUDY IN CANBERRA

 The Australian Minister for Health, Dr Neal Blewett,.  .

 announced today a Health Services Research and Development 

 Grant of $91 347 to Dr Trevor Beard of Woden Valley Hospital 

 for Stage II of the Canberra blood pressure trial.

 Dr Beard would lead a team for a year as part of a 

 continuing study of the effects of the blood pressure on a 

 large voluntary sample of an urban population who were willing 

 to modify their diet, particularly by the reduction of the 

 sodium content of their food.

 High blood pressure was the main risk factor for 

 coronary heart disease and stroke - two of the most common .  

 causes of premature death - and the study aimed to collect 

 conclusive evidence that altering the balance of sodium and 

 potassium intake would lower the blood pressure of partici­

 pants in the study.

 .  Dr Blewett said the researchers had suggested that prevent­

 ing new cases of blood pressure would probably have more effect 

 on the quality of life of the population and the cost of 

 medical care than any single advance in community health. He 

 hoped that the study would confirm this proposition.

 Dr John Deeble was awarded a $39 566 grant to cover .  

 the cost of employing a researcher to examine and analyse 

 systems for allocating resources to health services in Austra­

 lia both on a national scale and State by State. .

 Dr Blewett said the study would enable comparisons to 

 be made and conclusions to be drawn between States which have 

 developed formulas for. allocating funds to health services 

 and those which have not.

 The awards were among grants totalling $408 952 which 

 had been awarded to researchers in three States and the Austra­

 lian Capital Territory.
