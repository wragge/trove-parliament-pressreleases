  KOSOVO REFUGEES TO PLAY SOCCER

  

  Federal Minister for Sport and Tourism, Jackie Kelly, has intervened 
to ensure that Kosovo refugees can play competitive soccer duri ng 
their stay in Australia.

  

 Minister Kelly met with Soccer Tasmania last night 
and agreed to assist the players in their wish to continue to play their 
cherished game.

  

 Jackie Kelly said that following the meetings it had 
been agreed that the Kosovo refugees would play together as a celebrity 
team against other senior teams in Tasmania. The initiative stems from 
a wish expressed at a meeting of the refugees that they play together, 
as one group, week in week out for the duration of their stay.

  

 Minister Kelly said that given the limited duration 
of their visit the most important outcome is that the refugees are out 
on the field playing not caught up in red tape.

  

 Soccer Tasmania has welcomed the outcome declaring 
that the games represent a unique opportunity for Tasmania to meet some 
fresh competition from far afield.

  

 In the following fortnight, games will include competition 
with the Glenorchy Knights and the Hobart Zebras two of the leading 
clubs in the Tasmanian senior competition.

  

 The other clubs are also queuing up to play against 
the celebrity safe-haven team.

  

 Jackie Kelly said that she had spoken with Soccer 
Australia and was confident that should the refugees be in Australia 
long enough, there was a very real likelihood that they would be approved 
by the sport to play in national competitions.

  

 “The way is open for Fifa and Soccer Australia to 
grant the refugees a permit should one be required. There is no reason 
for that not to happen.

  

 “It is important that Soccer Australia work within 
the rules of their international government body. However, Australia 
will use all its influence to encourage a positive outcome for the refugees.

  

 “I am pleased that as a first step we have been 
able to get the safe-haven players out there on the field helping to 
put their troubles behind them,” Jackie Kelly said.

  

 The Minister said that the Australian Institute of 
Sport is also promoting a sports ambassadors program through UNHCR for 
elite athletes to visit refugees camps.
