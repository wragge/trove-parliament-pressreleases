 SHAYNE NEUMANN 

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR    

 PETER DUTTON SHOULD SUPPORT ASIO DIRECTOR-GENERAL    

 Immigration Minister Peter Dutton needs to stand up today and offer his support to  ASIO Director-General Duncan Lewis who has denied a causal link between  refugees and terrorism in Australia.    

 Unfair criticism has been levelled at ASIO’s DG Mr Lewis by commentators and even  former Prime Minister Tony Abbott after Mr Lewis denied an alleged connection  between refugees and terrorism from Senator Pauline Hanson in Senate Estimates.    

 Immigration Minister Peter Dutton should support facts and support genuine  refugees who have resettled in Australia after his Department undertook strict  character and security checks.    

 The Attorney General and multiple counter-terrorism experts have supported Mr  Lewis, a former Army Special Operations Commander.    

 It’s unacceptable that Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has remained silent while  allowing others such as Senator Malcolm Roberts to spread untruths about a  connection between refugees and terrorism.    

 Peter Dutton should stand up and reconfirm his trust in ASIO and defend refugees,  as well as the security checks and screening measures of the Department of  Immigration and Border Protection.    

 Labor stands in support of our security agencies and their ongoing commitment to  protecting the security of all Australians.
