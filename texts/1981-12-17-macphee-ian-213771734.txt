 COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY INTO THE RECOGNITION OF OVERSEAS QUALIFICATIONS

 Members of the Committee of Enquiry into the Recognition  of Overseas Qualifications who were recently appointed by  the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Hon  Ian Macphee, met this week in Melbourne to discuss plans 

 for a wide ranging examination of the problems associated  with the recognition of overseas qualifications and training.

 The Committee is chaired by Mr Ron Fry, MBE former  National Director and Chief Executive of the Metal Trades  Industry Association.

 The Government's decision to appoint the Committee follows  recent recommendations by the Conference of Commonwealth  and State Ministers for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  and the Australian Council on Population and Ethnic  Affairs. -

 Mr Macphee noted that there had been concern by Common­ wealth and State Governments about the problems faced  by migrants in Australia who have qualifications which  are not recognised by the relevant State or Professional  Body in Australia and who therefore are unable to work 

 at jobs for which they originally trained.

 While there is a need to maintain high standards in  Australia it is equally important to ensure that this  country obtains maximum benefit from the talents and  training of its residents.

 "We have already squandered too many of the talents of  those whom we have been pleased to accept into our  community", Mr Macphee said.

 One important task of the Committee will be to seek  submissions from key individuals and organisations  concerned with the recognition of overseas qualifications.   These will include ethnic community organisations. The  views of other interested parties and the general community  will also be sought.

 Committee of Enquiry into the Recognition of Overseas

 Qualifications - Terms of Reference

 The Committee of Enquiry shall:

 1. Identify the nature and scope of the problems of non­ recognition of overseas qualifications and training with  particular reference to:

 (a) the problems experienced by people trained  overseas which are not encountered by those  trained in Australia; and

 (b) the relevance to decisions to admit to practice/  licensure/registration of fluency in English,  residence requirements, cultural and other factors.

 2. Consider the procedures for recognition of overseas qual­ ifications and training, with a view to identifying:

 (a) whether existing legislation and procedures for the  assessment and recognition of overseas qualifications  are adequate and equitable;

 (b) problems which arise out of the relationship between  migrant selection procedures and the recognition of  qualifications; and

 (c) special problems experienced by refugees which are of  a different quality from those experienced by migrants  in general.

 3. Consult widely and seek submissions from the general  community and relevant bodies; such bodies to include  Federal and State Governments and Authorities, licensing  and. registration boards, trade unions and professional 

 associations, employer organisations education and training  institutions, ethnic communities and other bodies operating  in the field of ethnic affairs.

 4. Report conclusions and make recommendations to the Minister  for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs upon the actions which  should be taken to overcome the problems identified.
