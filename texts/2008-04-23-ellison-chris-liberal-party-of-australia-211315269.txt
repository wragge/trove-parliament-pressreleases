 MEDIA RELEASE 

 

 “Memo to Mr Rudd - these are the real facts on Australia’s refugee and humanitarian  programme”   

 “Prime Minister Rudd demonstrated in his Monday night interview on the 7:30 Report that he is  unaware of the real facts about Australia’s refugee and humanitarian policy,” said Shadow  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Ellison.   

 When Asked:  ‘Does it stir you? When you have to stand as you do all the time listening to  Advance Australia Fair and the words of Advance Australia Fair, does it stir  you?’   

 The Prime Minister responded:    ‘It does, and the reason it does is when you've got verses like "For those who  come across the seas we've boundless plains to share" that that should be the  resolve of any Australian Government, unlike the one we replaced which seemed  to pull up the shutters when it came to our proper international obligations,  particularly to refugees who found themselves in real strife’.    

 “Australia is a signatory to the refugee convention and is one of less than a dozen countries with  an ongoing refugee and humanitarian programme.   

 “Mr Rudd should know that Australia has a longstanding bi-partisan policy for our significant  refugee and humanitarian programme.    

 “The successful border security policies of the Coalition Government enabled us be a world  leader in refugee resettlement and assist those in the greatest need of our help.   

 “Australia has the second largest intake in the world with an annual programme of around  13,000 and a world leading settlement programme that delivers the assistance needed to  successfully settle and participate fully in our community.   

 “Mr Rudd has labelled the public service as ‘politicised’. If he takes the time to meet with the  officials who work in the Department of Immigration and Citizenship he will learn that they have  advised successive governments and they are dedicated to the ongoing delivery of a outstanding  refugee and humanitarian programme,’ said Senator Chris Ellison.   

 Australia’s settlement services include cultural orientation assistance, links to essential services  such as Centrelink, Medicare and banking, accommodation support, help in establishing a  household, health, psychological services and information. English language tuition is also  provided under the Adult Migrant English Program and employment services provided through  the Job Network.
