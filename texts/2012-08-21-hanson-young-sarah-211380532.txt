 MEDIA RELEASE 

  21 August 2012 

 Hollow promises as Government and Abbott Coalition unite to vote down increasing humanitarian  intake 

 The Government’s unfulfilled promises to increase Australia’s humanitarian intake and give refugees  safety in our region were on stark display today as those recommendations were voted down by the  major parties in the Senate, said the Australian Greens. 

 “Despite the rush of getting the ‘Gillard Pacific Solution” legislation through Parliament last week,  the government is dragging its feet to the point of standstill when it comes to other critical  humanitarian measures identified by the Houston Panel” said Greens immigration spokesperson  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young today. 

 “My motion called on the Government to immediately implement key Houston Panel  recommendations to raise the humanitarian quota to 20,000 and advise Parliament the timeframes  on the rest, but it was voted down by both old parties. 

 “It’s becoming increasingly clear that the Government’s full support for the Houston Panel’s  recommendations was nothing but hollow words. 

 "Mr Paris Aristotle reiterated today that unless the swift action is taken to increase humanitarian  intake to 20,000 and funding is increased to assist asylum seekers in our region, offshore processing  will fail even the aspirations of the Houston Panel - yet the government seems to be ignoring his  advice. 

 “It is evident that the Government has no intention of implementing the Houston Panel’s  recommendations that relate directly to saving refugees’ lives, but rather are intent on punishing  vulnerable people by shipping them off indefinitely to the island prisons of Nauru and Manus Island.
