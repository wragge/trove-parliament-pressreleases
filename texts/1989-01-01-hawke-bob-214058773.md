 PRC nationals remain in limbo

 /Q 9 A ./d ^ o /

 C c A )

 Prime Minister Bob Hawke has recently made remarks on several occasions  as to the Government's intention about the long-term future of the PRC  nationals who were already in Australia on 20 June 1989. We are now more  confused than ever about our future.

 From the transcript of the news conference yesterday prepared by the Prime  Minister's Office, we are now told that the Government is planning to  allow PRC nationals another limited period of stay, possibly a few years, and  moreover, the Immigration Department will not start processing our 

 applications for permanent residence until the end of that period. If so, it  will be no difficult to the special temporary entry permits we received  months ago. It does not solve any of fundemantal problems we face today.

 We have been in 'residence limbo-land' for too long with such special  temporary entry permits . Many of us have been unable to travel overseas  to do academic work; those who have finished their courses, have been  unable to obtain permanent employment related to our quanlifications. This  makes it almost impossible for us to earn even a basic livelihood. All of us  have lost our right to Medicare, the basic social benefit vital to us all. We  could not take up formal studies, many of us are being ripped off by  unscrupucous employers and agents if. we have worked in the past 12  months. Should those of us in their late 30s give up hope of having a career  in the future? How about those (300) who have their children here already  and have lost the right for their schooling? Our spouses can not enrol in  courses to improve their English. How can we make long -term plans when 

 the Australian Government appears to change its mind every week?

 All in all, our lives have yet again been put on hold, and years and years of  waiting will ruin lives of ourselves and even our children. The past 12  months of suffering is more than enough for m a « f of us; any further delay  or postponement of residence decisions is more than enough for anyone. 

 Why should we suffer for more years.

 Last February, the Australian Government created a special temporary entry  permit allowing PRC nationals legally here on 20 June 1989 to change their  visas (into class 829 TEPs) and thus to obtain the right (under s.47(A) ) to  seek permanent residence on all s.6A(l) grounds of the Migration Act.

 However, although some 8,100 PRC nationals had applied for residence as at  31 March this year, the Immigration Department stated that only 5  applications for residence (all PRC diplomats and officials) had been  processed since the Beijing Massacre. Subsequently, we learn from SBS TV's 

 Asia Report (on 1 June) that 2 of our student colleagues in Canberra had  received permanent residence on humanitarian grounds on 14 April and 28  May respectively. We believe the rest of PRC nationals who have made  their judgements about the political situation in China and their own 

 activities in anti-Chinese Government protests, found themselves have real  fears of persecution, and lodged their applications for refuge should also  have the same treatment.

 We reiterate that most of us did not come to Australia with the intention  of staying permanently. It is the tragic Beijing Massacre and subsequent  official purges and persecution, events which are beyond our control, which  make it undeniably impossible for us to return or be returned to China  safely in the foreseeable future. The fundamental decision we seek is a  residence status that allows us to get on again with our lives in the 

 unrestricted way (work, study, and travel).

 We do not seek, nor do we propose, to gamble today with our lives on some  chance that some day in the future, within the Australian Government's  next deadline, it may be safe enough for the next Australian Government to  decide to send us back. Our lives and m re  remain priceless and not a matter  of administrative expedience.

 We, the Chinese, even whthin our own lifetimes, know enough of Chinese  .politics and history not to place good money on such long odds' as a promise  of what might be 'good form' in Beiging in the future. We see Australia as a  dear friend who recognises our real plight and will give us the hope of a 

 stable, not temporary humanitarian refuge.

 Therefore, we appeal to the Australian Government to:

 .

 1. start processing PRC nationals' applications for permanent residence  already lodged, (as it has done with the 7 cases already).

 2. retain the right to temporary entry permit for those who are eligible to  apply for permanent residence on humanitarian grounds but have so far  chosen not to apply;

 3. retain the right to apply for refugee status through the DORS  committee for those who are not eligible to apply for permanent residence  on humanitarian grounds.

 4. allow other PRC nationals here at 20 June on extended TEP for 4 - 5  years with work, study and travel rights.
