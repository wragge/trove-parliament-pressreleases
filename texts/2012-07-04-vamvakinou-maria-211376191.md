 Media Release:

 Hume fights poverty and joblessness

 4 July 2012

 Senator the Hon Kim Carr Minister for Human Services

 Maria Vamvakinou MP Member for Calwell

 The Gillard Labor Government and local community groups have joined  forces to strengthen education opportunities and tackle unemployment in  Hume.

 Minister for Human Services Senator Kim Carr today announced $523,586  for 10 projects, including $96,000 to the Salvation Army to develop a 

 program to train and mentor young parents and jobless families in the  retail sector. 

 "It's exciting to see so many local community groups come forward with  innovative ideas to help improve the lives of people in Hume," Senator Kim  Carr said. 

 Local MP Maria Vamvakinou welcomed the announcement, saying it's a  great example of how government and communities can work together to  ensure support is provided to the people who need it most.

 "I look forward to seeing locals feel the benefits of these initiatives - such  as the "Opportunities in Family Day Care' program which will see newly 

 arrived refugees and migrants trained in family day care," Ms Vamvakinou  said.

 "And the Ignition project will assist people with training for their driver's  license - a huge step for many people towards finding and keeping a job.

 "Other projects focus on paths to work for young people, like the Holy  Child Primary School's proposal, where school kids and their families visit  universities.

 "Overall, community organisations will work with 55 schools in Hume and  with hundreds of individuals."

 Chair of the Local Advisory Group Rob Hudson said the aim of the projects  is to ensure the residents of Hume can gain access to training and job 

 opportunities.

 "We focused on what Hume needed to connect people to the workforce  and give them an opportunity to develop career paths," he said. 

 "These projects support people who need to build foundation skills, as well  as those who already have workplace skills but need assistance to 

 overcome other barriers to employment like language or needing a drivers  licence."

 Background

 The Local Solutions Fund is part of Better Futures, Local Solutions, the  Australian Government's new approach of empowering communities to  identify their own solutions to joblessness and poverty. The Local Solutions  Fund provides $25 million across 10 locations from 2012-2015 for 

 innovative and creative solutions to increase social and economic  participation.

 This program will provide approximately the same amount of money to  each of the 10 Local Government areas. The recommendations were  overseen by the National Place Based Advisory Group.

 Local Advisory Groups have been established in the 10 Local  Government Areas. They are the cornerstone of the initiative and identify  innovative practical projects to address local needs and provide an  important advisory mechanism to government.

 Local Advisory Groups, made up of a range of community representatives, 

 carefully considered all of the applications and selected the projects they  thought best suited the needs of their communities and made  recommendations to the Minister of Human Services, Senator Kim Carr.

 Senator Kim Carr approved the Local Advisory Group recommendations  and announced successful projects in each of the 10 selected Local  Government Areas.

 The following table provides an overview of the projects approved for the  Hume community.
