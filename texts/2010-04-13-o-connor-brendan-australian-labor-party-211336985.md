 PEOPLE SMUGGLER CHARGED BY AFP   

 (13 April 2010) Minister for Home Affairs, Brendan O’Connor, today praised the work of the  Australian Federal Police (AFP) for charging a Sri Lankan man with people smuggling. 

 The man is due to appear in Perth Central Law Court today for allegedly attempting to  facilitate the illegal arrival of 54 people into Australia on a vessel which arrived in September  last year. 

 “People smuggling is a world-wide problem and Australia is committed to working closely  with our neighbours to address the issue,” Mr O’Connor said. 

 The AFP continues to provide support to foreign law enforcement agencies in their efforts to  combat people smuggling activities in the region. These close working relationships have  resulted in a number of arrests and disruptions to people smuggling ventures in countries such  as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka. 

 “Since September 2008 authorities in Indonesia have disrupted 131 potential ventures,  arrested 61 people smuggling facilitators and prevented 3505 foreign nationals from  travelling onwards to Australia,” Mr O’Connor said. 

 The maximum penalty for people smuggling offences is 20 years imprisonment and/or a  $220,000 fine. 

  

 “The charging of this man brings the total number of people charged by the AFP with people  smuggling offences in Australia since September 2008 to 133, which is a significant  achievement for the AFP and the Australian Government,” Mr O’Connor said.
