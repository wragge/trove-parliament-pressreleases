  Senator Andrew Bartlett 

  Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson 

  Howard Government seeks to silence! 

  ‘bashled’ detainees? 

  The Australian Democrats are demanding that Minister Ruddock investigate allegations   of physical abuse of several Chinese asylum seekers by Australasian Correctional   Management (ACM) staff, in Sydney’s Villawood Detention Centre. 

  Australian Democrats Spokesperson for Immigration, Senator Andrew Bartlett said, “It has been alleged tha   ACM staff, without the assistance of an interpreter, forcibly removed and bashed a number of detainees on 2 7   April 200 1 during a transfer within the Villawood Detention C$entre. 

  “Detainees report that unnecessary force was used against a number of their group by ACM staff. From then.   accounts they were systematically removed from their dormitory and allegedly ‘bashed up’ during a transfer,”   Senator Bartlett said. 

  “Some of them suffered serious wounds dL.ring the incident. One detainee, allegedly offering no resistance,   describes how he was dragged along a corridor by his hair for a distance of 30 metres. It is further alleged that   following this incident appropriate medica. treatment was withheld or delayed. 

  “A number of detainees involved in this incident are now facing deportation from Australia. One such detaillee   has apparently been informed that he will be deported within the next 72 hours.” 

  Senator Bartlett continued, “Such serious allegations need to be fully investigated, but detainees are too   frightened to speak the truth for fear of deportation and persecution. This group is among the first to come   forward, knowing the possible consequences of their actions. 

  “It seems their fears have been justly realised. 

  “I urge the Minister for Immigration to conduct a full inquiry in the circumstances surrounding this event th;it   left these detainees injured. 

  “I further urge Mr Ruddock to ensure that ~11 detainees involved will be able to raise their allegations formally,   and not be deported before all legal avenues have been exhausted.” 

  “To guarantee this I would urge Minister Ruddock to issue visas to the detainees for the duration of the   investigation.
