 ADJOURNMENT DEBATE SPEECH ON MYANMAR    

 SENATE, CANBERRA    

 TUESDAY, 17 OCTOBER 2017 

 Last week in Adelaide I met with members of Bangladeshi community and I was  pleased to receive this petition from them.     

 The Federal Opposition is deeply concerned at reports of human rights abuses in  Myanmar and the resulting humanitarian crisis currently facing Bangladesh. The  international community and people here in Australia have been shocked by horrific  stories and images coming out of Myanmar and Bangladesh.     

 Over the past few days I, or my office, have received briefings from a range of  organisations — MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res, Save the Children, CARE Australia, Oxfam,  APHEDA and UNICEF—and today I met with Wai Wai Nu, a peace and women's rights  activist from Myanmar. I would like to thank these groups and individuals for taking the  time to send representation to Canberra and brief parliamentarians and their offices on  the crisis in Myanmar and Bangladesh.    

 We see a humanitarian crisis of catastrophic proportions. It is one of the fastest growing  refugee crises in recent years. Over half a million Rohingya refugees have fled their  homes in Myanmar since violence erupted in late August. Most of them are now living  near the Bangladeshi city of Cox's Bazar, which borders Myanmar. The entire land area  of the camps and informal settlements, which is about 10 square kilometres in size, is  simply not equipped for the influx in population and is under severe strain in terms of  resources, infrastructure and space.     

 Reports of violent attacks against the Rohingya community in Rakhine State have been  corroborated by international NGOs and medical evidence. Having arrived with very few  possessions or savings, the Rohingya population in Cox's Bazar is dependent on 

 humanitarian assistance for basic services. It is a population which is highly vulnerable,  and the risk of an outbreak of disease is high.    

 United Nations officials have described the crimes committed against the Rohingya as  'a textbook example of ethnic cleansing' and Human Rights Watch has called them  'crimes against humanity'.     

 The Opposition has made formal representations to the Prime Minister and the foreign  minister, and we continue to urge the Australian Government to do everything it can to  respond to this escalating crisis and to speak out on human rights. In particular, we call  on the Government to pledge further funds to aid those affected by the violence in  Rakhine State at the donor pledging conference in Geneva on 23 October.     

 We call for the full implementation of the Kofi Annan report and the Advisory  Commission on Rakhine State recommendations, which seek to prevent violence,  maintain peace and foster reconciliation. We call on the Government to work to  establish an independent UN investigation into human rights abuses in Myanmar and to  continue holding the Government of Myanmar to account, especially the military, for its  conduct and for its continued obligation to respect the human rights of all its people. We  call for the Government to support unimpeded humanitarian access to the camps in  Bangladesh and to work closely with regional partners on a medium- and long-term  response to the refugee crisis, seeking to ensure that the Rohingya population has a  secure place to live in peace.    

 Australia and the Australian community have a deep affection for Myanmar. We have  assisted Myanmar through economic reform, peace negotiations and its complex  transition to democracy. We have watched its transitions and its democracy project with  hope. In the face of this current escalating crisis we urge the Government of Myanmar  to recommit to pursue peace and national reconciliation. We offer our full support for  efforts to achieve sustained peace and genuine reconciliation.     

 The situation presents the State Counsellor and Nobel laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi,  and the Government more broadly, an opportunity to exercise moral authority to protect  the human rights of its citizens and to mediate a peaceful resolution to the current crisis.  We believe it is in Myanmar's own interests for this conflict to be responded to fairly and  resolved peacefully.
