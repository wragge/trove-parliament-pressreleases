 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Friday, 25 July 2014   

 Morrison’s real failure is his refusal to treat refugees as human, Greens   

 The Abbott Government must commit to quickly and fairly processing the asylum claims  of 157 Tamils who will reach the Australian mainland, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “The Immigration Minister is a spectacular failure by his own measure, as well as the  measure of the international community and decent, caring Australians,” the Greens’  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “The Abbott Government has created this debacle themselves by acting illegally and  failing to treat refugees as human beings with dignity.   

 “The government has spent weeks showing nothing but contempt for the Parliament, the  courts, the asylum seekers on this boat and the Australian people’s right to know.   

 “This shameful spectacle, that has seen the government making up cruel policy on the  run, will continue until the people on this boat are offered genuine and permanent  protection.   

 “After the traumatic experience that the children on this boat have been put through, the  Abbott Government must give assurances that they won’t be sent to Nauru or Christmas  Island.   

 “The Abbott Government must guarantee that the people on this boat will be given  access to their lawyers.   

 “The protection claims of all 157 Tamil asylum seekers on this boat must now be  processed fairly and quickly on the Australian mainland.”
