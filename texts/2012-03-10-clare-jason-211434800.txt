 MORE EVIDENCE ABBOTT’S TOW-BACKS PUTS LIVES  AT RISK   

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare MP, today said the Coalition remained in denial about its âturn back the  boatsâ policy despite the ever mounting evidence against the dangerous practice.   

 A recent report released under FoI by Australia's Border Protection Command, as reported in  The Australian today, reveals further proof of the dangerous and impractical nature of Tony  Abbottâs plan to tow back asylum seeker boats to Indonesia.   

 The report confirms that the policy puts the lives of Australian Defence Force personnel and  asylum seekers at risk, saying tow backs would lead asylum seekers to “exhibit non-compliant behaviour” and “Australian Defence Force personnel tasked to implement this  policy proposal will be exposed to additional hazards”.   

 "Past experiences indicate this could include deliberately lit fires, improvised weapons,  potential physical assault and increased risks to the safety of personnel required to rescue  (asylum-seekers) who jump overboard,”  the report states.   

 The report follows recent comments against the policy by United Nations High Commissioner  for Refugees Antonio Guterres and the Indonesian Ambassador to Australia Primo Alui  Joelianto.   

 Mr Bowen said Tony Abbott's turn back the boats policy was dangerous and typically ignored  all expert advice.   

 “Mr Abbottâs bloody-mindedness is astounding - he and Scott Morrison arrogantly spruik a  tow-back policy that our Navy and Border Protection authorities say is dangerous and risks  lives,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “This is a policy the United Nationsâ refugee chief said breaches the Refugee Convention; a  policy that was recently found to be illegal in the European Court of Human Rights.   

 “Crucially, even Indonesia - the very country Mr Abbott wants to tow the boats back to -  has made it crystal clear on a number of occasions that it will not agree to the policy.” 

 

 Mr Clare said Mr Abbott was pushing a policy that would put the lives of Australians at risk.   

 “Itâs been savaged by everyone from the former Chief of the Defence Force to the  Indonesian national police,” Mr Clare said.   

 “Most importantly though, it has been savaged by the Australian men and women who  would have to do this job. Why? Because it puts their lives at risk.”   

 This is what a senior naval officer said earlier this year: “They will disable their boats when  they see us coming, they will burn their boats. The policy will encourage them to do so and  it will place lives - navy lives and refugee lives - at risk.”  (The Australian, 25 January 2012)   

 “This is a reckless and dangerous policy. Especially when you can achieve the same thing by  picking people up and flying them to Malaysia,” Mr Clare said.   

 Comments on the Coalitionâs tow-back policy include:   

 “We have clearly opposed pushbacks in the Italian case in the Mediterranean in the recent  past before the Libyan crisis, and we think that that is clearly a violation in relation to the  '51 Convention.”  United Nations' High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio  Guterres (7.30 ABC, 13 February 2012)   

 "…there are risks involved in this whole endeavour. There were incidents during these  activities, as there have been incidents subsequently, which have been risky.”   "There have been fires lit, there have been attempts to storm the engine compartment of  these boats. There have been people jumping in the water, that sort of thing. Admiral Ray  Griggs (Senate Estimates, 19 October 2011)   

 “Yes actually, I called Tony Abbottâs political advisor … Then he explained to me that itâs  actually the policy of the Coalition. But when I told him that if you take that policy, it means  that you bring all the burdens to Indonesia and what about our cooperation?”  Primo Alui Joelianto , Indonesian Ambassador to Australia (Newsline, Australia  Network, 5 March 2012)   

 "It's unworkable legally but it's also unworkable from a practical perspective because we  now have a lot of experience in knowing that even if boats are turned back they will quickly  be sabotaged.”  Dan Rothwell, International Law expert, ANU (The Australian, 25  January 2012)   

 “Simply pushing back boats to where they have come from would be a backward step”.    “The general concept of pushing boats back and forth would be an aberration to the general  consensus that has been established since 2003.”  Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty  Natalegawa (Sydney Morning Herald on 8 March, 2010)
