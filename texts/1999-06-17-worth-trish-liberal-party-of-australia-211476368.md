  Media Release

  The Hon Trish Worth, MP

  Parliamentary Secretary to

  the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs

  

  

  ADDITIONAL HELP FOR DISADVANTAGED

  YOUNG AUSTRALIANS TO 2003

  

  Young people at risk of homelessness and other disadvantaged youth 
wi ll benefit from $60 million to continue the Job Placement, 
Education Training Program (JPET) that helps them to overcome barriers 
to finding work, gaining stable accommodation, re-entering the education 
system or accessing training, the Parliamentary Secretary for Education, 
Training and Youth Affairs, Ms Trish Worth said today.

  

 The continuation of funding means that the Job Placement 
Education and Training Program will receive Government support until 
at least 2003.

  

 In 1999-2000 more than 13,000 young people who are 
homeless, or at risk of becoming homeless, who are ex-offenders, refugees 
or who are wards of the State will be able to seek assistance from any 
one of the 138 Commonwealth funded JPET services.

  

 “An extra 36 agencies operating throughout metropolitan 
and regional locations in Australia will be offered contracts under 
the 1999-2000 JPET program which has already assisted over 11,000 young 
people in 1998-1999” Ms Worth said.

  

 “JPET’s flexible and integrated approach to meeting 
the needs of young people at risk of homelessness, domestic violence 
and/or alcohol and drug abuse underpins its success and has made a significant 
difference to the many thousands of disadvantaged young Australians 
it has helped to date”. Ms Worth said.

  

 “I am pleased to announce both an increase in the 
number of places that will be made available to 15 to 21 year olds and 
an increase in the number of JPET service providers that will operate 
throughout metropolitan and regional locations in Australia”.

  

 JPET provides support and referral services for young 
people who face major barriers to accommodation, education, training 
and/or employment.

  

 The breadth of the services offered by JPET providers 
ensures that the specific hurdles faced by each young person are appropriately 
addressed.

  

 “It confirms this Government’s commitment to assisting 
disadvantaged youth ensuring that they have the opportunities and pathways 
to share in a meaningful and sustainable future,” Ms Worth said.
