  Media Release

  

  SENATOR THE HON RICHARD ALSTON

  Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts

  

  Internet content advisory board announced

  

  The board for NetAlert, Australia's new community advisory body on 
Internet content, was announced  today by the Minister for Communications, 
Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston. 

  

 NetAlert is an independent body established as part 
of the Commonwealth Government's commitment to educating communities 
about managing access to online content,' Senator Alston said. 

  

 'NetAlert will be responsible for researching new 
access management technologies and running national awareness campaigns 
to promote a safer Internet experience for young people. 

  

 'Concerned community members will be able to ask NetAlert 
for advice about how to manage access to the Internet,' Senator Alston 
said. 

  

 The inaugural 11 member NetAlert Board is made up 
of industry, legal, community and educational organisation representatives 
from around the country, and will be chaired by Ms Karyn Hart. 

  

 'Ms Hart comes to the position with a wealth of experience 
in the secondary education sector,' Senator Alston said. 

  

 'Currently the Principal of Rochedale State High School, 
Ms Hart was previously the President of both the Queensland and the 
Australian Secondary Principals' Associations.' 

  

 Full details of the NetAlert Board members announced 
today are attached. There will be further announcements at a later date, 
as the Government is currently finalising arrangements to expand the 
Board's membership by adding two members with a strong regional background. 

  

 Establishing an education and advisory body was an 
important part of the Government's policy when amending the   Broadcasting Services Act 1992 , to take account of objectionable 
material online. 

  

 The new regulatory framework aims to make material 
that is illegal in traditional media also illegal in the online environment. 
It encourages the development of industry codes of practice to help 
users manage their access to the Internet. It will also allow concerned 
community members to contact the Australian Broadcasting Authority about 
material they think is illegal. 

  

 NetAlert is an additional measure that will play an 
important role by empowering parents to take control of the Internet, 
so that they can feel confident about their children going online. 

  

 Established with $3 million from the Telstra social 
bonus funding, NetAlert's office will be in Hobart, Tasmania. 

  

 'The establishment of NetAlert is an important step 
in helping families manage their children's access to the Internet,' 
Senator Alston said.
