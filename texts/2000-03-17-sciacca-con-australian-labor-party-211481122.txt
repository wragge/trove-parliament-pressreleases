  Migration Institute Of Australia Annual Conference

  

  Con Sciacca - Shadow Minister for Immigration

  

  Address - Wesley Centre, Sydney - 17 March 2000

  

  Check Against Delivery

  

  Thank you for the opportunity to address your 
conference for the second year in a row in my capacity as Shadow Minister 
for Immigration.

  

  Let me start this year by reaffirming an old 
political saying, which may sound like a cliche, but believe me still 
rings true after 35 years of political life - 'A WEEK IS A LONG TIME 
IN POLITICS'. And if a week is a long time in politics, a year is an 
eternity.

  

  The ongoing immigration debate

  

  I say this because over the last year, if we 
are to believe the media, we have witnessed what at first glance seems 
to be a complete shift in the mindset and the attitude of the Prime 
Minister on the issue of immigration and population.

  

  The Australian newspaper's headline of March 
4 claiming that the PM is open to a higher immigration program, while 
I believe was little more than an overzealous interpretation of the 
PM's response on the part of the journalist, nevertheless signals a 
possible shift in the PM's long standing reluctance to accept the benefits 
of immigration and multiculturalism.

  

  Following the disastrous anti-Asian and anti-multicultural 
comments made by Howard at the height of the Hanson era, the Prime Minister 
seems to have, dare I say "rolled back" his antipathy.

  

  You will recall that late last year the Prime 
Minister launched a report compiled by the National Multicultural Advisory 
Council, chaired by Neville Roach AO, promoting the benefits of a culturally 
diverse Australian society.

  

  Until then, of course the PM was not known as 
a supporter of multiculturalism and cultural diversity. During the launch 
of the report he even managed to utter the "M" word for the 
first time or second time - a grand feat in itself.

  

  These sudden changes in the Prime Minister's 
thinking, leading to many of his unilateral policy decisions, have often 
left Minister Ruddock stranded and looking quite silly.

  

  He was certainly stranded when the Prime Minister 
decided to allow the 4,000 Kosovars into Australia and then left him 
the task of getting rid of them, quite unceremoniously a few months 
later.

  

  Indeed the small number of Kosovars there are 
still here - and we are talking about no more than a couple of hundred 
- are now being bundled up and sent away - possibly by force - in a 
couple of weeks time.

  

  Until recently, the Minister was beating his 
chest and telling anyone that would listen that his migration program 
was appropriate and properly balanced, and that:

  

  â¢ Any increase in migration would be detrimental 

  â¢ That there weren't enough skilled migrants 
who wanted to come to this Country 

  â¢ That Australia did not need a population debate, 
let alone a population policy. 

  

  The next morning, following the PM's comments, 
on the Seven Network's Sunset program, the Minister flagged that Australia's 
skilled migrant intake could rise as early as next year - Where did 
the skilled migrants suddenly materialise from? - I wonder!!

  

  The question you may now ask is - How will these 
latest developments further the debate?

  

  Well, first of all I welcome this apparent change 
in policy and I certainly welcome the reopening of the debate on the 
part of the Government.

  

  Until last week it was the Labor Opposition that 
pushed the envelope, bit the bullet and promoted a higher immigration 
and moderately higher population policy.

  

  Just prior to your last conference, held in March 
1999, I took the step of announcing my intention to argue within my 
Party and the general community what was described on page 1 of the 
Australian, at the time, as a 'high risk policy switch'.

  

  The fact is that good policy is not always popular 
policy and the choice I made, and the risk I took in re-igniting the 
migration debate I believe has paid off and will continue with sound 
and reasoned argument to gain acceptance among Australians.

  

  Immigration and population are issues of national 
importance and the community has a reasonable expectation of leadership 
from its elected representatives when being informed in these areas.

  

  Until now, the Government had vacillated between 
a non-policy of populist rhetoric displayed in the PM's anti immigration 
and anti-Asian remarks and a 'head in the sand' attitude, again displayed 
by the PM with his decision of not even mentioning the word 'multiculturalism' 
until just very recently.

  

  Such attitudes from the National leadership are 
unhelpful and irresponsible at best and contemptuous of the Australian 
public at worst.

  

  At least, the Government has now taken some ownership 
of this debate, albeit reluctantly, and we can proceed in a bi-partisan 
and constructive fashion - with both national leaders seemingly publicly 
committed to these vital issues.

  

  This portfolio is shaping up to be very intense 
and with each meeting I attend around Australia and each letter I receive, 
I become more and more convinced that it needs a change of culture, 
a vision and in some areas a heart transplant.

  

  Every area of the immigration portfolio I examine 
bear deep scars of the funding cuts and restrictions that have characterised 
the Howard Government over the past four years.

  

  Last year in various speeches I outlined the 
broad vision I have for the immigration portfolio. I spoke about the 
departmental culture that this Minister has created, where, if you can 
cut, privatise, restrict and in some cases discriminate, then you are 
seen as having performed well among your peers.

  

  I have intervened in many cases where I believed 
the decision making was inconsistent, unreasonable and often too harsh. 
To the Minister's credit, on many occasions he has reversed the department's 
initial decision. It is clear to me that the department is often confused 
and applies Ministerial directions too rigidly.

  

  A perfect example, is my opposition to the overzealous 
use of the 'High Risk Factor List of Countries' when deciding visitor 
and temporary entry visas. I agree that we need to be aware of problem 
areas in terms of possible visa overstay, and we need to be prudent 
about who is allowed into Australia.

  

  However, I cannot condone what I believe often 
amounts to the categorical exclusion of people from entering into Australia 
just because their profile in terms of age sex and nationality is part 
of a list.

  

  People smuggling

  

  Even in the area of illegal immigration and people 
smuggling, the Government would have been losing this battle if it had 
not been for Labor's insistence over the last twelve months for the 
Minister to look beyond questionable domestic laws. 

  

  For over a year, Labor has insisted that the 
Minister engage the people smugglers at the source - in the Countries 
where they operate - diplomatically and politically, by building long-term 
relationships and entering into co-operation protocols.

  

  People smuggling and illegal immigration is an 
international problem and it needs an international solution.

  

  To his credit the Minister finally agreed and 
undertook a number of overseas visits, and I have no doubt that his 
actions will pay dividends in the long run. On my part, I kept my word 
that I would not criticise him for undertaking too many overseas trips.

  

  This year, as I continue our policy development 
process, I can be a little more specific on the direction I believe 
is necessary to correct the many shortcomings in this important portfolio.

  

  Higher immigration/population

  

  Firstly, is Labor's commitment to a moderate 
increase in Australia's population, both via a possible higher immigration 
program and with family friendly social policies being developed by 
my parliamentary Front Bench colleagues.

  

  Kim Beazley in recent speeches including the 
Hawke Institute address in South Australia late last year, outlined 
the process by which Labor will establish an Office of Population and 
engage demographers to plan to determine Australia's optimal population 
level.

  

  Labor will use these experts' higher estimates 
to set achievable and realistic immigration targets.

  

  Also, Labor will address the current exercise 
of setting year by year immigration intake numbers and redress Minister 
Ruddock's farcical round of annual consultation which has become little 
more than a well staged Public Relation event.

  

  These 'public meeting' have plenty of fancy special 
effects, computer presentations and colourful slides, but precious little 
useful information or substantial debate - and incidentally, the Minister 
tends to hold these meetings in marginal Liberal constituencies around 
Australia.

  

  Immigration levels should be set on a long-term 
basis and should be impervious of economic and political cycles. Realistic 
immigration levels must be set in a flexible framework that can be tailored 
to the nation's requirements - Five years is what Labor suggests.

  

  Program administration

  

  In terms of Program administration, Labor is 
committed to administering a fairer and more balanced immigration program.

  

  I believe that the current ratio of roughly 50% 
skilled migration and 50% family reunion is about right - however - 
it is within the subcategories that we will try to restore fairness 
and dignity.

  

  We will certainly not condone a situation where 
there is currently a 40 year waiting list of some 25,000 aged relatives, 
while the Department still happily accepts applications and fees of 
up to $1000 each - this is tantamount to deception at worst and negligence 
towards hopeful families at best.

  

  Non discriminatory immigration policy

  

  Labor's policy of non-discrimination will continue 
and it will be implemented at all levels within the immigration portfolio.

  

  As a priority, I will address and examine the 
current policies and procedures for granting visitor and tourist visas. 
This is a subject that I touched on briefly in my address to the Queensland 
MIA conference last.

  

  I am very disappointed by the Immigration Department's 
overzealous use of the so-called 'high risk factor list of countries'. 
This is a list that should be used merely as a guide to assist decision-makers 
when assessing visitor visa applications, in conjunction with a number 
of other considerations.

  

  Instead this now infamous list, I believe has 
virtually become the sole criterion for temporary entry into Australia. 
Just to give you a few examples, those who attract suspicion when applying 
for visitors' visas include:

  

  â¢ Greek males aged 20-39 + 60 years and above 

  â¢ Greek females aged 20-29 + 50 years and above 

  â¢ Lebanese males and females from age of 20 
onwards. 

  

  And the list goes on to include another 41 countries, 
including Chile, Croatia, Egypt, India, Israel, Peru, Poland, Turkey 
and so on.

  

  As I mentioned earlier, It is very hard for Labor 
to tolerate a list such as this where people are being effectively discriminated 
on age, sex and country of origin. 

  

  Having said that, at all times Labor will seek 
to maintain the integrity of the migration programs.

  

  Our approach will be tough but it will be flexible 
and above all it will be fair.

  

  Still on temporary stay, and again a topic of 
some interest in recent weeks, Labor will review the system of temporary 
entry visas in order to prevent the establishment of a semi permanent 
group of guest workers, on short but renewable visas.

  

  In view of recent events where employers are 
using illegal immigrants as cheap labour, we will ensure that programs 
such as the Working Holiday-Makers Scheme do not become de-facto labour 
market programs.

  

  Being soft on employers of illegal workers and 
turning a blind eye to temporary visitors in the job market, will only 
harm the already few opportunities available to young unskilled Australians 
looking for a way out of the unemployment cycle.

  

  Migrant settlement in regional areas

  

  A key area of Labor's population and immigration 
policy will focus on innovative strategies and incentives to encourage 
newly arrived migrants to settle in regional Australia.

  

  Labor acknowledges that Australia's larger cities 
are reaching their limit in terms of carrying capacity while at the 
same time many regional centres are depleted of both population and 
resources.

  

  Along with my parliamentary colleague Martin 
Ferguson in his capacity as Shadow Minister for Regional Development 
I am examining initiatives and incentives to encourage newly arrived 
migrants to settle, and make long term contributions in regional areas.

  

  Humanitarian program

  

  As we have witnessed over the past year, unrest 
is increasing around the World and volatile situations in many countries 
often spill over into armed conflicts. As this pattern will no doubt 
continue in future years, Australia is guaranteed to be called upon 
to provide assistance, refuge and leadership at any given time.

  

  Australia currently manages one of the World's 
most generous organised humanitarian and refugee programs, 12,000 per 
year.

  

  This program is under enormous strain at the 
present time given the constant flow of illegal arrivals, many of which 
have genuine refugee claims that automatically engage Australia's international 
obligations.

  

  As a response to this new challenge, the Minister 
has once again decided to overact in the abrupt fashion that we have 
become used to over recent months.

  

  Minister Ruddock has completely frozen the offshore 
component of the refugee program, which is around 10,000 places to compensate 
for the illegal arrivals that have had to be processed on-shore and 
in expectation of future arrivals, which may or may not eventuate.

  

  This is an unfair situation for those genuine 
refugees that have been waiting often for years in UNHCR camps around 
the World for a place on Australia' program.

  

  Further, this overaction by the Minister will 
send the worst possible signals to those asylum seekers who are trying 
to do the right thing and gain a place on Australia's humanitarian program 
by lawful means.

  

  As I said in Parliament a couple of weeks ago, 
this Ministerial direction sends out the worst possible message in terms 
of deterring illegal immigrants and people smugglers.

  

  What it says in effect is that if people can 
get to this country by illegal means, they have a better chance of being 
granted a visa - albeit for only three years - than if they apply legally 
from overseas or wait their turn in UNHCR camps.

  

  The problem is that this Minister, having slashed 
virtually every facet of the migration program, cannot resist the temptation 
to cut one of the last remaining areas of his portfolio which has remained 
largely intact.

  

  Under a Labor Government, first of all we would 
not panic and overact as the Government seems to do whenever a new emergency 
presents itself.

  

  Secondly, we would ensure that our international, 
hard won reputation as a generous and humanitarian country is maintained 
by ensuring that the integrity of the refugee and humanitarian program 
is kept intact.

  

  Lastly, we would actively plan for contingencies 
and ensure that the program is managed in a flexible way, without necessarily 
increasing it. 

  

  We must remember that the refugee program by 
definition is designed to cater for the consequences of World events 
and these events often change on a daily basis, therefore we cannot 
afford to freeze it, penalise it, quarantine it or tamper with it. It 
must be flexible and it must be generous.

  

  Conclusion

  

  In conclusion, I assure you that the Opposition 
will continue to push for an informed immigration debate.

  

  No matter how flimsy the Prime Minister's comments 
may have been last week when he was cornered to provide in-principle 
support for an open debate and the possibility of a higher immigration 
policy, we will not let either him or the Minister forget it.

  

  Immigration and population issues are vital to 
our future development as a nation and cannot be dealt by seven-second 
television grabs or sideway comments on a newspaper.

  

  An informed debate, as promoted by the Opposition 
and alluded to by the Prime Minister, is the only way to place the full 
range of options and information in front of the Australian people.
