 The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Bill *  Hayden, M.P., 

 today announced that Australia was contributing $1.045 

 million to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 

 (UNHCR) following an appeal for assistance for Ethiopian 

 refugees in Somalia.

 Mr Hayden said that since December 1985 about 71,000 

 Ethiopians had entered north-west Somalia and were being  accommodated at a transit centre near the border. There  were severe and immediate food shortages as well as an 

 urgent need for better facilities, for example drinking 

 water has to be trucked in from about 50 km away.

 UNHCR hopes soon to obtain permission from the Somali 

 Government to relocate the refugees in more suitable sites. 

 Funds for trucks to enable such movement have been included 

 in the latest UNHCR appeal.

 Mr Hayden said that Australia's assistance consisted of

 an $800,000 accountable cash grant for the purchase of 

 food and an accountable cash grant of $245,000 for other 

 relief needs, such as medical supplies and trucks.

 Mr Hayden said that this financial year the Australian 

 Government would contribute a total of $31.495 million 

 in food and emergency humanitarian assistance to Africa.

 The grant forms part of the Australian Government's 

 humanitarian response to disaster situations throughout 

 the world, and is provided from aid funds administ red by 

 the Australian Development Assistance Bureau.
