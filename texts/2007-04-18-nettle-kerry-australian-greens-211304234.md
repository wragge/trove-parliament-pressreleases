 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 

 Cuban solution -'bizarre political stunt' 

 18th Apr 07 

 Greens Immigration spokesperson Senator Kerry Nettle today called on the government to stop 

 using asylum seekers as political pawns and agree to resettle refugees in Australia. 

 

 "This latest move to send refugees who come to Australia by boat to the USA in exchange for 

 Cuban migrants held in Guantanamo bay is simply bizarre," Senator Nettle said. 

 

 "Giving asylum seekers a fast track to a Green Card is hardly a deterrent to people smugglers as 

 the Prime Minister claims. 

 

 "This is an outrages political stunt that uses asylum seekers as political pawns. 

 

 "The government's logic is so twisted when it comes to refugees that it defies understanding. 

 

 "The Government is now prepared to take Cubans who are overwhelmingly economic migrants 

 in exchange for Sri Lankans who are refugees in fear of their lives. 

 

 "The Greens are happy to see more Cubans travelling to Australia but to see them take the 

 places of refugees we have intercepted at sea is hardly the way to do it. 

 

 "This madness must end. The government should take the small number of refugees who seek 

 asylum in Australia by boat and if there is a need to accommodate Cuban migrants then that 

 should be done through appropriate migration visas. 

 

 "All of this still leaves Nauru to deal with sea bound asylum seekers and still leaves Australia in 

 breach of the international refugee conventions is has signed up to."
