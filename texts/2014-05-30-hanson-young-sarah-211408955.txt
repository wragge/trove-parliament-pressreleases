 MEDIA RELEASE

 Ideological axe taken to Refugee Council of Australia   

 The Abbott Government’s decision to cut the entirety of Federal funding to the Refugee  Council of Australia is a senseless attack on the non-government sector, the Australian  Greens have said.   

 “It’s very disappointing that the Abbott Government’s ideological axe has fallen on the  Refugee Council of Australia,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young said.   

 “This spiteful cut is just the latest in a long line of attacks on groups who don’t always  agree with the government.   

 “It seems that anyone who doesn’t subscribe to Tony Abbott’s view of the world is  staring down the barrel of these narrow-minded cuts.   

 “The Refugee Council of Australia represents many groups and agencies and it carries  out essential work supporting refugees in the community.   

 “With this cut in funding, even more pressure will be put on community and charity  organisations who are already struggling to cope.”
