 Sydney Institute Speech - 6 April 2004

 The Damage Done

 The damage done to Australia by a few who blindly and recklessly criticise our immigration policies

 In February this year, internationally famous Australian author, Thomas Keneally, in an article in The  Guardian, attacked his country as “xenophobic” and “opposed to entry of refugees”. 

 Mr Keneally joins a conga line of Australians prepared to disparage their country’s reputation internationally  in order to attack their old ideological foes.

 Monday’s papers carried similar criticism aired in Geneva by Howard Glenn from a lobby group that titles  itself “A Just Australia”. 

 The name chosen indicates that the body sees itself as “just” and equally sees anyone who disagrees with them  as being unjust. Indeed they set themselves up as the arbitrators of what is just. 

 This follows a trend amongst commentators in this area. They do not seek to have a conversation. Your view  or mine is irrelevant. They seek to place themselves as the arbiters of what is right and to lecture the rest of us  on their views. They seek to denigrate the makers of our current border control policy. They see themselves as  “we the righteous and principled” with the rest of us as unprincipled and ill informed. The wide public support  for our border control policy is nothing but an inconvenience.

 Such is the shallowness of much of the debate surrounding Australia’s immigration policy. 

 Most Australians are in no doubt that theirs is a tolerant country. Keneally’s conga line preaches its message  abroad, because they know it persuades no one in Australia but helpless children.

 The simple right and wrong picture fits easily into the emerging moral framework of children. Without  experience outside their own neighbourhood they may easily believe teachers and others in authority who tell  them there are Australians who don’t like foreigners or people of other races. The children are rightly horrified  by such an un-Australian thought. 

 If teachers tell them that there are hundreds of children locked in detention with no opportunity to play or  denied access to education, they will accept this at face value. If they are lucky enough to hear that the 

 Government denies such outrageousness, they are likely to be told, “of course, the Government would say  that, it is obviously lying.”

 Perhaps some children will think that if the Government is doing these things to the children of asylum  seekers then it must be all right. 

 Certainly, there is a risk that a small minority of bigots among the adult population will take heart from claims  that their Government is racist. They will feel that their views enjoy wide support. 

 The Keneally Conga line is making a big mistake. They are misleading the world and confusing Australian  children. The false view they peddle is based on overlooking three things:

 They ignore the facts of Australia’s substantial refugee and humanitarian programs.

 They ignore the fact that people smuggling is a rapidly growing international criminal activity that threatens to  overwhelm international processes for granting asylum to people fleeing persecution.

 And they ignore the risks that their constant refrain about Australia being xenophobic will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

 Reading Thomas Keneally’s article, you would never guess that in the past ten years, Australia has welcomed  over 100,000 people under our humanitarian program. 

 The majority of these people have come from overseas, mostly from refugee camps such as Kakuma in Kenya.

 The humanitarian program has always enjoyed broad-based community support in Australia.

 In fact, since the Second World War, Australia has provided a home to 620,000 refugees.

 Australians should be justly proud of this achievement. Not many other countries have opened their hearts to  people in need to the extent that Australia has.

 Of the countries that recognise the need for an international system to handle displaced people, we are the  third largest taker of refugees.

 Others may take more, but not willingly, not in a planned way. They take more because they can’t control  their borders.

 It is ironic that critics argue that the support enjoyed by the Government’s strong border control is based on  xenophobia. 

 To say that we are fearful of new arrivals is arrant nonsense.

 Over the past ten years, Australia has welcomed almost a million new arrivals. Almost a quarter of our  population is foreign-born. 

 Australia is the world’s best example of a peaceful, prosperous multicultural society.

 All Australians are saying is that we are happy to give people a fair go, if they abide by the rules.

 Migration - Skilled entry increase

 It is not only refugees who are welcome. Australians are not xenophobic, nor is their government.

 Labor’s last immigration intake in 1995-96 was 82,500. We expect this year’s to be 114,000 and next year’s  120,000. That’s effectively a 50% increase.

 Next year will see the largest ever intake of young skilled migrants. Nearly 80,000 new skilled migrants will  settle in Australia in 2004-05. Many will come here to live in our regional and rural areas. They will bring  their hopes and dreams with them.

 Australia is drawing skilled migrants like a magnet to its shores. That’s because our economy is strong, there  is demand for skilled labour, we live in peace and harmony and opportunities abound.

 The magnet has also attracted the unwanted attention of the modern scourge - the people smuggler.

 The problem of people smuggling and asylum seekers

 The global problem of people smuggling has emerged as a major international challenge.

 The IOM estimates that there are 30 to 40 million illegal immigrants worldwide. Annually, an estimated  500,000 illegal migrants enter Europe and another 700,000 enter the USA.

 The drivers of this criminal enterprise are obvious.

 Understandably people desperately want to travel to countries with better opportunities for themselves and  their families.

 Callous, greedy and unscrupulous people smugglers take advantage of this understandable desire. These  criminals charge exorbitant amounts to move people across borders to the country of their choice.

 That’s a critical point. Let me repeat it. People are using people smugglers not simply to escape persecution -  they are seeking to go to a country of their choice.

 Frequently they go through three or four countries of first asylum before getting to Australia. People requiring  protection should get it. However, they are not entitled to choose who hears their claim or where protection is  offered.

 The issue of people smuggling is clearly threatening the asylum regime established after the Second World  War.

 Under the UN Refugee Convention of 1951, unlawful entry cannot be a bar to a claim for asylum - a fact that  the UNHCR strongly insists is important. 

 But supporters of the Convention need to recognise, however, that people smuggling cannot be ignored  because it poses a serious threat to the whole asylum seeker process. 

 Spivs and criminals undermine the international system of protection because they deliver people who have  the cash to countries of their choice. These countries must then process them as refugees under the Convention  rules.

 A system that gives better outcomes to people with the dollars to pay people smugglers steadily undermines  the Convention.

 Australian policy is designed to strengthen the Convention. Under our system, all people who arrive here  without proper authority are detained until they are granted a visa, or leave Australia. 

 If a person makes a claim for asylum then their claim is independently assessed and, if approved, they are  released with a protection visa. 

 It is a fair system and an orderly system that protects Australia’s sovereignty. The majority of Australians  want such a system of border protection.

 Most Australians see no contradiction between controlling our borders and welcoming those in genuine need  from all over the world. Australians just want the system to be fair.

 People such as Keneally deride the term queue-jumper. There is no queue they say. Perhaps he should try  telling that to the thousands of refugees in Kakuma.

 People who attempt to jump the queue generally won’t win the respect of the Australian people.

 The Issue of Compassion

 The word compassion dominates Australian media coverage of the asylum seeker issue.

 Ironically, most refugee advocates spend of their time speaking about people who have been found not to be  refugees. 

 These advocates ignore people they have never met who are in camps such as Kakuma in Kenya. The plight of  these people is much greater than anyone in Australian seeking asylum yet there is little support for them from  noisy advocates.

 The so-called compassion of the noisy advocates is instead directed towards their wholly political task of  blackening Australia’s name as a nation that rejects refugees.

 The truth that the advocates and political commentators refuse to admit is that we continue to welcome all  genuine refugees.

 Indeed I recently announced a 50% increase in our annual refugee intake from July this year. This received  warm support across the board including from the Opposition.

 Despite the increase, Australia’s capacity to help refugees will always be limited. Any limited resource should  be allocated according to fairness and need. 

 Frequently asylum seekers who have been found not to be refugees take appeal after appeal. These people  have appealed and appealed right up to the High Court. 

 Over 90% of RRT decisions are upheld by the courts.

 Under these circumstances people, where it is safe to do so, ought to return to their homeland.

 Advocates who challenge any removal process are in fact arguing for an open door policy. 

 They are arguing that it is irrelevant whether or not you are determined, through a fair and transparent process,  to be a refugee or not, because you should be able to stay permanently, in any event.

 This is misplaced “compassion”. Australia cannot accept anyone and everyone who decides to arrive on our  shores. 

 We are a very generous people, but we will not be taken advantage of.

 Refugee advocates must understand the consequences of being a failed asylum seeker. Deciding who is a  refugee means accepting the consequences for those who are not.

 European response to asylum seekers

 In Europe many asylum seekers have had very weak claims for protection and failure rates of claims have  been high. 

 In most European countries, there have been few removals of failed asylum seekers. Europeans tend to  emphasise the importance of voluntary return.

 In Germany, for example, there were about 1.6 million claims for asylum between 1992 and 2002. All western  European nations have experienced very large numbers of people entering their territory and subsequently  either seeking asylum or remaining unlawfully.

 If failed asylum seekers are not removed, then there is really no need for an assessment process.

 In recent years, if you make it to a western European country you could, in most cases, stay.

 Up to now, the Europeans have made a virtue out of necessity.

 They cannot easily prevent arrivals nor remove people, so they describe their response as an exercise in  compassion. 

 They also describe it as upholding the Convention. 

 Things are changing, however. And quite dramatically.

 The Europeans are quietly following Australia’s lead.

 The Netherlands, a past champion of the Convention, has been making changes. 

 In February this year the Dutch Parliament legislated to introduce involuntary removal for an estimated 26,000  failed asylum seekers who arrived after 2001. Some still have avenues of appeal open, but they now know that  involuntary removal stands at the end of the process. 

 The Dutch have even proposed to set up “departure centres” to assist with the removal process.

 France has also announced an extension of detention times, speeding up of processing and to provide one year  subsidiary protection for some people who don’t meet the Convention standards. 

 The U.K. has introduced detention for certain illegal migrants and has recently announced a small refugee  resettlement program to accept people through the front door.

 Again the general direction of change is clear. The Europeans have decided to act to save the UN Convention  on Refugees from becoming meaningless.

 Without a strong Convention, with rules and consequences, the entire international asylum system faces  collapse. Awareness of this appears to be growing in Europe.

 Australia’s Response to Asylum Seeking

 Although Australia has not had the same numbers as European countries, our whole system faced serious  challenges in 2001.

 With no land borders, almost all lawful arrivals come through specified ports and airports.

 Australia has long sought to minimise unlawful entry. We have a different view of our borders because we are  an island continent.

 In response to the thousands of illegal boat arrivals a few years ago, the government acted decisively to stamp  out the people smuggling business.

 People smugglers have nothing to sell. They cannot guarantee landing their human cargo in Australia. 

 Our policies on temporary protection visas, mandatory detention of unlawful non-citizens and offshore  processing of asylum claims have all contributed to a very sharp decline in people smuggling.

 Of these policies, there is no doubt that offshore processing has had the greatest impact. 

 The inability to access Australia’s legal system and the prospect of resettlement in countries other than  Australia are significant disincentives to non-genuine asylum seekers.

 TPVs are also important because they provide fairness. They mean that the most valued contribution to  refugee problems that Australia can contribute - a permanent visa - is reserved for those most in need.

 I believe that Australians want an orderly migration system that is fair and within our capacity to support.

 People smugglers are the undermining enemy of a decent international system. Being strong against people  smugglers is standing up to support a decent international system for most in need.

 So what’s the damage done?

 Australia’s reputation is unfairly besmirched. Australians are not allowed to be proud of having one of the  most generous, open and non-discriminatory immigration policies in the world and perhaps worst of all, if  people are consistently told they’re racists and bigots - some might actually come to believe it.
