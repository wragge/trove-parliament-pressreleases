 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION  AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

 101/83 14 December 1983

 EASTBRIDGE MIGRANT CENTRE ACCOMMODATION UNITS TO CLOSE

 Refugees and migrants will no longer be accommodated at  Eastbridge Migrant Centre in M e l b o u r n e ,  the Minister for '  

 Immigration and Ethnic A f f a i r s ,  Mr Stewart W e s t ,  announced  t o d a y .

 Accommodation and catering services at the C e n t r e , in  N u n a w a d i n g , will close from about the middle of J a n u a r y , 1984.

 The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs intends to  continue to use the Centre for non-residential English classes  and to provide other settlement assistance to refugees and  migrants living in the neighbouring c o m m u n i t i e s .  These will 

 include: .

 . on-arrival and on-going English c l a s s e s ; .  associated child care s e r v i c e s ; .  orientation programs about life in A u s t r a l i a ;   .  information s e r v i c e s ; .  access to settlement support facilities for 

 community g r o u p s .

 Mr West said that there had been a big fall in the number of 

 migrants and refugees seeking accommodation. This followed  the Government's policy of giving priority to family m i g r a t i o n ,   under which sponsors have an obligation to provide a c c o m m o d a t i o n .

 "Despite the closure of a number of centres in Melbourne, Sydney and Wollongong over the past twelve months, there is  still an over-supply of b e d s ,  and it is no longer economical 

 to operate accommodation at E a s t b r i d g e " ,  Mr West said.

 "The closure will permit more economical operation of the  remaining nine centres which are located in all of the State 

 capitals and in Darwin".

 "The number of residents at Eastbridge is already very low.  Housing Advisory O f f i c e r s  employed by the Department of  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will help remaining residents ·   at Eastbridge move to other migrant centres or to private  a c c o m m o d a t i o n " ,  Mr West said.

 A Departmental^social welfare worker has been appointed to  undertake a survey of community needs in the Nunawading area  and to develop programs for meeting these needs. This will  involve close consultations with local authorities,  service 

 providers,  community groups and ethnic organisations.

 Local groups, which have made a major contribution to the resettlement of residents will be invited to continue to offer assistance to newly arrived refugees and migrants who are resettling in the area under family reunion sponsorships.

 Mr West said that the accommodation units at Eastbridge were  a valuable community resource and he hoped that they would not  be left idle.

 There have already been expressions of interest from the  Nunawading City Council and community groups for the use of  the Centre' for housing for low income families. These  suggestions have the support of local State and Federal  Members of Parliament. Applications for the management and 

 use of the facilities will be invited through the Property  Directorate of the Department of Administrative Services  which will liaise closely with the Department of Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs.  ·

 "I am looking for proposals which are compatible with the  use of the Centre as a non-residential community settlement  centre",  Mr West said.

 "However,  the return of the Centre to its primary Commonwealth  use as an accommodation centre for refugees and migrants must  always remain a possibility, should this need arise again".
