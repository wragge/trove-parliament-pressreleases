 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It’s terrific to be here in Auburn this morning. It’s great to be with Bridget, my daughter. It’s great to be with  Craig Laundy, the Coalition’s candidate for Reid. It’s good to be with Connie Fierravanti-Wells who has  been the patron senator here for a long, long time now. Most of all, it’s terrific to be with members of the  Australian community here doing something good for our community. Australians are natural joiners.  Australians are people who naturally have a go. This is a terrific Australian crowd that’s been here today,  fully reflective of the face of modern multicultural Australia.    

 I think it’s really important that the people of Sydney and Australia - but western Sydney in particular this  week - know that there are people in our public life who have a plan for them. The Coalition’s plan for  western Sydney is quite simple: we sort out the transport issue with WestConnex; we sort out the cost of  living issue by abolishing the carbon tax; we try to take some of the pressure off our police with our Safer  Streets, Safer Communities programme that will get CCTV into crime hotspots; and also, particularly today,  we do something about the environment with the Coalition’s Green Army proposal. This is a plan. It’s not  just a visit and I think that’s what the people of western Sydney want. The people of Australia can see what  our positive plans, what our Real Solutions are for this country and that’s what they want. They want to see  hope for the future and that’s what the Coalition is offering them.   

 Before I ask Craig to say a few words and before I ask Bridget to say a few words, I probably should just say  something about Peter Harvey. Peter Harvey was an icon of Australian journalism. He was the genial face of  journalism in this country. He was everything that we like and respect in the media and on behalf of the  Coalition I offer my deepest condolences to his family.   

 Craig, if you’d like to say a few words and then we might ask Bridget to say a few words.

 CRAIG LAUNDY:   

 Thank you, Tony. Thank you, Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells and most importantly thank you very  much to the wonderful array of people that have joined me here today to Clean Up Australia. It is a  wonderful environment, Auburn. It is somewhere that I’ve lived in this area my entire life, like the two  generations of my family before me. It’s always a pleasure to get involved and in the last week to have been  knocking on doors in this area asking people to come down and I think it’s an amazing response to not only  come down and help Clean Up Australia but a great thing to see a man who I’m determined to help make the  next prime minister of Australia. Thank you very much.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Thanks Craig. Bridgey?   

 BRIDGET ABBOTT:   

 I would just like to say that it’s really great to be here to not only help Clean Up Australia and support Dad,  but to really get involved in a community event like this which is really important.   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Thank you. Ok, do we have any questions?   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott you’ve said that you want to help clean up transport in the area and the Coalition would commit  some money to WestConnex, I think it’s only about $1.5 billion out of what is a $10 to $13 billion road  project. Would the State Government need more help if you are actually to get it done?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, the important thing is to get it done and we’ve been talking to Infrastructure Australia and to the State  Government and they believe that a $1.5 billion contribution from the Federal Government is enough to  make this project happen, and it must happen, because we need cranes over our cities, we need bulldozers on  the ground. Few things are more confidence-inspiring than the knowledge that your traffic congestion is  being addressed and I say to the Prime Minister, if she’s fair dinkum about doing the right thing by the  people of western Sydney this week, commit to WestConnex. Maybe it’s too much to expect her at this late  stage to dump the carbon tax; maybe it’s too much to expect her at this late stage to deliver a budget surplus.  But she can commit to WestConnex and that would be a sign that she’s fair dinkum and no one would be  more enthusiastically praising the Prime Minister than myself should she this week take the opportunity to  say: I’ve procrastinated for too long, I’ve neglected this area for too long, I’ve got it wrong in the past, let’s  try to make up for it in the future by committing to WestConnex.   

 QUESTION:   

 You’ve also said you’re going to have...Infrastructure Australia is going to spend about 12 months having a  look at the projects, given your stated commitment to spending money wisely. Will the start of any  infrastructure project, major projects, putting cranes over the city, have to wait until that Infrastructure  Australia review is complete?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 There are some projects that have already had the cost benefit analysis done. There are some projects that  we already know pass the national interest test and this is one that clearly passes the national interest test, as

 does the East West Link in Melbourne, as does the Gateway extension in Brisbane, as does the Pacific  Highway duplication, as does the Bruce Highway improvements, some of which we are already specifically  committed to. But we’ll have more to say about all of these things between now and polling day.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott last week Julia Gillard and her Government promised $50 million to get started on the  Warragamba Dam. It’s actually going to cost about $500 million to get it done. First of all will you match or  honour the commitment Labor’s made? Secondly, will you actually go further and spend more to get the  dam finished?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, what we’re not going to do is engage in gesture politics. I think we’ve seen too much gesture politics  over the last few years where relatively small amounts of money are committed to strike a pose rather than  to make a difference and I want to be part of a government, I want to lead a government, that actually makes  a difference so that after three years of the Coalition people can say; this is what they said they would do,  this is what they’ve actually delivered, this is how things were at the start, this is how things are now. I want  people to see positive change for the better under the Coalition and it’s all here in our Real Solutions plan  and that’s going to be the difference between us and them. If we’re going to make an announcement, we’ll  make sure it’s realistic and we’ll make sure it’s deliverable and we’ll make sure it happens.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, the Prime Minister’s expected to announce a taskforce to tackle gang crime today. Is that  something you’d support?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 It sounds very much like something that the Coalition proposed at the last election. It sounds very much like  the Government is playing catch-up politics here. We’ll have a good look at it. If it makes sense we’ll  support it. But I do have to say that in this, as in all things, you need to look not at what this Government  says but at what it actually does and if you look at what they’ve done, they promised back in 2007 that there  would be 500 additional AFP officers, they’ve failed to deliver on that promise - they’ve actually cut more  than $250 million out of the AFP and as part of those cuts, 97 officers went. If you look at the Australian  Crime Commission, they’ve cut $22 million from that. There are 144 fewer people in the Australian Crime  Commission. If you look at Customs, they’ve cut $60 million out of Customs and that means that less than  10 per cent of incoming air cargos are now screened, whereas under the Howard Government more than 60  per cent of incoming air cargos were screened. That’s why I say if you look at Labor’s ministerial  contribution to western Sydney, you’ve got Chris Bowen who couldn’t stop the boats, you’ve got Jason  Clare who can’t stop the guns and you’ve got David Bradbury who wants to hit every single Australian’s  superannuation nest egg. Now, this is not a party which is doing the right thing by western Sydney   

 QUESTION:   

 The Prime Minister also made some comments about the onus being on Barry O’Farrell to help clean up  corruption in New South Wales politics. What did you make of those?    

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, I think that’s exactly what he’s doing, that’s exactly what he’s doing and obviously these ICAC  hearings are exposing the stinking patronage network which the New South Wales Labor Party has sadly  become.

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott you say the things you promise will be realistic and deliverable. Given - if you win government  at the election this year - you’re likely to face a budget that’s in deficit, do you have to be more realistic  about what is deliverable and cut your cloth to suit? Will you have to actually wind back the things you’ve  promised?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, I am confident that the specific commitments we take to the next election will be deliverable. Now,  obviously any new spending that we commit to is going to have to be accommodated by reductions in  unnecessary spending and what we need to do is spend less money on the things we don’t need so that we  can spend more money on the things we do need. It’s a question of getting your priorities right and I think  Coalition governments have demonstrated that they are capable of doing this. This is what the Howard-Costello Government did and I believe that an Abbott-Hockey government will be able to do much the same  thing.   

 QUESTION:   

 Will it mean more of your promises are in fact aspirational, like your childcare promise, you’re going to put  it to the Productivity Commission but you’re not making specific promises before the election?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 We’ll give people what we believe are realistic timetables. There are some things we will do in year one,  there are other things we will do in year two, there are further things we’ll do in year three and there are  things that we will be doing in years four and five should the public, should the voting public, entrust us  with mandates.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, tomorrow the Fair Work Commission will begin hearing the award wages case for apprentices.  Do you think apprentices earning $317 a week deserve a pay rise?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I never begrudge the hardworking people of Australia a pay rise. All I say is that we’ve got to remember that  it’s got to be affordable. I would like to see Australian workers earn more, I really would, and under the  Howard Government real wages went up by over 20 per cent. The reason why they could sustainably go up  was because productivity increased very substantially in the Howard era. Over the last five years, multi-factor productivity in this country has actually declined - it’s gone down by three per cent - and that’s why  we have trouble sustaining wage rises now.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, Bloomberg New Energy Finance issued a briefing report last week to investors. They rated your  chance of abolishing the carbon tax at only 30 per cent. If you don’t get rid of the carbon tax, will you resign  as prime minister?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, I am going to get rid of the carbon tax.   

 

 5 

 

 QUESTION:   

 But if you don’t, are you going to resign as prime minister?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I just refuse to entertain the thought that an incoming Coalition government will not abolish the carbon tax.   

 QUESTION:   

 But it’s not just up to you, though. You’ll need help in the Senate, either from Labor and they don’t look like  they are going to help you. This is a blood oath. What’s the consequence if you don’t get rid of it?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 We will honour our commitments and our first and principal commitment is to get rid of the carbon tax.  Now, there are provisions in our constitution to resolve a deadlock between the Houses. I don’t expect that  there will be a deadlock between the Houses because I can’t imagine that a Labor Party which loses an  election which is a referendum on the carbon tax will persist. Any persistence by the Labor Party in  supporting a carbon tax would be a defiance of the people and sensible political parties don’t say that they’re  right and the people are wrong.   

 QUESTION:   

 You don’t think Labor will give you a bit of a taste of your own medicine and try and thwart your  government?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 The fact is that where this Government has come up with good policy we’ve supported it. Where they’ve  come up with bad policy we’ve opposed it. That’s what sensible Oppositions do. Now, if this election is won  by the Coalition it will be a clear judgment by the Australian people that they do not want a carbon tax and  why should they want a carbon tax? A carbon tax is bad for our economy, it’s bad for families’ cost of  living, it’s bad for workers’ job security and it doesn’t do anything for the environment. What we’ve got are  strong positive plans to improve our environment. We’ll have an emissions reduction fund which will  involve incentives not penalties for businesses that are doing the right thing. We’ll have our Green Army to  ensure that places like Duck River aren’t just cleaned up once a year but they are permanently cleaned up for  the lasting benefit of Australia, for the lasting benefit of our children and grandchildren.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, what are your thoughts on reports that suggest Australian soldiers were responsible for two  children’s deaths in Afghanistan?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, it is absolutely tragic, absolutely tragic, whenever we get civilian casualties in war. The horrible  feature of war - one of the reasons why we should never lightly wage war - is that almost inevitably awful  mistakes like this happen.

 QUESTION:   

 Andrew Wilkie today will declare that he’s not going to make any deal with either a Liberal or Labor  government to form government in the event of a hung parliament. Is that something that you’d welcome  and is that something you think the other independents should adopt as well?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, this Government has plainly disappointed an enormous number of people. You think back to the  debate at Rooty Hill RSL ten days before polling day, the Prime Minister said failure is not an option. She  made 18 specific promises to people of western Sydney and Australia that night which, I regret to say, she  has not delivered upon. Now, this is why the people of western Sydney and Australia are so disappointed  with this Government and so I can fully understand Andrew Wilkie’s feeling that the last thing he should do  is give the Labor Party a blank cheque.   

 QUESTION:   

 One of those promises you say the Prime Minister has broken was a cut in the company tax but that was  blocked in the Senate in part by the Coalition. How can you say she’s failed when it’s measured that it  couldn’t get through parliament?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 I don’t think Prime Ministers can just say, sorry, it was all too hard. They just can’t do that.   

 QUESTION:   

 But you voted against it, so is that saying you didn’t support it either?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 And she knew, the Government knew going into the election that we didn’t support any spending associated  with the mining tax. So, she knew that we were going to be opposing this because we said we were going to  oppose it. Now, she shouldn’t have made a promise that she couldn’t keep.   

 QUESTION:   

 Mr Abbott, on law and order would you support a proposal that would require people to know if a violent  offender on parole was moving into their neighbourhood?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Look, the point here is that if the Government is going to deal with people whose immigration status is  uncertain, it’s got to know where they are at all times so that if their refugee applications are successful they  can be notified and they can begin a new life in Australia. If their applications are unsuccessful they can be  prepared for return. So, the point is the Government has got to know where people are and at the moment it  seems they don’t.   

 QUESTION:   

 But doesn’t the Government keep a check, doesn’t the Department keep a check on where people are?  They’re required to give their residential address in order to get a bridging visa, they’re required to keep in  contact with the Department and to advise of changes of address?   

 7 

 

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, plainly that is not happening now and I challenge people to ascertain from the Government, did they  know about those asylum seekers who were living in what only could be described as dosshouse in  Parramatta? Now, either they didn’t know or they didn’t care because one way or another that shouldn’t be  happening. I’ll take one more question.   

 QUESTION:   

 Would the suggestions that Scott Morrison made about notifying police about behaviour protocols apply  under your government to those holding temporary protection visas given, as Eric Abetz said, they were  partly aimed at social cohesion?   

 TONY ABBOTT:   

 Well, obviously if you are on a temporary protection visa we expect you to act in accordance with  Australian law. The last thing we want to do is to have people come to this country and break the rules and  typically people who do significantly break the law before they’ve got Australian citizenship aren’t allowed  to stay in Australia, their residency is revoked and I don’t think that’s unusual, I don’t think that’s odd.    

 I think we expect people who come to this country to join our team and to make a contribution. I’ve got to  say as I look around the crowd that I was helping today, these are all terrific Australians who have  enthusiastically become part of the wider Australian community. Migration to Australia has been a  magnificent success story. It has been one of the great features of our country ever since 1788. I think it’s  leant a heroic dimension to our national story. The idea that people can come to Australia from all corners of  the earth, often with nothing except the clothes on their back, and make a terrific life for themselves and  their children; this is what makes us the great country that we are.   

 Thanks so much.
