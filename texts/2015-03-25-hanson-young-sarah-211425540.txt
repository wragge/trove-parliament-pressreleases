 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 25 March 2015   

 Migration bill reduces protection, puts refugees  at risk   

 Genuine refugees will be denied protection and forcefully returned to danger in their home  countries following the passage of the Abbott government's Protection and Other Measures Bill, the  Australian Greens have said.   

 "The Abbott government's obsession with punishing refugees is putting lives at risk," the Greens'  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 "The cheap and nasty politics that has surrounded the passage of this bill has been extremely  disappointing. Fear mongering about false documents and national security has seen the Labor Party  fold and wave this legislation through the Senate.   

 "The fact is, when fleeing from an oppressive regime, refugees often have to use fake documents.  This bill will see those genuine refugees returned to their oppressors."   

 By removing schedule two of the bill, the Australian Greens were able to stop one of the most  dangerous aspects of the legislation from passing.   

 "Increasing the risk threshold required to qualify for 'complimentary protection' would have been  disastrous," Senator Hanson-Young.   

 "Trying to deny protection to women fleeing from honour killings and girls who face female genital  mutilation was a low act, even for this government. Thankfully we were able to stop that from  happening."
