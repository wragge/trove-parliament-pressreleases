  ATTENTION: Political, Environment and Medical Reporters 

  Thousands of Lives at Risk from Climate Change  The risk of death from heat related illnesses and mosquito borne diseases will rise  dramatically for Australians over the next century unless urgent action is taken to address  climate change, the Australian Conservation Foundation has warned. 

  ACF today joined with the Australian Medical Association (AMA) in calling on the federal  Government to lead the w a y  on climate change. The AMA has listed climate change as a  key health issue for the federal election and called on Australia’s political parties to adopt  strong policies to slash greenhouse pollution and get behind renewable energy. 

  “Unless we act today to slash our greenhouse pollution, we are leaving our children an  enormous health threat,” said ACF Executive Director Don Henry. 

  “Stopping climate change is not just about saving the envirorrrnent, it is also about leavlng  our kids with a safe and healthy future. 

  ”More than one thousand people aged over 65 years die each year in 70 major Australian  cities from temperature related stress, B y  2020 annual deaths could number 2,500. By  2050 this number could rise to 6,500. 

  “An estimated 19,000 psople died in the 2003 summer heatwave in Europe. 

  “Malaria, Ross River virus and dengue fever are not established in Australia at present but  they could become so if temperatures begin to rise and tropical regions move South. At  the very least we can expect more frequent and intense outbreaks of these diseases. By  2050 over a million Queenslanders could be at risk from dengue. 

  “Then there is the very real possibility that rising sea levels could see thc forced migration  of many of our Pacific Island neighbours, who would face the health problems that  accompany refugees everywhere - overcrowding, lack of shelter and an increased  vulnerability to disease. 

  ”I congratulate the AMA for taking a strong stand on this serious issue. At present neither  major party has produced a full set of policies to adequately tackle climate change. We  need national leadership right now if we are to avoid climate change’s worst effects on  national icons like Kakadu. the Great Barrier Reef and the Daintree - and on human  health. 

  “ACF is pleased to be joined by the Australian Medical Association in calling on the major  parties to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, to dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions and  encourage the growth of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power by setting a  Mandatory Renewable Energy Target of 10% by 2010. 

  “These measures are essential if Australia is to reach thc vital target of reducing  greenhouse emissions by at least 60% by 2050.”
