 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  Senate Courtyard, Parliament House, CANBERRA  1:15PM WEDNESDAY    

 18 OCTOBER 2006  __________________________________________________________________ 

 ISSUES: Failings in refugee settlement services from the Howard Government  __________________________________________________________________ 

 

 Annette Hurley:  The Howard government’s latest consultation paper is an  admission of failure on refugee settlement policy. This new paper proposes that there  be another layer of service provision on top of the settlement services already  provided.    

 Now it was only last year, in October last year, that the Government unveiled its new  refugee resettlement programme. It’s a $50 million programme which is meant to  address the issues of early settlement of refugees. It was met with a welter of  criticism and huge problems, but rather than fixing the problems of its programme, 

 the Government has decided to chuck another bucket of money in providing a new  service and this is what the consultation paper is all about.   

 Now I think that early settlement is just so important in determining whether refugees  can integrate into Australian society that we really can’t leave it to this incompetent  administration to do it.
