 JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

 MEDIA RELEASE

 “PACIFIC SOLUTION” AN ILLUSION NOT A SOLUTION

 In  the  May  Budget  Papers  the  Government  claimed  that  no  new  asylum  seeker  would  be processed on Australian soil and it budgeted $430 million over four years for the processing of asylum seekers in third countries like Papua New Guinea and Nauru.

 Following yesterday’s  statement  by the President  of  Nauru,  Rene Harris,  it  is  now  clear the Howard  Government  is  botching  its  current  short-term  arrangement  with  Nauru.   If  the Howard Government is incapable of maintaining this short-term arrangement why should any one believe that the Howard Government can maintain the arrangement for four years.

 The Howard Government needs to answer the following questions today:

  ! Has the Howard Government entered any four year arrangements with third countries to process asylum seekers?  Clearly, it doesn’t have one with Nauru. ! Has  the  Howard  Government  even  bothered  to  tell  President  Harris  that  it  wants  a four-year agreement? ! Does the Howard Government believe Nauru will enter such an arrangement in view

  of its current bungling?

  If  the  Government  can’t  point  to  a  four-year arrangement  or  a  realistic  prospect  of  entering one, then it should concede that the “Pacific Solution” will come to end this year and it cannot be  the  long-term  solution.   The  Government  should  concede  that  the  Budget  papers  are nothing more than a work of fiction, a series of lies in a glossy cover.

  Rather  than  propping  up  the  illusion  of  a  long  term  “Pacific  Solution”  by  further  excisions and  other  stop-gap  measures,  the  Government  should  admit  the  truth  and  start  work  on  a comprehensive long term plan to deal with refugee and asylum seeker issues.

  If  the  Government  prefers  to  ignore  the  national  interest  by  pretending  that  a  long-term “Pacific  Solution”  is  anything  more  than  a  illusion,  then  Labor  will  do  the  Government’s work  for  it  and  develop  a  comprehensive  long  term  plan  that  is  both  tough  on  border protection and compassionate.
