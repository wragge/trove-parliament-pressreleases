 ANOTHER BOAT ARRIVAL, ANOTHER BROKEN PROMISE BY LABOR 

 Mr Scott Morrison MP  

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 

 Mr Michael Keenan MP  

 Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and 

 Border Protection, Michael Keenan said the interception of another boat carrying 41 passengers and four crew by 

 HMAS Ararat this evening, is evidence of a further broken promise by Labor.  

 Mr Morrison and Mr Keenan said: “Only last Saturday we joined Tony Abbott in Darwin to go on board HMAS 

 Ararat and meet the crew and talk about the important job they do for Australia. Only a few days later they have 

 been back at sea ferrying more passengers to Christmas Island.  

 “Thirteen boats have now arrived this year carrying more than 700 passengers in just seven weeks.  

 “Labor promised to maintain a strong border protection regime, with Mr Rudd even claiming they would turn back 

 the boats.  

 “As each boat arrives, it is abundantly clear that this is just another broken promise by Labor.”  

 Mr Keenan said: “This latest arrival is evidence that Minister O’Connor has now joined the growing queue of 

 Rudd's bungling ministers.  

 "Minister O’Connor has overseen the complete collapse of Australia’s border protection and should be held 

 accountable for putting our borders at risk.  

 "The Prime Minister needs to answer for the abysmal state of Australia's border protection, and the incompetency 

 of his minister,” he said.  

 Mr Morrison said: “Like on so many issues, Labor blames international factors for their failures, but they can’t spin 

 the boats away.  

 “The only thing that has really changed is that under Labor, Australia has become a soft touch for people 

 smugglers and there is now a highway on the sea to Christmas Island.  

 “Earlier this week it was revealed that UNHCR figures showed that Australia’s increase in asylum applications in 

 the nine months to September 2009 had increased more than five times the global average,” he said.
