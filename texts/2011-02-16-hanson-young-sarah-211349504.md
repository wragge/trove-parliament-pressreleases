 Time To Turn New Page In Asylum Seeker Debate  

 Political leaders have a responsibility to turn a new page in the asylum seeker  debate, following an unedifying day in Australian politics where Opposition Leader  Tony Abbott and Shadow Immigration Minister Scott Morrison sparked a cost-row  over funerals for the Christmas Island Boat Tragedy, said Greens Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young.  

 “While friends and families were grieving for their loved ones, these senior Liberals  were trying to put a price tag on their grief. This took political debate in our country to  a new low,” said the Greens Immigration Spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.  

 “While today Mr Morrison says he got the timing wrong, both he and his Leader fail  to recognise that there is in fact, no time and place to play cheap politics with the  lives of vulnerable people.”  

 “After yesterday’s low point, it is time for all political leaders in this country to draw a  line in the sand.  

 Rather than debating the cost of compassion, we should be looking at the price to  our nation if we don’t have it.” 

 “With more than 1000 children in immigration detention and with mental health  issues systemic in these facilities, it’s time for all sides to look at how we can better  protect the welfare of innocent children.”  

 Senator Hanson-Young said the Minister’s decision to send a young Iranian boy who  lost both his parents in the boat tragedy back to detention on Christmas Island, is  further evidence that the current immigration system is failing children.  

 “As signatories to both the Refugee Convention and the Convention on the Rights of  the Child, Australia has a responsibility to ensure that the best interests of the child  are paramount. This is particularly true when dealing with asylum seekers. Sadly  politics is getting in the way of doing what is best for these vulnerable children,”  Senator Hanson-Young said.
