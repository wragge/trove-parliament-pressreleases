 Morrison  

 With Martin Zaiter our wonderful Liberal candidate here for Parramatta with my good  friend and college Alex Hawke and Dr Yadu Singh here, to be here with the India  Australia association and soon to be celebrating Indian independence day but in  particular to be part of this incredible festival that has built up year on year on year  which celebrates Indian national heritage here within Australia but in particular,  importantly raising much needed funds for the victims of those terrible floods in India  just over a month ago with thousands upon thousands of victims the Indian  community are an extremely generous community we've seen that here in our own  country over many, many years but we've also seen this community here also  support their, those of Indian heritage and others back in their home country as well,  so this is a very exciting day to be here supporting them but particularly today I  wanted to alert you to something I think quite significant and quite serious. 

 Today on the website what you will find is a series of letters that have been  presented to the Australian public and made public which demonstrate very, very  clearly that what the government is doing by continuing to run taxpayer funded ads  to promote their unravelling boat policy is being done at the instruction of political  masters not on the advice of government departments, what we have here is a  government that is using your money to try and sell their political message in the  middle of an election campaign now I'll leave the debate to lawyers about caretaker  conventions but what I know is this, this arrangement just doesn’t pass the fair 

 dinkum test, Kevin Rudd using your money to sell his political message  in the  middle of an election campaign.  

 The letters go through quite clearly that the department of Immigration and  Citizenship is being instructed by Minister Burke and the AG to go out there and  keep spending taxpayers money to fund the political messaging of this Government  in election campaign. it doesn’t say here that the department has advised it or  recommended, they're just doing what they've been told to do by the political  interests of the Labor Government so Australians I think know they can see through  something that is not fair dinkum and what they can see is this just is not fair dinkum  whether they're putting adds, and if you’ve got the paper, I mean full page ads in  papers like this being funded by the taxpayer to promote the governments political  interests is not in the spirit of the caretaker conventions and it’s not in the spirit of  frankly being fair dinkum with the Australian people. 

 These ads are about trying to talk to vote people not boat people and the  Government I think has been exposed here by the release of these letters by the  public servants which show that they're being told to do it, it wasn’t their advice to do  it they've been told to do it and they're just having to do what their government  masters are telling them to do in the middle of an election campaign, now this is  straight out of the NSW Labor textbook this is the anything that it takes and  everything that it takes mentality that made Eddie Obeid famous and that’s what  we’re seeing here from this government in the middle of this election campaign, now  if you're opposed to that, which I’m sure there are thousands if not millions of  Australians you are then I suggest you go to Stoptheads.com.au and register your  disgust with this Government about using your money, your money to promote their  own political interests in the middle of an election campaign and I encourage you to  do that as thousands already have and encourage others to register their absolute  disgust with the lengths that this government will go to prop up their flailing  campaign. 

 Reporter: is there anything you can actually do about what they have done now at  the moment with the advertising? 

 Morrison: 

 Well I think what we have to do about this is expose it, and these letters expose the  government’s dishonesty in trying to pass this off as something in the country’s  interest, this is about Kevin Rudd's political interests to prop up his flailing campaign  using taxpayer’s money and he had to force the public servants to do it, they had to  take the extraordinary action to sign letters of direction both from the AG and the  Minister for Immigration forcing the public servants to spend your money to promote  the Government's political interests 

 Reporter [inaudible] didn’t the Howard government [inaudible] [do something  similar?] 

 Morrison: 

 No they didn’t, no they didn’t, those adds were actually authorised by the Australian  Federal Police not the Australian Government, the Australian Federal Police  authorised those ads and modifications were made to them based on discussions  with the Opposition at the time, the Opposition here is totally opposed to those full  page ads and TV advertisements and everything running during the election  campaign they can run them off shore, but trying to tell people sitting in Bondi  reading the SMH on a Saturday morning, that would otherwise be going for a surf  today that they shouldn’t become a people smuggler is exactly what it looks like,  this  is just a government’s flailing campaign trying to be propped up using taxpayer funds  and its simply just outrageous. 

 Reporter: Do you agree with Kevin Rudd assertion that ... is the underdog in  [inaudible] debate tonight. 

 Morrison:  

 We’ll let others commentate on the political fortunes but what I do know is this,  Labor’s campaign is just going from stumble to stumble, I mean they’ve had to sack  more candidates just over the last couple of days and Kevin Rudd’s campaign is just  unravelling I mean the Labor Party hailed him as a messiah but to quote Monty  python which his campaign is resembling it seems like he’s just been a very naughty  boy. 

 Reporter: in government will you consider maybe appointing an independent arbiter  or ombudsman or something like that to look at advertising in the caretaker period 

 Morrison: 

 Well look I’ll leave those sort of issues to the Auditor General and of course the  Attorney General if we were elected to government but I think what we need to do  here is call this out I mean what the Government has done here just doesn’t pass the  fair dinkum test and think that’s what Australians are finding with Kevin Rudd as  every day passes they are remembering that Kevin Rudd is just not fair dinkum and  this attempt to try and pass off government advertising as something that is needed  at this time and it’s just political advertising I think just demonstrates that in spades,  these guys just aren’t fair dinkum. 

 Reporter: [inaudible] do you know what the size of the Australian Indian population is  and why it is so necessary to get that vote [inaudible] 

 Morrison:  

 Well the Indian diaspora here in Australia is one that can hold its head very high they  have a wonderful entrepreneurial spirit they have a passion for democracy and  citizenship here in this country and India is now people of Indian citizenship and 

 nationality are our single largest intake of migrants to Australia and even more  importantly than that they are the single biggest contributor to things like skilled  migration under the general purpose scheme,  general skilled migration they're also  the single largest contributor coming to Australia with 457's and I know that the  Indian community would be outraged at the sort of rhetoric that was being levelled  against people on 457's by this government over the last 6 months, I mean Indian  citizens account for 1 in 5 457's issues they have a 20% growth rate in 457's so the  governments attack on people with 457's and skilled migration I'm not surprised has  caused great offense in the Indian community but I'm very proud to be here with  Martin and Alex as we've been here in years previous to celebrate the contribution to  Australia of people of  Indian nationality originally. 

 Reporter: [inaudible] how big the population Indian population was in Australia ? 

 Morrison: yeah it’s around seven hundred thousand yeah. 

 Reporter: another thing just it was revealed that the how many boats did you actually  turn back when you were in government? 

 Morrison: 

 That’s been on the record for ages I mean there ....clearly four that definitely were  and as Admiral Ritchie made very clear the fact that they were being turned back is  the reason that they stopped coming,  that’s why they stopped coming because they  were confronted by a Government that was fair dinkum about border protection, I  mean John Howard didn’t stop the boats with ads, John Howard didn’t try and spin  the boats away like Kevin Rudd is trying to do before an election he had policies that  were implemented and that’s why the Australian people trust the Coalition to get this  job done on the other side of the election. The Coalition has the proven record the  proven policies and the proven resolve and that’s why need people like Martin here  in Parramatta to be part of that Abbott team that will get this job done, because on  the Labor side they have had every point on the compass on this issue, and that’s  why they can’t be trusted on the other side of an election to follow through, because  we always know on the other side it unravels 

 Reporter: what’s your take on the success rate of asylum seekers in the refugee  assessment process, do you think that’s too high and will that form part of [inaudible] 

 Morrison: 

 I’ve said many times that Labor’s been running a tick and flick approach when it  comes to these assessments I mean the fact that they are giving the benefit of the  doubt to people who are known to have thrown their documents away,  goes  completely against the policy proposals of the Coalition. We will use the existing  powers in the Act those who are found to be [inaudible] their documents away and  we form that view reasonably they won’t get refugee status, they won’t get a yes,  and that’s been our policy, Labor what’s to put them to the back of the queue, the 

 coalition won’t put them in the queue at all. .....Ok [inaudible] well thanks for the  opportunity to be here, Dr Singh .......Martin Zaiter (interview) 

 Morrison: 

 Well it’s great to be here with him (Dr Singh) as well and we really appreciate his  invitation to be here and be part of this wonderful celebration, I mean what you won’t  hear a Coalition Government say to Australia’s migrant communities as the Labor  party has said over the last six months, the Labor Party have told the Australian  community that migrants take people’s jobs, in Australia, you won’t hear that from  the Coalition, you never have, you never will and the fact that the Government has  resorted to that sort of rhetoric over the last six months in their attacks on skilled  migration I think are, is a statement of absolute policy poverty on behalf of the Labor  Party, and what we're offering here is real, hope, real reward and real opportunity  because that’s what the migrant communities of Australia have demonstrated over  generations and that’s what we're celebrating here with the Indian community today,  thanks.
