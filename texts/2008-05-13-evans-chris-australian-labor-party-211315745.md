 Budget 2008-09 - Commitment to improve detention 

 Tuesday, 13 May 2008 

 The Rudd Government will deliver on its commitment to redevelop Villawood  Immigration Detention Centre, as part of an overall promise to improve  immigration detention accommodation. 

 The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, said today  a $1.1 million feasibility study for the redevelopment of the Villawood centre  will be conducted in 2008-09. 

 The redevelopment study will follow the completion in 2007-08 of capital  works on the new Christmas Island detention centre and immigration transit  accommodation in Brisbane and Melbourne. 

 ‘Villawood was originally constructed as an immigration hostel in 1949 and the  aged infrastructure does not provide appropriate amenity for people in  detention or for visitors and staff,’ Senator Evans said. 

 While the facility on Christmas Island will be the main centre for processing  future unauthorised boat arrivals now that the Nauru and Manus Island  centres have closed, Villawood is the primary onshore detention facility. 

 The Budget also provides for a $5.6 million, 12-month extension to the Case  Management and Community Care Pilot program which provides targeted  assistance to people while their immigration status is resolved. 

 The program provides practical support for health and welfare needs, offers  immigration information and counselling on options for return to home country  and also provides independent migration advice. 

 This assistance also includes provision of short-term accommodation, basic  living allowance payments and coordinating medical health checks. 

 ‘With funding arrangements through organisations such as the International  Organization for Migration, the Australian Red Cross and Immigration Advice  and Application Assistance Scheme providers this program has demonstrated  that early intervention, together with targeted assistance, is critical in  achieving better immigration outcomes,’ Senator Evans said. 

 These measures should be seen as a key component in the Rudd  Government’s commitment to return integrity to the Australia’s migration  system.
