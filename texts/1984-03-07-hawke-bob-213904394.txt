 It .is a matter of great regret to me that I am unable to bo  present at the Annual Meeting of the Parliamentary Group of  Amnesty into mat Iona! tonight.  The work of the group is of  utmost .importance in reinforcing Amnesty International 's efforts  to strengthen the expression of Australians' public concern on  human rights issues as a whole,  and especially for the  continued detention of thousands of prisoners of conscience  held in prisons throughout the world.

 The Government attaches a strong priority to human rights  issues.  We cooperate closely with Amnesty International and  greatly appreciate its information-gathering work.  We  naturally wish that any approaches on human rights cases are as  effective as possible,  and I have to say that there are 

 situations where the efforts of non-government organisations can  be more effective than the efforts of governments.

 The Government has pursued a number of cases of political  prisoners and has supported relevant United Nations initiatives  on human rights. We have expressed concern about human rights  violations to a variety of governments of different 

 ideological persuasions and in different areas of the world,   whose relations with Australia are of differing degrees of  closeness. We have had a number of successes,  the most  recent of which was the release of 3 detainees in South  Korea following my visit.

 While not a matter of direct concern to Amnesty International  under its terms of reference, I would like to raise a related  matter which is also of serious concern to the Government and to  the Australian community as a whole. I refer to the forced and 

 tragic separation of families as a result of the actions of  Government authorities which refuse to expedite or allow exit  arrangements for the families of their nationals who have already  left their countries of origin and sought asylum, refugee status, 

 residence or citizenship in Australia.  There is, for example, a  fairly constant caseload of over 300 family units from Eastern  Europe alone who seek to be reunited in Australia.  The  Government does all it can to keep these cases before the 

 authorities concerned, and in whose hands the resolution of this  problem ultimately rests. I would like to take this opportunity  to enlist your concern and to call for these authorities to show 

 compassion for these families and to allow them to be reunited  in Australia.  · .

 Last October I participated in a ceremony to light a candle of hope  to commemorate Prisoner of Conscience Week. These symbolic  occasions serve the useful purpose of drawing international  attention to the importance of observing human rights,  whether in  the field of political freedoms, racism, sexism or legal protection  We must all maintain our vigilance or) these issues through the 

 entire year.

 I wish the Parliamentary Group of Amnesty International well in  its deliberations.

 R.J.L. Hawke
