 Sen Bob Brown   

 

 Press Release   

 Friday, 7 November 2003   

 

 Government and Labor Combine to Keep  Migration Regulations   

 

 The Government and the Labor party have combined to defeat an attempt by  Greens Senator Bob Brown to disallow the government's migration regulations  that excise 4000 islands from Australia's migration zone - including all the islands  down the Queensland coast to Mackay.   

 "By allowing these regulations to stand until the end of November the  Government is given maximum flexibility to make sure the 14 asylum seekers are  imprisoned on Christmas island - permanently outside Australia's migration  zone," Senator Brown said. 

 

 

 "The Kurds are an oppressed minority. On repeated occasions the Prime Minister  has highlighted Sadam Hussein's brutality towards them. Whether in Turkey or  Iraq o Kurdish people face terrible persecution. 

 

 

 "Australia has a big enough heart to give these 14 people access to the courts to  put their case. Both the Government and Opposition have closed that door for  the next 2 weeks.   

 

 "No part of Australia should be outside the migration zone. The Greens will  continue to press both the ALP and the Government to change their policies and  put Christmas Island and Ashmore reef back in Australia," Senator Brown said.
