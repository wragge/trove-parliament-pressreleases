  LARGEST REMOVAL TO TURKEY OF ILLEGAL ENTRANTS

  

  

  Thirty-four Turkish boat people who arrived in Australia earlier this 
year were returned home on Sa turday 31 July, in what represents 
the largest removal to Turkey Australia has ever conducted, the Minister 
for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today.

  

 Mr Ruddock said that in the past, Australia had only 
ever returned two or three Turks at a time. In removing such a large 
group, he said he hoped it would show others that any attempt to enter 
Australia illegally was not only dangerous, but futile.

  

 “The 34 Turkish men returned home were all part 
of people smuggling rackets,” said the Minister. “They paid organisers 
up to US$8000 each to travel to Indonesia and board fishing vessels 
bound for Ashmore Reef.

  

 “The futility of such journeys was also highlighted 
recently with the tragic drowning of 15 people off Christmas Island, 
believed to be Sri Lankans, late last month.

  

 “A press statement has been released in Turkey announcing 
the return of the 34 men. The statement clearly spells out to potential 
passengers that people who try to enter Australia illegally will be 
detained, and that if they have no right to stay, will be sent back 
to their homeland.”

  

 Mr Ruddock added that people smugglers can now be 
fined up to $220,000 and receive prison sentences up to 10 years, or 
20 years where more than 5 people are involved. These increased penalties 
also act as a strong warning that Australia is intent on ending rackets 
that traffic in human cargo.

  

 In addition, the Minister said his Department was 
also introducing recommendations recently made by the Prime Ministers 
Coastal Surveillance Task Force. He said these included boosting the 
Department’s presence at seven overseas posts and five key airports, 
as well as working closely with countries such as Indonesia and Papua 
New Guinea, to help them detect and detain traffickers.
