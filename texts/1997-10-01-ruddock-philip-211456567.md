  Funding boost for NT settlement services  "The Government has demonstrated its commitment to regional Australia with community grants  commencing today to organisations which serve regional , rural and remote communities" the Minister  for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today. 

  The successful Northern Territory organisations who help migrants and humanitarian entrants to  settle in Australia , were announced by the Minister on 28 August as a $197 045 package of awards  under the Community Settlement Services (CSS) Scheme and the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement  Strategy . 

  Mr Ruddock said four community organisations in the Northern Territory had received six awards  between them, including the St Vincent de Paul Society in Darwin and the Migrant Resource Centre  of Central Australia in Alice Springs. 

  "These funds will help both organisations to upgrade their computer equipment which will be used to  facilitate the provision of settlement-related information," Mr Ruddock said. 

  Other organisations to receive funds were the Ethnic Communities Council of NT and the Torture and  Trauma Survivors Service of NT. 

  "The funding is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to helping migrants and refugees  settle quickly into their new community, including people outside the major metropolitan areas," said  MrRuddock. 

  "The new grant arrangements focus on meeting community needs while at the same time ensuring the  Government and community receive value for money . 

  "This package of funding refle cts the Government's commitment to providing services wh ich help  migrants and humanitarian entrants settle in their new country and quickly become contributing  m embers of our community."
