  AUSTRALIA 
COMMITS $1.5 MILLION TO DEMINING IN AFRICA

  

  I am pleased to announce tha  t the Australian Government has decided to provide 
$1.5 million towards de-mining activities in Africa.

  

  Australia will contribute $1 million over three years 
to the United Nations Development Programmes' Accelerated Demining Programme 
in Mozambique. As well, the Australian aid organisation, AUSTCARE, will 
receive nearly $500,000 which it will use to expand its demining activities 
in Angola during the next 12 months.

  

  The UNDP programme will help save the lives and limbs 
of subsistence farmers in Mozambique. This project will also make a 
tangible contribution to sustainable development and poverty reduction 
in one of the world's poorest countries.

  

  The use of land mines was widespread during the protracted 
Mozambique civil war that ended with the signing of the Rome Peace Treaty 
in 1992. The war was fought mainly in rural areas, where unexploded 
land mines now pose a serious threat to farmers, lock up productive 
land, and impair other development.

  

  The programme will involve clearing mine fields in 
the province of Inhambane, releasing arable land for cultivation. In 
turn, the province will be able to provide work and food for an increased 
number of people, reducing migration to the cities and boosting Mozambique's 
exports.

  

  The number of landmines laid in Angola is estimated 
at between 10 and 14 million following 30 years of conflict. It is a 
sad fact that there are approximately 70,000 Angolan amputees as a result 
of landmines, with children under 15 comprising the largest group now 
most at risk.

  

  Further, there are still more than one million people 
internally displaced there, plus more than 100,000 Angolan refugees 
in neighbouring countries who cannot return home until the treacherous 
landmines are located and removed.

  

  The AUSTCARE project will use highly trained dogs 
to clear landmines laid along several thousand kilometres of roads. 
This latest contribution brings Australian Government funding for demining 
activities in Angola in 1997 and 1998 to more than $1 million.

  

  As Australia's newly-appointed Special Representative 
on Demining, I look forward to ensuring that the delivery of this vital 
aspect of the Howard Government's aid programme is world class.
