 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship    Joint  Media Release  with Michael Keenan    

 Sunday 16 May 2010    

 CHRISTMAS ISLAND BACK TO BRINK WITH ARRIVAL OF  BOAT K126    

 The illegal arrival of boat K126 will take Christmas Island back to the brink, forcing more  detainees to be transferred to the mainland, Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border  Protection, Michael Keenan said today.    

 “The 126th boat to arrive since Kevin Rudd rolled back the Coalition's strong border  protection regime, was carrying 92 people. It was the 20th boat to arrive since the  Government announced their asylum freeze, just five weeks ago,” Mr Morrison said.    

 “The fact that yet again a vessel was intercepted in distress highlights the risks that are  being taken,” he said.    

 “The capacity at Christmas Island was recently increased by another 400 beds to cater  for 2,500 detainees. When this latest boat arrives, there will be more than 2,450 people  on Christmas Island, unless more detainees are transferred to other centres or hotels on  the mainland.    

 “It is worth remembering that when the Rudd Government was elected, Christmas Island  had a standard capacity of 400 people and there were just two detainees on the Island.    

 “With the arrival of this latest boat there will be in excess of 3,500 people in some form of  immigration detention around Australia, including Christmas Island. This is an increase  of more than 1,500 since January, including those whose claims have been rejected yet  are still here, going through their appeals.     

 “The rapid escalation in the detention population has created a billion dollar budget  blowout for costs on Christmas Island and to increase the capacity of on shore detention  facilities, including the reopening of Curtin. Yet the Rudd Government has still not  budgeted for either the increase in costs to run their expanded onshore detention  centres, nor the increase in the onshore detention population,” Mr Morrison said.    

 Mr Keenan said: “This latest arrival will remove two navy patrol vessels and one customs  vessel from their regular duties, leaving a gaping hole in our border protection system.    

 "Thanks to budget and staffing cuts in last week's budget on top of a broken border  protection policy, the Customs and Border Protection Service is already  stretched beyond its limit without having to deal with regular arrivals of boats of nearly  100 passengers on board.    

 "As long as Rudd Labor remains in Government, Australia will continue to be a magnet  for people smugglers.    

 "This Government is all talk and no action when it comes to securing Australia's  borders,” Mr Keenan said.
