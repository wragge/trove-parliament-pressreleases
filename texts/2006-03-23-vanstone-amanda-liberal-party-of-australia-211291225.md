  DECISION ON INDONESIAN ARRIVALS 

  The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has granted temporary visas to 42  Indonesians from Papua province in Indonesia who arrived in Australia in January, the  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, announced  today. 

  “Decisions on visa claims are made by individual decision-makers in my department, in  accordance with international legal obligations and Australian domestic law and on the  basis of claims made by individual applicants,” the Minister said. 

  “The 42 claimants have been granted Temporary Protection Visas (TPV) and will be  relocated to Melbourne. 

  “They will have access to the same services as other TPV holders. 

  “These people have completed their medical and character checks and will be moved into  the community.” 

  A decision is yet to be made on a visa application from the remaining member of the  group, as there are further case-specific issues to be pursued. 

  The 43 occupants of an outrigger canoe were located on the Cape York Peninsula, near  Weipa, on 18 January, 2006. 

  They were transferred to the Christmas Island Immigration Reception and Processing  Centre for the interview and visa application process, in line with long-standing  government policy for unauthorised boat arrivals.
