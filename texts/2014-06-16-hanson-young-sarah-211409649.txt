 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Monday, 16 June 2014    

 Australian Greens back calls to process asylum seekers in Tasmania. 

 

 The Australian Greens are today backing calls from the community to process asylum seekers in  Tasmania instead of Manus Island and Nauru.   

 “This is a viable, humane option that the Abbott Government seriously needs to consider,” the  Greens' Immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Instead of spending billions of dollars sending asylum seekers to the camps of cruelty on Manus  Island and Nauru, we should be processing them onshore where we know they are safe.”   

 “This would also allow the Government to put their proposed $8.3 billion for immigration detention  towards injecting funds into the Tasmanian economy instead.”   

 “Our Government needs to stop this ‘out of sight, out of mind’ attitude and honour their obligations  to process asylum seekers fairly and efficiently in Australia.”   

 “Our Government cannot guarantee the safety of asylum seekers offshore, no matter how much  money they throw at the problem.”   

 “It’s time for a new and more humane approach, and this is the first rational one we’ve heard in  months.”
