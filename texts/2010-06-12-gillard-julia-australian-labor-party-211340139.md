 Doorstop - University of Queensland  

 

 

 1000AM SATURDAY  12 JUNE 2010  UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND 

 ISSUES:  Education Investment Fund; Comments in today’s Australian newspaper;  Asylum seekers; leadership 

 JULIA GILLARD: It’s great to be here today at the University of Queensland with our  candidate for Ryan, Steven Miles. 

 Our Education Revolution is making reforms to improve education all the way through from  the earliest years of child care before school, through to our great universities and, step by  step, we’ve been delivering that change, including transformational change for Australia’s  universities - implementing the Bradley Review, which means universities can now chart  their own course and choose to grow. And as a result of those changes, there are 44,000 extra  Australians having the opportunity to go to university this year and, encouragingly, more of  those students are coming from low SES backgrounds; that is, we are giving people a fairer  go to get into universities. 

 In addition, we’ve wanted to make sure our universities have got the capital infrastructure  they need for the 21st century. As a result of continuing to strengthen our economy, we are  able to continue to invest in capital in our universities. So today, I’m here to announce two  very special projects here in Queensland will be funded by our Education Investment Fund.  

 Where we stand today, at the University of Queensland, we will be making funds available to  support the development of a new centre for advanced imaging. We’ve obviously had the  ability today to see the current imaging technology and facilities both for humans and for  animals. These facilities are used to assist with research all the way through from looking at  animals into humans, into driving changes in clinical practice, which make a difference for all  Australians. The benefit of this new facility will be the creation of a new building, as well as  new imaging technology of even greater calibre than the technology we’ve seen today. 

 Second, and also importantly, we will be supporting a six green star-rated teaching and  research facility at Griffith University’s Nathan Campus. An emphasis of our Education  Investment Funds projects has been on sustainability. Obviously, by definition, our  universities are home to some of our best and brightest Australians and we are working with  those best and brightest Australians to tackle the various challenges of climate change,  including in how the universities run themselves and the work that they do. So this new 

 investment at Griffith University will enable it to have a six green star-rated building in  which to undertake teaching and research.  

 This I think is good news, good news for Queensland, good news for these two universities,  but investing in universities is important to the nation overall. The statistics and research is  absolutely clear. If we want to have a stronger economy in a competitive world, then the  institutional strength of our universities is vital to strengthening that economy. So  investments in universities actually touch the lives of all Australians and we’re announcing  two very important investments today.  

 So with those words, I’m very happy to take any questions and thank you very much for  showing us around. 

 JOURNALIST: Today Keith De Lacy has called for Kevin Rudd to be dumped if Labor  wants to win at the next election. What do you think of that? 

 JULIA GILLARD: Look I’ve read this morning’s newspapers and, as usual when you read  your newspapers, you see people with a variety of perspectives and views. Obviously one  perspective has been expressed today by Mr De Lacy. The focus that we’ve got isn’t on what  may be in the daily newspapers. Our focus is on continuing to strengthen our economy so that  we can deliver a fair share to working families. 

 What matters to me is the numbers of Australians who are benefiting from things like the tax  cuts we’re providing, the special measures we’re taking to assist with the costs of education  and the costs of child care. What matters to us is a strong economy, giving Australians the  ability to get jobs as well as making sure that the education system and the health system is  there providing quality services for them. 

 JOURNALIST: Keith De Lacy worked closely with Kevin Rudd in the Goss Government.  Doesn’t that make his comments all that more pertinent? 

 JULIA GILLARD: Individuals looking at politics will come to a variety of views. That’s  the great nature, essential nature of our democracy and people will express those different  views. You’re asking me for my reaction and my reaction is I read the newspapers and then I  put the newspapers aside and I get on with the job of delivering what we’ve promised the  Australian people which is a strengthening economy, delivering a fair share for working  families.  

 That’s what we were elected to do with our ambitious agenda and of course we’ve set about  delivering that agenda step by step. Not everything’s gone according to plan but we’ve made  real progress and we’re here today making further real progress in our Education Revolution. 

 JOURNALIST: But what do you think of the substance of Mr De Lacy’s argument? 

 JULIA GILLARD: Well I think you can assess, from what I’ve just said, obviously, I don’t  agree with the view that’s been expressed by Mr De Lacy and I’ve read the newspapers and  the thing that matters is not what’s in the pages of the daily newspapers but focused on  making a difference to working families. 

 JOURNALIST: Even Kevin Rudd’s brother is critical of him, saying he’s starting his own  little spot fires. 

 JULIA GILLARD: Well, I think, actually that’s a little bit of a stretch on Mr Greg Rudd’s  contribution to today’s newspapers but, once again, the essence of democracy, the essence I  suspect of putting together entertaining Saturday newspapers is that you pull a variety of  views from a variety of sources and publish them. That’s all to the good, people like to read  their Saturday newspapers. 

 But from the point of view of the Government, what we are focused on is the issues that are  mattering today to working families - getting a job -nothing more important to a family than  making sure people have got the benefit of work. And, of course, a big focus of our  Government was doing what needed to be done in the face of the global financial crisis to  keep Australians in work and this week, as recently as Thursday, we saw the 5.2 per cent  unemployment rate falling from 5.4. We compare that with nations around the world where  literally millions of working people lost their jobs as a result of the global financial crisis. 

 So, working to strengthen our economy to deliver jobs and obviously, working to deliver  important reforms like our Education Revolution. 

 JOURNALIST: But shouldn’t alarm bells be ringing when people like Keith De Lacy,  who’s a Labor man from the past, I mean, shouldn’t that be ringing alarm bells that you’re on  the wrong path when people like that are critical of your policy? 

 JULIA GILLARD: The thing that we consider when we make decisions is what’s in the  national interest, what’s in the national interest to strengthen the economy, how can we make  the economy stronger and what can we do to deliver working Australians a fairer share.  They’re the guiding principles of the Rudd Government and that’s how we assess each and  every decision. 

 JOURNALIST: If the Prime Minister’s own family is not convinced that Australia’s a better  country than it was three years ago, why should other ordinary Australians be convinced? 

 JULIA GILLARD: Well, once again, I think that may be putting a greater construction on  Mr Greg Rudd’s words than they actually bear, but what I’m clearly saying to you is we will  have an election obviously during the course of this year and Australians themselves will  decide who they want to govern the country. And in that election we will be saying to  Australians as I’m saying today: we were elected with an ambitious agenda. We’re making  real progress.  

 Faced with the global financial crisis, we did what had to be done to keep Australians in  work. And if we look at the things we’ve achieved—ending Work Choices - very important  to working families; investing in local schools; national curriculum; the My School website;  all of our reforms for school education - and here we are today talking about investments in  the pathways that young people have after school and we’ve also been investing in vocational  education and training.  

 These are the things that matter to working families along with our real investments in health,  including more doctors and more nurses. 

 JOURNALIST: Just on the asylum issue with the people smugglers, how likely is it that  Dalby will be selected as the location to house them? 

 JULIA GILLARD: On that question, thank you for that question, the Department of  Immigration routinely makes preliminary inquiries of this nature and as I’m advised the  inquiry at Dalby has been one of those preliminary inquiries. No decision has been made in  relation to Dalby. 

 JOURNALIST: How many other sites are being looked at? 

 JULIA GILLARD: The department routinely makes inquiries of various sites, so that’s part  of what they do in a consultative process with communities. No decision’s been made about  Dalby. 

 JOURNALIST: Will you challenge for the leadership before or after the election? 

 JULIA GILLARD: You know I’ve answered this question a million times with increasingly  ridiculous sporting analogies. I do note of course that the Dogs are playing the Lions this  weekend, maybe that’s not that smartest thing for me to be saying at a press conference in  Brisbane, but rather than do another sporting analogy can I say what I’ve said all along, the  speculation is, in my view, completely absurd. 

 OK, thank you.
