 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  STEPHEN SMITH, MP 

 

 TRANSCRIPTION: PROOF COPY E & OE 

 DATE:   4 March 2009 

 TITLE:  Press conference - attack on Sri Lankan cricket team, Bali process,  Pakistan, Afghanistan, aid funding 

 

 STEPHEN  SMITH:  Just  make  some  remarks  about  the  attack  on  the  Sri  Lankan  touring   cricket  team  in  Lahore,  and  then  some  remarks  about  the  Bali  process.  Then  I'm  happy  to   respond to your questions.   

 Firstly,  can  I  again  condemn  the  attack  on  the  Sri  Lankan  touring  cricket  team  in  Pakistan   yesterday. This is an atrocious attack.   

 Can I express how pleased I am that the Australians associated with the Sri Lankan touring  party are all uninjured.   

 Two of those, the reserve umpires Steve Davis and Steve Tauffel, left Pakistan yesterday and  flew to the United Arab Emirates, where they were met by consular officials.   

 The  Australians  associated  with  the  coaching  staff,  as  we  speak,  are  scheduled  to  arrive  in   Colombo, together with the Sri Lankan cricket team, on a Sri Lankan Government jet.   

 All of those Australians are unharmed. And whilst they're obviously shocked and shaken, they  are physically uninjured.   

 Yesterday  there  were  reports  that  one  of  them  may  have  been  injured  in  a  minor  way.   Fortunately that hasn't occurred.   

 The Australians arriving in Colombo will again be met by consular officials and offered any  assistance.   

 I spoke to our High Commissioner in Islamabad late last night Canberra time, to confirm all  of those arrangements.   

 I also spoke late last night to Pakistan Foreign Minister Qureshi and I firstly expressed to him  the  condolences  of  the  Government  and  the  Australian  people  for  the  death  of  seven   Pakistanis, six police officers and one bus driver.

 I  indicated  to  him  that  if  it  was  of  any  assistance,  the  resources  of  the  Australian  Federal   Police would be available for investigative and forensic purposes.   

 Foreign Minister Qureshi was grateful to receive that offer and that will be considered.   

 I indicated to Foreign Minister Qureshi that as I had been in Pakistan two weeks previously, I  again made the point that Australia stood shoulder to shoulder with Pakistan at a very difficult  time for Pakistan, both economically and in terms of security.   

 Can  I  make  this  point:  when  the  Australian  Cricket  Board,  when  Cricket  Australia  decided   last year not to tour Pakistan, some public comment was that this was not the correct decision  because cricket was somehow immune from terrorist activity.   

 This  makes  the  point  that  irrespective  of  what  position  you  occupy,  irrespective  of  what   pursuit you follow, you are not immune from terrorist activity. And that is why Australia and  the international community need to stare down the terrorist threat that we see in this region.   

 I made the point when I returned from Pakistan that the very clear impression I was left with  when I had my conversations with President Zardari and Foreign Minister Qureshi and chief  of the armed services Kayani, that Pakistan now understood that what it was dealing with was  not  just  a  problem associated  with  the  Afghanistan-Pakistan  border,  which  had  implications   for Afghanistan, but this was very much an existentialist threat to Pakistan itself.   

 Australia  very  strongly  supports  Pakistan  in  this  difficult  time.  We  are  one  of  the  original   members  of  the  Friends  of  a  Democratic  Pakistan  and  it's  quite  clear  that  the  international   community needs to offer Pakistan a great deal of assistance at this time.   

 Foreign  Minister  Qureshi  indicated  to  me  that  no  stone  will  be  left  unturned  to  bring  the   perpetrators to justice. There are no early indications as to who may be responsible. No one,  on my recent advice, has claimed responsibility.   

 Can I thank Foreign Minister Qureshi. It was quite clear from my conversations with him that  he was very well aware that Australians were associated with the travelling party, and he had  been at pains to ensure knowledge of their safety and wellbeing.   

 Can  I  make  some  remarks  about  the  Bali  process,  then  I'm  happy  to  respond  to  your   questions.   

 Indonesian Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda and I will co-chair a Ministerial meeting of the  Bali Process in Bali on Tuesday the 14th and Wednesday the 15th of April.   

 This is the first meeting of the Bali Process at Ministerial level since 2003. The Bali Process  of  course  is  the  premier  regional  organisation  associated  with  combating  illegal  people   movement, people trafficking and people smuggling.

 And  the  question,  as  Foreign  Minister  Wirajuda  and  I  made  clear  when  Foreign  Minister   Wirajuda  was  in  Sydney  recently,  the  questions  of  the  Rohingyas  from  Burma  and   Bangladesh will be part of that conversation.   

 In  that  respect  can  I  announce  that  the  Australian  Government  will  today  provide  further   assistance  to  the  Rohingya  people  of  Bangladesh  and  Burma.  The  Rohingyas  come  from,   historically, the Rakhine state of Burma and we find very many of the Rohingya people either  in Burma or in Bangladesh.   

 And  I  am  announcing  today  that  the  Australian  Government  will  provide  a  further  $2.5   million  to  the  UNHCR,  the  United  Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees,  to  assist  the   Rohingya people in Burma and in Bangladesh.    

 This  follows  on  from  a  comparable  amount  announced  by  my  colleague,  the  Minster  for   Immigration,  Senator  Evans,  when  the  High  Commissioner  Guterres  was  in  Australia   recently.  This  is  a  comparable  amount  to  assist  displaced  Rohingya  people  in  Bangladesh,   Malaysia and Indonesia.   

 So I'm very pleased to indicate that that formal Ministerial meeting will occur in Bali on the  14th and 15th. This follows on from a senior officials meeting in Brisbane late last month.   

 I'm happy to respond to your questions on those and other matters.   

 QUESTION: Mr Smith, what does this attack in Pakistan mean for cricketers touring in the  sub-continent  more  generally?  Will  it  make  cricketers  going  to  India  think  twice  do  you   think?   

 STEPHEN  SMITH:  Well,  we've  always,  since  we've  been  in  office,  left  those  matters  to   Cricket Australia when it comes to Australian cricketing teams.   

 And in the course of last year when the issue of a Pakistan tour was in question, we provided  to Cricket Australia all of our most up to date travel advisory, security and threat assessments.  Cricket  Australia  came  to  a  conclusion  that  it  should  not  tour  Pakistan  and  subsequent   arrangements have been made for games to be played against Pakistan at neutral venues in the  United Arab Emirates.   

 So far as future tours by Australian teams are concerned, or future tours by other teams are  concerned, clearly, this attack will send shock waves through the cricketing community, will  send shock waves through the ICC.    

 And the ICC, Cricket Australia, and other cricketing authorities will need to bear and weigh  these events very heavily in mind when they come to contemplate tours to Pakistan.   

 Whether the proposed World Cup in 2011 takes place under the current formulation will be a  matter for the ICC. I understand they're meeting as early as next month to contemplate those  arrangements.

 But  these  terrible  events  will  need  to  be  borne  uppermost  in  mind,  not  just  by  Australian   cricketing authorities but by the international authorities.   

 QUESTION: Minister, the conflict between Pakistan and India over Kashmir is often seen as  one of the root causes for extremists in Pakistan. How satisfied is the Australian Government  with efforts to resolve that issue?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well, we very much want to see confidence building measures between  Pakistan and India.   

 When  I  was  in  Pakistan  a  fortnight  ago,  one  of  the  things  I  made  very  clear  was  that  the   Pakistan  authorities  had  a  responsibility  to  respond  to  Indian  requests  for  assistance  and   information on the Mumbai attacks.   

 In the course of my arrival there, the Pakistani authorities responded.   

 So far as Kashmir is concerned, we very much would want to see the constructive dialogue  between India and Pakistan resumed.   

 It's very important for stability and security in South Asia that Pakistan and India have a good  relationship. That relationship has been jeopardised by terrible terrorist activity, whether that  is terrorist activity as a result of the assassination of Mrs Bhutto, the attack on the Marriott 

 Hotel in Pakistan, or Mumbai itself. And now these terrible events in Lahore yesterday.   

 As  Foreign  Minister  Qureshi  has  said  on  a  number  of  occasions,  the  enemy  is  not  India  or   Pakistan, the enemy is terrorism. And we want to see confidence building measures between  India and Pakistan, so that that constructive dialogue can be resumed.    

 QUESTION:  Minister,  what  are  your  agencies  telling  you  as  to  who  is  most  likely  behind   this attack?    

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well at this stage there's no information or advice to that respect. When  I spoke to Foreign Minister Qureshi last night, as I say, there was no claim of responsibility,  and there were no early indications as to whom might be responsible.    

 I regard any attack of this nature on innocent cricketers as automatically defining itself as an  extremist or a terrorist attack. There's no question that this is also a symbolic attack.    

 Very  many  people  have  argued  in  south  Asia  or  in  Australia  that  somehow  because  of  its   status as a game in the subcontinent that cricket was somehow immune from these matters.    

 Well, that is clearly not the case.    

 QUESTION: Minister, can I just ask you, do you think the boldness of this attack might have  any repercussions, further, even in Afghanistan?

 STEPHEN SMITH: Let me go back a step. Once we satisfied ourselves that the Australians  exposed  to  risk  and  danger  were  safe  -  and  that  was  our  highest  priority  yesterday  -  we   immediately moved to more general considerations.    

 One of the fundamental reasons why Australia continues to have a presence in Afghanistan is  because we regard the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, the border area, as the current hot bed of  international terrorism. And I strongly believe it's in Australia's national interests to play its 

 part in staring that back down.   

 And that's why we have a contribution in Afghanistan. That's why the Australian Government  very strongly supports the current reviews being undertaken by the new US Administration,  including the Riedel Review, and why we strongly believe that the answer to these problems  in both Afghanistan and Pakistan is not just a military or an enforcement response, it's also a  nation  building,  or  civil  reconstruction  response.  And  it  also  requires,  at  some  stage,  a   political dialogue.    

 But  to  me,  this  very  much  underlines  the  reasons  why  Australia  plays  its  part  in  the   international community in seeking to stare down and defeat terrorist and extremist activity.    

 Sometimes we think that we are far away from these measures. Well, as events in Bali have  shown us in the last decade and as these events have shown us yesterday, that is not the case.    

 QUESTION: Given the circumstances of what's going on in Pakistan and this attack, do you  think there's any capacity for the NATO Leaders summit to more broadly consider Pakistan as  well as Afghanistan when the leaders meet?    

 STEPHEN  SMITH:  Well  I  make  the  point  very  strongly  that  for  some  time  Pakistan  was   viewed in the context of the border with Afghanistan. Having now been to that border area,  the topography, the terrain, shows you just how porous a border is.    

 For  a  long  time  people  viewed  Pakistan  as  simply  being  part  of  the  difficulty  in  the   Afghanistan border area.    

 We have to start viewing, as an international community, Pakistan in its own right. Pakistan is  a  very  important  strategic  country.  It  is  the  second  largest  Muslim populated  country  in  the   world and on current population projections will overtake Indonesia in the course of the first  half  of  this  century.  It  is  strategically,  very  importantly,  located  within  south  Asia,  close  to   Asia, close to the Middle East. It is strategically very important.    

 It is quite clear that Pakistan faces very severe economic and security challenges and it needs  the assistance of the international community and it needs to be viewed in that light.    

 That's the very strong point that the Australian Government has been making for some time.  And it's also a point that we are making to not just the United States Administration but to our  international colleagues.

 So far as NATO is concerned, NATO of course has the ISAF force in Afghanistan and we are  one of the non-NATO contributors to that, one of the largest non-NATO contributors.    

 I think there's a growing appreciation in the international community - and this was certainly  the  case  when  I  was  last  in  Brussels  late  last  year  where  I  met  with  the  NATO  Secretary   General and the NATO Ambassadors - there was a growing appreciation that Pakistan has its  own very severe and acute security issues. They have to be confronted and Pakistan needs the  assistance of the international community in that respect.    

 QUESTION:  You  said  before  there  had  been  a  belief  that  cricket  was  a  no-go  target  for   terrorists in  Pakistan. I mean,  surely,  if that  threshold's  now  been  breached,  it  must  make  it   riskier for cricket in India, as well, therefore, for Australian cricketers in India.    

 STEPHEN  SMITH:  Well,  again,  that  will  be  a  matter  for  Cricket  Australia,  for  the   Australian cricket authorities.    

 There was, as you'd be well aware, there was recently a tour by the Australian cricket team to  India. I am, off the top of my head, unsure when the next scheduled tour of India is.    

 But since that tour of India, we've seen the attack in Mumbai, and now we've seen this attack  in Lahore on the Sri Lankan cricket team.    

 As  I  said  earlier,  cricketing  authorities,  not  just  Australia,  will  have  to  bear  this  terrible   incident in mind when they come to contemplate the safety and welfare and security of any  touring team.    

 So  that'll  be  a  matter  for  Cricket  Australia.  But  just  as  we  did  with  the  proposed  tour  of   Pakistan,  we  will  ensure,  at  the  appropriate  time,  that  all  of  the  advice  we  have  -  security,   threat assessment, travel advice - is made readily available to Cricket Australia to enable them  to make decisions.    

 Can I make this point about Cricket Australia.    

 I've  had  a  number  of  conversations  with  Cricket  Australia,  with  the  officers  and  also  from   time to time with the players. One thing I say about Cricket Australia is when they come to  make these decisions I'm absolutely of the view that what they bear uppermost in mind is the 

 safety, security, and welfare of the players and the members of the travelling party.    

 QUESTION: Minister, to what extent do you believe that the attack in Lahore is related to  events in Sri Lanka themselves?    

 STEPHEN  SMITH:  Well  I  think  it's  too  early  to  draw  any  connection.  I  see  some  people   have said, in terms of the style of the attack, there was some similarities.  I think it's way too  early  to  draw  any  connection  other  than  the  more  general  point  that  we  have  seen,  in  the  

 course of the last 12 months, terrible terrorist attacks against the people and the Government  of India and against the people and the Government of Pakistan.

 And I very strongly agree with Foreign Minister Qureshi of Pakistan that what these illustrate  is not that the danger or the enemy is India or Pakistan, the danger and the enemy is terrorism  itself.    

 QUESTION: Mr Smith, just on another issue, the Greens are going to move an amendment  in the Senate to overturn a ban on Australian foreign aid funding on abortion advice overseas.  Will the government support that, and if you won't, why won't you?    

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well this is a matter that the Government has had under consideration  for  some  time.  I've  made  it  clear  in  the  recent  past  that  we're  very  close  to  bringing  our   consultations to a conclusion. So I expect we'll be in a position to make an announcement in  the very near future.    

 This  is,  of  course,  a  matter  effectively  for  Ministerial  discretion,  so  I'm  unsure  what  Senate   resolutions may or may not have so far as an impact on that is concerned.    

 As  I've  made  clear,  I  regard  this  as  an  issue  where  there  are  strong  views,  firmly  held,  on   either  side.  I  haven't  indicated  a  personal  view  or  a  personal  preference.  I'll  announce  mine   and the Government's decision in the very very near future.    

 But the various views that are expressed, I think, ought to be - given the nature of what we're  dealing with - respected, irrespective of whether or not you agree with them.    

 QUESTION: Just on the original question, Mr Smith, what would the government's attitude  be to this senate…   

 STEPHEN  SMITH:  Well  the  Government's  attitude  is  that  the  Government  will  make  a   decision, and that will be announced in the very near future. And because it is purely a matter  for Ministerial discretion, I'm not quite sure what relevance a Senate resolution has or doesn't  have.    

 QUESTION: [Inaudible]     

 STEPHEN  SMITH:  Well,  I'm  not  sure  if  it's  relevant.  Our  position  is  crystal  clear.  We've   just about finished our consultations. And I expect to be able to make an announcement in the  very near future.   

 QUESTION:  Mr  Smith,  the  announcement's  been  imminent  for  quite  a  while.  I  mean,  can   you give us an exact sort of time for when it will be announced?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: In the very near future at a time, at a time of my choosing.   

 QUESTION: Are you able to give us an indication of your personal feelings on this issue?   

 STEPHEN  SMITH:  Well,  my  personal  views  will  be  inextricably  interwoven  with  the   decision I make as a Minister.  Which is why I have assiduously avoided indicating what my  personal view may or may not be.

 QUESTION: [Inaudible question]   

 STEPHEN SMITH: Because we regard this as a difficult issue where we have both wanted  to and seen the need for extensive consultations where there are strong views firmly held.    

 And irrespective of the view, whether people disagree or agree with the  view,  I  think  those   views ought to be respected and we will make, as I say, our judgement and our announcement  in the very near future.   

 QUESTION: But [indistinct] the government faces many, many complex matters on which it  makes decisions in a [indistinct]…   

 STEPHEN SMITH: I would rather make a decision, Michelle, that I thought was right then  to make a decision at the request of other people's perceived timetables.   

 QUESTION: What would you say to claims that the Government is reluctant to overturn this  ban because it's [indistinct] Steve Fielding in the Senate?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well, I say simply this, which is what I've always said: we regard this as  a difficult issue where there are strong views firmly held on both sides.    

 Unlike some, I don't make pejorative remarks about people who hold views in this area that I  might happen to personally disagree with.   

 We respect people's views. Whatever decision is made, some people will agree with it, some  people will be unhappy with it, some people will express their support for it and some people  will express their opposition to it.    

 In the end, people in the community will make their own judgement in their own way given  this is very much an issue that goes to personal belief and personal consciousness.   

 QUESTION: [Indistinct] policy in opposition?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: Well, this is always an area where, effectively, it's a matter for personal  individual conscience or choice.   

 QUESTION: So, Labor did not have a policy?   

 STEPHEN SMITH: No.   

 QUESTION: Has Archbishop Pell spoken to you about this? 

 STEPHEN SMITH: I haven't heard a…
