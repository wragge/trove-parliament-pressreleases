 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 Greens condemn 'Indian Ocean solution' 

 26th Apr 05 

 Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today called on the Immigration Minister to  explain the government's plans for Christmas Island detention centre following  reports that all immigration detainees will be held on the island.  The plans to shift all detainees to the island, to be revealed on SBS TV's Insight  programme tonight, have been communicated to the Shire President of Christmas  Island who says that all future unauthorised boat arrivals will be detained there.  "The government should be closing detention centres, not building new ones,"  Senator Nettle said. "Christmas Island's new detention centre serves no purpose  beyond furthering the Coalition's political ends at a cost of over $300 million dollars  to the public.  "If there are no plans to change the role of Christmas Island's detention centre why  is the government spending $300 million on an upgrade?  "This policy change is ultimately about shirking Australia's responsibilities under the  UN Convention on Refugees and hiding the ugly reality of mandatory detention as  as possible from the public gaze.  "To keep asylum seekers locked up on Christmas Island will make it far more  difficult for detainees to access legal assistance, to receive visitors, to receive  proper medical care, interpretation services and support from their ethnic  communities.  "The Cornelia Rau scandal has shone the spotlight on a detention system that  systematically damages people's mental health. The Christmas Island hospital does  not have a psychiatric unit, nor do psychiatrists visit Christmas Island. To receive a  psychiatric assessment, detainees would have to fly 2,630 kilometres to Perth.  "One wonders if Cornelia Rau had ended up on Christmas Island whether she'd  have ever been found."
