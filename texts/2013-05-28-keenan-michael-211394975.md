 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH OF OVER  3,000 ILLEGAL BOAT ARRIVALS May 28, 2013

 The arrival of two more illegal boats, with a total of more than 160 people on board, means May is the second consecutive month  in  which  more  than  3,000  people  have  arrived  by  illegal  boat,  Shadow  Minister  for  Immigration  and  Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “Labor’s surrender on our borders has seen two consecutive months of more than 3,000 illegal boat arrivals and the end result will be more cost, chaos and tragedy,” Mr Morrison said.

 “These latest arrivals come as Immigration Department officials this week confirmed at Senate Estimates that Labor have based their budget on 13,200 people arriving on illegal boats next financial year.

 “This  is  despite  the  fact  that  more  than  22,000  illegal  arrivals  have  come  so  far  this  financial  year,  a  figure  which  the Department said could hit 25,000 by the end of June.

 “Labor always underestimates the cost of their failure on our borders, an underestimation currently running at more $10 billion of taxpayer’s money and counting on their watch,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr  Keenan  said:  “Another  two  illegal  boat  arrivals,  carrying  163  passengers,  were  intercepted,  bringing  the  total  to  12 boats and nearly 900 people in the last week alone.

 “This  occurred  on  a  day  when  the  Prime  Minister  has  refused  to  acknowledge  that  damaging  cuts  to  our  agencies  is endangering national security.

 “These  national  security  lapses  include  the  placing  of  an  accused  Egyptian  terrorist  in  the  low  security  Inverbrackie Detention Centre and releasing an accused Sri Lankan murderer into the community.

 “Labor’s border protection  failures have allowed over 42,000 people to arrive in Australia illegally by boat and criminals have started to take advantage of this failure.

 “The Government cannot be trusted to stop the boats and they cannot be trusted to prioritise national security in the same way as the Coalition,” Mr Keenan said.
