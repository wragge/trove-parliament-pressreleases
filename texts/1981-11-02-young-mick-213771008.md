 The Sinai Debate

 Unfortunately the issue of Australia committing troops to the  Middle East specifically the Sinai has been overwhelmed by  debates on Camp David, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and American 

 policy. I see the question much more simply.  Is it in  Australia's best interests to commit our troops overseas in  these forces.

 The Sinai is part of a wider region of confrontation and whilst  the situation is not analagous to Vietnam I am certainly influ­ enced by our Vietnam experience where our troops were committed  under very questionable circumstances.

 That the major powers, i.e. the U.S., France, U.K., may commit  their troops,  is quite a different matter for they are a signif­ icant influence in the Middle East both with the Israeli Govern­ ment and many of the Arab Governments and most certainly the  wish of us all is that we can see a permanent peace in the 

 region.

 But no-one can guarantee that our commitment of 200 troops in ,y  1981 will not be 2,000 troops in 1982 or that Australia's /  commitment may get out of depth with the role that we should  be playing near our region.

 Vis advantaged Health Ca&ds

 The largest number of applica­ tions by Immigrants and/or  refugees for "Disadvantaged 

 Health Cards" between 3.8.81  and 1.9.81 were received from  Fairfield - 519 applications.

 According to the "new" regula­ tions announced by the Govern­ ment, newly arrived immigrants  and refugees are eligible for 

 6 months free medical care if  they are issued with a "Dis­ advantaged Health Card".

 Other centres from where large  numbers of applications were  received were Inala (Qld) 246,  Maroubra (NSW) 180, Liverpool 

 (NSW) 171, Perth West (WA) 155  Woodville (SA) 140 and Wollon­ gong (NSW) 106. The Central  Benefits office in Victoria 

 has also received 700 applica­ tions.

 NAATI Unable, to  Cope.

 The National Accreditation  Authority for Translators and  Interpreters since its incep­ tion in 1977 has received some 

 5,500 applications from people  seeking accreditation as trans­ lators and interpreters in 80  different languages at Levels 

 I to V.

 NAATI has not yet been able to  arrange tests in all languages  i for which there is a demand.

 '  The recent cut-back in staff

 and the recommendations con­ tained in the Razor Gang's Re­ port regarding the introduction  of fees, NAATI, translators and 

 interpreters will certainly not  improve the situation.

 Qualified, to  become. Austhollan  C itizens Nearly 1.2 million people over  the age of 16 are residentially 

 qualified to become Australian  citizens. As you might be  aware, starting from 1 January  1982 only Australian citizens  will be eligible to vote in 

 Federal Elections. However,   those British subjects who were  residents of Australia prior to  that date will preserve their 

 existing rights.

 The following table is an indi­ cation of the number of people  eligible to become Australian  citizens as at 30 June 1980.

 A u sh alla-B ritain  Society

 According to a reply given to  Mr Peter Morris by the Prime  Minister the Australia-Britain  Society has received $150,000 

 in 1980/81.

 To the question "What alloca­ tions are made to similar asso­ ciations of persons of non-  Anglo-Saxon origin", Mr Fraser 

 replied "None".

 He also added that "a similar  situation does not exist vis-a­ vis other societies in Austra­ lia like the Australia-Britain 

 Society ... The centre's objec­ tive, which this Government  wholeheartedly supports is to  strengthen the relationship be­

 tween Australia and Britain", Mr Fraser said.

 B l-llngual 0{{lcehs Ovehseas?

 Members of the ethnic community  often argue that better use  should be made of people with  language skills or people from  a non-Anglo-Saxon background

 when choosing officers for an  overseas post.

 In spite of repeated requests  very little has been done as yet  to achieve this goal. According  to Mr Macphee "The needs of  personnel working overseas in  non-English-speaking countries  were subject of a detailed in­

 ternal review in 1977. More  recently, these needs were the  subject of an inter-departmental  committee review co-ordinated by  the Dept, of Foreign Affairs in 

 1980 to which this Department  (Immigration) contributed. A  survey is currently underway of  the language capabilities of  Departmental officers."

 Let's hope that there are going  to be less enquiries and more  action in the future.
