Cabinet has reaffirmed its decision to streamline the present merits review
system through amalgamation of a number of existing tribunals into an
independent Administrative Review Tribunal.

 As Cabinet decided
in March, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Social Security Appeals
Tribunal, the Immigration Review Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal and
the Veterans Review Board would be amalgamated to form a new Administrative
Review Tribunal.

 That in-principle decision followed
consideration of the Better Decisions report from the Administrative Review
Council which recommended amalgamation.

 An Inter-Departmental
Committee was established to devise a strategy for implementation of the
decision. The committee will report to Cabinet in due course.

The Cabinet is firm in its resolve that any proposal for reform of the
merits review tribunals is not to affect the level of independence of such
bodies in reaching decisions and it is confident that the report of the
interdepartmental committee will be consistent with this aim.
