 AUSTRALIA PROVIDES SUPPORT TO DISPLACED  PEOPLE OVERSEAS   

 The Federal Government has allocated more than $7 million towards overseas  assistance projects supporting displaced and vulnerable people overseas, the Minister  for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, said today from Sri Lanka.    

 Mr Bowen, who is on a five-day visit to India and Sri Lanka, said funding was allocated  for 15 projects, including five projects supporting displaced Sri Lankan people through  improved health services and provision of shelter and protection.   

 “The Government’s Displaced Persons Program (DPP) focuses on improving the lives of  displaced people across the globe, with more than $2.7 million this financial year going  to assisting displaced Sri Lankans,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “The Australian Government is committed to helping people overseas return to their  homes safely after fleeing dangerous situations.     

 “By improving the quality of life for people in their home countries, this funding also  helps to remove the incentive for people to pay people smugglers and attempt  dangerous boat journeys to Australia.   

 “Through this program, international and non-governmental organisations have been  funded to implement a range of projects that look to long-term solutions for refugees  and displaced persons.   

 “Only this week I visited one of the projects we have previously funded in New Delhi  that helps refugees in India gain skills and employment, and saw first-hand the positive  impact this program can have.”   

 Among the organisations to receive funding for their proposed projects are the  International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations High Commissioner  for Refugees (UNHCR), CARE Australia and ChildFund Australia.   

 The 2011-12 DPP is focused on assisting displaced persons with their basic needs,  through projects such as the one operated by ChildFund Australia, which provides food  security by supporting farm-based livelihoods for vulnerable people.    

 “Australia continues to show its strong support for vulnerable and displaced people  through vital programs such as this,” Mr Bowen said.
