 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Tuesday 06 August 2013    

 Greens announce policy for Refugee Health  Panel    

 Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, joined Greens health  spokesperson, Dr Richard Di Natale, to announce that the Greens would establish an independent  health oversight panel for refugees.    

 “The old parties are storming ahead with the race to refugee cruelty as they races to the polls,  showing complete disregard for the physical and mental health of the people affected,” Greens’  immigration spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.    

 “The government must listen to the experts and support the Greens’ bill to establish a Refugee  Health Panel, bringing oversight and health care to the people in remote island prisons.      

 “Indefinite detention is disastrous to refugees’ mental health and wellbeing. There has to be a safety  net of expert, independent care for these very vulnerable people.    

 “The government wants to send families and unaccompanied children to an offshore tent slum on  Nauru, but to do so without proper healthcare would be unthinkable.”    

 Greens health spokesperson, Dr Richard Di Natale, will be discussing the policy in a speech to the  Victorian AMA tonight.    

 “The medical community is rightly concerned about the government’s approach to asylum seekers.  It violates the central tenant of the Hippocratic Oath - first, do no harm,” said Dr Di Natale.    

 “Long-term detention of vulnerable people will lead to an epidemic of mental health disease  resulting in suicides, self-harm, long term depression and anxiety related disorders. Not to mention  the poor health facilities.    

 “This is about caring for people and when it comes down to it, the Greens are the only ones that are  standing up for the health and wellbeing of refugees.”

 In the rush to set up cruel detention camps and slum cities,  there is no plan for independent oversight of refugees’ health  and care. The old parties are committed to dumping all  refugees who come by boat out-of-sight, out-of-mind in the  poorest nations in our region, with no safeguards for their  medical and mental health needs.  

 Reports from whistle-blowers and the UNHCR already tell us  that conditions in the camps are harsh and dangerously  inadequate, but there is no transparency about what is  happening in Australia’s name. 

 > SAFEGUARDING THE HEALTH OF  PEOPLE IN AUSTRALIA’S CARE  The Australian Greens want to put a stop to offshore detention  altogether.  But while it is in place, Australia remains  responsible for looking after the health and wellbeing of  refugees  we send to detention camps. There must be special  oversight of the impacts of indefinite detention on these  already traumatised people.  

 The Greens will establish an independent panel of medical and  mental health experts to provide transparent public oversight  and rigorously monitor the needs and wellbeing of vulnerable  people sent by Australia to Nauru and PNG.  

 The Independent Health Advisory Panel would: 

 ï· be selected from a pool of experts nominated by Australia’s  peak medical, psychiatric and psychological  bodies; 

 ï· be self-directed in the nature of their investigations; 

 ï· have access to all offshore facilities and personnel; 

 ï· be independent of the Minister and report directly to the  Parliament every 6 months. 

 The Panel would be tasked with reporting on the health  conditions inside detention camps, investigating deficiencies in  care, and making recommendations for improving the medical  and mental health care that refugees sent offshore can access. 

 > FAILING REFUGEES’ WELLBEING IS  FAILING OUR DUTY OF CARE  The boat voyage that brings refugees to our shores seeking  sanctuary is the last stage in a long and often dangerous  journey. After traumatic experiences and long periods in unsafe  conditions, the physical and mental health needs of refugees  and asylum seekers can be complex. This means that refugees in  detention need access to comprehensive, modern health care  facilities and expert help. 

 We have already seen numerous reports of the damage caused  to adults and children by detention in Nauru, Manus Island,  Christmas Island and the Australian mainland. Each report is  more worrying that the last, highlighting serious problems with  the physical and mental health of asylum seekers in detention.

 i  

 The history of personal trauma, the hot and steamy conditions,  the limited resources including limited fresh water, the risk of  disease, the remoteness and the high levels of distress about  the future, all add up to a dangerously difficult environment for  maintaining the good health and wellbeing of refugees.  

 Australia is raiding our foreign aid budget to spend over $8  billion on offshore asylum seeker management, and is  outsourcing basic medical care to commercial contractors. ii

 

 Given the horror stories emerging from the detention camps,  this arrangement is unacceptable and the full transparency and  oversight of the Independent Health Advisory Panel is urgently  needed. Now that Labor is committed to dumping hundreds of  children and unaccompanied minors in Nauru, rigorous health  oversight are essential.  

 REFUGEE HEALTH AND WELLBEING  INDEPENDENT HEALTH ADVISORY PANEL   An expert panel to monitor the health of refugees in offshore detention 

 The old parties are risking the health and wellbeing  of thousands of refugees, including children, by  dumping them in appalling conditions in Nauru and  Papua New Guinea.  A caring nation looks after  people fleeing persecution and their physical and  mental health.

 Australia recognises that people have a right to health care. We  have a duty to look after the basic health needs of people under  our protection.  In sending vulnerable people offshore, the first  step should have been to establish an expert advisory  committee to review and oversee the protections conditions as  recommended by the Houston Panel.

 iii    

 Despite public promises by the Government that a degree of  health oversight would be provided, there has been no review  and oversight of offshore detention so far. iv

  The Greens are not 

 willing to leave refugee health and well-being to chance. 

 > PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE TO CARE  FOR REFUGEES  The Independent Health Advisory Panel would be composed of  experts nominated by professional bodies for their expertise in  relevant medical and psychological fields. This ensures only the  most highly-qualified experts will be on the panel. 

 By restricting the panel to people who are nominated for their  expertise by medical bodies concerned only with the health of  patients, we ensure true independence. The experts have  professional and ethical obligations entirely separate from the  political and bureaucratic priorities of the Department and the  Minister. 

 > INDEPENDENT AND TRUSTWORTHY  EXPERT OVERSIGHT  The Independent Health Advisory Panel will report to  Parliament every 6 months on the conditions in detention  facilities and the challenges to delivering sound health care. 

 The Australian Parliament, and the public, will see the report at  the same time as the Immigration Minister, ensuring there is no  opportunity for political interference in the contents of the  report. The Government’s response to these reports would then  be made in full public view of the realities of the situation on  the ground - not a redacted report from a government  contractor. 

 The Greens have already introduced a bill into the Parliament to  implement this policy, so there is no reason why this important  oversight measure should be delayed. 

 The Greens will provide an initial $2 million over the forward  estimates to resource the work of the Panel. 

 The Independent Health Advisory Panel is supported by the  Australian Human Rights Commission, v  the Australian Medical 

 Association and other health experts. vi  

 

 

 > BETTER ALTERNATIVES  The old parties’ cruel policies of dumping refugees in indefinite  detention and inadequate ‘resettlement’ in our region’s poorest  nations will inevitably lead to further trauma and harm. There  have already been terrible disclosures of self-harm, mental ill-health and even alleged sexual abuse which shows that the  current level of care and oversight is not adequate. 

 The Greens would offer people safer pathways than boats by  increasing our humanitarian intake, particularly from Indonesia,  and house all asylum seekers in the Australian community after  security and medical checks have been conducted. The evidence  is clear that this approach is more humane, billions of dollars  cheaper, and leads to better outcomes for all involved.  

 Until the Greens’ humane and effective refugee policy is  adopted, the Australian government must put in place health  and wellbeing safeguards for all refugees sent offshore through  establishing an Independent Health Advisory Panel.
