 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling Illegal boat arrivals strain Labor’s weak grip  on detention network  January 21, 2013

 The latest two boat arrivals, carrying a total of 69 people, comes at a time when Labor’s grip on the immigration detention  network is weak and riddled with problems, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan  said.

 “The 550th illegal boat to arrive since Labor dismantled the Coalition’s working border protection regime comes at a time  when the Gillard Labor Government are losing their ability to keep their detention network in check,” Mr Keenan said.

 “The legal challenge against the Manus Island detention centre is just another notch in a long list of border protection  failures manifested by this Government.

 “We are seeing once again that the Gillard Government haven’t done their homework when it comes to managing offshore  detention centres - they clearly have not ensured the key parties in the host country are on board,” he said.

 “The former Coalition Government effectively ran an offshore detention centre in Papua New Guinea and Nauru along  with running a competent and successful border protection regime that virtually stopped the boats.

 “With 234 people having arrived since 1 January, 2013 is shaping up to be another year which the Australian people will  have to endure further incompetent management of our borders, further waste of taxpayers money and further illegal boat  arrivals placing strain on a system that cannot be effectively controlled by this Government.

 “Only the Coalition has an untarnished history of managing our border protection system - we have stopped the boats  from coming in the past and we will do it again,” Mr Keenan said.
