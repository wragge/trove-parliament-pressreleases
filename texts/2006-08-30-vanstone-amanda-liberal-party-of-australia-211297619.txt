 Tough Border Security Opens the Door for 148 In Need 

 30 August 2006 

 Australia's commitment to border security has again allowed the welcome mat to be rolled  out for 148 refugee and humanitarian entrants this week.  

 "By maintaining our tough stance on border security, Australia can offer protection to  greater numbers of people, determined by the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR) to be most in need of resettlement,"Minister for Immigration and 

 Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, said.  

 "Australia is able to offer a home to refugees, stranded outside their country of nationality  and unable to return because of a real fear of persecution.  

 "Of the 148 people arriving this week, 90 are refugees. Many have been waiting in refugee  camps for years." 

 "The remaining 58 people are Special Humanitarian Program (SHP) entrants. They have  been forced to leave their home country after being subject to substantial discrimination  and also have family or other links with Australia." 

 Of the 148 people arriving, 115 are from Africa , 31 are from the Middle East and South  West Asia, and two are from South East Asia .  

 These are all entrants under Australia 's refugee and humanitarian programme, which  provides 13,000 places each year.  

 "There are 33 family groups amongst this week's scheduled arrivals, including four women  granted visas under a dedicated programme for women at risk," Senator Vanstone said.    

 "These are women who have lost male family members and are therefore particularly  vulnerable."  

 The refugee and humanitarian entrants arriving this week are expected to settle across  Australia as follows:
