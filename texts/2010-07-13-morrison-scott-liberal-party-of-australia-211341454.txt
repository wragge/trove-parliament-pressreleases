 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 Gillard’s “never never” solution  rejected by East Timor as another boat  arrives   13/07/10  

 The rejection of Julia Gillard’s ‘never never’ solution for asylum seekers in East  Timor has coincided with yet another boat arrival, Shadow Minister for Immigration  and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and  Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 “The Parliament of East Timor has rightly delivered a vote of no confidence in Julia  Gillard’s attempt to use their country as a prop for an election solution on asylum  seekers,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “The unanimous resolution is another international rebuff for Julia Gillard’s ‘never  never’ solution on asylum seekers and her attempt to make policy on the run,” he said. 

 “East Timor’s rejection shows that only the Coalition can be trusted to deliver real  action to stop the unprecedented illegal arrival of 145 boats so far to Australia under  Labor’s failed policies. 

 “The arrival of the 77th boat this year highlights that Julia Gillard cannot spin the  boats away. She needs a real solution, not an election solution. 

 “The circumstances of this arrival, with several passengers transferred for medical  treatment after the vessel ran out of fuel, once again highlights the dangers associated  with this journey. 

 “We have now had 3,814 people arrive illegally by boat in 2010. This is the second  highest number of arrivals in a calendar year, and it is only July. 

 “Julia Gillard has sought to treat the people of East Timor as a political convenience  in the lead up to an election campaign. Her actions have further undermined our  credibility on these important matters in the region and show once again how Labor  always put their political interests first,” he said. 

 Mr Keenan said: “It comes as no surprise that people smugglers don’t take this Labor  Government seriously on border protection after the behaviour we have witnessed  over the past week. 

 “No competent government announces a policy that critically depends on co-operation of a foreign government without sitting around the negotiating table first. 

 “It is time to admit that this farce has now reached the end of the road and it is  completely pointless to waste taxpayer’s money and officials’ time by sending them  to East Timor to pretend that this idea is anything other than stone dead. 

 “The Coalition has a sound and proven border protection policy that will stop the  boats from arriving. 

 “Labor have a half baked plan which was designed to grab a headline and get them  through the election - not fix the problem they created themselves,” he said.
