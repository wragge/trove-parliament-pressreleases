 Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

 Democrats: Government’s Migration Bill No. 6 is in contravention of United Nations

 The Australian Democrats support the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ view that the Howard Government’s Migration Legislation Bill (No.6) 2001 could lead to contravention of the most fundamental principles of the Refugee Convention, bringing Australia’s standing into international disrepute.

 The Australian Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said the United Nations High Commissioner’s (UNHCR) statement came part way through today’s (Friday 21 September 2001) Legal and Constitutional Committee Meeting, which is considering the legal and constitutional implications of Migration Legislation Bill (No. 6) 200l.

 “This is one of seven Migration Bills going before the Senate next week, but it is the only Bill to be considered under the terms of reference of the Legal and Constitutional Committee,” said Senator Bartlett.

 “Late last week, the Opposition sided with the Government to deny a Senate motion to have the remaining Migration Bills separated and sent to the Legal and Constitutional Committee for similar consideration.

 “Views and concerns expressed in the Committee by the UNHCR and the Democrats have caused consternation among members of the Howard Government.

 “The Government is now seeking to derail due process by cutting short the Legal and Constitutional Committee’s time for consideration and reporting - and this comes after only four hours of discussion,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
