I have today announced the appointment of Ms Hillary Clare Brown as
Australia's Honorary Consul in Chiang Mai, Thailand, with jurisdiction
throughout the provinces of Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Lamphun, Lampang, Mae
Hong Son, Phayao, Phrae, Nan, Uttaradit, Sukhotai and Tak.

 Ms
Brown is a New Zealand citizen with close ties to Australia. She has lived
in Chiang Mai for twelve years and operates a business and communications
centre in the city.

 Australia has enjoyed a close and
cooperative relationship with Thailand over many years, reflecting our
geographical proximity, shared strategic perspectives and mutual economic
interests. Our bilateral relationship spans a wide range of fields including
trade, education, defence cooperation, tourism, narcotics control, refugee
resettlement and development cooperation.

 The appointment is a
reflection of the importance of Chiang Mai as a tourist destination and the
significant Australian presence in northern Thailand.
