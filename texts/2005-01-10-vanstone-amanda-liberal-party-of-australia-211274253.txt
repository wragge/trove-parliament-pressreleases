 Most Arrivals in a Decade to Western Australia

 VPS 004/2005

 Western Australia attracted the largest number of migrants and refugee entrants in a decade in 2003-04, the Minister for Immigration and  Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today.

 More than 15 000 people arrived and settled in Western Australia in 2003-04, an increase of more than 3000 from the previous years total of 12  279.

 ‘The increase is in line with a general upwards trend over the past decade - in 1993-94 just 7700 settlers arrived in Western Australia,’ Senator  Vanstone said.

 ‘This means that in the past 10 years Western Australian arrivals have increased by almost 100 per cent and the national increase has been 60 per  cent, with well over 200 countries represented.

 ‘Australia has a wonderfully rich and diverse society as a result, with nearly one in four of Australia’s 20 million people born overseas.’

 Australia-wide, the largest number of people came from the United Kingdom (18 000), followed by people from New Zealand, China, India, South  Africa, the Sudan and the Philippines.

 ‘On top of these figures are the growing numbers of people becoming permanent residents after arriving in Australia, such as overseas students  who apply for skilled migration onshore,’ Senator Vanstone said.

 ‘Our ongoing commitment to new and innovative visa programs and the increased efficiency and integrity of immigration processing means that  Australia continues to attract more and more people from around the globe.’
