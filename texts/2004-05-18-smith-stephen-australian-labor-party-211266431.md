 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP - MIGRATION INSTITUTE OF  AUSTRALIA WA BRANCH STATE CONFERENCE, OLD SWAN  BREWERY, PERTH, TUESDAY, 18 MAY 2004   

 SUBJECT: BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE PACIFIC SOLUTION,  BUSINESS MIGRATION, NEWSPOLL   

 SMITH: A couple of points today.  Firstly the ‘Pacific Solution’.  We’ve seen  over the weekend and yesterday the Government announce refugee’s status for  substantial numbers of Afghans.  This is essentially the beginning of the end of the  Pacific Solution.  The government should stand up, not slip people out the back door  from Nauru, but stand up and say the Pacific Solution has outlived its usefulness and  they should now adopt Labor’s policy and end it.   

 

 There is an issue with the remaining Iraqis on Nauru.  The Government recently  recommenced consideration of Iraqis on Temporary Protection Visas and the  Government should indicate what it proposes to do with the consideration of Iraqis on 

 Nauru.  I’ve made it clear consistently that we will respond positively to any sensible  transitional arrangements that the Government suggest so far as current detainees on  Nauru are concerned.   

 Secondly, you see form reports published today of alarming statistic so far as the  failure of the Government’s current business migration program is concerned.  I  regard the business migration component of our migration intake as being important.   It provides an important economic and social contribution to our migration program.   It is clear that the changes that the Government made in the last couple of years  putting the program on a much more temporary basis, haven’t worked.  This is clearly  an area where there is a need for a substantial review and as I’ve indicated to the  Institute’s conference today, that’s what I would propose to do as Minister.   

 JOURNALIST: Has the ‘Pacific Solution’ been a flat out failure, or as you have  suggested, has it outlived its life?   

 SMITH: I’ve never believed as the Government asserts that having children in  detention or detaining people on Nauru operates as a deterrent.  The Minister is out  there and the Prime Minister is out there, essentially wanting to have their cake and  eat it too.  On the one hand they want to continue to mount the argument they  mounted in the last election that children in detention and the Pacific Solution acts as  a deterrent.  On the other hand The Minister is slipping as many children out of 

 immigration detention as she can, and slipping as many people off Nauru as she can,  so she can whisper out the side of her mouth to certain sections of the community that  they shouldn’t worry, the numbers are now very small.  The Government wants to  have its cake and eat it too. 

 

 The ‘Pacific Solution’ has been very costly.  $170 million to date and still $300  million in the forward estimates.  So it ahs been a very costly exercise.  It’s never in  my view operated as a deterrent.  We do need to detain people as part of our  immigration arrangements.  But that should be done by Commonwealth Officers on  Commonwealth Territory including Christmas Island.  We shouldn’t be outsourcing  our immigration detention and processing arrangements to international companies or  to foreign countries, which is what we’ve done with the ‘Pacific Solution’.   

 JOURNALIST: What would a Labor Government do with what’s happening in  Nauru?   

 SMITH: As I’ve said, we would end the ‘Pacific Solution’.  I have made that  clear.  We would end that essentially on day one.  We would place sensible  transitional arrangements for those detainees who were left on Nauru at the time.   Those transitional arrangements would include further processing and consideration,  either on Christmas Island or on mainland Australia, on a sensible transitional basis.   What I’m calling on the Government to do is essentially adopt that now.  If you do it  now, by the time the next election comes this problem will be solved and the ‘Pacific  Solution’ will be at an end.   

 JOURNALIST: What’s the problem with the Business Migration process?   

 SMITH: We’ve seen in the last couple of years the Government change the  basis of the Business Migration program to essentially a two year temporary visa.   The statistics we see published today show that what putting the program on a  temporary basis has done.  It has acted as a substantial disincentive to those people 

 wanting to come to Australia as business migrants, because that requires a substantial  investment.  It’s clearly the case that putting the program on a much more temporary  basis has operated as a disincentive to those people who might seek to come to  Australia as business migrants.     

 It’s clearly the case that that program needs to be reviewed and the commitment I  gave the Institute’s Conference today is that as Minister for Immigration in a Labor  Government, I would do that.  It’s clearly the case that we need to put that program on 

 a more certain basis.  Whether that’s a return to the program we hade four or five  years ago, which the Government changed, is a separate question.  But certainly we  continue to need, in my view, to have a business migration intake to Australian.  Our  current problem is the Government’s changed arrangements have seen that program  fall in a heap.   

 JOURNALIST: Can we get your reaction to reports that suggest the  Government’s big spending Budget hasn’t necessarily bought support?   

 SMITH: I see there’s a Newspoll out today.  The last time I was asked about a  Newspoll was when Labor had apparently suffered a downturn.  I see today that 

 we’ve got a bit of an upswing.  My comment is exactly the same.  Don’t worry too  much about fortnightly changes.     

 The most important thing that this Newspoll shows, is what they have been showing  essentially for the bulk of this year.  Which is we now have a political competition.     

 Since Mark Latham became Leader of the Party, there is now a political competition  as to who will win the next election.  And when there’s a competition and it’s the  Grand Final, then on the day you can always win.  So I think that polls today simply  underline the fact there’s a political competition and in the end that’s the competition  that I am confident that Mark Latham and Labor can win
