 EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY

  

  

  ADDRESS TO THE FEDERATION OF ETHNIC COMMUNITIES’ COUNCILS OF AUSTRALIA 
ANNUAL CONFERENCE 

  20 NOVEMBER 1998

  BRISBANE

  

  

 Part 
of the preparation for a speech to an important gathering such as FECCA’s 
annual conference is to look at what you have said to the same gathering 
on previous occasions. I can save you the repetition, and myself from 
allegations of plagiarism. When I looked at my last address, I discovered 
it was to a conference in March of this year.

  

 I 
will probably be corrected on this later, but by my count this is now 
two annual conferences in one year. Now we know where productivity growth 
in the Australian economy comes from!

  

 In 
all seriousness, I had some very important messages for this conference 
when I addressed you back in March. I am here today to tell you that 
the intervention of an election campaign changes none of the commitments 
I made to you 8 months ago.

  

 Then, 
I spoke of simple yet powerful commitments to defend publicly our multicultural 
and multiracial society. I spoke of Labor’s strong belief in the way 
successive generations of immigrants have strengthened our society. 
And I gave you commitments from the ALP to bring responsibility for 
multicultural affairs back into the Prime Minister’s department, to 
implement the long-delayed anti-racism campaign, to re-inforce the role 
of citizenship, and to work towards an overarching population policy 
for Australia.

  

 All 
these commitments I re-state to you today, and re-commit the Opposition 
to their pursuit over the next 3 years. I do this because Australia’s 
ethnic communities deserve a consistent policy approach. People who 
are making a life-long commitment to their new home deserve a commitment 
to their wellbeing, and the issues that matter to them.

  

  I think that a consistent message has never been more important than 
now.

  

 During 
the term of the last Parliament, we faced in the form of the One Nation 
Party a grave challenge to the unity and harmony of our multicultural 
Australian society.

  

 We 
may allow ourselves a very brief moment of satisfaction that as a nation 
we have stared down that challenge, and inflicted a substantial defeat 
on its standard-bearer in this recent Federal election. But that moment 
must be brief. We cannot celebrate, and we may not rest.

  

 We 
owe little thanks to the conservative parties on this. Were it not for 
the ALP’s steadfastness, and strong community pressure from yourselves, 
we would now be in the same position in the Federal Parliament as Queenslanders 
face in theirs. For some considerable time, aid and comfort for One 
Nation came from the top of the Coalition. At best, Coalition members 
simply washed their hands of the issue. Even in the election campaign, 
some National Party Members still gave their preferences to One Nation.

  

 One 
Nation, and parties like it, are down, but they are not out.

  

 We 
must recognise that the One Nation Party received nearly I million first 
preference votes all around the country. They outpolled the Democrats, 
and they outpolled the National Party. In terms of first preference 
voter support, they are the third largest party in Australia, behind 
the Labor Party and the Liberal Party.

  

 They 
achieved that result as a first-time party in a Federal election, and 
after putting in one of the most disastrous election campaign performances 
in political history.

  

 And 
so I say to you — the issue remains on the table.

  

 Tim 
Fischer used a wonderful metaphor — more descriptive than he imagines 
-when he said that the National Party had ‘got out of jail’ in the 
last Federal election at the expense of One Nation. Yes, they did get 
out of jail, but it is we who sprung them, and now Mr Fischer’s own 
NSW branch wants to follow his still undisciplined Queensland colleagues 
and commit the offences all over again. I have seen reports that the 
National Party will preference One Nation candidates in the NSW State 
election.

  

 What 
needs to be realised is that the confusion in which One Nation finds 
itself, and the disenchantment among its followers as a result of its 
highly dictatorial party structure, may well decline if the party is 
successful in improving its position in the upcoming NSW State Election. 
The vagaries of the NSW Upper House, where 3% of the vote gets you a 
seat, and the threatened National Party action on preferences will permit 
just that.

  

 We 
guard ourselves against a One Nation resurgence by keeping the pressure 
on the major parties to hold the line (or find the line in the first 
place) on preferences.

  

 But 
we also keep up the fight against intolerance by keeping our messages 
clear and consistent.

  

 As 
I said earlier, the ALP changes nothing of its stance before the election. 
What is disturbing is that the conservative parties are showing a similar 
consistency with attitudes they have no reason to be proud of.

  

 Last 
time I attended this FECCA conference, I spoke about John Howard’s 
answer to a Question Without Notice in one of his first Question Times 
as Prime Minister, in which he took an opportunity to set out some pretty 
uncompromising rhetoric on immigration and unemployment.

  

 A 
more subtle repetition of the theme was there in the opening week of 
this new Parliament. We had last week the first question asked in the 
Parliament by the new Liberal Member for Blair, Cameron Thompson — 
the man who many of us — including Labor people — were pleased to 
see defeat Pauline Hanson in the election. In fact, he won the seat 
thanks to around 13,000 Australian Labor Party preferences.

  

 His 
first question — as we well know supplied by the Government — bears 
repeating here, and I quote:

  

 “I 
address my question to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural 
Affairs. Can the Minister inform the House of the impact of the changes 
that the government introduced on 1 July in relation to work rights 
for people seeking asylum in Australia? Is the Minister aware of any 
proposal to disallow the regulation? What would be the impact of this 
disallowance?”

  

 I 
do not want to go into the detail of it here, except to say that we 
do need eternal vigilance to prevent those with illegitimate claims 
from entering Australia and seeking innovative legal avenues to exploit 
loopholes in a law that is there to assist people in cases of genuine 
need — particularly refugees. Though we disagree with the Government’s 
approach, I do not question their right to have this question asked 
and answered in the Parliament.

  

 What 
I do question is why that question as the first question to itself on 
these issues in the new House?

  

 Why 
not a question to the new Minister assisting the Prime Minister on reconciliation, 
opening up the possibility of a reconsideration of the stolen generation? 
Or a question on the anti-racism campaign, or indeed a question on the 
new multicultural showcase recently launched by the Government?

  

 As 
a question from the Member for Blair, why not something about the need 
to take seriously a decent regional employment policy?

  

 In 
particular, the anti-racism campaign could have done with a better airing, 
having been launched the same day as the tax package was announced, 
and hence being a mite overshadowed on the day. At the very least, this 
was an opportunity to draw a line under the uneasiness so many felt 
about this Government’s attitude to immigration and multiculturalism 
during the last Parliament.

  

 It 
was not taken, and that is a matter for some regret.

  

 As 
I said earlier, I take this opportunity to outline the broad policy 
continuity the ALP brings to issues concerning Australia’s ethnic 
communities. As with all other areas of policy, we will need to adapt 
specific policies to events over the coming 3 years, but always within 
the framework I outline to you today.

  

 That 
framework is built on three beliefs: firstly, that Governments must 
take a strong public role in recognising Australia’s multicultural 
reality, and that where necessary, Governments must be there to defend 
against any attacks on the unity and harmony of our society. Secondly, 
that migrants to Australia should be encouraged to make the commitment 
of becoming Australian citizens. And thirdly, we believe that in the 
longer term, Government must lead a debate on a proper population policy 
for Australia.

  

 In 
each of these areas, we retain an important policy continuity from the 
last Parliament.

  

 To 
begin with, we re-affirm our support for an anti-racism campaign. To 
some extent, events are overtaking us with the Government finally announcing 
its own campaign. But to a large extent, events have not nearly caught 
up with where we believe the debate should be. I find it profoundly 
depressing that the Government would finally agree that an anti-racism 
.campaign was necessary after all, only to launch it the same day as 
the tax package, guaranteeing it would slip into obscurity. As I have 
said before, words are important, and publicity is important when you 
are dealing with issues of community attitudes.

  

 I 
am genuinely sensitive to the argument that it does not help to have 
Governments ramming messages down people’s throats. It can be counterproductive. 
But it is surely not counter-productive for a Government to say “We 
think it important to put on the public record that we oppose racism 
in all its forms, and this is why we are funding a campaign to that 
effect. We don’t want the Commonwealth coat-of-arms on advertisements 
— what we want is to enable people to take action in their communities, 
in their own way.”

  

 Many 
of you will have already met my new Shadow Minister for Immigration, 
Con Sciacca, and I know many of you will meet him in due course, but 
let me say this about him: Con knows a lot about being a good Minister, 
a lot about representing a constituency, a huge amount about public 
advocacy, and in particular, lots about running effective community 
campaigns.

  

 Last 
time I addressed you here, I spoke of the ‘Australia Remembers’ 
campaign commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the end of World War 
Two as an excellent example of a grassroots community campaign, led 
by Government. Con is the man who ran that campaign as Minister for 
Veterans’ Affairs.

  

 You 
and I will have in Con a man ideally suited to keeping the Government 
up to the mark on its anti-racism campaign, and on its policies for 
ethnic communities generally. As a first-generation migrant himself, 
I think he is ideally suited to the job.

  

 Another 
area Labor will retain emphasis on is encouraging migrants to become 
Australian citizens. We do this because we believe an essential part 
of making migrants feel at home in their adopted country is the explicit 
exchange of rights and responsibilities that goes with taking out Australian 
citizenship.

  

 This 
is why we re-affirm our pre-election commitment to move the Office of 
Multicultural Affairs back into the Prime Minister’s Department where 
it belongs, and to re-name it the Office of Citizenship and Multicultural 
Affairs to emphasise the importance we place on citizenship, and the 
integral role the concept of multiculturalism will have in shaping Australian 
citizenship in our society.

  

 As 
part of our belief in citizenship, we also re-affirm our commitment 
to those things we believe migrants have a right to expect from their 
new home: the opportunity to find a secure job, decent housing, health 
care, education for their children, and culturally relevant settlement 
services.

  

 I 
think we all had a win of sorts in defending those rights when the Government 
announced its changes to the disastrous Job Network immediately before 
the election. Included in those changes was access to the Job Network 
for those migrants who had been denied assistance under this Government’s 
2 year waiting period for social security. This was an issue I raised 
in my last address to you in March, and which Martin Ferguson pushed 
particularly strongly. I am pleased to see that your activism before 
and since then has paid off, at least in part.

  

 Since 
I last spoke to you, I have also moved to put on the political agenda 
the issue of a proper population policy for Australia. I did this before 
the election campaign, because I believed it was important to have foreshadowed 
it as an issue, and not to spring it after the election was over.

  

 I 
said in my speech to the Global Foundation in August that as long as 
the immigration debate is just that — a debate about the annual immigration 
intake -we are unable as a nation to put immigration into its proper 
perspective against the background of the age structure of the population, 
our carrying capacity environmentally, the regional distribution of 
our population, our national security needs and our long-term economic 
dynamism.

  

 I 
also stated in that speech my belief that a proper population debate 
is in fact a series of different ‘migration’ debates — in particular, 
the question of how we ‘migrate’ our unemployed back into work, 
how we ‘migrate’ our young people into a future of better life opportunities 
through education and training, and so on. I make this connection with 
the world of work not to suggest that immigration causes unemployment 
— the weight of evidence shows it does not -but to recognise the self-evident 
difficulties of building popular support for higher immigration with 
the labour market in the state it is in.

  

  This is why my colleague Martin Ferguson has retained responsibility 
for population policy to go with his employment portfolio. As I said 
in my population speech, we take the view that there is no population 
debate without including a broader human capita l debate, and 
we intend to erect the first by resurrecting the second.

  

 Yesterday 
I was in Tasmania — the most habitable part of Australia environmentally, 
and one of the nicest places to live, yet a State with a huge drain 
of young people heading for the mainland (or the Northern Island, as 
they say) to look for work.

  

 Everywhere 
there was the demand that Australia put a population policy on the national 
agenda. Many in the community argued that without a combination of migration 
and developmental policies, there would be no chance to restore substantial 
economic growth, and with it a future for young Tasmanians.

  

 Perhaps 
the Government could similarly find some time to look at longer-range 
realities: today, there is one Australian of retirement age for about 
every 5 Australians of working age. Assuming current levels of net migration 
continue in the future, in the year 2021 there will be one for about 
every 3 ½. By 2051, the ratio will be one for every 2 ½.

  

 I 
cite these statistics not as an invitation to panic, but to illustrate 
why we must begin to engage with the issue of Australia’s longer-term 
population, rather than scratching around for statistical counter-arguments, 
which has been the Government’s only response to my speech in August.

  

 I 
will not resile from talking about the potential benefits of immigration, 
in particular for our regional development priorities. It is true that 
the current historically modest immigration levels are pushing Sydney 
and Melbourne to the limits of their carrying capacities, yet this need 
not be a bar to immigration while so many regional areas (and entire 
States such as Tasmania) have development needs which a higher population 
would go a long way towards fulfilling.

  

 I 
believe Australia should take the outward-looking view: the view that 
says this country is the best place in the world to live, and to raise 
a family, and that we can attract the best and brightest to settle here 
and make their future. But this also means protecting what we value 
about our society — the fact that we offer a safe new home for people 
fleeing oppression and conflict overseas, and the ability of people 
coming to Australia to access a family reunion program for loved ones.

  

 It 
is in this context of how we construct and amend our immigration programme 
that I have an important announcement to make to you today.

  

 There 
are currently around 1700 East Timorese seeking asylum in Australia. 
The history of their case is doubtless as well known to you as it is 
to me. We are now obliged to re-appraise this case.

  

 The 
Government has to date taken the view that East Timorese have access 
to Portuguese citizenship, and should therefore seek asylum initially 
from Portugal before seeking protection from any third country. I don’t 
mock this view — it was ours in Government, and it continued to be 
ours until now.

  

 I 
believe however that the recent Federal Court judgment by Justice Finkelstein 
has definitively ruled a line under this approach, and obliges a different 
resolution of this issue. His Honour concluded that it could not be 
argued that Portugal would automatically provide the protection sought 
by the applicant, given the requirements of Portuguese laws on nationality. 
In light of the legal recognition now that these East Timorese seeking 
asylum do not have effective Portuguese nationality, Labor believes 
the Australian Government must now recognise that these people — who 
have now been in Australia in many cases for 10 years or more, with 
children who have been educated in Australian schools — want to make 
Australia their home.

  

 Henceforth, 
Labor will adopt the policy that the Federal Court decision be recognised 
and accepted, that the Government recognise these 1700 East Timorese 
as a special case, and expedite the process of handling each application 
individually, subject to the appropriate bona fides of each applicant 
being established. There is good reason to quarantine this case, and 
ensure no unintended consequences by creating loopholes, however we 
cannot persist with our previous attitude.

  

 We 
do this in recognition of the fact that we must always be flexible enough 
in crafting an immigration policy to take account of new developments, 
while being careful to maintain the integrity of the programme. We do 
so also to indicate our desire to cooperate with the Government in producing 
a resolution, finally, of a long-running issue.

  

 In 
conclusion, I think if we can take one positive from the last 2 ½ years, 
and the rise of One Nation, it is that ethnic communities have taken 
an influential role in the political debate, and have stuck up for their 
rights.

  

 I 
congratulate you on that effort.

  

 If 
I leave you with one message today, let it be this: this nation will 
only continue to weather the storm of intolerance if you maintain your 
energy and activism, and if our political system works to solve the 
insecurities which lead too many basically well-intentioned Australians 
to flirt with extreme solutions.

  

 Those 
insecurities go across the board — they go to issues like health care, 
education, and jobs. They go very clearly to the fairness of our taxation 
system, and to the way we care for our aged. We invite you to these 
debates, to continue the activism you have shown in the past, but most 
importantly we tell you that Labor has stood by you in the past, we 
stood by you when things got difficult, and we still stand by you now.

  

 Thank 
you, and my best wishes for a productive conference.
