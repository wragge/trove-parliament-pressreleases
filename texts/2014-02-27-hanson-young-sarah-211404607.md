 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Thursday, 27 February 2014   

 Morrison escapes scrutiny in the  Government’s cover-up inquiry   

 The terms of reference for an Immigration Department inquiry into an incident at  its own detention camp on Manus Island that left one young man dead have  failed to take the role of the Immigration Minister into account, the Australian  Greens have said.   

 "This review is entirely inadequate," the Greens' immigration spokesperson,  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 "Despite the Minister's promises to the Parliament and the Australian people that  the review will look specifically into his own conduct, it looks like this inquiry will  just be another whitewash from a Government in cover-up mode.   

 "A man has been killed and, rather than looking into what role the Government  and responsible Minister played in the event, this review will only skim the  surface.   

 "This was the government's chance to show that it actually cared about Reza  Berati and the other refugees in their care. The Government has instead chosen  to fail Reza for a second time.   

 “Preliminary reports from a PNG investigation are already emerging but the  Australian Government has been dragging its heels.   

 “With the inquiry not due to report until April, the Minister can’t use it as yet  another excuse for secrecy and must commit to keeping the Australian people  informed of new information regarding the Manus Island attack as it comes to  hand.”
