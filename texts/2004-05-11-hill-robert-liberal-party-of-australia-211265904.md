 ADF OPERATIONS - MORE MONEY TO GET THE JOB DONE   

 The  Howard  Government  has  committed  a  total  of  $313.9  million  in  2004-05  to   support Australian Defence Force operations around the globe.   

 Defence Minister Robert Hill said an extra $131.6 million over three years would be  committed  to  continue  Operation  Catalyst,  the  ADF’s  contribution  to  the   rehabilitation of Iraq beyond the planned hand over to the new Iraqi Government in 

 June.   This  will  enable  the  ADF’s  deployment  to  be  sustained  at  about  current   levels  until  at  least  June  next  year  and  brings  the  total  funding  provided  for   operations in Iraq to $776.3 million since 2002-03.  

 “We  are  playing  a  crucial  role  in  helping  to  get  Iraq  back  on  its  feet  -  providing   training for the new Iraqi defence forces, contributing to security and providing air  traffic control services at Baghdad Airport,” Senator Hill said.   

 “With  the  new  funding,  the  Government  has  ensured  that  the  ADF  will  have  the   resources needed to stay until the job is done.”   

 Senator  Hill  said  $20.1  million  would  be  provided  in  2004-05  and  2005-06  to   provide for a continued but reduced ADF presence in East Timor.   

 “The  Government  has  provided  for  a  continued  ADF  presence  in  East  Timor,”   Senator Hill said.   

 $22.2  million  is  also  allocated  in  2003-04  and  2004-05  to  Operation  Anode,  the   ADF’s contribution to the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands.  The  ADF support to police has been critical to improving law and order in the Solomons  and ending the threat of ongoing violence.  As the situation continues to improve,  the ADF presence in the Solomons will be reduced.   

 Senator Hill said $16 million had been provided in 2004-05 to continue Operation  Relex  II,  the  ADF’s  contribution  to  operations  to  deter  unauthorised  boat  arrivals   and strengthen Australia’s borders.  The new funding comes in addition to previous  funding of $17.8 million in last year’s budget, $27.8 million in 2002-03 and $18.7  million in 2001-02.  

 “Since  the  beginning  of  Operation  RELEX  there  has  been  a  significant  drop  in   unauthorised  arrivals  into  Australia,  demonstrating  the  success  of  the  Howard   Government’s overall border protection measures,” Senator Hill said.     

 “As  a  result,  the  number  of  ADF  personnel  deployed  on  border  protection  was   reduced  in  2003-04,  although  contingency  arrangements  remain  in  place  to   reinforce the assigned force elements should the level of threat increase again.”   

 Senator  Hill  said  the  range  of  ADF  operations  funded  in  the  2004-05  Budget   demonstrated the critical need to maintain a flexible, mobile and prepared defence  force capable of operating both close to home and further afield.

 “The  broad  range  of  missions  demonstrate  the  complexity  and  uncertainty  of  the   strategic environment in which we now live,” Senator Hill said. 

 “Defence  personnel  are  extremely  capable  and  well  equipped  not  only  to  support   operations in our immediate region, but also to deploy further afield to assist global  efforts to combat terrorism and defeat the spread of weapons of mass destruction.   

 “Our  2000  currently  deployed  personnel  consistently  punch  above  their  weight  in   operations around the world - making meaningful contributions in the war against  terrorism  to  the  stabilisation  and  rehabilitation  of  Iraq,  the  UN  mission  in  East   Timor,  the  regional  assistance  mission  to  the  Solomon  Islands  and  to  border   protection.”
