 The Hon SUSSAN LEY MP  Federal Member for Farrer  Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs

 MEDIA RELEASE  For immediate release 

 Labor’s policy sinks 

  “This latest illegal boat arrival off the coast of Western Australia demonstrates that Labor’s  changed asylum policy has left our borders porous and vulnerable,” said Shadow Minister for  Justice and Customs Sussan Ley. 

 The vessel containing 32 asylum seekers was intercepted near Barrow Island earlier today  after it was detected by air patrols and intercepted dangerously close to Australian shores by  the navy vessel HMAS Wollongong. 

  “The Rudd Government’s policy is a disaster,” Ms Ley said. 

 “It is obvious that the Labor policy is encouraging rapid resumption of people smuggling and  as we saw last week, this can have lethal consequences for the refugees and the Australian  Border Protection personnel who are responsible for intercepting them. 

 In response to this latest arrival today, Home Affairs Minister Bob Debus conceded there  would be many more boat arrivals due to “push factors” from conflict zones. 

 He again defended Labor’s changed policy, saying this was a “demonstration of the  effectiveness” of the border protection system. 

 “This boat brings the total of arrivals since August 2008 to 485,” Ms Ley said.    

 “Mr Debus is out of his depth. He has no clear answers or response to this problem.  Mr  Debus and Mr Rudd must realise the inadequacy of the support that they are currently giving  to Indonesia to stop this heinous practice.     

 “People smugglers have been given the green light to resume this callous practice by  Australia’s obviously inadequate policy.” 

 Ms Ley is calling on Mr Debus and Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to bite the bullet and sit down  with the Opposition to go through the intelligence and advice from the Australian Federal  Police and other government agencies so that an agreement can be made on setting a  border protection policy that allow us to have a humanitarian refugee policy whilst protecting  the integrity of our borders.
