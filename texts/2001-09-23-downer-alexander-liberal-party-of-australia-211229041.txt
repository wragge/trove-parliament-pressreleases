 HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH WEST ASIA

 I am pleased to announce that Australia will provide $14.3 million towards the delivery of humanitarian assistance to displaced and refugee populations in South West Asia.

 This is a clear demonstration of Australia's commitment to international agencies to support refugees, internally displaced people and other vulnerable groups, and is one element in the whole-of-government approach to combating illegal people movements.

 There are currently some 3.5 million Afghani refugees living in Iran and Pakistan and a further 950,000 people displaced within Afghanistan.

 In the past 12 months Australia has provided humanitarian assistance totaling $9.5 million for Afghanistan and for refugee programs in neighbouring countries. This assistance has been provided to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the International Organisation for Migration.

 Australia is also providing up to $300,000 to the Afghan Forum to be hosted by the Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva in early October. The Forum will bring together Afghan Support Group Countries, including Australia, and the two countries of first asylum for Afghani refugees, Pakistan and Iran. The aim of the Forum is to mobilise support and increased funding for developing more enduring solutions for displaced Afghanis and explore appropriate international responses.

 This additional funding will enable Australia to work closely with agencies including UNHCR, OCHA and the International Committee of the Red Cross and assist in forging a cooperative approach to this international humanitarian issue.
