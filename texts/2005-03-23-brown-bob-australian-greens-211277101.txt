 Bob Brown, Senator for Tasmania   

 Vanstone’s ‘No Hope’ Visa 

 23rd Mar 05 

 Greens Senator Bob Brown has condemned immigration Minister  Amanda Vanstone’s announcement as heartless.    

 “The new ‘removal pending bridging visa’ will leave those released  in a cruel limbo,” Senator Brown said.    

 “To be let out from behind the razor wire, yet to be told that any  day you could be sent back overseas, is heartless.   

 ”These are men, women and children who have demonstrated their  eagerness to become Australians, have been locked up for years,  and when finally released Amanda Vanstone offers them a ‘no hope  of staying in Australia’ visa.    

 “Furthermore Amanda Vanstone’s plans announced today do  nothing for those whose asylum seeker claims are still pending.   Hundreds of men, women and children who have been locked up  for years, who have committed no crime and who may be genuine 

 refugees, will remain behind razor wire.    

 “Asylum seekers will have had to abandon all legal claims to stay in  Australia before they can get this new visa that offers them no hope  of permanent security,” Senator Brown said.    

 Senator Brown repeated his call for the immediate return to  mainland Australia of those detainees locked up on Nauru and  Christmas Island.
