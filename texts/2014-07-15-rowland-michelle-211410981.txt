 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Labor opposes family visa changes   

 Labor has voiced its grave concern about the Abbott Government’s move to close  the door on low and middle-income earners ever bringing their parents to  Australia    

 Today, the Government has confirmed it will push ahead with its agenda to  punish ethnic communities by voting down Labor’s disallowance motion.   

 In doing so the Government has closed the door on the chances of many people  ever bringing their parents to Australia by abolishing the Non-contributory Parent  visa and Other Family visa category.   

 Under the Abbott Government’s cruel cuts to family visas, tens of thousands of  families will now have to pay up to a reported $125,000 if they ever want to be  reunited with family members.   

 Today the Abbott Government has callously closed the door on family visas,  abandoning ethnic families and communities across Australia.   

 This is a cruel move by a Government that is completely out of touch with  migrant communities.
