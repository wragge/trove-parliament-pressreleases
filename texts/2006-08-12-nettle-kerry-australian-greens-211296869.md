 Senator Nettle, 12th August 2006   

 Greens Senator Kerry Nettle was today endorsed as the top of the ticket candidate for  The Greens Senate ticket for the next federal election.    

 Senator Nettle won over 80% of the first preferences from the statewide ballot of  Greens members in NSW.    

 "It's a fantastic result which leaves me both humbled and enthused. The party are  raring to go in a big 12 months which we hope will see more state representatives  elected in March and a successful Senate campaign later in the year.    

 "The Greens around the country are on a mission to rescue the Senate from majority  control.    

 "Restoring the benefits of a balanced Senate is essential for the democratic health of  this nation.    

 "Kim Beazley will not be able to get rid of the IR laws is the Coalition still control the  Senate - The Greens are needed.    

 "The inhumane refugee laws will not be changed if the Coalition still control the  Senate after the next election.    

 "A strong vote for the third force in Australian politics The Greens is what's needed to  rescue the Senate. That is what I am looking forward to being a part of in the coming  campaign."
