  NEW MANUAL GUIDES DOCTORS IN HELPING THE VICTIMS 
OF TORTURE

  

  Federal Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Michael Wooldridge, 
tonight  launched a new manual which aims to improve doctors’ 
ability to provide appropriate care and counselling to refugees and 
their families, many of whom may suffer physical and emotional scars 
as a result of torture inflicted in their previous home country.

  

 Developed by the Victorian Foundation for the Survivors 
of Torture and the Western Melbourne Division of General Practice, the 
manual provides information and clinical advice which will establish 
‘best practice’ health care for refugee patients, including those 
from the former Yugoslavia, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and 
other areas of regional conflict.

  

 Since the Second World War Australia has welcomed 
some 600,000 people as refugees. The Foundation for the Survivors of 
Torture estimates that as many as 150,000 people — or one in every 
four refugees - has suffered from torture.

  

 Launching the manual at a function at Footscray Town 
Hall in Melbourne, Dr Wooldridge said he believed the production of 
such a valuable resource was a sign of our community’s compassion 
and our continuing commitment to offer a safe haven to refugees.

  

 “I say that because recently, the voices of a strident 
few and in particular the views of   Pauline Hanson’s One Nation Party  have come to the fore in 
Australia of late,” Dr Wooldridge said.

  

 “Those views have reached new depths with the recently 
launched immigration policy in which the spurious claim is made that 
Australia’s refugee policies should be changed and that, at best, 
Australia should only be a temporary haven for refugees before they 
are sent back again when ‘things get better’.

  

 “Those views are deeply flawed. Indeed, creating 
uncertainty and insecurity as these views undoubtedly do simply add 
to the harm that torturers have done.

  

 “The views of One Nation on refugees in particular 
and immigration in general are views I not only reject but I want to 
make clear tonight they are views that will never be Government policy 
and they are views that the overwhelming majority of Australians repudiate 
and reject.

  

 “Think, for instance, how much the richer Australia 
is for having Gus Nossal. A world-class microbiologist, Gus came to 
Australia in 1939, at the age of seven, leaving behind his native Austria 
and the oppression of Nazism to come here.

  

 "The ludicrous logic of One Nation's policies 
would be that Gus should now be sent back.

  

 “Australia must and will remain true to its traditions 
of welcoming people who have fled to this country fearing persecution 
in their original homeland.

  

 “We must not and will not turn our backs on those 
who come here for refuge.

  

 “To do so would be to betray our moral obligation 
as a community and to betray that great Australian tradition of helping 
out those in need.

  

 “It would also mean turning our back on the best 
of our own history and overlook the wonderful contribution migrants 
have made to the development of this country.

  

 “In 1945, when the US and Britain, were turning 
away Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, it was Australia, that then 
offered those people a home.

  

 “In the 1970s, Australia welcomed proportionately 
more people from war torn Vietnam and from the killing fields of Cambodia 
than any other country in the world.

  

 “We did it because it was the Australian thing to 
do: to stand by people when they were down and needed a hand and to 
help out your neighbour when in need,” he said.

  

  Dr Wooldridge said the manual would restore hope since it was based 
on the conviction that with skilled help the harm from torture could 
be overcome and he survivors of torture would be able to enjoy healthy 
li ves as full members of the community.

  

 “Healing is a slow but sure process, and I’d like 
to congratulate and thank all those who put this manual together especially 
those who work at the Victorian Foundation of the Survivors of Torture 
and the doctors of the Western Division of General Practice who have 
taken the lead in preparing it,” Dr Wooldridge said.

  

  Dr Wooldridge also presented certificates to two local Western Suburbs 
doctors, who between them have given 80 years of service to the community.

  

  “Dr Igor Balaban who has worked for around 40 years in St Albans 
and Dr Zigoid Kortus, a GP for around 40 ye ars in Sunshine, represent 
between them a lifetime of service to the community,” he said.
