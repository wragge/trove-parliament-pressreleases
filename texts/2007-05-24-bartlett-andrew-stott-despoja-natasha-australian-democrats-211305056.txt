 WAKE UP CALL ON HUMAN RIGHTS  The Amnesty International Report 2007 should serve as a wake up call to the Howard Government on human rights, according to the Australian Democrats.  "The fact that other countries in the world are far worse on human rights issues - for example the Mugabe regime - must not give Australia an excuse to ignore our own failings," Democrats' Immigration and Indigenous Affairs Spokesperson Senator Andrew Bartlett said.  "The report's findings in relation to refugees and Indigenous Australians are accurate - Australia is clearly breaching human rights in these areas."   Democrats' Attorney-General's and Status of Women Spokesperson Senator Natasha Stott Despoja said she was very concerned about findings regarding violence against women and the threat posed by new anti-terrorism laws.  â€œAmnesty's report highlights the urgent need for the Australian Government to do more to address violence against women," Senator Stott Despoja said.   "Australia's anti-terrorism versus human rights record, exposed by the report, is disturbing - as is Australia's support for the US Military Commission process, something I have been consistently outspoken about.  "Since 2001, there have been more than 40 pieces of security and counter terrorism legislation which have increased surveillance and stripped away personal freedoms. In the same time there has been minimal activity in the area of human rights protection: the Government continues to reject calls for a Bill of Rights.  "The Security Legislation Review Committee highlighted some of the more pressing deficiencies in our 2002 anti-terrorism laws including the lack of independent judicial oversight in some areas. It is time for the Government to seriously examine how effective some of its more recent anti-terrorism measures have been," Senator Stott Despoja said.
