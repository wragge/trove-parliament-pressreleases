 Scott Morrison, MP 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   

 Rudd's Christmas Island revolving door as another boat arrives 

 Thursday 4th February 2010 

 The interception of yet another illegal boat, the tenth this year, shows Christmas Island has 

 become a revolving door under the Rudd Government’s failed border protection policies, 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today. 

 

 “Barely a day after 89 asylum seekers were flown to the Australian mainland in a futile effort 

 to reduce overcrowding on Christmas Island, another 89 asylum seekers plus three crew are 

 on the way to take their place,” Mr Morrison said. 

 

 “Seventy eight boats have now arrived since the Rudd Government started weakening the 

 border protection regime they inherited from the Coalition Government, with 10 arriving this 

 year alone with 602 people on board,” he said. 

 

 “It is also outrageous the government chose to release this information minutes after 

 parliament rose today in a pathetic bid to avoid accountability for their border protection 

 failures. The government is clearly sensitive to their failures in this area, it’s about time they 

 faced up to them. 

 

 “Christmas Island has become a visa factory under this government, with people smugglers 

 dictating who arrives in this country while profiting from their miserable and dangerous trade. 

 As soon as asylum seekers are transferred off the island the Rudd Government’s policies 

 have ensured that there more to come and take their place. 

 

 “The Rudd Government’s answer to their failed border protection polices is to buy more beds 

 and tents on Christmas Island and transfer asylum seekers whose claims have not been 

 settled to the mainland. This is far from the tough decisions needed to stop the boats. 

 

 “The arrival comes as it was revealed in parliament that the Rudd Government’s budget for 

 offshore processing on Christmas Island has blown out by $132 million. 

 

 “In the May budget the Rudd Government had allocated $125 million for offshore processing. 

 However additional estimates figures reveal the government is now asking for another $132 

 million for this work, an increase of more than 100%. 

 

 “The Coalition will not compromise our policy of offshore detention and would seek 

 alternatives in Government if required. While Manus Island and Nauru are now closed and 

 not under consideration, it is the Government’s job to find alternative solutions. 

 

 “Only strong and determined action can bring the boats to a halt and restore the public’s 

 confidence in the strength of our border protection system,” Mr Morrison said.
