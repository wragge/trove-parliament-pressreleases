 MEDIA RELEASE   

 TONY BURKE MP  Member for Watson  Shadow Minister for Immigration  29 July 2005 

 

 

 TONY BURKE WELCOMES THE RELEASE OF  CHILDREN FROM DETENTION   

 

 Shadow Minister for Immigration, Tony Burke today welcomed the long awaited release  of children from detention.   

 Mr Burke said that while Labor clearly maintains deep-seated objection to the Howard  Government’s mismanagement of immigration, it is important to acknowledge when the  Government takes a step in the right direction.   

 “Labor has long called for the release of children from detention and this call has also  been made by the minor parties and a number of Liberal backbenchers,” said Mr Burke.   

 “Everybody should be pleased that the Government will today meet the deadline it set  and release all children from detention centres.   

 “Innocent children should never again grow up locked up.      

 “Everybody involved should be pleased that children will now be treated with a greater  level of decency.”
