 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling OVER 42,000 PEOPLE HAVE ARRIVED BY  BOAT UNDER LABOR’S FAILED BORDER  PROTECTION POLICIES May 27, 2013

 This latest boat arrival, carrying 126 passengers, is the 40th boat to arrive already this month, Acting Shadow Minister for  Immigration and Citizenship and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

 “Under  Labor’s failed border protection policies over 42,000 people have arrived illegally on Australia’s shores on 694  boats,” Mr Keenan said.

 “That is more than four times the amount of people that arrived by boat in the entire 12 years of the Howard Government.

 “Labor has made our borders such an easy target that people from as far away as Africa are now coming via Indonesia to  Australia by boat courtesy of people smugglers.

 “The sheer volume of boat arrivals continues to break all existing records as Labor has employed policies that make our  country a magnet to people from all over the world.

 “Under this Government there is no border protection system and until there is a change of government the boats will  continue to come,” Mr Keenan said.
