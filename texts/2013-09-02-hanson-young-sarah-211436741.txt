 OFFICE OF SENATOR SARAH HANSON-YOUNG  AUSTRALIAN GREENS SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Monday, 2 September 2013   

 Greens will move for review of search  and rescue protocols after election   

 The Australian Greens have announced that they will move to initiate a review of the  Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s search and rescue protocols after the upcoming  Federal Election, following reports that distress calls from a refugee boat were ignored.   

 “Reports that pleas for help were dismissed need to be taken seriously,” the Greens’  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Time and time again we hear similar reports of confusion and delay in response to  distress calls from refugee boats.   

 “There needs to be a rigorous and independent review of AMSA’s search and rescue  protocols to see what more could be done to save lives at sea.   

 “More needs to be done to support our rescue personnel and to ensure that every  possible effort is undertaken when distress calls are made to AMSA.   

 “Too many people have lost their lives while trying to reach safety in Australia. We must  improve our search and rescue capacity while also offering people a safer pathway to  protection by increasing our humanitarian intake if we are serious about saving lives at  sea while caring for refugees.   

 “Tony Abbott has said he will cut the humanitarian intake which will force more refugees  onto boats, putting further lives at risk.”
