 KEVIN RUDD M.P. Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs

 MEDIA RELEASE

 HOWARD GOVERNMENT STILL DRAGGING ITS FEET ON HUMANITARIAN AID FOR AFGHANISTAN

 The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kevin Rudd, today reiterated Labor’s call for the  Howard  Government  to  accelerate  the  allocation  of  Australian  aid  to  humanitarian relief programs in Afghanistan.

 “Earlier  this  week  the  United  Nations  issued  an  impassioned  plea  calling  on  the international  community  to  accelerate  the  provision  of  humanitarian  aid  and  other assistance to Afghanistan”, Mr Rudd said.

 “So far less than 10 percent of the estimated US$100 million required to re-establish an effective  government  in  Afghanistan  has  been  forthcoming  from  the  international community.”

 “As  my  discussions  with  the  United  Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees,  Rudd Lubbers, on Monday confirmed, the maintenance of security, acceleration of de-mining efforts  and  effective  implementation  of  economic  reconstruction  are  all  vital  for  the successful repatriation of Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran.”

 “Notwithstanding  the  UN’s  pleas  and  the  grim  realities  of  the  Afghan  winter,  a substantial proportion of Australia’s assistance to Afghanistan remains unallocated more than three months after it was announced by Foreign Minister Downer.”

 “As of the end of December, the Howard Government had failed to allocate $10 million of the $23.3 million committed in October to humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan.”

 “Yesterday,  in  its  response  to  my  discussions  with  the  UNHCR,  the  Government demonstrated  no  sense  of  urgency  in  the  allocation  of  the  remaining  aid,  nor  any inclination  to  consider  further  assistance,  especially  in  priority  areas  including  de-mining.”

 “At a time when the Howard Government is spending many millions of dollars on the implementation  of  their  so-called  ‘Pacific  Solution’,  they  show  a  rather  less  than adequate understanding of what the international community, including Australia, must do to deal with the refugee problem at its source.”

 “It  is  most  unfortunate  that  Foreign  Minister  Downer appears  determined  to  finish  his holidays  before  he  turns  his  mind  to  any  further  commitment  to  assist  urgent humanitarian relief efforts in Afghanistan.  Once again, he is simply missing in action.”

 UN Says Kabul Needs Foreign Aid Now

 Mark Landler, New York Times Service Tuesday, January 15, 2002

 KABUL  With Afghanistan's interim government unable to pay its workers and foreign aid only trickling into the country, the United Nations on Monday made an impassioned plea to foreign governments to increase their financial donations.

 A spokesman for the UN, Ahmad Fawzi, said Afghanistan needed $100 million within a few days to pay six months of back salaries, as well as the next six months of wages, to its 235,000 employees. So far, less than $10 million has been given.

 "The administration needs several million dollars tomorrow or there will be no country when the billions are ready," Mr. Fawzi said at briefing in the Afghan capital. "It is time for the international community to stop talking and start delivering help."

 Mr. Fawzi said the special envoy of the UN for Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, had written a letter in early January to governments around the world asking for more money.

 "It was an appeal, and we are in an emergency," Mr. Fawzi said.

 As part of the agreement reached in Bonn that created the interim administration, the participating countries agreed to set up a trust fund of $20 million to pay the government's start-up costs.

 Less than half that amount has been deposited into the fund, which is administered by the UN. And the costs have spiraled because of the steep decline in the value of the U.S. dollar in Afghanistan since the agreement was signed Dec. 5.  "What we did not anticipate was the dramatic fall of the dollar in Afghanistan, which I think was unprecedented," Mr. Fawzi said. "The sum we needed quadrupled."

 The international peacekeeping force here is also taking shape more slowly than expected. German troops began joint patrols with Afghan soldiers in Kabul on Monday. But the number of peacekeepers on the ground is only 1,100, out of a planned total of 4,500.

 A British Army spokesman, Major Guy Richardson, said the force would not reach full strength until mid-February, almost a month late. He did not say what was causing the delay.

 Afghanistan did win a promise of money from its neighbor, Pakistan, with whom it has had a thorny relationship, not least because Islamabad supported the Taliban regime.

 Pakistan said Monday it would donate $100 million to Afghanistan, which has been ravaged by 23 years of war. It made the commitment at a ceremony to mark the reopening of its embassy here in Kabul. The embassy had been closed since October, when the United States began bombing Afghanistan with the acquiescence of Pakistan.

 People here wondered how the Northern Alliance, which routed the Taliban, would treat the representatives of the Taliban's chief patron.
