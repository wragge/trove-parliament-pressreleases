 MEDIA RELEASE     

 Tuesday, 7 April 2015     

 Government must review asylum seeker case to prevent death in  immigration detention    

 The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection must direct his Department to review the case  of Iranian asylum seeker, Saeed Hassanloo, the Australian Greens have said today.    

 “It is simply horrifying that a young man is prepared to starve himself to death so that he doesn’t  have to spend another day in detention. This is a devastating indictment on the Governments  refugee policy and raises serious questions about how people are being treated in detention",  Greens immigration spokesperson, Senator Hanson-Young said.       

 “I welcome the news that Saeed has begun accepting food, but we must not forget why he was  driven to such lengths. This man chose to end his life in immigration detention rather than return to  his homeland.    

 “The Australian community are horrified that our Government is prepared to watch a man die whilst  in their care.      

 “Peter Dutton must act compassionately and request that his Department review Saeed’s case  immediately.    

 “This is cruelty for cruelty’s sake and we cannot let it continue.”
