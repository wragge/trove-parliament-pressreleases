  Media Release

  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

  TEMPORARY RELOCATION ARRANGEMENTS PAUSED

  

  This morning Australian time the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees, Madam Ogata, has called fo r a pause in the temporary 
relocation of displaced Kosovo Albanians.

  

 After initially requesting Australia’s involvement 
in international assistance measures, Madam Ogata has indicated a need 
to re-evaluate the humanitarian effort after arriving in the region.

  

 Australia will take heed of this call and hold all 
removal arrangements, but will maintain its readiness to participate 
in any international effort to relocate Kosovo Albanians.

  

 Department of Immigration staff will continue to the 
Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia to continue to finalise preparations.

  

 I would expect Australia would be in a position to 
move people within 48 hours of the lifting of such a pause.
