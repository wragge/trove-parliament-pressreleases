 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Thursday, 6 February 2014   

 Another lifeboat in Indonesia, another breach  of international law and human decency   

 The arrival of another Australian lifeboat on Indonesia’s shores is an indictment on the Abbott  Government’s extreme policies and proof that people are still fleeing from war and persecution  in any way that they can, the Australian Greens have said.   

 “When Scott Morrison says no boats are coming, it’s a lie,” the Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “Tony Abbott has told the Australian people that no boats are arriving, but we know that they  have come with men, women and children on board. Rather than giving vulnerable families  protection from war and torture, the Abbott Government is pushing them back out into the  open ocean time and time again.   

 “Reports that there were two 18-month-old babies on the boat that Australia sent back to  Indonesia are very concerning. It can never be safe to tow-back a boat with children on board.   

 “The Government must answer questions about their tow-back policy. Were these refugees  really held on an Australian boat for over a week, as reported?   

 “Australia should be giving refugees a safer way to reach protection, by leading a genuine  regional solution. Dramatically boosting processing capacity in the region and increasing  Australia’s resettlement numbers would help to give refugees in Indonesia a safer option than a  dangerous boat journey.”
