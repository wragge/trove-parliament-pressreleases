  MEDIA RELEASE

  

 Hon Warren Truss MP

 Minister for Community Services

  

 EMBARGO UNTIL 6AM, 26 FEBRUARY 1999

  

  FUNDING FOR PREVENTING CHILD ABUSE

  

 The Federal Government will provide more than $500,000 
in special funding for a series of projects to promote good parenting 
and prevent child abuse, the Minister for Community Services, Warren 
Truss, announced today.

  

 This funding is part of the Government’s commitment 
of $12 million over four years.

  

 Attending the National Council for the Prevention 
of Child Abuse in Hobart, Mr Truss said the 14 one-off projects will 
deal with a range of subjects which challenge Australian parents everyday.

  

 “The Federal Government believes it is important 
to help families cope with the pressures of today’s society,” Mr 
Truss said.

  

 “Strong families offer the most effective nurturing 
and support for family members of all ages — from young children to 
parents and grandparents and families are crucial to maintaining a strong, 
cohesive and compassionate society.

  

 “That’s why the Federal Government’s Strengthening 
Families Strategy emphasises the importance of preventing and overcoming 
family breakdown by assisting families to work through problems before 
they reach crisis point,” he said.

  

 The projects, which demonstrate innovation and best 
practice in child abuse prevention and parenting, were selected from 
149 applications from all States and Territories. These include:

  

 â¢ Community education programs;

 â¢ Parenting children with a disability;

 â¢ Parenting for diverse populations;

 â¢ Parenting in prison;

 â¢ Dealing with parenting issues in the face of domestic 
violence;

 â¢ Assessing foster care support systems; and

 â¢ Mentoring.

  

 “These projects are an important part of the government’s 
commitment to strengthen families by helping to prevent child abuse 
and promote good parenting,” Mr Truss said.

  PARENTING AND CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION PROJECTS

  

  1. Just Kids 

  

 The project is designed to raise awareness of child 
neglect in the Bundaberg region. Four project components are proposed, 
all dealing with the issues of child neglect, its impact and how to 
prevent it. These include:

  

  â¢  A community 
service announcement that identifies the issue of neglect to be broadcast 
on regional television;

  

  â¢  The 
production of a 'just kids card' with a focus on preventing child neglect 
that would be distributed around schools, hospitals, health centres 
etc;

  

  â¢  The 
production of a series of street dramas performed at shopping malls 
put on by the public schools; and

  

  â¢  A series 
of workshops for parents, teachers and family support workers dealing 
with issues such as child development, sexuality and protective behaviours.

  2. Personal Safety for Parents and Carers of Children with a Disability

  

 The project will provide 4 one-day workshops for small 
groups. NAPCAN will work closely with Intellectual Disability Services 
Council, the Crippled Children's Association and Disability in Action 
in identifying parents who would benefit from these training workshops. 
It is expected that this work will benefit parents and carers of children 
with a disability so that:

  

 â¢ Carers can learn to monitor their stress levels;

  

 â¢ Increase coping skills;

  

 â¢ Develop personal safety networks;

  

  â¢  Find 
ways to teach personal safety to their own children.

  3. Co parenting project - parent education for separation and divorce/joint 
parenting in action

  

 The project will involve the development of training 
courses that teach parents how to be co-operative and effective co-parents 
after marriage breakdown. The training provides an opportunity for the 
couple to renegotiate the marriage and restore the family to prevent 
children being abused and neglected.

 The project will take the form of a two-part program 
specifically targeted at pre-adolescent children and their caregivers 
who have witnessed or have been subjected to violence within the home. 
The group focus is on the impact of violence and the strategies for 
resolving trauma associated with it.

  5. Strengthening foster care families

  

 The project proposes to design and implement a comprehensive 
survey of a full range of agencies throughout Australia, both government 
and non-government, which provide foster care in order to obtain information 
on the mechanisms they provide to support carers. The overall objective 
of the project is to strengthen foster care families in Australia.

 The proposal extends an existing program aimed at 
increasing the self-esteem and parenting practices of Aboriginal parents. 
It aims at increasing young mothers' active involvement within the community 
and improving personal relationships. The project recognises and acknowledges 
the importance of traditional parenting practices and aims to combine 
these with modern non-Aboriginal methods.

  8. Mates Program

  

 The proposal is for a mentoring program to support 
and preserve single parent families living in the north and north-eastern 
part of Tasmania who are experiencing problems due to the emotional 
and developmental needs of young sons not being adequately met. The 
proposal is to provide positive male role models from the community, 
especially for young boys between ages 6-14 years who come from single 
parent families with no male role model.

  9.  Parenting 
and play on the inside: enhancing the nurturance of children living 
in the prison environment

  

  Crossroads propose to apply a successful program called the Playlink 
Scheme to women in prison. It will offer women in prison who have an 
accompanying child aged 0-5 a parenting program aimed at enhancing self-esteem 
and parent-child bonding and  caring through practical support 
and a weekly interactive program.

  10.  Parenting 
between two cultures - a program for parents from linguistically diverse 
communities

  

 The project will provide for the development of a 
parenting program for use by bilingual community educators of Chinese, 
Croatian and Vietnamese communities. The program will be able to be 
utilised by schools, health centres, community organisations. It is 
expected that the program will help reduce child abuse and neglect in 
migrant communities by devising a flexible bi-lingual parenting package 
that can be used by, three migrant communities and adapted to the needs 
of others. It will provide organisations dealing with child abuse a 
valuable resource for use with clients from linguistically diverse communities.

  11. Parenting for Refugee Families

  

 The project aims to establish a model for assisting 
refugee parents to develop parenting roles and increase their parenting 
skills where war and torture has dislocated the family. The Department 
of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has established an Integrated 
Humanitarian Settlement Strategy and as a result of this strategy a 
number of services in Darwin have been established. Through these services 
two particular issues with incoming refugees have emerged:

  

  â¢ Single  
parent families from Africa where the father is the surviving parent 
but who has had limited opportunity to learn domestic skills; and

 â¢ Families 
coming from Yugoslavia who have been separated with the father imprisoned 
in a concentration camp.

  

  The project seeks to address the above problems of traumatised refugee 
families requiring  help. A pilot program will be developed to 
work with parents within refugee families, to support and assist parents 
in their parenting roles, taking into account their reactions to trauma 
and the culturally unfamiliar environment in which they find themselves.

  12. Darling Downs Early Intervention Program The Darling Downs Early 

  

 Intervention Program will look at the development 
of a service partnership between rural and welfare workers and child 
protection workers at the Fatima Family Centre. The strategies for this 
project will be developed with the participating rural worker through 
action research. These strategies would include developing:

  

 â¢ an assessment process when working with at risk 
families;

 â¢ support and education strategies for parents;

  â¢  conducting 
assessments, case planning, case review etc with each worker,

 â¢ an 
early intervention workshop with the project participants; and

 â¢ a 
report documenting outcomes of the project for families and workers 
to enable a submission to be developed for a rural partnership model 
of early intervention.

  13.  Before 
It Is Too Late

  

 The project is designed to support parents in their 
parenting role and increase community awareness about the impact of 
child abuse and neglect. A number of activities are proposed to meet 
this objective including:

  

  â¢  the 
development of an information resource kit for the prevention of child 
abuse for community service providers, parents and guardians including 
a directory of community support agencies;

 â¢ the 
planning and the facilitation of training programs for parents and community 
based service providers;

 â¢ the 
identification of gaps in support provision for families through the 
development of a service map and report detailing service gaps and possible 
alternative service solutions, both existing and required.
