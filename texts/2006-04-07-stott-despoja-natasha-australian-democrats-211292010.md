 INDONESIA: CRITICS NOT ENEMIES   

 Australian Democratsâ€™ Senator Natasha Stott Despoja has expressed disappointment at being  named an "enemy" of Indonesia.    

 "I firmly believe in the vital importance of a strong relationship between Australia and Indonesia, both  for bilateral purposes and for the region.   

 "However, it is important that democracy allows us to voice our concerns regarding human rights,  especially in our own region.   

 "I have also been critical of our own country in relation to human rights breaches and discrimination,  for example against Indigenous Australians and asylum seekers.   

 "It is unhelpful when we are regarded as enemies for our concern over the plight of Indigenous West  Papuans and our support for the full implementation of special autonomy. I encourage the return to a  process to which Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has previously demonstrated a  commitment.  

 

 "It is not in the interest of the people of Indonesia and Australia for officials to hide the true nature of  the human rights situation in Papua. It is only through honest and open dialogue that we will find a  workable solution to the end of violence in Papua. 

 

 "Sovereignty entails a responsibility to be open to discussion on these issues and to engage in  addressing them constructively," Senator Stott Despoja said.   

 Senator Stott Despoja has visited Indonesia previously, as a member of the Joint Standing  Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and as an election observer in 2004.
