 The Australian Greens   

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Wednesday, 17 June 2015   

 

 Love Makes a Way... To Parliament     

 The Australian Greens have expressed their full support for the peaceful action staged today at  Parliament House by Love Makes a Way, a movement of leaders of faith who are seeking to end  Australia's inhumane asylum seeker policies.    

 "This action today, expressed through prayer and song, intends to send a direct message to Australian  politicians: the Australian Parliament should act to release children and their families from detention,"  Greens Immigration Spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young said today.    

 "The actions of these Australians should be commended. No child should be in detention and it's time  they were released.    

 "Australia’s current refugee policies are utterly devoid of compassion, underhanded and must end.    

 "This action demonstrates how the Australian community feel about the Government’s approach to  some of the most vulnerable people, particularly children. They need our help, not our condemnation or  cruelty.     

 It’s time to listen to these voices.”
