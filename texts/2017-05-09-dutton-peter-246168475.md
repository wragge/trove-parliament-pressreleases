  MEDIA RELEASE 

  2017 BUDGET- IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION 

  The Turnbull Government has committed $95.4 million in the 2017-18 Budget to support  new technologies for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) to  bolster the prosperity of the nation and to protect Australia into the future. 

  In a world of mass mobility, Australia needs to modernise its visa processes to facilitate  economic growth and strengthen intelligence measures at the border to counter security  threats. 

  This work has begun with the abolition of the 457 visa programme and strengthening  the requirements to attain Australian citizenship. 

  This Budget provides $59.9 million over four years to enhance biometric storage and  processing capabilities to contribute to a safer border and a safer Australia. 

  Australia is committed to being a world leader in innovative border measures to protect  our community and facilitate trade and travel. 

  This funding will enable high volume biometric matching, storing, analysis and data  sharing of facial image and fingerprint biometrics through the introduction of new  technology. 

  The improved capability will allow more efficient detection of individuals of a security,  law enforcement or immigration interest while simultaneously speeding up the flow of  legitimate travellers. 

  This builds on the $99.2 million allocated in last year's Budget for a Visa Risk  Assessment capability to enable risks to be considered at visa application before an  individual reaches Australia. 

  Implementation of the upgraded biometric capabilities will commence from 1 July 2017. 

  Increased use of automation and technology is vital to facilitate rising numbers of  travellers. Each week the Australian Border Force (ABF) processes more than 700,000

  people arriving in or departing from Australia and this number is expected to increase by  about 20 per cent over the next few years. 

  To deal with the increasing number of movements the Government will initiate a long­ term programme of work to enhance the visa system. 

  The Government will provide $35.4 million over the forward estimates for DIBP to  engage with the market to explore new technologies to help design and build a visa  processing platform that will better manage risk, increase efficiency in processing and  improve the visa applicant experience. As an interim step, the market will also be used  to outsource client enquiry services, bringing onshore work that is currently delivered  overseas. 

  The 2017-18 Budget also brings into effect the Coalition's election commitment to  introduce a new temporary sponsored parent visa, which provides for a stay of up to five  years in Australia. 

  Australia's permanent migration programme for 2017-18 will remain at a ceiling of  190,000 places. 

  Regional Cooperation Arrangements to combat people smuggling and irregular  migration will be allocated $52.6 million for the International Organization for Migration's  work in Indonesia. 

  In line with the Coalition's commitment to increase the number of refugees resettled  under the Humanitarian Programme in 2017-18 there will be 16,250 places in the  programme, 2500 more than this year's intake. 

  Included in the increase to the Humanitarian Programme this Budget sees the  implementation of Australia's commitment made at the Leaders' Summit on Refugees in  New York last September to expand the Community Support Programme for sponsored  refugee resettlement to 1000 places.
