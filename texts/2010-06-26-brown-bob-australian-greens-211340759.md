 "The Green vote "parked" with Australia's first female Prime Minister Julia Gillard, won't stay there long," 

 Australian Greens Leader Bob Brown said today. 

 

 Commenting on the polls, Senator Brown said that the Gillard prime ministry will shed progressive voters 

 as the natural mood of celebration passes and the reality of Labor's right-wing ascendency manifests itself 

 in: 

 â¢ A backdown to the mining billionaires over the $12 billion allocated from 

 the mining boom tax in the budget forward estimates.  

 "That will be a multibillion dollar loss other Australians will suffer", Senator Brown said. 

 â¢ A continued harsh line on asylum seekers, as flagged in Ms Gillard's first 

 speech as Prime Minister. 

 â¢ Environmental failure: on whaling, biodiversity and marine reserves. 

 â¢ A tough time for Greens negotiators wanting better funding for mental and 

 dental healthcare. 

 â¢ More uranium mining and a Northern Territory nuclear waste dump. 

 "And I don't expect this Prime Minister to back the Greens' policy for a national integrity commissioner to 

 fight political corruption, or for our proposed commissioner for truth in political advertising. 

 

 "I do look forward to talking to Prime Minister Gillard about a carbon price and real action to tackle climate 

 change but I doubt that she will shake off the powerful coal mining lobby to achieve that goal," Senator 

 Brown said.
