 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling AFP struggling under Labor’s  mismanagement June 07, 2012

 The Australian Federal Police are clearly showing signs of strain due to the massive resourcing and staffing cuts Labor  have made to Australia’s premier law enforcement agency, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection,  Michael Keenan said today.

 “These massive budgetary and staff cuts have culminated with the statement made today by the AFP Commissioner Tony  Negus that the AFP did not have enough evidence to detain alleged people smuggler “Captain Emad” before he fled  Australia,” Mr Keenan said.

 “Unfortunately this Labor Government have slashed the AFP’s budget by $264.5 million since coming to office and  continue to cut personnel, despite their growing workload.

 “People smuggling investigations are extremely resource intensive, it is no wonder the AFP were unable to collect enough  evidence against this particular people smuggler, as they are inundated with the sheer volume of people smuggling cases  since Labor opened the floodgates for illegal boat arrivals,” he said.

 “Labor have made it near to impossible for the AFP to do their job adequately, the AFP is essentially working with one  hand tied behind it’s back.

 “If the AFP had the resources they needed to conduct comprehensive people smuggling investigations and collect the  evidence they needed, this alleged people-smuggler may not have been allowed to flee,” he said.

 “With every day that goes past and with every illegal boat that arrives, the people smugglers are further emboldened  under this soft-touch Labor Government and Australia’s border protection regime becomes the laughing stock of the  region,” Mr Keenan said.
