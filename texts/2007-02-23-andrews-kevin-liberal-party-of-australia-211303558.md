  Subjects: UPDATE ON UNAUTHORISED BOAT ARRIVALS  E&OE.. . 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  Ladies and Gentlemen, can I provide you with some update in relation to the situation of the  85 people who were rescued from a vessel in the Indian Ocean. They are cuirently on board  HMAS Success, the reports are that they are in good condition, they've been given food and  water, obviously, they have cover, there is sufficient provisions on HMAS Success to ensure  that they are adequately cared for in that regard. In the meantime, preliminaiy questions are  still being asked of them as to where they came from and what their intentions are in this  regard and that's going on as I'm speaking at the present time. 

  QUESTION: 

  (Inaudible) 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  The Jiidicaiioil is, accor.iilg to tii& &iiii 83 oft'ileiii say tliat tiiey ai-e i"i-oiii Sri iaiika  2 have indicated that they are from Indonesia. That's the info~nation we have in the present  time. 

  QUESTION 

  (Inaudible) the two from Indonesia were asylum seekers or people smugglers? 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  I don't know at this stage. All I can says is that this was not a vessel undeiTaking what one  may regard as a legitimate commercial activity. The indication is that they were seeking to  travel to Christmas Island and the nature of the vessel, as I said, didn't indicated that they  were out fishing in the Indian Ocean. 

  QUESTION: 

  What kind of vessel was it? 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  It was a technical, as I’m advised, wooden hulled fishing vessel that is often found in parts of  Asia. 

  QUESTION: 

  And you said this morning on the radio that the engine had been sabotaged, I was wondering  how they had done that? 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  The information I have is that when the HMAS Success came upon the vessel, at that stage  the vessel wasn’t operating, that crew from the Success went onto the vessel and repaired the  engine. As the vessel then proceeded to sail away from HMAS Success the crew, on HMAS  Success, subsequently observed that the vessel had once again stopped moving. They again 

  approached the vessel and at that stage they found that more damage had been done to the  engine or engines of the vessel and there was also further damage which had been made to the  hull of the vessel. As a result of that the Success crew foiined the opinion that this vessel was  unseaworthy and as a result of that they invited the occupants of that vessel to board the 

  Success. 

  QUESTION: 

  (Inaudible) 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  I can’t, I don’t know that. I’m reporting the advice that I’ve been told and that’s the advice  that I have. I’m told that the vessel is unseaworthy.. . 

  QUESTION: 

  Was it taking on water? 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  I believe it was taking on some water but I can’t tell you what the rate that that was. 

  QUESTION: 

  (Inaudible) 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  No, there was no attempt to turn this vessel back. Since this vessel had first been spotted by  an Orion aircraft, when the interception occurred Success went to the vessel to basically find  out what was happening. It observed then that the vessel appeared to be disabled, as I said,  crew went on, some repairs were attempted to repair the engine or engines on the vessel and it 

  2 

  appeared to move away again under its own repulsion and it was observed to stop and a  further inspection was done and that revealed further damage to the vessel. And it was at that  stage a judgement was made that this vessel was unseaworthy and the people were invited  upon the navel vessel. 

  QUESTION: 

  {Inaudible) 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  Certainly, this is an exainple of where we have actually spotted a vessel. Where an  interception has taken place in intemational waters and we have rescued people who may  otherwise have been in danger of drowning had their unseaworthy vessel sunk. 

  QUESTION: 

  Tony Burke, the iinmlgation spokesperson for the Labor party, called on you to explain the  delays in telling the public of what was going on (inaudible). 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  Well we spotted the vessel on, I think, on the 19“’. The interception occurred, as 1 recall, on  the 20th, it was then, in what I’ve explained in teiins of what’s occurred so far as boarding the  vessel, seeking to (inaudible) the vessel in international waters, and then ultimately rescuing  the participants on the vessel. I think we’ve carried out our obligations as we should. 

  QUESTION: 

  {Iiiaudible) 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  Well it was in the media prior to yesterday, so.. . 

  {Inaudible) 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  Well we’ve been seeking information ourselves, and we’re still seeking information from the  people concerned and we’ve done it in an entirely appropriate manner and will continue to do  so. 

  QUESTION: 

  Kevin Rudd today said that Labor (inaudible) processing on Christmas Island and then send  them back to where they came from. What do you make of that? 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  3 

  Well, we are obtaining infomation from these people. When we have further information  then we’ll be in a position to make a decision. And we’re doing this in an entirely appropriate  way. We’ve ensured the safety of the people concerned. We’ve now got to determine what to  do with this vessel, there’s a question of whether it can be towed somewhere, but if it’s  unseaworthy that may not be possible. We obviously can’t leave it sitting out in shipping  lanes out in the middle of the Indian Ocean; we’ll have to make a decision about that. 

  QUESTION: 

  { Inaudi b 1 e) 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  Look I ani not in a position to answer that at this stage. We’re still seeking information; we’re  only now getting preliininaiy infoiination. When we get more infomation we will make a  decision but we won’t make a decision until we’re in possession of the facts about the case.  And, people can talk about hurrying it up; we’re going to do it properly. 

  QUESTION : 

  {Inaudible) 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  Well, we want to know who they are, where they’ve come from, what they’re intentions are,  all of these things have to be sorted out. Ultimately there’s a question of undertaking  appropriate health checks. We did do some preliminary checks but I understand there is not a  doctor on the HMAS Success so obviously there’s some health checks that need to be  undertaken, but this will all be done in good time. But can I remind you, they are now safely 

  on an Australian navel vessel, they could well have been bobbing around in the middle of the  Indian Ocean on an unseaworthy vessel that could’ve ended up sinking. 

  QUESTION: 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  There no indication that I have of that. We’re just going through the normal processes in a  noma1 way and it’s a11 following in a way in which one would expect it to. 

  QUESTION: 

  {Inaudible) 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  No, there’s no indication of any, there’s no untoward delay at this stage and we will continue  to process this matter and when we’re in, in possession of sufficient information we’ll be able  to make a decision as to what we do next.

  QUESTION: 

   ina audible) 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  Obviously no formal claims have been made for asylum because they’re on the navel vessel.  There is some indication, I’m advised, that there’s been some suggestion that some of the  people are seeking asylum but that sort of information we’re obviously seeking to find. 

  QUESTION: 

  How long will they remain on the Success? 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  It’s not going to be forever, obviously, because the Success has got other work to do. It  obviously got adequate supplies but it’s not our aim to keep them on the Success in the middle  of the Indian Ocean for longer than is necessaiy. But as I said, we’ve got to look at how we  deploy Success and one of the issue here is what do we do with a disabled vessel, whether or  not it is possible to tow it, or whether or not we’ll have to sink the vessel in order to make 

  sure that it is not a danger to other shipping in the area. 

  QUESTION: 

  {Inaudible) 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  The Success sought to intercept the boat to find out what was going on as a result of the  reports that came tlirough fi-om the Orion aircrafi in the first place. 

  QUEST I ON : 

  { inaudibie) 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  Well obviously Christmas Island is an option. Naui-u is obviously another option but we’re  just looking at it at the present time. But can I reiterate what the Prime Minister said, we, it is  our intention that they do not come to mainland Australia for a number of reasons. One is that  we do not want to encourage this sort of behaviour of people being put on unseaworthy 

  vessels out in the middle of the Indian Ocean, as a tragedy that could come from that. I think  it would be irresponsible to be sending a boatload of people on a sinal1 vessel which has  proven one way or the other to be unseaworthy out in the middle of the ocean and we  specifically do not want to encourage that sort of activity. 

  QUESTION: 

  Do you think they came from Indonesia? 

  5 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  Look, that’s matter’s being sought, information is being sought about at the present time. A11  I can say to you is that what claims made of the people concerned is that 83 of them are Sri  Lankan and 2 are Indonesian. 

  QUESTION : 

  {Inaudible) 

  ~ I N I S T E R  ANDREWS: 

  That’s a matter that we’re getting ahead of ourselves at this stage. 

  QUESTION : 

  (Inaudible) 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  Well, the first thing is to determine the investigation where (inaudible) at the present time, the  second thing is then to work out where to take thein and that will determine the, and answer  the question you’ve asked. I can’t answer that at this stage. 

  QUESTION: 

  (Inaudible) 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  No, all I’m told is that they’re all inale and they’re all adults. 

  QUESTION: 

  When will the health checks be (inaudible)‘! 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  Well the detailed health checks can’t be completed until they’re taken somewhere more  permanently, obviously, than HMAS Success and whether that’s Christmas Island or  somewhere else then obviously detailed health checks can be undertaken. 

  QUESTION: 

   ina audible) 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  Well I understand that obviously ion a vessel like the Success there are people who have a  variety of expertise and knowledge and experience when it comes to health matters. That’s 

  6 

  part of standard navel training and they may not have a doctor but of course you’ve got people  who have a degree of competency on this sort of vessel. 

  QUESTION: 

  (Inaudible) 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  No not at all. In fact this shows that the system that we’ve got in place is working. We  spotted this vessel, we have made contact with this vessel, we have sought to put it in sea  worthy order, when that failed we rescued the people on that vessel and now we are going  through the further procedures in order to deteiinine their future. 

  QUESTION: 

  {Inaudible) 

  MINISTER ANDREWS: 

  This is Australian Government policy in practice. Thank you very much.
