 TRANSCRIPT

 Doorstop Interview

 10.30am, 9 August 2002

 Subject:  China gas contract /Miriuwung-Gajerrong/Refugee Review Tribunal………………………………………………………………………e&oe

 ATTORNEY:

 Let me start by saying that I think the decision by the Chinese Government to select Australia LNG as its preferred supply is a fantastic result for Western Australia.  It also demonstrates the wisdom of Commonwealth and State Governments working together for a common goal. It worked very well in this instance.  The representations were made by successive State Government and by the Commonwealth Government to Chinese officials with one objective and that objective has been achieved.  The result as I said is a fantastic one for Western Australia.

 Now, there are two sets of decisions from the High Court about which I’d like to briefly comment.  First, there is the decision in two migration cases where the decisions of the Refugee Tribunal set aside and secondly there are two native title decisions, which are also of some significance.

 In respect to the migration decisions it is important to bear in mind that the decisions made by the High Court were of a technical nature relating to process.  The outcome of the decision was not that the unsuccessful applicants before the Refugee Review Tribunal were in fact refugees.  The decision was that the matter go back to the Tribunal for further hearing because of the procedural unfairness in the process before the Tribunal.  And the other important thing to mention is that it’s not necessarily the case that there are thousands of cases hanging on this.  The only cases to which it would be relevant are those in which their appeals are already being pursued.  In this case the High Court had to make factual findings in respect of the two applicants in order to reach a decision on the law.

 REPORTER:

 How many other cases does this decision affect?

 ATTORNEY:

 Well, we don’t know at this time whether it’s going to affect any.  It’s quite possible that there will be other cases in which the same process has been followed and the same procedural defects have occurred but at this time it’s not possible to say and I don’t propose to speculate.

 REPORTER:

 Would that mean that every decision that the Refugee Review Tribunal has made now needs to be re-examined?

 ATTORNEY:

 No, it doesn’t because the defects that the High Court found in the process were, first, that adverse information had not been put to the applicants for comment and, secondly, the Court was unable to find on evidence that the members of the Tribunal who made the decisions had taken into account information that was required to be considered. Now, that may not apply in other cases but may apply in some.  But decisions on procedural fairness are part and parcel of the tribunal system.  It’s not uncommon for a decision of the tribunal to be set aside on these sorts of grounds.

 REPORTER:

 But it doesn’t cast the tribunal in a very good light does it?

 ATTORNEY:

 No, the Refugee Review Tribunal does a good job in disposing of large numbers of cases. There are not that many decisions that the Tribunal that have set aside but decisions of tribunals are some times set aside as is the case in these two cases.

 REPORTER:

 How would you describe the manner in which this procedural unfairness has manifested itself?  I mean, the problem here was with documents that were lodged electronically.  I mean, it seems an embarrassing situation (inaudible).

 ATTORNEY:

 Well, I think the High Court had difficulty in reaching conclusions on what the Migration Act required in that process.  I think this is a matter that will be considered by the Government with a view to determining whether there is a need for review. But it was simply a question of whether the tribunal member had taken into account information that was available and which to some extent the Act required to be considered.

 REPORTER:

 Will there be changes as a result of this?

 ATTORNEY:

 Well, at this time it’s not possible to say that there will be changes.  Certainly the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs will examine the judgments to determine whether there is a need for change, but there is no clear cut case for change that been identified at this point.

 REPORTER:

 There have been called for an inquiry into the review. Is that being considered?

 ATTORNEY:

 The department will examine the judgment and the Minister will take appropriate steps in due course.

 REPORTER:

 But it could entail some kind of review of the Tribunal?

 ATTORNEY:

 I think that all that is likely to happen as a consequence of these two decisions is that the decisions themselves will be examined closely and a determination will be made whether as a result of the deficiencies revealed there is a need for any change.  It is wrong to suggest that the whole system was criticised.   It was just in these two cases particular issues arose as to the way the process was followed.  The High Court did not sit in judgment on the whole system.

 Another thing that I think should be put to rest is that these two cases have absolutely nothing to do with the Tampa legislation. The Tampa legislation deals with offshore processing. These cases involve on-shore processing.

 REPORTER:

 But I mean it has been suggested that as a result of this decision the system could become very overloaded if all these cases may potentially need to be re-examined.

 ATTORNEY:

 Well, that is not evident at this time.  The Department will examine the judgment to see whether there are any wider implications.  At this time it’s not evident that there are.  These are two cases which were determined on their facts and because of the nature of the process before the High Court the High Court actually had to engage in fact finding, something it doesn’t normally do.

 REPORTER:

 Has this Miriuwung-Gajerrong decision provided any further certainty for native title in this country?

 ATTORNEY:

 I think one of the benefits of the Miriuwung-Gajerrong case is it has provided certainties to some principles.  It’s been settled, for example, that there can be a partial extinguishment of native title.  There have been significant determinations in relation to the effect of pastoral leases and mining leases in the particular circumstances.  The benefit of certainty is that those involved in the native title process, the indigenous claimants, the respondents whom may be Governments, Commonwealth, State or Territory or those in the pastoral or the mining or the

 tourism industry, they will all have a much better idea now of the principles that will apply to their particular circumstances.

 REPORTER:

 What about Carmen Lawrence’s call that the entire native title legislation needs to be reviewed for clarity’s sake?

 ATTORNEY:

 Well, I reject that entirely.  There is no case made out for a wholesale review of the native title system.  The Native Title Act was introduced in 1993. As a result of deficiencies revealed between then and in particular as a result of the Wik decision, amendments were made in 1998.  As a result of those amendments we have seen the system working much better than it previously had.  What we are seeing is a number of consent determinations of native title being made and we’re seeing quite a number of indigenous land use agreements being made or in the process of being negotiated.  This has had a beneficial effect in enabling those who are affected by a native title claim to resolve differences and reach agreement.

 REPORTER:

 There’s still an awful lot of grey areas.  Were you disappointed that the High Court referred a lot of matters back to the Federal Court yesterday?

 ATTORNEY:

 Well, I think that was a consequence of some changes in legislation that occurred between the time that the claim was made and the decision in the High Court was brought down.  It’s also not an uncommon feature of a High Court decision where they are considering the principles applied by a lower court that the matter is sent back to that court for further fact finding on the basis of the principles settled by the High Court.  It’s really a normal process.

 REPORTER:

 Were there any clear winners yesterday? Who came out best?

 ATTORNEY:

 Well, I think its clear from the judgment that the High Court did not consider that there were any winners.  The High Court made a decision that each party should bear their own costs on the basis that each party had been partially successful and partially unsuccessful.  So I don’t think there are any individual winners.  I think those involved in the system are all winners because of the certainty that the decision has brought.

 The Western Land Division case also has brought some certainty to an area where there has been uncertainty.  This is the case of Wilson and Anderson in relation to pastoral leases in the Western Division of New South Wales.  That has settled an issue and people can now deal with native title claims and claims for compensation on the basis of a clear decision of the High Court.

 REPORTER:

 But for pastoral leases in Western Australia, is it the same implication?

 ATTORNEY:

 The pastoral leases in Western Australia are different to the pastoral leases in New South Wales but the Miriuwung-Gajerrong case has made determinations in relation to pastoral leases and native title claims in Western Australia.

 REPORTER:

 I wanted to ask regarding the decision in the High Court about the Refugee Review Tribunal, that could effect up to 7000 cases. Will it be reviewed on a case by case basis or will there been some way of filtering out cases that need further examinations?

 ATTORNEY:

 Well, I already answered that before you got here.  I think its important to bear in mind that these two decisions are decisions on their facts.  There is no guarantee that any other cases are going to have identical fact-findings in relation to them and have the same result.  What the Government proposes to do is to study the judgments and the implications of them and to determine whether there are in fact any other cases.  To jump to the conclusion that there are thousands of cases in a similar position I think is quite wrong.  It’s important also to note that the Court did not make a finding that the two applicants were refugees.  What they decided was simply that they had not been procedural fairness applicable in that hearing before the Review Tribunal and on that basis it should be sent back for a re-hearing.  That re-hearing may or may not determine that the applicants are refugees.  They may get exactly the same result.

 Thank you. Ends…
