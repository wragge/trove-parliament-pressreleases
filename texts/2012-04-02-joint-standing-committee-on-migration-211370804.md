 Committee to visit refugee program at Adelaide secondary college   

 The Joint Standing Committee on Migration will be in Adelaide on Monday, 2 April as part of  their ongoing inquiry into multiculturalism in Australia. The visit will include visiting Thebarton  Senior College and a public hearing at the University of Adelaide with leading migration  researcher Professor Graeme Hugo.    

 Committee Chair Maria Vamvakinou said she is keen to see how Thebarton Senior College’s new  arrivals program for migrant and refugee students is progressing.    

 “One of the current themes of the inquiry has been the provision of services for young migrant  and refugee students to better participate in Australian society and overcome initial settlement  barriers. The committee is keen to hear how the new arrivals program helps assists young  migrant and refugee students to complete their South Australian Certificate of Education and  settle into their local community,” she said.    

 The committee will also be hearing from Professor Graeme Hugo, Director of the Australian  Population and Migration Research Centre at the University of Adelaide. Professor Hugo is one of  Australia’s leading researchers on migration in Australia and was recently commissioned by the  federal government to report on the contribution of first and second generation humanitarian  entrants to Australian society.    

 “I am very pleased to have Professor Hugo appear before the committee,” Ms Vamvakinou said.  “His extensive research experience on social and economic migration trends and attitudes in  Australia will provide some valuable insight into the committee’s inquiry and the importance of  research for well-informed policy. We will use this opportunity to hear about some of the current  research capabilities on migration and ways of improving qualitative and quantitative research.”    

 Following the visit of Thebarton Secondary College, the Committee’s public hearing will  commence at 11:45 am in the Basten Room, Mitchell Building, University of Adelaide.
