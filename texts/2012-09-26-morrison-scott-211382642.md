 Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison 

 101 boats in 100 days 

 26/09/12 

 101 boats have illegally arrived in the last 100 days under Labor’s failed border protection  policies, after the arrival of two more today with a total of 53 people on board, Shadow  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice,  Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today. 

 “Julia Gillard and Minister Bowen today mark yet another shameful milestone in their long list  of border protection failures, with 101 boats illegally entering Australia in the last 100 days,  carrying a total of more than 6,400 people,” Mr Morrison said. 

 “Every new day under this Labor Government brings yet another boat and a bigger burden of  cost and chaos saddled upon Australian taxpayers. Just this week the Government had to  reveal another $208 million in cost blowouts on last year’s arrivals,” he said. 

 “In 2011/12, 112 boats illegally entered Australia. The annual bill for managing asylum  seekers in 2011/12 was $1.37 billion. That’s more than $12 million a boat, and we’ve had  more than 100 in the last 100 days. 

 “Having to be dragged kicking and screaming to introduce half measures on our borders,  Labor continues to refuse to restore the full suite of Howard Government policies that  stopped the boats. 

 “Labor’s half hearted solution on border protection is a continued recipe for further cost,  chaos and tragedy. 

 “Half hearted measures and ongoing denial won’t stop the mounting economic costs of  Labor’s failure. Wayne Swan’s budget has already blown, with more people arriving in less  than a quarter of this financial year than what he budgeted would arrive during the entire  year. 

 “Further inaction will result in more taxpayer money being thrown at border protection budget  blow outs which have already reached over $4.9 billion over the last four years,” Mr Morrison  said. 

 Mr Keenan said: ““The arrival of two boats near Cocos (Keeling) Islands today carrying at  total of 53 people indicates that the people smugglers are simply not taking the Gillard Labor  Government seriously. 

 “This rolling crisis is a long way from being solved, given there have been 94 more boats and  over 6,000 more people arriving to our shores compared with the total for 2011, and we are  only in September. 

 “This month alone there have been 28 boats carrying over 1,700 people - this should send a  message to the Government that they need to get serious and implement the Coalition’s full  suite of border protection measures to stem this constant flow of boats, which has been on  average just over one per day. 

 “Our frontline service men and women of Customs Border Protection Command are being  asked yet again to do more with less - this rate of arrivals is simply not sustainable and will  put further strain on our already overstretched border protection forces,” Mr Keenan said.
