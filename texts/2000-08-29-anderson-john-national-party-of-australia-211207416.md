 LABOR’S ANTICS ON REFUGEES TO BE CONDEMNED

 The Australian public would be disgusted by Labor’s parliamentary performance today where ALP MPs continuously disrupted the Minister for Immigration as he explained why illegal entrants seeking residence in Australia as refugees would not be released from detention at Woomera without proper checks on their criminal records or security screening.

 The Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, John Anderson, said it was outrageous for the ALP to suggest that the Federal Government was not taking a comprehensive and humane approach to a difficult issue.

 Mr Anderson said the interjections and disruption left the clear impression that the Labor Party did not support the Government’s approach to people who enter Australia illegally.

 "Quite correctly, the Immigration Minister Mr Ruddock said that people could not be released from detention once they had been determined as refugees until all matters relating to security, character and health had been determined.

 "But this was not enough for the ALP MPs. Their interjections showed Labor’s hand - that refugee seekers who have not gone through the proper processes should be released into the community.

 "The disturbing events that have taken place at Woomera will be deplored by all Australians. The damage and physical threats to detention staff will not in any way help those seeking refugee status."
