 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Senator Sarah Hanson-Young   

 Sunday 9 June 2013   

 The Australian Greens today expressed sorrow at the loss of at least 13 lives at sea due to the sinking  of an asylum seeker vessel off Christmas Island.   

 “This is an awful tragedy and we express our condolences to all involved and to the families who  have lost loved ones,” the Australian Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said. 

 

 “The Australian Greens offer our full support to the Australian personnel conducting the search and  rescue efforts.   

 “As a nation we are indebted to the brave efforts of officers who have to respond to human  tragedies such as this and our thoughts are with them.    

 “I have been in contact with the Minister’s office on the sinking and have requested further briefings  as the search for survivors continues.   

 “This is another tragic moment as yet more men, women and children lose their lives in their search  for a new life, so we must redouble efforts to offer them safer pathways than dangerous vessels.
