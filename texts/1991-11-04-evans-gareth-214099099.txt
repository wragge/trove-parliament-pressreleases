 AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN RELATIONS TN THE WORLD OF THE 1QQOR

 Speech to the National Press Club by Senator Gareth Evans,  Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, following launch of  Evans and Grant, Australia's Foreign Relations: in the World  of the 199Qsr  Canberra, 4 November 1991 *  I

 It is not so many years ago that the expression "Australian  foreign policy" was almost a contradiction in terms. The  Second World War and its aftermath did see something of a  coming of age, with Evatt's role in the foundation of the  United Nations and the quickening of interest in South-East 

 Asia. But overall, it is hard to argue that anything much  more was involved than a turning from one great protector to 

 another.

 One of Bruce Grant's and my arguments, in our book published  today,  is that the final evolution of a genuinely independent  Australian foreign policy is a very recent phenomenon indeed.  We link it, in fact, with the publication of the 1987 Defence  White Paper which, in spelling out for the first time a 

 coherent and achievable policy of defence self-reliance,  liberated Australian foreign policy from the constraints under  which it had traditionally laboured.

 I cannot imagine that anyone is in doubt these days about the  importance of our having an independent Australian foreign  policy - one which is overwhelmingly shaped and governed by 

 what is directly in our own national interest, and not by what  may be necessary from time to time to get a foot inside a 

 protector's door. The extraordinary events of the last two 

 years have made it more important than ever that we refine and  develop an effective Australian foreign policy, with a clearly 

 developed sense of who we are, what we are capable of doing 

 and what we should be doing.

 The end of the Cold War, the collapse of communism everywhere 

 but in East Asia, the Gulf crisis and the resurgence with it 

 of a United Nations collective security role, the new 

 attention being devoted in international affairs to human  rights and the environment, the huge stakes that have now come 

 to be involved in international trade politics - all these  developments since 1989 have made it that much more apparent 

 that the world is being dramatically reshaped around us, and  that nations which are not quick on their feet in finding a  place in the new order are going to find themselves faltering  alarmingly, both politically and economically. It is a matter  of not only grasping new opportunities for the advancement of  national interests, but not being left behind in the rush. We 

 simply cannot afford to look upon foreign relations issues  like moo cows gazing at the passing traffic.

 Let me be a little more specific about some of the issues  where which we need to be intimately concerned.

 In global security terms, some giant strides have obviously  been taken towards peace and disarmament. But much remains to  be done. Even when all the commitments and proposals that  President Bush and Gorbachev have now respectively floated 

 have been implemented, there will still be some 30,000 nuclear  warheads left in the globe - and this in an environment where  no-one can be certain the Soviet Union will be immune from 

 conservative backlash; where there is a major danger of 

 proliferation still in at least three highly volatile areas of  the globe (the Middle East, South Asia and North-East Asia);  and where there is still a long way to go before we rid the 

 world of chemical and biological weapons and the will to use 

 them. It is difficult to argue that we have reached even the  beginning of the end of the nuclear era, or the era of weapons  of mass destruction.

 The security future of our own Asia Pacific region is, again, 

 as fluid, dynamic and uncertain as it has ever been. To the  extent that there has been, or is likely to be, with the

 3

 relaxation of the Cold War gridlock a diminution in the  influence of the two nuclear superpowers, this is likely to be  accompanied by a relative increase in the influence of the  region's other major powers (China, Japan and India) and a 

 significant enhancement of the military capability of a number 

 of lesser powers to match their rapidly rising economic 

 status. There is no shortage, moreover, of potential 

 flashpoints - not least the Korean Peninsula or the South 

 China Sea - that could generate real conflicts out of what at  the moment may seem fairly remote contingencies.

 Economically,  the prospects of the world and our region are 

 very finely balanced.  Unless the Uruguay Round succeeds - and  that is very far from being guaranteed at the moment - there  is a very real and immediate danger of countries moving to 

 solve their trade problems through unilateral measures,  discriminatory bilateral deals and inward-looking regional 

 arrangements.

 There is a particular danger that battle lines will be rapidly  drawn around three large, distinct trading blocs, built upon  the Yen, Dollar and Deutschmark respectively, with offensive  and defensive strategies being mounted that will make some of 

 the battles of recent years between Japan and the United 

 States over manufactures, or the United States and EC over  agricultural subsidies, pale by comparison. Some of the 

 biggest companies in the largest countries in the world are  presently positioning themselves in all three "blocs" to 

 minimise the impact on their profitability of such a 

 development if it occurs, but the developing countries and  smaller trading nations like Australia who want to sell into  all the markets of the world to stay afloat need to be acutely 

 conscious of just how sensitive the present situation is.

 In addition to the traditional preoccupations of politico-  strategic and trade diplomacy, a whole new set of issues has 

 come to occupy the international agenda, bringing with them 

 both new pressures for countries like ours to play an enhanced

 4

 role, and new opportunities to do so - issues like the 

 international environment, refugee flows, narcotics  trafficking, and human rights observance. Interdependence,  cooperative action and collective action have become the new  catch cries, and those countries less than actively involved 

 in the new "third agenda" diplomacy are not only not helping 

 their immediate neighbours, but not helping themselves.

 All this means that Australia's foreign policy should be the  subject of rather more intelligent debate and informed  discussion than tends to be the case at the moment, and it is  in order to generate, or at least to contribute to, such a  debate and discussion that the book launched today was  written. The tradition hitherto in Australia (although there 

 are of course plenty of honourable individual exceptions) is  that detailed attention is really only paid to foreign affairs  issues when they get caught up in domestic partisan politics,  or have some strong personality component, or have a full-  scale blood and thunder dimension.

 The Cambodian issue is a good case in point. While there has  been probably more Australian interest in this than just about  any other Asian regional issue, and a great many stories in  particular about the dangers of a Khmer Rouge resurgence,  detailed diplomatic reporting and analysis of the political 

 settlement process has been sketchy, and not a single 

 Australian newspaper ran a front page story on the final 

 signing of the settlement agreement in Paris two weeks ago. 

 By contrast, every quality European and North American paper I 

 saw the next day - and I checked eight of them - gave the 

 story prominent front page space. Because it didn't involve  a personality clash or, for a pleasant change, an attack by  the Opposition, or what could be described - or caricatured as 

 the case may be - as a row or a kowtow, and involved a 

 positive step forward rather than another descent into the 

 abyss of violence, it did not justify more than a minor inside  page run in any Australian paper, notwithstanding the central

 5

 role that this country had played in bringing the settlement 

 about.

 The story did get a much more substantial run a day or two 

 later with some drama about the possibility of Australian  peace-keeping soldiers being injured, and then with the  material generated by Stephen Solarz's announcement about the 

 Nobel nomination and Hun Sen's visit - about none of which  latter coverage I '  m complaining!  - but the nature of these  stories just reinforces my point.

 Another example of what I have in mind is the coverage of the  question of regional security dialogue, which - 

 notwithstanding some systematic and serious efforts by  Australia in a variety of forums to shape a new approach to  this issue - only became the subject of sustained attention in  the media with the story, based on a leaked exchange of 

 correspondence,  about an alleged row I had with James Baker on  the subject. This was far more fun to play with than any real 

 analysis of what Australia was proposing, or what its pros and  cons might be.

 I have to say that a secondary theme in this coverage, and it  has been all too common elsewhere, was the tendency to 

 undersell - indeed greet with destructive scepticism - the  contribution we were trying to make internationally. (Our 

 approach to this issue of regional security, incidentally, has 

 come over the last year to be so widely accepted that it is  now only no longer at all controversial, but has become almost  boringly commonplace!). It is difficult enough putting ideas 

 and principles into the international market-place without  having to fight a latter-day 'cultural cringe'  at home: that 

 sense almost of incredulity that anything Australia has done  could really make a difference.

 The truth of the matter of course is that foreign policy has 

 not been, since the end of the Vietnam War nearly two decades 

 ago, the stuff of which election victories have been made or

 6

 broken, or even on which leadership reputations have strongly 

 depended. Some anti-communist fixations apart, Malcolm  Fraser's foreign policy had more in common with Gough 

 Whitlam's than either would comfortably admit (at least before  Kerry Packer met Conrad Black!), and so far as the present 

 Opposition is concerned, I have had the impression that, with  only a handful of exceptions, the flurry of outraged press  releases periodically released on foreign policy issues have  been written with as little conviction and enthusiasm as they  have been received.

 In talking about encouraging debate on Australian foreign  policy, I am not referring to more of the same breathless  gossip that so often passes for political debate on domestic  issues. I am talking rather about more serious, considered  analyses of issues like regional security; the significance of  APEC and competing ideas about regional economic relations;  political and economic developments in the extraordinarily 

 rapidly developing countries of our immediate region; the arms  control and disarmament agenda; and ways of advancing human  rights issues in an Asia Pacific context.

 More generally, I would like to see a much better informed  understanding of the complexity of foreign relations issues, 

 the multiple constraints that exist in the real world of  multilateral forums and bilateral relationships, the way in  which we need to not only pursue what is in Australia's 

 national interest but to recognise what is within our capacity  to influence and what is not, and the priorities it is 

 sensible for a country like ours to set in mobilising those 

 scarce resources we have at our disposal.

 Analyses like these might not make for headlines or big by­ line exposure, but they would be performing a real service for  Australian decision-makers and publics who have too often in 

 recent years simply failed to fully appreciate what is going  on around us, how it impacts upon us and what we might be able 

 to do in response.

 7

 The book that Bruce Grant and I have written is designed to 

 open up all these issues in a systematic way - not from a 

 party political perspective but from an Australian 

 perspective. We cannot pretend to have had the last word on  any of the issues in question - not least because events  continue to move so quickly - but we hope that we may have  done something to put public discussion of them on a more  serious and substantial base than has been common in the past.

 There are two big themes in what we have written that go 

 beyond all the detail. One is that being of secondary size  does not mean being second-rate in international affairs, and  that we can as a middle power effectively deploy our resources  not only in a way that advances our own interests, but does 

 help at the same time to make the world a better and safer 

 place.

 The other theme is that Australia's future is essentially as  an Asia Pacific nation (with the emphasis no less on Asia than  on the Pacific); this is where we live, must survive 

 strategically and economically, and find a place and role if  we are to develop our full potential as a nation; and this is  where we can become effectively integrated without losing the 

 essential characteristics of our own national identity.

 Henry Kissinger apparently said at a gathering in Sydney 

 recently that "When I am shaving in the morning I am not  thinking about Australian foreign policy". Of course it is  the case that a geographically remote country of 17 million 

 people in a world of five and a half billion should not get  ideas above its station: that line appears as the second

 sentence of our book! But a middle power like Australian can  nonetheless do a great deal - using techniques of coalition  building and niche diplomacy, paying careful attention to 

 priorities and credibility maintenance, exercising intellectual creativity at the right times, and through sheer 

 persistence and stamina.

 8

 We have shown as much in recent years by, for example, our  successful initiatives with Cambodia, APEC and Antarctica, and 

 the roles we have played in the GATT Round through our 

 establishment of the Cairns Group and on apartheid through our 

 membership of the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers  on Southern Africa. (Not a bad return from the taxpayer's 

 dollar, incidentally, for a Department whose current annual  budget is less than the cost of the recent avionics update for 

 the F-lll.)

 All of these activities, and in particular our efforts with  Cambodia and APEC, led one senior South-East Asian diplomat to  refer recently to a "fresh breeze blowing from the South".   Again, French Foreign Minister Dumas referred in Paris two 

 weeks ago to Australia, with our Cambodia initiative, having  brought to bear, when hope was weakening, "a veritable second 

 wind" to the settlement process.  I am not sure that I am 

 entirely comfortable with these various "wind" metaphors, but  their use does I think demonstrate that Australian diplomacy  is now being taken very seriously around the world.

 There have been times in our history - and the diplomatic  historian W J Hudson refers to Billy Hughes in Versailles and 

 Dr Evatt in San Francisco in these terms - when "posture was 

 policy", and not inappropriately so in the sense that "if  Australia was to stay in from the margin of international  society, its natural place at that time, it had to make a  noise" (W J Hudson, Evatt at San Francisco,  Paper delivered at 

 ANU, 4 April 1991). Nowadays I think it fair to say that we  can afford to rely less on sheer noise, and more simply on our  record of effective performance, in making our continuing 

 contribution to world affairs.

 Australia’s need to more closely and comprehensively engage  with Asia is not only perhaps the most important, but also the 

 trickiest, of all our foreign relations tasks.  The changing  nature of our relationship with Asia is the most commonly

 9

 recurring theme in our book: there has been no greater turn­ around in contemporary Australian history than the 

 appreciation that this region from which we so long sought to  protect ourselves, whether by esoteric dictation tests to 

 exclude migrants, or high tariffs to protect our 

 manufacturers, or security alliances with the distant great  and powerful - is now the region which offers us the most.

 All this has involved a significant learning experience - on  both sides - and that is continuing. One of the things that I  think has been hardest for many Australians to learn - and I 

 do not exclude myself from this description - is that if we  are going to really succeed in comprehensively engaging  Australia with our Asian region, this is going to require some  moderation of our own instinctive behaviour, which is  characteristically direct, blunt and straight down to tin- 

 tacks.

 What is involved here is simply recognising the very different  cultural milieu that does by-and-large operate within Asia -  there are of course significant variations between the  different Asian cultures. The essential characteristic of  that milieu is that how something is done is as important, if  not more so, than what is done. I have described this on 

 various occasions as simply learning normal neighbourhood 

 habits of civility.

 The important thing is to be able to conduct relationships 

 this way, fully alert to local sensitivities, while at the  same time not conceding anything so far as our own 

 sensitivities are concerned. Australia's national values give  central weight and importance to democratic principles and to 

 fundamental human rights - not just economic, social and  cultural rights of an essentially collective character, but  individual civil and political rights as well. There is 

 absolutely no reason why in our regional dialogues we should 

 concede any ground in the advancement of those principles, but

 10

 every reason why we should do so in a way that is not likely 

 to be counter-productive.

 All of this subtlety, I have to say from hard experience, 

 tends to be a high risk activity so far as the Australian 

 media is concerned.  Carefully crafted nuances get lost in  transmission and drowned in a thunder of commentary: a dissociation becomes an apology, an explanation a grovel. The  Embassy case in Malaysia is fresh enough in everyone's memory,  

 not least mine, to serve as an example. Let me make my point  by recalling a conversation I had with two journalists who  shall remain nameless, shortly after the first "grovel-rash"  story appeared. I began by saying that most of the adverse  commentary in Australia seemed to have been premised on a  misleading report of my speech Kuala Lumpur: I had said there

 that a particular series of incidents had been "seen as  offensive, and on occasions downright insulting", but this had  been reported almost everywhere as me saying that those  incidents "were" offensive and insulting: in the process an  objective description of a reaction had become a value-laden 

 j udgment.

 My two friends from the media were quite unfazed by this  observation. Journalist A said, "Sorry - I can’t really see 

 the difference". Journalist B said, "Well - I accept that 

 there was a difference in what you said. But mate", he went  on, "you know as well as I do that these little words tend to  drop out of reports, and if they don't the subs are just as  likely to take them out anyway.  The colour words are 

 'offensive'  and 'insulting', and if you don't want them to be 

 reported, you shouldn't use them".

 So much, I guess, for subtlety and nuance in our relationships  with Asia. I and my colleagues will go on trying, but we 

 really do need your help.

 We need the help of those of you in the Press Gaillery in 

 reporting accurately, for better or worse, what we in

 11

 Government are doing and saying as we go about - hopefully 

 sensibly - trying to build effective partnerships with  governments and business, not only in Asia but all around the 

 globe. We need your help in informing yourselves more 

 systematically and comprehensively about what is happening in  our region, and the different currents that are shaping it.  We need your help in being careful to at least not 

 inadvertently generate havoc in relations with our more 

 sensitive neighbours: if you want to do that deliberately,  then of course that is your choice in a free society, and  governments will just have to cope with the consequences as 

 best we can.

 But above all we - not just the Government but the whole 

 Australian nation - needs your help in simply raising the  quality of debate on foreign policy issues: by giving higher  priority to news items that are not just the foreign relations  equivalent of local crash-and-bash stories, to trying to look 

 at issues rather than just the personalities and personal 

 clashes that may or may not be associated with them, and to  trying generally to develop a more systematic understanding in  our community of the extraordinary changes that are occurring 

 in our region and how we might as a nation benefit from them.

 You, the journalists, do have a particular responsibility in 

 setting the national public affairs agenda. If you believe  that issues stories are as important as personality stories, 

 then it's up to you as journalists to fight for the space in 

 your bulletins and papers - and to make those stories 

 attractive and readable to readers, listeners and editors.

 The conduct of Australia's foreign relations is perhaps more  than any other area of Government activity an on-going, non­

 static process. I hope that I have done my bit - by using all  the opportunities for understanding my current office has  given me - to get some information and ideas about our foreign 

 relations into the public domain. But if those ideas are to 

 be refined and developed, and to keep pace with events as they

 12

 unfold throughout the rest of the 1990s and beyond,   process is going to need a lot more contributors - from  media, from the universities, and from throughout  community - than has been the case so far.
