 Press Release Dated: 4 Jan 2001 Press Release Number: 01/02 Portfolio: Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

 Ruddock’s research welcomed: Democrats back alternatives to long-term detention of all boat arrivals: “HOMES NOT PRISON CAMPS” The Australian Democrats have welcomed moves by the Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock to explore alternatives to long-term mandatory detention.

 “A new approach is needed to deal with unauthorised arrivals,” said Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett.

 “The present system of mandatory detention is not working. It is expensive, inhumane and unnecessary.

 “With increasing numbers of families amongst the thousands of arrivals a year, several hundred children are locked away behind wire fences, often for long periods of time.

 “The Democrats would support amendments to the law to place women and children in group homes outside of detention centres. We would also like to see unescorted minors released into the care of church and welfare agencies in the community,” he said.

 “If we are going to build new facilities, they should be homes not prison camps.

 “The Democrats also believe there should be a six-month maximum for detention, except in exceptional circumstances. Six months is enough time to check that a person is not a health or security risk, even if their application for residency is still being considered.

 “If they are not found to be refugees they can still be deported, but Australia has a moral responsibility to provide haven for genuine refugees and not send people back to persecution or death,” he said.

 “People are spending too long in overcrowded detention centres while their status is assessed.

 “Church and welfare agencies who care for people when they are eventually released frequently report stories of trauma suffered

 whilst inside the centres.

 “Australia is one of the few countries in the world which compulsorily detains all unauthorised arrivals indefinitely. This policy was introduced by the ALP. The Democrats have been the only party in the Parliament calling for alternatives so we would welcome a Government change of heart and a change of policy,” Senator Bartlett said.

 “Children and families who have not been convicted of any crime should not be subject to automatic, indefinite detention. The Democrats have always said that there needs to be more flexibility in the system,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
