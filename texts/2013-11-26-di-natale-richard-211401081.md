 Abbott Government silences peak drug and  alcohol body   

 Australian Greens health spokesperson, Dr Richard Di Natale, said today that the  Abbott Government is defunding the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of  Australia (ADCA) in an attempt to stymie debate about illicit drug policy.    

 “The Abbott Government is determined to hide evidence, sideline experts and  silence advocates,” said Senator Di Natale, a former drug and alcohol clinician.   

 Established in 1966, the ADCA is a peak body that represents the alcohol and  other drugs sector and has a history of advocacy for a harm minimisation  approach to illicit drugs.   

 “First Tony Abbott closed the Climate Commission because it wants to hide the  truth about climate change. Then it refused to discuss matters relating to the  welfare of refugees and asylum seekers. Now it is defunding the Alcohol and  Other Drugs Council of Australia because it wants to stifle any debate about drug  law reform.   

 “When did it become acceptable for an Australian Government to simply silence  anyone is disagrees with?   

 “The Coalition is breaking another election promise by making cuts to the health  budget. Frighteningly, axing the ACDC could herald just the beginning of funding  cuts, with the sector losing its peak body and front line of defence.   

 “As a former drug and alcohol clinician, I know that Tony Abbott’s brutal and  secretive cuts are hurting some of the most vulnerable people in our community.”
