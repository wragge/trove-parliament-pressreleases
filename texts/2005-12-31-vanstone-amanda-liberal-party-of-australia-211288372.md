 Settlers Heading West in More Numbers

 Numerous migrants and refugee entrants have taken the James Reyne and James Blundell approach and headed way out west.

 More than 16 000 people arrived and settled in Western Australia in 2004-05, which is up on last year’s figure of 15 411.

 It is the largest number of migrant and refugee entrants under this Coalition Government. Although the United Kingdom and New Zealand  provided the most number of migrants and refugee entrants, a bulk of people from Singapore and South Africa also headed to Australia’s west  coast.

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said it was a 60 per cent increase on the 10 000  settlers that arrived in Western Australia in 1994-95.

 On the national front, more than 123 000 people arrived and settled in Australia in 2004-05, up 40 per cent annually on the 1994-95 figures.

 ‘Australia has a wonderfully rich and diverse society as a result, with nearly one in four of Australia’s 20 million people born overseas,’ Senator  Vanstone said.

 ‘On top of these figures are the growing numbers of people becoming permanent residents after arriving in Australia, such as overseas students  who apply for skilled migration onshore.

 ‘Our ongoing commitment to new and innovative visa programs and the increased efficiency and integrity of immigration processing means that  Australia continues to attract more and more people from around the globe.’
