 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling FIVE BOATS IN ONE DAY AND OVER 8,000  ARRIVALS SINCE ELECTION ANNOUNCED May 08, 2013

 The announcement of the illegal arrival of two more boats last Monday, with a total of over 170 people on board, meant that five boats turned up on just one day and brought to more than 8,000 the number of people who have illegally arrived on boats since Julia Gillard announced the election date, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “Five boats illegally arrived on Monday, as the record surge in arrivals continues under Labor’s border protection failure,”  Mr Morrison said.

 “More than 8,000 people have now illegally arrived by boat since Julia Gillard announced the September 14 election date in late January. Since then people smugglers have been making the most of every extra day of this Government’s failed  border policies to ply their trade and send record numbers of people here on dangerous boat journeys.

 “With children and families estimated to comprise 40% of those currently arriving on boats, the risk of more dying at sea under Labor’s failure is increasing.

 “A record 3,000 plus children have arrived so far in 2012/13, which is up 1,000 from 2011/12 and a further 1,000 from the year before.

 “The lure of Labor’s soft border protection policies has always been the reason for the arrival of boats in our waters. These arrivals have brought unprecedented cost, chaos and tragedy which will continue for at least as long as Labor remains in office,” Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “This has been the biggest start to any month for illegal boat arrivals - a record previously broken last  month.

 “There have been 14 boats, carrying 1,264 people, arriving in just the first 6 days of May - this problem is only continuing  to escalate under Labor’s failed border protection policies.

 “2012  was  the  largest  year  on  record  for  boat  arrivals  yet  this  time  last  year  there  had  been  33  boats  carrying  2,592 people - so far this year there have been 123 boats and 8,564 people.

 “Given there has been nearly four times the rate of boat arrivals it is clear that 2013 will be a profitable year for the people smugglers courtesy of the Labor Party,” Mr Keenan said.
