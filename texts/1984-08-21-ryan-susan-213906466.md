 THE BUDGET - GOOD NEWS FOR STUDENT ASSISTANCE

 21 August 1984

 Substantial improvements in student assistance schemes are provided for 

 in the Budget, according to the Minister for Education and Youth 

 Affairs Senator Susan Ryan.

 Senator Ryan said that, given the Budgetary restraints within which the 

 Government had been obliged to work, it was heartening that an 

 additional $63.5m had been made available for student assistance. This 

 meant that a number of desirable measures could proceed.

 There would be increases to allowances in all schemes,  most notably the 

 Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, the Secondary Allowances Scheme 

 and the Adult Secondary Education Scheme.

 Tertiary allowances would rise by 10 per cent, virtually closing the 

 "incentive gap" between TEAS and unemployment benefits for 16 and 

 17-year olds leaving school.

 Payments under the Secondary Allowances Scheme would be increased by 

 15 per cent and allowances under the Adult Secondary Education Scheme 

 will be realigned with TEAS.

 The level of living allowances for postgraduate and Aboriginal students 

 will be increased by 3.9 per cent.

 Child allowances under TEAS, ASEAS and postgraduate awards would be 

 increased to the level of the relevant social security rate.

 Income test levels generally would be increased by 10 per cent, a 

 significant benefit to about 7,000 students who otherwise would not 

 have been eligible to receive financial assistance.

 The income test level for benefits under the Assistance for Isolated 

 Children Scheme would be increased by 20 per cent.

 Student Assistance 2

 Senator Ryan said a major package of improvements to TEAS rules would 

 be implemented from the beginning of 1985. This was the outcome of a 

 review of anomalies and complexities in TEAS carried out over the last 

 year by the Department of Education and Youth Affairs. The principal 

 changes would be:

 .  Less restrictive procedures relating to the approval of 

 courses in universities, colleges of advanced education 

 and TAPE institutions.

 .  Previous study in TAPE courses of one year’s duration or 

 less, or previous study in courses discontinued more than 

 10 years ago, would no longer prejudice a student's 

 eligibility for TEAS.

 .  Academic assessment for TEAS would be simplified by 

 reducing the requirements relating to progress.

 Other changes would have a bearing on the granting of independent 

 status and the payment of fares allowance.

 These changes would affect above 2,000 students and will cost

 $2.7 million in 1984-85 and $5.3 million in a full year, Senator Ryan

 said.

 TERTIARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE SCHEME (TEAS)

 TEAS provides income-tested allowances for students studying 

 full-time in approved courses at universities,  colleges 

 of advanced education,  TAPE colleges and certain non­

 government institutions.

 TEAS has benefited in several ways under the 1984-85 Budget:

 .  significant increases in the major allowance rates

 .  realignment of the dependent child allowance with 

 the corresponding social security benefit

 .  a 10% increase in the income level that qualifies 

 for full benefits

 .  implementation of a package of measures to simplify 

 the scheme and remove anomalous restrictions on 

 eligibility.

 Living allowances under TEAS will be increased by 10% for 

 1985. The new rates for 1985 compared with the 1984 

 allowances are as follows:

 Type of Allowance 1984 1985

 at-home $2,llOpa ($40.36pw) $2,321pa ($44.51pw)

 away-from-home $3,255pa ($62.25pw)  $3,581pa ($68.67pw)

 independent $3,255pa ($62.25pw)  $3,581pa ($68.67pw)

 Îhe income test will also be liberalised for 1985 .  The level

 of family income at which maximum benefits will be paid  

 in 1985 - known as the marginal adjusted family income  

 or MAPI - will be increased by 10% from $12,983 to $14,281.

 Where the adjusted family income, that is gross parental  

 income in the previous financial year minus deductions  

 for other dependent children in the family and for deductions  

 allowable under Sections 51-54 of the Income Tax Assessment  

 Act, exceeds the marginal level, the allowance is reduced

 TEAS 2

 on a sliding scale. A partial allowance will be paid in 

 1985 where the adjusted family income does not exceed 

 $22,280 for an at-home allowance and $27,320 for an away- 

 from-home allowance.

 The following table gives an indication of allowance levels 

 which will apply in 1985 for various adjusted family income 

 levels:

 Adjusted Family  Income 1983/84

 Annual At-home Rate Annual Away-from- 

 home Rate

 ($) ($) ($)

 14,281 2,321.00 3,581.00

 17,500 1,518.50 2,778.50

 20,000 893.50 2,153.50

 22,280 323.50 1,583.50

 27,320 - 323.50

 There is a special concession in the means test where there  

 are two or more students in a family undertaking a full-time  

 tertiary course. Where there are two students in a family  

 studying away from home, for example, a partial allowance  

 will be paid in 1985 provided the adjusted family income  

 does not exceed $40,350.

 Where a student is married, the means test is applied to  

 the spouse's income in the previous financial year. The  

 maximum benefit will be paid in 1985 provided the spouse's  

 income does not exceed $14,281. This limit has also been  

 increased by 10% over the 1984 limit. Where the spouse's  

 income is between $14,281 and $20,844, a partial allowance  

 will be paid on a sliding scale.

 Other benefits provided under TEAS are an allowance of  

 $42.70 a week for a dependent spouse, $14 a week for each  

 dependent child (increased from $10 per week in 1984) and  

 an incidentals allowance of $100 if attending a university;  

 $70 if attending a college of advanced education; and $30  

 if attending a TAPE college.

 TEAS 3

 TEAS beneficiaries living away from home may also receive 

 a fares allowance entitling them to three return trips 

 a year between home and their educational institutions.

 Expenditure under TEAS for 1985 is expected to be about 

 $300 million compared with $242 million in 1984, an 

 increase of almost 24%. Some 109,500 students are expected 

 to be assisted under the scheme in 1985 compared with 

 100,000 in 1984.

 A PACKAGE OF MEASURES TO IMPROVE TEAS

 Following a major review by the Department of a number 

 of complexities and anomalies in TEAS, the Government has 

 accepted a package of measures to be implemented, as from 

 the beginning of 1985.

 The principal changes in scheme provisions will be:

 .  Simplified procedures relating to the approval of 

 courses in universities, colleges of advanced 

 education and TAFE institutions which will reduce 

 the number of courses currently the subject of 

 individual scrutiny prior to their being approved. 

 Combined courses at universities and colleges, for 

 example, will now receive automatic approval.

 .  Students who have completed a TAFE course of one year's 

 duration or less will now no longer be ineligible 

 on these grounds for further TEAS assistance if they 

 elect to attempt another study at that level.

 .  Previous study in a course discontinued before 

 completion more than 10 years ago will no longer 

 preclude students from eligibility for TEAS.

 TEAS 4

 .  Academic assessment rules for TEAS will be simplified

 by removing the requirement relating to overall progress. 

 However TEAS will continue to be available only for 

 the normal duration of the course (not counting repeat 

 years)  and students will be required to have passed 

 at least half the full-time work-load in the most 

 recent year of study. Two main effects of this change 

 will be to make it easier for first year students 

 (currently required to pass more than half the full-time 

 work-load)  to retain their entitlement to TEAS.

 Students transferring to another course will also 

 find it easier to retain benefits in the early part 

 of their course.

 .  Work undertaken while still at school will no longer 

 be taken into account in the assessment of claims 

 for independent status on the basis of two years' 

 full-time employment.

 .  De facto relationships will be recognised as grounds 

 for independent status where there is a child of the 

 relationship.

 These changes will affect 2,000 students and will cost 

 $2.7m in 1984-85 ($5.3m in a full year).

 SECONDARY ALLOWANCES SCHEME (SAS)

 Families on lower incomes with children in Years II and 12 

 at secondary schools will benefit significantly from changes 

 to the Secondary Allowances Scheme.

 The maximum allowance will be increased by 15% from $1046 

 to $1202 per annum, and there will be a 10% increase in the 

 qualifying level of the income test.

 Entitlement is based on the adjusted family income,  which is 

 the gross parental income for the previous financial year 

 less a deduction of $450 for each other dependent child and 

 certain business deductions for expenditure incurred in 

 gaining the income. For 1935 the level of adjusted family 

 income at which the maximum allowance is paid will be 

 increased from $12,983 to $14,281. This is the same as the 

 level applied under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme.

 Where the adjusted family income exceeds $14,281, benefits will 

 be reduced by $2.50 for every $10 of additional income. The 

 minimum allowance, $17 a year, will be paid on adjusted family 

 incomes between $19,021 and $19,030.

 If more than one student in a family qualifies for benefits, 

 the rate of reduction of allowance drops to $1.25 for every 

 $10 of additional income. Families with two eligible children 

 therefore will receive some benefits on adjusted family incomes 

 of up to $23,780.

 SAS 2

 Some examples of the amount of allowance payable at various 

 levels of adjusted family income are shown in the following 

 table:

 Allowance - 1985

 Adjusted Family 

 Income 1983/84

 for one eligible 

 child

 for each of two 

 eligible children

 ($) ($) ($)

 14,281 1,202.00 1,202.00

 15,000 1,024.50 1,113.25

 16,000 774.50 988.25

 17,500 399.50 800.75

 19,000 24.50 613.25

 21,500 - 300.75

 23,500 - 50.75

 The changes reflect the Government's concern to provide greater 

 encouragement to families to keep their children at school 

 for the final two secondary years.

 They are expected to increase the number of students assisted 

 by the scheme from 60,000 in 1984 to 64,000 in 1985. It is 

 estimated that expenditure under the scheme will increase from 

 $56 million to $68 million.

 ASEAS assists mature students,  ie ,  those aged over 19 who have 

 been away from secondary schooling for a total period of at least 

 two years in the previous five years, to undertake matriculation 

 level courses. Assistance is generally provided for one year, 

 but two years' benefits are available in some circumstances.

 There is some relaxation of the eligibility conditions for 

 refugee students.

 ADULT SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE SCHEME (ASEAS)

 For 1985 the living allowances paid under the scheme will once 

 more be aligned with those of the Tertiary Education Assistance 

 Scheme (TEAS). This will mean a 16.7% increase in the allowance 

 rates, as follows:

 Type of Allowance 1984 1985

 at-home $ 1 ,990pa ($38.06pw) $2,32lpa ($44.51pw)

 away-from-home $3,068pa ($58.68pw) $3,581pa ($68.6?pw)

 independent $3,068pa ($58.68pw) $3,581pa ($68.67pw)

 The level of adjusted family income (i.e. parental income in the 

 previous financial year less certain deductions) at which maximum 

 allowances will be paid for 1985 will be increased by 10% from 

 $12,983 to $14,281. For adjusted family income in excess 

 of $14,281, the allowance will be reduced on a sliding scale.

 A partial allowance will be paid in 1985 where the adjusted 

 family income does not exceed $22,280 for the at-home allowance 

 and $27,320 for the away-from-home allowance.

 Where a student is married, an income test is applied to the 

 spouse's income for the previous financial year. The level of 

 the spouse's income at which the maximum benefits will be paid 

 in 1985 will also be increased from $12,983 to $14,281. A 

 partial allowance will be paid where the spouse's income does 

 not exceed $20,844. Other benefits provided under ASEAS are 

 an allowance of $42.70 a week for a dependent spouse, $14 a 

 week for each dependent child (increased from $10 a week in 

 1984), and an incidentals allowance of $30.

 ASEAS 2

 Beneficiaries living away from home may also receive a 

 fares allowance for three return trips a year between home 

 and their educational institutions.

 Expenditure under the scheme is expected to increase from 

 $7.8 million to about $9.9 million in 1985. About 3,250 

 students are expected to benefit under the Scheme next 

 year.

 POSTGRADUATE AWARDS

 Postgraduate Awards provided by the Commonwealth assist people 

 studying for Masters and PhD degrees on a full-time basis at 

 universities and colleges of advanced education. Awards are 

 tenable for up to two years for Masters courses and up to 

 four years for a PhD. The Awards are competitive. They 

 are made available free of an income test, but benefits are 

 taxable.

 There are three types of Postgraduate Awards - Research Awards 

 for Masters and PhD programs by research at universities,

 Course Awards for Masters courses by coursework in universities, 

 and Advanced Education Institution Awards for Masters courses in 

 colleges of advanced education. The total number of new 

 Awards available for 1985 will be 900.

 The living allowance under the Awards will be increased by 3.9% 

 for 1985, from $7,330 to $7,616; and the dependent child 

 allowance will be increased from $10 to $14 per week to 

 realign it with the corresponding Social Security benefit.

 Other benefits provided under the Awards include a dependent 

 spouse allowance of $42.70 a week and incidentals, thesis and 

 establishment allowances. An award holder may receive $1,000 

 from an award provided by an educational institution and 

 $5,000 from an award provided by private sector sources without 

 affecting the entitlement.

 As a result of the Budget decisions, expenditure on Postgraduate 

 Awards is expected to rise from $17.5 million for 1984 to 

 approximately $18.5 million for 1985.

 ASSISTANCE FOR ISOLATED CHILDREN SCHEME (AIC)

 This scheme provides financial assistance to the parents 

 of children w h o ,  by reason of geographic isolation or a handicap 

 must live away from home to attend school,  study by 

 correspondence or live at a second family home which 

 provides daily access to schooling.

 Students living away from home to attend school comprise some 

 75 % of those assisted under the scheme. All such students 

 who satisfy the eligibility requirements qualify for a basic 

 allowance of $927 a year free of income test.  They may also 

 attract an additional allowance which depends on their 

 parents' income and their boarding costs.

 For 1985 the levels of the Additional Boarding Allowance 

 will rise by between 6.1% and 7.1%, the result being an overall 

 increase of 3.9% in the maximum benefit available for an 

 eligible boarder at any level of schooling.

 A comparison between the Î984 and 1985 rates of the Additional 

 Boarding Allowance is given below. The new maximum benefit 

 available (i.e. the total of the basic and additional

 boarding allowances) is shown in brackets in each case.

 1984 1985

 Senior secondary $1,645 ($2,572). $1,745 ($2,672)

 Junior secondary $1,355 ($2,282) $1,444 ($2,371)

 Primary $1,140 ($2,067) $1,221 ($2,148)

 There will also be a substantial relaxation of the income 

 test, enabling a greater proportion of eligible students to 

 qualify for this additonal allowance. The income test is 

 based on the gross parental income for the previous financial 

 year less a deduction of $450 for each other dependent 

 child and certain business deductions for costs incurred in 

 gaining the income. For 1985 the level of adjusted family 

 income at which the maximum Additional Boarding Allowance is

 paid will be increased by 20% from $10,812 to $12,974.

 Smaller amounts of allowance will be paid, on a sliding scale, 

 on income levels above $12,974. These upper income levels will 

 be even higher where more than one student in the family 

 qualifies for AIC benefits. The table below illustrates the 

 levels of income up to which some Additional Boarding Allowance 

 will be paid in 1985, depending on the student's year of 

 schooling and the number of other eligible children in the 

 family.

 No other  eligible  child

 One other eligible child

 Two other eligible children

 Senior secondary $19,903 $26,823 

 Junior secondary $18,693 $24,413 

 Primary $17,803 $22,623

 $33,743

 $30,123

 $27,453

 The scheme will continue to provide in 1985 a correspondence 

 allowance of $500 a year per child and second home allowances 

 ranging from $927 to $2,364 a year per family, as well as 

 special allowances for pre-school correspondence children and 

 children in short-term boarding situations. All these allowances 

 are free of income test.

 The total number of children expected to qualify for AIC 

 benefits in 1985 is expected to be about 21,800. It is 

 estimated that expenditure under the scheme will rise from 

 about $22.6 million in 1984 to about $23.9 million in 1985.
