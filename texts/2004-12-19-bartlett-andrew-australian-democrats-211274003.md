 DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/1149 SUNDAY 19 DECEMBER 2004         SENATOR ANDREW BARTLETT   DEPUTY LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATS               STATEMENT ON REFUGEES’ HUNGER STRIKE   Senator Andrew Bartlett has said he will continue his fast in support of the Iranians locked up in Baxter detention centre.  “Whilst I was initially only planning to fast for a couple of days, I do believe it is important to stress how very serious the situation is and how completely desperate the people in detention are,” Senator Bartlett said.  “I have not said I will hunger strike for as long as the detainees do. I will take it one day at a time in deciding what is best, but what I have said is that I will continue to support them, as do many thousands of people in the Australian community, in their struggle for justice and freedom.  “I do not encourage people in detention to engage in hunger strikes, as it risks causing them serious self-harm and I continue to encourage those people in Baxter to resume eating. They have already shown their strength and determination, and many Australians are even more committed to do what they can to help them.  “However, whilst I do not encourage self-harm, it is very important to continue to show support for them and to try to demonstrate to the wider public just how incredibly serious the situation they face is.”  “The asylum seekers are faced with a so-called ‘choice’ between perpetual imprisonment and serious persecution. Some have already been locked up for over 5 years for committing no crime. In such a situation, it is not surprising that people will resort to desperate measures.”  “Showing solidarity with the asylum seekers is one measure that can prevent them from giving up hope all together, which would risk more dire consequences. What they do should be a decision entirely for them, which is why I do not want to link my decision on fasting to theirs.”  “The Australian Government must take the simple step of acknowledging that our law has led to a grossly unjust situation. A recent report by the Edmund Rice Centre has shown that many asylum seekers deported have been persecuted on their return. Iran is a country with one the worst human rights records in the world and we should not be returning people to such a situation,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
