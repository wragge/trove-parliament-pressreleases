  Senator Andrew Bartlett  Leader of the Australian Democrats  Spokesperson on Immigration and Multicultural Affairs 

  New solution needed for asylum seekers  The Australian Democrats today said the Howard Government could no longer continue with its  abhorrent policy that risks the lives of asylum seekers. 

  Democrats’ Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said both the Howard Government and Labor had  to take responsibility for the existing callous policy that would see two boat loads of  Vietnamese asylum seekers headed for Australia either turned back or processed off-shore. 

  Labor’s spokesperson for Immigration Julia Gillard was wrong when she claimed Indonesia  packing the boat off on its treacherous voyage to Australia signalled the Government had not  worked out a viable solution to people smuggling with Indonesia, Senator Bartlett said. 

  “What has failed is the inhumane Pacific Solution brought into being with the aid of the ALP,”  Senator Bartlett said. 

  “Both of these major parties are to blame for this callous and appalling policy. 

  “What Indonesia has done is adopt Australia’s approach to asylum seekers. Indonesia has done  what the Australian Government instructed the Navy to do to hundreds of desperate people in  2001. 

  “Both Philip Ruddock and the ALP must now admit that they cannot continue with a policy  which violates international law and inflicts untold suffering on hundreds of people. 

  “Continuing with this approach, which ignores the humanitarian and moral responsibilities of  dealing with boatloads of desperate people fleeing persecution in potentially unseaworthy craft,  will only lead to floating death ships. 

  “These asylum seekers are on overcrowded boats with no navigation equipment and they are in  danger of sinking. Yet the Government and the ALP have shown no concern for the men,  women and children who are so obviously in danger. 

  “The civilized and humane approach to this current situation is to conduct a stringent  surveillance exercise to locate the boats as soon as they enter international waters and to ensure  that they reach Australia safely for processing.” 

  Senator Bartlett said transporting more people to Nauru was not an option. The medical  facilities at Nauru are so inadequate and ill people are regularly transported to Australia for  treatment. 

  “As outrageous as our detention centres are here in Australia they are infinitely better than the  centres on Nauru,” Senator Bartlett said.
