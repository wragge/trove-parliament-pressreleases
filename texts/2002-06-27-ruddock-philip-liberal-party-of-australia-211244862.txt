 Reality Check Needed for Opposition Leader MPS 57/2002

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock said today it was time the Leader of the Opposition caught up with the present on the Government's achievements on border control.

 The Government's policies have curtailed the activities of smugglers in their attempts to bring people to Australia unlawfully by boat.

 Contrary to Mr Crean's posturing, the Government has been working co-operatively with other Government's within the region to effect the arrest of known people smugglers.

 Arrests have occurred in Cambodia, Thailand, Singapore and Australia and prosecutions and extradition proceedings have been instigated, but from his comments in the Parliament, it appears Mr Crean is not aware of this or is in denial.

 Mr Crean continues to peddle simplistic policies in continuing to call for a coastguard as the solution to unauthorised boat arrivals.

 This is not an area that lends itself to simplistic solutions and the Australian people should not be misled.

 Australia continues to work with its regional partners, source and transit countries to ensure that people smuggling avenues are closed.

 The Government has a range of agreements with many countries, such as Cambodia, Afghanistan and Indonesia relating to law enforcement, return arrangements and fighting illegal immigration.

 It is time the Opposition drew breath and actually thought about some of the statements they are making regarding border protection.

 The Government will continue to attack people smugglers and their trade with vigour and Mr Ruddock highlighted the Government's most recent legislation relating to further excision of islands in the north of Australia.

 This legislation was another instrument designed to ensure that Australia remains a diminished target in the eyes of the people smugglers.

 Rather than playing politics, Mr Crean should bring his party on-board and support this legislation.
