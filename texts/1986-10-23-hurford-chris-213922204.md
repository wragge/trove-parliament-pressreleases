 DECLINING POPULATION WITHIN 45 YEARS WITHOUT IMMIGRATION

 Without immigration Australia's population will begin to   decline by the year 2030. This is one of the major findings of   a report tabled in Parliament today by the Minister for   Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Chris Hurford.

 Mr Hurford said the report, Australia's Population Trends and   Prospects 1986, showed the average annual rate of population   growth to the year 2020 would be the same as the current   relatively low level of 1.27 per cent even if annual  

 immigration intakes were of the order of 155,000, well above   the present levels.

 Mr Hurford said demographic trends developed slowly. "If we   want to influence the long-term direction of Australia's   population levels, we must act now and sustain our actions over   many years. People make a nation. To consider the population   we want is to consider the type of nation we want," he said.

 "It is all too easy to leave the future to chance and react as   events unfold.  However, rather than sit back and let events   dictate policy, our Labor Government is determined to shape   long-term developments to maximise benefits. Population policy  

 is inextricably linked to economic policy and to Australia's   place in the world."

 The report includes as a special topic an analysis of the   changing Australian family. It highlights the fact that   despite some significant changes since the last century, the   family will remain the context in which Australian children  

 will be raised. However, a greater diversity of family types   could be expected.

 Some notable trends include a continued decline in average  family size from more than six children last century to  slightly more than two by the year 2000; an increase in  voluntary childlessness; an increase in de facto relationships  and a consequent increase in ex-nuptial births; and a decrease 

 in recent years in divorce rates.

 The report includes population forecasts to 1991 based on  gradual increases in the level of immigration. "A strategy of  sensibly managed increases in the intake will serve to maximise  the social and economic benefits of immigration to Australia,"  Mr Hurford said.

 "In this context I welcome the migration program outcome for  1985/86, which saw 93,051 people approved for migration to  Australia. This included 25,949 close family members, 29,791  extended family applicants, 15,841 skilled, business and 

 independent migrants and 11,700 refugees and special  humanitarian program immigrants. It was greater than the  84,000 planning level, due to an increase in the extended  family intake.

 "Abundantly clear from the report is the pervasiveness of the  population factor. No better example could be cited than the  ageing of the population and the implications that progressive  ageing will have for society.

 "This annual report provides a valuable mechanism for the  monitoring of demographic trends. This is crucial to the  development of sound, long-term policies. We should all  participate in determining the future Australia," Mr Hurford 

 added.

 A copy of the highlights of the report and the final  immigration program figures for 1985/86 are attached.

 HIGHLIGHTS

 Special topic: The Australian Family

 . In 1982 there were 4,070,500 families in Australia, accounting for 90 per cent of the population. Of these   families, 88 per cent were married/de facto couple   families.

 . Increasingly, Australians have been marrying at older ages. At the same time children have been leaving home   at an earlier age. These trends underlie the increase   in the population living in non-family situations.

 . The percentage of the population representing those who  have never married is increasing. This is due, in part,   to the rise in the number of de facto unions.

 . The period between marriage and first birth is increasing, in part because many couples are waiting   until they develop a better economic base on which to   begin childbearing.

 . There is a growing trend towards voluntary childlessness. Of those women who recently passed   through the childbearing years, only 8 per cent remained   childless. It has been estimated that as many as 20 per   cent of women born in the early 1950s may remain   childless.

 .  Since 1983 divorce rates have declined. This could be related to the drop in the number of marriages,  an older   age of first marriage (which tends to lower the   probability of divorce), the increasing tendency for   couples to live together before marrying and the passing  

 of the impact of the introduction of the Family Law Act.

 . Trends to smaller families, childless couple families and elderly couple families may result in an increased   demand for smaller and/or medium density housing. A   continued rise in the number of people living in  

 non-family situations may increased the potential for   loneliness and isolation in society which may lead to a   growing need for support services. These are just two   examples indicating the wide-ranging implications of   changes to the family.

 Population trends and prospects

 . Australia's rate of population growth increased in

 1984-85 to 1.26 per cent. This was primarily due to a   higher level of immigration wich increased moderately in   1984-85 after a near post-Warld War II low in 1983-84.   Moderate increases in immigration are expected to   continue for some t i m e .

 . The rate of population growth in the future is likely to

 be particularly sensitive to the level of migration as   natural increase is projected to decline steadily.

 . In the absence of immigration, natural increase is

 projected to reach zero by about 2030.

 . The level of fertility is declining and is forecast to

 continue to do so for some time. Despite this, the   annual number for births is expected to increase in the   medium term as a result of a continued rise in the   childbearing population.

 . Numbers of settlers from the United Kingdom, the

 Republic of Ireland and other European countries   increased in 1985-86. Numbers from Asia declined   slightly.

 . One in five Australians was born outside Australia and

 slightly more than one-third of these people are from   the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.

 . Between 1985 and 2020 the ratio of the aged to the

 working age population is projected to rise from 19.6   per cent to 29.6 per cent - an increase of 51 per cent.   This increase would be lower with higher levels of   immigration.

 . Changes at the older ages will have significant

 implications for social security. Of critical   importance will be the extent of superannuation c ov e r ,   particularly of the baby boom generations. The sharp   rise in the 75 years and over population will have  

 important implications in the health and social welfare   a r e a s .

 . Some States attract more overseas migrants than others.

 In recent years New South Wales and Western Australia   have attracted comparatively large numbers.

 . Future State and Territory population growth will be

 most affected by trends in international and interstate   migration. A continuation of recent trends would result   in Queensland, Western Australia and the two Territories   growing fastest, primarily due to interstate migration.
