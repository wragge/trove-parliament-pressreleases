 TB Testing for Boat Arrivals MPS 080/2000

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock today rejected suggestions circulating in South Australia, that insufficient testing was being carried out to identify illegal boat arrivals with active TB.

 "Since February this year, all boat arrivals over the age of 12, with the exception of pregnant women are given a chest X-ray within two weeks of arrival to check for TB, while children undergo a Mantoux test," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Those detainees who had not previously been X-rayed have been given an X-ray under the new procedures.

 "This enables isolation and thorough treatment of active TB while the person remains in detention.

 "The number of detainees who have been found to have active TB in the past six months is very low.

 "Even prior to the updated procedures, detainees over the age of 16, who were found to have a lawful right to remain in Australia were required to have a chest X-ray prior to being granted a visa."
