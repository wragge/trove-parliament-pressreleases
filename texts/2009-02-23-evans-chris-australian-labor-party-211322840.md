 Senator Chris Evans  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship 

 

 A strengthened commitment to our international obligations 

 Monday, 23 February 2009 

 The Australian Government will strengthen its international humanitarian  commitment with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans,  today announcing a  $4.4 million increase in funding to the United Nation’s refugee agency.   

 As the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres, makes  his first visit to Australia, Senator Evans said the additional funding will contribute to  UNHCR's operating funds globally and allow for longer term planning and flexible  responses to emerging situations.  

 ‘As a sign of our increased commitment to this partnership, Australia is increasing its  core funding to the UNHCR by $4.4 million to $14.3 million,’ Senator Evans said. 

 ‘This is in addition to the $4.2 million the Australian Government provides for  UNHCR operations in the Asia Pacific region to build a stronger protection space  and provide services to displaced populations.  

 ‘The Government also provides another $2 million specifically to support UNHCR's  delivery of protection assessments and undertake outreach activities in Indonesia.’ 

 Senator Evans said he and Mr Guterres had discussed the importance of Australia  and the UNHCR continuing to work together with countries in the region to provide  support to refugees and reduce opportunities for people smugglers, including  through the development of durable solutions for displaced populations. 

 ‘Australia will continue to resettle refugees from the region referred by UNHCR, to  fund projects which provide assistance to displaced populations and to seek to  provide alternatives to asylum seekers risking their lives by engaging people  smugglers,’ Senator Evans said. 

 During the meeting, the minister briefed the High Commissioner on significant  reforms to Australia’s international protection framework. 

 ‘We have ended the Howard government’s Pacific Strategy, abolished the punitive  temporary protection visa regime and introduced access to legal advice, independent  review, oversight by the Immigration Ombudsman and procedural fairness for  unauthorised boat arrivals,’ Senator Evans said.  

 ‘All these changes reflect the government’s commitment to humanity, fairness and  integrity in its refugee policies.   

 ‘The government is also considering what measures may be appropriate to better  address the situation of stateless people.’ 

 The High Commissioner will travel to Melbourne and Sydney where he will meet key  stakeholders and see for himself how Australia’s settlement services support  refugees in their new life. It is the first visit by a High Commissioner since 2004. 

 ‘One of Australia’s key contributions to the system of international protection is our  offshore humanitarian program,’ the minister said. 

 ‘We remain one of the top three refugee resettlement countries in the world and last  year granted 13 014 visas to refugees. The government has increased Australia’s  refugee and humanitarian intake for 2008-09 to 13 500, with a one-off increase of  500 places for Iraqi refugees. 

 ‘Through our protection and resettlement programs and our international  engagement and capacity-building, Australia will continue to play a constructive and  active role in addressing international protection needs, in particular those of people  who have suffered for years in the world’s refugee camps.’
