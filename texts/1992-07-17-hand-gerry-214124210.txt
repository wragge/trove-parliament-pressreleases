 BETTER CONTROL OF AUSTRALIA'S BORDERS PLANNED

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, today foreshadowed a number of  amendments to the Migration Act which will strengthen the  Government's ability to enforce migration law.

 The amendments,  to be introduced in the 1992 Budget  Sittings, relate to entry control, the detention and removal  from Australia of non-citizens, and includes the recently  -  announced changes to review mechanisms (see MPS 35/92) . r

 Mr Hand said the measures would greatly simplify and  rationalise current laws, providing improved mechanisms to  control the entry of people, ensure that they are lawfully  here, and allowing for the removal of those without lawful 

 status.

 "The changes will ensure that the Government is able to  control fully the movement of people across Australia's â  borders," he said.

 "Entry mechanisms will be simplified by requiring a person  to hold only one document —  a visa.

 "All non-Australian citizens entering Australia will be  required to undergo immigration clearance, and all  Australian citizens will be required to produce proof of  citizenship on entry."

 In addition, Mr Hand said, a system of determinative merits review was proposed fpr__most_decisions made -under- the  --- -— Migration Act.

 "This will provide a fairer and more comprehensive process  of review for people who wish to appeal against adverse  decisions," he said.
