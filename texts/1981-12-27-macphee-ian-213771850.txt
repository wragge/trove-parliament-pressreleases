 From the Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs. The Hon Ian Macphee, MP

 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FLY OUT OF DARWIN

 One hundred and twenty seven illegal immigrants were flown out  of Darwin by QANTAS charter aircraft this morning, the Minister  for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee, said today.

 They were part of a group of 146 who posed as Vietnamese refugees  when they arrived in Darwin on a fishing boat in early October.

 Investigations by immigration officials, Australian Federal Police  and Hong Kong police revealed that the illegal immigrants had paid  large sums of money as part of an organised attempt at illegal  entry to Australia, Mr Macphee said.

 Most of those aboard the plane are being returned to Taiwan. Six  of them will be flown to Hong Kong.

 The other 19 will be moved temporarily.to the Villawood Detention  Centre, Sydney, pending further enquiries following which they will  also be deported.

 Mr Macphee said that he was grateful for the co-operation received  throughout Asia during the investigations.

 Any similar rackets will be dealt with in the same way with the same  high level of international co-operation and the deportation of the  offenders. '
