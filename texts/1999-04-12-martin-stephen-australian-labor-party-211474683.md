  MARTIN CALLS FOR GREATER ADF ROLE IN COASTAL 
SURVEILLANCE

  

  The Shadow Minister for Defence, Stephen Martin, today called for 
the Australian De fence Force to play a greater role in surveilling 
Australia’s maritime approaches following the arrival of a further 
100 illegal immigrants on a NSW beach just one month after 26 boat people 
arrived on a Cairns beach unannounced.

  

 Mr Martin said: “I am aware that the issue of the 
ADF playing a greater role in coastal surveillance has been raised a 
number of times over the last two decades, however technological advances 
mean that the ADF could play a much greater role in protecting our coastline.”

  

 “Recently the Chief of the Defence Force, Admiral 
Chris Barrie, wrote on the possibility of military organisations giving 
priority to broader national security requirements with the role of 
the military being likely to involve constabulary type activities. This 
redefines all traditional thinking about the role of the ADF.

  

 “The ADF is ideally equipped to assist. Military 
surveillance capacity, such as JORN could be used to track and identify 
incursions. Aircraft and naval patrols should play a role in identification 
and in interception if necessary.

  

 The Royal Australian Air Force currently contributes 
around 250 hours per annum of P3C Orion aircraft surveillance whilst 
the Navy contributes its patrol boats which are available for a total 
of 1 800 boat days per annum and are based in Cairns and Darwin.

  

 Mr Martin said: “The Government should also review 
the type of replacement for the ageing Fremantle Class Patrol Boats 
and examine the possibility of purchasing a smaller, faster craft that 
would be better suited to monitoring our borders.

  

 “Another option that could be considered is the 
formation of an organisation similar to the United States Coastguard. 
Labor will examine all possible options as it seeks to address the appalling 
situation that currently exists in policing our borders.

  

 “We need to make sure that Coastwatch, the Australian 
Defence Force and other law enforcement agencies are coordinated in 
their approach so that we get best use of the available resources to 
protect our borders.”
