 Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales   

 02 February 2004   

 Labor still spooked by asylum seekers  

 Labor's expected failure to adopt changes to its refugee policy leaves little difference  between Labor and Liberal policies, Greens Senator Kerry Nettle said today.    

 "Labor has failed to end temporary protection visas (TPVs), will not close down the razor  wire camps and continues to support the One Nation policy of diverting people to  Christmas Island where they have no access to the courts.    

 "Labor's retention of TPVs for people who are proven refugees is a breach of  international law and will put lives at risk. Putting the decision to make an exception in  the hands of the minister is no different to what occurs now.    

 "Having Christmas Island permanently removed from Australian law simply turns the  Pacific solution into the Indian Ocean Solution.    

 "The Greens will continue to attract voters in many crucial seats as long as Labor fails to  show compassion to asylum seekers."
