 CHRIS BOWEN MP 

 MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP   

 MEDIA RELEASE 

 26 August 2011 

 

 Ministerial intervention statistics online   

 Statistical information relating to Ministerial Intervention in individual immigration cases is  now online and will be published every six months, the Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, announced today.   

 Under the Migration Act 1958, the Minister has a range of powers that allow him to intervene  in individual cases, where it is in the public interest to do so.   

 Mr Bowen said this was the first time Ministerial Intervention statistics had been published,  and followed the release of asylum seeker and refugee statistics in May this year.   

 “Ministerial Intervention powers act as a safety net, allowing me to assist the relatively small  number of people whose cases have not been resolved through a visa process and whose  circumstances are compassionate and compelling,” Mr Bowen said.   

 “The publication of this statistical information about Ministerial Intervention requests and  outcomes will enhance the transparency and accountability of government processes.”   

 By using the Ministerial Intervention powers, the Minister can grant a visa where there are  compelling and compassionate circumstances and other avenues have been exhausted.    

 Between 15 September 2010 and 30 June 2011, Mr Bowen finalised 2,020 requests for  intervention under sections 351 and 417 of the Act. The minister also granted 437 visas,  which is a grant rate of 22 per cent.   

 These statistics are outlined in the Ministerial Intervention Statistics Australia 2010-11  publication, now available on the Department of Immigration and Citizenship website.   

 The publication includes the number of requests for intervention received and finalised, types  of visas granted, and the citizenship of people requesting and being granted visas through  intervention. The statistics will be published biannually.   

 The publication can be found at: www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/
