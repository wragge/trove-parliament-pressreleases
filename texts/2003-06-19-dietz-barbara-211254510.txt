 Opportunities and frictions: the integration path of ethnic Germans,

 1950-2000

 Barbara Dietz

 Introduction

 The immigration of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union played  a  significant  role  in  the  post  World  War  II  immigration  and  integration experience of Germany. In contrast to the labor migration since the middle of the fifties, the  inflow  of  ethnic  Germans  was  not  related  to  economic  factors  like  recruitment programs  or  the  business  cycle.  Because  ethnic  Germans  in  Eastern  Europe  and  the former  Soviet  Union  had  experienced  forced  resettlement  and  ethnic  discrimination during and after World War II, they were allowed to enter Germany and were granted the German citizenship after arrival.

 Until the end of the eighties the absorption and integration of ethnic German immigrants proceeded  comparatively  straightforwardly.  However,  since  the  political  changes  in Eastern  Europe  and  the  break-up  of  the  Soviet  Union,  the  economic  and  social integration  of  recent  ethnic  German  immigrants  has  been  characterized  by  frictions, which are similar to those of other immigrant populations. As a result, the integration path  of  ethnic  Germans  attracted  the  interest  of  migration  and  integration  research which so far had not paid much attention to the absorption of this group. It became an increasingly  discussed  research  topic  to  what  extends  and  for  what  reasons  the integration  process  of  ethnic  Germans  had  changed.  Historians,  economists  and  social scientists contributed to that debate, referring to  various  theoretical  considerations  and comparisons with other immigrant cohorts.

 Against this background, the following paper analyses continuities and frictions in the integration  path  of  ethnic  Germans.  Furthermore,  the  most  important  factors, determining the  mode  of  integration  and  its  changes,  are  explored.  In  this  context  the paper focuses on the immigration and absorption policy, the sending country and socio-demographic characteristics of ethnic German immigrants, the opportunity structure of

 the receiving society and the role of networks in the migration and integration process.

 As a starting point, the first  part  of the paper describes the legal  aspects of the ethnic German immigration to Germany and explains the specific immigration and integration policy  for  this  group.  In  a  second  part  the  sending  country  and  human  capital characteristics of ethnic German immigrants are portrayed. It will be argued that legal immigration  procedures  determine  the  quantity  and  selectivity  of  ethnic  German immigrants  to  a  considerable  extent.  Furthermore  the  unfolding  of  network  dynamics and its consequences in the migration process will be shown. The third part analyses the economic and social integration of recent ethnic German immigrants in comparison to earlier  cohorts.  It  additionally  focuses  on  the  development  and  implications  of  ethnic German  migrant  networks.  The  basic  question  is,  whether  networks  tend  to  support integration processes or if they rather lead to segmented assimilation and the creation of segregated ethnic German migrant communities. In exploring these various aspects, the paper  wants  to  contribute  to  the  understanding  of  integration  processes,  using  the absorption of ethnic Germans as an example.

 1. Immigration and integration of ethnic Germans: the role of politics

 The  post  World  War  II  migration  to  Germany  included  various  different  groups:  it consisted  of  expellees  and  refugees,  labor  migrants,  asylum  seekers  and  to  a considerable degree also of ethnic Germans (Bade 2000). Between 1950 and the end of 2002 as many as 4,26 million ethnic Germans were admitted, 63% of them after 1988. This  population  movement  took  place  after  the  expulsion  and  forced  migration  of German citizens and ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union during and immediately after World War II had come to an end. At that time—in the beginning of  the  fifties—a  remarkable  number  of  Germans  (approximately  4  million)  were  still living  in  Eastern  Europe  and  the  former  Soviet  Union,  holding  the  citizenship  of  the respective states. Because of World War II with Germany as the aggressor, the German minority in  Eastern  Europe  and  the  USSR  became a discriminated group in the fifties and  sixties.  Whereas  the  Germans  in  Romania  and  to  a  lesser  degree  those  in  Poland still had some opportunities to preserve the German language and cultural traditions, the Germans in the Soviet Union were not allowed to speak German in public until the end of the sixties and suffered severe discrimination in daily life.

 To guarantee a homeland for ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union who  had  experienced  forced  resettlement  and  ethnic  discrimination,  the  1949  German constitution  introduced  their  right  to  move  to  Germany  and  receive  the  German citizenship  (Basic  Law,  article  116  (1))  after  arrival  (Halfmann  1997)1  This  puts  the immigration  of  ethnic  Germans  in  line  with  many  past  and  contemporary  migration flows  which  are—in  addition  to  economic  reasons—connected  to  political  and  ethno-national  determinants.  In  these  cases  population  movements  occur  against  the background of political crisis and ethnic conflicts in the countries of origin and political security and ethnic affinity in the receiving states (Brubaker 1998: 1049).

 In this context, the concept of Diaspora migration represents a specific form: It is based on the perception of belonging and returning of migrants to a former homeland (Shuval 1998: 9). Because the migration of ethnic Germans to Germany is linked to the political construction  of  coethnics  returning  to  their  nation-state  it  meets  the  basic  criteria  of Diaspora  migration  (Shuval  1998:  10).  A  similar  constellation  can  be  found  in  other ethno-national  migration  flows,  for  example  the  Jewish  migration  from  the  (former) Soviet Union to Israel, the migration of Greeks and Finns from the successor states of the USSR to their respective homelands, the  movement  of  Hungarians  from  Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and the Ukraine to Hungary, the migration of Russians from the non-Russian  successor  states  of  the  Soviet  Union  to  Russia  and  the  return  movement  of Kazaks  from  Uzbekistan  or  China  to  the  newly  independent  Kazakhstan.  Typically these migration flows require some special support on the part of the receiving state and society. Both an ethno-national motivation on the side of the migrants and the powerful assistance  by  the  receiving  German  state  have  characterized  the  return  migration  of ethnic Germans.

 Due  to  political  and  ethno-national  considerations,  the  German  government  sustained the  ethnic  German  migration  since  the  beginning  of  the  50-s,  although  its  policy  has been characterized by remarkable changes in later years (Seifert 1997). Throughout the

 period of the cold war, the German government  actively supported  the  ethnic  German migration, urging the officials of the sending countries to remove emigration barriers.

 With the opening up of Eastern Europe at the end of the eighties and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the growing migration pressure turned the former open door policy of the  German  government  towards  ethnic  Germans  ambivalent.  Although  the  German authorities did not abolish the right of return, they exerted a strong effort to channel and control the immigration of this group (Groenendijk 1997: 468, Zimmermann 1999). A variety  of  measures—enforcement  of  admission  barriers,  reduction  of  integration support,  economic  assistance  to  the  sending  countries—has  been  introduced,  which usually  is  undertaken  to  prevent  undesired  immigration  (Martin  1994:  217).  All  these policies led first to a stabilization and later—since 1994—to a yearly decline in the total number of ethnic German immigrants.

 Figure 1

 Most importantly the criteria for those eligible to enter became severely stricter. In 1993 a new absorption law (Kriegsfolgenbereinigungsgesetz) has been adopted allowing only Germans  from  the  former  Soviet  Union  to  come  to  Germany  without  individually proving  that  they  had  been  discriminated  in  their  countries  of  origin  because  of  their German  descent.  As  serious  ethnic  discrimination  against  Germans  in  Poland  and Romania is almost non-existent since the political transformation, their emigration has

 nearly  ceased  with  the  enforcement  of  the  new  law  in  1993.  In  addition  this  law established an immigration quota, fixing a maximum number of 220,000 ethnic German immigrants  per  year.  In  1999,  authorities  further  reduced  this  quota  to  100,000. Moreover  a  German  language  test  has  been  introduced  in  July  1996.  Since  then potential  ethnic  German  immigrants  have  to  prove  a  certain  command  of  the  German language  as  a  confirmation  of  their  belonging  to  the  German  people

 (VolkszugehÃ¶rigkeit).  Because  Germans  in  the  former  Soviet  Union—which  is  the dominant sending country since 1993—were prevented from speaking German in public in  the  1950s  and  1960s,  many  of  them  had  lost  their  ties  to  their  mother  tongue. Consequently, 53% out of 271.532 ethnic Germans who participated in the language test between  July 1996  and  December  2002  failed.  It  is  remarkable  that  the  percentage  of ethnic Germans passing the test continuously declined since its introduction: while 74% mastered the language test in 1996, in 2002 only 43% passed. This clearly confirms the ethnic Germans loss of their mother tongue.

 Figure 2

 Notwithstanding its  long-lasting self-image  as  a  non-immigrant  country,  Germany has absorbed  a  significant  number  of  immigrants.  However,  the  modes  of  immigrant incorporation  were  significantly  different,  concerning  different  immigrant  groups. Whereas ethnic Germans receive the German citizenship shortly after arrival, migrants of  non-German  descent  have  to  fulfil  demanding  criteria  to  obtain  the  German citizenship.  According  to  the  eased  new  law  on  nationality  which  came  into  force  in January 2000, foreigners can apply for the German citizenship only after having stayed in Germany for eight years.2 In addition the new law states that children of foreigners

 become Germans by birth if one of their parents has lived in Germany for a minimum of eight years (ThrÃ¤nhardt 2000).

 The  regulations  on  citizenship  demonstrates  that  ethnic  Germans  are—with  respect  to legal  rights—a  privileged  group  in  Germany  compared  to  other  immigrants. Furthermore  ethnic  Germans  are  entitled  to  receive  governmental  integration  support. Although there were steady cuts since 1989, the German government still regards it as an  objective  to  actively  support  the  integration  of  ethnic  Germans  into  the  German economy  and  society.  In  2003  the  catalogue  of  assistance  measures  comprise  the following:

 â¢ financial assistance for unemployed ethnic Germans (for a maximum of six months). It can also be obtained while attending language classes

 â¢ language encouragement (for a maximum of six months)

 â¢ support for the integration into the labor market, advanced training and retraining

 â¢ support  for  the  social  integration  and  the  professional  advancement  of  juvenile ethnic Germans In  retrospect, the integration assistance, which  has  specifically been  developed  for  the absorption  of  ethnic  Germans,  triggered  a  positive  impulse  on  the  integration  of  this group until the end of the eighties. In later years, integration support has been severely cut  although  ethnic  German  immigrants  revealed  greater  problems  in  integrating  into the  German  labor  market  and  society.  This  has  to  be  interpreted  in  the  light  of  a fundamental  policy change.  Before  the  political  transformation  in  Eastern  Europe  and the  former  Soviet  Union,  the  integration  of  ethnic  Germans  has  been  sustained  to compensate  this  group  for  hardships  as  a  result  of  etho-national  discrimination  in  the former home countries. In later years the reduction of integration support was justified by  the  German  government  with  the  argumented  that  ethnic  Germans  should  not  be privileged compared to natives (Bommes 2000: 24).

 2. Sending countries, human capital characteristics and network dynamics

 Where do ethnic German immigrants come from and what is their demographic, social and  cultural  background?  It  has  already  been  pointed  out  that  there  have  been remarkable changes in the sending countries of ethnic Germans: between 1950 and 1989 nearly  two  thirds  (62%)  immigrated  from  Poland,  12%  came  from  the  former  Soviet Union  and  12%  from  Romania.3  In  the  course  of  the  nineties  (1990-2002)  the  former Soviet Union turned into the major sending country (83% of ethnic Germans came from there), far ahead of Poland (9%) and Romania (8%). This change is first of all due to the enforcement  of the new absorption law and to  a lesser degree also to  the fact  that  the German minority population in Poland and Romania had greatly diminished.

 

 3  A further 14% immigrated from other East European states.

 Reflecting the deportation history of the German minority in the Soviet Union, the most important post-Soviet sending state is Kazakhstan, followed by Russia and Kirgistan.4 Figure 3

 The majority of ethnic Germans who emigrated from the former USSR in the nineties has lived in a multiethnic setting, only a small group coming from traditional German enclaves.  In  general,  recent  ethnic  Germans  have  been  integrated  socially  within  the post-Soviet countries of origin. With the exception of some areas mainly in Kazakhstan and middle Asia, there was little ethnic discrimination against Germans in the successor states  of  the  Soviet  Union.  The German minority spoke the Russian language  in daily life  and  its  behavioral  patterns  and  norms  have  been  formed  in  post-Soviet  societies. Being part of the German minority in the former Soviet Union did not mean that ethnic Germans  mastered  the  German  language  and  that  they  maintained  German  cultural traditions.  In  most  cases  ethnic  Germans  from  the  former  USSR  preserved  an  ethnic identity,  based  on  the  descent  of  a  German  family  and  on  the  perception  by  the authorities in post-Soviet states. In that respect they differ strongly from previous ethnic German  migration  cohorts,  coming  from  Poland  and  Romania.  Especially  those  from Romania  spoke  the  German  language  in  the  family  and  many  had  visited  German schools in their former home countries. This explains the steady decline in the German language  competence  of  ethnic  Germans  as  the  share  of  immigrants  from  the  former Soviet Union increased.

 2.1. Human capital characteristics

 In  contrast  to  labor  migration  which  predominantly  involve  younger  (male) professionals,  the  ethnic  German  resettlement  included  whole  families  (Herwartz-Emden 1997). In most cases ethnic Germans moved out of their home countries without leaving open a return option. A further noticeable feature of ethnic German immigrants is their younger age structure, compared to the native German population: 44% of ethnic Germans were younger than 25 when arriving in the year 2000, while this quota is only 26%  in  the  German  population.  Whereas  the  age  structure  of  ethnic  Germans  and foreigners in Germany did not differ much in 1990, the age composition of foreigners in Germany had come noticeably closer to the native German population in 2000. This did not  happen  in  the case of ethnic Germans  who  are still  younger than natives  and  also than foreigners in Germany.

 Figure 4

 In general, the younger age structure of ethnic Germans has been regarded as a positive factor  with  respect  to  its  likely  impact  on  the  social  welfare  system  and  economic prosperity  in  Germany.  However,  the  desired  effects  of  the  ethnic  Germans  age composition will only materialize if the professional and social integration of this group, especially of the juveniles, will be successful.

 

 4  As a result of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in the Second World War, the Autonomous Territory  of  the  Volga  Germans  was  dissolved  in  1941,  followed  by  the  deportation  of  the  German population to the Eastern parts of the USSR, mainly to Siberia and Kazakhstan.

 It is comparatively difficult to evaluate the educational attainment and the qualification of ethnic Germans when arriving in Germany. Nevertheless, the small existing data base indicates that this immigrant group is better educated and trained than that of the labor migrants from the recruitment states to Germany (MÃ¼nz et al. 1999: 138). At the end of the eighties  labor office data reveal  that  two  thirds  of ethnic German immigrants  who had  been  employed  in  their  countries  of  origin  completed  no  more  than  a  lower education, whereas about 12% hold an university degree (Blaschke 1991: 56). Though one third of this group did not complete vocational training, 45% participated in it for at least two years. Because the education and qualification has been completed in (former) socialist  countries  in  many  cases  the  professional  qualifications  of  ethnic  Germans cannot be transferred or do not correspond to German labor market requirements.

 When  looking  at  the  occupational  structure  of  ethnic  Germans  several  important features  can  be  identified.  Whereas  in  Germany  occupation  in  agriculture  decreased remarkably  over  the  years,  the  share  of  ethnic  Germans  working  in  agriculture  even increased. This is due to the growing number of ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union, who still worked to a certain part in the agricultural sector. Moreover, industrial professions  are—compared  to  native  Germans—overrepresented  in  the  occupation structure of ethnic Germans. On the other hand, service jobs have a higher weight in the native  Germans  employment.  These  striking  differences  in  employment  structures between natives and ethnic German immigrants have to be explained against the distinct economic development path in Germany and in (post)socialist countries.

 Figure 5

 Because the technical gap between Germany and the (post)socialist sending countries of ethnic Germans has not been reduced over the years, the qualification of this immigrant group eventually did not come closer to the requirements of the German labor market. In many cases qualifications are related to professions in low demand and often do not

 meet  German  standards  (Ulrich  1994).  This  tendency  becomes  especially  clear  in  the case of industrial unskilled workers. In 1985, this occupation group had a share of 3.1% in native German employment and of 5.9% in that of ethnic Germans. In the year 2000, only 1.5%  of  the  native  German  workforce  was  performing unskilled  industrial  work, whereas  as  many  as  11.4%  of  ethnic  Germans  had  been  occupied  in  this  profession before  migration.  This  demonstrates  that  labor  market  risks  increased  for  ethnic Germans over time.

 2.2. The unfolding of network dynamics in the migration process

 In  the  beginning  the  ethnic  German  migration  from  Eastern  Europe  and  the  former Soviet Union to Germany was predominantly related to ethnic factors and to the wish for family reunification. First of all those ethnic Germans moved out who were highly

 motivated  to  preserve  the  German  language,  German  cultural  traditions  and  religious practices. Because of the deportation and discrimination against ethnic Germans during and  after  World  War  II,  the  wish  to  live  free  of  oppression  and  ethnic  tension  in Germany prevailed for many of the emigrants (Bade 1994a: 158). Until the end of the eighties, the invitation of first grade relatives in Germany had been the precondition to be allowed to leave the countries of origin. When the migration of ethnic Germans was not restricted anymore by the sending countries, a growing number of this group already

 7

 had  family  relations  to  Germany,  turning  this  population  movement  into  a  chain migration over time (Bauer and Zimmermann 1997a; Dietz 1999, Bade 1997).

 It has been argued by network theory that migration may begin for several motives, for escaping ethnic discrimination, for individual income gains, for family reunification or for  a  combination  of  all  of  these  factors  (Massey  et  al.  1993).  But  the  reasons  for  a persistence  of  migration  movements  may  become  independent  of  the  causes  which originally  triggered  off  migration:  across  time  and  space  migrant  networks  develop, which make additional movements more likely. Usually, migration networks are defined as âsets of interpersonal ties that connect migrants, former migrants, and nonmigrants in origin and destination areas through ties of kinship, friendship, and shared community origin. They increase the likelihood of international movements because they lower the costs and risk of movement and increase the expected net returns of migration“ (Massey et  al.  1993:  448).  This  implies  that  migration  networks  are  expected  to  influence  the individual  migration  decision  in  such  a  way that  the  greater the  number  of  migrants  a person  knows  in  a  sending  area  the  greater  the  probability  that  this  person  will  also migrate  (Portes  1997:  809).  Although  restrictive  governmental  policies  in  sending and receiving countries function as structural constraints on individual migration decisions, the  development  of  networks  may  counteract  migration  politics.  Because  of  the supportive  effect  of  migrant  networks,  governments  are  expected  to  have  increasing difficulties in controlling the migration flows after a migration movement has started.

 The  development  of  the  ethnic  German  migration  to  Germany  can  be  seen  as  an example for the unfolding network dynamic over time, also influencing the quantity and quality of this migration movement. Until the end of the eighties, emigration of ethnic Germans from former socialist countries was  basically limited  to  family reunification. Unintentionally  this  restrictive  policy  contributed  to  the  creation  of  migrant  networks where remaining relatives formed a migration potential in the sending areas. When the exit  barriers  in  the  Eastern  European  countries  and  the  (former)  Soviet  Union  were loosened as a result of the fall of the iron curtain, the immediate and dramatic growth of ethnic German migration to Germany was supported by migrant networks.

 Usually  migration  is  a  selective  process—especially  in  its  beginning  (Massey  et  al. 1994:  705).  In  many  cases,  relatively  skilled,  productive  and  highly  motivated  people are drawn away from the sending countries (Borjas 1987, Borjas 1994). If one looks at the  ethnic  German  migration  a  self-selection  could  also  be  observed,  although  the selection  expressed  itself  in  criteria  which  were  related  to  the  ethnic  minority background of this group.

 Until  the  end  of  the  eighties,  ethnic  German  immigrants  were  in  comparatively  good command of the German language and most of them did not live in bi-cultural families or in mixed marriages.5 This reflected the background of the German minority group in Romania to a certain degree, but has not been representative for the German minority in Poland  and  the  former  Soviet  Union.  In  Poland  and  the  former  USSR  the  German                                                 

 5  This has been proofed by several surveys. A representative study of ethnic German immigrants, who migrated  from  the  former  Soviet  Union  to  Germany  between  1977  and  1987  revealed  that  92%  of  the married respondents had a German spouse. Additionally the survey found out that 65% of the respondents had  a  good  command  of  the  German  language  before  migrating  to  Germany  (Dietz  1995:  41).  Similar results were found by a further representative survey, which explored the socio-demographic background of ethnic German immigrants from Poland, Romania and the USSR, who had come to Germany in 1976 (Arnold 1980).

 8

 language  competence  of  the  German  minorities  has  diminished  considerably since  the end of World War II. Although 48% of the German minority named German its mother tongue according to the Soviet Union population census in 1989, this statement was first of all related to an ethnic identification and not to the language competence (Dietz 1995: 43). The 1994 micro census in Russia found out that 36% of the ethnic German minority denoted  German  their  mother  tongue,  but  only  13%  spoke  German  in  the  family (Goskomstat Rossii 1995: 6, 91). The rate of mixed marriages in the German population of the USSR has been high compared to other ethnic groups in this country: already at the end of the seventies nearly half of the German couples lived in mixed marriages in Kazakhstan  and  Russia  (Dietz  1995:  46).  In  1988  and  1989  Soviet  Union  population statistics showed that Germans had the highest rates of mixed marriages (65%) among the analyzed nationalities in these years (Dietz 1995: 46).

 In  the  recent  decade  the  German  language  competence  of  ethnic  German  immigrants decreased and the share of bi-cultural families increased, making this migration cohort ever  more  similar  to  that  of  the  sending  countries’  population.  A  survey  study  with young  ethnic  German  immigrants—who  had  come  from  the  former  USSR  between 1990 and 1994—found that only 33% of the young respondents  were  in  good  or  very good  command  of  the  German  language  when  questioned  in  1995/96.  Most  of  them (52%)  reported  a  mediocre  knowledge  of  the  German  language,  whereas  14%  knew German  badly  or  very  badly  (Dietz  and  Roll  1998:  64).  The  growing  bi-cultural background  of  the  recent  ethnic  German  immigration  has  been  documented  by  the Federal  Administration  Office.  Since  1993  the  Federal  Administration  Office distinguishes between ethnic Germans (according to § 4 (1) of the federal refugee law) and spouses or relatives of ethnic Germans (according to § 7 (2) and 8 (2) of the federal refugee law) who are not ethnic Germans themselves in its registration procedure. In the year  1993  a  comparatively  high  percentage  (74%)  of  the  ethnic  German  immigration had been of ethnic German minority descent. In the year 2002 this percentage had gone back to 21% (see figure 6).

 Figure 6

 Network  theory  has  shown  that  immigrants  become  less  selective  in  socioeconomic terms  and  more  representative  of  the  sending  communities  as  the  migration  networks expand  and  the  costs  and  risks  of  migration  fall  (Massey  et  al.  1993:  450).  It  seems reasonable  to  argue  that  such  a  development  also  manifests  itself  in  the  case  of  the recent  ethnic  German  immigration,  approximating  the  socio-demographic  background of  the  immigrant  population  to  the  ethnic  minority  communities  in  the  sending countries.

 3. The integration path of ethnic Germans: economy, society and networks

 The  integration  of  ethnic  Germans  from  Eastern  Europe  and  the  former  Soviet  Union has been considered a kind of success story for nearly four decades. It has been shown in  several  studies  that  the  absorption  of  this  group  into  the  German  labor  market  and

 society proceeded with comparatively little frictions until the end of the eighties (KlÃ¶s 1992, Rudolph 1994: 117, Koller 1994). In the subsequent years this situation changed, confronting ethnic Germans with substantial integration difficulties (Seifert 1996, Bauer

 9

 and  Zimmermann  1997b,  Koller  1997,  Greif  et  al.  1999).  In  the  following  this development will be studied, focussing on the characteristics and likely determinants of the recent absorption process.

 3.1. Integration into the economy: increasing frictions?

 Integration  into  the  economy  usually  is  defined  in  terms  of  equal  opportunities  for natives  and  immigrants  with  respect  to  labor  market  access  and  income  positions. Consequently the fundamental questions assessing labor market integration are whether immigrants gain incomes similar to those of comparable natives and whether they face a similar unemployment risk.

 When evaluating the income positions of native and ethnic Germans the latter are found in  an  unfavorable  position:  on  the  average  they  earn  about  25%  less  than  natives  and they  more  often  perform  unskilled  jobs,  although  their  qualification  is  comparable  to that  of  natives  (Kreyenfeld  and  Konietzka  2002).  An  analysis  of  income  determinants shows  that  the  earnings  of  ethnic  Germans  positively  depend  on  professional  training and qualification, however more than half of this group does not work in the profession they are qualified for (Kreyenfeld and Konietzka 2002).6 Consequently, in many cases

 the positive impact of skills does not materialize. In addition, only those ethnic Germans are  expected  to  achieve  incomes  close  to  natives  who  bring  along  good  or  very  good German  language  competencies.  This  is  especially  true  for  all  skilled  professions, particularly  in  the  service  sector.  Furthermore  studies  discovered  that  ethnic  German immigrants who did not receive help from their relatives and friends in finding a job had a  significantly  lower  income  than  those  who  could  rely  on  assistance  by  migrant networks (Seifert 1996, Bauer and Zimmermann 1997b, Koller 1997: 779).

 In  job  search,  ethnic  Germans  highly  depend  on  German  language  proficiency,  on qualification and on the profession they have worked in before migration. The chances to  find  a  job  were  significantly  lower  for  ethnic  Germans  who  had  little  German language  skills  and  who  had  no  qualification  or  training.  Professions  with  different profiles in market systems and transition economies, for example jobs in administration, trade, banking, technology or education, denote a special employment risk. On the other hand  integration  assistance  by  the  German  government  supported  the  labor  market integration of ethnic Germans to a considerable degree (KlÃ¶s 1992, Barabas et al. 1992, Zimmermann 1994), although its impact decreased over time.

 According  to  labor  office  statistics  and  empirical  studies  the  unemployment  of  ethnic Germans is higher than that of natives, but lower than that of foreigners in Germany.7 In analyzing the unemployment risks of ethnic Germans, empirical studies point to sending country  determinants.  Ethnic  Germans  who  come  from  the  former  Soviet  Union  and from  Poland are more likely to  become unemployed  than those from  Romania (Bauer and  Zimmermann  1997b).  This  is  explained  by  language  competency,  education  and

 

 6  The  cited  study  (Kreyenfeld/Konietzka  2002)  refers  to  data  on  ethnic  Germans  who  had  come  to Germany between 1984 and 1994 (German socio-economic panel, see footnote 9). It might be suspected that the income position of ethnic Germans, who immigrated thereafter are even worse.

 7  The data of the German socio-economic panel indicate that 18% of the ethnic German work force had been unemployed in 1998. In the German workforce, the unemployment rate amounted to 10.1%, and in the foreign workforce to 19.6%.

 training  and  by  the  integration  into  sending  country  networks.  Network  related settlement  behavior  has  concentrated  ethnic  Germans  from  Romania  in  Bavaria  and Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg,  where  a  lower  unemployment  rate  prevails  compared  to  Lower-Saxonia and Northrhine-Westfalia, with higher unemployment rates, where many ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union live.

 3.2. Integration into the society: path towards segmentation?

 In  contrast  to  foreigners,  ethnic  Germans  were  expected  to  bring  along  language competencies  and  cultural  as  well  as   religious  practices  similar  to  those  of  native Germans.  In  addition  to  the  state  supported  social  integration  program  this  was supposed to guarantee a smooth absorption into the German society.

 The considerations above were in line with theoretical concepts, going back to the work of  Gordon  (1964)  and  later  writings  (Alba  1997:  829).  Here  the  most  important categories in the definition of social integration are acculturation—meaning the ability of migrants  or minorities  to  adapt  to  the language and  culture of the host  society, and socio-structural  integration—indicating  the  entrance  of  immigrants  into  the  social neighborhoods and institutions of the host country (Gordon 1964: 80). âAs described in innumerable  academic  and  journalistic  writings,  the  expectation  is  that  foreigners  and their offspring will first acculturate and then seek entry and acceptance from the native-born  population  as  a  prerequisite  for  their  social  and  economic  advancement“  (Portes 1995: 251). In Gordon’s and many other scholars’ view, the first step of acculturation does  not  necessarily  lead  to  other  forms  of  social  integration  into  the  host  society. Immigrants or minority groups may acculturate but still not take part in institutions or social neighborhoods of the receiving society, nor get into closer contact with the native population.

 Whereas ethnic Germans mastered acculturation more or less successfully until the end of  the  eighties,  the  socio-structural  integration  did  not  proceed  without  problems. Already  in  the  seventies  and  eighties  social  contacts  of  ethnic  Germans  were  often constrained  to  family  members  or  friends  from  the  sending  countries.  Participation  in German organizations, institutions or neighborhoods was rare. But unlike expellees and

 refugees,  who  established  effective  (political)  pressure  groups  in  post-war  Germany, ethnic German immigrants have not been greatly engaged in establishing organizations to pursue their interests. The most important organizations of ethnic German immigrants are countrymen affiliations, which have first of all been founded to preserve the history and  the  cultural  traditions  of  ethnic  German  minorities.  Typically,  countrymen affiliations  are  organized  according  to  former  (historical)  homelands,  such  as  the affiliation  of  Germans  from  Bessarabia,  Silesia  or  Russia.  Only  in  recent  years  the affiliation of Germans from Russia has put more emphasis on supporting the integration of  German  immigrants.  It  is  noteworthy,  however,  that  countrymen  affiliations  could not attract a high number of members. Although  1,6  million  ethnic  Germans  from  the former Soviet Union moved to Germany between 1989 and the end of 1999, their most important  pressure  group—the  affiliation  of  Germans  from  Russia—only  grew  by

 11

 17,660  members  in  this  time  span.8  Other  organizations,  funded  by  ethnic  German immigrants to provide legal, cultural, religious or social support, are of much lower and mostly only regional importance.

 Since the beginning of the nineties a slower acculturation path than in previous decades and  a  lack  of  socio-structural  adaptation  has  been  noticed  for  ethnic  German immigrants. Parallel to this development, recent ethnic Germans tended to build up and participate  in  migrant  networks,  which  have  often  been  identified  as  the  decisive support  for  the  development  of  a  separate  immigrants  community  or  subsociety.  This development  refers  to  a  newly  debated  issue  in  integration  theory,  focusing  on  the anticipated  outcome  of  social  integration.  In  most  theories  social  integration  refers  to the  adaptation  of  immigrants  to  the  middle-class  cultural  pattern  of  the  host  country (Alba  1997:  832).  However,  many  societies  vary  considerably  by  social  classes  and many include immigrant or minority cultures or even subsocieties. A recently developed analytical concept, the theory of segmented assimilation, has undertaken to formulate an alternative framework of immigrants adaptation in the context of a society consisting of segregated  cultures  or  communities  (Zhou  1997:  984).  Consequently,  the  theory  of segmented  assimilation  asks  into  which  specific  segments  of  the  receiving  society  a respective immigrant group integrates (Portes 1995, Portes and Zhou 1993, Zhou 1997). In  the  following,  this  framework  will  be  used  to  explore  the  acculturation  and  socio-structural  absorption  of  recent  ethnic  German  immigrants  in  Germany,  asking  if  this group tends to integrate into the language, culture and institutions of the German core society or if it first of all addresses ethnic German immigrant networks or communities.

 To examine the social integration pattern of ethnic Germans, data of the German socio-economic panel (GSOEP) will be used.9 If one looks at the most important indicator for acculturation,  the  proficiency  and  use  of  the  host  societys  language,  the  data  of  the GSOEP  (1997)  reveal  that  nearly  all  ethnic  German  immigrants  from  Romania  had  a good or very good command of the German language, compared to only 61.1% of those from  Poland  and  58.9%  from  the  former  Soviet  Union.  It  is  remarkable,  that  ethnic German immigrants from Poland and the former USSR expressed a higher proficiency in the Polish and Russian language than in German (see table 1). This language profile also  has  an  impact  on  German  language  use  in  daily  life,  where  79.2%  of  ethnic Germans from Romania but less than half of those from Poland and approximately half of  ethnic  Germans  from  the  former  Soviet  Union  spoke  predominantly  German.  This clearly  confirms  that  a  fast  acculturation  of  recent  ethnic  German  immigrants— especially of the most important group from the former Soviet Union—can no longer be taken for granted.

 Table 1

 

 8  The  membership  figure  increased  from  9,300  in  1989  to  26,440  in  1999  (information  by  the affiliation of Germans from Russia). 9

  The data set employed here stems from the immigrant sample of the German socio-economic panel (GSOEP).  The  immigrant  sample  was  added  to  the  GSOEP  to  study  the  consequences  of  the  new immigration  to  Germany  since  the  end  of  the  eighties.  In  the  immigrant  sample  ethnic  Germans  were included, who had moved to Germany between 1984 and 1994 (Burghauser et al. 1996). The distribution of ethnic Germans according to former home countries  reflects  the  distribution  of  sending  areas  in  this period  of  time.  An  extensive  comparison  with  official  data  reveals  that  the  sample  can  be  treated  as representative for the recent ethnic German immigrant population (Bauer and Zimmermann 1997b).

 12

 In  a  further  step  the  socio-structural  integration,  which  is  mostly  defined  in  terms  of friendship  relations  and  institutional  inclusions  in  the  host  country,  will  be  explored. The GSOEP reveals close friendship ties of ethnic Germans to former countrymen: for nearly  40%  of  German  immigrants,  the  three  best  friends  came  from  the  former homelands and 72.4% had at least one friend from the sending country. Ethnic Germans from  the  former  Soviet  Union  are  especially  involved  in  home  country  friendship circles.  This  points  to  the  important  role  of  migrant  relations  and  networks  built  on personal  ties.  The  meeting  frequency  with  relatives  and  friends  and  the  time  spent  in helping  relatives  and  friends  can  be  used  as  a  further  indicator  to  evaluate  social integration.  The  GSOEP  survey  found  ethnic  Germans  heavily  engaged  in  meeting (92%)  and  helping  (52%)  their  relatives  and  friends  on  a  weekly  or  monthly  base.  In comparison  to  the  native  born  Germans,  of  whom  80%  meet  and  42%  help  their relatives  and  friends  weekly  or  monthly  according  to  the  GSOEP,  the  personal relationships  of  ethnic  German  immigrants  are  stronger.  Next  to  friendships,  the institutional inclusion of ethnic German immigrants is of importance for the evaluation of their socio-structural integration. In the literature on this subject, no indication exists that  recent  ethnic  German  immigrants  engage  in  political,  social  or  neighborhood associations in Germany to a remarkable degree. This has been confirmed by the data of the GSOEP. Only 6.5% of ethnic German immigrants participate in social, political or neighborhood  associations  on  a  weekly  or  monthly  base.  Because  of  the  intense involvement of ethnic Germans in countrymen friendship networks, it may be assumed that these associations are related to ethnic German immigrant issues.

 Next it will be examined more deeply whether ethnic German immigrants develop and use networks after they have entered Germany and what this might imply for the social integration of this group. In  the absorption process  itself  networks  are  usually  seen  as formal  or  informal  ties  through  which  information  and  other  resources  are  distributed and channeled (Gurak and Caces 1992: 150,  Lucassen  and  Lucassen  1997).  Networks can take on various forms, which range from family and friendship relations to formal organizations.  With  regard  to  the  integration  into  the  receiving  societies,  research literature  identifies  basically  two  ways  in  which  migrant  networks  may  function. Migration  networks  can  provide  adaptive  support  in  finding  employment,  housing  or social  information.  This  mostly short-term  assistance  may also  have  a  positive  impact on  the  long-term  integration  into  the  receiving  society.  On  the  other  hand,  migrant networks  may  work  in  the  opposite  direction,  isolating  immigrants  in  limiting  their contacts  to  their  own  group  and  keeping  them  distant  from  the  indigenous  population and  from  organizations  and  institutions  of  the  receiving  society.  In  the  longer  run, migrant enclaves may develop, which often indicate economic disintegration and social segmentation.

 A valuable indicator for the development of migrant networks is the spatial distribution of immigrant populations. In the case of ethnic Germans the settlement after arrival has been  influenced  to  a  considerable  degree  by  the  wish  to  live  close  to  relatives  and friends from the same country of origin (Hofmann et al. 1992, Dietz 1995: 162, MÃ¼nz and Ohliger 1998: 177). Official data on the distribution of ethnic German immigrants into  the  German  LÃ¤nder  demonstrate  this.  Ever  since,  the  German  authorities  have distributed ethnic German immigrants according to a quota system throughout Germany to  achieve  some  burden  sharing  on  the  local  community  level.  If  one  looks  at  the

 13

 settlement behavior of ethnic Germans between 1989 and 1999, significant differences can  be  observed  with  respect  to  countries  of  origin  (see  table  2).10  Whereas  ethnic Germans  from  Romania  overfullfilled  the  quota  for  Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg  and  Bavaria, those  from  Poland  predominantly  moved  to  Northrhine-Westfalia.  In  return,  ethnic German  immigrants  from  the  former  Soviet  Union  preferred  Lower  Saxonia  and Northrhine-Westfalia. All in all this settlement behavior is evidence for the formation of migrant networks.

 Table 2

 The question whether the settlement behavior and the participation of ethnic Germans in migrant  networks  has  led  to  enclaves  and  a  certain  degree  of  segregation  can  not  be discussed  without  looking  at  the  German  housing  policy.  In  the  beginning  of  the nineties,  French,  Canadian  and  U.S.  troops  were  withdrawn  from  German  territory, leading to free housing space. In cases where the German authorities were in charge of these  housing  facilities,  they  often  used  them  to  accommodate  ethnic  German immigrants. In cases where housing space of withdrawing troops was offered on the free market, ethnic German immigrant families frequently rented them to live close to their relatives  and  friends  who  had  already  moved  to  the  state  supported  housing.  In  some cities  and  communities  this  contributed  to  a  considerable  segregation  of  recent  ethnic Germans (MÃ¼nz and Ohliger 1998: 177).

 The  growing  spacial  segregation  of  ethnic  Germans  has  been  accompanied  by  a tendency to withdraw from German institutions and neighborhoods. In many cases the increasing  xenophia  of  native  Germans  in  recent  years  enforce  this  tendency.  As  a result, ethnic German immigrants—first of all those who came from the former Soviet Union  in  the  nineties—form  predominantly  Russian  speaking  communities,  where many newcomers integrate. In  recent years  the  bi-cultural  background  of  many ethnic Germans additionally sustain a framework for integration, where the Russian language and major elements of previous cultural practices are actively retained.

 Summary

 It  has  been  shown  in  this  paper  that  the  integration  path  of  ethnic  Germans  was characterized  by  a  structural  break  in  the  end  of  the  eighties.  In  contrast  to  the comparatively  smooth  integration  of  this  group  before  the  political  transformation  in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union serious problems in the absorption process could be identified thereafter. To a certain degree this came as a surprise: the German minority background of this immigrant group and the strong assistance by the German government had anticipated a fast integration into the German economy and society.

 In  referring  to  basic  arguments  of  integration  theories  the  paper  pointed  at  the  most important  determinants,  explaining  the  changing  integration  path  of  ethnic  German immigrants.  Although  a  comparatively  privileged  admission  of  ethnic  Germans  still

 

 10  The  Federal  Administration  Office  usually  allows  ethnic  Germans  to  denote  the  preferred  Land where they want to live. In most cases new ethnic German immigrants are sent there, as long as the quota is not filled. Otherwise ethnic German immigrants have to move to the Land the Federal Administration Office denotes, if they do not want to loose governmental integration assistance.

 14

 prevailed  in  the  nineties,  entrance  barriers  have  been  erected  to  constrain  the immigration of this group. Nevertheless, because of the opening up of Eastern Europe and  because  of  the  development  of  migrant  networks,  the  immigration  of  ethnic Germans  increased  considerably  until  a  new  admission  law  came  into  force  in  1993. Consequently the new legal admission procedure and network dynamics had an effect on  sending  country  and  human  capital  characteristics  of  ethnic  German  immigrants. Whereas  the  1993  admission  law  basically  constrained  this  immigration  to  ethnic Germans  from  the  former  USSR,  network  dynamics  made  the  social  and  cultural background  of  immigrants  more  similar  to  that  of  the  German  minority  population  in

 the sending countries. As a result the German language competence of ethnic Germans, coming  predominantly  from  the  former  USSR,  decreased  and  the  share  of  bi-cultural families in that migration grew.

 Because  the  education,  qualification  and  training  of  ethnic  Germans  from  the  former Soviet Union is less compatible to the German labor market than that of ethnic Germans from  Poland  and  Romania, their economic integration  became more difficult  in  recent years. This process was enforced by cuts in governmental integration assistance, which have  been  implemented  as  a  result  of  policy  changes.  If  one  looks  at  the  social integration  of  ethnic  Germans  segmented  assimilation  can  increasingly  be  observed, indicating  the  growing  importance  of  ethnic  German  minority  enclaves  and communities. In the light of policy considerations, focusing on the ethno-national aspect of  the  ethnic  German  immigration,  this  might  have  been  unexpected.  In  the  light  of integration premises, focusing on migrants characteristics, the structure of the receiving society and on network dynamics, it is not.
