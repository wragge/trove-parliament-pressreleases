 SHAYNE NEUMANN MP 

 SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR    

 LABOR’S ASYLUM SEEKER POLICY 

 

 Labor’s policy on asylum seekers is clear. Labor will never let the people smugglers  back in business.    

 Labor believes in strong borders, offshore processing, regional resettlement and boat  turn backs when it is safe to do so because we know it saves lives at sea.    

 This is the policy agreed on at the ALP National Conference in 2015, the policy we took  to the 2016 Federal election and our ongoing position.    

 Manus Island and Nauru were set up as regional transit processing facilities but have  become places of indefinite detention under the Abbott-Turnbull Government.    

 The Government has been woeful in finding third country resettlement options for those  residing in offshore centres, putting all its eggs in one basket with not a single refugee  yet being resettled under the deal with the United States.    

 Instead of bragging about his new job, Peter Dutton needs to get on with his current job  and secure other third country resettlement options.
