  Doorstop  

 BRENDAN O'CONNOR:   In light of the incident that occurred on a Delta airline on its way to the United States  this week, the Federal Government believes its important to remind travellers coming  in and out of Australia that the Australian Government working closely with state and  territorian governments are responding to the Beale Review recommendation to  provide an all-in model policing arrangement for 11 major airports in this country.    

  We have a strong security arrangement in place in these major airports. This new  model providing sworn Australian Federal Police officers will make airports even  more secure and that is very important at a time when we have emerging threats, we  are combating terrorism and other recent threats to the security of this country.    

 QUESTION:   So minister is it correct that there's actually no policy changes or security changes in  Australia as a result of the US incident?    

 BRENDAN O'CONNOR:   Just before Christmas I made an announcement responding to an audit of police  capabilities undertaken by Roger Beale. That audit was undertaken commencing  January this year and was complete very late this year.    

 As a result of that review, the Federal Government considered its recommendations,  one of which, and a fundamental recommendation to that report was to consider the  way in which our major airports, our security arrangements were put in place.    

 Currently we have a unified policing model allowing for the police officers across all  jurisdictions, federal, state and territory working in those major airports. We consider  that it's now appropriate to implement the recommendation that would allow for an  all-in model. That would be a change to the current arrangements ensuring that there  would be sworn Australian Federal Police officers at all 11 major airports. We will, of  course, still continue to work very closely with our state counterparts, the state police  jurisdictions in combating terrorism and serious and organised crime. But we believe  having sworn Australian Federal Police officers in the 11 airports will provide a more  coordinated approach, will ensure a rapid response to emerging threats in our  airports.    

 QUESTION:  

 Is it correct that the all-in model was accepted by the Government before Christmas  and is it the case that there's actually no - the Government's not proposing any  changes as a result of the Christmas Day incident in the US?    

 BRENDAN O'CONNOR:    We've actually made very clear that we take terrorist threats very seriously.  That's why there's been very strong, security arrangements in place in our 11 major  airports. That will continue to be the case, but it is also the case that the Government  is responding to the Beale Review. This is the most systematic, fundamental  consideration of police capabilities for many a year, and as a result of that review, the  Government has responded to the recommendation to ensure that over a three to  five year period we have in place an all-in model which will provide better  coordination as I've said, insofar as the police are concerned across jurisdictions. It  will enable some of the complexities that currently exist to disappear providing a  more rapid response to emerging threats including any potential terrorist threats.    

 This government takes terrorism and terrorist threats very seriously, and as a result,  we've responded very quickly to the Beale Review recommendation to secure our  major airports with an all-in model approach.    

 QUESTION:   And will the AFP need to have a bigger budget and will it need to recruit more officers  over the next five years to implement this policy?    

 BRENDAN O'CONNOR:   The Australian Federal Police has a budget of almost $1.4 billion. This financial year,  the Federal Police budget has increased by more than $100 million and we consider  that these arrangements can be undertaken by saving through savings efficiencies.    

 The facts are that we believe that whilst there are strong security arrangements in  place at our major airports, there's no doubt if we are able to have sworn Australian  Federal Police officers at all major airports, at the 11 major airports in this country,  we will see better coordination across jurisdictions, a more rapid response to any  particular threats that might arise and for that reason we will implement the  recommendation of the Beale Review in order to ensure that we make our strong  security arrangements even stronger.    

 QUESTION:   Does this mean for the average traveller, will they know any difference?    

 BRENDAN O'CONNOR:    It's important that we ensure that our airports are secure. It's important,  therefore, that the Government makes clear to the Australian people and those other  travellers who use our airports that we were doing everything we possibly can to  mitigate against or prevent any potential threat turning into any possible disaster and  we are making it very clear today, as we've done before, that we are embarking upon  significant changes in close consultation with state and territory governments to 

 make our airports more secure.    

 We believe that the average traveller, of course, are already increasingly more  vigilant in the way in which they travel. The average traveller understands that  sometimes it takes more time to go through the security processes than was the case  a decade ago.    

 We live in a different world; we have more complex and emerging threats, and as a  result, our policing capabilities at the major airports must be as good as they possibly  can be.    

 This all-in model will provide a more effective approach, providing better  coordination, a more rapid response for those police officers and other agencies  across all jurisdictions.    

 QUESTION:   What strategy is in place to recruit those extra Federal Police, and are you making  any headway?    

 BRENDAN O'CONNOR:   We've made a commitment to increase the sworn officers in the Australian Federal  Police over a five-year period. We've already increased Australian, sworn Australian  Federal Police officers and we'll continue to seek to recruit Australian Federal Police  officers over that period.    

 Additionally of course, we can provide opportunities for police in other jurisdictions to  work with and in the Australian Federal Police Force.    

 So there are a number of ways in which we can ensure we have sufficient sworn  offices to provide the security we need at these airports.    

 QUESTION:   Minister, it's emerged that this Nigerian terrorist actually was involved in a  Wollongong university and studying at the Dubai campus. What do you have to say  about that?    

 BRENDAN O'CONNOR:   Look, I've heard of those particular reports that at a campus in Dubai, this particular  alleged terrorist was in fact studying there. It's yet been confirmed to me, but as I  understand, the allegation goes to a location in Dubai. And of course, we will  examine that matter and see if it has any particular implications, and indeed, of  course, we would provide relevant information to our US counterparts.    

 QUESTION:   If that's the case though, do we need to improve the way we screen students from  our overseas campuses?    

 BRENDAN O'CONNOR:   Well again, as I've said, I've heard of the reports. That has yet to be confirmed to me.  What we need to do, of course, is ensure that we work very closely with our  counterparts in the United States and our friends around the world.    

 This security - this security issue I'm discussing today, the emerging threats that are  occurring potentially around the world are as a result of a whole range of issues,  including of course the increase in terrorism. And it's for that reason we have to work  closely with our friends and agencies in the United States, the United Kingdom,  Europe and indeed within our own region.    

 And we'll continue to build those links and improve upon them as we are looking to  work closely with state and territorian governments here to move from a unified  policing arrangement in our airports to an all-in model ensuring we have sworn  officers of the Australian Federal Police in our 11 major airports. 

 

 QUESTION:   Minister, the AFP has gained a bit of a reputation for bungling in recent years, and I  know that your party, the Labor Party, was very critical of its performance over the  Haneef case, for example.    

 Why should travellers be confident now that the AFP is going to have total charge of  their security at Australian airports?    

 BRENDAN O'CONNOR:   As minister responsible for the Australian Federal Police, I can only say that that  police force is exemplary. It is a professional outfit with dedicated officers who will  provide Australians and travellers in those airports the best possible security.    

 I have nothing but praise for those officers and their role and their important and  sometimes dangerous role in securing our citizens and travellers to this country. And  I believe it's important therefore that as we move from a unified policing model to an  all-in model, we work closely not only with the Australian Federal Police directly but  with them and their counterparts, the police in states and territories, who also have a  high level of expertise and an array of skills, because even by moving to this model,  we will still have to work very closely with state and territorian police to combat  serious and organised crime and to tackle terrorism.    

 This is a threat that requires the efforts of all agencies, both at home and abroad.     

 QUESTION:   Just on the 255 Tamils in the Port of Merak in Indonesia, is Australia interested in  taking some of those asylum seekers?    

 BRENDAN O'CONNOR:   Australia is a resettlement country and therefore will of course always consider  requests, particularly those that are made through the UNHCR. We look to resettle  where we can genuine refugees. We have a threshold of 13,750 providing an  opportunity for people to be settled in this country. And we, along with Canada, the  United States, New Zealand, Sweden, United Kingdom and other countries, will of  course consider such requests for settling genuine asylum seekers.    

 But as for whether in fact there's been any consideration to date, as we've made  clear all along, this was a vessel that left Malaysia, was intercepted by an Indonesian  vessel. It is incumbent now upon those passengers to disembark that vessel so that  the UNHCR can properly process their claims.     

 Ultimately, this of course, this whole arrangement and this matter is something that  has to be undertaken and dealt with by the Indonesian authorities.    

 QUESTION:  Thank  you.     

 BRENDAN O'CONNOR: Thanks.
