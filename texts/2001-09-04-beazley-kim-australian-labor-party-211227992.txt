 Kim Beazley - Doorstop Interview Subjects: Interception Of Dangerous Mail To MPs, Immigration, Tampa Federal Court Case, Macfarlane And The Liberal Party's GST Avoidance Scam, Free Trade Agreement

 Transcript - South Perth, WA - 4 September 2001

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY

 BEAZLEY: This incident [mail interception] shows that the immigration issue in our community can take on an ugly dimension. It has the potential to be deeply divisive. That's why bipartisanship is so essential. We need a decent immigration program for national development, as well as humanitarian reasons. We can only get that where the two parties set out on the basis that they try to agree. A week or two ago the Government said we agree on 90 per cent of the issues related to immigration. It's just the 10 per cent we disagree on. Well, on those 10 per cent we have to sit down and nut our way through to arrive at decent conclusions on them. We need that migration program and we need the unity of our people. And those who stir up disunity in our community both diminish our reputation internationally and make for an incoherent community domestically. It's the job of us in politics to make sure that all that potential is minimised.

 JOURNALIST: Are you worried about your security and that of your staff?

 BEAZLEY: I'm worried about my staff always. They've had a pretty ugly week, frankly, in the questions that have been directed at them and the abuse that they've had. And all that has done for all of us is to emphasise the absolute requirement here that on a program so vital to the future of our nation we need bipartisanship.

 JOURNALIST: Isn't it true that members of your Caucus thought that the Prime Minister should have been opposed from the beginning?

 BEAZLEY: Our position has been absolutely razor straight. We have stood on principle from day one and the principle we stood on first was that international law in relation to sea rescue should be adhered to and the Prime Minister's diplomacy was inadequate to deal with that problem. Then when the Bill was put into Parliament we said this is not a Bill that produces a resolution, this is a Bill that diminishes our international reputation and therefore is against the national interest. Now, I see today and yesterday Mr Howard is out there saying that his legal circumstances would be advanced by the Bill. They would not be. That is completely untrue. All that Bill related to was reinforcing a power to oblige a ship to exit

 Australian territorial waters. It covered nothing about transit arrangements associated with the sort of transfer which has occurred to send to a safe haven the refugees on this boat. That, in fact, is what we offered Mr Howard in the interest of bipartisanship at the time and that is what he rejected.

 JOURNALIST: But many members of your own Caucus thought he should have been opposed from the beginning.

 BEAZLEY: The members of my Caucus are united behind us. There are always views here and there, but the views we expressed right through that week were the views of the overwhelming majority of people in our Caucus as reflected in the Caucus resolution. And understand this: we're standing on principle. The essence of a good migration program is good laws. The essence of decent international relationships associated with it is that everybody conforms with their obligations. And the task last week was to get others to conform with theirs. But the diplomacy wasn't there. It's all been done now too late, too late. Now, that's what we stood for. When what was brought into the House had no means within it to resolve the issues but were very bad in principle and would have damaged our interest internationally and therefore was against the national interest, we opposed that. But we also had a constructive solution. And we offered the constructive solution to the Government and they spurned that. And that constructive solution was to get a Tampa-based outcome that involved a safe haven for the people onboard the Tampa and the Prime Minister said we'll have none of it.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, if we're talking about the parcels that have arrived, what do you think the perpetrators are trying to say?

 BEAZLEY: Well, the perpetrators are criminals. You need to understand that. And what they are saying is that they are criminals. And what we are saying is that these are issues that can be very divisive in our community and, because they can be divisive in our community, we need bipartisanship. We've stood for that all week and I'm proud of the stands we've taken.

 JOURNALIST: What about public opinion, Mr Beazley? According to this morning's polls, it seems to be swinging behind Mr Howard.

 BEAZLEY: We've always said that this is going to be a hard-fought election. As the election gets closer, of course, all the issues that are out there that concern people - family living standards, education, health, tax - they'll all be out there as the issues which will dominate the polls. We've never pretended it would be anything other than a hard fight. But I can assure you of this: irrespective of what the polls say from week to week on the issues of great national importance like our immigration program, you can expect from me, irrespective of the polls, a principled stand.

 JOURNALIST: Was Labor's position on the Tampa poll driven?

 BEAZLEY: Labor's position on the Tampa was principle driven. The principle that if you're going to have in place decent arrangements to deal with refugee problems, with immigration problems, then all sides, all people need to play their part in ensuring that that occurs. And where you have an international obligation, you observe it. When the whole show started the Government had upon itself the task of diplomatically resolving that and failed. And they thrashed about solutions from that point on. They came up with a non-solution. We opposed that non-solution again on principle. But we made an offer -again on principle - that would have resolved the problem for the Government at that point of time. They chose to reject it.

 JOURNALIST: Has the Tampa incident cost you victory?

 BEAZLEY: The polls will bounce around and, from my point of view, in politics what you do is this: you put forward your principles, you relate your policies to those principles and you fight for them. If the public goes with you, they go with you and then you can form a decent coherent government. If they don't, well that's that. But my view is that we can win this election. We'll win it on the policies we put forward and we'll win it, at the end of the day, because we actually take a stand on the issues that need to have a stand taken on them - popular or otherwise - and we are out there in this particular issue for a bipartisan solution and we always will be.

 JOURNALIST: Do you agree public opinion is behind Mr Howard on this one?

 BEAZLEY: Public opinion can change. The point about public opinion and international opinion is one thing, right solutions are another, and we stand for the right solutions, we stand for the principled solutions.

 JOURNALIST: Are you surprised that the Prime Minister's popularity has increased?

 BEAZLEY: In these set of circumstances, obviously not. But I still go back to the point that you are not going to get resolutions of these issues unless you take a bipartisan approach to it, a national approach. Polls come and go. All this poll indicates - or these various polls indicate because some of them indicate a different outcome - all these polls indicate is that it'll be a close, tough, hard-fought election. It'll be fought on a variety of issues and we'll be taking the stands on principle with the policies attached to them, which I believe, at the end of the day will appeal to the Australian public.

 JOURNALIST: What about the Federal Court case, Mr Beazley? It's coming up for a decision. Obviously, if the Commonwealth is defeated in it, Mr Howard will blame you for it.

 BEAZLEY: I don't comment on cases as they are proceeding. But I do notice the Prime Minister was not so restrained in relation to legislation. I've got to tell you this: that piece of legislation put in Parliament that would have done so much damage to our national interest would not have helped him one wit in the circumstances that he faces. That was about forcing a ship to exit. And he had the power to do that but he didn't do it. Why didn't he do it? Because an international situation - bad as it was then - would have become infinitely worse if you'd forced them out with nowhere to go. What did we do? We offered him instead of that a solution that would have allowed the people on the Tampa specifically to be moved to safe haven elsewhere. And he got up in Parliament and mocked us. The problem for the Prime Minister in that argument is that it's all there on the record. And every now and then those who comment on political life go back to the record and make their own judgements. And whatever smokescreen he might like to try and put up to the Australian public can always be exposed.

 JOURNALIST: So, will the result be a negative for you whichever way it goes?

 BEAZLEY: As far as I'm concerned, the court case is the court case and politicians should not try to influence or place pressure on the court by saying any particular outcome helps one way or another. What I do say is this: that Bill would not have helped him and anybody looking at it rationally would see that. That Bill would have done us a great deal of damage in the international community.

 JOURNALIST: There's still a couple of weeks of Federal Parliament to go and there's legislation involving the refugees in Parliament. I mean, how are you going to play that with some dissent on your

 own side?

 BEAZLEY: With principle. We are going to be out there seeking an agreement with the Government on all the legislation which is being put forward - as we always have been. As they said, we agree on 90 per cent of the things and disagree on 10 per cent. Well, we're going to hone in on that 10 per cent to seek agreement. What the Government chooses to do is a matter for the Government. But there'll be other issues in that particular Parliamentary sitting. We see, for example, in the last couple of days there's been more development on the Macfarlane-GST and Government - or Liberal Party - GST avoidance front, with the revelation that it was much more widespread than was originally thought and the revelation that Mr Macfarlane knew much more about it than he originally admitted to. These matters can be most effectively scrutinised in Parliament and they will be.

 JOURNALIST: Just going back to your earlier comments, you're saying bipartisan approach is needed on the immigration front. Do you believe that there is a middle ground on this?

 BEAZLEY: Of course. There has been for years. We need absolutely to get right immigration policy for this country. Why? Because it is so critical to our nation's future. Immigration has always been about nation building, as well as about humanitarian issues. And that is why governments and oppositions in the past have sought bipartisanship. We're going through a bad period now but we can get back on track. And what people need to know is that there's one political party in the process who's interested in achieving a bipartisan outcome and that's us. You know, we have seen the capacity of this to promote great ugliness in the Australian community but that's nothing new, that's been there for a long time. But if you seek to exploit it then the consequence of that is deeply damaging to the internal coherence of our community and the happiness of our people and appalling in relation to our international reputation. Now, we don't want to be diminished internationally, we're proud of our international reputation. And this has the potential to do that but it also has the potential to create a very good image of Australia and a very coherent and happy domestic community and that's what we're about.

 JOURNALIST: Mr Howard's off to Washington next week and one of the issues he was going to raise, I understand, was pushing the free trade issue. Now he's been advised not to push it too hard. I mean, what should he do, in your view?

 BEAZLEY: There are issues in that free trade arrangement. What Mr Howard has got to do is to address all those issues and to ensure that those in the Australian community who may have concerns about it have those concerns ameliorated or reassured. It may be in relation to our film industry, it may be in relation to our pharmaceutical industry or our car industry. And on the other side of the coin, or the other side of the ledger, there is the question of what the meaning of a free trade agreement is if it does not give access to American markets for agricultural products. There are difficult tough issues there and people need some reassurance from Mr Howard before they're put on the table.
