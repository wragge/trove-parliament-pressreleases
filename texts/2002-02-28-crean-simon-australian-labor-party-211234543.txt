 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

 CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY    EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY

 SPEECH BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THE HON SIMON CREAN LUNCHEON IN HONOUR OF HIS EXCELLENCY CHIEF OLUSEGUN OBASANJO

 PRESIDENT OF NIGERIA PARLIAMENT HOUSE CANBERRA 28 FEBRUARY 2002

 President Obasanjo, Prime Minister and Mrs Howard, my Parliamentary colleagues, your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

 I would like to join with the Prime Minister in warmly welcoming the President of Nigeria and his delegation to Australia.

 Earlier today, President Obasanjo and I had the opportunity to discuss a range of matters, including Nigeria’s welcome return to democracy under his Presidency.

 President Obasanjo has been a leading advocate of democracy and good governance in Nigeria for many years  - indeed he was once jailed for his strong views on democratic rights.

 We meet at a time when African issues are very much to the fore of international attention.

 The pre-election situation in Zimbabwe, the ongoing conflict in the Great Lakes region and the continuing scourge of the HIV/AIDS pandemic are all issues that deserve close international scrutiny.

 Moreover, conflict continues to be a direct cause of mass people movements around the world. And conflict provides opportunities for organised criminal groups and terrorist networks to operate with a degree of impunity.

 The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which begins in two days time, will be a good opportunity to address some of these important issues.

 As I have argued elsewhere, Commonwealth leaders should use this opportunity to encourage universal adherence to the relevant international legal instruments on refugees and terrorism.

 Although Australia and Nigeria share only a modest economic relationship we share a broader set of goals concerning the promotion of human rights, good governance and the rule of law.

 Nigeria is to be commended for its leadership role among African countries in recent years in terms of addressing the equally important issues of trade, health, education and social development in Africa.

 In particular, I believe that multilateral initiatives, such as the New Partnership for African Development ï£§  in which President Obasanjo has played a key role ï£§  can be a force for positive change.

 Prime Minister Chretien of Canada has described the new partnership as ‘a good investment, an investment in our common future, in our collective security and common humanity’.

 I fully agree. And I look forward to seeing further progress on this initiative at the G-8 Summit in Canada in July.

 In an increasingly interdependent world, developed and developing countries need to work more closely to achieve outcomes that are both equitable and just.

 As September 11 and its aftermath have shown, there can be no secure future for any of us unless we manage globalisation with greater justice.

 As home to more than 110 million people ï£§  a sixth of Africa’s total population ï£§  Nigeria has a special role to play in leading Africa towards a more secure and prosperous future.

 Good leadership should be rewarded, and I wish President Obasanjo every success in his efforts to achieve a more stable, democratic future for Nigeria and for Africa as a whole.

 Finally, in welcoming President Obasanjo to Australia, can I say that I believe both countries have much to learn from each other.

 In particular, Mr President, I think the Australian soccer team ‘The Socceroos’ might be looking for some hints from Nigeria’s ‘Super Eagles’ in terms of how to get into the World Cup finals.

 I wish Nigeria every success and I look forward to the development of stronger relations between our two countries in the future.

 Ends.
