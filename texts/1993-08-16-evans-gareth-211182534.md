 NEWS RELEASE

 MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS A â¢

 SENATOR GARETH EVANS

 DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT : BANGLADESH

 The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, today announced the appointment of Mr Ken Aspinall as Australia's next High Commissioner to the People's Republic of Bangladesh.

 Mr Aspinall replaces Mr Richard Gate, who has been High Commissioner since September 1989.

 "Australia was one of the first countries to establish relations with Bangladesh when it became independent in 1971," Senator Evans said.

 "The two nations have since enjoyed a friendly and constructive relationship."

 Two—way trade for the 1992/93 financial year totalled approximately $86 million, with Australia's major exports being vegetables, dairy products, cereals and metals. Major imports from Bangladesh were clothing and textiles.

 In 1992/93 Australia continued to assist Bangladesh's development through an aid program worth approximately $16.5 million. This level is expected to be maintained in 1993/94.

 Mr Aspinall is a senior officer of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB). He has served with that organisation since 1973. He has carried responsibilities at senior management level in many areas of concern to AIDAB, being associated mainly with policy initiation and the delivery of Australia's aid program to

 developing countries around the world.

 Mr Aspinall has represented Australia at a number of international conferences concerned with development cooperation issues. In addition, he has been the principal AIDAB contact with DFAT and Austrade on trade issues related to the aid program. He is currently Assistant Director General, Community, Commercial and Refugee Programs Branch.

 Mr Aspinall will take up his position in November 1993.
