 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Thursday, 1 August 2013    

 First plane, Australia’s shame    

 The government’s refusal to consider policies that would actually save lives at sea while caring for  refugees is an attack on Australia’s sense of decency and commitment to the fair-go, the Australian  Greens have said.    

 “It's a sad day for fairness and decency,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young said.    

 “The government is storming ahead with this cruel policy that is an attack on Australia’s generous  heart and our global reputation.     

 “Everyone knows the conditions in the Manus island camp are horrid and inhumane, but it is clear  the government just doesn't care.     

 “Kevin Rudd is more interested in competing with Tony Abbott in the race to the bottom than  putting in place policies that will save lives and care for refugees.    

 “The government must rule out sending families and children to the malaria-riddled camp in PNG.  Manus Island will never be fit for children and the government knows it.     

 “The Greens’ policy of increasing intake and funding the assessment of refugees in Indonesia is a  better and humane way to stop people coming by boat and gives refugee families a fair go.”
