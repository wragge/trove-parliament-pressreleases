  SPEECH BY

  THE MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL 
AFFAIRS

  MR PHILIP RUDDOCK MP

  ON 8 JULY 1998 AT THE LAUNCH OF:

  

  THE DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL 
AFFAIRS’ CLIENT SERVICE CHARTER

  

  THE CHARTER OF PUBLIC SERVICE IN A CULTURALLY 
DIVERS  E 
SOCIETY

  

  THE INFORMATION KIT, AUSTRALIAN IMMIGRATION: THE FACTS

  

  Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

  TODAY IS THE FIRST STAGE IN A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN AIMED AT PUTTING SOME 
TRUTH BACK IN TO THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE AND SHOWING HOW MIGRATION BENEFITS 
ALL AUSTRALIANS.

  

  SER IOUSLY FLAWED INFORMATION IS BEING SPREAD ABOUT THE MIGRATION 
PROGRAM - AND IDEAS AND POLICIES ARE BEING CIRCULATED WHICH HAVE MORE 
TO DO WITH SLICK RHETORIC THAN SUBSTANCE.

  

  CLEARLY IN MANY CASES THE PEOPLE PROPAGATING THIS RHETORIC HAVE EITHER 
VERY LITTL E KNOWLEDGE OF HOW PROGRAMS WORK OR, AND PERHAPS MORE 
TO THE POINT - DON’T WANT TO KNOW.

  

  WHY LET THE FACTS STAND IN THE WAY OF A GOOD STORY.

  

  UNFORTUNATELY, SOME OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROPAGATING THESE MYTHS 
CONTINUE TO SPREAD MISINFORMATION AND WILFUL  DISTORTION OF THE 
FACTS WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNTABILITY.

  

 THESE MYTHS AND DISTORTIONS PREY ON COMMUNITY ANXIETIES 
AND CREATE UNNECESSARY FEAR OF AUSTRALIA’S MIGRATION PROGRAM AND THE 
GOOD PEOPLE WHO ARRIVE HERE TO MAKE AUSTRALIA THEIR HOME.

  

 SUCH DIVISIVE TACTICS SHOULD BE CONDEMNED AS UNAUSTRALIAN.

  

 I BELIEVE THAT PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD ON THE BASIS OF 
FACTUAL INFORMATION, OUR IMMIGRATION PROGRAM DOES HAVE THE SUPPORT OF 
MOST AUSTRALIANS.

  

 I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE LEVEL OF MISUNDERSTANDING 
IN THE GENERAL COMMUNITY IS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PAST MISMANAGEMENT.

  

  THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT FAILED TO BE OPENLY ACCOUNTABLE ABOUT THE 
NATURE AND BASIS OF OUR IMMIGRATION PROGRAM.

  

  THEY FAILED TO INFORM ALL AUSTRALIANS ABOUT THE IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL 
NATURE OF A PROPERLY FOCU SED MIGRATION PROGRAM.

  

  IN SO DOING, THEY FAILED THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA.

  

  SINCE I TOOK ON THIS JOB, I HAVE BEEN DETERMINED TO REVERSE THOSE 
TWO TRENDS.

  

  I HAVE ENSURED THAT ALL AVAILABLE DATA AND INFORMATION ABOUT AUSTRALIA’S 
MIGRATION PROGRAM IS WIDELY D ISTRIBUTED AND DISCUSSED IN NUMEROUS 
FORUMS —

  

  INCLUDING BY HOLDING TWO OF THE FIRST PUBLIC MEETINGS ON IMMIGRATION 
MATTERS EVER HELD IN THIS COUNTRY.

  

  AND I HAVE BEEN RESOLUTE IN PROMOTING THE BENEFITS OF PAST, PRESENT 
AND FUTURE MIGRATION TO THIS COUNTRY  —

  

  INCLUDING THE LAUNCH OF SEVERAL INFORMATION PACKAGES ON PRODUCTIVE 
DIVERSITY.

  

  I WILL CONTINUE THIS APPROACH.

  

  I WILL BE VISITING EVERY STATE AND TERRITORY TO LAUNCH THREE IMPORTANT 
INITIATIVES WHICH UNDERLINE THE GOVERNMENT’S COMMITMENT.

  

  THESE INITIA TIVES WILL HELP ENSURE THE PROTECTION AND SAFEKEEPING 
OF AUSTRALIA’S MIGRATION HERITAGE AND THE PRESENT REALITY OF ITS CULTURAL 
DIVERSITY.

  

 THESE PRODUCTS ARE MY DEPARTMENT’S CLIENT SERVICE 
CHARTER, THE CHARTER OF PUBLIC SERVICE IN A CULTURALLY DIVERSE SOCIETY 
AND THE INFORMATION KIT,   AUSTRALIAN IMMIGRATION THE FACTS .

  

 AMONG OTHER THINGS THEY WILL HELP ENSURE THAT NO AUSTRALIAN, 
WHATEVER THEIR BACKGROUND, HAS TO FACE ANY BARRIERS TO FULL PARTICIPATION 
IN OUR SOCIETY.

  

 THIS IS NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO 
DO — IT IS THE AUSTRALIAN WAY TO GIVE EVERYONE “A FAIR GO”.

  

 BY USING THE SKILLS AND EXPERTISE OF ALL AUSTRALIANS 
INCLUDING MIGRANTS, WE DEVELOP AS A NATION — BOTH SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY 
- IN WHICH ALL AUSTRALIANS CAN REAP THE BENEFITS.

  

 LET ME NOW TALK ABOUT THESE THREE PRODUCTS IN MORE 
DETAIL:

  

  THE CLIENT SERVICE CHARTER

  

 MY DEPARTMENT’S CLIENT SERVICE CHARTER WAS DEVELOPED 
TO ENSURE CLIENTS RECEIVE HIGH QUALITY SERVICE.

  

 THE CHARTER SETS OUT STANDARDS WHICH CLEARLY EXPLAIN 
WHAT CLIENTS CAN EXPECT FROM US AND WHAT, AS A DEPARTMENT, WE NEED FROM 
CLIENTS SO THAT WE CAN DO OUR JOB.

  

  THAT IS, TO DEAL WITH INQUIRIES AND APPLICATIONS IN AN INFORMATIVE, 
HELPFUL AND EFFICIENT MANNER AND WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION.

  

  A KEY ELEMENT OF THE NEW CHARTER HAS BE EN TO GIVE CLIENTS A 
VOICE:

  

  THEY WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS OR COMPLAINTS OR, FOR THAT MATTER, 
COMPLIMENT STAFF ON THE PROVISION OF GOOD SERVICE;

  

  WHILE CLIENTS WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO RESOLVE ISSUES WITH THE PERSON 
WHO PROVIDED THE SERVICE, IF THIS D OES NOT WORK THEY WILL BE 
ABLE TO TAKE THE MATTER UP WITH A COMPLAINTS OFFICER;

  

  THESE OFFICERS ARE BASED IN ALL STATES AND TERRITORIES AND AT MOST 
OVERSEAS POSTS.

  

  IMPORTANTLY, CLIENTS NEED TO KNOW THAT IF THEY MAKE A COMPLAINT IT 
WILL IN NO WAY IMPACT ON THE OUTCOME OF THEIR APPLICATION.

  

  CLIENTS ALSO NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE CHARTER D OES NOT DO, IN 
PARTICULAR IT DOES NOT GIVE CLIENTS ACCESS TO REVIEW OF UNFAVOURABLE 
DECISIONS.

  

 THE CHARTER IS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF SERVICE DELIVERY 
— NOT DECISION OUTCOMES.

  

  THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION.

  

  GOOD CLIENT SERVICE DOESN’T ALWAYS MEAN SA YING ‘YES’.

  

  IN FACT, IN ORDER TO DELIVER A BALANCED MIGRATION PROGRAM THAT IS 
IN AUSTRALIA’S BEST INTERESTS WE OFTEN HAVE TO SAY ‘NO’.

  

  BUT WHEN WE SAY ‘NO’, WE MUST DO SO IN A CLEAR AND COURTEOUS MANNER.

  

  AS A FINAL POINT, IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THA T SOME SERVICES 
ARE PROVIDED THROUGH THE PRIVATE OR COMMUNITY SECTORS.

  

  EVEN SO, THE GOVERNMENT REMAINS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE QUALITY OF ALL 
OF THESE SERVICES - SUCH AS ENGLISH LANGUAGE TUITION PROVIDED UNDER 
THE AMEP.

  

  WHILE THE STANDARDS FOR THESE SERVICES  ARE SET OUT IN THE CONTRACTS, 
COMPLAINTS ARRANGEMENTS STILL APPLY.

  

  I SEE THE DEPARTMENT’S NEW CHARTER AS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN BRINGING 
DOWN THE BARRIERS TO GOVERNMENT SERVICES OR FULL PARTICIPATION IN AUSTRALIAN 
LIFE.

  

  THE CHARTER OF PUBLIC SERVICE IN A CULTURALLY DIVERSE SOCIETY

  

 THE DEPARTMENT’S CHARTER IS LINKED TO A WHOLE OF 
GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT WHICH IS SET OUT IN THE CHARTER OF PUBLIC SERVICE 
IN A CULTURALLY DIVERSE SOCIETY.

  

 THIS CHARTER APPLIES TO THE WHOLE PUBLIC SERVICE AND 
AIMS TO ENSURE THAT ALL COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT SERVICES ARE RESPONSIVE 
TO THE NEEDS OF OUR CULTURALLY DIVERSE SOCIETY.

  

 ALREADY MANY FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS 
ARE PURSUING POLICIES AND PROGRAMS CONSISTENT WITH THIS CHARTER.

  

 AT THE COMMONWEALTH LEVEL THERE’S BEEN CONSIDERABLE 
PROGRESS IN ENSURING ALL GOVERNMENT SERVICES ARE PLANNED AND DELIVERED 
WITH THE NEEDS OF OUR CULTURALLY DIVERSE SOCIETY IN MIND.

  

 THIS WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH SPECIFIES THE VALUES 
AND STANDARDS OF CLIENT SERVICE THAT PEOPLE CAN EXPECT FROM PARTICULAR 
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.

  

  AUSTRALIAN IMMIGRATION THE FACTS

  

 THESE TWO CHARTERS ARE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ABOUT 
DELIVERING CONSISTENTLY HIGH QUALITY, PROFESSIONAL SERVICES IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY 
WAY.

  

  WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE THIRD AND FINAL PROD UCT - AUSTRALIAN 
IMMIGRATION THE FACTS - AND HOW IT SETS OUT SOME FACTUAL INFORMATION 
ABOUT OUR NONDISCRIMINATORY MIGRATION PROGRAM - SOMETHING AUSTRALIA 
SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF.

  

  IT MIGHT BE A TOUGH PROGRAM WITH STRICT OBJECTIVE CRITERIA. IT IS 
A PROGRAM  WITH HEALTH AND CHARACTER REQUIREMENTS.

  

 IT IS A PROGRAM THAT EMPHASISES SKILLS AND ENCOURAGES 
PEOPLE TO SETTLE IN REGIONAL AUSTRALIA.

  

 IT IS DEFINITELY A PROGRAM THAT SEEKS TO BENEFIT ALL 
AUSTRALIANS.

  

 AND IT IS A PROGRAM UNDER WHICH MIGRANTS COME TO AUSTRALIA 
TO REALISE THEIR DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS - TO CREATE WORK AND BUILD 
A NATION; TO GENERATE GOODWILL FOR INCREASED TOURISM; TO BENEFIT BUSINESS 
BY CREATING LINKS IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE WORLD.

  

 THE KIT I AM LAUNCHING TODAY SETS OUT THE FACTS ABOUT 
THESE ISSUES.

  

  IN RECENT TIMES, IT HAS BECOME DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO DISTINGUISH 
FACT FROM F1CTION IN THE DEBATE ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY.

  

  THIS CONCERNS ME, AND AS A RESULT I SOUGHT TO HAVE THE KIT I LAUNCHED 
LAST YEAR UPDATED SO THAT  I COULD DIRECTLY ADDRESS COMMUNITY 
CONCERNS.

  

 THE FIRST EDITION WAS A ‘SELL OUT’. OVER 15,000 
COPIES WERE DISTRIBUTED, AND EVEN NOW, THE KIT’S INTERNET SITE ALONE 
AVERAGES 800 ‘HITS’ PER WEEK.

  

 PEOPLE DO WANT TO KNOW THE FACTS.

  

 THIS NEW KIT ADDRESSES THE MYTHS THAT HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY 
GIVEN PUBLIC VOICE IN RECENT TIMES.

  

 IT SETS OUT THE FACTS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN MAKE INFORMED 
JUDGEMENTS ABOUT THE ISSUES.

  

 AND THESE ARE FACTS NOT AS THE GOVERNMENT SEES THEM 
—BUT THE FACTS AS THEY ARE.

  

  WHEN YOU READ SOME OF  THE MATERIAL SOME OF YOU WILL THINK I 
AM BEING TOO TOUGH AND OTHERS NOT TOUGH ENOUGH...WHAT THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO IS STRIKE A BALANCE.

  

  FOR EXAMPLE THERE HAS BEEN SOME DEBATE ABOUT THE NEED FOR MIGRANTS 
TO SPEAK ENGLISH.

  

  THE FACT IS T HAT 75 PER CENT OF MIGRANTS HAVE A HIGH LEVEL 
OF ENGLISH AND OF THOSE WHO DON’T MANY ARE IN FACT REFUGEES.

  

  MANY PEOPLE SEEM TO BELIEVE THAT MIGRANTS GO STRAIGHT ON TO WELFARE.

  

  WRONG. MIGRANTS CAN’T ACCESS WELFARE UNTIL THEY HAVE BEEN IN AUSTRALIA 
FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS. ONLY REFUGEES CAN CLAIM SUCH BENEFITS.

  

  THEN THERE IS THE DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER MIGRANTS AR E GOOD FOR 
AUSTRALIA.

  

  HERE ARE JUST SOME OF THE FACTS:

  

  EACH BUSINESS SKILLS MIGRANT CREATES, ON AVERAGE, SIX NEW JOBS AND 
INVEST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS;

  

  TOURISTS, SUCH AS FAMILY AND FRIENDS COME TO VISIT MIGRANTS HELPING 
TO GENERATE SOME $16 BILLION IN EXP ORT EARNINGS;

  

 TOURISTS ALSO CREATE JOBS 
FOR SOME 700,000 AUSTRALIANS;

  

 MIGRANTS HAVE MADE, AND 
CONTINUE TO MAKE, MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE FIELDS OF MEDICINE, SCIENCE, 
PRIMARY INDUSTRY, MINING, SPORT, EDUCATION, THE ARTS AND CULTURE AND 
BUSINESS.

  

  OUR HI GHLY TARGETED MIGRATION PROGRAM ENSURES AUSTRALIA BENEFITS 
FROM THE SKILLS, EXPERIENCE, NETWORKS AND SHEER ENTREPRENEURIAL ABILITIES 
OF MIGRANTS.

  

 THESE MIGRANTS ARE HELPING TO POSITION AUSTRALIA AS 
AN IMPORTANT PLAYER IN THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY, PARTICULARLY AS WE ENTER 
AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE 21ST CENTURY.

  

 I WOULD NOW LIKE TO MOVE TO THE LESS FORMAL PART OF 
THE AFTERNOON.

  

 IN 1987 FOUND1NG MEMBER OF THE FAMOUS SINGING GROUP 
THE SEEKERS AND AUSTRALIAN OF THE YEAR IN 1967, BRUCE WOODLEY, - WROTE 
THE SONG   I AM 
AUSTRALIAN .

  

  I UNDERSTAND FROM BRUCE THAT THE SONG STARTED WITH THE BELIEF THAT 
IT IS POSSIBLE TO TALK ABOUT NATIONAL UNITY  PARTICULARLY IN A 
COUNTRY WITH SUCH A DIVERSE ETHNIC BACKGROUND AS OURS.

  

  SINCE 1987 THE SONG HAS FOUND ITS WAY INTO THE HOMES  AND HEARTS 
OF MILLIONS OF AUSTRALIANS AND HAS BECOME PART OF COMMUNITY LIFE AND 
HELPED CREATE A DEEP SENSE OF BELONGING.

  

 WOULD YOU PLEASE WELCOME BRUCE WOODLEY, HIS DAUGHTER 
CLAIRE WOODLEY AND THE AUSTRALIAN YOUTH CHOIR TO SING FOR YOU   I AM AUSTRALIAN .

  

 THANK-YOU
