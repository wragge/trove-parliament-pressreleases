 MEDIA RELEASE    

 Saturday, 25th January 2014    

 Greens go on fact-finding mission to Christmas  Island    

 The Australian Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, will travel to  Christmas Island today and spend several days inspecting the detention centre on the island and  meeting with refugees who are detained there.    

 “Reports of mass hunger strikes, self-harm incidents and increasing tensions within the centre are  very concerning,” Senator Hanson-Young said.    

 “The government’s obsession with secrecy has been expanded to cover Christmas Island, but  nothing can hide the fact that people are suffering.    

 “Tony Abbott needs to understand that locking people up on islands doesn’t make them invisible  and that treating them like criminals doesn’t make them illegal.”    

 Senator Hanson-Young will meet with men, women, children and family groups in the detention  centre, as well as Christmas Island community members, to discuss the current situation there.    

 “There are hundreds of children detained on Christmas Island and they cannot be forgotten, despite  the government’s best attempts to keep them hidden,” Senator Hanson-Young said.   

 “I’ll be looking into reports that families have been separated and that pregnant women have been  denied essential medical services.    

 “If the government has nothing to hide, why is it so keen to keep the Australian public in the dark  about Christmas Island?”
