 Minister Pursues Reform in UN Refugee Arrangements MPS 100/2000

 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock leaves for Geneva today (Saturday, 30 September) to attend a meeting of the Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).

 The visit is part of Australia's intensified efforts in working with other countries and United Nations officials to reform the Office of the UNHCR and its Executive Committee.

 As was announced at the end of August, Mr Ruddock will be involved in extensive consultations with Ministers of like-minded countries and UN organisations over the next twelve months to ensure there is a concerted and consistent approach to improving the functioning of the international protection system.

 Mr Ruddock affirmed Australia's strong commitment to the international promotion and protection of human rights and to meeting obligations under the Refugee Convention.

 "The Government's review of Australia's interaction with UN Treaty Bodies found that while UNHCR had made a significant contribution to the international refugee protection system, extensive reform is necessary," Mr Ruddock said.

 "Suitable reform would enable the UNHCR and its Executive Committee to provide better assistance and support to countries in meeting the challenges of providing refugee protection to those most in need, while combating people smuggling."

 Following his visit to Geneva, Mr Ruddock will travel to Port Moresby for consultations with senior ministers on enhancing arrangements with Papua New Guinea to counter people trafficking.

 "PNG is our nearest neighbour and we share an interest in having strong bilateral arrangements to protect our borders," Mr Ruddock said.

 During the week Mr Ruddock is overseas, Attorney General Daryl Williams will be acting Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.
