 WHY HAVE CONSULTATIONS ON IMMIGRATION INTAKE BEEN CANCELLED?

 Senator John Coulter, spokesperson for the Australian Democrats on Population  and Immigration, expressed concern today at cancellation of the Canberra hearings  as part of consultations for setting the immigration intake.

 Senator Coulter also said that recent comments of the Minister for Immigration,  Senator Nick Bolkus, that the intake should stay at 80,000 were premature when he  had only just started the consultative process.

 "It is absolutely vital that a range of views be heard from a number of organisations  and community groups about the immigrant intake" said Senator Coulter. "It is  particularly important for a Minister very new in the portfolio to hear what they  have to say.

 "There are a number of environmental and economic reasons why the intake should  be reduced. Australia cannot support a large population whether it grows through  natural increase or by immigration. v

 "Irrespective of whether we are nearing the end of the recession or not, there are  still nearly a million people unemployed. We have virtually all the skills we need.  There is little justification for much of the program except for the humanitarian  component.

 "If he is going to retain the program at 80,000, it is to be hoped that he will increase  the refugee intake to 20,000" concluded Senator Coulter.
