 Improved resource for migrants and refugees  starting life in Australia  Friday, 22 October 2010 

 The Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Kate Lundy,  was pleased to announce today the release of an enhanced information resource for  new migrants, with the 2010 edition of Beginning a Life in Australia now available. 

 Beginning a Life in Australia is a unique resource for migrants, humanitarian  entrants, their sponsors and settlement organisations. It is designed to let migrants  settle more effectively and provides vital information on housing, employment and  services such as English language training. 

 'Newly arrived migrants and refugees face a lot of challenges when they arrive in  Australia,' Senator Lundy said. 

 'As a government, it's important that we welcome them with useful, up-to-date  settlement information to help them begin their lives here.' 

 The previous edition of Beginning a Life in Australia was immensely popular, with the  web version receiving some 850 000 hits in 2009. 

 The new edition has a streamlined format with national coverage, incorporating all  state, territory and local settlement information in one resource. 

 'The government is committed to providing comprehensive and effective settlement  support to those who migrate to Australia,' Senator Lundy said. 

 'I hope that our newly arrived migrants, refugees and humanitarian entrants take  advantage of this resource as they settle into their new home. 

 'The booklet is available in English and 37 community languages, and is readily  accessible through the Department of Immigration and Citizenship's website.'
