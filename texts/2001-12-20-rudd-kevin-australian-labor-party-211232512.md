 AFGHANISTAN TACKLING THE REFUGEE PROBLEM AT SOURCE

 A Report on the Humanitarian Crisis and the Economic Reconstruction Challenge in Post-Conflict Afghanistan

 VISIT TO ISLAMABAD AND PESHAWAR BY KEVIN RUDD MP, SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

 (10 DECEMBER - 15 DECEMBER 2001)

 1

 Introduction

 Between 11-15 December 2001, I visited Islamabad and the Peshawar region on the Pakistan / Afghanistan border.

 2. The purpose of this visit was threefold:

 â¢ to investigate the quantum of the humanitarian crisis arising from the recent conflict;

 â¢ to investigate the international reconstruction programme for Afghanistan for the post-conflict period;

 â¢ to investigate the resource capacity of UN agencies and donor countries including Australia to meet the immediate humanitarian needs and medium term reconstruction requirements for Afghanistan - and to make recommendations on how gaps might be filled.

 3. The visit was timely given the current state of Australia’s humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan.  On 23 September, the Australian Government announced the allocation of $14.3 million towards the delivery of humanitarian assistance to displaced and refugee populations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. An additional $9 million contribution was announced on 4 October.  So far $13.3 million of this $23.3 million commitment has been allocated to various United Nations and NGO humanitarian programs (see Attachment A).  As of 18 December, however, $10 million remain unallocated.  This is surprising given the urgency of the humanitarian crisis.

 4. My programme in Pakistan comprised appointments with the Foreign Secretary of Pakistan and other representatives of the Government of Pakistan; the UN Co-coordinator for Afghanistan and representatives of the other principal UN agencies engaged in the Afghanistan humanitarian and reconstruction programme; as well as officials from the Australian High Commission in Islamabad.  I also met with the Interior Minister of Pakistan and discussed with him practical proposals for improving visa processing, passport control and overall border security in Pakistan.  Details of my programme can be found at Attachment B.  I would like to record my appreciation to the Australian High Commission in Islamabad for the practical and professional assistance they extended to me during my visit.

 5. My visit to Islamabad was consistent with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade travel advisory notice of 30 November 2001.  It should also be noted that not only were there multiple ministerial visits from other countries to Islamabad at about the time of my visit, a number of these Minsters proceeded to Peshawar and Kabul itself.  In fact, since September 11, I was advised that some 19 Heads of Government or persons of Foreign Ministerial or Ministerial standing had visited Islamabad.

 Overview

 6. As the U.S.-led military campaign against the Taliban and the al-Qaida terrorist organisation has made rapid advances, international attention has turned to the need for a comprehensive approach to reconstruction and development in Afghanistan.  It is widely recognised that Afghanistan cannot be left as a failed state that might again shelter terrorists, generate refugee outflows and breed instability across the region.  Rebuilding the country will require an immense commitment of resources and attention by the international community for some time to come.  Terrorism triggered the intervention in Afghanistan but donor countries are going to have to tackle a much wider array of issues to bring long-term stability.

 7. The immediate tasks are threefold: putting in place a new government that represents as wide a cross section of Afghans as possible; rebuilding an administration, capable in the first instance of handling increased levels of humanitarian aid; and ensuring security on the ground for an interim government, for humanitarian relief efforts, and for returning Afghani refugees.

 8. According to senior United Nations officials, the priority through until July 2002 will be the maintenance of a large-scale humanitarian effort in support of 5-6 million Afghans assessed to be in acute emergency humanitarian assistance for the next 3-6 months.  During this period, detailed plans will be developed by the UN for the reconstruction phase of the Afghanistan operation.

 9. A major stage in this planning process for the reconstruction programme will be a Tokyo Donors Conference in late January when the final needs assessment for the reconstruction phase will be determined - as well as indicative pledges made by donor countries themselves.

 10. The universal view of UN agencies, as well as representatives of the Government of Pakistan which itself currently has some 3.1 million Afghan refugees, is that a successful humanitarian effort and reconstruction programme over the course of the next 3-12 months constitutes a critical precondition for the successful repatriation of Afghan refugees abroad - as well as for the successful relocation of internally displaced Afghans within the country itself.

 11. The United Nations has been leading efforts to bring Afghans together in a multi-ethnic government.  On 5 December, Afghan faction leaders meeting in Bonn agreed a power-sharing agreement to establish an interim government in Afghanistan.  The accord, signed by the leaders of four delegations and UN special envoy for Afghanistan, Hakhdar Brahimi, provides for the formation of a 30 member interim cabinet headed by Pashtun leader Hamid Karzai.  Under the plan, the interim cabinet will take office on 22 December and govern for six months until a national assembly, or loya jirga, convenes to ratify a transitional government, paving the way for elections within two years.  The former Afghan King Zaher Shah is to convene the loya jirga.  Also envisaged are the deployment of an international security force to

 3

 Kabul and other parts of the country, steps to integrate Afghan militias into a future national army, and the creation of a supreme court.  Other challenges include rebuilding institutions such as a central bank, a taxation department and a body to coordinate foreign aid programs with national institutions.

 12. It is important to note that conflict in Afghanistan did not begin with the Taliban and it will not necessarily end with their removal.  There is a diversity of opinion in Islamabad about the political durability of the Bonn agreement. Various UN offices and NGOs voiced concerns about the political ‘balance’ of the interim administration under.  Some Pakistan officials were more specific: the apparent pre-dominance of the Northern Alliance in the allocation of cabinet positions in the interim administration meant that non Northern Alliance (17 out of 31) groups may harbour resentments.  As one senior UN official note: “there was a need to avoid euphoria at the political settlement achieved in Bonn.  As much political work lay ahead and the potential for the arrangement to unravel remain high”.

 International Security Assistance Force

 13. The potentially fractious nature of the interim government in Kabul coupled with a general culture of warlordism entrenched over more than 20 years make critical the rapid deployment of a multinational force.  Its mandate should be robust and not limited to the physical security of government buildings as some Afghan factional leaders have suggested nor can it be limited to Kabul to the major cities because lawlessness and insecurity is a problem across the country side - preventing the returning IDP’s (internally displaced persons) with Afghanistan and the repatriation of refugees currently seeking protection outside Afghanistan.  Security is a central pre-condition for the return of IDP’s and refugees.  Attachment C is a map prepared recently by UNSECCORD that gives some indication of the extent of insecurity across Afghanistan.

 14. On 19 December, United Kingdom Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon announced that the United Kingdom is prepared to lead an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan for a limited period of approximately three months.  A United Nations Security Council resolution to authorise deployment under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter is anticipated in a few days.  A deployment under Chapter 7 would allow the ISAF to use force as required.

 15. On the question of Australian participation in such a force, it is clear that Australia is substantially committed with 12,50 to 1,500 troops to East Timor and will be for some time in the future.  It is also clear that Australia currently has deployed various assets to assist Coalition operations in Afghanistan.  Australia should nevertheless be prepared to make a modest contribution to the ISAF, provided the International Force has a clear mandate and timeframe, an Australian contribution is sustainable and does not compromise existing Australian peacekeeping commitments, especially our support force peace and security in East Timor.

 4

 Recommendation

 It is recommended that Australia make an appropriate and sustainable contribution to the ISAF within the framework of a clear mandate and timeframe.

 De-mining Afghanistan

 16. De-mining is equally fundamental to the restoration of security in Afghanistan.  Afghanistan after 20 years of civil war has become one o f the most mined countries in the world.  UN agencies and NGOs with whom I spoke in Islamabad regard an acceleration of the de-mining program as fundamental to security for returning IDP’s and refugees; for the delivery of emergency food and the reconstruction of roads and agriculture.  The UNHCR Country Co-ordinator for Afghanistan advised that his office in certain cases has had to advise internally displaced persons against returning home because of the mine threat

 17. Prior to the renewal of conflict after September 11, the total contaminated area of Afghanistan had identified was 948 square km.  This included

 â¢ 157 square km’s of agricultural land . â¢ 14 square km’s of residential and commercial land â¢ 3 square km’s of irrigation canals â¢ 32 square km’s of roads â¢ 138 square km’s of grazing land

 18. Attachment D illustrates the extent of the landmine problem across the country.  The human and economic impact of the landmine problem has been immense.  Quite apart from the impact on agriculture and transportation, non combatant causalities are estimated to be as high as 150 - 300 per month - with many more believed to die before receiving medical treatment.  I encountered a number of civilian’s casualties of land mine accidents at the Shamshatoo refugee camp near Peshawar.

 19. In January 1990 UNOCHA initiated the mine action programme for Afghanistan (MAP) the year 2001 marks the 12th year of MAP’s mine action work in Afghanistan.  The current workforce of MAPA includes 10 expatriates and 4,800 Afghans.  The Director of MAPA advised that in the 12 year history of the programme, there had only been one causality from among the many de-mining teams working across Afghanistan.  (See Attachment E.)

 20. Some 20 supporter countries including Australia have contributed to this programme (of approximately $20 million US per year) since the early 1990’s.  Australia has been a modest but consistent contributor - with the exception of 1999 when it contributed zero.  The pattern of donor country contributions can be found in Attachment F.

 5

 21. Because of the impact of post 11 September hostilities, the proliferation of unexploded ordinance (in particular yellow coloured US Cluster Bombs which are particularly attractive to children who, attracted to the brightness of the colour are in danger of mistaking unexploded cluster bombs for similarly coloured US Aid food packages dropped across Afghanistan) in addition to fresh mine laying by retreating Taliban, the mission of MAPA has become massively compounded.  As a result of this, the UN Co-ordinator for Humanitarian Affairs has launched an emergency plan for donor states for the period October 2001 - March 2002.  This appeal is for a total of US $34 million for the upcoming 3-4 month period in order to undertake emergency mine clearance in areas impeding refugee repatriation and the return of internally displaced persons.  Of this amount, as of 13 December, UNOCHA advised that there was still a shortfall of US$15.8 million.  The breakdown of this appeal is outlined in Attachment F.   

 22. Australia has provided US $256,000 to the general appeal.  This does not appear to take into account the urgent and expanded demands of the mine action programme.  It also noteworthy that Australia’s contribution stands at less than 10% of the Netherlands - a country of comparable economic size to Australia and arguably a country less effected by refugee outflow from the region than Australia.  It is also noteworthy that according to UNOCHA, Australia’s contribution represents little more than half that of New Zealand.

 23. According to the UN Co-ordinator for Afghanistan, the UN estimate is that it would need US $30 million per year for 12 years to clear the bulk of unexploded landmines in Afghanistan.  The UN could achieve this in 3 years if donor countries provided US $200 million per year.

 24. Australia has a proud history of involvement in engagement in de-mining operations - most particularly in Cambodia and, in the early 1990’s in Afghanistan itself.  Australian Defence personnel deployed in the Afghanistan de-mining operation have since been employed by the UN to assist with the UN’s global responsibilities in the area of de-mining.  The Programme Co-ordinator for MAPA also advised that a South Australian firm had produced the best de-mining device available on the international market.

 Recommendation

 It is recommended that for the upcoming emergency requirements of the period until March 2002, Australia should contribute an additional US$2 million to the emergency UNOCHA donor alert for the Mine Action Programme for Afghanistan.  This additional contribution should be made immediately and ideally this contribution should be made in cash.  The Programme Manager of the Mine Action Programme indicated that some supplementation of an Australian contribution could be made in kind given the considerable expertise that Australia has in the de-mining area.

 Coalition Information Service

 25. Part of the overall campaign in support of Coalition operations in Afghanistan at present and for the restoration of security for the people of Afghanistan is provided by the Coalition Information Service.  This is a high level operation in Islamabad staffed by senior diplomatic, political and media personnel from participating states in the coalition.  I met with the information Service in Islamabad and was briefed by Ambassador Kenton Keith.

 26. The CIS is designed in part to counter some of the disinformation activities engaged in some media outlets in Islamic countries.  In terms of the long-term impact of the current campaign against terrorism, participating states are of the view that it is vital that the rationale for, and day to day conduct of, Coalition operations are conveyed factually to the people of the region.  If this does not occur, a long-term reaction to Western countries from certain Islamic states and political forces within them are likely to be compounded.  Ambassador Keith made a particular request for the early attachment of Australia staff to the operation of the CIS.  These are senior appointments.  For example, the United Kingdom is represented by Prime Minister Tony Blair’s former Deputy Chief of Staff.  Ambassador Keith’s particular interest in an Australian secondment to the CIS operation would be if such a person had expertise in South East Asia.  Secondments could be of a period of time between 1 and 6 months.

 Recommendation

 It is recommended that the Australian Government should immediately despatch a senior Australian diplomatic and or political staffer with expertise in Malaysia and Indonesia in particular for a 3-6 month secondment to the CIS.

 27. Australia’s interest would be served by such a secondment as it would provide a centralised vehicle through which the presentation of Coalition operations as they effect media perceptions in Malaysia and Indonesia - countries of direct strategic interest to Australia - can be managed.  It is surprising that such a secondment has not already been put in place by the Australian Government.

 Humanitarian emergency

 28. The extent of the current humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is the product of 23 years of sustained military conflict, a succession of political regimes uncommitted to the development of basic social and economic infrastructure, compounded by a 4 year long drought - one of the worst in Afghanistan’s recorded history.

 7

 29. According to the UNDP:

 â¢ Of a total estimated population of 18 million, 12 million Afghans are currently affected by drought and 3-4 million are severely affected. â¢ An estimated 3.8 million Afghans are currently dependant on food aid. â¢ Between 5.3 and6.3 million people within Afghanistan are deemed

 vulnerable - including 1.2 million IDPs. â¢ There are between 2 and 3.1 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan and 1.5 million Afghan refugees in Iran. â¢ 57% of Afghan children under 5 are malnourished. â¢ Afghanistan currently has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the

 world, with one in four children dying before the age of 5 and that figure possibly rising to one in three as a result of the upcoming winter. â¢ Maternal mortality is also high by UN standards and 1700 per 100,000. â¢ Only 11 out of Afghanistan’s 31 provinces have essential obstetric care services. â¢ The UN calculates that every day, 45 women die of pregnancy related causes resulting in over 16,000 deaths per year. â¢ An estimated 23% of the population has access to safe water and only 12% access to adequate sanitation. â¢ Primary school enrolment ratio for Afghanistan has recently been calculated as being 39% for boys with a corresponding rate of 3% for girls.

 30. This drastic humanitarian situation has been compounded by the impact of post 11 September conflict in Afghanistan.  It has also been complicated by the upcoming winter.

 â¢ The number of internally displaced persons has increased to approximately 1.6 million. â¢ A further 160,000 persons have crossed the border into Pakistan - although this number is much lower than it would otherwise be because

 of the decision by Pakistan to close its borders other than to the most vulnerable cases. â¢ Further crossings have also occurred into Iran. â¢ Physical access to internally displaced persons and other vulnerable people - now estimated by the UN to be in the vicinity of 7 million in total - is now radically impeded by further conflict, the further proliferation of land mines and unexploded ordinance.

 31. To respond to this unfolding  humanitarian crisis, the UN Office of the Co-ordination of  Humanitarian Affairs launched a UN consolidated Interagency Appeal in November.  The specific purpose of this appeal is to fund immediate emergency expenditures through UN relief agencies for the period through until 31 March 2002 - that is approximately the end of winter.

 32. The combined funding requirement for this period is $661.9 million this figure was confirmed at a meeting of the UN donor countries (including Australia represented by AUSAID) in Berlin in early December.  As of 9

 8

 December, the UN had $357.8 million of this $661.9 million available.  In other words, 44% of the current appeal remains uncovered as winter sets in.  The UN has stated that “7.5 million Afghans are in need of emergency assistance over the next 4 months through to the end of the alert period.”

 33. Nearly half of the funding already available to the UN under the interagency appeal has been provided by the United States and Japan.   The Netherlands has provided US $19.5 million or 7.1% of the total funds. Australia by contrast has provided $5.9 million or 2.2% of the total funding available.  Once again it should be emphasised that Australia and the Netherlands are economies of comparable size.  Details of country-by-country donations are illustrated in Attachment H.

 34. In discussions with the UN co-ordinator for Afghanistan, it was stated that “the priorities for Afghanistan could be listed in the following order; mine clearance, food distribution, return of internally displaced persons and education.  Following these four, there are a different set of priorities such as clean water systems, sanitation and irrigation.”  The UN Coordinator went further to observe:

 “To date there has been a relatively weak correlation between individual donors pledges of assistance to Afghanistan and the actual funds that the agencies have received.  On the most recent round of donor pledges, 46% remain to be collected….  If donors under-subscribe for food aid, there will be problems with feeding people next northern summer.  Furthermore, the UNHCR budget is not sufficient to repatriate all of the 5million Afghan refugees in Iran and Pakistan. UNICEF have a goal of getting 1.5million children into school on the start of the new school year on the 21 March 2002.  But they need funding to train and pay teachers.”

 35. In its situation report dated 10 December, UNOCHA emphasised that 7 of the UN agencies participating in the interagency emergency appeal, including UNICEF, were less than 40% funded.  This was a matter of considerable continuing concern.

 36. UNOCHA have further indicated that an additional immediate need was budgetary support for the new interim administration  itself.  The UN estimates US$20-30 million will be required for 6 months of budgetary support in order to underpin the most basic functioning of a central administration.  The most recently available Taliban budget was US$80 million.  The current interagency donor alert covers the period until 31 March 2002.  UNOCHA is currently developing a comprehensive and consolidated appeal to provide a clear picture for humanitarian assistance for the period from 31 December 2002 - incorporating activities already undertaken under the emergency interagency appeal.  The comprehensive Consolidated Appeal is expected to be launched by the end of February 2002.

 9

 Recommendation

 It is recommended that Australia lift its current contribution to the UN Consolidated Interagency Appeal from US$5.9 million by an additional US$13 million thereby raising Australia’s contribution to this immediate humanitarian appeal to half that of The Netherlands.  This increase should be in addition to the US$2 million increase recommended above specifically for the United Nations Mine Action Programme.

 Refugees

 37. In a meeting with the Chief of Mission for the UNHCR, Afghanistan, it became clear that UNHCR currently has a target to repatriate 1 million Afghans during 2002.  The bulk of these would come from Pakistan and Iraq. There are also some 300,000 Afghans currently in Russia - some of whom who would also return.  Furthermore, “tens of thousands would be repatriated from outside the region”.

 38. UNHCR “considers that the target of 1 million repatriations was possible.  That said the absorptive capacity of Afghanistan to accommodate more returnees was limited by security consideration including the pace of the de-mining programme; the small economic absorption capacity economy (i.e. to generate jobs and thereby act as a pull factor to potential returnees)” and the pace of the international reconstruction effort in Afghanistan”.

 39. Furthermore, the UNHCR Chief of Mission stated that while the UNHCR would aim to repatriate 1 million Afghans in 2002, he was concerned that there would be insufficient pull factors (for example security, education and employment) in the short term to “anchor” them in Afghanistan.

 40. These are most significant observations and have direct implications for how Australia views our own difficulties with the return of Afghan asylum seekers in South East Asia and the South Pacific.  In the absence of better security (including mine security), better food security, as well as education and employment opportunities, there would be insufficient “pull factors” in order to attract Afghans to return to their country- or to cause those who are currently internally displaced persons within Afghanistan to remain within their country.

 41. For these reasons, Australia, in addition to its humanitarian concerns for the well being of 7.5 million fellow human beings, has self-interest at stake in fully participating restoring Afghanistan’s security, ensuring that food security is restored as well as participating meaningfully in the rebuilding of the country in concert with other donor states.

 42. A failure to address these pull factors within Afghanistan itself would mean that the  2 - 3.1 million Afghans currently in Pakistan, the 1.1 million Afghans currently in Iran, as well as the 1.5 million internally displaced persons within Afghanistan itself, potentially become long term sources of

 10

 refugee outflow to the rest of the region and the world.  That does not of course mean that all are in a position to leave for destinations elsewhere. Plainly that is not the case.  However, the fundamental absence of physical security and economic livelihood at home create irresistible push factors which, if not addressed at source, in the long term place much greater strain on potential destination countries including Australia.  For example, if only 1% of those currently designated as Afghan refugees and IDP’s were to exit the immediate region for third countries, more than 50,000 Afghans would enter the international people smuggling market.

 43. The logic of the UNHCR position of the paramount importance of addressing this problem at its source is unassailable.  The international community, including Australia, does so,  there is a far greater prospect of making the regional and global outflow of refugees from Afghanistan more manageable in the future.  By contrast, if these pull factors are not addressed at source and instead compound to become push factors to the rest of the world, including Australia, it is highly questionable whether the Australian Government’s so called “Pacific Solution” will be viable in terms of absorptive capacity - let alone financially viable in terms of the cost to the Australian tax payer.

 Recommendation

 It is recommended that US6.5 million of the additional US$13 million recommended above for contribution to the emergency UN Consolidated Interagency Appeal for the period to 31 March 2002 be directed to the UNHCR.  The UNHCR is currently 42% under funded for the humanitarian other tasks for which it is responsible for the upcoming winter period.

 Implications of refugees for neighbouring states

 44. The continuing non-resolution of the Afghan refugee crisis has profound implications for both Iran and Pakistan.  As indicated above, Afghan refugees in Pakistan are now estimated to be 3.1 million (Government of Pakistan estimate) or 2.1 million (UN estimate).

 45. The influx of Afghan refugees to Pakistan began after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan 1978.  By mid 1980 there where about 1 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan.  This figure grew to 3.2 million by 1990. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, there was an initial large repatriation of more than 1 million refugees back to Afghanistan.  However the onset of political and military instability within Afghanistan during both the pre-Taliban and Taliban periods of the 1990’s, the Government of Pakistan estimate that a further half million refugees have arrived in that period including an additional 150,000 in the last 2 months since the outbreak of hostilities in October.  (Attachment I provides an indication of the physical distribution of the 3.1 million refugees across Pakistan.)  It will be noted that only about half of this number are confined to camps.  The other half has been

 11

 partially absorbed into local Pakistani communities - causing considerable disruption to local community and economic life.

 46. Pakistani officials believe this large scale influx over such a large period of time has had a detrimental impact on Pakistan’s economy, eroded its taxation base, resulted in massive job substitution and loss of employment for local Pakistani’s, increased lawlessness and created a massive drug problem.

 47. The cost to Pakistan’s budget for this two decade long problem has been significant.  The world food programme assisted the Government of Pakistan for 15years through until 1995 with a significant assistance programme for refugees.  However with the discontinuation of this programme, the funding burden fell primarily to Pakistan itself.

 48. In the period since September 11, Pakistan decided to close its borders - fearing an avalanche of refugees from its north.  On 3 November, Pakistan’s President announced a 3-part policy including:

 â¢ Provision of food security in Afghanistan under the auspices of the World Food Program. â¢ The establishment of internally displaced person (IDP) camps inside Afghanistan under the auspices of UNOCHA and UNHCR; and â¢ The establishment of additional refugee camps in north west frontier

 province of Afghanistan and near the border of Blaochistan to accommodate the most vulnerable - as well as those who have “invisibly” trickled into Pakistan across borders.

 49. In implementing the third element of this strategy, 24 new campsites have been identified, 8 sites prepared and two constructed.  The two constructed have broadly been sufficient for the influx of 150,000 refugees since October.

 50. Pakistan Government policy for more than 20 years has been one that has encouraged “voluntary repatriation”.  However recent policy initiatives by the government to concentrate those Afghan’s who have sought to absorb themselves into Pakistani society back into camps, and to keep new arrivals confined to new camps, indicates a hardening of the government’s position. As the government stated recently, “it is the stated policy of the Government of Pakistan that all those externally displaced persons / refugees who are in Pakistan presently (old and new) must be repatriated.”

 51. in my discussions with the Pakistan Foreign Secretary, it was stated quite clearly that “for Pakistan a high priority would be the eventual repatriation of 3 million Afghan refugees now resident in Pakistan.”  However “the speed of their return would depend largely on the pace of reconstruction in Afghanistan”  According to the Pakistan Government, “responsibility devolves on the UN , the international community and indeed the new Afghan leadership to ensure there is immediate normalcy in the entire country so that reconstruction and rehabilitation of all sectors of life can begin in Afghanistan.

 12

 When this happens, refugees will be encouraged of themselves to go back to their country”.

 Recommendation

 It is recommended that the Australian Government take a leading role within UN fora to ensure that the disproportionate burden faced by the Government of Pakistan receives significantly greater funding assistance from UN Agencies.

 52. If Pakistan is better able to cope with its existing refugee load and succeed in repatriating the large Afghan population currently within its borders, not only will be good for Pakistan and Afghanistan, it will be good for the rest of the region which continues to suffer some instability arising from illegal international people movements out of Pakistan itself.

 53. On this question, Pakistan Government officials both within the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry for Repatriation have raised their dealings with Australian government on this matter.

 54. It was noted with some frustration by Pakistani officials that during a visit by Minister Ruddock 18 months ago to Islamabad, Australia had proposed two memoranda of understanding: one which would require the Government of Pakistan to accept illegal Afghan asylum seekers back through Pakistan for repatriation to Afghanistan; and a second memorandum which required the government of Pakistan to accept back into Pakistan itself unlawful asylum seekers who, at the time of seeking asylum in Australia had already been long- term residents of refugee camps within Pakistan. Pakistani officials made it clear that they were not minded to concur with either of Australia’s proposals. In the first place, they feared that if they did so, this would create a considerable precedent with other resettlement countries in Europe which took considerably greater numbers of Afghan refugees than did Australia.  Second, they expressed puzzlement as to why, in their experience, Australia was the only resettlement country which had raised concerns with Pakistan on this matter.  Third, Pakistan believed Australia’s problems of having to process several thousand asylum seekers over the last several years paled into insignificance against the 3.1 million refugees that Pakistan had to support each day.

 55. In a meeting with the Pakistan Interior Minister, a practical question was raised of the adequacy of Pakistan’s border controls, as well as its passport and visa controls systems.  The Interior Minster made it plain that Pakistan’s limited resources allowed only one fully computerised border control point of the 18 border control points across the country.  Furthermore, Pakistan passports had yet to be fully “mechanised” which further hampered the implementation of effective tracking systems across the country.  The Interior Minister indicated that these matters had been raised recently with him in the context of a broader discussion on terrorism with the US Government. The United States had agreed to support a funding proposal to assist Pakistan

 13

 rapidly to increase the computerisation of its border controls as well accelerate the introduction of fully “mechanised” passports for the entire country.

 Recommendation

 It is recommended that the Australian Government immediately initiate discussions with the Pakistani Interior Minister on his Ministry’s resource needs for the implementation of fully computerised border control points and enable a more effective tracking of people movements.  Australia’s Customs Service has considerable technical expertise in this area and this could greatly assist the Pakistani authorities.

 Food Security

 56. The World Food Programme estimates that 6 million Afghans are currently in need of food support.  This is currently being delivered by shipping food into Afghanistan at the rate of 52,000 tonnes per month.  This will continue until March 2002.

 57. According to Burkard Oberle, the Representative for Afghanistan for the World Food Programme, shipments of food into the country have proceeded relatively smoothly.  Access to remote locations and all those affected by land mines was a much more problematic proposition.  Oberle indicated that there had been some evidence of malnutrition - particularly among children.  In the medium term, it is vital to resuscitate Afghan agriculture.  This meant improving roads (subsequent to de-mining); reconstructing irrigation channels (again requiring de-mining); and introducing seed and fertiliser stock.  If the current drought continued and winter rains do not come, major problems would emerge by the middle of next year when the harvest is due.

 58. Oberle said that the WFP was in the process of implementing a programme that would facilitate the return of Afghans in at least some parts of the country.  He noted that in 2002, WFP was planning to provide adequate food for between 200,000-300,000 returnees.  He added “that security was a major constraint in the WFP programme delivery”.  The problem of landmines and the logistical difficulties in delivering food to remote rural areas were factors that inhibited WFP programme delivery.

 59. Oberle was relatively confident (unlike the heads of other UN agencies) that the WFP’s needs as part of the interagency appeal co-ordinated by UNOHCA would be met for the current period expiring 31 March 2002.  For WFP, the problems seem to be less one of available funds and food than one of overcoming the physical access problems referred to above.

 60. If physical access remains a problem for the more remote parts of Afghanistan during the winter, the WFP have not ruled out the possibility of using airdrops of food stop.  This was extraordinarily expensive and only

 14

 partly effective.  However in certain remote parts of the country it may the only viable means of ensuring some level of emergency food delivery in the 3 months ahead.

 61. The extent and geographical spread of food insecurity across Afghanistan is illustrated by the map at Attachment J.

 UNICEF

 62. Child health and infant mortality statistics in Afghanistan have been referred to above.  To recapitulate:

 â¢ One out of every four children in Afghanistan dies before reaching their 5th birthday. â¢ Half of all Afghan children suffer from chronic malnutrition. â¢ One women dies every half hr from complications related to pregnancy

 and childbirth. â¢ While only a quarter of men are literate, only 5% of women can read and write.

 63. UNICEF calculates that at least 1.7 million children and 1 million women of childbearing age are in urgent need of  humanitarian assistance. UNICEF have also stated that in a worse case scenario, as many as 128,000 children will die in the coming 6 months out of a population of 7.5 million Afghans now estimated by the UN to be affected by the crisis.  UNICEF states that “this is almost 3 times as many as the 47,000 children who would die in normal circumstances”.

 64. This grim scenario assumes limited access and a doubling of mortality attributable to measles, diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections exasperated by higher rates of malnutrition.  UNICEF at the beginning of the crisis sought a US $36 million under the donor alert but given the deterioration in the circumstances of children in the current environment they are now seeking US$108 million for the period up until 2002.  To date only 38% of the UNICEF donor appeal within the overall UNOCHA appeal has been met.

 Recommendation

 It is recommended that US$6.5 million of the additional recommended US$13 million contribution to UNOCHA interagency appeal be allocated to the UNICEF appeal for emergency humanitarian programs for children.

 65. In discussion with the UNICEF Representative for Afghanistan in Pakistan, UNICEF noted three major operational constraints: â¢ Like the WFP, difficulty in access Afghans in remote areas; â¢ Limited number of partners (that is local Afghan organisations and non

 government organisations) to effectively implement UNICEF programmes; and

 15

 â¢ The particular problems opposed by mines and unexploded ordinance.

 66. Interestingly, the UNICEF Director spoke highly of a two year long UNICEF-AusAID project with a total estimated expenditure of AU$1.2 million on girls primary education in Balochistan This is one of the poorest areas of Pakistan and while the programme is not explicitly targeted on Afghan refugees, it holds potential in terms of its application to the  particular needs of Afghan girls who have had no educational opportunity for the last 5 years. The female school participation rate in Balochistan is 5%.  In Afghanistan it is only 3%.  These are among the lowest female school participation rates anywhere in the world.

 Recommendation

 In discussions with UNICEF, I agreed to raise this matter with the Australian Government on my return.  It is recommended that the Australian Government fund UNICEF through its current emergency programme allocate an additional US$1 million so that for educating girls in Balochistan can be extended into the adjoining areas of Afghanistan.

 Economic reconstruction - A New Marshall Plan for Afghanistan

 68. Parallel to the needs analysis being undertaken by UNOCHA for the immediate humanitarian needs of Afghanistan, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and UNDP are currently assembling a comprehensive needs analysis for the long-term social economic reconstruction of the country.  Japan and the US are currently driving this process at the political level.  It will come to a head in January 2002 at a proposed donors meeting in Tokyo.

 69. In the period since the Soviet invasion of 1979, Afghanistan’s economy has crumbled: â¢ Prior to 1978, Afghanistan was self-sufficient in food and a net exporter of agricultural products.

 â¢ Agriculture and animal husbandry were gradually replaced by opium poppy cultivation as the country’s principal income earner - making Afghanistan by the late 1990’s the world’s largest producer of opium poppy.

 â¢ During the Taliban period, three main sources of income emerged: regulation of smuggling; control of aid distribution; and as indicated above, regulation of poppy cultivation and opium processing.  All were consumption-laden forms of rent-seeking. All were also quite profitable for the Taliban until the later decided - belatedly - to ban poppy cultivation with huge impact on what had become the poppy dependent rural economy.

 16

 â¢ All of the above have been compounded by the four year drought, the impact of landmines and unexploded ordinance and the rolling military conflict.

 â¢ There is a negligible manufacturing base in Afghanistan and a poorly developed service sector. â¢ The health, education and transport sectors are in a state of collapse. â¢ The ADB estimates that current per capita income is no more

 than $US300 per year making Afghanistan one of the poorest countries on earth.

 70. The estimated costs for the reconstruction of the economy vary widely.  Assessments, including by the World Bank, have noted that:

 â¢ Cambodia required US$1.6 billion for the first two years. â¢ In the West Bank and Gaza, US$3 billion in reconstruction was mandated for the first two years for an entity that had only two million people.

 â¢ In Bosnia, pledges of US$5.4 billion were made for 1995-99 for a country of five million people. â¢ East Timor is receiving $350 million over 3years for reconstruction with a population of less than 500,000 people. â¢ For Afghanistan with a population of 25 million, the resource

 implications are very significant.  Afghanistan is not a microstate. As the international Crisis Group has recently noted: current reconstruction resource estimates range from $US5-6 billion over fiver years to $US25 billion over 10 years.

 71. The World Bank and the other international financial institutions are also assembling appropriate machinery packages on how funds would be managed.  Based on experience elsewhere, this would probably take the form of:

 â¢ An International Trust Fund administered by an international agency with macro responsibility for strategy and implementation; â¢ A Domestic Reconstruction Agency staffed by professional qualified staff which would adhere to the bank’s standard development model

 used in other emerging economies, a central authority to settle currency questions and manage the inflationary impact of capital flows, and maintain a central payments system. â¢ Restoration of a Department of Finance to establish basic public revenue raising and expenditure management systems. â¢ A human capital development program to staff and train the above.

 72. Major uncertainties about the reconstruction program therefore include the precise quantum needed; the actual quantum that would be available; the prevailing security environment and the effectiveness of implementation by a wide range of international and national agencies.

 17

 73. The success or failure of this reconstruction program will however, have a profound effect on the future of Afghanistan and the wider world in many different respects: â¢ on security because the absence of social economic development in

 Afghanistan has made the spawning of violent terrorism (with gross global consequences) all the more possible; â¢ on illegal international people movements; and â¢ on the international drugs trade.

 74. Australia, because it has direct interests at stake in all three of these areas should not therefore simply take a back seat in the negotiation of an reconstruction package for Afghanistan.  This does not mean that Australia should seek to be a leading financial contributor to the UN reconstruction budget.  Australia’s contribution should be reasonable and of sufficient size to reflect the interests we have at stake in the outcome and to provide us with sufficient push to have a real impact on policy development.

 75. A critical problem facing the delivery of the reconstruction program for Afghanistan will be effective co-ordination.  Co-ordinating the multilateral reconstruction effort will be sufficiently problematic given the significant number of UN agencies and international financial institutions likely to be involved.  Coordinating the much larger bilateral reconstruction programs of major donor countries will be more difficult again.  Furthermore, over arching coordination of the total multi-lateral and bi-lateral reconstruction effort will be the most difficult of all - given the conflicting national agendas likely to be at work in individual reconstruction projects.

 76. These concerns were reflected by various UN and other personnel with whom I spoke in Islamabad.  The need for the overall reconstruction effort to be driven by a single agency is paramount given the enormity of the task and the scarcity of the resources.  It will also be important to have a single point of interface with the interim and succeeding administrations of Afghanistan so that reconstruction projects are properly prioritised by the donor community and the representatives of the people of Afghanistan.

 77. For these reasons, representations should be made to the European Union and the governments of Japan and the United States that a single international coordinator for reconstruction be established.  This person should be jointly selected by the donor community (both multilateral and bilateral) and the interim administration of Afghanistan.  Accountability arrangements should also be put clearly in place so that there is absolute clarity in the command structure.  If Afghanistan is to be the beneficiary of a new Marshall plan, then the resolution of these administrative arrangements for the reconstruction project should be a matter of immediate priority.

 18

 Recommendation

 It is recommended that the Australian government use its influence with the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom as well as through the international financial institutions to bring about the early establishment of an office of the Co-ordinator General of the Reconstruction for Afghanistan.  This Office should coordinate the totality of the multilateral and bilateral aid effort.

 Australian Bilateral Interests

 78. The national interests that Australia has at stake in the successful resolution of the Afghanistan conflict and the reconstruction of the Afghanistan economy are significant.  In large part, these are driven by:

 â¢ Australia’s long term humanitarian engagement in the emergency assistance and development assistance requirements of developing countries;

 â¢ A desire to have a secure and economically viable Afghanistan to which the people of Afghanistan, both refugees and internally displaced persons, can safely return.

 â¢ The fostering of economic development in Afghanistan in order to prevent the re-emergence of large-scale opium production as a significant source of income generation in the new Afghanistan, with consequent implications foe the international narcotics trade and for Australia’s efforts to combat the drug problem.  .

 79. If Australia fails to address the problem of refugee outflow from Afghanistan at source, then the Australian Government’s “South Pacific Solution” will become nothing but a band-aid approach to solving a much bigger problem.  Fundamental questions must be asked about the cost effectiveness of the current Pacific Solution.  It has been reported in the media that prior to the federal election, the Federal Government anticipated the expenditure of some $400-500 million for its implementation.  This amount, together with the $10 million most recently announced for allocation to the Government of Nauru, stands in stark contrast to the $23.3 million that the Australian government has thus far committed for emergency assistance to Afghanistan, Pakistan and other countries in the region.  The question must be asked whether spending $0.5 billion on 6,000 Afghan asylum seekers in South East Asia and the South Pacific is cost effective against the $23.3 million allocated by the same government to addressing the overarching needs of 5.1 million refugees at source.  The overall logic of this report is that unless Australia in conjunction with the international community rigorously addresses the problems of these refugees at source, deterrent interventions in South East Asia and the South Pacific will ultimately prove ineffective against the quantum of the refugee outflow.

 80. Furthermore, given the dimensions of the drug problem in Australia, we have a large national interest at stake in ensuring that the economic

 19

 reconstruction in Afghanistan reduces, if not eliminates Afghanistan as a major supplier in the international narcotics trade.

 81. Because of these clear national interests, because of the complexity of the  humanitarian and reconstruction tasks identified earlier in this report, and the potential leverage that Australia can have in the rebuilding of Afghanistan, it is important that Australia be in a position to exercise that leverage.

 Recommendation

 The Australian Government should at the earliest opportunity establish an Australian Liaison Office in Kabul for a period of three years.  The function of this office should be to articulate Australian interests on the ground for the successful implementation of the de-mining, humanitarian and reconstruction programs and the impact of these programs on Australia’s interest in the long-term repatriation of Afghan refugees and the reduction and eventual elimination in the illegal narcotics trade.

 82. In the very near future, the humanitarian reconstruction programs will be administered from Kabul and not Islamabad.  For these reasons, it will not be possible for Australia to exercise proper influence over these programs from Islamabad itself.  Furthermore, if there is interim participation by Australia in a peacekeeping operation in Afghanistan, it will be important to support this operation through a properly accredited diplomatic mission.

 Relations with Pakistan

 83. Pakistan is of continuing importance to Australia of itself, in terms of it long standing difficult relationship with India, nuclear weapons proliferation as well as acting as being a transit country for people smuggling and the narcotics trade.

 84. Australia faces continuing difficulties exercising leverage in Islamabad in the absence of continuing high-level political contact.  This is not intended as  criticism of the Australian High Commission in Islamabad which does a good and professional job.  However, there is no substitute for hight level political contact.  I note the fact that my own visit to Islamabad was the first by any Australian politician (either Government of Opposition) since the visit of Immigration Minister Ruddock 18 months ago.  It follows, therefore, that when Australia wishes to influence the Government of Pakistan, the long-term absence of ministerial level contact means there is very limited political capital to draw upon.

 Recommendation

 It is recommended that the Australian Government intensify the pace and regularity of ministerial level contact with Pakistan involving the Foreign, Defence, Industry, Immigration and Justice Ministers and the Attorney-General.
