 Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 603 ILLEGAL BOAT ARRIVALS, 603 LABOR  EXCUSES March 28, 2013

 The arrival of three more illegal boats just over the last 24 hours, with a total of almost 200 people on board, will be met  with more excuses from Labor over their failure to implement the proven measures necessary to stop boat arrivals,  Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border  Protection, Michael Keenan said today.

 “Three boats and almost 200 people have arrived in 24 hours and more than 2,100 people on 32 boats this month and  Labor continues to just make excuses,” Mr Morrison said.

 “All 603 illegal boat arrivals that have come on Labor’s watch have been met with 603 Labor excuses on why they fail to  reinstate the proven border protection measures, which they abolished, which stopped the boats.

 “This record quarter for illegal boat arrivals is continuing and follows the biggest summer of boats on record, as Labor’s  border protection chaos gets worse by the day.

 “When they are not making the chaos on our borders worse through more failed policies, Labor are desperately seeking to  blame the Coalition for their record of failure.

 “The Australian people are sick of Labor's excuses on our borders.

 “Labor started the boats and won't stop them. The Coalition will implement our full suite of proven policies, backed by the  necessary resolve, to get the job done ," Mr Morrison said.

 Mr Keenan said: “The people smugglers have started their next century with another three boats arriving, making it 603  since Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd abolished the Coalition’s proven border protection policies. 

 “Without a change in policy, people will continue to risk their lives by embarking on this treacherous passage to Australia.  Only the Coalition will reinstate the full suite of proven policy measures to stop the boats 

 “If elected the Coalition will re-introduce Temporary Protection Visas to deny the people smugglers a product to sell, have  rigorous offshore processing, and give new orders to the Navy to turn back boats where it is safe to do so.

 “Immediate action must be taken to strengthen our porous borders and stop people risking their lives,” Mr Keenan said.
