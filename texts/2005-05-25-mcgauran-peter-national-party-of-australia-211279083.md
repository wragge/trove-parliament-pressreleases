 Media Release 

 A Milestone for Australian Vietnamese

 25 May 2005

 Today marks 30 years since Vietnamese refugees first fled to Australia to start building new lives, Minister for Citizenship  and Multicultural Affairs Peter McGauran said today.

 ‘Over the last three decades, Australians of Vietnamese heritage have made an immeasurable contribution to the growth  and diversity of our nation,’ Minister McGauran said.

 ‘The 150,000 strong Australian Vietnamese community has shown great resilience to overcome the challenges and  hardships endured by many individuals and families.

 ‘Through hard work and determination, Vietnamese refugees have created better lives and a bright future in Australia.

 ‘The vast majority of Vietnamese refugees have also demonstrated their commitment to their new home with 96%  becoming Australian citizens,’ Minister McGauran said.

 Today, Vietnamese Australians marked the special occasion at a reception in the Great Hall of Parliament House in 

 Canberra, hosted by the Vietnamese Community in Australia - NSW Chapter (VCA).

 ‘We should all recognise the valuable contribution Australians of Vietnamese heritage have made to our country,  economically and socially.

 ‘Our current Young Australian of the Year, Khoa Do, is an example of the high results achieved by many Vietnamese  refugees who now call Australia home.

 ‘I applaud the efforts and the contribution made by Australia’s Vietnamese community over the last 30 years,’ Minister  McGauran said.
