 Treasurer

 Press Conference

 Treasury Place, Melbourne

 Thursday, 9 June 2005 12.00 noon

 SUBJECTS: Labour force, GST, Commonwealth Games, Victorian High Country, Housing market, Chinese diplomat

 TREASURER:

 Today’s labour force figures show that unemployment in the month of May remains at a 29 year low at 5.1 per cent. And in the  month, around about another 14,000 jobs were created, nearly all of them part-time, but if we look back over the past year,  330,000 new jobs have been created in the Australian economy and nearly 70 per cent of those have been full-time jobs.

 The thing that is the most striking about today’s labour force figures is that the participation rate rose to an all time high. That is,  more people than ever before participating in the workforce and a larger proportion of those of workforce age participating than  ever before. And notwithstanding more people participating, unemployment is still at 29 year lows.

 This is what the Government has been focussing on in recent years, to lift that participation rate, to get as many people as  possible of workforce age participating in the workforce, looking for work and hopefully finding it. Our reforms in relation to  disability support pensions, sole parent’s pension are all designed to lift these participation rates. And you can see from today’s  figures they are at all time highs and unemployment at 29 year lows.

 We would like to lift the participation rate even higher over the decades to come because as the Australian population ages we  need a higher and higher proportion of those of workforce age participating in the labour market and looking for work. So, this is  good news for Australia - unemployment remains low and our participation rate at record highs. It indicates that the economy has  still got some strength in it. The chances of getting a job today are better than they have been for 29 years and the participation  rate is higher than it has ever been recorded.

 JOURNALIST:

 I have got a question on a non-labour force issue.

 TREASURER:

 Sure, whatever you would like.

 JOURNALIST:

 Okay, well Peter Beattie today, or yesterday, was boasting about Queensland driving the nation and offering a hand to other  States if they needed a hand-up. With a billion dollar surplus should he be offering to, his agreement for a different carve up of  GST revenue and if he doesn’t, should there be a different carve up of GST revenue?

 TREASURER:

 Well I think with the strong revenues that Queensland has and the windfall that they get from GST they should be using that  windfall to cut other indirect taxes, and we would urge them to do that in accordance with the Intergovernmental Agreement.  Queensland has indicated that it is going to proceed with cutting those other taxes but you would have to look at it and say, they  have got the capacity to move faster than they have hitherto indicated. But at least they are prepared to move. We still have two  other States that are refusing to use their GST windfalls to cut indirect taxes at all. We will be encouraging those other States to  do so. 

 JOURNALIST:

 What’s the status of that letter of offer from the majority of States and New South Wales and WA standing outside of it? Where are  you up to in the deliberations?

 TREASURER:

 Well, six of the States have made an offer and two are yet to make their offer. So, I think what we will do is we will deal with the  two that have not yet made an offer and we will engage with the six that have.

 JOURNALIST:

 Will you take punitive action against those States though? Or are you saying negotiate (inaudible)?

 TREASURER:

 Well we will announce our response in due course.

 JOURNALIST:

 The 14,000 jobs created - they are nearly all of them part-time - are you concerned there might be a bit of a tip towards part-time  rather than full-time jobs?

 TREASURER:

 Well, as I said, over the past year there have been 330,000 new jobs in the Australian economy and 70 per cent, nearly 70 per  cent, of them have been full-time, that is extraordinary - 330,000 that is more than three “MCG fulls” - 330,000 jobs in the last  year, nearly 70 per cent. Now in this month the job creation was principally in the part-time area, you are quite right. But when you  look back over the year that is because in previous months the job creation has been principally in the full-time area. This is a  very, very strong labour market which is now at 29 year lows with more people participating, looking for work, than ever before.  That is the extraordinary thing - the participation rate of 64.6 per cent.

 JOURNALIST:

 Given other evidence of economic slow-down, did the figures surprise you?

 TREASURER:

 I think most people were thinking that the unemployment rate would go up this month. So this is stronger than was expected and  not only did the rate not go up but the participation rate went up and the unemployment rate remained the same which tells you  more people started looking for work in the month of May and what is more, they were able to find it because the unemployment  rate did not go up. So, this is a strong result, yes. 

 JOURNALIST:

 What does it say about the economy to you?

 TREASURER:

 Well, employment normally is a lagging indicator. What it tells you is we have had terrifically strong, consistent growth and that is  still working its way into good jobs growth. We have said over the course of the next year we would expect the economy to slow a  bit and therefore the employment growth to slow a bit but what this tells you is that there is still strength in the employment market. 

 JOURNALIST:

 The Commonwealth Games, what was discussed in the meeting this morning with Ron Walker?

 TREASURER:

 Well, we discussed some of the programme that the Commonwealth Games is putting on and we also discussed finances. As you  know the Commonwealth Government, the Australian Government, is putting a very large sum of money into the Commonwealth  Games and there was a discussion as to the amounts that are involved.

 JOURNALIST:

 Was this memo discussed - the secret memo?

 TREASURER:

 Sorry?

 JOURNALIST:

 The secret memo that surfaced in the Herald Sun this morning? Was that…

 TREASURER:

 There is no secret memo. There is nothing secret. No it was not discussed. But there is nothing secret.

 JOURNALIST:

 Is there bad blood between the State and Federal Government in regards to this?

 TREASURER:

 No, I do not believe so, no. The Federal Government was asked to make available money - we are making over $100 million  available and the Federal Government was asked to sponsor the baton relay. There is nothing secret about this. The Prime  Minister has launched it, I have launched it, we keep on launching it on a regular basis. So, we were asked to sponsor the baton  relay and we are. That is part of the commitment that we made when we were asked for money - we were asked for money and  one of the things we were asked to do was to sponsor the baton relay. It is not secret. We only wish we could get more coverage.

 JOURNALIST:

 Justin Madden says you are using it as a propaganda exercise and what do you say to that - demanding that MPs get on-stage  every night with the baton?

 TREASURER:

 Well hang on, if you want the Commonwealth Games to be a success it has got to be more than Victoria, it has got to be  Australia. You have got to make this a national thing so that people in New South Wales and Queensland and WA and South  Australia and Tasmania feel part of it. And if you want to engage those people, one of the ways of doing it is to get the baton going  through all of these other States. The Victorian Government cannot run a baton through South Australia or Western Australia or  Queensland or Tasmania - it is only in Victoria - and so the Commonwealth Government was asked, could we sponsor the baton  and arrange for it to go through other States. And we can and we will. We were asked to do that and we will. And that is a way of  getting people outside of Victoria engaged in the Commonwealth Games and if you want this to be a big event, a national event,  and an international event, you have got to get people throughout Australia engaged in it.

 JOURNALIST:

 But wouldn’t normal people, community contributors, be better off on-stage rather than Federal MPs and Senators?

 TREASURER:

 Well, I am sure they will be on-stage, of course they will be. The idea is to get as many people engaged as possible. But  somebody has got to organise it.

 JOURNALIST:

 I am not talking about organising it, I am talking about the actual on stage stuff.

 TREASURER:

 Absolutely.

 JOURNALIST:

 Are you still going ahead with that a very prominent role for the Federal MPs?

 TREASURER:

 No, no, no the MPs are going to organise all runners, who will be members of the community, through their electorates. And they  will be community people, sporting people and local leaders and all the rest of it. The idea is to engage the community.

 JOURNALIST:

 But will they still be on stage?

 TREASURER:

 Who?

 JOURNALIST:

 The Federal MPs and Senators?

 TREASURER:

 Well I don’t know how it is going to be organised. I imagine the runners will be the people who will get the coverage - they are  carrying the baton.

 JOURNALIST:

 Can I ask a question Treasurer just about…?

 TREASURER:

 What stage are you talking about?

 JOURNALIST:

 I am talking about the nightly celebrations where there was a demand that the local, sorry the Federal MPs or Senators will be the  ones who receive the baton at the end of the day at the main celebration.

 TREASURER:

 What major celebration?

 JOURNALIST:

 Well, every night of the baton relay there is a major celebration in whatever town it stops.

 TREASURER:

 Well who is organising that? I do not know anything about it, and I do not know who is organising it.

 JOURNALIST:

 Well it is a demand from the Department, from Senator Kemp’s Department.

 TREASURER:

 I do not anything about it.

 JOURNALIST:

 What do you have to say to Justin Madden then who has the belief that the Federal Government is attempting to hijack the event?

 TREASURER:

 Well I would say this, can Justin Madden organise a baton in Queensland, or South Australia, or New South Wales or  Tasmanian? Patently he can not. And that is why the Games’ organisers asked the Commonwealth Government to do it, and to  pay for it. You know, if somebody wants to say that they do not want our money and they will organise it themselves, we would  have said fine. But if they say we cannot do it, will you pay for it and will you organise it, I think it is only fair that we do, and that  we do it in the interests of Australia. You have got to understand this point. This has got to be bigger than one city and just one  State, this has got to be something for Australia and for the whole of the Commonwealth.

 JOURNALIST:

 Has Ron Walker or the Government, State Government, asked for any extra money over and above what you have already  promised?

 TREASURER:

 Well my experience is that these are always ongoing negotiations.

 JOURNALIST:

 Can I just ask you a question about your legislation re the tax cuts? Parliament resumes next week, what is the Government going  to do? Do you just push ahead with it and then see if Labor blocks it, or how is it going to be played out?

 TREASURER:

 Well the tax cuts legislation has passed the House of Representatives. To become a law it has to pass the Senate. It will pass the  Senate. The only question is does it pass the Senate before the 30th of June, and allow everybody to get their tax cut in three  weeks time, or does Labor delay the tax cut, so that it can only come into effect when it passes the new Senate. Labor cannot  defeat this tax cut. This is the absurdity of Kim Beazley’s position, he cannot stop the tax cut. All he can do is delay the tax cut.  Now the Commissioner of Taxation gave him a lifeline. The Commissioner of Taxation said even if you vote the legislation down, it  can still go ahead as long as you say you will allow the schedules. But he cannot even say that. As of today, nobody in Australia - 

 and apparently not even Mr Beazley - knows whether he will allow the schedules. It is a very simple proposition. I say to Kim  Beazley, just answer this question - will you allow the schedules? If you will, everyone gets a tax cut on the 1st of July. If you  won’t, no-one gets a tax cut on the 1st of July. Millions of Australians need to know - 850,000 employers need to know - will you  allow the schedules? He has had since the 10th of May, and what are we now, the 9th of June, he has now had thirty days to say  yes or no, and he still flip-flops, cannot tell you, he cannot tell you the answer, cannot make up his mind, does not know what is  going to happen. Ten million people cannot be assured, 850,000 employers are put into confusion. I say to Mr Beazley stop the  stunts, you will not defeat these tax cuts. Just allow people to know where they stand.

 JOURNALIST:

 Just on something else, as a Victorian MP, do you have any thoughts on the high country cattlemen who are rallying just a block  away in the city?

 TREASURER:

 Well I have got a lot of sympathy for the high country cattlemen. I think the high country cattlemen are part of our history and our  legacy, and I think they do care for the high country, and I just cannot believe we are ending what has been a wonderful chapter in  Victorian history. Cattlemen and horsemen caring for the high country. Wonderful, beautiful country, in the way they have been  doing for a century, and now are having their livelihoods stripped away from them. It is a sad day I think. A very sad day, and I say  to the mountain cattlemen you have been a big part of Australia’s history, and I hope you will be for a long time.

 JOURNALIST:

 Do you dispute the scientific evidence that it is bad for the environment in the high country?

 TREASURER:

 Well look, it has been going on for a long time and the high country is still there.

 JOURNALIST:

 Mr Costello, what do you make of Petro Georgiou’s speech last night?

 TREASURER:

 I did not hear it.

 JOURNALIST:

 I think he was highly critical of the immigration department.

 TREASURER:

 Well I did not hear his speech, sorry.

 JOURNALIST:

 Do you have any views on the Chinese diplomat who is trying to seek asylum in Australia? What is your view on that Treasurer?

 TREASURER:

 Well my view is that if the man concerned faces persecution, then he would be eligible for protection, and we would not want to  see anybody that would be subject to persecution, and so this is a matter to be assessed by the relevant authorities. If he faces  persecution, he would now be entitled to protection, and he ought to be given protection. That is a question that will have to be  determined by the relevant officials in the way they determine all of these claims. But as I say, we would not want to see anybody  face persecution.

 JOURNALIST:

 What about the claim for political asylum?

 TREASURER:

 Well that is different, and as I understand it, he is now being considered on the grounds of persecution, is now being handled as a  claim under the refugee convention, and it should be handled in that way, and a proper determination should be made on this  case as it should be in the case of all others.

 JOURNALIST:

 You don’t think he has got a claim for political asylum?

 TREASURER:

 Well it is not up to me to decide these things. Those applications go to the Foreign Minister and as I understand it he has made a  statement on how that, on whether that claim was made and he has already made a statement in relation to that.

 JOURNALIST:

 There is evidence this morning that housing prices could stagnate for up to a decade with potentially dire consequences  presumably for spending in the economy. Do you have view on that potential?

 TREASURER:

 We will make this the last question. There is no doubt in my mind that the housing market is plateauing, that prices are no longer  rising at the unsustainable rates they were, that approvals have come off, and credit (inaudible) come off, that auction clearance  rates have risen. This is no bad thing. Prices were rising too fast, and they were rising in an unsustainable way, so we can have  an orderly slow down in the housing market. That is actually a good thing. It is a good thing for the economy, and to date it has  been quite orderly, and I would expect that to continue on for a while, until the market prices and the supply get back into some  kind of equilibrium. We have been expecting that, and I think that the sources of growth in the Australian economy will increasingly  switch from domestic sources to international sources. We are beginning to see that on the export front, and if that happens in an  orderly way that will be a good rebalancing of the Australian economy. Thanks.
