 AUSTRALIA ESTABLISHES DIPLOMATIC TIES   WITH THE WORLD’S NEWEST NATION   

 

 Today Australia formally established diplomatic relations with the world’s newest nation,  the Republic of South Sudan.   

 In a meeting in the margins of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, the  Foreign Minister, Kevin Rudd, signed a joint communiquÃ© with his South Sudanese  counterpart, Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Minister Nhial Deng Nhial, to  formalise the relationship between the two countries.   

 Australia and South Sudan already share close ties, underpinned by a South Sudanese  community in Australia of some 20,000 people.   

 There is considerable potential to develop the commercial relationship. In addition to vast  oil reserves, South Sudan has largely unexploited agricultural and mineral resources and will  have substantial infrastructure needs as it builds the country's infrastructure.  Australian  companies are well-placed to assist in this process.   

 “Australia is a committed friend and partner of South Sudan,” said Mr Rudd.   

 "As well as providing sanctuary to refugees from South Sudan during the many years of  conflict, Australia is assisting the fledgeling state to deliver basic services such as education,  maternal health and sanitation."   

 “Independence for South Sudan marks an important milestone.  But South Sudan faces  immense challenges to bring peace, stability and development for its people.”   

 The Australian Government has offered to contribute 25 Australian Defence Force and ten  Australian Federal Police personnel to the new United Nations Mission in South Sudan  (UNMISS).

 Two Australian Civilian Corps (ACC) stabilisation advisers will also shortly deploy to South  Sudan to support reconstruction and stabilisation.   

 “The Australian Government remains deeply concerned at the ongoing serious violence in  the border states of Southern Kordofan, including in the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile,”  said Mr Rudd.   

 "Sudan and South Sudan must redouble their efforts to resolve outstanding matters  peacefully by negotiation, not unilateral action.”
