 8 0 .0 0 0  PLACES IN 19 92/93 MIGRATION PROGRAM

 The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Gerry  Hand, announced today that Australia would select up to 8 0 ,00 0 migrants in  1 9 9 2 /9 3  - 3 1 ,0 0 0  fewer than for the current year. Mr Hand confirmed that the  program outcome for 1 9 9 1 /9 2  would be 1 1 1 ,0 0 0  places.

 The 1 9 9 2 /9 3  program would provide 4 5 ,0 0 0  places for family migrants, 2 3 ,8 0 0  for skill migrants, 1 0 ,0 0 0  for those in the Refugee, Humanitarian and  Special Assistance stream and 1,200 in the Special Eligibility category (see  Attachment for details).

 Mr Hand said that the Government strongly supports an ongoing immigration  program.

 "W e consider it essential to Australia's future," he said. "However, the program  must be one that is targeted to meet national economic and social needs.

 "The Government believes a program of 8 0 ,0 0 0  places meets these priorities."

 Immigration must be sensitive to the changes occurring within the Australian  economy associated with industry and award restructuring, the Minister said.

 "Just as Australian workers are being asked to respond to the demands of a  more highly skilled workforce so must the skill elements of our immigration  program be targeted to meet higher skill requirements," he said.

 "The Government is introducing a package of measures that enhances labour  market targeting; increases the emphasis on English language proficiency and  skills; and provides an incentive for those arriving in Australia to upgrade their  English."

 The Government remains committed to encouraging successful business people  to migrate to Australia under the Business Skills category introduced on 17  February 1992.

 Changes to the Independent and Concessional Family points tests

 M r Hand said that the Independent and Concessional Family categories were  designed to supplement the Australian labour market with a broad range of  skills. There is a need to ensure that these skills are targeted to  anticipate  e ffe c tiv e ly  c u rre n t and fu tu re  la bour m a rk e t re q u ire m e n ts .

 - an increase of five points in the pool entrance mark and of ten points in  the priority and pass marks in both categories; - an increase in the skill points for occupations on the Priority Occupation  List from 75 to 80; - the elimination of the 4 0  point skill factor score; - the introduction of 10 negative skill points for principal applicants who 

 are medical practitioners.

 Mr Hand said the pool entrance marks will be 90 points for Concessional Family  and 100 points for Independent migrants. The priority and pass marks will be  100 points for Concessional Family and 110 points for Independent migrants.

 "Changes to the skill weightings will enhance selection of people with skills  required in the labour market," the Minister said.

 "An increase in points for priority occupations is a forward-looking measure  which will provide greater responsiveness to emerging labour market  requirements as the economy improves.

 "The elimination of the 40-point skill factor will ensure that only applicants  whose skills meet the entry requirements of their occupation in Australia will be  selected."

 Details of the points selection systems applying from 1 July 1992 are attached. 

 Greater emphasis on English language

 Mr Hand pointed to the increasing importance of English as a key factor in  employment, particularly in the light of industry and award restructuring, and in  wider settlement. This was highlighted by the recent consultations and  supported by research by the Bureau of Immigration Research which has  emphasised that migrants with limited English speaking ability are  disadvantaged on a range of labour market criteria. Accordingly, the  Government has decided to implement strategies to achieve a higher level of 

 English competence amongst Independent and Concessional Family applicants,  which have a heavier emphasis on labour market requirements. The Minister  emphasised that none of these measures would apply in the Preferential Family  category and the humanitarian stream. The changes include:

 - an increase from 15 to 20 points for applicants in the Independent  category who are proficient in English; - a mandatory English requirement for Independent and Concessional  Family principal applicants with occupations where English is critical to 

 the performance of the position, including for health or public safety  reasons. Principal applicants will be required to be vocationally proficient  in English; - principal applicants and their dependants in the Independent and the 

 Employer Nomination categories and principal applicants only in the

 Concessional Family category who do not have functional ability in  English (a lesser standard than that required on occupational grounds  above) will be required to pre-pay the full or part costs of language  training in Australia.

 "The increased weighting for English proficiency in the Independent category  and the identification of occupations where English is required of all principal  applicants emphasise the importance of this requirement in the selection of  skilled applicants," Mr Hand said.

 "Amendments to the pool entry, pass and priority marks will take effect for all  applications assessed on and from 15 May 1992. Other points adjustments will  affect all applications assessed on and from 1 July 1992. I will make a further  announcement on the timing and extent of cost recovery in the Adult Migrant 

 English Program later this year.

 "The Government remains committed to maintaining comprehensive adult  migrant English services in Australia to ensure social justice for all Australians.

 "The package of measures will ensure that those who are most in need are able r . ~ to access the services." · . z

 Migration of medical practitioners

 The Minister said the Australian Health Ministers' Conference has adopted a Ï

 national workforce strategy to achieve structural reform of Australia's medical  workforce. ' ' ·

 In part, this strategy called for a reduction in the number of overseas trained  doctors migrating to Australia and action to reduce the reliance of health  services on overseas-trained doctors temporarily resident in Australia.

 He said the Government will reduce the number of overseas trained doctors by  the adjustments in the points test detailed above and will enhance mechanisms  to better control the temporary entry of doctors through wider use of Labour  Agreements.

 The Refugee. Humanitarian and Special Assistance program

 Mr Hand said that the 1 0 ,0 0 0  places allocated represented 12.5 per cent of the  program compared to 10.8 per cent allocated in 1991/92.

 "Australia has an outstanding record in responding to refugee and humanitarian  situations overseas, and we have accepted increasingly the need to provide  temporary asylum to applicants within Australia who claim asylum because of a  fear of persecution in their homelands," he said.

 "Australia's humanitarian response acknowledges all these elements. The  provision of temporary refuge in Australia must influence the number of  refugees that can be resettled from overseas."

 The Minister stressed that although people granted temporary refuge in  Australia have the potential to make a positive contribution to the community  they also place an economic and social burden on the community.

 Net addition of 7 0 .0 0 0  people expected

 Mr Hand emphasised that the Migration Program is only one element of  population flow  into and out of Australia.

 "The recent report of the National Population Council on Population Issues and  Australia's Future, which is to be considered by Government in the context of  Ecologically Sustainable Development, noted that there are also significant  additions to our population through temporary entry and visitor movement  which, although they confer significant benefits to Australia, also add pressure  on our resources," he said.

 "The impact of the 1 9 9 2 /9 3  program and other long term movements to  Australia is estimated to provide a net addition to Australia's population of  around 7 0 ,0 0 0  people resulting in a population growth rate of around 1.2 per  cent."
