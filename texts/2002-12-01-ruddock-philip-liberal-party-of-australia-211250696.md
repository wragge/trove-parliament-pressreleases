 Labor Recycles Failed Policies

 MPS 105/2002

 Labor's intentions on border control and asylum seeker policy indicate they have learned nothing from their past mistakes the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock said today.

 The Opposition Leader's insistence on bringing back a coast guard policy for border control is simply recycling failed ideas from the last election.

 Other ideas outlined today on Meet the Press suggest the Opposition has a long way to go in developing workable policies to deal with unauthorised arrivals.

 Labor's policies are irrelevant in relation to the current detainee population, with only four unauthorised arrivals awaiting a primary decision from the Department. Those four are waiting on character issues to be resolved.

 In the early 1990s Labor abandoned a policy of setting a time limit of 273 days on processing and detention of unauthorised arrivals because it became unworkable and was subject to very costly litigation and compensation claims.

 Setting a time limit of 90 days for processing will invite further litigation. Applicants will have little incentive to cooperate with processing because they know Labor's hand would be forced after 90 days, irrespective of the assistance they give.

 The Opposition is arguing for faster processing but has not been willing participants in Government moves to shorten processing times by reducing the amount of litigation, which is where the real delays occur. The average combined time for immigration matters to be dealt with by the Federal Court and Full Federal Court is about a year.

 The challenge for the Opposition is to spell out how they will achieve their objectives, when their policies will add to further litigation and cost to the Australian taxpayer.

 There are also serious questions on Labor's proposal to monitor failed asylum seekers sent home. If there are credible concerns that someone will face persecution because they are a refugee, Australia would not be sending them home in the first place.

 Many thousands of failed asylum seekers leave Australia each year, so the Opposition is proposing a system that will challenge the sovereignty of nations and within a few years would be attempting to track tens of thousands of people around the world.
