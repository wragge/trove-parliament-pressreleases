 ALAN CABMAN M.P.   SHADOW MINISTER FOR   IMMIGRATION & ETHNIC   AFFAIRS

 SELECTION FOR MIGRATION

 "There has been many comments on the criteria for selection   of migrants and refugees based on the statements of   Mr Ruxton", Mr Alan Cadman MP, Shadow Minister for   Immigration and Ethnic Affairs said today.

 "Australia must never have a policy of selection based on   racial grounds. It is the quality of the individual that is   most important to Australia. -

 "Australia must never have terrorists or political   extremists being given the opportunity of coming as settlers   but we cannot tolerate the probing of political, religious   or racial attitudes as part of a selection criteria. The   current Government has adopted a policy of selecting   migrants from South Africa based on attitudes to apartheid.  

 The Government seems intent on having a "thought police"   mentality in selecting migrants from South Africa and that   is unacceptable. '

 "The United Nations has not classified South Africa as a  country from which there are political refugees but the   Government has chosen to allow special humanitarian cases   who are "victims of apartheid" to gain entry into Australia.

 "The Opposition rejects apartheid as a policy and rejects   the apartheid policy of the South African Government. The   rejection of these policies cannot be given expression by   probing the personal attitudes of South Africans seeking   migrant entry into Australia but any extremists, black or  

 white, would be most unwelcomed here." '

 Alan Cadman MP  12 January 1987
