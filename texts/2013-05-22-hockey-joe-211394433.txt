 SPEECH 

 

 HON JOE HOCKEY MP  SHADOW TREASURER   

 ADDRESS TO THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB  GREAT HALL, PARLIAMENT HOUSE  WEDNESDAY 22 MAY 2013 

 **CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY** 

 Introduction 

 After 31 years selling menswear in Chatswood, in the heart of my electorate, my cousin told 

 me on the weekend that he has to close his doors.  

 The business has gone broke. 

 Gus first started work in the rag trade when he was 21. He has always been very good at what 

 he does. 

 Gus  and his  wife Karen have changed their business  as  times  have changed on them. They 

 have built up a loyal clientele. Repeat business is the best business. 

 And their small business has paid for their home. 

 Their small business has paid for their children’s education. 

 Their small business has employed many others over the years. 

 It would be wrong to blame the government or any single person for the shop closing.  

 But it all adds up. 

 A  mix  of  higher  rents,  more  demanding  suppliers,  lower  margins and  the  development  of  

 online sales have all made life tougher.  

 2 

 

 The shopping centre owner wants more flexible trading hours but employment laws offer less 

 flexibility. 

 And the costs  of business  keep going up and up and up, much of  it  driven by Government 

 policies. 

 But ultimately it is also true that customers just haven’t been spending the money they once 

 were. And why is that?  

 Well for starters customers are nervous.  

 They are far more careful with their money.  

 They distrust their government.  

 They don’t know what new tax or new regulation is around the corner that will change their 

 lives and the viability of the business they own or work in.  

 The  stability  and  certainty  that  Australians  enjoyed  up  until  2007  has  been  replaced  by 

 volatility and unpredictability.  

 Times have changed. 

 But despite his deep despondency, Gus finished his phone call declaring that we still live in 

 the best country in the world. Tomorrow, he said, must be better.  

 And Ladies and Gentlemen I am here to promise you that tomorrow will be better. 

 But we need a change of Government to make that happen. 

 If we have the honour of being elected the Coalition will work hard, day and night, to make 

 our country better. 

 We will build a strong budget to build a strong economy. 

 And we must return stable, predictable, AND honest government to Australia. 

 Stability does not come from a Labor Government that has had five small business ministers 

 in fifteen months.  

 3 

 

 Predictability does  not  come when  policies  like tax  cuts  are  announced in one  Budget  then  

 reversed without shame or embarrassment in the next. 

 Honesty does  not  come  when  a  Prime  Minister  and  her  Treasurer  promise  there  will  be  no 

 carbon tax then introduce one as soon as they are re-elected.  

 And honesty does not come when a government excuses its past profligacy on the promise of 

 a surplus - but  then not  only fails to deliver one,  but  delivers  a $19bn  deficit  with more to  

 come. 

 We cannot allow our country to be governed for the next decade and beyond by the legacy of 

 a bad Labor government. 

 

 A Budget Which Lacks Integrity 

 The  Government’s sixth  budget  fundamentally  lacks  integrity. Like  everything  else,  they  

 have over promised and under delivered.  

 Let me give you five reasons why you can’t believe the Budget promises. 

 Firstly, they have broken the most solemn promise already. 

 On  over  500  occasions they  boasted  that  they  were  delivering  a  surplus this  year  and the 

 Prime Minister even boasted that the surplus had already been achieved. 

 

 4 

 

 But this budget has just delivered more deficit and debt. In fact it is a $20 billion deterioration 

 in just six months. 

 Next years forecast surplus of $2.2 billion has now become a deficit of $18 billion. Again a 

 deterioration of $20 billion. 

 Now the  government  expects  you to believe that  they will  deliver a  modest  surplus  in four  

 years time, that is after two more elections. 

 It would be comical if it wasn’t so tragic.  

 That  means  7  straight  budget  deficits  from  Labor. That  is  the  longest  period  of  successive  

 deficits by one government in more than a generation.     

 Secondly, even  if  we were  to  believe  the  new  numbers,  the  government  will  continue  to  

 borrow more money. 

 

 The headline budget balance takes into account all of the government’s spending decisions, 

 including  for  those  projects  which  are  considered  to  be  “off  budget”  such  as  the  National  

 Broadband Network and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. 

 It proves that Labor will never balance the books and will never stop borrowing money for at 

 least the next four years.  

 Thirdly, under Labor, gross debt, that is the money we actually have to repay, has been going 

 up and up.   

 5 

 

 The face value of Commonwealth securities  on issue will pass  $300 billion within the next 

 four years. 

 The government has already increased the debt limit on four occasions, firstly to $75 billion, 

 then $200 billion, then $250 billion and then $300 billion. On each occasion they said they 

 would never break the limit.  

 Now the price we will pay is $35 million a day in interest. That’s $13 billion a year. That is 

 more than enough to cover the full year costs of the NDIS without a levy. 

 The budget papers indicate that the debt limit will have to be increased again at some point - 

 but the government doesn’t have the courage to ask the parliament for yet another increase in 

 the credit card limit before the election. 

 Fourthly,  in  addition  to  the obvious  deterioration in  Budget  outcomes, the Budget itself 

 makes some courageous assumptions about the future. 

 

 For example, net receipts from the MRRT (mining tax) are forecast to be just $200 million 

 this year.  That is less than 10% of the $3 billion forecast in last year’s budget. 

 But despite this massive shortfall, and wide-spread views that the commodity price boom is 

 fading, mining  tax revenue  is  forecast  to  rise  strongly  over  the  forward  estimates  to  $2.2  

 billion a year.  

 So the government  wants  you to believe that  revenue will  be  less  than  10%  of  the  forecast  

 this  year, but things  are  going  to  improve so  dramatically that  the  mining tax will  increase  

 tenfold to help deliver a surplus down the track. 

 6 

 

 

 The forecasts for the carbon price also stretch credibility. 

 The carbon pricing scheme links to the European system from July 2015.  Forward prices for 

 European  carbon  permits  in  2016  have  in  recent  days  been  below  6  Australian  dollars  at  

 current exchange rates.   

 The carbon tax revenue forecast for that year is now based on a price of $12.10 - a marked 

 reduction  from  the  originally  forecast  $29  a  tonne  - but  it  still  looks  ridiculously high 

 compared to market expectations. 

 But even stranger, the carbon price is projected to rise in a linear fashion, to $18.60 in 2017, 

 and back up to the modelled price of $38 per tonne by 2020. This is essential for a forecast 

 surplus. 

 Absurdly, the budgeted revenue for the market traded carbon permits has nothing to do with 

 the market. It’s all about a convenient forecast for revenue. 

 Finally, I have  dealt  in  the  Parliament  with some  of  the  more  technical  issues  around  the  

 forecasts  on  nominal  growth and the  terms  of  trade. I  stand  by  my  comments  that  these  

 assumptions look overly optimistic.  

 The sum of all this is that the Government does not have a revenue collection problem … it 

 has a revenue forecasting problem, all of its own creation. 

 You, the Australian people, are not to blame for paying too little tax. The Government is to 

 blame for spending too much of your money. 

 But even when it comes to expenditure the numbers are rubbery. 

 7 

 

 The  government  wants  you  to  believe  they will  pump  more  money into  education  through  

 their Gonski reforms. 

 Yet the budget papers show they are spending nearly $5 bn less on education over the four 

 years to 2016 compared with last year’s budget.   

 All the promised increase in education spending lies beyond the next two elections. 

 It’s all to be delivered by the Labor Government in its fourth term of office. 

 In the meantime the Government is playing a game with the numbers to score political points. 

 In order to achieve their claimed $16.2 billion increase in school funding, they are taking the 

 worst numbers  on the  current  system,  the  best  numbers  on Gonski,  mixing  it  with  heroic  

 assumptions and then placing the funding burden on a government two elections away. 

 For  example,  after  years  of  assuming  for  Budget  purposes  that  the  per  head  funding  for  

 government  schools  would  increase  at  the  ten-year  rolling  weighted  average  - which  had  

 been 5.6% in the mid year update - school funding is now forecast to grow at a flat 4.7%.   

 This abandonment of historic data is completely at odds with the use of historic data for the 

 projected funding costs associated with asylum seeker arrivals. 

 When it comes to boats the Government has taken a ten year average of boat arrivals as the 

 underlying assumption for the final two years of the forward estimates. 

 However, for half that time the Coalition was in Government and an average of three boats 

 arrived  per  year. Given  that  137 boats  have  arrived  this  year  alone and  46 boats  arrived  in  

 April, which was the worst month for boat arrivals ever, how on earth can the Government  

 justify their claims that the costs of boat arrivals will taper off? 

 Labor’s poor management of our borders has now cost taxpayers over $10 billion since they 

 came to office and they are trying to convince people that it will be fixed just as boat arrivals 

 reach record numbers. 

 So,  to  be  very  clear, the  Government  abandons  historic  data  when  it  increases  costs  in  the  

 Budget and then uses historic data when it decreases costs in the Budget.  

 8 

 

 They have junked a long term average for education only to use a long term average for boat 

 arrivals. 

 These  are some  of  the  tricks  that  undermine  the  Budget  and  reflect  poorly  on  this 

 government.  

 With little credibility around the underlying forecasts on revenue and expenditure and with a 

 seemingly generous approach to economic parameters, the reality is that the cupboard is bare. 

 Under Labor the Budget will never come back to surplus. 

 The debt will keep growing. 

 And unpredictable and unstable government will continue. 

 And  because  of  Labor’s determination to  keep  spending  other  people’s  money, if  we  are  

 elected on September 14, obviously we will have little fiscal room to move. 

 Achieving positive structural economic reform often costs money. 

 Whether  it’s  good  structural reform  like  the  phasing  out  of tariffs started by  Hawke  and  

 Keating, or real tax reform like that under the Coalition in 2000, the starting point has to be 

 Australians are financially better off even if the Budget is initially worse off.  

 For  example, when  we  introduced  the  New  Tax  System  in  2000  we  were  collecting  less  

 revenue for the Commonwealth than under the old tax system. This was appropriate because 

 it over compensated the economy for the cost of significant dislocation associated with broad 

 tax change. That is the lesson on how to do real and successful tax reform.  

 Of course some structural reform comes without a Budget cost. 

 For  example, the  floating  of  the  dollar,  the  Campbell  and  Wallis  reforms  to  banking, 

 industrial relations change and even National Competition Policy were all revenue neutral or 

 at little cost to the Budget, but they delivered significant economic benefit. 

 By leaving the cupboard bare, Labor has made it more difficult to deliver structural reform.  

 To build a stronger economy we must first build a stronger Budget. 

 9 

 

 This is why our Commission of Audit will examine both government expenditure and better 

 service delivery. 

 That  is  why,  if  we  are  elected, Tony Abbott  has  made  real  tax  reform, and  COAG  reform, 

 issues for discussion in a first term. But any change will require community endorsement at 

 the subsequent election, for delivery in a potential second term of government. 

 We have to end the wild ride of new taxes, undelivered tax cuts, on again/off again payments, 

 and knee jerk reactive decision making. 

 Let  me  be  very clear,  the  objective  of  the  Coalition,  over  time,  is  to  reduce  the  overall  tax  

 burden on business and taxpayers, not to increase it. This will be the guiding principle of any 

 reforms we seek a mandate to implement. 

 So  my  focus  now  is  firmly  on  what  the Coalition  needs  to  do  to  restore  honesty  in  

 government and sustainable prosperity for all Australians. 

 For  the  good  of  the  country  we  need  to  stop  increasing  Government  debt  as  quickly  as  

 possible.  

 The  government  wants  you  to  believe  that  debt  doesn’t  matter  because  it is  lower  than  in  

 many other developed countries. 

 Well the government doesn’t seem to have noticed that the countries they compare us to are 

 struggling - and they are now deeply regretting their failure to get their houses in order when 

 they could. 

 In a race to the bottom there are no winners. 

 And  we  should  never  forget  that  Australia  had  its  credit  rating  downgraded  twice  under  a  

 previous Labor Government when Commonwealth debt was below the levels it is at now. 

 All  of  you  know  that  while  you  are  borrowing more  and  more  money  to  pay for  everyday  

 expenses you have not got your finances under control. 

 The Coalition will reduce debt in four ways. 

 10 

 

 Firstly, we will balance the books, live within our means and return the budget to surplus as 

 quickly as possible.  

 We will do this by cutting waste and abolishing programs that are unaffordable. 

 To  repair  the  budget  position  and  to  pay for  any  new  initiatives,  the  Coalition  has  already  

 announced an extensive list of budget savings, including: 

 â¢ A 12,000 reduction in public service headcount through natural attrition. 

 â¢ Abolishing the mining tax and associated spending, including the Schoolkids Bonus, 

 the low income $500 superannuation rebate and the deferral of the increase in the 

 superannuation guarantee levy for two years. 

 â¢ A reduction in the humanitarian refugee intake from 20,000 back to 13,750. 

 â¢ Stopping the asylum seeker boats. 

 Because of the fiscal emergency, we reserve the right to legislate any announced government 

 savings in  this Budget and  unlegislated  announcements  from  previous  Budgets that  Labor  

 have already booked. 

 We  also  reserve  the  right  to  not  proceed  with  any  announced  new  spending  in  this  budget  

 unless otherwise specified. 

 Secondly, we will borrow less to fund our more affordable and more achievable NBN. 

 Thirdly, the abolition of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will liberate up to $10 billion 

 of debt over the forward estimates. 

 Fourthly,  we  will  sell  down  the  $10  billion  of  Mortgage  Backed  Securities  on  the  balance 

 sheet of AOFM as market conditions permit, and reduce the associated borrowings. 

 

 Budget Integrity Measures 

 To ensure honesty and transparency the Coalition will initiate further reforms in the reporting 

 of Australia’s fiscal position. 

 11 

 

 We will  task Treasury with including in the budget  papers  a more thorough analysis  of the 

 sensitivity of Budget forecasts to events. 

 Also, as I announced two years ago, the Coalition will ask Treasury to publish information on 

 the  structural  budget  position, including  both  historical  data and  forecasts, in  the  annual 

 budget papers, not on some ad hoc basis.   

 Finally, a Coalition  government  will  publish  full  information  on  the  current  and  projected  

 face value of government securities on issue.  

 Like every household with a mortgage you should always know how much you owe the bank.  

 

 Small Business 

 I come from a small business family. 

 Through my family’s endeavour, that small business gave me a home.  

 It paid my school fees and helped support me through University. 

 It has given my parents some financial freedom in their retirement.  

 Business is the backbone of the Australian economy.  

 Governments do not create jobs …they rely on all of you to do just that.  

 Instead of being at war with business, government should be supportive of business. 

 We should reward and not penalise innovation and success. 

 We should laud achievement, investment and excellence.  

 We should welcome job creation and hard work that is smart and constructive. 

 Abolishing the carbon tax and providing tax cuts will benefit business, and consumers.   

 It will directly reduce the cost of electricity and gas. 

 12 

 

 People will have more money in their pockets.   

 And whilst some consumers and some big businesses have received compensation for 

 the pain of the carbon tax, small business did not get a zack.  

 There was no compensation for these higher costs and many found they were unable to 

 pass them through to consumers.   

 Tony Abbott has already announced that small business will be a cabinet portfolio within the 

 Treasury department. 

 Today I confirm that the Coalition will ensure that Commonwealth departments and agencies 

 meet their obligations to small business suppliers by adopting a ‘pay on time or pay interest’ 

 policy.  

 Labor has made much of its promise to pay small business accounts within 30 days. 

 However, Labor has limited the application of this pledge to formal contractual relationships. 

 Under the Coalition, all small businesses that provide services to the Commonwealth will get 

 the benefit of a ‘pay on time or pay interest’ approach- formal contracts or not. 

 If an account is not paid within the 30 days, interest will be paid at the same rate as the 

 Australian Taxation Office expects people to pay for late tax payments (currently 9.95%). 

 Small businesses work hard for their money and should not be bankrolling government. 

 

 ATO initiatives 

 The  Coalition  will  also foster  a  more  cooperative  relationship  between  taxpayers and  the  

 Australian Taxation Office. 

 We all have to pay our fair share of tax.  But the relationship with the ATO does not have to 

 be adversarial and should be based on mutual respect. 

 13 

 

 One measure  that  will  help  change  the  culture  of  the  tax  office is  to  appoint  people  with  

 business experience to senior posts. The new Commissioner, Chris Jordan, is a breath of fresh 

 air in this regard and the Coalition welcomes his appointment. 

 But for too long the tax office has developed an insular and inward looking culture that has 

 put it at odds with taxpayers, particularly in relation to its overly aggressive interpretations of 

 tax laws. 

 Taxpayers are not the enemy. They should be respected. 

 I  have  previously  announced  that  the  Coalition  would  expand  the  number  of  Second  

 Commissioners of Taxation, from three to seven, with appointments of “outsiders” who have 

 market place experience to the executive group, which sets the strategic direction of the tax 

 office. 

 A second step is to reduce the complexity and increase the certainty of tax law. 

 In areas like self-assessment and compliance we can do better. 

 But when dealing with tax payers the ATO has everything in its favour.  

 When it comes to resources, this year alone, the Government has increased the size of the tax 

 office by over 500 employees to more than 22,000 staff.  

 And when it comes to its legislated powers it all works in favour of the tax office as well. 

 For example if a taxpayer is assessed for tax, the only way the amount can be disputed is if 

 the tax is paid in full (with few exceptions). 

 And  when  there  is  a  dispute  over  an  audit,  the  ATO  can  often  seem  to  go  through  the  

 motions, rather than objectively reconsidering the taxpayer's position. 

 Taxpayers need to know their concerns are heard and they need to be assured that they are  

 being treated fairly. 

 I announce today that if elected a Coalition government will immediately establish a standing 

 Parliamentary Committee with a singular focus - the oversight of tax administration. 

 14 

 

 The first task of the Oversight Committee will be to set down dates for regular semi-annual 

 public hearings with the Commissioner of Tax. They will be held in a format similar to the 

 public hearings with the Governor of the Reserve Bank.  

 The  second  task  will  be  an  enquiry  into  the  most  effective  organisational  structure  for  

 independently handling and resolving formal taxation disputes.  

 As I said last November I have deep reservations about the ATO being both an administrator 

 and a prosecutor. 

 I recognise that the new Commissioner of Taxation, Chris Jordan, is endeavouring to put in 

 place  a  more  independent  dispute  resolution  process.  I  welcome  this  initiative. So  our  

 timeframe  should  allow  a  proper  evaluation  of  the  ATO's  new  approach  to  independent  

 review of disputes.  

 However, if the Oversight Committee believes it’s necessary, then the Coalition stands ready 

 to break up the tax office, so that its policeman functions are separate to its responsibility for 

 administering the tax system. 

 Fairer administration of our tax system should have bi-partisan support. 

 

 Tax Policy Legislation 

 In addition, the Coalition believes there is much room for improvement in the process, design 

 and delivery of taxation legislation. 

 Quality control is crucial and requires accountability. 

 A  Coalition  Government  will  provide  greater  certainty  to  taxpayers  by  requiring  the  

 Commissioner to affirm that all new taxation legislation and related explanatory memoranda 

 accurately  express the  stated  policy  intent  of  the  Government.  The  ATO  will  also  have  to  

 affirm that it has the administrative and compliance systems in place to give practical effect 

 to the Government’s legislation. 

 

 15 

 

 Taxation Reforms 

 The  Coalition  has  already  announced  the  package  of  tax  reforms  on  which  it  is  seeking  a  

 mandate. 

 The Coalition will abolish the Carbon Tax as our first order of business. 

 While  most  of  the  spending  linked  to  the  carbon  tax  will  go,  a Coalition  Government  will  

 keep the tax cuts and fortnightly pension increases without the carbon tax. 

 We  do  so  because  we  believe  it  is  essential  that  the  community,  taxpayers  and  pensioners,  

 have some stability and certainty in their household budgets. 

 And the Coalition will abolish the Mining Tax.  

 A tax that has made life harder and more complex for a mining industry that needs long term 

 stability for its long term capital investment. 

 Predictability  and  stability  is  driving  our  commitment  to  produce  a  comprehensive  white  

 paper on tax reform. 

 There  is  plenty of  room  for  improvement  in  our  tax  system  so  that  it  is fairer,  simpler  and  

 helps deliver lower taxes. 

 Confidence in taxation policy making is at an all time low.  

 When Paul Keating dumped his L_A_W tax cuts we thought it couldn’t get worse. 

 But  when  the  Prime  Minister  introduced  a  carbon  tax  she  promised  would  never  exist,  tax  

 policy making in Australia hit rock bottom.  

 And the Treasurer is no better. He has legislated tax cuts in the last Budget only to take them 

 away in this Budget.  

 So the Coalition has announced a process designed to rebuild honesty in tax policy making. It 

 will be headed by a respected individual from outside the public service. 

 We  will  then take  any  proposals  for  future  tax  reform  to  the  Australian  people  for  their  

 approval in the 2016 election. 

 16 

 

 That’s the way the Coalition does tax reform…we seek voter support at the ballot box. 

 Like so many other things, when it comes to tax, Labor just can’t be trusted. 

 Our positive changes will not stop there. 

 There is so much to do. 

 We will have a Productivity Commission review of workplace relations. 

 We will have a financial  system enquiry, a son of Wallis or granddaughter of Campbell, to 

 lay  out  a  roadmap  for  a  safe,  robust  and  efficient  financial  system  which  will  continue  to  

 meet the financial needs of savers, borrowers and investors. 

 We  will  task  the  Australian  Office  of  Financial  Management  with  exploring  longer  dated  

 issues  of  Commonwealth  Government  securities  to  provide  long  term  investments  for  

 superannuation funds, and to provide an anchor point for longer dated issues of private sector 

 debt. 

 We will make infrastructure a major priority and  we will  work with state  governments  and  

 the private sector to build major projects like WestConnex in Sydney and the East/West Link 

 in Melbourne.  

 This list is just the start. 

 All  of  these  initiatives  will  help  to  lay  down  a  base  for  strong  economic  growth,  a  strong  

 business sector, more jobs and greater prosperity for all Australians. 

 This is what the Coalition does.  

 We will rebuild, step by step, the essential infrastructure of honest government. 

 

 Conclusion 

 As  my cousin  Gus  said  in  his  darkest  of  moments,  Australians  want  tomorrow  to  be  better  

 than today. 

 17 

 

 Australians want their government to reflect their aspirations. 

 And, Australians want their government to reflect the very best qualities of our people.  

 It must start by building a strong Budget. 

 This will help build a strong economy. 

 And with a strong economy we can have a strong Australia. 

 The Coalition has a plan to make our country better. 

 With your support we stand ready to do the job.
