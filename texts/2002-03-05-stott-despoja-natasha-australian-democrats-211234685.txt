 Nuclear-free still the target, 25 years on  

 The Australian Democrats have raised serious questions into security issues around the design and siting of the proposed extra Lucas Heights nuclear reactor, in light of increased terrorism concerns since 11 September 2001.  

 Democrats’ Leader, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, said the Party would use next week’s sitting of Parliament to call for the tabling of documentation regarding the reactor and its security arrangements. The Democrats have not ruled out a Senate inquiry if the Government is not forthcoming with the relevant information.  

 Senator Stott Despoja was speaking tonight at an event celebrating the Democrats’ 25th anniversary at the Melbourne Town Hall.  

 Peter Garrett, President of the Australian Conservation Foundation, gave an address on “25 years of Nuclear Free Politics”, the first in a Speakers’ Series on issues that the Democrats have played a leading role.  

 “1977 was the year the Australian Democrats were founded and entered the Federal Parliament. It was also the year that France performed nuclear tests at Muruora Island, and the Fraser Government decided to allow the mining and export of uranium,” said Senator Stott Despoja.  

 “Opposition to uranium mining and Australia’s role in the nuclear industry was one of the key issues that united the founders of the Australian Democrats. The first policy balloted and passed by the members was an anti-nuclear policy.  

 “The nuclear-free movement is just as important today as it was in 1977 and the Democrats are just as committed.  

 “Whether it is leaks from the Beverley uranium mine or plans for a low level nuclear waste dump in my home state of South Australia, the ongoing battles over the Lucas Heights facility in NSW or the rehabilitation of Kakadu, the Democrats will continue to question the Government, to expose the madness and to oppose Australia’s participation in the nuclear industry.  

 “Australia’s involvement in the nuclear madness is becoming increasingly secretive and political.  

 “Radioactive leaks from uranium mines are met with the same kind of government recalcitrance and even deceit, evident over asylum seekers.  

  “The Democrats have been able to reveal that the Government has no effective waste management strategy for the Lucas Heights reactor, and we have consistently opposed the construction of any new reactor anywhere in Australia,” concluded Senator Stott Despoja.
