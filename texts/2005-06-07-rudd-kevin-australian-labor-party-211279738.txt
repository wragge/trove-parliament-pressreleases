 Kevin Rudd, MP  Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs &  International Security   

 TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW -  MELBOURNE     -   DATE - 07 June 2005   

 E & OE - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:   Chen Yonglin; Polls; Labor frontbench   

 

 RUDD:  I’m  pretty  disappointed  about  the  fact  that  three  days  after  the  case   concerning  Chen  Yonglin  has  broken,  Foreign  Minister  Downer  has  still  not   granted the Federal Opposition a briefing on the facts surrounding this case.   

 

 In  the  past  we’ve  worked  on  a  bipartisan  basis  with  the  Government  on  the   Schapelle Corby matter and on a range of other matters as well.  And on the basis  of  that  we’ve  received  continued  factual  updates  from  the  Government  about   what has gone on in these individual cases.  I’m sorry to report today that hasn’t 

 been extended to us in the case involving Chen Yonglin.     

 On Saturday we contacted Mr Downer’s Department as soon as this matter broke  in  the  national  media  requesting  an  urge nt briefing as soon as possible.  And  here  we  are  three  days  later  and  we  have  no  response  at  all  from  either  the   Minister  or  his  office  or  his  Department.   I  am  deeply concerned  about  the  fact   that  if  the  Government  wants  these  matters  handled  on  a  bipartisan  basis  then   why in heaven do they want to prevent the Opposition from being briefed on the  detail  of  this  case?   Perhaps  they  are  embarrassed  about  some  of  the  details   concerning this case, I just don’t know.    

 The second point I’ll make is this: what we now know from Senator Vanstone the  Immigration Minister is that Mr Downer has already rejected an application for  territorial  asylum.   Under  the  powers  of  the  Foreign  Minister,  as  outlined  most   recently  in  his  annual  report,  the  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs  has  the  power  to   make  determinations  on  the  granting  of  territorial  or  non-territorial  asylum.    Senator  Vanstone  the  Immigration  Minister  has  said  that,  based  on  her   information,  the  application  for  territorial  asylum  has  been  rejected  by  the   Foreign Minister.  She further said that if we want to know the reasons for that  then we should ask the Foreign Minister.  Well, it’s Tuesday and I’m asking the  Foreign  Minister.   What  are  the  Foreign  Minister’s  reasons  for  rejecting  that   application?  So far as I know we don’t have a cogent statement from the Foreign 

 Minister outlining his reasons for that course of action.  Perhaps there are sound  reasons, but we simply do not know, nor does the Australian public know why  that is the case.   

 Another point I’m going to touch on in this matter is the fact that we have this   continuing  controversy  concerning  the  approaches  between  the  Immigration   Department and the Chinese Consulate General.  At some point following Chen  Yonglin  approaching  the  Immigration  Department  in  Sydney,  I  would  have   though  it  would  have  been  easy  for  the  Australian  Government,  from  its  own   diplomatic and consular lists, to establish whether Chen Yonglin was attached to  the  Chinese  Consulate  General  in  Sydney.   If  there  was  some  practical   complication  I  am  unaware  of,  in  the  absence  of  a  briefing  from  the  Foreign   Minister and his Department on this matter, frankly I’m in the dark.   

 More  broadly  can  I  say  this:  our  argument  as  the  Opposition  is  that  Chen   Yonglin’s case should be treated on its individual merits.  Mr Chen’s case should  be  considered  free  from  any  foreign  policy  consideration,  and  free  from  any   trade policy consideration.  It should be considered exclusively on its individual  merits.     

 REPORTER:  [Inaudible]    

 RUDD:  Well, in the absence of a briefing from Mr Downer it is difficult for  me to know all the facts that have been presented in this case.  What we do know  is fact one: Mr Chen did work at the Chinese Consulate General in Sydney; fact  two: he has applied for territorial asylum with the Australian Government; fact  three:  that  has  been  rejected;  fact  four:  it  seems  that  we  have  an  application   pending for a protection visa with Minister Vanstone’s Department; and possibly  fact five, depending on who you believe this morning, a further application for  territorial asylum has been submitted.     

 Frankly  we  need  to  know  what  the  underlying  considerations  are  in  this  case   through  a  full  and  proper  briefing  from  Mr  Downer’s  Department  and  I  don’t   understand  at  all  why  Mr  Downer  is  not  levelling  with  the  Opposition  and   saying what is going on here.   

 REPORTER:  [Inaudible]    

 RUDD:  Well my argument on the general human rights situation in China  is  along  these  lines:   there  has  been  much  progress  in  China  in  the  last  twenty   years or so that I’ve been connected with the country on the independence of the 

 legal system and on human rights practices in China in general.  Leaving to one  side  the  fact  that  Chinese  Government  policies  have  lifted  two  thirds  of  the  

 country out of poverty.  But the bottom line remains that human rights abuses in  China continue.  That is based on independent reports provided by, for example,  the  United  States'  State  Department,  and  as  provided  by  international  Non-Government  Organisations  such  as  Amnesty  International.   That  therefore  is  a   key underlying factor.   

 

 Now,  when  we  therefore  look  at  Mr  Chen’s  individual  application,  those   considerations, I am sure, should weigh heavily on decision makers concerning  Mr  Chen’s  case.   But  I  repeat,  we  have  not  yet  been  briefed  on  the  facts  

 concerning this case.   

 REPORTER:  [Inaudible]    

 RUDD:   I  think  what  Ambassador  Fu  was  saying  and  doing  was  acting  as   the  Chinese  Government  representative  in  Australia.   She  has  a  professional   function  to  perform,  which  is  to  argue  the  interests  of  her  Government.   That   would be the expectation of any Ambassador resident in Australia today.     

 On the question of human rights and on the question of human rights practices  in China, I’ve said  that what my view is and what the Opposition’s view is; it’s  also  a  view  I  believe  is  shared  by  many  in  the  international  community.   But   what  I’m  uncertain  is  how  those  general  circumstances  apply  to  the  specific   details of Mr Chen’s case.  That’s why I would really like Mr Downer to give us a  briefing. 

 

 REPORTER:  [Inaudible]    

 RUDD:   I  heard  Ambassador  Fu  interviewed  on  that  last  night  on   Australian  television  and  I  was  only  vaguely  aware  of  the  so-called  Xiamen   corruption  case  and  that  is  just  through  my  knowledge  of  Chinese  politics.   As   for the Australian connection with that, I was completely unaware of that, and I  have nothing further to add, but it is one of the matters I will be raising with the  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  if  and  when  Mr  Downer  extends  to  us  the   courtesy of giving us a briefing.   

 REPORTER:  [Inaudible]    

 RUDD:   If  Mr  Downer  has  taken  that  decision  which  Minister  Vanstone   says  he  has,  to  deny  Mr  Chen  territorial  asylum,  then  surely  Mr  Downer  has  a   responsibility  to  tell  Australians  what  his  grounds  were.   Now  perhaps  you,   ladies  and  gentlemen  of  the  press,  are  aware  of  some  statement  from  him  this   morning on that.  I am not, but it would be very useful if he were to make his  position his position plain. 

 

 REPORTER:  [Inaudible]    

 RUDD:   There  are  two  courses  of  action  available  to  the  Australian   Government.   One  is  the  so-called  territorial  asylum,  sometimes  called  political   asylum route.  The other relates to the protection visa arrangements provided for  in the Migration Act.   

 

 On the first of those courses of action, it is important that the Foreign Minister as  the  decision  maker  weigh  carefully  all  the  factors  in  this  case.   And  if  he  has   already decided negatively, then he has responsibility to outline, I would think,  to the Australian community what the reasons for his decisions were.  It may be  that the Government internally has decided that the best way to handle this case 

 is through the protection visa arrangements outlined in the Migration Act.  If that  is  so,  then  they  should  explain  why  they  have  taken  that  course  of  action.   The   protection  visa  arrangements  of  the  Migration  Act  are  outlined  very  carefully   and  clearly  in  the  relevant  sections  of  the  Migration  Act,  and  they  in  turn  are   anchored  in  to  provisions  of  the  Refugee  Convention  of  1951.   Australia  has   international  legal  obligations  under  that  Convention  to  handle  this  case   carefully according to the criteria outlined in the bill and the Convention.   

 REPORTER:  [Inaudible]    

 RUDD:   My  view  of  China’s  relationship  with  Australia  is,  and  I’ve  been   involved in this relationship in one capacity or another for the past twenty years.  that it is strong enough, it is robust enough and it is old enough to handle these  sorts of challenges.  My argument is that the right things should be done by this  individual based on the merits of his case and that when a decision is made on  Mr  Chen’s  future,  that  decision  should  not  be  influenced  by  foreign  policy   considerations and should not be influenced by trade policy considerations.   

 REPORTER:  [Inaudible]    

 RUDD:  I’ve got no basis to make that comment because as I said before, we  still  don’t  have  a  briefing  from  Mr  Downer  on  the  details  concerning  this  case.    But  I’ll  just  add  one  point  though:  when  it  comes  to  the  granting  of  protection   visas to Chinese citizens under the terms of the Migration Act that I referred to  before, which in turn comes out of the Refugee Convention of 1951, Australia has  already  granted  in  the  last  twelve  months  77  protection  visas  for  Chinese   nationals.  We’ve granted more than a hundred such protection visas to Iranians  and  some  forty-plus  to  citizens  of  Afghan  origin.   It  is  not  as  if  we  are  without   precedent  here  in  terms  of  the  application  of  protection  visa  arrangements  to   people from the Peoples’ Republic of China.   

 

 REPORTER:  [Inaudible]    

 RUDD:   I  think  polls  go  up  and  down  more  often  than  the  price  of  petrol.    The challenge for us is not the next two weeks ahead, the challenge for us is the  next  two  years  ahead,  and  to  make  sure  we  are  in  a  position  to  put  before  the   Australian people a clear, concise, alternative view for Australia’s future, and we  intend to do that.   

 REPORTER:  [Inaudible]    

 RUDD:  As I said, polls come and polls go. I’ve been around long enough to  know  that  what  you  look  out  for  in  opinion  polls  is  trends  over  many  months,   and frankly if there is an opinion poll result today which has a particular set of  numbers then I don’t think we should read too much into that.  The key thing for  us is that polls come and go, they go up and down like the price of petrol, and  we  need  to  make  sure  that  we  have  our  case  in  order  to  put  to  the  Australian   people on the economy, on education, on health, and on national security, then  we’ve got the Australian people in two years time at the next election.   

 REPORTER:  [Inaudible]    

 RUDD:   As  far  as  the  composition  of  the  front  bench  is  concerned,  that  is   entirely  within  Kim  Beazley’s  call  and  I’ve  got  no  comment  to  make  on  that   whatsoever.   

 REPORTER:  [Inaudible]    

 RUDD:   Absolutely.   These  matters  were  resolved  by  the  Australian  Labor   Party in January this year and I think any question such as the one you have just  put is without foundation.   

 REPORTER:  [Inaudible]    

 RUDD:  He’s doing a very good job.  What Kim has done is actually bring a  whole  lot  of  stability  to  the  way  in  which  the  Labor  Party  has  conducted  its   debates  since  January  this  year.   It’s  no  secret  to  people  in  the  media  that  we   went  through  a  very  difficult  patch  leading  up  to  January  this  year.   Kim  has   succeeded through strong leadership inside the Party, to stabilise the Australian  Labor Party and enabled it to get on with the business of policy development for  the future. 

 

 REPORTER:  [Inaudible]  

 

 RUDD:   Let’s  face  it,  we’re  six  months  into  a  three  year  term  and  as  I  say   polls  come  and  go,  and  I  don’t  think  you  can  read  too  much  into  one  set  of   numbers.   As  far  as  the  series  of  polls  is  concerned  by  Fairfax,  they’ve  had   different  stories  to  tell  over  the  past  few  months.  Who  knows  what  we’ll  be   saying over the next few months?  They come and they go, they go up and they  go  down;  frankly  what  we’re  concerned  about  is  how  we  are  positioned  as  we   approach the next election which is two years away.   

 REPORTER:  [Inaudible]    

 RUDD:  What this most recent sort of poll may say is not something that we  need to focus on; what we need to focus on is having our message right for the  Australian people over the next couple of years.  That’s our challenge.   

 REPORTER:  [Inaudible]    

 RUDD:   My  position  on  that  is  quite  clear.   I  think  what  the  Australian   people are expecting of us as we approach the next election is a clear message on  the economy, a clear message on tax, and let me tell you, they are going to have  one. 

 

 REPORTER:  [Inaudible]    

 RUDD:  All questions concerning reshuffles lie exclusively with the leader,   Kim  Beazley.   I  have  absolutely  zero  comment  to  make  on  that  one  way  or  the   other.   

 REPORTER:  [Inaudible]    

 RUDD:  Kim’s got a very good team and he has shown good leadership in  what has been a difficult season for Labor coming out of the events of January  this year. Thank you. 

 

 

  Ends.
