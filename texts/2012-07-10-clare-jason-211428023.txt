 TOPICS: Helicopter maintenance contract; DCP; DLA Piper Volume 1 release; carbon pricing; Greens political  party; asylum seekers; turning back the boats

 STEPHEN SMITH:       Thanks very much for turning up. I’m very pleased to be here at Sikorsky Helitech with  Jason Clare, the Minister for Defence Materiel, also Minister for Home Affairs. And we’re announcing today, the  signature between Sikorsky and the Commonwealth for $124 million worth of maintenance for our Black  Hawks and our Seahawks - two of our very important workhorses so far as our helicopter fleet is concerned.  The Black Hawk, of course, is now a famous platform and in very many respects iconic not just for the work  that it does assisting our troops in combat circumstances but also for the work that it does during  humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.

 And that particularly applied in the aftermath of Cyclone Yasi, where we saw the Black Hawks doing  tremendous work in very difficult and dangerous conditions often, in the aftermath of that disaster in  Queensland last year. So, a $124 million contract. That’ll ensure local jobs, investment into Brisbane and  Queensland, and that’s a very good thing, with Brisbane and Queensland now becoming very much a centre of  helicopter maintenance and aviation maintenance. So, Jason and I are very pleased to have witnessed the  signing of that contract just a few moments ago. Jason and I are also announcing today that we are releasing  the Public Defence Capability Plan. As we announced recently, this Defence Capability Plan will be over a four-year period covering the forward estimate years, so it reflects the detail which we outlined in the course of the  Budget.

 And, as we announced recently, this will shortly be followed by a six-year Defence Capability Guide. That’ll  provide greater certainty to industry. Producing the Defence Capability Plan over a four-year period, matching  the forward estimates and also containing a guide for work over the following six years, is a result of our  consultations with industry earlier this year. And those details will be placed, as we speak, on the Defence  website so that industry will now have the 2012 online Defence Capability Plan. Since the White Paper in 2009,  we’ve now seen four revisions of the capability plan, two revisions in 2010 and a revision last year. The plan  itself covers some 111 projects and if you calculate the value of all of those projects through the project life  it’s over $153 billion. So, a substantial amount of work so far as industry is concerned.

 There are also a number of other capability announcements that Jason and I are making but they’re produced  in the materials for you and you’ve got those to read. Finally today, I’m also releasing, consistent with  provisions of the Freedom of Information legislation, releasing all of the first part of the DLA Piper report, and  an updated section provided to me in April by DLA Piper. We’ve seen in recent times the release of an  Executive Summary of the first part of DLA Piper’s work into sexual and other serious abuses in Defence. Last  month we saw the release through Freedom of Information legislation of the entire Executive Summary of the  first volume of DLA Piper’s work, and I indicated at that time that people should expect or anticipate that more  materials would be published. And today, other than some redactions which are, on legal advice, consistent  with Freedom of Information legislation and consistent with personal privacy arrangements, those materials  will be placed on the Defence website.

 I’ve done that because the Government is now focusing on the second volume - the final volume of DLA  Piper’s work which I received in late April and, as I’ve indicated in recent days, the Government is not too far  away from coming to final conclusions on the work of DLA Piper. And all of those options I’ve previously  spoken about- from existing processes to a Royal Commission-remain on the table. The Attorney-General and  I, as I’ve said in recent times, are not too far away from making final conclusions in this area. So, those  further materials which underline the seriousness and the sensitivity and the complexity of what we’re dealing  with will be placed on the Defence website in the course of the morning.

 I’ll ask Jason to make some remarks on those capability matters and then we’re happy to respond to your  questions. Jason?

 JASON CLARE:            Thanks very much Stephen. Queensland plays a very important role for the Australian  Defence Force. Most of our troops are based here in Queensland - in Townsville and in Brisbane. Our frontline  fighters, the Super Hornets, are based here in Brisbane, along with our C-17s and our new multi-role refuelling 

 aircraft. We train for our Black Hawk helicopters here in Queensland as well. They’re just a couple of examples.

 Queensland also plays a very important role for the defence industry. We maintain a lot of military equipment  here and it creates a lot of jobs for Queenslanders. This contract is just one example of that. It’s a four-year  contract worth $124 million, employs around about 130 people here at Sikorsky, maintaining, doing the deep  level maintenance for our Black Hawk and our Seahawk helicopters. It’s good news for the workers here in  Brisbane. It’s also good news for the people of Queensland.

 Stephen mentioned the natural disasters of last year, the cyclone but also the floods, and everybody will  remember the work that the Black Hawks did to rescue people, to save lives over the course of that terrible  summer last year. And that work was able to happen because of the work done by Army, because of the work  done by the Boeing maintenance crew, and because of the work that was done here by the Sikorsky deep level  maintenance group. It’s that work that gets the Black Hawks and the Seahawks up in the air that ultimately  saves Australian lives. So, I’d like to thank the team for all the work they did last year and this contract, this  new contract, is a credit to the great work that they’re doing.

 STEPHEN SMITH:       Thanks, Jason. We’re happy to respond to your questions.

 JOURNALIST:  Minister, the Treasurer said that 1 July would be a game-changer. Why haven’t the latest polls  [indistinct] that?

 STEPHEN SMITH:       Well, just as the world didn’t end on 1 July, as Tony Abbott was predicting, so no one  was proceeding on the basis that the Government’s political fortunes would change overnight. This is going to  be a long, hard race, and I’ve made that point before- and I know it’s a clichÃ©- but in the end, there’s only one  poll that counts. I’ve always believed this Parliament would go its full term, to September, October, November 

 of next year, and the closer we get to that poll the more people will stop looking at the Government in  isolation and start to make judgements about Tony Abbott. And what Mr Abbott has said, so far as carbon  pricing is concerned, really does call into question his judgment.

 The world didn’t end on 1 July. There is too much carbon in our environment and too much carbon in our  economy and we have to reduce that and that’s what the carbon pricing arrangements are all about. And there  is adequate compensation, whether it’s for pensioners, self-funded retirees or business and industry to  compensate for any price increases and Greg Combet’s been making that point crystal clear in recent days. So,  we know that when you introduce big and substantial economic and social change, there’s always political  controversy, there’s always political difficulty. We’re going through that period but in the run-up to between  now and the next election the community will make a judgment about the sense of that long term economic  change and Mr Abbott’s judgment.

 JOURNALIST:  Have you been shocked by the findings of the DLA Piper review?

 STEPHEN SMITH:       As I’ve made the point previously, in the aftermath of the ADFA Skype issue, my office  and Defence and the media were inundated with past allegations of previous abuse and the allegations that  DLA Piper have considered go back as early as 1951. So, we’re dealing now with what are described as over  700 plausible cases over a five or six decade period and that’s why we’ve got to work through them very  carefully and very clearly. But they do raise very serious allegations, and they do raise matters which are  deeply sensitive. And they will shock some people- and that’s why we’ve been dealing, not just myself and DLA  Piper, but also in more recent times the Attorney-General, dealing with these matters very thoughtfully as we  work through the best judgements we can make dealing, as we are, with firstly over 700 so-called plausible  allegations over a five or six-decade period, and then trying to deal with what this says systemically about  Defence and how we should respond to that.

 JOURNALIST:  And just to clarify, what will happen after the [indistinct]

 STEPHEN SMITH:     Sorry?

 JOURNALIST:  [indistinct]

 STEPHEN SMITH:       Well as I say, the Government’s not too far away from making final conclusions or  decisions in this area so we expect, in the near future, to be able to make an announcement about how we are  proposing to proceed from here. And the review itself - DLA Piper’s recommendations itself canvas all of the  possibilities. These include an apology to people who have been adversely affected by abuse, relying upon  existing processes or procedures, including criminal processes and procedures, the introduction of a capped  compensation scheme, but also further legal or judicial inquiry including a Royal Commission. So, we’re  working our way carefully through those options.

 JOURNALIST:  Minister, what do you make of Tony Abbott formally declining an invitation to be a part of the  asylum seeker committee?

 STEPHEN SMITH:       Well look, I very strongly believe - very strongly believe that in the last few days we  have seen, on the issue of people smuggling and asylum seekers and boats, a series of judgements by Tony  Abbott and a series of comments by Tony Abbott which really very much call into question his fitness for office  and his judgement. Firstly, he has been saying in Australia for some time that he will introduce a policy of  towing boats back to Indonesia. We now know, as a result of what Mr Abbott said over the weekend and what  the Indonesian officials have said, that he did not raise that with the President of Indonesia. He had a formal  meeting with the President of Indonesia, he passed up the opportunity of looking the Indonesian President in  the eye and saying Mr President, I will introduce a policy of turning boats back to Indonesia.

 So, so much for Tony Abbott saying to people that he is straight forward and up front. Nothing could have  been more disingenuous than not looking the Indonesian President in the eye and saying I will tow back the  boats to your country. That’s the first point. Secondly, we know from previous experience that towing back the  boats will not work in this era. In 2001-2003 we saw a small number of boats towed back. Since then,  circumstances have changed, and all you need to do is to look at the evidence given by the current Chief of  Navy at Senate Estimates- who was personally involved in the towing of boats back in 2001. And the evidence  he gave the Senate Estimates - he said he was involved both in a successful towing back and an unsuccessful 

 towing back, because what we now know is that boats are disabled, and you effectively turn immediately into  a rescue at sea operation.

 Thirdly, we have Tony Abbott himself, for the first time, saying over the weekend and yesterday that his  policy, his deliberate policy, a policy that he has thought through, a policy that he has attached himself to for  weeks and months, openly acknowledging that that policy will put Australian Defence Force personnel at risk.  He will put their lives in danger. He openly acknowledged that.  So, we firstly have Tony Abbott refusing to  look the Indonesian President in the eye and saying, I will tow boats back to Indonesia. We have Tony Abbott  refusing to take the sensible advice, whether it’s the current Chief of Navy or the former Chief of the Defence  Force, Admiral Barrie, that this is an impractical policy which can’t and won’t work. Thirdly, we have Tony  Abbott saying, I acknowledge that this will put the lives of Australian Defence Force personnel at risk. And  finally, we have Tony Abbott refusing to provide members of his own party to play a liaison role with the  committee - the expert committee chaired by the former Chief of the Defence Force, Angus Houston, who  himself knows a bit about asylum seeker and people smuggling and boat issues. All of these issues call into  question Tony Abbott’s judgement, his fitness for office, and his capacity to occupy the office of Prime Minister  of this country.

 JOURNALIST:  Do you think the Greens have too much power in the Federal Parliament; that they’re a bit  loopy? You know, that’s the kind of comments some of your colleagues are coming up with.

 STEPHEN SMITH:       Well, the Greens are their own political party. They are not an activist movement,  they’re a political party. They run for office. They’ve got one member in the House of Reps, and because no  major political party formed a majority in its own right, the Greens and the Independents help us form a  minority government. In the Senate they have considerable numbers. I think the Australian community  understand that the Greens are a political party. They have their own policies, they have their own approach to  matters and in very many fundamental respects they differ very much from the Labor Party. They’re entitled to  go out and put their policies to the Australian people just as the Liberal Party is and just as Labor is. And in  terms of allocation of preferences, these matters are always done by the party administration in the run up - the immediate run up to the election. But I think it’s becoming more apparent each day that the Greens are a  political party, like Labor and like the Liberals and the Nationals. They’re not an activist or a political  movement and some of their policies we strongly disagree with.  For example, in my area, in Jason’s area, the  Greens are very strongly opposed to the alliance with the United States which has been the bedrock of our  security and defence arrangements for over 60 years.

 JOURNALIST:  You’re up here for a Community Cabinet this afternoon, is that right?

 STEPHEN SMITH:       Yes.

 JOURNALIST:  Are you looking forward to that?

 STEPHEN SMITH:       Absolutely. Yeah, I’m heading off to the Community Cabinet which is up Ipswich way,  and between now and then I’m heading off to Enoggera to have a chat to our Defence Force personnel at the  barracks there. And before I go to the Community Cabinet I’ll drop into Amberley and see some of the Air  Force personnel there.

 JOURNALIST:  Quick question for Minister Clare if that’s okay?

 JASON CLARE:            Sure.

 JOURNALIST:  Why did we even bother to invite the Opposition to this [indistinct]…?

 JASON CLARE:            Well, I think the people of Australia expected Tony Abbott for once to say yes. The  people of Australia have had a gutful of this. They’re sick of politicians fighting; they’re sick of politicians  yelling at each other. They expect politicians to sit down together and work this issue through. This is a  reference panel to advise and support Angus Houston, the former Chief of the Defence Force, and Tony Abbott  has refused to even sit on that reference panel. And I think that the people of Australia will view that very  poorly. Two weeks ago the Liberal Party and the Greens voted together to stop offshore processing and now  the Liberal Party refuses to even sit on a panel to advise the expert group led by Angus Houston.  

 Can I also just use the opportunity here just to make a few other points about this idea of towing back boats.  What Mr Abbott is doing here is effectively playing Russian roulette with the lives of Australian sailors. He has  admitted this is dangerous, the former Chief of the Defence Force has said this is dangerous, the Chief of the  Navy has said this is dangerous, and we’ve had members of the Australian Navy saying this is dangerous. Just  in January you had a senior Naval officer say this about towing back boats: “they’ll disable their boats when  they see us coming; they will burn their boats. The policy will encourage them to do so and it will place lives - Navy lives, refugee lives - at risk.” And this is the crux of it. This is the crux of it, because if you try and tow a  boat back, the boat will be sabotaged, the boat will start to sink, people will jump into the water and Australian

 Navy personnel will have to go in and save them. That’s what puts their lives at risk, and that’s why this  Government is opposed to it. We won’t have it and nor should the Australian people.

 STEPHEN SMITH:       Okay. Thanks very much everyone. Cheers.
