 Advancing the National Interest: Australia’s Foreign Policy Challenges

 Canberra, 7 May 2002 (Check Against Delivery)

 2.

 Speech by the Hon Alexander Downer, MP, Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the Government’s Foreign and Trade Policy, at the National Press Club, Canberra, 7 May 2002.

 Introduction

 Ladies and Gentlemen

 There has never been a time when Australia’s foreign policy was a more vital ingredient in forging our nation’s future or a more crucial factor in how we view ourselves.

 Today, Australian foreign policy must operate in a very unpredictable world, therefore now more than ever it must be a very Australian foreign policy.

 We are a nation respected for our strength, our pragmatism, our responsibility and our generosity…and I believe most Australians and certainly our neighbours respect our views, our actions and our sincerity.

 We have to respect and build on our past allegiances and relationships…we have to work with our friends of the past…large and small, powerful and needy….but we also have to protect our own interests, which means forging new relationships and developing coalitions of mutual interest.

 Our economic security…our border security…and our ability to help shape a more secure world…all rely on Australia exercising a strong, independent, responsive and pragmatic foreign policy.

 Over the past six years the Australian Government has dealt with enormous challenges...from a watershed moment in East Timor to the shocking and unexpected horror of September 11th  -that has forced us all to re-evaluate the way we think about security, international relations and defence.

 Today I will talk briefly about Australia’s achievements and then focus on the primary drivers of change and the challenges ahead.

 The Government’s achievements

 Five years ago I commissioned the first ever White Paper on Australia’s foreign and trade policy.

 That paper -  In the National Interest - was a landmark document…. a blueprint for the conduct of Australian foreign and trade policy.

 The document has served us well, but the world has changed markedly since then.  It is therefore appropriate that we begin work on a fresh White Paper that builds on the original blueprint.

 The new paper, which will be called Advancing the National Interest, will assess the Government’s achievements.

 3.

 And it will set out the new challenges ahead.

 As we identified in 1997, at the core of our foreign and trade policy are the goals of promoting Australia’s economic prosperity, national security and our values.

 The Government has ensured that Australia’s national interest is advanced in an ambitious yet pragmatic and clear-minded fashion.  Because if we don’t…no one else will.

 To borrow the words of English realist Martin Wight,  ‘A foreign minister is chosen and paid to look after the interests of his country, and not to delegate for the human race.’

 We are not about trumpeting our own international good citizenry simply for the sake of it. That is a trap for the ideologues and the naÃ¯ve.  We are about good international citizenry where it can be shown to deliver tangible results for our interests and those of other people.

 The big lie perpetrated by some about our Government is that somehow we have not paid enough attention to the Asia Pacific region.

 The fact is that since 1997 we have sought to restore some of the balance in our foreign policy and to get away from an Asia-only focus to an Asia-first focus.  We have achieved this objective without any erosion of our core interests in our region.

 There is no doubt that Asia and the Pacific remain the primary focus of our foreign policy.

 Let me highlight a few examples of the Government’s achievements, starting on the economic and trade front:

 â¢ our domestic economy has grown at an average of 3.8%, and is currently one of the strongest in the world - interest rates are at their lowest level in 30 years

 â¢ Growth has been assisted by a 54% jump in the value of Australia’s total exports.  Our export success has been broadly-based, with a 45% rise in merchandise exports to East Asia (to $65 b), exports to the Middle East doubling (to $6.8 b), and up 111% to the US ($11.7 b)

 â¢ 1 in 5 Australian jobs now depend on our exports - illustrating the vested interests all Australians have in our international economic relations.

 We have ensured that the mandate for a new round of multilateral trade negotiations serves our interests, and that the WTO dispute settlement system delivers wins for our farmers on beef and lamb exports.

 We are now on paths to Free Trade Agreements with Singapore and Thailand and the United States.  Prime Minister Howard and his Japanese counterpart, Mr Koizumi, agreed last week to strengthen our economic and trade relations, including the long term prospect of an FTA.

 We are pursuing closer trade and investment links with ASEAN through the AFTA-CER Closer Economic Partnership. And our proposals for formal economic agreements have won interest in both Beijing and Seoul.

 4.

 On the security front, the Government has expanded the range of opportunities for Australia to engage key regional players on matters affecting the region’s security.   Formal political-military dialogues have been established with Japan, Korea, China and India.  And we are forging a new trilateral dialogue with Japan and the United States on regional security issues.

 We have consolidated our security alliance with the United States and, following September 11, invoked ANZUS for the first time since ANZUS was created.  Together, the web of US security alliances in the region are the linchpin for regional security and prosperity.

 And Australia is a founding member of a number of new regional structures designed to address new realities - the trilateral dialogue with Indonesia and East Timor, the Indian Ocean Rim Association Regional Cooperation forum, the Forum of East Asia - Latin American Co-operation, and the South-West Pacific Dialogue, which should have its inaugural meeting later this year.  We have continued to advance our security and economic interests through the ARF and APEC.

 While advancing Australia’s national interest we have also actively promoted core Australian values such as democracy and respect for human rights.  By establishing human rights dialogues with China and Vietnam and conducting workshops in Burma, the Government has created important opportunities to engage these countries constructively on issues of importance to the world community.

 Today I would like to announce that Australia will deliver a further two human rights workshops in Burma in July, again targeting middle-level public officials and civil society representatives.  In a further step to promote human rights in Burma, Australia will also support the participation of two Burmese judges at a regional judicial reform course, to be held in Sydney next month.

 We have used our aid program over the years to encourage good governance…promoting democracy, respect for the individual and equality before the law.  This heightened focus has seen Australia spending on governance programs in the Asia Pacific region more than double since 1998 to $291 mn in 2001.

 These are some of the tangible benefits of our pragmatic groundwork as opposed to substance-free grandstanding…it is our way of helping the region.

 We intend to pursue the same approach as a newly-elected member on the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.  In particular, to continue our push to reform UN human rights machinery so practical advances can be made to make them more credible.

 Nowhere have Australian values been better demonstrated than through our contributions to peace and stability and the promotion of democracy in the region - in East Timor, Fiji, the Townsville Peace Agreement for the Solomon Islands and in Bougainville (where, over nine years, more people were killed than in three decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland)

 Our efforts in the South Pacific have significantly enhanced the profile of Australia in the South Pacific.

 Globally, we are a full participant in the war against terrorism, providing political will, logistical support and troops on the ground.

 5.

 We are also contributing to regional efforts to counter the spread of international terrorist networks.

 We are committed to using all the resources at our disposal - military, intelligence, law enforcement, and customs - to address this most insidious threat to security.

 And finally, let me deal with another misconception - that Australia’s image abroad has been eroded because of our pursuit of a strong Australian economy, secure borders and focused interests.

 Australia’s standing abroad is in excellent shape.  This is reflected by some key facts:

 â¢ in 2001 our educational institutions hosted 68,000 students from South-East Asia, an increase of 26% from just six years ago;

 â¢ Since 1996 Australia has attracted some $74 bn in foreign direct investment, compared to $46 bn in the period 1990-1995;

 â¢ We remain a highly sought after destination for immigrants from all corners of the globe;

 â¢ Australia remains one of the world’s most attractive tourist destinations, reaffirmed before a global audience through the successful 2000 Olympic Games;

 â¢ We have successfully seen off the Hanson / One Nation movement and its racist undertones…you only have to look at the current climate in Europe, where several countries are grappling with the anti-immigration and anti-globalisation backlash, to appreciate the significance of our achievements.

 I have not sought to be exhaustive.  We are pleased with what we have achieved, but we cannot afford to be complacent. And, as a country, we must remain ambitious.

 The Changes

 We must remain focused on a rapidly changing world, and the impact of those changes on our interests.  And in recent times change has been simply enormous.

 No-one could have predicted at the time of the original White Paper the extent of change in our foreign and trade policy environment…the East Asian financial crisis, the aftermath of continued economic and political uncertainty and transition in many countries…Indonesia is still undergoing a historic transition to democracy and decentralised rule.  East Timor is on the threshold of independence.

 And our South Pacific neighbours are grappling with an array of economic, governance and security issues.

 The events of September 11 showed graphically the nature of new and emerging threats to sovereignty and international order.  They also represented an attack on the lifestyle and democratic values of all Australians and of all peace loving people.

 6.

 September 11 has jolted the established international order, and has led to a significant reassessment of the international agenda and shifts in traditional alignments.

 There has been a marked improvement, for example, in US relations with Russia and China.

 Inevitably, there will be more far-reaching consequences.  Much will hinge on the role of the United States and events post-Afghanistan.

 Conflict in the Middle East continues to have an impact beyond its borders.  Developments there will have a profound impact upon regional and global security.

 We cannot ignore the rapid advances in science and technology, both in their commercial and military applications.  We are still at the early stages of a revolution in military affairs, in information technology, in biotechnology, material science and nano-technology.

 No analysis of the changing world can ignore the pre-eminence of the United States.

 â¢ In 1980, the US accounted for 25% of the world economy and authors such as Paul Kennedy wrote of the imminent decline of what was described as the US empire.  Yet in 2001 the US economy accounted for 34%, or more than a third, of world GDP.

 â¢ US military expenditure is nearly US$400 bn, over six times that of the next largest, Russia, at US$60 bn and nearly ten times that of China, at US$42 bn.

 â¢ In research and development, the US is equally dominant.  In absolute terms, the US spent US$265 bn on R&D in 2000, a sum larger than the total R&D expenditure of Japan, Germany, the UK and France combined.

 We should draw confidence from the fact that Australia, under this Government, is well placed to meet the challenges of rapid and profound change.  We have enormous assets - tangible and otherwise - in our physical and intellectual resources, our political institutions, our defence capabilities, our dynamic, strong economy and our innovative and tolerant society.

 The Challenges

 Out of these changes emerge at least eight key challenges Australia has to face.  This is not an exclusive list, as I could include many more.

 Clearly the war against terrorism represents a pivotal challenge.  Our effort must be local, regional and global.  It must be sustained.  But it must also be mature.  We must guard against this war becoming something that it fundamentally is not - a clash between Islamic and Western civilisations.

 We must work with moderate Islamic leaders, particularly in our region, to defeat those who seek to extinguish human freedoms and are prepared to use horrific means to bring about their dark ends.

 Secondly, we have to face the challenges of our region.

 We must not fool ourselves that terrorism has somehow erased the other daunting concerns in our region.  The Asia-Pacific region is home to the world’s six largest armies (China, the US,

 7.

 Russia, India, North Korea and South Korea) and, after the Middle East, the world’s three most volatile flashpoints - the Taiwan Strait, the Korean Peninsula and Kashmir.  Australia will need to use its influence, as part of broader international efforts, to help ease tensions in these places.

 Australia must keep developing its relations in Asia, where we have abiding economic, security and other interests.  These interests reach across both the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and from New Zealand to India, to North Asia.  Japan, Korea and China remain vitally important, as do the emerging giant of India and the recovering region of South East Asia. Our efforts to maximise the benefits of all these relationships will include developing people-to-people links, exploiting our advantages in education and training and nurturing our own cultural diversity.

 We must continue to place a great deal of emphasis on Indonesia and work with the Indonesians as they embrace democracy and seek a more decentralised power structure. Recent times have witnessed historic meetings between our leaders, including the first State visit by an Indonesian President to Australia in over 25 years, and Prime Minister Howard was the first foreign leader to visit President Megawati.  We must maintain high-level exchanges, including between our Parliaments.

 China’s rising economic, political and strategic weight is the most important long-term trend in the region.  Its entry to the WTO and support for the US anti-terrorism coalition are positive indications of China’s maturing role as a regional and global power.  And despite its economic difficulties, Japan remains the world’s second largest economy and our largest trading partner. It will remain a critical player regionally and globally.

 In pursuing relations with Asia, we must continue to find the right balance and interplay between Australia’s engagement with Asia and our broader international relations. This is not about choosing between regions…it is about maximising our strengths.

 Indeed, we have shaped our foreign policy so that the various strands are mutually reinforcing. Just as our strong relationships outside the Asia-Pacific enhance our standing in the region, so do our strong regional links improve our international standing.

 Thirdly, we need to solve our recurring trade problems, including with the world’s largest economy: the United States.

 Our relationship with the United States is vital.  But we must work to match the strong security relationship with a much better economic relationship.  Too often, American decision-makers harm our trade.

 That is why we are seeking to put the economic relationship on a more strategic footing through our proposal for a Free Trade Agreement.

 We have to build upon the mosaic of economic agreements we are developing in order to maximise opportunities and eliminate barriers.  We must also protect and enhance our interests in the Doha Round of global trade negotiations.

 An important element in the new White Paper will be the need for Australia to develop functional affinities with countries and groups of countries where we share specific interests. The vital work of the Cairns Group, which includes many Latin American countries, in defending and taking forward Australia’s agricultural trade policy interests is a good example.

 8.

 Fourthly, we cannot afford to under-estimate the problems of the South Pacific.  Helping the countries of the South Pacific to ensure that they are viable, and sustainable, will remain a considerable challenge for Australia.  The prognosis for Papua New Guinea is better, but still worrying.

 Our development assistance program, and our emphasis on governance and reducing poverty in the region, will continue to play an important role.  And our partnership in the region with New Zealand will remain crucial.

 Fifthly, we need to understand better the emerging significance of the European Union.  Not only has much of Europe been transformed into a single market, with a common currency, but we are now seeing an emerging single voice on foreign, defence and security policy.

 We need to work hard on building our links not only with the individual member states of the European Union, but also with European institutions.  We need to see Europe through a new prism, not just through the United Kingdom and traditional bilateral relationships.

 We need to encourage greater trade flows, and remove market distortions.  I think that in this context, it is disturbing that high income countries, including those in the EU, spend nearly $1.8 bn per day  on agricultural support and protection - a sum seven times greater than the amount they provide in development assistance, and twice the value of agricultural exports from all developing countries.

 Sixthly, we must address the continuing emergence of trans-national issues such as people smuggling, money laundering, drug smuggling, access to clean water, environmental problems, the security of reliable energy sources, and prevention of diseases such as HIV/AIDS - they pose new threats to sovereignty and security, including in our region.

 Some of the statistics bear this out very graphically:

 â¢ Already, a number of countries in our region are suffering serious water shortages. Some estimates suggest that by 2025 as much as two-thirds of the world’s population could be facing water scarcity.

 â¢ The United Nations High Commission for Refugees estimates that there are 21.3 million refugees and displaced people.  When you add undocumented labour figures, the figure may be closer to 100 million.

 â¢ The International Organisation of Migration estimates that 4 million people are being trafficked across international borders every year, earning people smugglers around $15 billion a year.

 â¢ According to the UN Drug Control Program, the annual drug trade is worth between US$400 bn to US$500 bn, a sum larger than the combined GDPs of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.

 â¢ In June 2001, it was estimated that 7.5 million people in the Asia Pacific region had AIDS or were HIV positive.

 9.

 I mention these statistics because these problems demand effective, sometimes new, solutions. Australia is, for example, already playing a lead role, having facilitated regional conferences on HIV/AIDs and people smuggling.

 Seventh, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction - chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear - as well as missile proliferation is a growing problem - and a frightening one.

 The United Nations is a critical arena for dealing with such problems.  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, in which we played such an important part, is one such example.

 But the multilateral system is not a cure all.  Sometimes it can lead to lowest common denominator outcomes or outcomes that are simply not in our interests.

 We have to be tough and insist on raising the bar to meet our objectives and defend our interests where they are under threat.  So it was that we raised the bar for the Ottawa Landmines Convention.  And so it is that we will continue to seek the participation of developing countries in global action to address climate change.

 Finally, a challenge not always seen as synonymous with foreign or trade policy but one that is essential to the work of my Department - consular assistance.  It is an issue to which I have personally devoted great attention, because Australians make over 3.3 million trips overseas each year and believe me - they are capable of getting into all sorts of strife!

 While certain cases grab the headlines, each day Australian consular officials provide a helping hand to facilitate the travel and well being of tens of thousands of Australians abroad.  We have a clear responsibility as a Government to assist - to the extent that we can - Australians in trouble.  While I believe we have developed a very capable and modern consular service for Australians, the demands on that service will continue to increase at a rapid rate as we continue to travel and engage with countries across the globe.

 Conclusion

 Let me return to where I began.

 What the original White Paper sought to do, and what this new Paper will do, is to set the course for ensuring the security of the Australian nation  - the security of our economy, our jobs, our standard of living and our way of life.

 It is from our secure base that we seek to make a valuable contribution to improving the lot of all peoples around the world.

 The Government has a responsibility for the national interest and to fight for the interest of all Australians.  But we also have to be responsive to the values and ethics of the Australian people.

 These are the twin pillars - responsibility and responsiveness - upon which I base Australian foreign policy, and which will be the thread common to both White Papers.

 We must remain ambitious.  We must continue to develop a positive and confident future for Australia in a world of change.

 CHAIR: [applause]. And thank you Minister. As usual we move onto question time and the first one today is from Geoff Barker.

 QUESTION: Geoff Barker Australian Financial Review Minister. As a new - and as you stressed today - pragmatic member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, what is Australia doing to protect the legal rights of the two Australians currently being held by the US in Cuba over alleged collaboration with al-Qaeda. Specifically, when will we learn what Australian or other laws they have broken, if any, what charges they will face, if any, where and by whom they will be prosecuted, if at all, and why has Australia apparently acquiesced a US denial or normal consular access to these people?

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well let me make two quick points about that. The first is we're not a member yet of the UN Commission. We've been elected to it but our term doesn't start till next year so that particular context isn't relevant.

 Let me say this about these two Australians who are now in Guantanamo Bay. Australian officials will be visiting, certainly one of them, very soon and we have asked the United States administration for access also to Mr Habib. So Mr Hicks will be visited but Mr Habib, we hope, our officials will be able to visit as well and obviously we would like that visit to take place and those discussions to take place at the same time as the visit to David Hicks.

 The second thing I would say about is though, look, Australians who get involved in organisations like al-Qaeda, who have committed the most egregious act of terror since the second world war are people who, to put it kindly, are very, very foolish. And we have very deep concern about any people who are involved with al-Qaeda. This is an extraordinarily bad organisation. This is a wicked organisation.

 And where Australians have become involved with an organisation which the United States rightly perceives as being a direct threat to the security of the American people and we see as being a direct threat to the security of our people, and peoples around the world, then inevitably tough action has to be taken.

 In the end the questions of prosecution and the like will be resolved but I think sometimes critics of the United States administration and us, over these people, underestimate the strength of feeling and the concern there is in our communities about the evil of al-Qaeda and their terrorist activities.

 QUESTION: Minister, just on the same topic, last year the Government, in a statement on December the 20th, mentioned three Australians who had been allegedly involved with al-Qaeda and, at that time, you also knew that Mumdu [phonetic] Habib had been allegedly involved. Why didn't you mention him on that list at that particular time? His lawyer, for example, suggests you were trying to fob him off to the Egyptians. So I'd like to see what you have to say on that.

 The second is that, on the topic of the Middle East, Arab ambassadors to Australia suggest that the Howard Government has been soft on Israel - too soft on Israel - they were supposed to meet Prime Minister Howard last Friday. What do you say to the charge …

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well they did meet him.

 QUESTION: What do you say to the allegation Australia has been too soft on Israel's policy on the West Bank?

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well first of all, believe me, there's no conspiracy in relation to Australians who might've been involved in al-Qaeda and no doubt these lawyers will go out and try to get a bit of media coverage for themselves, making all sorts of allegations.

 I'd have to look at the exact wording of the transcripts to remind myself precisely what Daryl Williams and I said. But the point that we've made on several occasions is that there have been a small number of Australians believed to have been involved in al-Qaeda.

 In the case of Mr Habib, I can't remember the exact dates off the top of my head, but I do recall that he was picked up on the, I think, Afghanistan/Pakistan border. And he was taken to Egypt and we tried to obtain confirmation of his whereabouts, including from the Egyptian authorities, and we were unable to do that for a long period of time.

 The next we heard he was in Afghanistan so more has been established since then, we understand more about him now than we did at that time.

 In relation to the others, well, I don't think I need to elaborate on what you already know. And, you know, finally, I think the important point here is what I've said about Australians who get involved in organisations like al-Qaeda. Yes, they have their rights and yes, so do the peoples of the world who are subject to threats by organisations like al-Qaeda. So does my heart go out the families of those who died on September the 11th, including the Australian families, just a shocking thing to have done. And people who muck about with organisations like al-Qaeda are bound to get themselves into a great deal of trouble.

 As far as the Middle East is concerned, I can only say, well look, people make all sorts of claims I guess about the Australian Government. I've been the Minister for Foreign Affairs for six years now so some of those claims, I can say, only read with wry amusement.

 We very much hope that it's now going to be possible to progress towards a peace settlement in the Middle East. In the end there will be not just a secure and strong Israeli State but there will be a Palestinian State and there will be negotiations about precisely where the borders should go and terms of a peace settlement.

 But I'm optimistic that, in the fullness of time, that a satisfactory conclusion will be reached. Now does our broad position there demonstrate any bias? Well it depends how you look at it. I guess some of the Palestinians would claim we were biased to the Israelis and some Israelis would say we were biased towards the Palestinians.

 I mean, to be honest with you, we just try to do what we should do and that is not play political games but call the situation as we see it. Sometimes we agree with the facts as they're presented in the media but you can rest assured that sometimes we don't. And where we don't we're quite happy to say we don't. That might not always make us popular but we just live with that.

 But anyway, we're not endeavouring to be biased, we're endeavouring to make a small contribution to a peaceful settlement in the Middle East and we very much hope that we're seeing the beginnings of that process taking place now. And I hope, in particular, that the visit by Prime Minister Sharon to Washington will be a successful and fruitful visit.

 QUESTION: Minister, Geoff Parry [phonetic] from Seven Network. A quick one on Mr Habib. David Hicks was captured inside Afghanistan. Mr Habib was arrested inside Pakistan. In relation to him, does the presumption of innocence not apply, in respect of Mr Habib? And secondly, you would be aware that there's a two day summit in Sydney on refugees. My question is do you get weary …

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: It's on population I think.

 QUESTION: I'm sorry, on population and immigration…

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: But there may be one on refugees but I'm not aware of it. I think you mean population.

 QUESTION: My question is do you get weary of defending Australia's reputation overseas in respect of its refugee policy?

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well I think I've sort of said all I can say about Mr Habib and Mr Hicks and so on.

 Well there are people, I think, very prominent, in the Australian media and in some sections of what I would call the pseudo-intellectual bourgeois left who criticise the Australian Government on these issues. [laughter]. But I always say to the pseudo-intellectual bourgeois left, you know, you are pseudo-intellectuals so you never let the facts get in the way of a good story.

 You would think, as the Foreign Minister of Australia, I'd have a bit of a sense of what the world thinks of Australia on these issues. But if you are part of that - you know, not you personally, cos you wouldn't be - but if one is - well I'm definitely not accusing you of that - but um such as base accusation against anybody in the Canberra Press Gallery would be unacceptable. [laughter]

 But, you know, people who say this is bad for Australia's reputation and all that sort of thing seem to be basing their argument, as best I can make out, on, you know, a negative editorial in The Guardian in London and, you know, gee whiz, The Guardian criticises us. That really would knock your socks off that some leftist British newspaper would criticise you. So what? And, you know, The New York Times or someone.

 This doesn't constitute international condemnation, just a few journos in a few foreign newspapers picking up on wire reports out of Australia. My dealings with governments around the world, I would say they are overwhelmingly concerned about the issue of illegal people movements, particularly western governments but not just western governments, and I think there is enormous determination - and it's a growing determination - to stamp out people smuggling.

 And people look at what Australia has done which is a function, you know, there are things we can do that others can't do - Australia is an island continent - other countries don't have that profile so they have to use different measures to deal with these problems.

 But as you know, whether you go to the European Union or North America or wherever it is, people are wrestling with this issue. I find, frankly, they're more interested in how we're wrestling with it and whether we're being successful or not - which we are - than critical.

 I was in Brussels two weeks ago or three weeks ago - time moves so quickly when you're enjoying yourself - but two or three weeks ago, and we had a long discussion with the European Commission, with Chris Patten and other commissioners about this issue. I met with the Belgian Foreign Minister while I was there as well, who's a very strong advocate of human rights and renowned in Europe for his strength of advocacy on these issues. I don't think the Belgian Foreign Ministry even mentioned the issue from memory. But the European Commission are really interested in what we're doing and looking to develop cooperation with Australia.

 In the region, no. I mean we had a regional conference on people smuggling and our critics never refer to this. I mean they deliberately don't refer to this. We had around 36 countries, 37, 38 ministers, represented at this conference - ministers from all around the Asia/Pacific region. There was complete consensus about the need to address this issue, that this issue has gone a long way up the chain of issues that need to be addressed.

 Has there ever been any criticism from any government anywhere in the world? Occasionally, but is it a big issue in terms of Australia's image, of course it's not. I think Australia internationally has never been better regarded for the strength of its economy, for what we did in East Timor, for our fortitude and determination and the decency of the Australian people.

 After all, we're one of those few countries in the world which has an active and non-discriminatory immigration program. And anybody who knows anything about Australia knows it's a country people can migrate to and there's no discrimination in our immigration program on the basis of ethnicity or race or religion or whatever it may be. It's just one of the great strengths of Australia and I think Australia's rightly a very highly regarded country around the world.

 QUESTION: Mark Forbes from The Age Minister. You nominate China's emergence as a major long-term issue. How do we manage that relationship, given potential tensions over supporting things such as exclusive regional security forums and our backing of US policies, including national missile defence?

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well I think overall our relationship with China is very strong. As you know the Prime Minister is about to go to China in the next couple of weeks and the exchange of high level visits in both directions is an illustration of how seriously both countries take each other.

 We're very committed to a strong relationship with China. One of the things we'd like to do with China is have a more all-embracing trade and economic agreement with China. And we've had preliminary discussions with Beijing about developing such an agreement and I think, if we were to do that, it'd be an important step forward in the bilateral relationship.

 We've been very successful, even though it's been criticised from here and there, in setting up a human rights dialogue with China and addressing some of the difficult issues in the relationship. We've been very successful in developing better political and security dialogues with China too, in recent times.

 Often security assessments coincide. We don't see China, as some would portray it, as a great threat to the region. I think the significant thing to say about China is that it is obviously the emerging major power of the region, with its high rate of growth and its vast population and land area. And China needs to be, on the one hand, accommodated as a central part of the region's architecture - be it economical or political security - but at the same time China itself needs to be sensitive to its growing weight in the region and ensure that it handles its relationships with other

 countries in an appropriate and a sensitive way. And I think, you know, there are obviously points of difficulty and difference here and there from time to time but I think, generally speaking, one would say that they're making quite a good fist of that.

 Since you ask about China, I take the opportunity to say I thought it was an extraordinary thing that Mr Crean, who thinks that China is part of ASEAN - he made that clear in his AM interview the day after he made his speech about China - China, Korean and Japan were part of ASEAN apparently. But in any case China is not part of ASEAN by the way.

 But I just make this point. He talked about the importance of the relationship with China and of course no-one would argue with that. But he didn't have the strength to explain there are obviously differences and difficulties in our relationship with China as well as great synergies and complimentarities. He didn't talk about what Labor would do with a human rights dialogue with China. Would Labor abolish the human rights dialogue? And what were the issues of a so-called sensitive human rights nature that Mr Crean raised with the Chinese leaders while he was in China? I mean he refused to comment except to say that they were private discussions. I think we have a right to know what issues he raised of that nature.

 I think, with China, it's important to have a comprehensive relationship, to understand of course the obvious positive and strong things we can do with China - and Mr Crean talked about some of those - and we're doing some of those already like looking at developing a new trade and economic agreement with China. But at the same time, you have to understand that there are points of difference and be prepared to talk about those points of difference and find ways of managing those points of difference. And I think his speech lacked the maturity to be able to do that.

 QUESTION: Bernard Friedman [phonetic] Australian Jewish News Minister. The Associated Press reports that Israel has evidence that millions of dollars given to the Palestinian Authority by the European Union and other States for humanitarian purposes have instead been used to pay Palestinian terrorists to buy arms and directly finance terrorist acts.

 Have you got any proof that some or all of the millions of dollars of taxpayers money Australia contributes to Palestinian bodies for humanitarian purposes haven't been diverted in the same way and, if not, will you check to find out?

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: I have no evidence that Australian money has been used in that way. I looked to officials to see whether any of them can ever recall hearing of such a thing, but they're all shaking their heads.

 We announced very recently that we'd provide an additional million dollars of humanitarian assistance to [break in tape] territories and that money was to be channelled through UNWA [phonetic] which is a United Nations agency, so I don't think there's any danger of it being diverted for those purposes. And secondly through the International Commission of the Red Cross and I'd be pretty confident in the International Commission of the Red Cross.

 Whether any money, any support, could've been stolen at any time I'm not familiar with that. I think it is, in our case, highly unlikely, we have extraordinarily tight systems of monitoring how every dollar of our aid budget is spent and I think it would not have happened.

 In the case of the European Union, I just can't say, this alleged, I can't really comment on it. It may or may not have happened, I just don't know.

 QUESTION: Karen Polgraves [phonetic] from AAP. Two issues that seem to be emerging in the world - particularly in our region - that will affect stability, are racism and religious conflict and I wonder if you could say how you see the White Paper perhaps addressing those issues.

 And I have to ask you a question about East Timor, I'm sorry. I'm sure you will agree that the exchange of information, and the public space for debate and information exchange is very important, particularly in an emerging democracy. And you may know that the public broadcasting corporation which has just been established by regulation in East Timor, however there is no money to fund it, and on May 20 we will witness the birth of a nation and the demise of the broadcaster. And I wonder if Australia might help out?

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: [laughs]. Well I'm not aware of that actually, I should be I s'pose. But I must say, voracious as my knowledge may be - comprehensive - or my appetite for knowledge, and comprehensive, I'm not aware that they would have to close a radio station or telecommunications station at the time of Independence. I'll have to have a look at that.

 I mean just imagine East Timor without the sort of ETBC of whatever it would be eventually called, or Australia without its ABC. That's your point I s'pose. So I'll just have to look into that, I don't know.

 Well I think racism's a bit of a capsule phrase. Often ethnic conflict can be bound up with a cultural intolerance, rather than necessarily something as simplistic as racism. I think, in the Asia/Pacific region, conflict between Islamic and non-Islamic communities is a very challenging issue to manage.

 It's obviously crucially important for a country like Australia that the Huntingdon Clash of Civilisations doesn't happen, given where we are and how we have to live in this part of the world. And we should do everything we can to try to encourage productive inter-communal relations around the region, and we do that in a number of different ways, including through our aid program.

 But I think this whole notion of how, particularly, non-Islamic countries manage Islam is crucially important. And I very much went out of my way in my speech to refer to this point, that the war against terrorism, the conflict in the Middle East, problems in Western China, problems in some parts of Indonesia such as Papua and so on, they shouldn't be interpreted as clashes of civilisation.

 And it's enormously important that western countries go out and argue the case that Islam is a great force for peace, it's a peaceful religion - a peace-loving religion - it's part of the broader tradition of religions which Christianity and Judaism belong as well. And it is very, very important that a country like ours promotes the whole notion of multiculturalism and the grand and global scale, not just multiculturalism here at home.

 QUESTION: Belinda Goldsmith from Reuters Minister. In outlining the direction of the new White Paper, you seem to put increased emphasis again on Australia's relationship with the United States, particularly in the wake of events of September the 11th.

 Is there any danger, do you think, that putting this increased priority on Australia's relationship with Washington could jeopardise Australia's relations with some of its Asian neighbours?

 And secondly, you mentioned the ongoing problems in South Pacific. Could you possibly give us an update on the Solomon Islands, the situation there?

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well, in the case of the United States, in our case we make no apology for our alliance relationship with the United States and the close political relationship we have with the administration in Washington. We're quite happy to fess up to that. We do have a close relationship with the United States and there are all sorts of historic, current, and geo-political reasons why that should be the case.

 In terms of the region, I've argued for all of my adult life that the engagement of the United States in the architecture of the Asia/Pacific region is fundamental to the stability of the region. The United States is the world's largest economy, an enormous source of innovation and technology. It's clearly crucially important we have a very strong engagement with the United States economically.

 We have a lot of trade conflicts with the United States, and have done over many years. And that is an issue that needs to be addressed systemically, not just on a case-by-case basis. And that's why we think the Free Trade Agreement with the United States could be such a very constructive step forward.

 I think other countries in the region, without exception, understand only too well the importance of the United States to the region. And when I had the Chinese Foreign Minister here - Foreign Minister Tung - a few weeks ago, we had a bit of a discussion about Australia's relationship with the United States and he made it perfectly clear that wasn't something China wanted to criticise. It's something China understood, they realised it was a historic and important part of Australia's international relationships.

 I mean, you know, I notice that Mr Crean the other day, in his famous speech, Mr Crean criticised Australia for being too close to the United States. That Australia should somehow differentiate itself in the Asia/Pacific region from the United States, just for the sake of it, just so we can say we've differentiated ourself from the United States, is a pitiful excuse for a foreign policy.

 Of course there are issues where we don't agree with the United States - a lot of trade issues -we've been a bit critical of the moratorium - or the suspension - of the engagement with North Korea but we're pleased they're now getting back to that. There are other points of difference we've had with them over the comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Biological Weapons Convention, additional protocol, yes, there are points of difference.

 But we don't make a virtue of the differences we have with the United States, we make a virtue of our national interest. And where the United States interests and our interests coincide, we unashamedly promote that coincidence of interests. Where they differ, we quite happily tell the Americans that our views differ and we sometimes argue about these things.

 But I think we get great value from our strong relationship with the United States and I think one of the differences between the Government and the Opposition is that the Opposition Leader has decided now to go down the path of trying to water down the relationship with the United States, weaken the relationship with the United States for the sake of appeasing the Left of the Labor Party and the anti-American pseudo-intellectual bourgeois leftist clique in Australia. And I grew out of all that when I left uni. [laughter]

 CHAIR: Do you want to talk about the Solomon Islands?

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Oh sorry, the Solomon Islands, I'm sorry.

 On the Solomon Islands - to be serious - on the Solomon Islands look, to be honest with you, I still remain very concerned about the situation there. Yes, I mentioned in my speech the Townsville Peace Agreement was the basis for ending intercommunal conflict. But the level of crime, the breakdown in law and order in the Solomon Islands is a very substantial problem still. The economy is doing very poorly, is in a terrible state, and we are continuing to engage as successfully and productively as we can with the Solomon Islands Government. I think Prime Minister Kemakesa is trying is hardest, he's a good man, and I think he's doing a good job.

 But to be frank with you, the challenge of getting law and order back under control in Solomon Islands, which is the first priority, is a big challenge. Our aid budget at the moment, our aid programs in Solomon Islands are overwhelmingly focused on law and order issues first and foremost, you know. Because you can't really construct the rest of the society without there being decent law and order in Solomon Islands.

 So, to be frank with you, there's still a long way to go.

 QUESTION: Ian McDonald [phonetic] from Dow Jones. There were some calls a few weeks back for East Timor to re-negotiate the arrangement on the Timor Gap and, since then, there've been a few conflicting comments from the East Timorese. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on how the process is going towards signing the final treaty which, I think, you had thought would be signed around Independence Day. And if there are any outstanding issues, could you just tell us what they are.

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well we hope to. I can't say we will because I don't know but we are still working very hard on resolving the outstanding issues and there'll be some meetings that'll take place during the latter part of this week on that issue. It's an important priority for us to try to reach an agreement before the 20th of May because that's when the current Timor Gap Treaty expires, when East Timor becomes independent.

 There are essentially two issues. One of them is the arrangement - fiscal arrangement - that was negotiated between East Timor and Phillips, which had some financial implications for Australia. And so, whilst they reached an agreement, we were left with the bill and we're now working through those issues with Phillips in particular and I'm optimistic those issues can be resolved. There's at least, as things currently stand, a good framework for reaching agreement with them.

 The other outstanding issue is this question of the unitisation of the Sunrise Troubador Field, which is a field that straddles the joint development area and the Australian territorial area. And there are some differences - which I won't bore you with - but there are some differences in terms of how that's to be managed. But we hope we can resolve those as well, I'm not too pessimistic about that. I mean you can't really tell in negotiations, from my experience, but there's a reasonable basis for reaching an agreement on that.

 So we're still working towards finalising our agreement on the 20th of May in East Timor but we'll have to wait and see how we get on. But I think things are looking reasonably positive.

 You're right, I mean there've been different messages that have come out from different people on different occasions, but anyway, the point is we're not getting into a public debate with anybody.

 QUESTION: Oh Minister, Graham Dobell from Radio Australia. On doing the hard issues with China, when the Dalai Lama came in '96 he saw both the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader. Indications we're getting now is that when he comes this time he will see neither of those leaders. Is that a sign of the rise and rise of China? And will you be seeing the Dalai Lama when he comes?

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: No it's a sign of the fact that I'll be in East Timor, and then in Thailand and then in Indonesia during that period and I didn't arrange the visits in order to avoid the Dalai Lama. That is just how it's turned out.

 And you're right though, both the Prime Minister and I have seen the Dalai Lama and I make the point to you that Mr Crean - certainly Mr Crean, I can't speak for Mr Rudd, who's the Opposition Spokesman on Foreign Affairs - but Mr Crean has not seen the Dalai Lama.

 So I will be interested to see, when Mr Crean gets back from East Timor on the 21st I suppose -the 20th or the 21st - of May, whether he will be able to squeeze in a meeting with the Dalai Lama between the 21st of May and the 27th of May. And I'd like to know whether he told the Chinese leadership, when he was in Beijing recently, that he was going to see the Dalai Lama. And if he wasn't going to see the Dalai Lama I'd like him to explain to the Australian people why he's not.

 But in the case of Mr Howard and I, we both have had the opportunity to meet the Dalai Lama and they were useful meetings. I'll be away and Mr Howard will be away for nearly all of the time as well, including ironically, but by complete coincidence, in China where he will, amongst other things, be pursuing the LNG [phonetic] that we hope to get - we don't really know whether we will or not - but we're certainly trying.

 QUESTION: Craig Spein from The Sydney Morning Herald. Is it not the case that, in the context of the War against Terrorism, governments in the coalition led by the United States have been going soft on repressive governments in Central Asia and elsewhere. And I ask specifically, why is it the Australian Government has gone very quiet on the use of the ISA in Malaysia to imprison mainstream political dissidents, including Tian Chua [phonetic] who's been in jail for more than a year, and what is your view of both those points - the fact that we seem to be going soft at the moment and the specifics of their imprisonment.

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well whatever we say to the Malaysian Government privately - I don't want to sound as though I'm trying to hide something here, I'll tell you my point - we really have got past the point where we're going to get into slanging matches with the Prime Minister of Malaysia.

 There's been Australian Government after Australian Government - including our Government on one or two occasions - who've got into unfruitful, fruitless, exchanges with Dr Mahathir and we're just not intending to go down that path.

 In terms of Central Asia, I think you'd appreciate that we don't have extensive relationships with the countries of Central Asia if you mean, for example, countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan and so on. And so, at one stage we had an embassy in al Mahdi in Kazakhstan, we

 don't any longer have an embassy there. So we don't have very extensive dialogue with that part of the world.

 But as for other countries in the so-called Coalition against Terrorism, you'd have to put your question to them.

 QUESTION: Indistinct.

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well I have answered my question, whatever we say privately, I just don't think it's - I mean I'm being brutally frank with you - I make the judgement that I don't think it's terribly productive to get into a long and fruitless slanging match with the Malaysian Government. I mean Australian Governments have done that over the years and our job is to promote our national interests. I don't think that's in our national interest.

 QUESTION: Chris Hammer [phonetic] from SBS Television. You've reinforced again today the importance of the US alliance to Australian Foreign Policy. Yet there are areas where there are differences and, as recently as the last 24 hours, you've underlined - when it comes to Burma -that you feel that Australia's policy of engagement has been vindicated with the release of Aung San Suu Kyi.

 I noticed today these wire reports with the US more or less putting on notice three more countries, as well as the famous three Axis of Evil countries. I think Syria, Cuba and Libya, countries which I think we all, all of which we have diplomatic relations with. How does Australia treat these three countries, plus the original three countries, how do we differ in our approach to them? You've said how important the War on Terrorism is, to try and stop the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction. Where's the differentiation there, if any?

 ALEXANDER DOWNER: There are differences and there are similarities. First of all, to take up the negative, to take up the differences we have with the United States, we don't have a sanctions regime against Cuba, and I've never thought that was worthwhile. I don't think, in all the years it's been in place, it's proved to be a successful policy - there might be quite a lot people in the United States who would agree with me. And there might be a few people in a few strategic parts - electorally strategic parts - of the United States who don't.

 I wouldn't want to accuse the United States of letting domestic politics dictate its foreign policy. But, in any case, we also don't have a sanctions regime against Iran which the United States has, and that was introduced in the life of the former Australian Government. But neither the Keating Government nor our Government has seen that as being likely to be productive or successful so we haven't supported that.

 What points of common view do we have? We have points of common view about the development in a lot of those countries, of missile technology which is a threat to regional security. We have real concerns about the development of weapons of mass destruction capability.

 We have very substantial concerns about the proliferation of missile technology in particular but also potentially even worse technology than that by those countries or, in some cases, to those countries. If you include, for example, North Korea, the three countries in the so-called Axis of Evil as described by the United States. We don't use that language ourselves but that's the language that President Bush has used.

 And these are very serious - very serious - concerns. I would say this: I think Syria and Iran could make a much stronger contribution to peace in the Middle East - a much stronger contribution to peace in the Middle East - than they have been making in recent times, over the last few years, not over the last few weeks, over the last few years.

 We would like to see those countries become part of the peace process, part of the peace group, part of the peace campaign. And they haven't been, for a long time.

 So we have points of difference with these countries, there's no question of that. In the case if Iraq, you know, we have enormous concerns about the development of weapons of mass destruction capability in Iraq. I mean, after all, Saddam Hussein is a leader who has form. He's used chemical weapons against his own people. We obviously are deeply concerned that Iraq continues to refuse to allow inspections, it refuses to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions. And the United Nations, as well as the United States and its friends and allies around the world, are going to have to keep pressing - and pressing very forcefully and very strongly - for Iraq to comply with its full international obligations.

 So we have a lot of concerns with these countries but [indistinct] we handle the relationships with them, in some cases, a little differently from the United States.

 [applause].
