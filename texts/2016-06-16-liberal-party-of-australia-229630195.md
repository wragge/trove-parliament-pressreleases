 New ½gures reveal Coalition's jobactive programme delivering jobs to more Australians

 Employment figures released today reveal people looking for work under the

 Coalition’s new jobactive employment services model are achieving better, long-term employment outcomes.

 The Turnbull Coalition is committed to implementing effective policies to deliver

 jobs and growth. The 2015 reforms to the Government’s employment services

 programme clearly show the changes are providing significant benefits for

 people looking for a job, employers and the broader economy.

 Since the start of jobactive in July 2015, jobactive providers have recorded over

 321,000 placements into jobs across Australia. Of these, over 90,000 were for

 young job seekers under 25, over 26,000 were for Indigenous job seekers and

 over 11,000 were for refugees.

 Furthermore, a marked increase in the number of people staying in employment

 under jobactive compared to the previous Labor Government’s Job Services

 Australia model demonstrates that the Coalition is getting people into a job and

 keeping them in a job.

 The latest data on employment outcomes for people looking for a job under

 jobactive shows an 5.9 per cent increase in the number of paid employment

 outcomes for people who have remained in work for at least 12 weeks when

 compared to the first eleven months under Labor’s Job Services Australia.

 That means a greater number of people who have found work under jobactive

 are sticking with those jobs, compared to the old system. The Coalition’s reforms

 are delivering more Australians into work and keeping them there for longer -

 this is an outstanding result that is good for the individual, families, communities

 and the broader economy.

 Clearly, the greater focus under jobactive on helping employers find candidates

 who are the right fit, is delivering a real and lasting difference in the lives of

 thousands of previously unemployed Australians.

 The facts speak for themselves - our system is working in achieving sustainable,

 long-term outcomes for people wanting to move out of welfare and into

 employment.

 The Turnbull Coalition has committed $7.5 billion to the jobactive programme

 and is a key part of the Coalition’s employment strategy to reduce barriers to

 employment and promotingworkforce participation.

 Only the Turnbull Coalition has a carefully structured plan for jobs and growth.

 We are the only team implementing effective policies to drive the transition to the

 new economy, create gainful employment opportunities for all and secure a

 prosperous future for Australian families.
