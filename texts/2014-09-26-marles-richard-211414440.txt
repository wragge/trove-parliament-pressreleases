 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 MEDIA RELEASE   

 MORRISON’S $40 MILLION FARCE 

 

 

 Even the football finals can’t hide the fact that Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has  spent a staggering $40 million to sign a dud deal that will see only a handful of refugees  resettled in Cambodia.    

 It is no wonder Scott Morrison refused to answer questions during his five-minute late  afternoon signing of the agreement in Phnom Penh yesterday.    

 Before this agreement was even signed, the only information the Australian people received  was courtesy of the Cambodian press and the Cambodian Government.    

 It is no wonder the Abbott Government has refused to release details about this agreement.    

 It is a complete farce.     

 According to the Cambodian Government, the $40 million will mean:    

 “We will try to take four or five people, maybe two or three (initially).”    

                         Cambodian Minister of Interior, Sar Kheng - Phnom Penh Post, 26 September, 2014 

 

 This follows Scott Morrison’s self-confessed ‘landmark’ deal with India that was dead before  the ink was even dry.   

 Scott Morrison blocked Labor’s Malaysian deal, criticising it for ‘only providing for 800 people’  - instead Scott Morrison has spent $40 million on a dud deal that provides for only 5 people.
