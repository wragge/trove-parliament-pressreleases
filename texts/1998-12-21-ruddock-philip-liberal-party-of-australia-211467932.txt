  Ruddock asks for community input

  MPS 161/98 

  The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Rudd ock, 
today announced the release of a community discussion paper on the provision 
of material assistance to entrants under the Humanitarian Program. 

 The paper, which will 
be distributed to key groups working in the area, will look at whether 
the current program meets the needs of refugees when they settle in 
Australia. Areas to be looked at include accommodation on arrival, food 
and clothing, and assistance with establishing a household. 

 "I previously announced 
the establishment of the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy 
which aims to take a more holistic and targeted approach to the provision 
of settlement services," Mr Ruddock said. 

 "As part of the 
ongoing development of this Strategy I have initiated a review of the 
material assistance that is provided to refugees and humanitarian entrants 
to ensure that their specific needs are being met and that these services 
are being delivered in an efficient and effective manner. 

 "This Paper aims 
to stimulate discussion on these issues and the development of possible 
models for the future delivery of material assistance to refugees and 
humanitarian entrants. 

 "I invite all those 
involved in assisting refugees and other humanitarian entrants to settle 
in Australia - the families of refugees themselves, community organisations 
and government agencies, to participate in this discussion and to provide 
their views." 

 The Department of Immigration 
and Multicultural Affairs has engaged a consultant to actively seek 
out the views of stakeholders through a series of discussion groups 
to be held in all capital cities. 

 Copies of the Discussion 
Paper and details of the discussion groups are available from Humanitarian 
Settlement Officers in each DIMA State and Territory office. Contact 
details are shown below.
