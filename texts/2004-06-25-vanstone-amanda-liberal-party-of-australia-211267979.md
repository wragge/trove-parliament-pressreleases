 Migration Tribunal Reappointments

 VPS 90/2004

 Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, today  announced the reappointment of 59 members of the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and the Refugee  Review Tribunal (RRT).

 The reappointed members start their new terms on 1 July 2004. There will be 12 full-time, 43 part-time and  four senior members. 

 Full-time and part-time members serve three-year terms while senior members are appointed for two-and-a-half years.

 All the members have extensive migration tribunal experience. They come from a broad cross-section of the  community and have either worked in a profession or in senior levels of the private or public sectors. 

 The Minister said the members have contributed much to the tribunals and demonstrated their ability to make  sound judgements. 

 'Their reappointment will ensure that the tribunals keep benefiting from their wealth of knowledge and  experience, and will enable the tribunals to continue to provide sound merits review,' Minister Vanstone said.

 For the first time, all 43 part-time members will be cross-appointed to serve on both tribunals, enabling work  to be spread more efficiently between the bodies.

 The MRT provides independent merits review of general migration decisions and the RRT provides  independent merits review of protection visa decisions.

 The 50 members who have been reappointed to the MRT comprise 3 senior members, 4 full-time members  and 43 cross-appointed part-time members.

 The 52 members who have been reappointed to the RRT comprise 1 senior member, 8 full-time members and  43 cross-appointed part-time members.
