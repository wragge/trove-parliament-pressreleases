 Laurie Ferguson MP  Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services 

 

 SFifth-term announcements for Refugee  Resettlement Advisory Council  Monday, 24 March 2008 

 The Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services, Laurie  Ferguson, today announced appointments for a fifth term of the Refugee  Resettlement Advisory Council (RRAC). 

 The RRAC was established in 1997 as an expert policy group on refugee and  humanitarian settlement matters and will continue to provide recommendations to the  government on priorities for settlement services. 

 'The council advises on the appropriateness and adequacy of Australian Government  services, priorities in settlement planning and community feedback,' Mr Ferguson  said. 

 In previous terms, the council served as an external reference group to the Review of  Settlement Services for Migrants and Humanitarian Entrants, contributing input during  the implementation of the review's recommendations, and the Interdepartmental  Committee on Humanitarian Settlement, convened in 2006. 

 Bruce Baird has agreed to chair the council and brings valuable expertise to the  position as a former federal and state parliamentarian with an interest in refugee and  humanitarian settlement issues. 

 The council will also be composed of the following members: 

 Paris Aristotle AM                                         Margaret Piper 

 Paul Power                                                    Carmel Guerra 

 Mohamad Issa                                               Samia Baho 

 Jenny Semple                                                Kevin Liston 

 Daniel Zingifuaboro 

 'All members bring a wide range of experiences to the council, either as former  refugees themselves or by working directly with refugees and migrants during the  settlement period,' the parliamentary secretary said. 

 Mr Ferguson acknowledged the return of four former members to the council and  extends a special welcome to new members Bruce Baird (chair), Paul Power, Daniel  Zingifuaboro, Mohammed Issa, Samia Baho and Jenny Semple. 

 The council's term will run from 19 March 2008 until 30 June 2010.
