 Bouncing the Ball between the Courts and the Legislature:  What is the score on refugee issues? By Susan Kneebone*

 Paper presented at the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law Conference “Human Rights 2003: The Year in Review 4 December 2003 CUB Malthouse - Melbourne

 Abstract

 The broad purpose of this paper is to examine recent developments in refugee law and policy and the interaction between the Australian courts and the legislature. I examine the role of the courts and the extent to which they have acted and can act as guardians of human rights on these issues.

 In particular I examine how the courts have responded to recent legislative measures to limit the application of the Refugees Convention in Australian law by narrowing the refugee definition, and to restrict judicial review.  Paradoxically these measures coincide with a judicial broadening of the refugee definition by the High Court in the Khawar decision and an expansion of the concept of jurisdictional error as a result of S157 \ 2002 v Commonwealth.

 I argue that the legislative measures to limit the refugee definition are inconsistent with international law and international jurisprudence.  I demonstrate that they have led to much confusion and increased litigation.  In my view these legislative measures should be repealed, and the application of the refugee definition should be left to the courts to apply in accordance with the Refugees Convention.

 Background and Introduction

 My brief for this paper was to examine recent important decisions of the High Court in the refugee jurisdiction.  As this jurisdiction is one where in recent years we have seen an open tension between the courts and the executive, it is appropriate to declare my hand at the outset.  My view is that the courts are the ‘Third Arm of Government’ in partnership with  the  other  branches  of  government.1   I  see  their  role  as  essentially  to  uphold  the values  of  the  common  law  and  human  rights.   This  is  an  essential  role  in  this  setting

 where the rights of non-citizens are in danger of being eroded as a response to ‘popular politics’.2   Clearly  this  view  implies  a  particular  view  of  democracy.   Thus  as  summer approaches,  the  tennis  metaphor  seems  an  appropriate  one  -  let  us  watch  the  ball bouncing  back  between  the  legislature,  expressing  the  wishes  of  the  executive,  and  the judicial ‘courts’.

 The background to this paper begins in August 2001 with the MV Tampa episode and the subsequent  passage  of  a  package  of  far  -  reaching  legislation  passed  in  haste.   This legislation  included  the  Migration  Legislation  Amendment  (Judicial  Review)  Act  2001 which replaced Part 8 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) with a general privative clause on judicial  review  of  decisions  of  the  RRT.   It  also  included  the  Migration  Legislation Amendment  Act  (no  6)  (MLAA  (no  6))3  which  purports  to  amend  the  definition  of refugee under Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees4 (Refugees  Convention).   In  particular,  s91R  defines  the  meaning  of  ‘persecution’, stipulates  the  nature  of  the  causal  link  required  to  establish  ‘persecution’  for  a Convention reason, and limits the bringing of sur place claims.  Section 91S attempts to limit the application of the ground of ‘membership of a particular social group’ in relation to family members.  I will consider the impact of these amendments.

 I will also consider the application of the potentially expansive decision in Minister for Immigration v Khawar,5 (Khawar) which the High Court handed down in April 2002.  In that case it was held that a married woman from Pakistan who claimed that she was the victim  of  serious  and  prolonged  abuse  by  her  husband,  and  that  the  police  in  Pakistan refused to enforce the law against such violence or otherwise offer her protection, could arguably satisfy the test for a ‘refugee’ within the meaning of the Refugees Convention as a ‘member of a particular social group’.  In the Khawar decision, McHugh and Gummow JJ  stress  the  Refugees  Convention  context  of  Australia’s  protection  obligations  as

 incorporated  into  the  Migration  Act.6   They  also  emphasise  the  Convention’s  concern with non-refoulement.  Typically in previous decisions the dissenting judges would refer to the human rights framework of the Refugees Convention, but the majority view was typified  by  the  judgment  of  Gummow  J  in  Minister  for  Immigration  v  Ibrahim7 who emphasised  the  domestic  legislative  context  as  the  source  of  rights.8   He said that ‘the right of asylum is a right of States, not of the individual’.9

 The next important development was the decision of the High Court in February 2003 in S157  \  2002  v  Commonwealth10  which  settled  the  controversy  which  had  raged  in  the Federal Court since October 2001 over the validity and interpretation of the new privative clause.  In S157 \ 2002 the High Court determined that the clause was valid, and that it should  be  interpreted  according  to  ordinary  notions  of  ‘jurisdictional  error’.   This potentially  allows  for  the  review  of  decisions  in  a  broad  range  of  circumstances  where there is loosely, an ‘error of law’.11  The significance of this decision is that it married the emerging jurisprudence over the central importance of s75(v) of the Constitution for the High Court’s judicial review jurisdiction,12 and established notions of civil liberties with an understanding of the importance of human rights, and international obligations in the refugee context.13  This contrasts with previous High Court decisions on the validity of Part  8.   For  example,  in  both  Abebe  v  Minister  for  Immigration14  and  in  Minister  for Immigration  v  Eshetu15  the  High  Court  relied  heavily  on  principles  of  interpretation  in concluding that Part 8 did not affect the High Court’s s 75(v) jurisdiction.

 To complete the background picture, I should mention Al Masri16and related decisions in which the courts have clipped the wings of the executive by imposing limits on the statutory powers to detain non-citizens and children.  This issue is very much in the public eye and is aired by the media.  Here I will concentrate on the more subtle but extremely significant play between the courts and the legislature over the refugee definition.  This also involves the relationship between the Refugees Convention and other human rights treaties and the Migration Act.  But here my discussion is specifically

 about the application of MLAA (no 6) and Khawar and the play between the courts and the legislature.

 For the purpose of this paper a search was done of all decisions in which s91R or s91S of MLAA (no 6) was discussed17 and of all decisions in which S157 \ 2002 was applied in relation to the refugee definition.18  Thus the following paper is a report or audit on decisions relating to the refugee definition in recent times.

 Executive versus Judiciary:  Migration Legislation Amendment Act (no 6)

 Let me begin with an analysis of MLAA (no 6) s91R (which is set out in Appendix 1). The Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill states:

  Approximately 21 decisions were examined.  As explained in the previous footnote there was an overlap between the two categories.

 1.The purpose of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2001 (the Bill) is to amend the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) to restore the application of the Convention …. in Australia to its proper interpretation; and promote integrity in protection visa application and decision-making processes.  ….

 3.Over recent years the interpretation of the definition of a refugee by various courts and tribunals has expanded the interpretation of the definition so as to require protection to be provided in circumstances that are clearly outside those originally intended.

 The suggestion that Australian courts were going beyond the scope of the Refugees Convention was referring in particular to decisions on the ‘social group’ ground which as we will see have tested the limits of the Convention.  These included decisions where the ground for refugee status was domestic abuse, or gender or sexuality, as well as situations involving what the government sees as ‘private abuse’ at the hands of non-state agents. The comment about ‘integrity’ referred in part to sur place claims which I will also refer to.  This refers to persons who claim asylum on the basis of activities in the country of refuge or asylum.

 In September 2001 I made a submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee in which I concluded:  ‘In summary, my view is that none of these amendments is necessary or desirable.’  I stated:

 …. it is a basic principle that international instruments should be interpreted consistently both nationally and internationally.  These amendments will potentially lead to Australian jurisprudence being out of line with international interpretation of the Convention.  Currently the Australian courts are interpreting the Convention in a moderate, not generous way.  These amendments are simply unnecessary.  They will add another layer of complexity to interpretation of Art 1A.  [Next], one can query whether many of these provisions comply with the principle of ‘good faith’ interpretation of international obligations as required by Art 31 of the Vienna Convention.

 A final general comment is that the High Court has emphasised on many occasions that the Refugees Convention cannot be interpreted too legalistically - that the definition in Art 1A cannot be broken up into strict components.  Yet this is the effect of most of these provisions.

 As I will elaborate, my concerns were justified.  Further as a colleague Dr Pene Mathew of the Law Faculty at ANU predicted,19 the legislation has led to an increase in applications for judicial review.20

 ‘Persecution’ under s91R and human rights protection

 I want to now examine the terms of s91R and the meaning of ‘persecution’.  This is a concept which is fundamental to the refugee definition.  The explanatory memorandum suggested that the courts had expanded the scope of the Convention, so that that the legislature had to restore the proper meaning.  In my view this charge was not made out. The amendment has had the reverse effect of taking the interpretive approach to the definition in the opposite direction to the Convention and the appropriate principles of statutory interpretation where a treaty is involved.  Although s91R is not textually very different to the established case law, it does have the potential to bring in a ‘creep’ effect of ignoring the human rights framework.

 The drafting history of the Convention establishes that the term ‘persecution’ was left deliberately undefined.  The established principles of international jurisprudence under the Convention are clear that the meaning of persecution is to be determined in the human rights framework.  Whilst its core meaning includes deprivation of life or physical freedom, it also means ‘severe pain or suffering whether physical or mental, intentionally inflicted’ taking the cue from the Convention Against Torture’s definition of ‘torture’. The jurisprudence suggests that the hierarchy of human rights, civil and political rights, followed by economic, social and cultural rights is relevant in assessing whether there is persecution.  Persecution is for example to be distinguished from ‘mere’ hardship or discrimination as the courts have continued to recognise in applying s91R.21  But it is always a matter of evaluation against the human rights background.

 The language of s91R, the reference to ‘serious harm’, and ‘systematic and discriminatory conduct’ is not very different to the definition of persecution that was formulated by the High Court in Chan Yee Kin v Minister for Immigration.22  In that case McHugh J gave the leading judgment.  He defined persecution as involving selective harassment or systematic conduct directed at an individual or a group - but he also said that a single act23 may suffice.24  Although the non-exhaustive statutory definition of serious harm (‘Without limiting’) emphasises physical harm and subsistence and does not specifically refer to mental harm, it has been decided that it includes psychological harm.25  On one level s91R could be said to be useful in spelling out in an non-exhaustive way the types of harms that amount to persecution.  Indeed in several cases the judges have said as much.  But as I argue this is at the expense of the human rights framework.

Eg NAPX v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCA 85 (7 February 2003);  NAGT v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCA 149 (7 February 2003) - threats, including phone calls, did not constitute harm amounting to persecution. 22

 The crucial difference between McHugh J’s analysis in Chan Yee Kin and the statute, is that he related the meaning of persecution to basic human rights, as did other members of High Court.26  More recently in Ibrahim McHugh J expressly moderated his comments in Chan Yee Kin and emphasised the human rights dimension of the concept.  He described persecution as:

  …. unjustifiable and discriminatory conduct directed at an individual or group for a Convention reason…which constitutes an interference with the basic human rights or dignity of that person or persons in the group…which the country does not authorise or does not stop, and…which is so oppressive or likely to be repeated or maintained that the person threatened cannot be expected to tolerate it, so that flight from, or refusal to return to that country is the understandable choice of the individual concerned.27

 Gaudron J similarly described persecution as ‘sustained discriminatory conduct’.28

 The human rights framework was also emphasised by the High Court in Chen Shi Hai v Minister for Immigration29 it which it was decided that a ‘black child’ born to a couple contrary to China’s one child policy, who was denied basic rights to education, food and health was a member of a ‘social group’.  This policy, said the High Court, ‘offends the standards of civil societies … [and] of the civilized world’.30

 My observations about the general interpretation of s91R and ‘persecution’ are as follows: â¢ Many judges are ignoring or at least failing to articulate, the international law and human rights context of s91R.  I have not seen any reference to the principles of

 interpretation in Art 31 of the Vienna Convention for example, which were discussed at length by the High Court in Applicant A v Minister for Immigration.31 â¢ There is uncertainty as to the interrelationship between s91R and the Convention. In some cases the judges have confirmed that the Convention applies ‘without

 limiting’ the statute.32  In other cases judges have queried whether s91R limits the Convention.33  In others the judges have suggested that it does34 but in others that the two are consistent.35 â¢ Two approaches to interpretation of the meaning of ‘persecution’ have developed.

 In most cases judges examine the alleged acts of persecution individually to see

 whether they each literally come within s91R’s definition of persecution, without taking a ‘global’ view of the facts.  And that is the essential and crucial and fundamentally worrying point about s91R’s definition of persecution - that it can be applied out of context, as one judge described it, as a simple question of fact.36 I will examine some cases on religious persecution below to show the differences in result between this approach and those decisions in which the judges apply the second approach and look at the issue globally and implicitly (rarely, explicitly) recognise the human rights framework of the Convention and the setting for interpreting s91R. â¢ These cases demonstrate that judges are failing to apply the refugee definition

 holistically.  Section 91R relates to some but not all aspects of the Convention Article 1A(2) definition, but judges are allowing the statute to dominate their reasoning.

 The very disturbing aspect of s91R arises from the fact that refugee law is international. Up to this point the jurisprudence of the Australian High Court on refugee issues has been highly regarded in the top courts in the United Kingdom and the USA.  For example the decision in Applicant A was referred to as authority in the House of Lords decision of Islam v Home Department; R v Immigration Appeal Tribunal ex parte Shah37 (Islam and Shah) (and in turn that decision was applied in Khawar).  But with the intrusion of the statute onto the Convention definition, the value and authority of Australian jurisprudence will wane.  Conversely, the scope for application of international

 jurisprudence in Australia will be lessened, and our isolation, our ‘unilateral’ approach to refugee issues, will be compounded.

 Finally, whilst still on the level of generality, let me take one issue which goes to the heart of the rules of the game in this context.  As I mentioned, the comment about ‘integrity’ in the explanatory memorandum referred in part to sur place claims.  It is not

 uncommon for a refugee who flees a place where she has been repressed to become outspoken or active in the country of refuge or asylum.  In a number of cases the courts have recognised sur place claims arising as the consequence of the refugee’s own activities.  They have resisted the imposition of a ‘good faith’ requirement in relation to sur place claims on the basis that this is a ‘gloss’ on the refugee definition.38  The courts have emphasised that natural justice applies to such claims.  In Somaghi v Minister for Immigration,39 Gummow J stressed that the crucial question is whether a person holds a well-founded fear of persecution.  This approach is consistent with the fundamental principle of non-refoulement.

 Section 91R(3) of the Act now states that in determining whether a person has a well-founded fear of being persecuted, the conduct ‘engaged in by the person in Australia’ is to be disregarded unless the person satisfies the Minister that the conduct was not ‘for the

 purpose of strengthening the person’s claim’.  This provision imposes an additional burden on an applicant to establish not only a well-founded fear of being persecuted for Convention reasons, but also that conduct in Australia was bona fide.  This arguably adds an element to the ‘real chance’ of persecution test which requires a weighting of evidence and the prediction of future probabilities.  It potentially collides with the principle of non-refoulement.

 The validity and scope of s91R(3) was challenged in SAAS v Minister for Immigration.40 In that case the applicant, a citizen of Iran, claimed to be a refugee sur place by reason of his  conversion  to  Christianity  since  leaving  Iran.   He  claimed  a  well-founded  fear  of persecution on the ground of his religion.  However the RRT was  not  satisfied  that  the applicant had engaged in Christianity otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening his claim to refugee status.  Mansfield J upheld this decision and also rejected an argument about the validity of the provision.  Mansfield J found that s91R(3) could be supported by both  the  ‘aliens’41  and  ‘immigration’42  heads  of  power,  and  is  a  valid  exercise  of legislative power.  He said however that s91R(3) ‘qualifies or restricts the criterion for a grant of a protection visa’43 in comparison to the previous case law.  I query whether this is consistent with the Refugees Convention.

 That case is a good lead in to the study I now want to make of five cases involving religious freedom.  The purpose of this is to illustrate the general point made above, namely that in determining whether there is ‘persecution’ within the meaning of s91R(1) and (2) it matters whether the human rights framework is taken in account.

 Religion as a ground for persecution and s91R

 The ground of religion is one of the five Refugees Convention grounds referred to in the Article 1A(2) definition.  MLAA (no 6) s91R does not attempt to define the grounds, although it does says something about the nexus that must exist between the ground and the persecution as we shall see next.  That in turn affects how the grounds are applied as I will explain.  Leaving that issue aside for one moment, it is clear that the courts are concentrating upon the meaning of ‘persecution’ in s91R, rather than upon the scope of the ground, in determining whether the applicant comes within the refugee definition.

 Let me begin by explaining the significance of the human rights background.  The meaning of religion and religious freedom takes its measure from Article 18 of the ICCPR which states:

 Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion:  this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in

 

 40  [2002] FCA 726 (11 June 2002). 41  That is, s 51(xix) of the Constitution. 42

 community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.

 It has been stressed that this involves the ability to live freely in accordance with that creed.  The recent decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Wang v Minister for Immigration44 contains a full discussion of the ground.  In that case a Christian member of the Chinese Presbyterian Church in China who attended an unregistered church was persecuted.  The RRT decided that he was not a refugee as he could avoid the persecution by going to a state controlled church.  The Full Court disagreed with this interpretation of the ground.  It concluded that the RRT was in error as it did not answer the question of whether the applicant had a well-founded fear.  Merkel and Gray JJ who relied upon Article 18 of the ICCPR pointed out that the right to religious freedom involved two elements.  First, it involved a manifestation or practice of personal faith or doctrine, and secondly this right is to be exercised in a like-minded community.  They thought that the RRT had ignored the latter element.  Wilcox J came to the same conclusion but without relying on Article 18.  He doubted the relevance of Article 18 to an ‘Australian statute’ (and this was pre s91R - he was referring to the incorporation of the Refugees Convention) but was in any event able to come to same view by applying a dictionary definition of ‘religion’.45  Notably, Merkel J (with whose approach Gray J agreed) relied upon evidence in Human Rights Watch about China’s regulatory regime, as well as international jurisprudence to interpret the ground in accordance with the human rights framework.46

 This ground has become very important as demonstrated by a large number of cases from China47 and Islamic countries.  In many countries with authoritarian and theocratic regimes this ground overlaps with the political opinion ground.48  There are a number of Falun Gong supporters from China who seek asylum.  A typical response was given in NAJT v Minister for Immigration.49  In that case the applicant, a citizen of China claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution on religious or political grounds due to her association with, and the practice of Falun Gong, which is banned under Chinese law.

 Hely J said that it was open to the delegate to conclude that the applicant being only a practitioner and activist within Falun Gong would not likely come to the attention of authorities.  However there was no discussion of the right to religious freedom.  As with cases on ‘political opinion’ the RRT is concerned with characterising the ‘profile’ of the applicant rather than assessing the breach of human rights.50

 I looked at five cases in which s91R was relevant and which involved Iranians of the Sabean Mandaean faith or religious sect.51  According to the discussion in SCAT v Minster for Immigration52 there are about 25,000 of such people of whom 20,000 live in Iraq.  They are followers of the teachings of John the Baptist and are regarded by some as

 Christians and as others as of the ancient Jewish Essenes.  Three out of the five were successful.53  In none of the five cases was there any discussion of the nature of religious freedom or Wang’s case on that issue, even though the facts clearly established a lack of religious freedom.  In one of the successful cases, SCAT v Minster for Immigration,54 there was a submission about religion but the decision turned upon a discussion of s91R and whether the acts alleged constituted ‘serious harm’ or persecution.55

 In SBBG v Minister for Immigration56 and SBAS v Minster for Immigration57 evidence was given of ‘general institutionalised discrimination’ against all Mandaeans in Iran: â¢ The  Mandaean  religion  is  not  recognised  under  the  Iranian  Constitution, Mandaeans thus have no legal rights in respect of their religious beliefs.

 â¢ Under the official religion of Iran, Islam (Ja’fari Shi’ism), Mandaeans are treated as  infidels  and  defiled  persons  who  are  unclean.   Thus  Mandaeans  often  suffer general  abuse  and  vilification  from  their  Moslem  neighbours.   Women,  in particular are often raped and assaulted. â¢ Mandaeans  are  denied  employment  in  the  government  service  and  have  severe

 problems in gaining employment in the private sector.  Thus Mandaean men were generally limited to working with jewellery, especially goldsmithing. â¢ Medical  services  were  withheld  from,  or  provided  at  a  minimal  level  to Mandaeans. â¢ Mandaeans  suffered  discrimination  under  the  legal  system  as  some  remedies

 available  to  Islamic  citizens  are  not  available  to  Mandaeans.   Further  the  police will often withhold protection. â¢ Evidence was given of discrimination in education - that Mandaeans were unable to attend university and that at school they were forced to convert to Islam.

 In SBBG v Minister for Immigration the applicant, his wife and children were successful in  their  applications  for  protection  visas.   They  made  specific  claims  of  persecution  to which they were individually subjected, in addition to general claims of discrimination. For  instance,  the  appellant  claimed  that  he  had  been  assaulted  for  wearing  a  cross,  and that his wife was harassed for non-compliance with the Islamic dress code for women and assaulted by an officer when trying to enrol her daughter in school.  The Tribunal found

 that the appellant and his family suffered societal discrimination due to their faith but was not satisfied that such treatment constituted persecution.

 On  review,  the  Full  Court  (Grey,  von  Doussa  and  Selway  JJ)  held  that  these  acts amounted to ‘serious harm’ within the meaning of s91R.  They were however undecided about  the  effect  of  s91R  on  the  Convention  definition.   The  court  decided  that  on  the authority  of  Chan  Yee  Kin  it  was  arguable  that  what  the  Tribunal  considered  to  be ‘inconveniences,  disruptions  and  limitations’  were  acts  of  persecution  under  the Convention  and  also  ‘serious  harm’.   In  this  case  the  Full  Court  seemed  alive  to  the human rights dimension, although it queried whether the statute had limited the definition of persecution under the Convention.

 The  decision  in  SBAS  v  Minster  for  Immigration58 is  another  case  where  the  applicants succeeded.   In  that  case  the  applicants  (husband,  wife,  and  two  daughters)  claimed persecution  on  the  grounds  of  their  religion,  and  the  imputed  political  opinion  of  the husband.   The  claim  of  political  opinion  arose  out  of  an  incident  which  the  applicants claimed  to  have  occurred  at  their  home  on  18  February  2001  when  two  Muslim  men robbed them, and the police refused to investigate the incident even though aware of the identity  of  the  offenders.   Other  specific  claims  of  individual  incidents  of  persecution included:

 â¢ Regular abuse and vilification by Muslin neighbours, â¢ Threatening letters and phone calls, â¢ Physical  assault  of  the  wife  by  police  when  she  refused  to  disclose  the whereabouts of her husband.

 The  Tribunal  did  not  accept  that  these  events  together  or  taken  separately  constituted persecuted.  However on review Cooper J found that the Tribunal should have considered how the event of 18 February 2001, along with the other general evidence impacted on the  treatment  of  the  applicants,  that  impact  being  cumulative  with  the  other  events  the applicants  claimed  has  impacted  adversely  on  their  lives  due  to  their  religion  and membership of the Mandaean community.  That is Cooper J appeared to take an overall view of these events.  Although he did not refer specifically to Article 18 or Wang’s case, he cited at length from McHugh J’s judgments in Chan Yee Kin.  He was clearly alive to the  human  rights  dimensions.   Cooper  J  found  that  the  RRT  had  made  a  jurisdictional error.

 The  decision  in  SGJB  v  Minister  for  Immigration59 is  an  example  of  an  unsuccessful claim where the court focused upon the scope of s91R.  In this case the applicant, a 24 year old Iranian man, claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution on religious and political grounds.  He gave evidence about discrimination against himself and his family in relation to medical treatment, education, employment and in the exercise of his faith (particularly on holy days).  In addition, the applicant claimed he had a Muslim girlfriend and that he feared persecution at the hands of her family if he returned to Iran.  The RRT accepted  that  Sabeans  were  subjected  to  some  discriminatory  treatment.   Overall,  the

 RRT found that these discriminatory practices (or ‘inconveniences’ as the RRT described them) did not amount to persecution.  The RRT was also of the view that the story of the Muslim girlfriend was fabricated.  On review Jacobson J said, referring to McHugh J’s statement in Ibrahim, that the relevant question is whether the RRT in finding that these discriminatory  practices  did  not  constitute  persecution,  asked  itself  whether  such  acts were so oppressive that the applicant could not be expected to tolerate them.  Jacobson J considered that overall the RRT had addressed the relevant question.  Thus, there was no error  of  law.60   In  this  case  the  applicant  was  unable  to  prove  specific  instances  of

 discrimination, and thus unable to establish a ‘well-founded fear of persecution’.

 Similarly in SBBA v Minster for Immigration61 the court focused upon whether the fact that different rules apply to Sobbis (part of the Sabean Mandean religion) for the payment of  blood  money  in  cases  of  murder,  accidental  death  or  bodily  injury,  amounted to‘serious harm’.  According to Weinberg, Stone, and Jacobson JJ, the harm arising from such discrimination did not satisfy the serious harm test under s91R.

 These decisions demonstrate that the effect of ss91R(1) and (2) is to fragment consideration of claims.  The courts are concentrating on the meaning of ‘persecution’ and not considering the refugee definition holistically.  They are not taking enough care to root the discussion in the Convention context, even though s91R clearly refers to the Convention.  It is simply being ignored.

 But the following decision illustrates that post S157 sometimes an applicant can succeed on procedural grounds even though the substantive ground is not made out.  NAAG of 2002 v Minister for Immigration62 concerned the application of s91R(3) of the Act and the rejection of a sur place claim by the RRT.  The applicant, a woman student from Iran had been politically active in Iran.  She had been imprisoned and whilst incarcerated had been raped by her captors.  She fled to Australia and claimed that she was a refugee on the basis of her political opinion and religion, as well as her membership of a particular social group.  She had converted to Christianity whilst in Australia.  The RRT relied upon

 s91R(3) in rejecting her claim on the basis of religion.63  Her claims about political activities were largely regarded as ‘implausible’.  In relation to her ‘particular social group’ claim, the RRT said the rape was ‘a deeply unfortunate but ad hoc, opportunistic act … not indicative of how her [political] participation … was regarded.’64

 At the RRT hearing, the applicant had difficulty in giving evidence about the rape, but the member assured her that if it were to have ‘any concerns later I will … give you an opportunity to respond’.  On review the Full Court of the Federal Court found that the RRT could only have described the rape in the terms used if it ignored or rejected her evidence about its circumstances.  They found that this amounted to a denial of natural                                                           

 60  However, Jacobson J did conclude that the decision maker had denied procedural fairness and the case was remitted to the RRT. 61

 justice which was a jurisdictional error in accordance with S157 \ 2002.  The Full Court considered that the evidence indicated that the rape related to her political opinion.

 The nexus requirement

 The need for a nexus comes from the words ‘by reason of’ in Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention.  This requires a link between the persecution and a Convention ground.  In Chen Shi Hai the High Court described this as a ‘common thread’ that links the persecution and the grounds.  But in that case the High Court declined to lay down a prescriptive approach to causation.  Indeed, the High Court eschewed such an approach on the facts of that case.  However, the legislation now prescribes in s91R(1)(a) that Article 1A(2) does not apply unless ‘that reason (or ‘reasons’) is the essential and significant reason (or ‘reasons’)’.  This was an attempt to tighten up the nexus requirement and to forestall claims on grounds such as domestic violence.  The irony is that the Khawar decision interpreted the nexus requirement broadly in this context and has been followed in subsequent cases.  At the same time there is evidence that s91R(1)(a) has tightened the approach to the nexus requirement.  This simply adds to the current confusion in Australian refugee law.

 The words in s91R(1)(c) requiring persecution to involve ‘systematic and discriminatory conduct’  are  also  relevant  to  the  nexus  requirement.   McHugh  J  said  in  Chan  Yee  Kin, that  persecution  involves  conduct  directed  at  an  individual  or  group.   As  he  further explained  in  Applicant  A65  persecution  requires  that  persons  ‘must  be  victims  of intentional  discrimination  of  a  particular  kind’.   Such  conduct  or  discrimination establishes the ‘common thread’.

 One technique which developed to require a strong causal link was to concentrate on the motivation of the persecutor.  In Applicant A for example the High Court stressed that the ‘one child policy’ was not one of the central government but was rather one ‘carried out by zealous local officials’.  This decision and other involving actions by non-state agents suggest that unless the state or central government is involved in the persecution, it is not ‘by reason of’ a Convention ground.  Similarly persons affected by situations of general violence or laws of ‘general application’ have difficulty in establishing the nexus.66  In a number of cases persons who are the victims of general violence, as for example members of the Hazara community in Afghanistan,67 or Tamils subject to violence in Sri Lanka68 have been unable to establish that they are ‘persecuted’.

 In some Federal Court cases this need for a causal link was read as requiring a positive discriminatory motive for the persecution, thus narrowing the meaning of persecution. However the High Court in Chen Shi Hai disapproved this trend.

 In Chen Shi Hai the High Court accepted a statement of French J at first instance when he said that:

 Motivation connecting persecution to the relevant attribute is sufficient. Persecution may be carried out coolly, efficiently and with no element of personal animus directed at its objects.  There are too many examples of inhuman indifference of which governments are sometimes capable … The attribution of subjectively flavoured states ….to governments and institutions risks a fictitious personification of the abstract and the impersonal.69

 The courts have recognised that there are often multiple motives for persecution by governments or their agents.  Section 91R encourages decision-makers to focus upon the motivation or motivations of the persecutor contrary to established jurisprudence.  The limits of relying on motivation for the causal connection with persecution are illustrated by the fact that there are often several motivations for acts of persecution.  For example, in Islam and Shah, Lord Hoffmann pointed out that harassment of the Jewish population in Nazi Germany proceeded from dual motives, that is business rivalry and indirectly because of their Jewishness (race).

 In Chen Shi Hai the High Court made it clear that persecution covers both passive and active action.  For example, it is well recognised that simply standing by when elements of the civil population smashed up the property of landowners in Communist states constituted persecution.  In rejecting the motivation argument, the High Court in Chen Shi Hai accepted that persecution can ‘result from the highest of motives, including an intention to benefit those who are its victims’.70  The discussion of the High Court in Chen Shi Hai made it clear that the causal issue is one of evidence - was the state unable or unwilling to protect the individual?  Is there evidence that the person is ‘targeted’ or sufficiently discriminated against to constitute persecution?  Importantly many of these arguments were accepted in Khawar.

 Sections 91R(1)(a) and (c) are inconsistent with the developed jurisprudence.  Section 91R(1)(c) encourages decision-makers to concentrate upon conduct as such rather upon the resulting breaches of human rights.  Section 91R(1)(c) requiring persecution to involve ‘systematic and discriminatory conduct’ contemplates positive action rather than resulting ‘intentional discrimination’ as McHugh J suggested.

 The  decision  in  NACQ  v  Minister  for  Immigration71  illustrates  the  application  of s91R(1)(a) and a narrow nexus approach.  The applicant, a citizen of Palestine, claimed that he feared persecution from Israeli spies, due to his political opinion and membership of  a  social  group,  if  he  were  to  return  to  Palestine.   The  applicant  submitted  that  the particular social group was membership of a family closely aligned to the PLO, through the  activities  of  the  applicant’s  brother.   On  the  facts,  the  Tribunal  found  that  the

 applicant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution as the harm feared was aimed at him as a (‘private’) individual and was not due to a Convention reason.  On the basis of s91R(a) the essential and significant motivation for the persecution was not a Convention reason.  The Tribunal also found that the family was not a social group.72  On review the Full Court found that the Tribunal committed no error.

 Judiciary versus Executive:  the Khawar decision

 The High Court decision in Khawar has had a significant impact in two respects.  First in relation to the nexus issue and persecution by non-state agents, and secondly in relation to the ‘social group’ ground.

 Khawar and non-state agents / motivation

 In Khawar  the  Minister’s  main  argument  was  directed  at  the  need  for  a  causal  link between  the  ground  and  the  persecution.   Basically  the  Minister’s  argument  was  that private  ‘persecution’  in  the  form  of  domestic  violence  where  non-state  actors  are involved  does  not  come  within  the  scope  of  protection  obligations  under  the  Refugees Convention.  In Islam and Shah the House of Lords found that the causal connection was established upon proof of failure of the state taking action in relation to the persecution. The High Court in Khawar accepted this approach.  The following cases demonstrate the application  of  this  approach  which  potentially  conflicts  with  NACQ  v  Minister  for Immigration and the application of s91R(1)(a) discussed above.

 In SBBK v Minister for Immigration73 the applicant (an Iranian citizen), argued she would be persecuted if she returned to Iran, for reasons of her membership of a particular social group, namely women or divorced women in Iran, or women in such a grouping who are exposed to violence in circumstances where effective protection from State authorities or other agencies will not be available.  The applicant had divorced her husband, but later agreed  to  a  temporary  re-marriage  for  one  year.   During  the  temporary  marriage,  the applicant fled the country.  She feared return to Iran as she believed her husband would kill her.  The RRT considered that if the husband were to harm the applicant it would be for purposes of revenge and that such harm would fall outside the Convention definition.

 On review, Tamberlin J applying Khawar found that the persecution claimed in this case was the ‘discriminatory inactivity’ of State authorities in not responding to the violence of a non-State authority.  Tamberlin J stated that if the husband was determined to cause her  harm  and  no  protection  was  given,  this  could  amount  to  persecution  under  the Convention.  Tamberlin J also said that the motivation to inflict harm is not conclusive as

 

 72  This aspect of the decision is probably erroneous - it appeared to have been made with s91S in mind.  The case is discussed below in relation to s91S. 73

 Castan Centre for Human Rights Law Conference “Human Rights 2003: The Year in Review” 4 December 2003

 indicated  in  Khawar,  as  the  persecution  lies  in  the  discriminatory  inactivity  of  State authorities and not to the subjective motivation of the non-state actor.74

 WAFH v Minister for Immigration75 involved an applicant who sought a protection visa on the basis that he had a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis  of  his  political activities  in  Iran  from  State  tolerated  organisations  including  Hezbollah.   The  court accepted that after Khawar, it must be accepted that harm or discriminatory conduct need

 not  be  sanctioned  by  the  State  before  it  can  be  persecution  within  the  meaning  of  the Convention.   Serious  harm  which  is  either  condoned  or  tolerated  by  the  state  could  be persecution.76  But in this case the court found that there was no evidence to suggest that the Tribunal had adopted a wrong test for the meaning of persecution.  However in SFGB v Minister for Immigration77 the court found that the Tribunal had made a jurisdictional error (in the S157 sense) when it failed to properly apply this test to a Hazara applicant from Afghanistan.

 Khawar and ‘membership of a particular social group’

 Subject to one exception, s91R does not directly cover the Convention grounds, although as explained above it was intended to limit the application of the grounds in the definition through restriction of the nexus requirement.   The one exception is s91S which attempts to restrict the social group ground in its application to families (this is discussed below). The social group ground is regarded as the most amorphous of all the Convention grounds.  It has been used to argue for refugee status on the basis of the one child policy and its effect on children, domestic abuse, violence against women, sexuality, conscientious objectors, and persons targeted by mafia type organisations.  Clearly these examples involve instances of human rights abuse in contemporary society.  But the Australian government is particularly keen to limit their use, regarding them as examples which go beyond what it regards as the scope of the Refugees Convention.

 This is one area in which the Australian High Court has led the world in the development of jurisprudence.  The High Court in Applicant A established that a social group must posses an ‘associational’ interest, that is some ‘shared interest or experience in common’. A person is not part of a ‘particular social group’ if the group is defined by its persecution rather than an associational interest.  In Applicant A the High Court stressed that a group cannot be defined by the external fact of persecution - that members of a social group must have associative qualities that go to identity, or as has been said in many cases, that the focus in defining a group is upon what a person is rather than what she or he does.78

 

 74  Cf  NAFP v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCA 241 (Branson J, 13 March 2003) - no evidence of failure of state protection of homosexual. 75

              [2002] FCAFC 429.

 76  Cf  SGNB v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCA 885 (Selway J, 22 August 2003) - no evidence of State condoned persecution but rather of lack of resources.  But note that this is dangerously close to accepting the reasoning in Horvath v Secretary of State [2002] 3 WLR 379 which I have critiqued in S Kneebone ed, The Refugees Convention 50 Years On, chap 11. 77

              [2003] FCAFC 231 (24 October 2003). 78  (1997) 190 CLR 225 at 264 per McHugh J.

 Thus the High Court stressed both the internal and the external aspects of a group’s identity.  The UNHCR in its conclusions on recent consultations recognised the role of both internal and external perceptions.

 The UNHCR in its conclusions also recognised the ‘broad humanitarian purpose’ of the ground.  In Applicant A Dawson J said:

 A fundamental human right could only constitute a unifying characteristic if persons associated with each other on the basis of that right or, it may be added, if society regarded those persons as a group because of their common wish to exercise that right.79

 The importance of the ‘associational’ criteria for the group in establishing the nexus requirement is illustrated by the decision of the High Court in Chen Shi Hai v Minister for Immigration.80  In Chen Shi Hai the issue was whether a ‘black child’ born to Chinese parents subject to the ‘one child policy’ would face persecution by reason of his ‘membership of a particular social group’ if he were to return to China with his parents.

 In that case the RRT recognised that he faced persecution but said that it was not ‘by reason of’ such membership.  The RRT concluded that the nexus was lacking because there was no proof that the state was animated by ‘enmity’ or ‘malignity’.  Further it was argued that this was a law of ‘general application’.

 The High Court in Chen Shi Hai first determined that the child was a member of ‘a particular social group’ (applying the Applicant A methodology).  It concluded that he was a member of such group which was persecuted ‘for what they are’, namely their immutable characteristics arising ‘from the circumstances of their parentage, birth and status’.81  As stated above, the High Court rejected the argument that persecution need be animated by the ‘enmity’ or ‘malignity’ of the persecutor.  It accepted however that the issue of motivation might be relevant in determining whether a person is a part of ‘a particular social group’.  That goes to what the UNHCR calls the ‘visibility’ or external perception of the group.  If the persecution was motivated because the applicant possesses the attributes of that group, the High Court said this was sufficient to establish the nexus.82

 The High Court in Chen Shi Hai rejected the argument that this was a law of ‘general application’ because of the internal characteristic of the group - saying that black children were ‘persecuted for what they are not because of what they have done’83.  Thus this decision potentially laid the way for an expansive reading of the ‘social group’

 ground.

 More recently in Khawar the High Court followed the even broader approach of the House of Lords decision in Islam and Shah.  In Islam and Shah the applicants, two married women from Pakistan argued that if they were forced to return to Pakistan, they would be at risk of being beaten by their husbands, that the state would not protect them and that they were at risk of criminal prosecution for adultery for which the penalty could be flogging or stoning to death.  The Secretary of State argued that they were not part of a particular social group which existed independently of persecution, and that they feared persecution due to the (private) hostility of their husbands rather than because of their membership of a particular social group.  However, the House of Lords found that domestic abuse of women in Pakistan was prevalent, relying on an Amnesty report.  It found that such abuse was either partly tolerated or sanctioned by the state of Pakistan as it did nothing to prevent it.

 The House of Lords in Islam and Shah gave a broad meaning to ‘membership of a particular social group’, saying in response to an argument accepted by the Court of Appeal, that cohesiveness of the group was not an essential requirement.  Lords

 Hoffmann, Steyn and Hope found that because in Pakistan women were discriminated against as a group in matters of fundamental (human) rights and freedoms in comparison to men, as the state gave them no protection, women in Pakistan constituted a ‘particular social group’.84

 Similarly in Khawar Gleeson CJ said:

 …I see nothing inherently implausible in the suggestion that women in a particular country may constitute a persecuted group … And cohesiveness may assist to define a group; but it is not an essential attribute of a group.  Some particular social groups are notoriously lacking in cohesiveness.85

 Other members of the High Court in Khawar defined the characteristics of the women more narrowly.  McHugh and Gummow JJ suggested that the group at its narrowest might be ‘married women living in a household which did not include a male blood relation to whom the woman might look for protection against violence by the members of the household.’86  Kirby J said that:

 [T]here may be a particularly vulnerable group of married women in Pakistan, in dispute with their husbands and their husband’s families, unable to call on male support and subjected to … [threats].87

 In another important recent decision subsequent to Khawar the High Court has indicated that  it  will  apply  the  ‘social  group’  reasoning  to  other  contexts.   In  Dranichnikov  v Minister  for  Immigration;   Re  Minister  for  Minister  for  Immigration  and  Others;  Ex

 

 84  Lord Steyn and Lord Hutton also found they were ‘members of a particular social group’ because of other more narrowly defined characteristics such as being suspected of adultery. 85

 parte Dranichnikov88 a national from Russia, successfully argued that he was a member of  a  particular  social  group  constituting  ‘entrepreneurs  and  businessmen  in  Russia  who publicly criticised law enforcement authorities for failing to take action against crime or criminals’.  The applicant gave evidence that he had joined a number of business people and  had  made  representations  to  the  Mayor  and  attended  public  meetings  to  highlight corruption.   He  claimed  to  have  a  subjective  fear  of  physical  harm  from  criminal activities  of  unknown  persons.   The  Tribunal  rejected  his  application  on  the  basis  that there  was  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  any  persecution  he  suffered  was  due  to  his membership  of  a  particular  social  group  categorised  as  ‘businessmen  in  Russia’.   The High Court had to consider whether the Tribunal erred in misstating the particular social group of which the applicant claimed to be a member of.  It was held by a majority that it had made a jurisdictional error.

 Gummow and Callinan JJ in the majority said that the case was similar to Khawar as it involved a deliberate abstention by authorities from affording protection to a member of an identified group.  They remarked that the group was smaller than in Khawar and thus easier  to  identify  and  define.   Gleeson  CJ  (dissenting)  disagreed.   He  construed  the submission made by the applicant’s solicitors as stressing his status as a ‘businessman’, and ‘businessmen’ as constituting  the  specific  group.   He  agreed with the Tribunal that the most that could be said was that the applicant was a ‘concerned citizen not part of a cognisable  unit  which  could  be  considered  a  particular  social  group’.   That  is,  he considered the nexus to be lacking.

 This contrast demonstrates that it is necessary to define the group both by internal ‘associational’ characteristics as well as the external perception (motivation for persecution, which can include non-action by the state).89  Curiously the argument in the High Court turned solely on the social group as the Full Court of the Federal Court had rejected an argument to expand it to include the ‘political opinion’ of the applicant.  As Kirby J in the majority stressed, the factors which sharpened the focus of the claim included making representations to authorities, and attending public meetings.  This was a case where the two grounds clearly overlapped.

 In two recent cases involving women from Iran who claimed lack of state protection, it was found, applying Khawar, that the failure to identify the social group correctly was a jurisdictional  error.   In  SDAV  v  Minister  for  Immigration;   Minister  for  Immigration  v SBBK90 the Full Court agreed that the RRT’s decision focused on whether references to possible harm could define a social group.  In doing so the RRT decision failed to come to  terms  with  the  central issue of group identity.91   The  Full  Court  said  that  unless  this

In this case applying Khawar it was found that there was no singling out of a particular social group of which the applicant was a member.

 issue  is  addressed  it  is  not  possible  for  a  decision  to  be  made  as  to  whether  there  is  a chance of persecution as a result of being a member of that group.  That is, they recognise the importance of both the internal and external factors.  Following S157 and in light of Khawar,  the  decisions  of  the  Tribunal  involved  jurisdictional  errors  and  were  not

 privative clause decisions.

 Finally  in  SGBB  v  Minister  for  Immigration92 Selway  J  suggested  that  applying  the approach  of  Khawar, Dranichnikov,  and  SBBK,  there  is  no  reason  why  unaccompanied Hazara youths or unaccompanied youths without familial support could not constitute a particular social group.

 Thus the combination of Khawar plus S157 has ensured that the courts have control over the meaning of ‘social group’ and the Convention’s application to contemporary human rights  abuses.93   That  is,  unless  the  government  decides  to  introduce  legislation  to overturn the effect of Khawar as it has done in another type of ‘social group’ to which we now turn.

 The family as a social group:  Section 91S

 Section 91S is a direct response to the decision in MIMA v Sarrazola.94  In that case the applicant claimed that her family was targeted by thugs who sought to extort protection money from her.  She claimed that this arose from her deceased brother’s criminal activities.  The RRT applied a ‘motivation’ test and found that the persecution was for a ‘private’ reason, namely money, and thus that the applicant was not entitled to refugee status.  The Full Court of the Federal Court disagreed and found that the family could be described as a social group, and thus that she was targeted because of her membership of that group.95  A second Full Court upheld this decision, on the basis that the question to be asked by the RRT was whether ‘the family unit considered to be a social group is publicly recognised as being set apart as such’.96  By contrast, the RRT had erred by considering whether the particular family was differentiated in the Columbian community by reason of its fame or notoriety.

 This decision was followed in other cases97 and applied in two further extortion cases.  In Rajaratnam98 it was applied to a Tamil harassed by the Sri Lankan army and in Ramirez99 to a person harassed by Colombian guerillas.100

 In s91S the Australian government attempted to legislate away the effect of MIMA v Sarrazola which the Australian government regards as a case involving ‘privately’ motivated persecution which is not persecution for a ‘Convention reason’.  Section 91S states that in claims on the basis of membership of a family group, decision-makers are to ‘disregard any fear of persecution, … that any other member … of the family has ever experienced, where the reason for the fear’ does not come within the refugee definition. The express intention of this legislation is acknowledged in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill and in the Bills Digest.101  Despite the recognition by Dawson J in Applicant A102 that a family could constitute a social group, and the support for this view in international jurisprudence, the Australian government considers that the courts have expanded the scope of the refugee definition beyond its original meaning.  This section has been applied in several recent decisions to exclude claims based upon family membership which might otherwise have been found to come within the Refugees Convention.

 For example, in the recent decision of WAHB v Minister for Immigration103 a young man claimed that as the member of a family of Tajik ethnicity and a minority religion he was targeted by the Taliban in Afghanistan, and that he was a refugee.  However, one aspect of  the  evidence  for  his  claim  related  to  his  teenage  sister  and  the  desire  of  an  elderly Taliban warlord to marry her against her wishes.  This, said the court did not constitute a Convention reason, and applying s91S his application for refugee status was rejected.  In

 that case the Tribunal, referred to S91R(1)(a) and rejected the applicant’s argument that the actual or imputed political opinion was the essential reason behind the Commander’s actions.  On review French J said that s91S did not exclude the possibility that a person could  claim  a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution  by  reason  of  membership  of  a  family group where the reason for such persecution falls within the definition of the Convention. Thus, if members of a family group are in fear of persecution due to the political views of one of their members, such a fear is not to be disregarded by reason of s91S.  Also, if a member of a family is a member of a particular social group and as a result is persecuted, and  where  other  members  of  the  family  are  at  risk  of  persecution  on  account  of  their membership of that family, s91S does not apply.  However French J said that in this case the  Tribunal  was  not  obliged  to  consider  whether  the  sister  was  a  member  of  a  social group  defined  as  ‘young  girls’  as  he  doubted  whether  such  a  group  could  have  been established on these facts.  However, it is not clear that this is consistent with Khawar’s case and the ‘social group’ approach outlined above.

 My observation is that s91S is being applied mechanically without proper consideration of  the  social  group  ground.   The  decision  in  NACQ  v  Minister  for  Immigration104

 discussed above is a relevant example.  Further, in SCAL v Minister for Immigration105 the applicant was a citizen of Albania.  He contended that he would be killed as a result of the blood feud with another family in Albania.  He argued that he was a member of a particular  social  group,  namely  a  family  where  the  male  members  were  targets  of  the blood  feud.   He  submitted  that  the  social  group  was  ‘citizens  of  Albania  who  are subject to the operation of the customary law known as the Kanun.’  He gave evidence that the rules of the blood feud required a male member of one family to be killed as a matter  of  honour  where  a  member  of  that  family  had  been  involved  in  the  killing  of another family.  The applicant claimed his family still owed blood and he was the only person left to be killed.  On review von Doussa J upheld the decision of the Tribunal to reject his claim.  von Doussa J’s view was that the applicant’s definition of social group embraced  everyone  in  the  geographic  areas  of  Albania  where  the  customary  law  was applied.106   A similar decision  was  reached  in  SZABL  &  Anor  v  Minister  for Immigration107 following SCAL.108   In  another  Albanian  blood  feud  case  the  judge rejected  an  argument  that  s91S  limited  the  Refugees  Convention  and  was unconstitutional.109

 In my view the application of s91S puts applicants at risk of refoulement and is contrary to the Refugees Convention.

 Conclusion

 In this paper I have argued that application of s91R and s91S of the Act is resulting in mechanical constructions of the refugee definition, without reference to the human rights context of the Refugees Convention and other treaties.  This is contrary to the principle of ‘good faith’ interpretation of international obligations as required by Article 31 of the

 Vienna Convention.  It is leading to interpretations which are contrary to the Refugees Convention and which put asylum seekers at risk of refoulement.  Sadly, Australian jurisprudence on the refugee definition will soon fall out of line with international jurisprudence if this trend continues.  In my view s91R and s91S which were passed in haste should be repealed immediately.

 Section 91R rather than clarifying the Convention has led to increased challenges on judicial review.  As a result of S157 \ 2002 v Commonwealth there is increased scope to argue jurisdictional error on both substantive and procedural grounds.  The privative clause has thus had the reverse effect and should likewise be repealed.

 On the other side however, the decision in Khawar has opened up the ‘social group’ ground to domestic and other abuses and allowed for persecution by non-state agents.  It also rejects a prescriptive approach to the nexus issue which potentially collides with

 s91R.  There are indications that this is leading to confusion and inconsistency.  This is an additional reason for the repeal of s91R.

 The decisions in Khawar and S157 \ 2002 v Commonwealth demonstrate the courts acting as guardians of human rights in this context.  The analysis of s91R and s91S decisions demonstrates that when the legislature steps in, the waters become very muddied.  In my view the legislative measures should be repealed, and the application of the refugee definition should be left to the courts to apply under the Refugees Convention.

 However, in terms of raw score it seems that the game has not changed markedly.  I note that of 21 challenges I surveyed brought post S157 \ 2002 v Commonwealth involving the refugee definition, only three succeeded and these were the cases about religion discussed above.  In this game it is those whose human rights need protection who are being tossed back and forth.  It should be left to the courts to decide when those human rights need protection, as in Khawar, without legislative intervention.
