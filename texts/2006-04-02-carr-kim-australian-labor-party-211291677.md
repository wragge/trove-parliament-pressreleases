 NEW ZEALAND PLANNING INSTITUTE &  PLANNING INSTITUTE OF AUSTRALIA   

 CONGRESS 2006   

 2-5 April 2006   

 Gold Coast Convention Centre  Gold Coast, Queensland   

 Australia’s Future Cities   

 Senator Kim Carr   

 Shadow Minister for Housing, Urban Development,  Local Government and Territories   

 Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. 

 It is organisations like your own - the national planning institutes of Australia and 

 New Zealand - that are at the forefront of thinking in our respective countries 

 about many of the issues that concern me, as Australia’s Shadow Minister for 

 Housing and Urban Development. 

 And it is appropriate that you are meeting here in South East Queensland, a very 

 rapidly growing region that is, as I understand it, expected to absorb around a 

 quarter of Australia’s total population growth over the next 25 years.  The State 

 government has predicted that during this time the region will require an extra 

 700 000 dwellings, averaging some 35 000 per annum.   

 In December last year I released a broad-ranging discussion paper on urban 

 development, housing and local government policy. 

 The paper’s aim was to lift debate about these issues into the national sphere. 

 Why?  Because it is becoming increasingly clear that Australia needs a 

 government with a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental importance 

 of urban development and housing to the nation’s economic and environmental 

 health, as well as to the lives of individuals. 

 Our capital cities account for around two thirds of our GDP.  How well they work 

 has a major impact on our national productivity and the efficiency of our 

 manufacturing and distribution systems. 

 But the Howard Government ignores these critical issues and instead claims to 

 be pursuing increased productivity by introducing an industrial relations system 

 that will reduce wages and conditions for ordinary workers. 

 Implicit in the Howard Government’s extremist industrial relations agenda is a 

 move towards a lower paid, low skilled workforce. 

 Labor says that Australia should be competing with the high skill, high 

 productivity nations of the world, rather than engaging in a race to the bottom.  

 We say that sustaining the functionality and liveability of our cities is an essential 

 part of securing Australia’s prosperity into the future. 

 The liveability of our cities is one of Australia’s great advantages in competing for 

 skills and investment in a global economy.  

 We all know that, for individuals and families, access to decent, secure, 

 affordable housing is an essential precondition for a good life.  So that fact that 

 Australia currently has “the most pervasive housing affordability crisis” amongst 

 the six developed, English speaking countries surveyed by Demographia is not a 

 good start for us in attracting skilled migrants. 

 But we also know that merely having a roof over your head is not enough. The 

 social, economic and physical environment in which people live is crucial as well.  

 As a nation where an overwhelming majority of people are urban dwellers, the 

 extent to which our cities meet the needs of their citizens - and potential citizens 

 - will determine Australia’s future. 

 

 Sustainable Cities Report 

 The conference has just heard from Dr Mal Washer MP, who as you know 

 chaired the Inquiry by the House of Representatives Environment and Heritage 

 Committee that resulted in the report, Sustainable Cities. 

 As a bipartisan report, this represents a significant landmark in our national 

 thinking about some crucial aspects of policy affecting cities.  

 Labor strongly supports the vision of the committee that: 

 sustainable cities of the future will be vibrant urban regions which are 

 economically productive, environmentally responsible, and socially 

 inclusive.   

 The Committee’s recommendations tend to focus on the environmental factors 

 and concerns relevant to cities and urban policy.  And the gravity and extent of 

 the challenges we face as a nation in those areas, as we plan, develop and 

 renew our cities, are clear. 

 Beyond its recommendations on environmental matters, however, the report 

 devotes much discussion to broader aspects of sustainability - for example, 

 governance frameworks, planning and settlement patterns, transport 

 infrastructure and building design. 

 So far the Howard Government has failed to respond to any aspect of the 

 Sustainable Cities report. 

 Labor, on the other hand, has released Blueprints on Infrastructure, Fuels and 

 Climate Change which each address concerns identified in the report. 

 And of course there is the discussion paper. 

 

 Response to my discussion paper 

 I am pleased to say that I have received a very positive response to Australia’s 

 Future Cities.  A broad range of stakeholder groups, peak organisations and 

 individuals have publicly and privately welcomed its release. 

 It is my impression that stakeholders are first and foremost happy to see Labor 

 raise, in a national context, the issues that are close to their hearts. 

 It makes a change after ten years of deafening silence at the national level. 

 It makes a change after ten years of calling in vain for a national approach; for 

 national consistency in policy terms; and for the national government to take 

 active responsibility for housing and urban issues. 

 I am grateful for the many thoughtful and helpful responses I have received. 

 This is exactly the kind of conversation I had hoped to generate and I am 

 encouraged by the constructive manner in which the debate is occurring. 

 

 Progress on consultation 

 Now I am really starting to get out and about, actively talking to people about the 

 implications of a fundamental shift in policy for Australian cities. 

 Right across Australia, Labor is conducting forums and seminars to promote 

 debate about this policy in the run-up to our national conference in April 2007. 

 We are still actively encouraging responses to the discussion paper. 

 

 Role of national government in cities 

 The more I talk to people about these issues, the more surprised I am that the 

 current national government shrugs them off. 

 It is patently obvious to Labor that in the area of urban development the 

 Commonwealth must work hand in glove with state, territory and local 

 governments to achieve the kind of Australia we all want to see.  

 A national government that holds itself aloof, that adopts a hands-off, don’t care 

 attitude, will of necessity undercut and sabotage the genuine efforts of other 

 levels of government to improve and enhance the daily lives of Australian 

 citizens. 

 I’ll take two key examples here. 

 The first is airports. 

 The airports of our major cities are significant economic entities in their own right. 

 They have a big impact on their immediate regions and more generally on the 

 economy of their State. 

 For example, Sydney Airport employs, directly and indirectly, well over 170 000 

 people, and contributes $13.6 billion annually to the NSW State Product.  

 Airports these days have associated with them retail outlets, transport and 

 shipping companies, warehousing concerns, car hire, hotels and all kinds of 

 other business activities. 

 Now airports are a clear Commonwealth responsibility. The major ones are on 

 long term lease to private operators, but the terms of their contracts are set by 

 the Commonwealth. 

 Given the size and economic significance of these entities, and their regional and 

 local impact, you would not expect a national government to ignore the urban 

 planning issues, and other economic and social issues, on which airport 

 developments have an impact. 

 I am sure you are all familiar with the myriad problems that have resulted from 

 uncontrolled developments in privatised airport precincts, sanctioned by the 

 national government.  Problems such as: 

 â¢ traffic chaos for both airport users and commuters; 

 â¢ the need for new infrastructure and public transport (which state and local 

 governments have to pay for); 

 â¢ uncertainty and loss of business for competing retailers in the region; and 

 â¢ arguments about the appropriate size of "rate equivalent" payments to local 

 governments.   

 Yet that is exactly what happens now.   

 Take Melbourne’s second airport, Essendon. It’s located well within the city’s 

 northern metropolitan region, on a major freeway. 

 As it has with other airports, the Commonwealth has allowed the managing 

 company, Essendon Airport Pty Ltd, to open up large factory retail outlets on site. 

 This has been done without any reference whatsoever to either state or local 

 government. As a result, the consequential planning issues have not been 

 addressed.  

 The resulting upsurge of traffic to Essendon Airport on weekends, for instance, 

 has caused major chaos and delays on the Tullamarine Freeway. 

 The development has also undermined the investment certainty which used to be 

 offered to competing businesses by state and local government regulations and 

 strategic plans. 

 This problem should have been avoided, and could have been dealt with, if the 

 Commonwealth had worked with the Victorian Government and local government 

 authorities in making decisions about the commercial developments authorised 

 for the airport site. 

 In Perth, the airport operator is Westralia Airports Corporation. This company has 

 been in dispute with the City of Belmont Council about the payment of rates. 

 Airports are located on Commonwealth land and, as such, are not required to 

 pay local government rates. 

 However, the Commonwealth included in the airport company’s contract - as it 

 has in others around the country - a provision for so-called “rate-equivalence”.  

 The inclusion of such a clause was intended to ensure that businesses 

 established within the airport footprint did not receive an unfair competitive 

 advantage over competitors. 

 But Westralia Airports argues that because it does not use the full range of local 

 government services it should not have to pay full fare.  Accordingly, last year, it 

 discounted by a substantial amount - hundreds of thousands of dollars - the sum 

 it handed over to the Council.  

 Westralia Airports believes that it has advice from the relevant Commonwealth 

 department, DOTARS, that this practice is acceptable. 

 The Council, unsurprisingly, has begged to differ. The matter is still in dispute. 

 Once again, this should never have happened.   

 Disputes about development at Canberra, Adelaide, Sydney and Brisbane 

 airports reflect the same arrogance and contempt for due process that has 

 become a hallmark of the Howard Government in its dealings with the states and 

 local governments. 

 Labor is committed to a genuinely cooperative approach to urban planning and 

 development that would mean that our major airports would contribute 

 constructively to local, regional and state economies. 

 The second example of the Commonwealth’s role I want to look at, very briefly, is 

 humanitarian settlement policy. Here again, the current Government has failed 

 to develop effective policy approaches. 

 Our refugees increasingly come from societies that differ sharply from the 

 Australian mainstream.  Family size and structures are different; social mores 

 and expectations are different. 

 To someone who has spent the past ten years living in a refugee camp in the 

 Sudan, an Australian suburb must indeed be foreign in the most profound sense.   

 And this is clearly a Commonwealth responsibility - you cannot make decisions 

 about who comes here without taking some responsibility for how they settle in. 

 Yet I am consistently told by state and local governments in areas with high 

 concentrations of humanitarian entrants that their services are struggling to 

 provide appropriate support to these vulnerable communities because 

 Commonwealth programs are simply not sufficient. 

 Labor believes that our national government must make a stronger commitment 

 to effective programs to ease the transition to Australian life for new arrivals. 

 But specific assistance to humanitarian entrants must be accompanied by urban 

 development policies which identify and address the barriers to inclusion and 

 participation that face all disadvantaged Australians. 

 

 Challenging poverty in our suburbs 

 Which brings me to the broader problem of spatial inequality in our cities. 

 The emergence of neighbourhoods and districts of social exclusion has been 

 identified by the Planning Institute of Australia as a problem that is “clearly 

 national in scope”. 

 Labor believes the national government must take responsibility for challenging 

 poverty in our suburbs. 

 I spoke about this at some length about this in my speech to launch the 

 discussion paper in December, and also last week, so I will not go into detail 

 again today. 

 Suffice to say that the waste of Australia’s human and social capital in our cities 

 is something we simply cannot afford - from either an economic or social 

 perspective. 

 

 Environmental challenges - climate change 

 I mentioned earlier that Labor has already responded to a number of the issues 

 identified in the Sustainable Cities report by putting forward genuine policy 

 alternatives.  One of the areas in which we have made concrete commitments is 

 climate change. 

 We know that climate change will have a profound impact on the health of our 

 cities.  Current Commonwealth government policies are leaving Australia 

 unprepared for that challenge. 

 Under Labor’s Climate Change Blueprint, a Beazley Labor Government will work 

 towards a long-term national target of 60 per cent cuts to Australia’s year 2000 

 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. 

 In terms of practical measures, Labor has proposed providing top-up grants on 

 top of the First Home Owners’ Grant for improving the energy rating of the home 

 purchased. 

 We will work with all levels of government to make five star energy efficiency 

 mandatory for new housing developments; and with energy utilities to establish 

 plans to encourage households to cut energy use. 

 And we will work with public institutions and the Australian car industry to support 

 such initiatives as solar schools and the inclusion of value-for-money green cars 

 in the Commonwealth fleet. 

 More broadly, Labor will increase the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target; build 

 a national emissions trading scheme; focus Australian research on developing 

 renewable energy; encourage industry to take up new and cleaner technologies; 

 and rebuild the CSIRO and guarantee its integrity. 

 

 Infrastructure shortages and Blueprint 

 Another major issue facing all levels of government in Australia is the looming 

 crisis in our national infrastructure. 

 According to the Business Council of Australia’s recent report, released last 

 month, the absence of a national approach to Australia’s infrastructure needs is 

 costing the country’s economy $10 billion annually. 

 The BCA cites traffic congestion, long-term water shortages and energy 

 blackouts as examples of the poor infrastructure outcomes that directly affect 

 quality of life for Australians. As well, they create major uncertainty for business 

 and the economy, as well as direct costs. 

 Rod Pearse, head of the BCA, summarised the report’s findings in The Australian 

 of 23 March 2006. Referring to the BCA Infrastructure Action Plan of 2005, he 

 said: 

 In all areas, it was found that the cause of the problem was not a lack of 

 available funds for infrastructure spending. 

 Instead, as the council has consistently advocated, the scarce resource is 

 proper planning and co-ordination among and within governments. 

 Like the BCA, I note the first signs of progress on some of these crucial issues 

 represented by the agreement at the February 2006 COAG meeting.  

 However, it is concerning that there are no firm timelines for achievement in the 

 agreement. And there is no reference to an independent co-ordinating body for 

 nationally significant infrastructure projects. 

 Labor’s Infrastructure and Investment Blueprint, released by Kim Beazley on 24 

 November 2005, proposes, among other things: 

 â¢ A National Infrastructure Audit; 

 â¢ A National Infrastructure Priority List; and 

 â¢ The creation of Infrastructure Australia, a commonwealth body to drive 

 rebuilding. 

 As the BCA has noted, the key is proper planning and coordination.  Labor’s plan 

 would bring all levels of government to the party, committing to meaningful action 

 in a co-operative way.  

 Labor is also conducting a public inquiry into the Financing and Provision of 

 Australian Infrastructure. 

 

 Better planning and funding for local infrastructure 

 While the focus to date has been on major infrastructure, I believe it is critical - if 

 we are going to address Australia’s housing affordability crisis and the 

 sustainability challenges facing our cities - that the national government also 

 take some responsibility for improving the provision of local infrastructure. 

 There are two aspects to this - understanding what infrastructure is needed and 

 funding it. 

 The discussion paper proposes the development of a national settlement 

 strategy to bring together the evidence about Australia’s settlement trends and 

 to enable all levels of government to plan for the future. 

 The settlement strategy envisaged in the paper would examine expected trends 

 in settlement and identify what is needed to ensure that our communities develop 

 sustainably. 

 It would enable all levels of government to plan for the provision of infrastructure, 

 taking account of expected changes in industry structure, employment demand 

 and demographics. 

 In particular, it could inform decisions about Commonwealth support for urban 

 development, particularly in growth regions. 

 In the last week we have seen significant debate over the impact of government 

 taxes and developer charges on the cost of a new home. 

 But one thing is clear - many state, territory and local government taxes and 

 charges are related to funding the types of local infrastructure which used to be 

 paid for over time through general taxes and council rates. 

 My concern about the increasing use and size of developer charges in this way is 

 two-fold. 

 First, there is an issue of intergenerational equity.   

 The charges on developers and new residents not only increase the cost of new 

 homes, but of established homes which compete in the same market. 

 This effectively provides a windfall gain for the owners of established houses in 

 older suburbs where the infrastructure was paid for by the community as a whole.  

 In doing so, it increases the wealth of existing home-owners at the expense of 

 first home buyers. 

 Second, private funding potentially leads to the privatisation of local infrastructure 

 in new estates and a serious diminution of the public realm. 

 This is something about which I know many in the planning community have 

 expressed grave concern. 

 Labor in government would work with State and local governments to find better 

 ways of financing local infrastructure.   

 I believe we need to be open minded about the financing models we use.  Where 

 bond funding models, for example, will cost less and deliver better outcomes, 

 they should not be dismissed because of an ideological fetish about public debt.   

 As you all know very well, the specific areas of local infrastructure which need 

 attention include: 

 â¢  public transport, especially in new developments on the fringes of cities; 

 â¢ improving stormwater management and water conservation measures; and 

 â¢ ensuring that our outer suburbs have access to world class 

 telecommunications and reliable power supplies.  

 So our commitment is broad and reflects our belief in the collective responsibility 

 of all levels of government in reshaping our cities and planning for the future. 

 And can I tell you there has been an overwhelmingly positive response to Labor 

 raising these issues through the discussion paper. 

 

 Bringing it all together 

 Labor is proposing that we give focus to our commitment by establishing a 

 Commonwealth Minister and Department with specific responsibility for housing, 

 urban development, local government and related issues. 

 The discussion paper also proposes that the national Government establish a 

 network of Commonwealth Urban Development Offices in key areas - for 

 example, areas of rapid growth or severe disadvantage. 

 These offices would have two key purposes: 

 â¢ first, to improve the coordination of Commonwealth urban development and 

 service delivery responsibilities at a regional level; and 

 â¢ second, to promote partnerships between the Commonwealth; state, territory 

 and local governments; the business and not for profit sectors; and local 

 communities. 

 Let me emphasise - we are not talking about a hulking new bureaucracy, but 

 about ensuring that representatives of the national government can be out and 

 about, on the ground, eyeballing their counterparts in state and local government 

 and making sure that the things the Commonwealth is responsible for actually 

 get done. 

 The Commonwealth should also develop, with the states, territories and local 

 government, a national sustainability charter.  Such a charter would set national 

 targets across a number of areas which impact on Australia’s environmental, 

 social and economic sustainability. 

 If is to be effective, however, it must be monitored.   

 Labor is looking at establishing a National Sustainability Council to monitor 

 Australia’s sustainability performance. 

 The proposals for a sustainability charter and council arise in part from the 

 recommendations of the Sustainable Cities report and the submissions made to 

 that inquiry.   

 The ideas appear to have broad support in relation to assessing Australia’s 

 environmental performance. 

 But we do need to do some careful thinking about how social and economic 

 sustainability targets are set and monitored, in addition to environmental targets, 

 and what structures and incentives are most appropriate. 

 

 Conclusion 

 In conclusion, I want to return to the core values that Labor brings to the national 

 debate on the future wellbeing and prosperity of our cities. 

 Labor is the Party of social justice. Housing and urban development policies are 

 fundamentally about the values that are important to Australians - fairness; 

 family and community; and a secure future. 

 Most of us live in cities. Most of us work in cities. We study in cities and our kids 

 go to school. Much of our leisure time is also spent close to home. 

 Labor is committed to developing, with the help of people and organisations like 

 yourselves, a proactive and forward-looking set of policies on cities. 

 In government we will continue with an open and co-operative approach - with 

 stakeholders and, very importantly, with state and local governments.
