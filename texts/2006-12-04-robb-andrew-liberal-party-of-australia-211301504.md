 Media Centre  Tasmanian Projects to Receive Living in Harmony  Funding 

 4 December 2006 

 Development of a performing arts education project and a proposal to  offer a range of neighbourhood house programmes are among two  Tasmanian projects to receive $60 000 in funding announced today.  

 Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and  Multicultural Affairs, Andrew Robb said almost $1.5 million in funding  is being awarded today under the Australian Government’s Living in  Harmony programme.  

 ‘A project being developed by the Hobart City Council will develop a  performing arts education project, theatre-based performance and  discussion for students in years nine to twelve, which will tour several  schools,’ Mr Robb said.  

 ‘As well, a range of neighbourhood house programmes will be  offered, including classes in cooking, computing and craft as a way of  bringing newly-arrived refugees from Africa together with the local  community.  

 ‘Living in Harmony funding will help local organisations across the  country to develop grassroots programmes to promote Australian  values such as fairness, acceptance and fair go and help people  realise the opportunities offered by living in Australia,’ Mr Robb said.  

 The Australian Government is providing the funding to community  groups, schools and local governments to promote mutual respect  and to provide opportunities for people to participate in the Australian  way of life.  

 This year 561 applications were received for the Living in Harmony  funded community projects. Priority went to projects promoting inter-faith, new and emerging communities, schools and those involving  Indigenous Australians.  

 Successful applicants were drawn from all states and territories with  each organisation to receive funding from $5 000 to $50 000 for each  project.
