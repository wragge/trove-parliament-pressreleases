 Greens welcome Climate Council   

 23 September 2013   

 “It’s great news Tony Abbott's attempt to shut down the independent advice of the Climate  Commission has been thwarted," Australian Greens Leader Senator Christine Milne said.   

 "Despite Abbott's repeated attacks on the climate, I am thrilled to hear our top scientists  have formed the Climate Council so they can continue to educate Australians about the  serious impacts of global warming.   

 “I urge Australians to join up and throw their support behind this important initiative.   

  “People around the world are shocked by Abbott's attempts to restrict information on  climate change to ‘government sources’, especially given he wants to stop the press  releases on asylum seekers and his attempts to politicise the Australian Research Council  grants.    

 “With the IPCC report due out in coming days, our top scientists, many of whom were  involved in writing it, will be ready to tell Australians what the science is really saying rather  than seeing it through the lens of what the Murdoch press wants them to believe.   

 “I look forward to continuing to use the work of these experts to advocate for stronger and  faster action on global warming.”
