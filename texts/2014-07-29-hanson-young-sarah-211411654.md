 MEDIA RELEASE   

 Tuesday, 29 July 2014   

 Greens commend Charles Sturt Council’s vote to support young refugees   

 Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison will be hearing from the Charles Sturt Council in South  Australia after they voted last night to call for the return of two refugee students who  were rounded up and taken to a Darwin detention centre a month ago.   

 “I congratulate these councillors who are standing up for their community,” the Greens’  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.   

 “When these students were rounded up and dumped in a Darwin detention centre it sent  a shockwave through the school and its community.   

 “The Woodville High students who spoke at the Council meeting clearly want their  friends back and it’s time the Abbott government listened.   

 “Hopefully, after hearing from the Charles Sturt Councillors, Tony Abbott and Scott  Morrison will realise that these students should be brought back to their community.   

 “With the government acting like this, it’s no wonder that 15 other students have fled in in  fear of being rounded up themselves. As the legal guardian of unaccompanied refugee  children, the Immigration Minister should be caring for these kids, not scaring them into  hiding.   

 “Children should not be caught up in the politics of the day and the Abbott government  must commit to returning these students to their community as soon as possible.”
