 LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON KIM C BEAZLEY MP   

 TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, QANTAS BAGGAGE  COLLECTION AREA, SYDNEY AIRPORT, 12 JUNE 2006   

 E & O E - PROOF ONLY   

 Subjects:     Qantas Baggage Handlers; AWAs; Visit by Indonesian  Delegation; Refugee Newspoll; Queen’s Birthday Honours; Socceroos   

 BEAZLEY:  Howard’s industrial relations system rips away workers’  rights and threatens their ability to pay their mortgages and give their families a  decent income.    

 What we’re here about today is an action taken by the baggage handlers for  Qantas here at Sydney Airport. The workers did the right thing when they  discovered an unsafe procedure associated with a piece of machinery. They  were upheld. The IRC upheld them in their decision on their determination that  they were operating in unsafe conditions. They were all back at work very quickly  after the initial stoppage, because the management recognised that they were  correct in their analysis.    

 And what did John Howard do? John Howard put in place a law that effectively  docked the workers protecting their lives and livelihood four hours pay. Now, if  that four hours pay was being worked at double-time it’s an even bigger slice of a  worker’s income.    

 So, this is what a worker under John Howard is invited to do: risk his life or risk  his mortgage. Risk your life or risk your mortgage. That’s the John Howard  WorkChoices legislation. That the sort of WorkChoice he’s talking about: your life 

 or your mortgage.    

 Now,this is just one of the many reasons why I’m going to rip these laws up and  toss them out. There is no amending them. There is no saving them. These laws  posit an evil prospect for ordinary Australians just struggling to make sure that  they work in a safe environment, make sure that they get proper remuneration.  

 

 JOURNALIST:  Did Qantas have a choice about docking the pay?   

 BEAZLEY:  They don’t have a choice. Qantas does not have a choice  about docking the pay. Under these laws, they have to report the fact that there 

 was that stoppage, irrespective of whether or not the stoppage was valid, and  then they have to dock the workers that four hours pay. This is just part of John  Howard’s war on ordinary Australians.   

 JOURNALIST: You said your system would be a new modern industrial  system. How is it different from the old industrial relations system which was  changed by WorkChoices?   

 BEAZLEY:  John Howard’s rewritten the rule book and we’re going to rip  his rulebook up. And what we’re going to put in its place is a fair and balanced  system, with a fair umpire and with a fair access for workers guaranteed an  ability to get access to penalty rates when they work overtime, when they work  on difficult shifts, when they work on holidays and the like - because Howard has  ripped all that way.    

 So, we’re going to put that in place. We’re going to put in place protections of  workers’ rights. We’re going to have flexibility in our system, but it’s flexibility up,  not flexibility down.  

 

 JOURNALIST: Well, Peter Hendy says you’re taking away pay rises by  ripping up AWAs that might have lost conditions, but they got higher pay.   

 BEAZLEY:  I make no apology for standing up for Australian workers.  Australian workers with these AWAs know exactly what’s aimed at them. All  these AWAs rip away conditions. I’m about flexibility up, John Howard’s about  flexibility down. That’s what John Howard’s AWAs do. That’s why I will not have a  bar of them.   

 JOURNALIST: Won’t cutting AWAs mean a loss in productivity and  increased unemployment? Won’t you reverse the conditions that we currently  have?   

 BEAZLEY:  Productivity comes from employers and employees sitting  down and working out the issues. Productivity actually comes best from collective  agreements. This is not a matter of argument, this is proven. When a workforce  sits down with an employer and they work out how they can get better pay and  the employer demands better productivity, that’s when you get the productivity  increases.    

 All that individual contracts do is rip wages down and remove all the incentive for  employers to sit down a get a more productive activity out of their workforce.    

 JOURNALIST: Last year you said that AWAs, removing all of them, would  be very disruptive. Why have you changed your mind now?   

 BEAZLEY:  Because of John Howard’s legislation. John Howard’s  legislation we now see in full force operation. Spotlight, the AWAs that are being  reported in and revealed in what they do to the Senate Committee a week or two  ago. What they show is that all those AWAs rip away at least some, and many of  them all, those conditions which mean you can afford your mortgage, frankly.    

 JOURNALIST: So, this won’t be disruptive, this will be disruptive?   

 BEAZLEY:  As I have said in relation to AWAs, we will work sensibly  through with all interested parties to ensure that transition arrangements are  easily put in place.  We’re about making life better.  We’re about flexibility up, not  flexibility down, which is what Howard’s about.   

 JOURNALIST: Doesn’t this create a level of uncertainty?   

 BEAZLEY:  This creates no uncertainty whatever.  People will complete  their contracts and then they’ll be able to move into a new system which will give  them decent protection.     

 You’ve got to look at what’s going on around the workforces now.  You’re finding  people being obliged to trade away - not trade away, they’ve had ripped away,  they’re not doing any trading - people are being obliged to sign contracts which  rip away shift allowances, which rip away breaks, which rip away holiday pay,  which rips away overtime, penalty rates.   

 

 I don’t know whether John Howard lives in a real world.  The real world out there  is this, and the real world in Sydney is even more emphatically the case:  if you  can’t get access to penalty rates in Sydney, you cannot pay your mortgage.  It’s  as simple as that.  It’s as simple as that.  I think that every working journalist  knows that.  I think that every mum and dad knows that they need those penalty  rates for their mortgage and they don’t like seeing their kids being smashed with  these things as their first experience of working life.   

 

 JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, a high-level Indonesian delegation arrives in  Canberra today.  Do you welcome the thawing of relations?   

 BEAZLEY:  Absolutely.  It’s always good to have a chat with our  neighbours.  We need good neighbours and we need to have a decent  relationship with our Indonesian friends.   

 JOURNALIST: What do you think needs to be talked about the most with  the Indonesians?   

 BEAZLEY:  I’m sorry that John Howard went down the road of changing  the boundaries of Australia and giving Australians the impression that our  migration laws are in somebody else’s hands.  What Howard really needed to do  was to sit down and talk sensibly through with the Indonesians the state of our 

 laws and how our laws were not aimed at them.  Unfortunately, he didn’t.  But I  hope that we have a good conversation with the Indonesians that come here  because nobody can tow us away from each other.  We’re here, geographically,  forever.     

 JOURNALIST: Do you think the poll question that suggests Australians  didn’t support the law reform was a little bit loaded because it tied in relations  with Indonesia and the changes to the Migration law?   

 BEAZLEY:  John Howard went the wrong road.  John Howard should  have been clear and emphatic in relations with our neighbours that there was  nothing in our laws that were an insult to them, nothing in the operations of those  laws which were a threat to them.  We regarded the unity of Indonesia as an  important Australian national interest.  John Howard should have done that and  he didn’t.  He raised a question mark.     

 Of course, when you don’t stand up for yourself you begin to give the impression  to the other fella that perhaps you’ve got something to be guilty about.  That was  very unfortunate.  But we’ve have many instances of that sort of inept behaviour,  inappropriate behaviour by John Howard in international affairs.  This is just yet  another incident.   

 JOURNALIST: Do you think that the off-shore processing legislation is an  appeasement?   

 BEAZLEY:  Obviously.  It’s put forward as an appeasement but it’s an  appeasement that wasn’t necessary.  A proper explanation was all that needed  to be done.  You have to do that.  You have to be able to simultaneously defend  your national interest and build good relationships.  You’ve got to be able to do  those two things.  You don’t have to sacrifice one for the other.  It might require a  bit of patience and it might require a bit of effort but it is absolutely essential.   

 JOURNALIST: What will Labor’s position be on the vote for the legislation?   

 BEAZLEY:  We oppose that legislation.  We have our own effective  border protection propositions which include things like coastguards and include  things like the appropriate use of Christmas Island.  This Pacific Solution now is  completely discredited.    

 JOURNALIST: What are you thoughts on the calls to scrap the Queen’s  Birthday Honours awards?   

 BEAZLEY:  These awards are terrific and I want to congratulate Greg  Combet on picking up a good award, and Olivia Newton John, John Coates.  A  lot of people have got great awards today.  We invented the system - Gough did,  Gough Whitlam - and I’ve always liked to see it in operation. 

 

 JOURNALIST: Do you think it is politicised, the board that selects the  awards?   

 BEAZLEY:  They try to get the best balance they can on it.  They’ve got  State representatives, they’ve got community representatives, they’ve got public  service representatives, they’ve got military representatives.  They do try to get a  decent balance on the committee that makes the awards.  I think the committee’s  not bad. 

 

 JOURNALIST: A non-political panel would be a better idea, though?   

 BEAZLEY:  It is effectively non-political.  It is pretty balanced.  Any  political tendencies in it are sort of checked by the breadth of it because you’ve  got State representatives on it.  They’re often of different political persuasions, or  their governments are, to the federal government.  I’ve always thought it worked  pretty well. 

 

 JOURNALIST:  (inaudible)  Socceroos?    

 BEAZLEY:  Oh, yeah, go the Socceroos.  There’s going to be bleary-eyed Australians tomorrow as they turn up to work after the long weekend and it  won’t be because they hung one on, it’ll be because they’ve been up watching  the Socceroos, as I will be myself.  I expect a fairly desultory day in Parliament  tomorrow as we suffer the effects of having celebrated a great Socceroos win.
