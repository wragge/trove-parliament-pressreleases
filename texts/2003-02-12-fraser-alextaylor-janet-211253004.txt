 Introduction 

 What are the impacts and implications of the increased gap between the rich and poor? While  there are debates among academic researchers about the measurement of the gap (Harding &  Greenwell 2002), it is an issue of wide community disquiet (Johnson & Taylor 2000) and of  importance for future policy directions. 

 Why should we be concerned about the gap between the rich and the poor? This paper examines  this issue from the experience and perceptions of children born in 1990 and growing up in low  and high-income households. It draws on findings of the Brotherhood of St Laurence’s  longitudinal Life Chances Study, which commenced in 1990 interviewing families with children  born in inner Melbourne in that year. The families in the study reflect the demographic diversity  of the original area. They are now widely dispersed across Melbourne and beyond. (For details  of earlier stages of the study see Taylor & Macdonald 1998; Gilley & Taylor 1995; Gilley 1993).  The sixth stage of the study in 2002 contacted 142 children now aged 11 and 12. Data was  collected from the children, their parents and teachers. The findings will be presented in detail in  the forthcoming report (Taylor & Fraser forthcoming). 

 This paper asks: 

 â¢ What are some of the different experiences and outcomes for children growing up in rich and  poor families?  â¢ How do 11 and 12 year old children themselves see their families’ financial situations? 

 The paper will conclude by raising questions about the wider policy implications of the gap. 

 Two different experiences 

 Two children from the study illustrate some of the issues. (Names and some details have been  changed to protect privacy). They had much in common. They were two 11 year old boys who  were born in the same year in the same inner Melbourne suburb. Both were living in two-parent  families with siblings. The fathers of both boys were employed. Both boys had attended a  government primary school and both had just started new schools in Year 7. Their teachers had  said they were doing well at the end of Grade 6. Both had good health. But there were also  differences which affected both the children’s current lives and could well affect their futures.  One family had been on a high income throughout the study, the other on a low income. Neither  family currently described itself as ‘rich’ or ‘poor’ and they were not the richest or the poorest in  the study, but they do illustrate something of the ‘gap’ that income causes. 

 ‘Every opportunity’  Mike was one of two children of an Australian-born couple, both with tertiary education.  Throughout the study his family have been in the high income category (above the cut off point  for the Family Tax Benefit). When Mike was 11 both parents were working full-time, as a  lecturer and a consultant, although his mother had not worked outside the home when the  children were very young. The family income was about $120,000 per year gross (about $2,300  a week). Mike was happy with the amount his parents worked as they did not get home too late  and could help him with his homework. 

 They owned their own house in the inner suburb where Mike was born. His parents saw it as a  good area, cosmopolitan and lively. Mike would have liked a bigger backyard.

 Mike had just started Year 7 at an independent school (annual fees $14,000, uniform $800). All  students had their own laptop and most homework was done on the computer. Mike said of  school: It’s good because you get to learn so much that you can get a better job when you’re older 

 and it’s pretty fun because everyday you get to meet kids, play with them at lunch and  recess … I like my school because the atmosphere in nicer … It’s really big. 

 Nearly every day after school and at weekends Mike was involved in Aikido, tennis and school  sports. His mother commented ‘He loves sport. So it’s the parental taxi service’. The family  recently had a holiday in Fiji. His favourite times with his family included going out together to  a restaurant or a movie. 

 Mike rated his family as having more money than most other families. Having money was  important for families because ‘if you needed something you’d be able to get it’. He had some  money saved: ‘I don’t really buy stuff, I like to just save it’. His mother said money ‘certainly  makes thing easier’. They had always managed well financially and hoped there would be  enough for the future. They were able to save money and she identified no costs for the children  that were difficult to meet. ‘I just hope that we provide every opportunity to allow him to make a  choice, career-wise, life-wise etcetera’. 

 When asked what might stop him doing what he wants to do when he grows up, Mike answered  confidently, ‘Nothing will stop me from achieving what I want in later life’. 

 ‘Just enough’  Lee was one of a large family of refugee parents from South-East Asia. The family has been on  low income throughout the study. His father who had only primary schooling before he came to  Australia had been unemployed for many years. He was now working full-time on a very low  wage washing cars. He brought home $350 or with overtime $400 (approximately $25,000 per  year gross). They also received Family Tax Benefit and Parenting Payment from Centrelink. His  mother had no formal schooling, had never been in paid employment and spoke little English.  She would have liked to be able to afford a sewing machine so she could work as a machinist at  home (but would need training and child care). Lee thought it would be better if his mother  worked: ‘She would get more money to pay the rent’. 

 Lee spent most of his childhood living in a flat in a high-rise public housing estate in inner  Melbourne. The family recently moved to a public rental house in a northern suburb, but are now  more isolated from friends and relatives. 

 Lee started in Year 7 at the local high school at the beginning of the year (school fees $174,  uniform $250). Lee said he didn’t like high school when he started, and spoke of being hit and  bullied. He said there was too much work and different projects at the same time, but he liked  sport. 

 His parents would have liked him to go to a church school but couldn’t afford it. His mother was  worried about the future and wanted a tutor for him. She found it hard to afford the uniform. She  saved the money for the uniform ‘otherwise the children won’t go to school if they don’t match’.  Overall the cost for Lee she found most difficult to meet was a computer: ‘The school wants the  kids to get computers’. 

 Lee played soccer once a week. He did quite a lot of cooking at home for the family. He had not  been away on holiday in the last year. His favourite times with his family were going on picnics

 Lee rated his family as having about the same amount of money as most families. He said money  is not so important: ‘Money is not like your life’. But he remembered: ‘When my father didn’t  work, we became poor. Wearing ripped clothes, some had holes’. That had made him feel ‘sad’.  Something he would have liked but which cost too much was Playstation. 

 Lee’s mother said:  Yes having money is very important so we can hire some tutors to teach the children their  studies … We have just enough for food and clothes for the children. … We are not rich  but not poor, we have just enough for the family. (Will you have enough in the next few  years?) If things go up like food, and electricity and housing rent is going up, then no. 

 His father would like Lee to be a lawyer, but his mother did not think they would have the  money for him to reach that stage. Lee said he wanted to be a computer programmer. What  might stop him doing what he wanted when he grows up? He answered: ‘Not learning and not  going to university’. 

 These two children illustrate the more general patterns found in the study of the opportunities  family income allows some children and the barriers low income sets up for others, ranging from  housing location and holidays to school choice and access to computers. 

 Besides family income, other differences Lee and Mike’s families illustrate include parents’  education and English language skills which affect both the help parents can provide with  homework and also the parents’ future ability to earn higher wages. 

 Family income and children  The Life Chances Study children show a variety of differences associated with family income.  The families were categorised into three income groups, taking into account family size (for  details see Taylor & Fraser forthcoming):  â¢ Low â family income below 120 per cent of the Henderson Poverty Line (about $34,000 for 

 a couple with two children)  â¢ Medium â between low and high  â¢ High â family income above the cut off point for eligibility for the Family Tax Benefit A 

 (about $87,000 for a couple with two children). 

 When the children were aged 11 and 12:  â¢ 27 per cent were in low-income families  â¢ 34 per cent in families with medium incomes and  â¢ 39 per cent in high-income families. 

 There had been both continuity and change over time: 74 per cent of the children who were in  low-income families when they were aged 6 months were still in low-income families 11 years  later. 

 Table 1 presents some of the demographic characteristics of the families in each income group.  The families in the low-income group in the study were significantly more likely than higher  income families to be sole-parent families, to have four or more children, to have both parents  from non-English-speaking birthplaces (NESB), to have parents with limited formal education,  and to have parents, particularly mothers, not in paid employment. These factors, especially in  combination, can present considerable barriers to families’ chances of improving their income  levels in the future.

 Table 2 presents some of the different experiences of the families. Low-income parents were  much less likely to own their own homes, rate their neighbourhood as ‘excellent’ for children, or  be satisfied with the financial support they can provide their children. However, low-income  parents were more likely to be satisfied with the amount of time they can spend with their child  than are others.

 *P Low-income families had greater difficulty in affording health costs and school costs for their  children, in spite of various concessions and in spite of the high private school fees paid by a  number of high-income families (Figure 1). Many also found it difficult to afford extracurricular  activities, such as sport or music.

While all the high-income families had computers and Internet access at home, fewer  than two-thirds of the low-income families had computers (and these did not necessarily work) and fewer than one-third had Internet access. (As a point of comparison in the week before the  2001 Census, 42 per cent of people had used a personal computer at home, ABS 2003).  Recreational activities were also very different, with children in low-income families much less  likely to have had a holiday in the last 12 months, or to be involved in sport or music or dance  lessons outside school (Figure 2).

Most of these 11 and 12 year old children saw  their family’s financial situation as much the same as most other families’ (Figure 3). A few  children in low-income families (18 per cent) estimated that they had less money than most  families, and over a quarter of the children in high-income families rating their families having  more than most. In contrast the parents’ views of their relative financial situation showed a  greater awareness of their position in society with an unequal income distribution but still with a  tendency to see themselves as average.  Looking at national figures, we estimate broadly that the children in high-income families in the  study would fall in the top 17 per cent nationally, while the children in the low-income group  would fall in the lowest 30 per cent (Taylor & Fraser forthcoming).

Responses ranged from ‘If you don’t have any money you  can’t live’ to (Lee’s comment) ‘Money is not your life’.  The children most often explained the importance of money for families in terms of being able to  buy food. The next most frequent responses included general comments about the need for  money, the importance of money for paying bills and for housing or shelter. A few children  mentioned specific school and other costs such as clothing or furniture.  Basically you need lots of money, you need to buy food with money, buy a house with  money, like beds and clothes and TV, pay your bills.  The small number who said money was not important mentioned happiness or family as more  important and one spoke of the problems of too much money:  No … and like sometimes when people get money somebody is jealous and somebody  might kill the one that has money. Over half the children in the long-term low-income families said their families had enough  money, while a few qualified this by saying ‘sometimes’ or ‘for some things’ and others said  they did not have enough. Their families lacked money for such things as school costs, bills,  food, clothing and to buy a house.  (…enough money?) Only for some things the family needs, but not for all. [Not for]  leisure and paying off the bills … sometimes my mum can’t pay for things so she  borrows money from my brother.  Sometimes for things like to pay money for school things and that, sometimes they pay it  late a little bit, they don’t pay it on the real day.  What was it like for the children when there was not enough money? Some were philosophical  about it, but when asked how they felt the words ‘sad’ and ‘bad’ and ‘upset’ were frequent.  The implications  The study’s starting point is the assumption that we want a society in which all children have  good opportunities to develop their potential and that we should all be concerned to ensure this  happens.  There can be debates about how much computer access is essential for 11 and 12 year olds and  whether multiple organised after-school activities are actually an advantage. However it is clear  from the study that the children growing up in low-income families were missing out on the  choices and opportunities enjoyed by children in more affluent families.  While this is a small scale study that cannot be generalised to all Australian children, it provides  examples of the experiences that many children are facing as they grow up. The Life Chances  Study illustrates some of the differences in the lives of children whose family income can  provide them with ‘every opportunity’ like Mike’s and those with ‘just enough’, like Lee’s.  The study also points to the long periods of time that some children live on low incomes, with  almost three quarters of the children who were in low-income families at 6 months, still in living  on low incomes at 11 and 12 years.  The findings confirm that money is not everything for children growing up - parents’ time and  family fun are important - but money is, none the less, crucial in our society.  In relation to the gap between ‘rich’ and ‘poor’, many of the children in the study at ages 11 and  12 were not very conscious of their financial situation in relation to the rest of the society, and  they saw their families as average. Some, however, were very aware of their families’ financial  struggles and the things they could not afford and they felt sad or upset and left out. Their  parents often feared for the future, with the increased costs and expectations of secondary school,  let alone tertiary education.  The findings raise a range of policy issues that will effect the life chances of children. One  priority is income adequacy for families. A second, particularly for children as they move into  secondary school, is the importance of access to high quality, low cost (free) education. This  calls for a strong government education system that is not seen as second best and that does not  perpetuate inequalities by requiring payments that exclude children from full participation.

 Views of money 

 Children and their parents were both asked to rate whether they thought their family had more  money than most families, about the same, or less. Most of these 11 and 12 year old children saw  their family’s financial situation as much the same as most other families’ (Figure 3). A few  children in low-income families (18 per cent) estimated that they had less money than most  families, and over a quarter of the children in high-income families rating their families having  more than most. In contrast the parents’ views of their relative financial situation showed a  greater awareness of their position in society with an unequal income distribution but still with a  tendency to see themselves as average. 

 Looking at national figures, we estimate broadly that the children in high-income families in the  study would fall in the top 17 per cent nationally, while the children in the low-income group  would fall in the lowest 30 per cent (Taylor & Fraser forthcoming).

 The importance of money: the children’s views  We asked 32 children who had been on low incomes throughout the study whether they thought  money was important for families. Responses ranged from ‘If you don’t have any money you  can’t live’ to (Lee’s comment) ‘Money is not your life’. 

 The children most often explained the importance of money for families in terms of being able to  buy food. The next most frequent responses included general comments about the need for  money, the importance of money for paying bills and for housing or shelter. A few children  mentioned specific school and other costs such as clothing or furniture. 

 Basically you need lots of money, you need to buy food with money, buy a house with  money, like beds and clothes and TV, pay your bills. 

 The small number who said money was not important mentioned happiness or family as more  important and one spoke of the problems of too much money:  No … and like sometimes when people get money somebody is jealous and somebody  might kill the one that has money.

 Over half the children in the long-term low-income families said their families had enough  money, while a few qualified this by saying ‘sometimes’ or ‘for some things’ and others said  they did not have enough. Their families lacked money for such things as school costs, bills,  food, clothing and to buy a house. 

 (…enough money?) Only for some things the family needs, but not for all. [Not for]  leisure and paying off the bills … sometimes my mum can’t pay for things so she  borrows money from my brother. 

 Sometimes for things like to pay money for school things and that, sometimes they pay it  late a little bit, they don’t pay it on the real day. 

 What was it like for the children when there was not enough money? Some were philosophical  about it, but when asked how they felt the words ‘sad’ and ‘bad’ and ‘upset’ were frequent. 

 The implications 

 The study’s starting point is the assumption that we want a society in which all children have  good opportunities to develop their potential and that we should all be concerned to ensure this  happens. 

 There can be debates about how much computer access is essential for 11 and 12 year olds and  whether multiple organised after-school activities are actually an advantage. However it is clear  from the study that the children growing up in low-income families were missing out on the  choices and opportunities enjoyed by children in more affluent families. 

 While this is a small scale study that cannot be generalised to all Australian children, it provides  examples of the experiences that many children are facing as they grow up. The Life Chances  Study illustrates some of the differences in the lives of children whose family income can  provide them with ‘every opportunity’ like Mike’s and those with ‘just enough’, like Lee’s. 

 The study also points to the long periods of time that some children live on low incomes, with  almost three quarters of the children who were in low-income families at 6 months, still in living  on low incomes at 11 and 12 years. 

 The findings confirm that money is not everything for children growing up - parents’ time and  family fun are important - but money is, none the less, crucial in our society. 

 In relation to the gap between ‘rich’ and ‘poor’, many of the children in the study at ages 11 and  12 were not very conscious of their financial situation in relation to the rest of the society, and  they saw their families as average. Some, however, were very aware of their families’ financial  struggles and the things they could not afford and they felt sad or upset and left out. Their  parents often feared for the future, with the increased costs and expectations of secondary school,  let alone tertiary education. 

 The findings raise a range of policy issues that will effect the life chances of children. One  priority is income adequacy for families. A second, particularly for children as they move into  secondary school, is the importance of access to high quality, low cost (free) education. This  calls for a strong government education system that is not seen as second best and that does not  perpetuate inequalities by requiring payments that exclude children from full participation.
