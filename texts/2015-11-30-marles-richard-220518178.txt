 THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION   MEMBER FOR CORIO 

 LIBERALS MUST CLARIFY REFUGEE TIMETABLE 

 Labor is calling on the Liberal Government to clarify its timetable for the arrival of the  12,000 refugees fleeing conflict in the Middle East with the Prime Minister and  Immigration Minister at odds over the timing. 

 Todayâ€™s Daily Telegraph reports Peter Dutton confirming the additional refugee places  will be drawn out over two years. 

 Yet, during his national security statement to Parliament last week, Malcolm Turnbull  said: "Australia has committed to accepting over four years an additional 12,000 people  who have fled the conflicts in Syria and Iraq." 

 The Abbott/Turnbull Government was forced to increase its humanitarian intake in  response to the Middle East conflict because of overwhelming community support, state  leaders and Labor demanding Australia help deal with the biggest refugee crisis to face  the globe since the Second World War. 

 The Liberal Government needs to provide certainty and transparency over the timing of  its additional refugee places.  

 Labor expects proper security, health and identity checks to be rigorously undertaken  for any person arriving. 

 Labor also expects that these 12,000 refugees be brought to Australia in as timely a  manner as possible.
