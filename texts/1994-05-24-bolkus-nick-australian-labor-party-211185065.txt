  GUIDELINES FOR STAY IN AUSTRALIA ON " I T A R I A N  GROUNDS 

  The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus, today released details  of guidelines under which people refused refugee status may be allowed to stay in Australia  on humanitarian grounds. 

  The guidelines replace those issued by the former Minister, Mr Gerry Hand, in 1991 for use  by the former Refugee Status Review Committee. They apply to people who are unable to  sustain a claim to refugee status but whose claims evoke a strong humanitarian response. 

  Senator Bolkus said that the guidelines will assist him in exercising his discretionary power  under Section 166BE of the Migration Act. This section allows the Minister to substitute for  a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal a decision more favourable to the applicant where  he considers it is in the public interest to do so. 

  "The Government wishes to provide a safety net for people who do not meet the technical  definition of refugee under the United Nations Refugee Convention and Protocol but who face  a significant threat to personal security, human rights or human dignity if returned to their  country of origin. " 

  Senator Bolkus emphasised that the Ministerial discretion is not designed to cover people  seeking residence on compassionate, non-refugee related grounds such as family, medical or  economic reasons. 

  "These guidelines have been developed on consultation with a range of voluntary agencies and  interest groups involved in helping refugees, " he said. "Their input has been constructive and  helpful. " 

  The guidelines address concerns community groups have expressed about the plight of people,  especially victims of torture and trauma, who have a genuine fear of return to their country  due to past events. 

  "The guidelines maintain a careful balance between ensuring deserving claimants are not  returned to face unacceptable treatment and opening the door to people who really do not  need Australia's protection. 'I

  GUIDELINES FOR STAY IN AUSTRALIA ON HUMANITARIAN GROUNDS 

  Purpose 

  The purpose of these guidelines is to provide a framework for recommending the grant of  stay in Australia to persons of humanitarian concern who do not meet the requirements  for refugee status but who face hardship if returned to their country of origin which  would evoke strong concern in the Australian public. 

  Lepislative Framework 

  2. 

  and s166HL of the Migration Act 1958 to grant an entry permit to a person who is  physically present in Australia and has been determined by the Refugee Review Tribunal  or the Administrative Review Tribunal not to be a refugee if the Minister considers such  action to be in the public interest. 

  The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has a discretion under s166BE 

  3.  the Act where their cases were decided by a review officer prior to 28 October 1993.  There may also be persons eligible for humanitarian consideration under s115 of 

  Scope of Guidelines 

  4.  dignity of the individual, i t  is i n  the public interest to offer protection to those persons  whose particular circumstances and personal characteristics provide them with a sound  basis for expecting to face, individually, a significant threat to personal security, human 

  rights or human dignity on return to their country of origin. 

  In accordance with Australia’s coinmitment to protection of human rights and the 

  5. 

  grounds to a person in the following circumstances:  It is in the public interest to ensure that protection is offered on humanitarian 

  (i) Persons with Convention related claims in the past and continuing subjective fear: 

  the applicant may have been a refugee at the time of  departure from their country, but due to fundamental changes  in their country, is not now a refugee and it would be  inhumane to return them to their own country because of  their subjective fear. For example, a victim of torture and  trauma who is likely to suffer further trauma if returned to  their country. 

  (ii) 

  (iii) 

  Persons likely to face treatment closely approximating persecution: 

  the applicant has individually been subject to a systematic  program of harassment or denial of basic rights available to  other residents of their country which falls short of  persecution. 

  Persons facing serious mistreatment which while not Convention related  constitutes persecution : 

  - the applicant has been personally subjected to human rights  violations or personal degradation for non-Conven tion  reasons and protection of their country is not assured; 

  the applicant faces inhumane or degrading punishment if  returned to their country. 

  Other Considerations 

  6.  where the applicant’s fears are well founded and based on serious grounds presenting  threat to personal security, intense personal hardship or abuse of human rights. The  provision is not intended to address cases where the applicant: 

  Grant of residence on humanitarian grounds must be limited to exceptional cases, 

  - has a safe third country in which to reside and that country  would accept the person; 

  could substantially alleviate perceived risk by relocating to a  region of safety within the country of origin; 

  - meets criteria for entry under other programs eg special  group concession; 

  - has been the victim of actions that are more properly  classified as criminal in nature, rather than Convention  related. This is particularly so where such action is unlikey  to be repeated. 

  is seeking residence in Australia principally on non refugee  related grounds like family, medical or economic reasons, or  to secure a more stable environment in which to live. 

  Reseonsibilitv of Case Officers 

  7.  Tribunal under s166E(2) of the Act, a Departmental officer may, in accordance with these  guidelines, refer the case for the Minister’s consideration under this public interest  provision although the Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise his  power. 

  When the Department receives the decision regarding a rejected case from the 

  8.  Australian society or security. The Minister’s criminal deportation policy should be a  consideration. 

  It may not be in the public interest to approve a person who poses a threat to 

  9. 

  account. They are indicative of the types of cases that may be appropriate for  consideration by the Minister. They are not intended as a set of criteria but as a  framework which can be interpreted broadly where there are compelling claims for  consideration of humanitarian access. 

  These guidelines are not exhaustive of all the matters which may be taken into
