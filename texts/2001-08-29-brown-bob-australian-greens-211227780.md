 Howard Turns Tampa Situation into Crisis

 NZ’s Helen Clark Does the ALP’s Job

 Greens Senator Bob Brown has called on John Howard and Kim Beazley to help calm down emotions and prevent the Tampa crisis getting further out of hand.

 “The boarding of the Tampa by the SAS has turned what was a worrying situation into a crisis,” Senator Brown said.

 “430 asylum seekers seeking entry into Australia is not a national emergency but John Howard has turned it into one.

 “This move to uses troops is abhorrent.

 “Every hour this crisis goes on Australia’s reputation sinks further. Our tourism industry, or marketing potential, our economy go with it.

 “The Prime minister has shown ineptitude and lack of heart is his dealing with the situation from the start.

 “He should have phoned the NZ Prime Minster Helen Clark at the start. She has shown a willingness to deal with the situation humanely: she would have taken the asylum seekers ashore.

 “And the Labor Federal Opposition doesn’t deserved to be called an opposition. Its lack-lustre perforce is an embarrassment.

 “Helen Clark in New Zealand has shown Labor how to keep humanity to the fore,” Senator Brown said.
