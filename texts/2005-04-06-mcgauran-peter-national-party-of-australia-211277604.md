 Media Release 

 New Settlement Grants Program

 6 April 2005 

 A discussion paper on a new $30 million dollar settlement grants program for migrants and refugees was released for  comment today.

 The new program will be better able to meet the needs of people settling in Australia and replaces funding previously  provided under the Community Settlement Services Scheme (CSSS) and core funding to Migrant Resource Centres.

 The paper is seeking submissions from the community sector on a new Settlement Grants Program, which will help  migrants and refugees realise their potential and participate fully in the wider community.

 The Australian Government Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Peter McGauran, said the new program  will commence on 1 July 2006 and involves around $30 million in settlement funding in the first year, including $2.4  million of new funding for new and enhanced grants.

 “In 2004-05, Australia will welcome 13,000 refugees and humanitarian entrants from some of the world's poorest and most  war-ravaged countries. More than 8,000 of these people are from African countries, including Sudan, Burundi, Ethiopia, 

 Sierra Leone and Liberia.

 “This new program will help migrants and refugees settle as quickly as possible and build rewarding lives in Australia ,”  Minister McGauran said.

 “The Government recognises the important role the community sector has played in supporting new arrivals to settle in  Australia, and the new program aims to strengthen this involvement.”

 The discussion paper will allow community groups to comment on how best to implement the new program, with face to  face consultations to be held in all capital cities in April and May, and interested parties invited to provide written  submissions.

 “This will allow the new program to provide a better delivery of settlement services, and allow more effective targeting of  settlement funding to those most in need,” Minister McGauran said.
